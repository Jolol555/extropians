Robert J. Bradbury:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Regarding your proposed stellar management/disassembly processes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I agree that the ideas would be useful -- but can the physicists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manange to pull the rabbit out of the hat?  Yep, we can slow light
</em><br>
down.
<br>
<em>&gt;But that doesn't imply that we can negate gravity or the processes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it drives.
</em><br>
<p>spike:
<br>
<p>No rabbits or hats.  Use ordinary physics as we know it with
<br>
some imaginative engineering, starting with your own concept
<br>
of an Mbrain made up of nodes with reflective surfaces.  We
<br>
could concentrate the sun's output onto a small region of the
<br>
sun's surface.  (You DID burn stuff with your mother's makeup
<br>
mirror as a kid, right?  If not, you were the only kid to have
<br>
never done this.  That being said, it is still not too late to 
<br>
have a misspent childhood.)  
<br>
<p>That superheated region of the sun gets hot enough that many 
<br>
of the atoms achieve escape velocity from the sun's surface.  
<br>
The resulting expanding blob of material is then differentially 
<br>
heated by the reflecting MBrain nodes, in such a way as to
<br>
herd the material into a solar-orbiting subcritical blob of
<br>
hot hydrogen, which loses much of its heat via radiation 
<br>
very quickly (a few million years or less).  The hydrogen 
<br>
is then available for chemical reaction with the available 
<br>
heavier elements or for controlled fusion into heavier elements.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;I simply prefer some reasonably concrete evidence before I'm sold.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Evidence schmevidence.  An ounce of imagination is worth a pound
<br>
of evidence.  Robert you have tons of that.  
<br>
<p>Humans are apparently the first emergent sentience here in
<br>
this galaxy.  In principle, the first sentience in any galaxy
<br>
will be puzzled as to why it is alone.  If there were other
<br>
intelligences in this galaxy, I am at a loss to explain why
<br>
they aren't here by now, as well as everywhere else.  Perhaps
<br>
we do not yet recognize ETI because we do not know what it
<br>
looks like.
<br>
<p>Do let us mercifully spare the next emergent ETI this puzzle by 
<br>
getting to its star and being there waiting for it to emerge.  
<br>
<p>We would subsequently devour it, of course.  But at least it would
<br>
spared the excruciating uncertainty about why it was not being 
<br>
devoured, as humans are currently doing.
