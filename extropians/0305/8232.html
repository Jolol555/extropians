<p><em>&gt; I think that the majority of Americans (people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less interested in the rigor of intellect and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic of a group like this as well as less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inclined or able to analyze the details and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure of arguments being presented to them)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are consistently tricked, duped, programmed - by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a language that denies or regretfully forgets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the major discoveries made by physicists in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1920's and anthropologists ever since.
</em><br>
<p>But that was prior to 1933 when we all got
<br>
straightened out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Namely, that there are multiple interpretations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of every situation, i.e. light seem like a wave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we test it like this and a particle if we do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it like this.  I.e. peace loving hippies or dirty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jobless, commies i.e. &quot;Jimmy Carter takes a cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shot at president Bush!&quot; or &quot;Jimmy Carter, Tellin'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it like it is.&quot; etc . . .
</em><br>
<p>Curious how until 1933 humanity had not been yet
<br>
favored by evolution to adopt appropriate and sane
<br>
speech patterns.  One might have thought that given
<br>
several hundred thousand years, nineteen civilizations,
<br>
innumerable tribes and nations and societies competing
<br>
with each other, better techniques of thinking and
<br>
reasoning were not stumbled upon.  So the burden of
<br>
explanation must now lie with those who claim that
<br>
the ways humans think now and have been thinking
<br>
since 1610 are unfit.
<br>
<p>(It is well to keep in mind that those societies which
<br>
produce the highest viable birth ratios, e.g. Europe
<br>
before 1910 and the United States before about the same
<br>
time, are the most fit.  Today European biological
<br>
fitness has reached in some places the incredible 1.1
<br>
---unsurviveability to an extreme degree.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe general semantics and a course of logic should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be included in journalism schools.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is indeed sad to see even young reporters who
<br>
lapse immediately upon graduation to the two-valued
<br>
prevalent aristotelian orientations, adopt bad s.r,
<br>
e.g., fail to adopt *structural* and multi-ordinal
<br>
semanitic relations, employ elementalistic terminology,
<br>
intensional definitions, employ undue generalization,
<br>
unanalyzed linguistic habits., to such a degree that
<br>
it's probably too late to re-educate the younger
<br>
generation with null-A non-habitual s.r, remove
<br>
semantic blockages,.
