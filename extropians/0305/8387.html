I must say I am surprised, albiet very pleasently, to see an article like
<br>
this on Anti-War.com  Columnist Justin Raimondo blasts the now pro-sanction
<br>
Leftists for the absurdity of their position.

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Remember how the sanctions were the equivalent of 'genocide'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;committed by the Evil American Imperialists against the Oppressed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peoples of Iraq? Well, that was then, according to Rahul Mahajan,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... but this is now ...&quot; (5/14/03)
<br>
<p>from - <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/justin/j051403.html">http://www.antiwar.com/justin/j051403.html</a>
<br>
<p>-Excerpts-
<br>
<p>&quot;Power politics, it seems, is a bit more complex than the &quot;America, bad,
<br>
everybody else, good&quot; doctrine of the Third World Left.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;What this boils down to is: who gets all that Iraqi oil? Rahul wants the UN
<br>
to get it...The war, it turns out, was mostly a scheme so that&quot; the United
<br>
States will be able to use Iraq's money to pay off mostly American
<br>
corporations.&quot; And that's not fair! Why not let some of the other nations –
<br>
who, after all, just stood around and watched as the U.S. beat up the
<br>
schoolyard weakling – in on picking the victim's pockets? Why, those greedy
<br>
American imperialists! &quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;First we are told that the evil U.S. is intent on building &quot;permanent
<br>
bases,&quot; and then we are lectured that the Americans have an &quot;obligation&quot; to
<br>
rebuild an entire nation – yet how, exactly, will that be done without
<br>
setting up permanent American bases? &quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;There are apparently no limits to the illogic induced by anti-Americanism,
<br>
a delusionary doctrine in which Washington is – and must be – the root of
<br>
all evil&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The United Nations is itself an agent of foreign domination over subject
<br>
peoples; look at Bosnia and Kosovo, where the ethnic cleansing of Serbs and
<br>
the eradication of all political rights was ratified by UN overlords.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;the United States is by its very nature a potentially liberating force in
<br>
the world. The idea that no good could possibly come of this war is
<br>
obviously wrong. But it is not far off the mark, either, and needs only to
<br>
be amended: Nothing good for the U.S. can come of this war. All the
<br>
benefits, such as they are, will be reaped in Iraq&quot;
