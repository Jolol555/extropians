<em>&gt; The less efficient foods one consumes the fewer people the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet can support.
</em><br>
<p>Does anyone know of a food list or cookbook that could be used a
<br>
decision support tool when buying/consuming foods.  I have seen books
<br>
listing calories and even rating fast foods in terms of how bad they are
<br>
but nothing rating foods in terms of the best nutritionally.
<br>
<p>For instance if a great many of the foods that people consumed were
<br>
rated 1 to 10 in terms of desirability from a nutritional standpoint, it
<br>
could be used when shopping or ordering from a menu to determine which
<br>
dishes would be healthiest.  It's not always easy to tell due to added
<br>
salt, butter, sauces etc...  
<br>
<p>For instance most people would say spinach would rate high, but as I
<br>
learned on this list there are many other greens that have higher iron
<br>
content than spinach.  But iron is just a single mineral.  Which
<br>
vegetables provide the maximal nutritional benefit?
<br>
<p>Even if I did not buy all the highest rated foods when I shopped due to
<br>
price or personal tastes I would still probably bring home a much
<br>
healthier selection based on the knowledge than I do now.
<br>
<p>I like the idea of an Extropian diet.  We could take the highest
<br>
nutritionally rated foods and find recipes that maximized the use of
<br>
them.  Recipes could be designed to be prepared in ways that did the
<br>
least nutritional damage to the ingredients in the preparation process.
<br>
Each recipe could have suggested side dishes that would complete
<br>
proteins, add missing nutrients that the main dish did not provide
<br>
etc...  If sweeteners are required the recipes could list a
<br>
nutritionally preferred low-cal sweetener quantity instead of sugar.
<br>
<p>It would be a great thing to add to our Wiki when we get it. (Hint hint)
<br>
Then Extropian could take a crack at contributing their own recipes and
<br>
others could rate them or make suggestions for improvement.

<p>That is exactly what I mean by &quot;expensive.&quot; Animal foods are less
<br>
economical sources of calories than many other foods. This is true for
<br>
individuals, for societies and for humanity in general. This argument
<br>
however does not speak to the question of optimal diet.

</em><br>
<p>Obviously so, but we can nevertheless speak statistically about the
<br>
human genome and the diet to which it is best adapted. Individual
<br>
deviations from the standard paleodiet would then be prescribed after
<br>
genetic analysis indicated that such deviations would be beneficial.
