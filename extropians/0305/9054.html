Some spolier comments for the Animatrix:
<br>
<p><p>The Animatrix is a nice complement to the films.  Overall, the animatrix
<br>
stories set in the basic setting the movies show are often less
<br>
interesting than the other (this is also true for the cartoons and short
<br>
stories on the site; Neil Gaiman's take
<br>
<a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/neil_g.html">http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/neil_g.html</a> seems to mirror
<br>
the distributed processing view we tend to like here, and plays wildly
<br>
with the Matrixverse).
<br>
<p>I have already pointed out how &quot;The Second Renaissance Part I&quot; decidedly
<br>
takes the machine side. I found the descriptions of how the
<br>
ultra-efficient &quot;Nation of 01&quot; causes economical trouble rather
<br>
intriguing; a kind of reverse comparative advantage where almost all
<br>
manufacturing can be done better by the AI nation than human nations - I
<br>
really wonder what conditions could bring that about.
<br>
<p>&quot;Detective Story&quot; is apparently set in an alternate, film noir Matrix -
<br>
but Trinity is present, suggesting that the Matrix may be reformatted
<br>
from time to time and/or that the Animatrix doesn't care about
<br>
continuity. I love the snow animation. 
<br>
<p>The &quot;Last Flight of the Osiris&quot; is a fairly straightforward story, most
<br>
worth watching for very good computer graphics and the interesting game
<br>
of &quot;strip swordfighting&quot;. The swarming of the squidbots is beautiful -
<br>
if I ever get a reason to send out replicating killer robots or nanofogs
<br>
I promise to at least think a bit of their movement patterns. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Beyond&quot; is a poetic little story that does a nice job of showing how
<br>
bugs in the Matrix might behave; the Matrix universe has some wonderful 
<br>
surrealism potential. &quot;World Record&quot; is another story set in
<br>
an alternate Matrix; more inspirational than philosophical. &quot;Kid's 
<br>
Story&quot; is visually interesting but too much standard teen angst to grab 
<br>
me. 
<br>
<p>My total favorite is &quot;Matriculation&quot;. Drawn by Pete Chung, it is Aeon
<br>
Flux meets the Matrix (I'm positive that the protagonist is Aeon herself
<br>
- which might be a spoiler to how she ends up ;-). Beautifully drawn,
<br>
very well characterised (designed?) machines, and a different take on
<br>
how the human resistance could work: by convincing AI to join them.
<br>
There is some interesting discussion about the ethics of just recoding
<br>
the AIs vs. convincing them - and whether the convincing really is a
<br>
form of coercion, since the AIs might be too literal-minded to
<br>
understand that the human visions of co-existence and symbiosis are not
<br>
reality yet. 
<br>
<p>I guess the film trilogy has to end in some triumphant way that makes
<br>
sense - the audience would kill otherwise and it is bad for business :-)
<br>
But these stories show that there is plenty of room of alternatives in
<br>
the matrixverse, not just different interpretations of a basic setting
<br>
or exactly what is true or false, base reality or virtual, but also what
<br>
it is about. 
<br>
