<em>&gt; Ah, I wondered whether you were thinking of something like this.  That

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal wouldn't have accumulated in the first place because they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; break it down, so if you then relieve the handicap they will go ahead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and break it down.  What this paper doesn't tell us (I've just read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the full text) is the key question: do the apoE-/- mice with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transfected human apoE have less lesion at 199 days old than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age-matched apoE+/+ mice?  I bet they have more -- &quot;complete&quot; in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; title is misleading, since the text says there was a reduction from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 220 to 28 mm^2 lesion area, only a factor of eight.
</em><br>
<p>### So you are postulating a major chemical difference between fatty streak
<br>
in apoE null mutants and in aged animals. Would it also apply to humans with
<br>
hereditary hypercholesterolemia vs. aged humans?
<br>
<p>This is a legitimate hypothesis, but I'd need more data before I would
<br>
accept it.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### Genetically determined obesity (e.g leptin deficiency) manifests
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; early in life, and yet we know that maintenance of body weight is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dynamic balancing process, and can be tilted early or late in either
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; direction. You can have fatty streaks appearing early and developing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; very fast, if your LDL is very high, in hereditary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; hypercholesterolemia, or they can develop slower, if you have only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the Western diet going against you. The balance can be out of kilter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; because of hereditary, or acquired changes in your genome, or due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; non-genetic changes (like formation of insoluble aggregates). So far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we have insufficient data to answer the question of the specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; contribution of such factors in PD, AD, and, AFAIK, in most other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; aging-related conditions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see the relevance of this.  My point about fatty streaks in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; childhood is that they appear in the context of a normal diet: we all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get them in our aortas by the age of ten.  I agree fully that changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to how much you push a homeostatic system will cause changes in its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equilibrium state (just like Desurmont's mice), but we're not talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about any such changes here.
</em><br>
<p>### Interestingly, there are some lucky seniors who even at age 80 do not
<br>
have atherosclerosis. If indeed there was an inexorable accumulation of
<br>
indigestible material in most of us, how do they escape it? Would you say
<br>
they do not make such supposedly insoluble plaque (hard to imagine,
<br>
cholesterol oxidizes the same way in all humans), or do they have superior
<br>
lysosomal enzymes?
<br>
<p>The equilibrium model, without significant insoluble material, handles this
<br>
question better. The healthy seniors have probably a host of beneficial
<br>
traits, like better mitochondria, more durable stem cells, more active
<br>
antioxidant defenses, a better liver, all adding to the ability not to lay
<br>
down plaque, or to dissolve it better than others.

<em>&gt;&gt; ### My boss, Davis Parker, likes the idea of clonal expansion, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Why do you think COX negativity must precede hyperproliferation if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this hypothesis is true?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It doesn't need to do so in ALL mechanisms of clonal expansion, by any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means -- but in Patrick's model, hyperproliferation must precede COX
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negativity, no question.  I claim that my model for the mechanism of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clonal expansion (BioEssays 19:161) is the most consistent with all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available data ... but then I would, wouldn't I :-)
</em><br>
<p>### I went over Chinnery's articles (Am J Hum Gen, Lancet) and I didn't find
<br>
any clear statement that hyperproliferation must precede COX negativity.
<br>
Where do you think he says that it does?
<br>
<p>Non-specific hyperproliferation in response to a biochemical abnormality
<br>
sensed by the cell is not a necessary part of his hypothesis, although it is
<br>
added as a secondary process after the clonal expansion to fit with the
<br>
existence of MERRF and possibly other conditions characterized by mtDNA
<br>
accumulation. In fact, hyperproliferation may well be triggered by COX
<br>
negativity. After all, COX negativity is observed once the level of a
<br>
mutation (at least in cases of single nucleotide substitutions) exceeds
<br>
50-60%, and the proliferation may be a frantic rescue attempt. This would be
<br>
more or less unrelated to the normal mechanisms of mtDNA copy maintenance,
<br>
which probably involve sensing total mtDNA mass, rather than energy levels.
<br>
<p>Talking about your model (and most selection models) - if indeed the mutated
<br>
genome has a selective advantage, then cells with more mt genomes would be
<br>
at a higher risk of suffering a mutation (this risk goes up as a simple
<br>
function of the number of genomes), and once a single mutation is present,
<br>
such cell would very quickly shift to 100% mutated genomes, as a result of
<br>
selection. This means that large cells would be more likely to be COX
<br>
negative than smaller cells. In fact, very large cells, like the ovum, and
<br>
the syncytial muscle fiber, with 100 000 mtDNA's, and very small or
<br>
quiescent cells, like chondrocytes, with only 1000 to 5000 mtDNA's, would
<br>
differ in the accumulation of mutations by an order of magnitude or more. Is
<br>
it indeed the case?
<br>
<p>The random drift model is much less dependent on the copy number per cell,
<br>
and predicts that the COX-negative percentage will vary by a factor 2 even
<br>
if copy number is varied by two orders of magnitude, which AFAIK is in
<br>
agreement with observations, as limited as they are.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### If the effective number of mtDNA genomes undergoing replication
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is smaller than the total number of mitos, then drift can occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; pretty fast.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True -- &quot;stem mitochondria&quot; is how Bruce Ames has described this.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it really only works if the effective number is 1, because there seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be very few cells with anywhere near a 50/50 ratio of wild-type to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutant genomes -- indicating that cells pass through that middle phase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot faster than drift should allow.  Evidence for stem mitochondria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is conspicuous by its absence, so far.
</em><br>
<p>### Chinnery was able to get simulation results consistent with experimental
<br>
observations even without stem mitochondria. The model works very well with
<br>
anything from 100 to 10 000 mtDNA copies per cell, definitely it is not
<br>
necessary to postulate a single proliferating mitochondrion. There are
<br>
pretty few data on single cells, especially the data derived by sequencing
<br>
of clones rather than direct PCR sequencing, but Chinnery's model indicates
<br>
that the number of cells with 50% mutated genomes will be actually pretty
<br>
low, on the order of a few percent in aged humans, well agreeing with some
<br>
of the crude data available.
<br>
<p>This said, without doubt, our understanding of the dynamics of mitochondrial
<br>
replication and mutational changes is in its infancy.
