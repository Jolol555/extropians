<p>
Harvey,
<br>
<p>I don't think your conclusions after reading the full text in any way refute
<br>
the abstract or the media hype. The media claim from the article I cited
<br>
from the Science Daily site at
<br>
<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/05/030522083022.htmis">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/05/030522083022.htmis</a> is that
<br>
Atkins &quot;May Be As Effective And Safe As Conventional Diets.&quot; It is not a
<br>
claim that Atkins is superior to conventional diets.
<br>
<p>However Atkins might very well be superior. I note the following indications
<br>
(from the abstract):
<br>
<p>Though the difference in weight loss between the two diets was not
<br>
statistically significant, the means were nevertheless very different. On
<br>
Atkins people lost about 4.4% of body weight after one year, while on the
<br>
conventional diet they lost only 2.5% of body weight. So then on average,
<br>
Atkins dieters lost almost twice as much weight as conventional dieters at
<br>
the end of one year. 
<br>
<p>While these results are not statistically significant, they are still
<br>
noteworthy. In addition to the difference between the means, statistical
<br>
significance is function of 1) the standard deviations of measurements in
<br>
the two groups and 2) the number of data points in the study. The greater
<br>
the number of data points, the greater the statistical significance, which
<br>
suggests that if things continued as they were for more than a year then the
<br>
Atkins dieters would look very good relative to the conventional low-fat
<br>
dieters. Unfortunately the study ended at one year.
<br>
<p>I note also that healthy HDL increased more on Atkins than on the
<br>
conventional diet. I don't have the actual numbers for HDL, LDL, VLDL (if
<br>
any) or total cholesterol (you have the numbers from the full text, I
<br>
suppose) but this seems also to be a result strongly in favor of Atkins.
<br>
<p>That said, I think Atkins is only a half-step in the right direction. I
<br>
applaud the late Dr. Atkins for eliminating agricultural products but I wish
<br>
he had taken the next step: the elimination of dairy products.
<br>
