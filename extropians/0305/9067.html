<p>&quot;Golden rice&quot; and most other GMO crops (or animals) are what
<br>
one could call &quot;gene splicing&quot; products.  But all natural
<br>
breeding (think of the varieties of roses) are &quot;gene mutation&quot;
<br>
products.  Most modern agricultural products are combinations
<br>
of &quot;gene mutation&quot; and &quot;gene breeding&quot; products.  Gene breeding
<br>
could be viewed in some ways as a &quot;natural&quot; form of &quot;gene splicing&quot;.
<br>
Humans have been selecting and breeding from both &quot;natural&quot; and
<br>
&quot;generated&quot; (using radiation) mutations for many many years
<br>
(the &quot;natural&quot; approach since the dawn of agriculture).
<br>
<p>This is a major reason that scientists who really understand
<br>
genetics and the history of crop development view the GMO
<br>
crop debate as somewhat contrived.

<br>
<p>P.S. A &quot;Google&quot; on &quot;Golden rice&quot; and daffodils provides some
<br>
interesting reading.  The genes added to produce &quot;golden rice&quot;
<br>
are &quot;natural&quot; but somewhat foreign.
<br>
<p>P.P.S. A good percentage of &quot;natural&quot; mutations are generated by &quot;natural&quot;
<br>
radiation (e.g. cosmic rays, radioactive potassium or UV radiation) so any
<br>
debates about the use of radiation to produce new types of crops is pretty
<br>
specious too.
