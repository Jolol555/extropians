<p>Unless the discovering unit includes an translator, I would think that 
<br>
any barrel with Arabic (or Russian, Persian, whatever) writing on it 
<br>
would be suspicious.
<br>
<p>Neither of the example reports you give say the plain truth: 'Barrels 
<br>
were discovered. They did not contain WMD'. So say you're an embedded 
<br>
reporter with one of these units and it's been a slow day. If you're 
<br>
female, the troops are asking about your decade-long porno career (see 
<br>
Mike Wiener, aka, Mike Savage). They can't read the writing on these 
<br>
barrels, you can't read it, it's 'suspicious'. You get your 15 seconds 
<br>
on the news which means you keep your CNN/MSNBC/FOX job another day.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile Joe Sixpack is sloshing it back with fellow hicks at the 
<br>
saloon and says 'Yup, they's got dubya-em-dee! They's discuverin' 
<br>
barrels of it left and raght!' (See, when the report is on, he's 
<br>
thinking of her decade-long porno career too and not actually listening, 
<br>
even if he could comprehend the report).
<br>
<p>Just the fact that it's on TV makes it a true fact in the minds of many. 
<br>
Some news show I was watching called the pilot who flew Bush to the 
<br>
carrier a 'hero'. (Maybe he was: I wonder how many times he had to say: 
<br>
'Please be quiet, sir, I must concentrate on the mission'). Jeez,
