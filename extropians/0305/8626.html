<p><em>&gt; Jared Diamond: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Archaeologists studying the rise of farming have reconstructed a crucial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stage at which we made the worst mistake in human history. Forced to choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between limiting population or trying to increase food production, we chose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the latter and ended up with starvation, warfare, and tyranny.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It also set us on the path towards culture, superhuman intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the stars. While I am no fan of technological determinism, to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent the &quot;choice&quot; of farming leads to a competitive situation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanding population, brainpower and civilization that rewards expanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our ecological niche and likely transforming our species. 
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.  The &quot;paradise&quot; of living a hunter-gatherer existence,
<br>
which, Jared Diamond not withstanding, could also often be brutish
<br>
and short, wouldn't be for *me*, even assuming that &quot;I&quot; somehow
<br>
could be other than the product of a 20th century civilization
<br>
(as, I would definitely say, all of us are).
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hunting and gathering was a local maximum; getting out of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is never going to be fun. I'm all for it, though.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and I hope that it's meant that we ought to get out of the
<br>
local maximum and advance to a better destiny, for everyone's
<br>
sake.

<em>&gt; &gt; Let's not forget standing armies.  Agriculture enabled people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; produce more food than they needed to feed themselves alone, enabling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the rise of a ruling class that subsisted off other people's work and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could force them to work 16-hour days to feed as many boss-class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals as possible. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, before agriculture there was no ruling class.
</em><br>
<p>I would say that from the standpoint of individual psychology, only
<br>
*now* are most people free.  Living in a small hunter-gatherer band
<br>
would have meant for most people enduring the domination of a few
<br>
particular (and doubtlessly loathsome) people.  One of the glorious
<br>
things of civilization is the individual's ability, by and large,
<br>
to isolate himself from unpleasant people.
