<p>### Don't lose faith. Anti-hunters in Britain almost managed to shut down

foxhunting, their counterparts in Italy brutalized bird hunters into

submission, etc. etc. Your time might come yet.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't feel any need to remunerate hunters for loss of &quot;hobby&quot;,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; molesters, an expression of scorn, and possibly a psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; manipulation, well beyond the tame interpretation you advanced above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well then *they* don't know how to read or think logically.
</em><br>
<p>### Them Extropes, poor saps.
<br>
<p>-------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Life, freedom and truth, for their own sake, are what I want, all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; else is a bonus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then I hope one of your bonuses will be happiness. And I hope you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discover the truth about how animals can be appreciated more than you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now appreciate them.
</em><br>
<p>### Oh, I do appreciate animals, like my dogs, quite a lot, but since I do
<br>
not imagine they are persons, I would never suggest the use of violence to
<br>
advance their interests against humans.
<br>
<p>-------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### You are anthropomorphizing deer. They do not attach significance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to a longer life, since they do not have the concept of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; time-invariant self. Therefore killing them is ethically neutral,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and if it results on average in reduced suffering (freedom from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wildcats, diseases of old age, accidents, etc), like a shot to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; heart, it is clearly ethically superior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be anthropomorphizing if I equated, wrongly, anything in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular about a deer with something about a human. But that is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case. Deer do not need to have a concept of self at all in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to enjoy a longer life, or a life free from gunshots.
</em><br>
<p>### Originally you used the words &quot;to attach significance&quot;. This is not the
<br>
same as &quot;enjoy&quot; (which indeed can be atemporal), and to attach significance
<br>
to a long life you have to have a concept of a long life to begin with, a
<br>
concept of self. If you agree that indeed deer do not have a concept of self
<br>
(as you seem to imply above), then I'd agree you are not anthropomorphizing.
<br>
Of course, if deer have no self, they are not individuals, and the length of
<br>
their life has no ethical significance, but becomes a mere question of
<br>
usefulness for humans.
<br>
<p>------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Attaching ethical significance to longer life of deer is like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; attaching significance to the wishes of inanimate objects, so common
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in animists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In order to argue logically, you have to avoid obvious fallacies, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this one, false analogy.
</em><br>
<p>### Why false?
<br>
<p>--------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### How many deer have you sterilized? Was it fun?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I haven't sterilized a deer, but I've sterilized many other animals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And it made me feel good about myself, that I was doing so to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an excess of unwanted animals who could not be cared for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### You see? You can do good without voting, too.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; ### Deer are &quot;individuals&quot;? How do you know? How many have you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; talked to?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This question moves through fallacy into the comic, so I will assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you aren't interested in an answer. I can *see* you've made up your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind, and since I am not arguing to convince myself, I'll let you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the last word again.
</em><br>
<p>### I was actually quite serious here. I have the impression that you've
<br>
made up your mind about deer and possibly even fishes being persons. I don't
<br>
know where it comes from. Since I use a combination of the Turing test and
<br>
inference from structural analysis to detect personhood (which deer fail on
<br>
many counts), I wanted to know what other methods do you use to find that
<br>
deer are unique individuals (in an ethical sense).
<br>
<p>------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### Just wait a few decades and even this will be possible, thanks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to the market-driven and government-supported progress of science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; All you need is to clone the DNA, assemble it into a genome, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; voila, you have your mammoth steak, and T.Rex-safari.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The market will provide... IF I wait a few decades and IF there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viable DNA sample ... and IF I can afford the product.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The market is a pretty poor excuse for a deity, don't you think?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### Well, when I was 5 years old I stopped praying to the Almighty, since my
<br>
prayers never got answered, but the market seems to deliver. I'll stick with
<br>
this faith for now.
