<p>No -- I was simply looking at the &quot;generally accepted&quot; reserves and
<br>
dividing it by the maximum ever production capacity (i.e. when the
<br>
equipment was in the best shape, perhaps when the prices were highest,
<br>
etc.)
<br>
<p>Since at least 2 of the 3 countries cited (Iraq &amp; Russia) could
<br>
presumably be classified as 3rd world, the costs of exploration and
<br>
production of more oil are presumably fairly low (a few $/barrel)
<br>
unless, like Russia, one is dealing with an exhaustion of reserves.
<br>
Presumably Saudi Arabia isn't much different since they can import
<br>
cheap arab labor for the oil industry from less oil-rich arab states.
<br>
<p>The numbers I've seen indicate that 10's of billions of $ may be
<br>
required to get Iraq's production back up in the 3 billion barrels/day
<br>
range (or even push it closer to the Saudi 7-8 bbl/day levels).  But
<br>
that is still probably chump change compared to what was spent to
<br>
remove Saddam and/or what would be required to reinvigorate the
<br>
Russian oil industry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd be quite suspicious of cost estimates that were more than 5-10 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the future.  Remember the spike.
</em><br>
<p>Yes Charles -- we know.  But given the contraction of the VC industry over
<br>
the last 3 years (Y2K: $90B Y2002: $19B) and the mumblings I hear in the
<br>
VC industry that everyone has contracted their outlooks -- [they will fund
<br>
companies producing revenue *tomorrow*] -- the &quot;spike&quot; is in the swamp.
<br>
<p>One only has to look at historic U.S. stagflation and/or current Japanese
<br>
deflationary trends to raise at least one eyebrow and wonder whether the
<br>
&quot;spike&quot; is on course or adrift in the ocean.
<br>
<p>If you were aware of the bioterrorism risks that I'm aware of you would
<br>
realize that it doesn't take much hit to significantly derail whatever
<br>
path &quot;the spike&quot; is on.
<br>
<p>As the saying goes -- it ain't over until the fat lady sings.
