<p><em>&gt; &gt; What's vernier voting?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### MP's first vote extensively on what they want - they vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on hundreds of issues of interest, with the results available for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everybody's perusal. The votes do not become law, though -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until there is a vernier vote. Each MP has to decide on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree of majority needed to pass all of the previously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voted-on issues. E.g. you voted for a ban on abortion and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 51% of MP's did, too. But if vernier vote sets the majority at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 51%, then you might have to accept a ban on prayer in public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parks, voted on by, say, 52% of MP's. If  your minimum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority is too low, you end up with a lot of laws you hate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because there will always be some majorities against you. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, if you set your minimum majority too high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (99%?), you will end up with laws against murder not being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passed. Presumably, most humans would choose the kind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of majority least likely to impose a lot against their wishes, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still making sure the really important issues are addressed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vernier voting offers an opportunity to choose the whole set 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of social parameters based on one aggregate vote, taking into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consideration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflicting wishes, rather than voting on everything piecemeal, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and losing the sight of the big picture. I am not sure how it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would work in practice, but I would definitely give it a try. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't cure the short-sightedness inherent in democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics, but it should improve the conflict-resolution among 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competing demands.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting idea. But aren't you overlooking the need for MPs 
<br>
and parliaments to respond to urgent exogenous shocks. Lots
<br>
of things economic, military, epidemiological, can change that are 
<br>
outside the national boundaries and planning horizons of MPs 
<br>
weighting things up in a given parliamentary session yet still need
<br>
a response. How would the Vernier voting cater for the 
<br>
unexpected and urgent issue? Perhaps a need or the desirability 
<br>
to declare marshal law say or to to impose a quarantine due
<br>
to a particular outbreak.
