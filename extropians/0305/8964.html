<em>&gt;&gt; ### Do you have a hypothesis as to what this difference might be?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What are the postulated non-degradable molecular species?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quite a few are known; luckily, one of my prospective collaborators on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this work, Keri Carpenter, has been at the forefront of research on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the chemical composition of atheroma for many years.  Mostly they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oxidation products of cholesterol, such as 7-ketocholesterol.
</em><br>
<p>### But is 7-ketocholesterol the non-degradable molecular species?
<br>
<p>According to: Lyons MA. Brown AJ.Metabolism of an oxysterol,
<br>
7-ketocholesterol, by sterol 27-hydroxylase in HepG2 cells.Lipids.
<br>
36(7):701-11, 2001 Jul., it is well-metabolized in the liver.
<br>
<p>---------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; A key question is, are there any other comparably legitimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; hypotheses?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### The dynamic equilibrium hypothesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think you ever explained how that hypothesis can be reconciled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the appearance of fatty streaks so young.  That's my main problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the hypothesis -- the advance of lipid deposition seems to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuous, lifelong process.
</em><br>
<p>### If the balance is tilted towards formation of foam cells (e.g. by
<br>
ingestion of dietary poisons, like trans-fatty acids, or by genetic factors
<br>
in familial hypercholesterolemias), you will have them early on, and you
<br>
could have your first heart attack in grade school (or in your forties if
<br>
you have only margarine going against you). Dynamic equilibrium integrates a
<br>
number of factors and processes, and predicts shifts in the average age of
<br>
symptoms onset, as well as at least partial reversibility.
<br>
<p>We already discussed reversibility of atherosclerosis, I think. Since you
<br>
can observe a bulk reduction in the atheromas in human carotids with some
<br>
dietary interventions (vit. B supplementation) as measured by Doppler
<br>
sonography, the majority of pathologically relevant material responsible for
<br>
artery occlusion is apparently digestible and is removed if the equilibrium
<br>
is forced back towards lipid removal. If there are truly indigestible
<br>
molecular species present in the atheroma, they would form only a part of
<br>
it, and would not have a pathological significance in the age range that
<br>
humans currently achieve.
<br>
<p>-------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### I found the following: Homma S. Ishii T. Tsugane S. Hirose N.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Different effects of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; natural history of aortic atherosclerosis by the stage of intimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lesions. [Journal Article] Atherosclerosis. 128(1):85-95, 1997 Jan 3.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Apparently even at around age 79 you still find people with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intimal lesions. How did they escape their accumulation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for this reference.  I would need to consult someone like Keri
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be sure, but I think the explanation is just random sampling of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few sites within the aorta rather than examination of the whole aorta.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to this paper's Fig 2, 2/3 of those in their 20s had no foam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells; this is ostensibly at odds with the consensus (stated in, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, Jake Lusis's review in Nature 407:233) that they are usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present in the first decade.
</em><br>
<p>### Lusis mentions the early fatty streaks without qualifications - but
<br>
AFAIK, there are large differences in the age of onset of atherosclerosis
<br>
between ethic groups. The Japanese, who were the subject group in Homa's
<br>
study, seem to develop lesions later (presumably due to lifestyle factors).
<br>
Homa didn't do a random sampling of the aorta - all samples were taken from
<br>
predefined locations.
<br>
-----------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### I don't understand. The mutants take over mainly as a result of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; stochastic processes, with no clear mitochondrial proliferative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; response to partial loss of function. There is a substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; functional reserve of mitochondria, and the nucleus seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; maintain a constant mass of genomes (at least in some experimental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; paradigms), so there is no mitochondrial hyperproliferation until
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; very late in the process, if at all. Since the stochastic hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; makes no reference to the cause of hyperproliferation, merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; predicting the emergence of COX-negativity, it is compatible with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; either hyperproliferation before COX negativity, after, or none at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; all, if the cell simply decides not to upregulate mitos. These two
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; processes are most likely largely independent, over large range of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; heteroplasmy levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, Chinnery's model *does* specify the cause of hyperproliferation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He says that the cell maintains the same number of *functional* mt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genomes.  Hence, he concludes that the random fluctuation of wild-type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versus mutant genomes will push the number of mutant genomes up along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the wild-type when the wild-type randomly diminish, but won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; push it down again when the wild-type randomly exceed the necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number.  Whereas in real life, just as you say, no clear mitochondrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proliferative response to partial loss of function is seen.
</em><br>
<p>### Chinnery specified the &quot;maintenance of wild-type mechanism&quot;, yes, but
<br>
AFAIK he didn't say that random fluctuations are irreversible and cannot
<br>
push the total number of genomes back down (except when driven to
<br>
homoplasmy). His model applies to functionally neutral mutations (Am J Hum
<br>
Genet 2001; 68: 80206.), with the maintenance of wild-type being an add-on
<br>
to the hypothesis, meant to help explain MERRF-like phenomena. There are
<br>
threshold effects for derangements of mito function by various mutations,
<br>
ranging from 30 to 95% mutated genomes needed to produce a detectable
<br>
pathology. The cell cannot read the quality of its mtDNA genomes directly
<br>
(at least, so we believe), so it must use a biochemical sensor to decide
<br>
when to push mtDNA replication higher. Since the biochemical derangements
<br>
appear late because of the thresholds, even if the cell tries to maintain a
<br>
certain constant level of mito function, it will only react with
<br>
proliferation to advanced heteroplasmy, and in an inconsistent, tissue- and
<br>
mutation-specific manner, just as seen in real life.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He has a new paper out about this in J Theor Biol which explains and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extends the model somewhat.
</em><br>
<p>### Is it in review? I can't find it on Medline.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### In the CNS there are neurons with enormous differences in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cellular mass, from tiny interneurons to the giant alpha motor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; neurons. The giant ones do have a very active metabolism. If indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; single deleterious mutations had a significant replicative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; advantage, the large neurons would die much faster than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; interneurons, which is not the case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um, hang on -- there are at least three things wrong with this logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, neurons die of lots of things, not just OXPHOSlessness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, they don't necessarily die even of OXPHOSlessness, because if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they did then we wouldn't see COX-negative ones accumulating with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age.  And third, most brain regions (of whatever size) have far fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; COX-negative neurons than the substantia nigra.  It could be that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is because they resist apoptosis in the substantia nigra more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than elsewhere, but chances are that it's mutation rate, because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the H2O2 production associated with dopamine synthesis.
</em><br>
<p>### Well, one way or another, large neurons would be generally much more
<br>
likely to be either COX-negative or dying, by more than an order of
<br>
magnitude.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Also, we know that the mutation level in single neurons in elderly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; adults is in the range of 50 to 800 diverse aminoacid-changing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mutations per million bases (according to Simon and Beal), meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that more than ninety percent of genomes are mutated, and without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; doubt many of them are deleterious. This leaves little place for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; preferential amplification of low psi or otherwise impaired mitos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, not so fast.  Are you referring to Hum Mol Genet 11(2):133?  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping an open mind about that study until the appearance of a ms in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preparation that that article cites, but it's not clear to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they made a compelling case for the reliability of their quantitation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, they made no allowance for the isolation of mtDNA that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was in the process of being degraded because of damage (see Suter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Richter, Biochemistry 38(1):459).  The acid test is the single-cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis being done so effectively by Khrapko's group, who have now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started serious work on neurons (see Mech Ageing Dev 123(8):891 as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting point).  It's possible that only deletions clonally expand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and point mutations don't, but I doubt it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### Yes, Hum Mol Genet 11(2):133, and Simon &amp; Beal did a poster at the
<br>
recent AAN meeting, showing more data on single neurons and homogenates. I
<br>
also refer to our unpublished data which agree with their findings.
<br>
<p>According to the poster, each single cell has an accumulations of a small
<br>
number of types of mutations but each present at higher frequency (10-15%),
<br>
which in the homogenate changes to thousands of types of mutations present
<br>
each at a very low level (less than 1%).
<br>
<p>Thanks for the Suter ref - very useful (actually I should say - extremely
<br>
useful, I just added it to the discussion in my article).  Khrapko seems to
<br>
lean towards the random drift model in the article you quoted.
<br>
<p>The possibility that the mutation rates calculated for mtDNA could be
<br>
influenced by oxidative damage to the DNA has to be taken seriously, of
<br>
course, but our data show that there is a significant difference between the
<br>
frequency of mutations in the D-loop and in the protein-coding regions, by
<br>
almost an order of magnitude. If all the mutations we observe were due to
<br>
degradation of the DNA, then we would expect that the frequency would be the
<br>
same for both areas, unless there is a significant influence from e.g. SSB
<br>
vs. MTFA interactions. Also, the size of the fragmented, highly-oxidized
<br>
mtDNA in Suter's article is about .2 to .5 Mb. We amplified fragments of 1
<br>
kb to 4 kb, and gel-purified the DNA to exclude smaller fragments, in both
<br>
cases finding the same overall mutation frequencies, indicating that the
<br>
mutations are not from the oxidized mtDNA which would be excluded by our
<br>
approach, especially with the longer PCR products. Finally, most types of
<br>
DNA damage seem to block PCR rather than introduce errors, which is the
<br>
basis of some methods for adduct detection.
<br>
<p>BTW, I just read the abstract of your paper in Protoplasma - sounds
<br>
intriguing, but the full text is not available online. Could you send me a
<br>
copy?
