Robert Bradury said:
<br>
&lt;&lt;But Adams and Laughlin have a reasonable chunk of it right
<br>
given our current knowledge of physics. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>:So does Issac Newton
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I have not tried to reconcile Dyson with their perspective and suspect our 
<br>
current knowledge of the nature of the universe(s) may not be complete enough 
<br>
to do so.
<br>
<p>:Yes, although they ought to be the pennultimate authority, frequently there 
<br>
seems to be enough wiggle-room, for even the best theories to be fungible.  
<br>
For example; many prominent cosmologists (Linde for example) view the recently 
<br>
observed evidence for acceleration, as quite possibly to be a sometime thing in 
<br>
the cosmos. That the acceleration will halt and reverse, and may have already 
<br>
done so. Many astronomers may disagree, and say that this is a permanent 
<br>
fixture. I see no point in being pessimistic in a intellectual realm where they 
<br>
absolutes that we may crave, are themselves merely one fixture in an 
<br>
increasingly difficult to understand universe. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;But I do agree with DM, DE, quintessence, etc. everything is very much up 
<br>
in the air right now (and it doesn't make me (personally) very happy).
<br>
Robert&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>:Understood. Hence the need, for us on this list, for scientists who are 
<br>
problem solvers; including existential problem solvers. Dr Perlmutter, who helped 
<br>
uncover the accelerating phenomena of the cosmos; seems not to be. At least 
<br>
not the existential problems that we on this list are fascinated with. Its no 
<br>
accident that Kurzweil, as a thinker, is more often quoted then Perlmutter.
