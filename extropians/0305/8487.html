<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It was a rhetorical question, Karen, to illustrate what I expect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; become a new insanity defense. Since sociopaths are already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; recognised as not regarding their victims as people, this treads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; on well established areas of insanity defense case law. Whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; there is any distiction between your three different analyses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and which one is accurate, apparently will be put to various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; juries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ^^^^^^^^^ Usually I find people who answer rhetorical questions to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; annoying. In spite of that, I thought real discussion of the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to this question might be interesting.  Your question caught my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attention mainly because I did not know what you meant by a &quot;new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sort of insanity defense&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, while many suicides and murders have been blamed by their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetrators and families of victims on certain rock music, I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware of any violent crimes blamed on a particular movie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^The movie Natural Born Killers was accused of being the cause of
<br>
a violent murder in Louisiana in 2002. The decision was an appellate level
<br>
court, and it affirmed the lower court decision  that the movie did not
<br>
incite the violence.  I would not be surprised if there have been other
<br>
movie cases, and also cases involving the violence of video games.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As our technology advances more and more, virtual realities will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve ever greater levels of reality. Being able to distinguish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between reality and virtuality will become a significant social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem, with the most extreme example being violent crime perpetrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by individuals who sincerely beleive they are acting within a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation and not within reality. I would call this Virtuality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Syndrome: the belief that one is living within a simulated universe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accompanied by dissociative disorders like sociopathy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schizophrenia.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^I can imagine that happening, but not until, as you say, our
<br>
technology advances more. I imagine that if we were at the level of the
<br>
Matrix then there would be perhaps such a problem.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Always interested in your response, Karen. You are consistently an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent poster.
</em><br>
<p>^^^^^^Excuse me while I make sure Rafal reads that! ;)
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; What concerns me is whether this will be accepted as an excuse or not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and what the results will be.
</em><br>
<p>^^^^^^^Back to discussing our current level of VR technology and the use of
<br>
the Matrix (for example) as a defense.  In our current state of tech, I
<br>
don't see this as any different a defense than blaming video games or movies
<br>
or rock'n roll. It won't work; I don't believe any case has succeeded on the
<br>
merits of one of those arguments.  The only way I see such arguments coming
<br>
in to play at all would be as evidence to bolster the affirmative defense of
<br>
legal insanity (the test for which is not altered by the Matrix defense).
<br>
However, if a jury is really not convinced by the defense medical expert's
<br>
testimony that the accused was insane at the time of the crime, then adding
<br>
the argument that &quot;S/He was insane: s/he really believed we were in the
<br>
Matrix&quot; is very unlikely to sway the jury.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, for any claim that the Matrix played a role in the crime to
<br>
succeed, it needs to be given not as the primary evidence that the person
<br>
was insane, but as secondary evidence. The primary evidence will always be
<br>
given by expert medical witness testimony, prior medical/psych history, and
<br>
behavior. I don't believe we are anywhere near accepting such arguments as
<br>
primary evidence (a term I am making up, btw).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, if Virtuality Syndrome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes as serious a problem as I think it will,
</em><br>
<p>^^^^^^^At first, I thought you meant in the near future; now I don't think
<br>
you do. Although I would like your guess to be over-reaching, there are a
<br>
few facts that make me unsure if it will become a problem of some severity
<br>
or not.  The first is the human tendency toward suspicion of what it does
<br>
not understand. That suspicion doesn't lead most people to seek truth or
<br>
understanding, but to fabricate, and then to believe what they fabricate,
<br>
which leads to a second fact. The human mind's ability to fool itself (I am
<br>
getting sleepy here at 234AM, but I think you know what I mean here). Third,
<br>
a news story which I cannot find right now on Google.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime around the year 2000, a group of Believers sold all their
<br>
belongings and moved to Israel believing that Christ was returning in the
<br>
year 2000. Among the reports coming from that region at that time, one was a
<br>
medical report. There is an occurrence in Israel which is so common among
<br>
tourists that the Israeli doctors have named it. I Googled, but I couldn't
<br>
find the story anywhere.  The medical condition is a mental/psych condition
<br>
characterized by the person's belief (new belief upon being in Israel) that
<br>
they are actually living in biblical times. It is &quot;cured&quot; with a short time
<br>
in the hospital.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is scary; and depressing. It makes me think that you may be
<br>
right Mike.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we do, in fact, live within a simulation, as some like Nick Bostrom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have posited, then we must also form a moral imperative to respect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights of intelligent life in other simulated realities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musn't we do that then even if we are not a simulation?
