</em><br>
<p>Yep, I distinctly recall the blue people because I thought your
<br>
interpretation might not have included the brief discussion we
<br>
had on the E-list about them (Perhaps a year ago, we had
<br>
several emails exchanged about where the idea originated, I
<br>
think I had Googled and came up with a Twilight Zone episode
<br>
but Damien may have come up with the actual story from which
<br>
it was derived.)  I recall being somewhat puzzled regarding
<br>
whether you might have read those emails and/or were simply
<br>
finding the idea appealing from a novelty standpoint.
<br>
<p>So I recall the blue people discussion reasonably well.
<br>
The MBrain discussions may include a mental gap on my part
<br>
(I've been thinking about MBrains for so long that conversations
<br>
with respect to them don't have any novelty value.  So I may
<br>
discard the information with the same ease that you would
<br>
discard comments about AIs that are inherently obvious to you.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Clearly what the world needs is a more sophisticated Fun Theory.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this (and the subsequent analysis).  The real pain
<br>
this is going to get into is that most of what is considered &quot;fun&quot;
<br>
happens to be related to pre-programmed instincts that are
<br>
involved in either survival or reproduction.  Once you remove
<br>
those drives/instincts/etc. there is going to have to be a lot
<br>
of rewriting of the &quot;code&quot; that needs to be done with respect to
<br>
precisely what &quot;Fun&quot; is.
<br>
<p>Regarding your proposed stellar management/disassembly processes,
<br>
I agree that the ideas would be useful -- but can the physicists
<br>
manange to pull the rabbit out of the hat?  Yep, we can slow light down.
<br>
But that doesn't imply that we can negate gravity or the processes
<br>
it drives.
<br>
<p>I simply prefer some reasonably concrete evidence before I'm sold.
<br>
<p>Robert
