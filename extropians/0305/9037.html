<em>&gt; (Gary Miller &lt;<a href="mailto:garymiller@starband.net?Subject=Re:%20Why%20the%20interest%20in%20really%20big%20primes?%20Re:%20new%20confuser">garymiller@starband.net</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't wish to offend anyone or lay on a big guilt trip but here goes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea of wasting CPU cycles on primes and searching for ET when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are worthy projects like <a href="http://www.find-a-drug.com/">http://www.find-a-drug.com/</a> trying 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to find cures for diseases like cancer just makes me question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how much we really care about our fellow man. 
</em><br>
<p>The thing about basic research is this: it is not even remotely
<br>
possible to know what line of research will lead to the most lives
<br>
being saved in the long run. Yes, finding a drug that cures HIV
<br>
would be a marvellous thing, and is probably within the realm of
<br>
near-term possibility. But it may very well be an obscure mathematical
<br>
result of some kind that enables some totally unforeseen technology
<br>
that conquers death itself, or that makes spaceflight practical, or
<br>
that enables the next great comminication medium that empowers
<br>
everyone. There's just no way to know.
<br>
<p>So sure, if you want short-term results like finding conventional
<br>
treatments for existing diseases, then find-a-drug might be a good
<br>
place to use your CPU resources. But the big leaps are likely to come
<br>
from more basic research into nature itself, like protein folding,
<br>
or even GIMPS. Yes, even SETI might accomplish something spectacular.
<br>
There's just no way to know.
