<em>&gt; Hang on. Isn't that &quot;memoriz*ing* information switches one's genes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on and off&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>That certainly my non-expert take on it. Neurons (nerve cells) with
<br>
dendrites, axons etc are &quot;constantly&quot; changing shape connecting and
<br>
reconnecting with each other in relation to intracellular signalling (which
<br>
would turn genes on and off). Genes don't *directly* make anything
<br>
structural in a cell, structural like a dendrite, rather the structure of
<br>
the
<br>
cell is altered as a result of interactions from proteins (cytokines,
<br>
hormones etc) they cause other particular proteins (the physically
<br>
structural components of cells) to be expressed, transported to the
<br>
relevant site in the cell and assembled into the structure or made into
<br>
an enzyme (a working protein). The whole thing is dynamic not static.
<br>
<p>Already memor*ized* information is unlikely to require the same sort
<br>
of physical construction of connections - they're already there. Maybe
<br>
though, there is some level of maintenance activity required for us to
<br>
retain the connections (memories) that are in place as the protein
<br>
physical constructs would certainly degrade over time. Perhaps accessing
<br>
a memory is stimulation enough to cause some sort of minor maintenance
<br>
or reinforcement construction to be done with expressed proteins.
<br>
<p>But, hey, I'm getting out of *my* depth here pretty quick and stand
<br>
ready to be corrected.
