<p>You keep making good points about how competition between humans and between
<br>
large groups of humans in the post-agricultural revolution world helped to
<br>
fuel advancements like writing and math. I agree. The greater complexity of
<br>
the new societies certainly must have accelerated our intellectual progress.
<br>
<p>However it is important to realize also that the most remarkable
<br>
achievements of the human mind did not happen as a result agriculture or its
<br>
ramifications. The &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot; for humanity is better dated circa
<br>
40,000 BC. It was then that symbolism, art and other forms of communication
<br>
became widespread. 
<br>
<p>This is to say that we were already clearly on the path to the development
<br>
of math and written language long before we started sowing seeds, stealing
<br>
the milk of animals, and building businesses and cities. It would seem that
<br>
large complex competitive societies were as much a result of our symbolic
<br>
capacities as they were a cause of them.
