<p>
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of America site
<br>
(<a href="http://genomics.phrma.org/today/index.html">http://genomics.phrma.org/today/index.html</a>) is one I occasionally
<br>
check out. The bounty seemed a little richer today.
<br>
<p>*Stem cells can become &quot;normal&quot; sperm.
<br>
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993700">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993700</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Researchers are very close to creating sperm outside of the body
<br>
for the first time, New Scientist has learned.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As reported on 1 May, the feat has already been achieved with
<br>
eggs. It was accomplished with cells originally derived from mouse
<br>
embryos, but most experts see no reason why the technique would
<br>
not work with human embryonic stem cells too. If human eggs and
<br>
sperm created this way are healthy - and it is a big if - the
<br>
implications for reproductive technology and regenerative medicine
<br>
would be immense.&quot;
<br>
<p>*Genetic regulator of lifespan identified   (PNC1 gene)
<br>
<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-05/hms-gro050503.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-05/hms-gro050503.php</a>
<br>
&quot;Researchers at Harvard Medical School (HMS) have discovered that
<br>
a gene in yeast is a key regulator of lifespan. The gene, PNC1, is the
<br>
first that has been shown to respond specifically to environmental factors
<br>
known to affect lifespan in many organisms&quot;
<br>
<p>*Gene holds clue to long life.        (PNC1 gene again)
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3007157.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3007157.stm</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Researchers in the United States have identified a gene in yeast that
<br>
influences how long it lives.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They believe the finding could boost efforts to identify similar genes
<br>
&nbsp;in humans.&quot;
<br>
<p>How RNAi Will Untangle Gene Function
<br>
<a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/articles/view-article.asp?Article=200357152811">http://www.genomeweb.com/articles/view-article.asp?Article=200357152811</a>
<br>
&quot;Some call it the most revolutionary biological tool since polymerase
<br>
chain reaction. Nobel laureate and Biogen founder Phil Sharp says
<br>
it will &quot;fundamentally change how we do cell biology.&quot; And technology
<br>
licensing officers at the Carnegie Institution and MIT, which sell
<br>
&nbsp;commercial rights to two separate pools of patents for RNA-mediated
<br>
-interference technologies, say that these could well be the most
<br>
significant
<br>
&nbsp;inventions, at least in biology, ever to cross their desks.
