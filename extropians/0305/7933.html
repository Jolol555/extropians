<p>&nbsp;How many markets do you expect to have? It's hard to accept the assumption
<br>
that they're hard to manipulate if there are a large number of them (which
<br>
probably prevents them from having much liquidity) and much of the relevant
<br>
info is kept secret by the government, or the market suspects that it is
<br>
being kept secret.
<br>
&nbsp;Futarchy would be quite valuable for broad policy decsions, but it's not
<br>
obvious that it would be valuable for frequent decisions of the kind an
<br>
individual policeman makes. I'd suggest a better way to use futarchy to
<br>
handle the problems you mention is to use it to evaluate better methods
<br>
of insuring that an unbiased grand jury will quickly review any arrest.
