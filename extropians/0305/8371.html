<em>&gt; Yes, now that this story is 24 hours old, denials from (Ret) Major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Daniel Hunt, on FoxNews, have disputed the BBC story as being full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of holes. One story had US Forces firing blanks, which is untrue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The second claim that the hospital was unguarded is also untrue,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the hospital was guarded by 25 armed Fedayeen. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The BBC reported the massacre of thousands of Arab civilians, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jenin, in April 2002 on the West Bank, unverified and given to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BBC by the PA. A later UN examination of Jenin listed 57 verified 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fatalities, not thousands. Most all of the killed were combatants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BBC misreporting was also apparent in the American attacks against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Chetnik regime in Bosnia, but thats another story, in a long 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line of stories, not honest reporting, performed by the Leftist BBC.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am convinced that all news orgs lie; but I as a reader, must 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to discern, which one is lying the least, so that I can know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is true. I suggest that all list members keep this in mind, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swallow published statements so whole heartedly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't comment on the Blanks, whereas I should have. In the live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; report from the hospital that was broadcast. During the interviews
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Doctors/Patients, they showed numerous bullet holes in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walls of the hospital ward where Jessica was kept. Allegedly fired 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the Special Op's during the rescue.  They also showed what was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described as 'grenades' that were used in the raid. These appeared 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be standard flashbangs or smokes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I remember, there was no mention of the armed Fedayeen.
</em><br>
<p>Flash bangs are the typical grenade used in situations where
<br>
noncombatants may be mixed in with combatants. The point is to stun all
<br>
the people so the SO has time to pick out the bad guys and pop them
<br>
off.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't be suprised by no mention of the armed Fedayeen. Hospital
<br>
administrators in any hospital in Iraq are most certainly Baath Party
<br>
officials. Anything they tell the press cannot be trusted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I missed the reports of the Jenin Massacre, So I can't comment. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over exaggeration doesn't surprise me at all. Although in general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the News from the BBC is usually very factual, it sometime omits 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information and portrays things with a leftist slant. 
</em><br>
<p>It always portrays things with a leftist slant. It is only discernable,
<br>
though, when the slant is detectably different from the current
<br>
Government line. If the government is a leftist party, the government
<br>
is going to issue leftist slanted propaganda more often than not on
<br>
domestic issues.
<br>
<p>As for al Jazeera now becoming subscription, it is because before they
<br>
couldn't give away access, cause nobody here gave a damn about what a
<br>
bunch of weird arabs were yapping about. Now it is a hot commodity, so
<br>
it is worth money to charge for it.
