<p><em>&gt; What stories? As <a href="http://www.historian.net/hxwrite.htm">http://www.historian.net/hxwrite.htm</a> puts it about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some cave paintings: &quot;As long ago as 25,000-30,000 years BP, humans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were painting pictures on cave walls. Whether these pictures were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telling a &quot;story&quot; or represented some type of &quot;spirit house&quot; or ritual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercise is not known.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Of course no one knows with absolute certainty whether the paintings tell a
<br>
story, but some of them certainly do seem to tell a story. For example
<br>
yesterday in response to this thread I started browsing the web for
<br>
prehistoric cave paintings, and found one that appeared to be a depiction of
<br>
a hunter. On his right there were 2 beasts of some kind. On this left were 4
<br>
beasts of some other kind. (I'm going from memory here. I think those were
<br>
the quantities of beasts -- however the exact numbers are not important
<br>
here). I would guess the painter was painting a picture-story about an
<br>
especially memorable hunting expedition, and that he knew the difference
<br>
between &quot;2 beasts&quot; and &quot;4 beasts&quot; even if he could communicate those numbers
<br>
only by painting the number of objects.
<br>
<p>Other paintings look like true works of art, made for the sake of art alone
<br>
(or perhaps for religious reasons). The skill of some paleolithic painters
<br>
was actually quite amazing. I know I could never paint as well as some of
<br>
them. The paintings are a reminder to me that paleolithic peoples were not
<br>
so very different from us. The graceful strokes apparent in some paintings
<br>
show that at least some paleos were very sensitive and artistic. Paleo
<br>
people were not just stupid brutes as they are so typically characterized to
<br>
be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; but I think it is a mistake to think something fundamentally new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; happened to human mental capacity at the advent of agriculture. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; think it was a difference only of degree. The real breakthrough to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; symbolic thinking took place at least some 30,000+ years earlier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. And many ritual symbols found in the cave paintings likely led to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, well this is my point. You wanted evidence for &quot;a move in that
<br>
direction&quot; toward writing and math prior to agriculture. Cave paintings are
<br>
exactly such evidence. 
<br>
<p>I agree of course that our intellectual progress accelerated dramatically
<br>
when we settled into complex farming societies. I just wanted to make it
<br>
clear that this was only an escalation of a process that started long before
<br>
the advent of agriculture. We cannot thank agriculture for the ability to do
<br>
math and write language. We can thank it only for adding more selection
<br>
pressure to the development of these traits that were already under pressure
<br>
for development anyway. There is no reason to think we would not have made
<br>
it to this level eventually even had we never learned to plant seeds.
<br>
Farming only got us here faster.
<br>
<p>We humans are, by nature, curious about the world. This trait of curiosity
<br>
is I think at the root of intellectual progress. Farming did not make us
<br>
curious. It only made us fat. :)
