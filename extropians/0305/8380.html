In Windows XP it is not necessary to buy any software to convert text to an
<br>
audio file. A program called Narrator, included with XP, will read text
<br>
aloud (I just a moment ago listened to Microsoft Sam read Harvey's message).
<br>
Word XP also the built-in text-to-speech engine. The Text-to-speech function
<br>
in Word can read text from Word documents in any font (no need to convert to
<br>
text). Narrator will even read web pages directly in any font while ignoring
<br>
the HTML codes.
<br>
<p>To start Narrator from the start menu, go Accessories|Accessibility|Narrator
<br>
or just type &quot;narrator&quot; at the run command. If everything is set up properly
<br>
then it will read this message aloud after you place your cursor in the
<br>
message field (in Outlook and Outlook Express at least - not sure about
<br>
other email clients).
<br>
<p>All that is needed is a way to convert that audio output to a file. MS
<br>
Narrator does not provide a record function, nor does the speech function in
<br>
Word, but a free utility I found called &quot;OpCode:Direct2Disk&quot; does the trick.
<br>
There are probably several other such free utilities available from
<br>
shareware sites. 
<br>
<p>Opcode saves the Narrator output to a .wav file. Other similar utilities
<br>
might save directly to .mp3. If one needs to convert a .wav file to .mp3
<br>
then most audio players will do the job and also record the .mp3 to a CD-R.
<br>
I use Musicmatch Jukebox, which came bundled free with my Sony DVD writer.
<br>
Some audio players might even handle the whole job, eliminating the need for
<br>
the recording utility.
<br>
<p>A few years ago I wrote a program in Visual C++ called &quot;Blackjack Pro,&quot;
<br>
which utilized a Microsoft Activex Control called &quot;Microsoft Agent.&quot; The
<br>
program had both text-to-speech and speech recognition capabilities. It was
<br>
designed to teach people how to count cards and beat the casinos at
<br>
blackjack (an old hobby of mine). In teaching mode, the program listened to
<br>
the verbal commands of the player (e.g., &quot;Hit&quot;, &quot;Stand&quot;, &quot;Double Down&quot;,
<br>
&quot;Split&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, etc) as the player spoke into the microphone. If the
<br>
player tried to make a bad play then a little blue genie would pop up on the
<br>
table and say something through the speakers like &quot;Sorry Mate, but the true
<br>
count is +5. You should know better than to hit a 16 against a dealer's 10
<br>
when the true count is greater than 0! Would you like to take that back and
<br>
try again?&quot; My game had no use for the keyboard -- it could be played
<br>
entirely with a microphone. Lotsa' fun. :)
