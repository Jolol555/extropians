Suppose you are a benevolent dictator and you just obtained intelligence
<br>
that suggest a particular person may be planning a suicide attack. You
<br>
believe that the intelligence is correct with probability p, and if so
<br>
there is a probability q that the attack will succeed and kill an expected
<br>
N people. So the expected number of dead people if you do nothing is
<br>
pqN.
<br>
<p>How high do p, q, and N have to be before you decide to arrest the 
<br>
person? Assuming you are a utilitarian, the answer is probably something 
<br>
like &quot;if pqN &gt; C&quot;, where C is the cost of arresting an innocent person 
<br>
divided by the cost of a death.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, most governments are not benevolent dictatorships, so this
<br>
answer doesn't work for them. The main problem is that if N is very large,
<br>
the rule says to arrest the suspected terrorist even if p is small, which
<br>
makes the system easy to abuse. Those in power can falsely accuse their
<br>
enemies of terrorism knowing that it's virtually impossible for a
<br>
defendant to establish with certainty that he is innocent.
<br>
<p>The rule that ends up being applied in practice is &quot;if p &gt; r&quot; where r is
<br>
some constant on the order of 1, which is obviously highly suboptimal, 
<br>
especially in cases where N is large.
<br>
<p>Here's where Robin Hanson's futarchy idea (see his post earlier today)
<br>
comes in. Establish betting markets, three for each person, on whether
<br>
that person will attempt an attack, whether he will succeed, and how many
<br>
casualties the attack will cause. Then apply a rule based on the asset
<br>
prices in these markets. Assuming that these markets cannot be easily
<br>
manipulated, this should be a much more efficient way to deal with
<br>
terrorism.
