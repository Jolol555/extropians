Matt Ridley author of the Red Queen has written a book Nature
<br>
via Nurture and in today's version of Time there's an interesting
<br>
&quot;teaser&quot; article. The science may be light but I liked it.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030602/story.html">http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030602/story.html</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Only now is it dawning on scientists .... that learning itself
<br>
consists of nothing more than switching genes on and off &quot;
<br>
......
<br>
<p>&quot;To make grand changes in the body plan of animals, there
<br>
&nbsp;is no need to invent new genes, just as there's no need to
<br>
&nbsp;invent new words to write an original novel (unless your
<br>
name is Joyce). All you need do is switch the same ones
<br>
on and off in different patterns. Suddenly, here is a
<br>
mechanism for creating large and small evolutionary changes
<br>
from small genetic differences. Merely by adjusting the
<br>
sequence of a promoter or adding a new one, you could
<br>
alter the expression of a gene.
<br>
<p>In one sense, this is a bit depressing. It means that until
<br>
scientists know how to find gene promoters in the vast text
<br>
of the genome, they will not learn how the recipe for a
<br>
chimpanzee differs from that for a person. But in another
<br>
sense, it is also uplifting, for it reminds us more forcefully
<br>
than ever of a simple truth that is all too often forgotten:
<br>
bodies are not made, they grow. The genome is not a
<br>
blueprint for constructing a body. It is a recipe for baking
<br>
a body. You could say the chicken embryo is marinated
<br>
for a shorter time in the HoxC8 sauce than the mouse
<br>
embryo is. Likewise, the development of a certain human
<br>
behavior takes a certain time and occurs in a certain order,
<br>
just as the cooking of a perfect soufflé requires not just
<br>
the right ingredients but also the right amount of cooking
<br>
and the right order of events.
<br>
<p>How does this new view of genes alter our understanding
<br>
of human nature? Take a look at four examples &quot;
