Thoughts on the following article&quot;
<br>
1) I wonder if, the description of our local portion of the galaxy means 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that such technologies as mag sails, and the like; will become the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transportation of choice as sails react with ionized interstellar gas?
<br>
<p>2) Does having a &quot;swiss-cheese&quot; galaxy promote or hinder the  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development of other intelligent species. or neither?
<br>
<p>3) Would large regions of ionized interstellar gas, affect the propagation or 
<br>
detection of radio signals? If so, this would explain Fermi's paradox?

3-D Map Of Local Space Shows Sun Lies In Middle Of Hole Piercing Galactic 
<br>
Plane
<br>
Berkeley -- The first detailed map of space within about 1,000 light years of 
<br>
Earth places the solar system in the middle of a large hole that pierces the 
<br>
plane of the galaxy, perhaps left by an exploding star one or two million 
<br>
years ago. The new map, produced by University of California, Berkeley, and French 
<br>
astronomers, alters the reigning view of the solar neighborhood. In that 
<br>
picture, the sun lies in the middle of a hot bubble -- a region of million-degree 
<br>
hydrogen gas with 100-1,000 times fewer hydrogen atoms than the average gas 
<br>
density in the Milky Way -- and is surrounded by a solid wall of colder, denser 
<br>
gas. 
<br>
<p>Instead, said astronomer Barry Welsh of UC Berkeley's Space Sciences 
<br>
Laboratory, the region around the sun is an irregular cavity of low-density gas that 
<br>
has tunnels branching off through the surrounding dense gas wall. Welsh and his 
<br>
French colleagues suspect that the interconnecting cavities and tunnels, 
<br>
analogous to the holes in a sponge, were created by supernovas or very strong 
<br>
stellar winds that swept out large regions and, when they encountered one another, 
<br>
merged into passageways. 
<br>
<p>&quot;When we started mapping gas in the galaxy, we found a deficit of neutral gas 
<br>
within about 500 light years, suggesting that we are in a bubble-shaped 
<br>
cavity perhaps filled with hot, ionized gas,&quot; Welsh said. &quot;But the Local Bubble is 
<br>
shaped more like a tube and should be called the Local Chimney.&quot; 
<br>
<p>If this system of interlocking, gaseous cavities is characteristic of the 
<br>
entire galaxy, it presents a dramatic confirmation of a 30-year-old theory of the 
<br>
Milky Way, Welsh said. 
<br>
<p>Welsh is presenting the findings on Thursday, May 29, at the American 
<br>
Astronomical Society meeting in Nashville, Tenn. 
<br>
<p>At the moment, the origin of the cavities is anybody's guess, Welsh said. The 
<br>
local cavity has been around for a few million years and could easily have 
<br>
been caused by a supernova punching through the top and bottom of the galactic 
<br>
disk, the intense stellar winds from 10 or so hot stars, a powerful gamma-ray 
<br>
burst, or even a large star moving through the area. Each of these could 
<br>
theoretically sweep dense gas out of the region, leaving only tenuous, ionized 
<br>
hydrogen. 
<br>
<p>Three recently developed satellites could shed light on the mystery. The 
<br>
Cosmic Hot Interstellar Plasma Spectrometer (CHIPS) satellite, built at UC 
<br>
Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory, was launched last December to look for hot, 
<br>
500,000-degree Celsius gas near our solar system. The UC Berkeley-built SPEAR 
<br>
(Spectroscopy of Plasma Evolution from Astrophysical Radiation) instrument, to be 
<br>
launched later this year as the primary payload of the Korean KAISTSAT-4 
<br>
satellite mission, will detect the presence of warm gas -- about 250,000 degrees 
<br>
Celsius -- in the solar neighborhood. NASA's Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic 
<br>
Explorer (FUSE) satellite is also currently searching for this hot gas. 
<br>
<p>With only ground-based telescopes at their disposal, Welsh and his colleagues 
<br>
could not look directly for cold neutral hydrogen (H), since the density is 
<br>
about 10 times too low for radio telescopes to detect. Instead, they looked for 
<br>
a surrogate -- cold neutral sodium, which is found wherever cold, dense 
<br>
hydrogen is found. Using five separate telescopes, they searched for the cavity 
<br>
walls where the density of cold neutral sodium becomes high enough to detect. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We used several ground-based telescopes, including the Observatoire de Haute 
<br>
Provence in France, the European Southern Observatory in Chile and the Lick 
<br>
Observatory in California, to detect atoms of gas in interstellar space towards 
<br>
over a 1,000 nearby stars,&quot; said Dr. Rosine Lallement, the project leader at 
<br>
the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Paris. &quot;In 
<br>
collaboration with Dr. Barry Welsh at UC Berkeley, this project has taken over five 
<br>
years to accumulate and analyze all the data.&quot; 
<br>
<p>A key factor in mapping the local interstellar space was recent data from the 
<br>
European Hipparcos satellite, which has provided highly accurate distances to 
<br>
nearby stars, improving significantly over distances obtained through 
<br>
ground-based measurement of parallax. 
<br>
<p>By locating stars that showed no absorption by sodium and those that did, 
<br>
they were able to construct a three-dimensional picture of the edge of the 
<br>
low-density region surrounding our solar system. The 1,005 stars they looked at were 
<br>
all hot, blue Type A and B stars, because it's easier to pick out sodium 
<br>
absorption lines from their spectra. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Eventually, our measurements towards more distant stars started to pick up 
<br>
large numbers of sodium atoms, indicating that we had stumbled across a dense 
<br>
neutral-gas boundary, or 'wall,' to our local cavity,&quot; Welsh said. The nearest 
<br>
wall is 175-190 light years from Earth, in the direction of the center of our 
<br>
galaxy. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This thin shell of dense gas surrounding the local void is broken in many 
<br>
places,&quot; said Dr. Francoise Crifo, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory. &quot;In 
<br>
several directions in the galaxy, our local cavity seems to be linked with 
<br>
other similar empty regions by pathways or tunnels in the interstellar medium.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The existence of a network of tunnels of hot gas that thread interstellar 
<br>
space was first suggested nearly 30 years ago by Don Cox and Barry Smith of the 
<br>
University of Wisconsin. In their model, energetic galactic supernova 
<br>
explosions create fast-moving expanding bubbles of hot gas that collide with the 
<br>
surrounding cold gas of interstellar space, which in turn becomes compressed into 
<br>
thin shells. Eventually, these shells of cold gas meet other expanding hot 
<br>
cavities and break up to form small tunnels or pathways between the expanding 
<br>
voids, Welsh said. 
<br>
<p>&quot;If you look at the new map of cold, local interstellar gas in the galactic 
<br>
plane, you see an inner empty region with finger-like extensions or tunnels 
<br>
that poke through the surrounding wall and reach into nearby regions of our 
<br>
galaxy, such as the Lupus-Norma, Auriga-Perseus and Scorpius-Centaurus associations 
<br>
of young stars,&quot; he said. &quot;These regions are known to contain large amounts 
<br>
of hot and ionized low-density gas that can be detected at radio and 
<br>
ultraviolet wavelengths.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The new results also show that the local void of gas extends out of the 
<br>
galactic disk and stretches into the overlying galactic halo region. In this view 
<br>
of the galaxy, the cavity appears as a tube-like &quot;chimney&quot; that links the gas 
<br>
in the galactic disk with that of the halo. Galactic chimneys have been widely 
<br>
observed in other galaxies and are thought to be responsible for venting the 
<br>
hot and ionized gas expelled in supernova explosions into galaxy halos. Active 
<br>
vents seen in other galaxies have been labeled &quot;galactic fountains&quot; and the 
<br>
gas falling back into the disk, &quot;galactic rain.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;We have been searching for signs of hot gas in this local chimney using the 
<br>
NASA FUSE satellite, and so far, we have found tentative signs of hot gas that 
<br>
seems to be coming towards us, which could be part of a fountain that is 
<br>
falling back onto the galactic plane,&quot; Welsh said. 
<br>
<p>The results of the research are soon to be published in the journal Astronomy 
<br>
and Astrophysics, along with a 3-D map of the distribution of cold sodium gas 
<br>
out to 1,000 light years. Lallement noted, however, that the project is not 
<br>
yet complete. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We also have information on the motion of the atoms of sodium gas we have 
<br>
detected along the 1,005 sight-lines,&quot; she said. &quot;Soon we will be able to say 
<br>
whether the gas wall that surrounds our local void is coming towards the sun and 
<br>
squeezing our local interstellar space, or whether it is moving away from us 
<br>
such that the local void is getting larger.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;Either of these scenarios is fascinating,&quot; Welsh said. &quot;If the wall is 
<br>
approaching us, it means that a distant explosive force is pushing it towards us. 
<br>
If it is expanding away from the sun, then it seems possible that a supernova 
<br>
explosion took place about a million years ago that was located relatively 
<br>
close to our sun.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Other colleagues are Daphne Sfeir, who published a preliminary map in 1999 
<br>
using 350 stars, and J. L. Vergely of ACRI, a high-tech company based in 
<br>
Sofia-Antipolis, France. The group used data from two other telescopes -- the Kitt 
<br>
Peak telescope in Arizona and the recently destroyed Mt. Stromlo telescope in 
<br>
Australia. 
<br>
<p>The research was supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
<br>
contract with the Johns Hopkins University
