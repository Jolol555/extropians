<p>Hard to tell, most public figures are in favor of the drug laws.  There are
<br>
conservative exceptions: Willian Buckley, George Schulz, maybe John
<br>
McLaughlin.  And if you believe conservative, well, constitutionalist
<br>
rhetoric, Congress has no Constitutional authority to ban drug use.  *shrug*

<p>More than one axis, remember?

<p>Somewhat, yeah.  I'm a bit influenced by Ken MacLeod's novels, where
<br>
free-market communists (don't ask) are the good guys, Greens are gray like
<br>
most everyone else, and animal-rights activists get less sympathy than the
<br>
AIs, who get genocided repeatedly.  On Usenet MacLeod has emphasized the
<br>
humanist core of socialism, the ideas of technology and progress to serve
<br>
humans.
<br>
<p>Of course the fiction of MacLeod and Banks isn't very weapon-averse; they may
<br>
be exceptional.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; The root of environmentalism isn't about preventing change, although I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sure that's around too now, but about preventing damage.  Or conserving

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm either not following you or I disagree.  As for preventing
</em><br>
<p>The historical roots of environmentalism are about not poisoning our ecosystem
<br>
and about not making valuable or interesting species extinct.  About
<br>
preventing damage.  Think _Silent Spring_.  Yes, there's a Gaia-worshipping
<br>
strand around these days too, and it can be vocal, but it's a mistake to focus
<br>
too much on it.  For me environmentalism is about whether I can see mountains
<br>
which are six miles away.  (In Pasadena you often can't, due to smog.)  Clean
<br>
air, clean water.  Not fouling our cage like rats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; change, I've known nature lovers who would hate a desert area
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to become forested &quot;because all the desert life would die&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (showing that the increase in total life didn't appeal that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much to them).  
</em><br>
<p>Desert life has appeal of its own.  There're value in diversity, in avoiding
<br>
monocultures.  Deserts are rarely dead, although some may be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is &quot;ecological capital&quot;, in economic terms?
</em><br>
<p>The economic services provided by nature, like oxygen, or regulating floods.
<br>
Or the cost of replacing those services with technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sure---you can characterize it in terms of &quot;damage&quot; --- but then
</em><br>
<p>And how would you characterize acid rain, or loss of life due to smog, or
<br>
having to avoid eating too much otherwise-healthy fish because of mercury
<br>
buildup, or loss of life or having to be more careful outside because of ozone
<br>
layer damage and increse in skin cancer?
