<p><em>&gt; Dan (Technotranscendence) [quoted],
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Abstract: I look for explanations for the phenomenon of widespread,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strong, and persistent disagreements about political issues. The best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explanation is provided by the hypothesis that most people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; irrational about politics and not, for example, that political issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are particularly difficult or that we lack sufficient evidence for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resolving them. I discuss how this irrationality works and why people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are especially irrational about politics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For the full essay, see <a href="http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/irrationality.htm">http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/irrationality.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very interesting and well thought-out article.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I disagree with [Michael Huemer's] &quot;problem&quot; of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clustering of political beliefs.  He seems to explain that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unrelated beliefs are group together in an irrational way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but this is hard to prove.  I submit that there is a rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (although not necessarily accurate) reason for these groupings.
</em><br>
<p>I also agree, but must apologize to John Clark for perhaps
<br>
understating the difficulty in explaining them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, under &quot;correlations of political beliefs with non-cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traits&quot;, you state that &quot;Members of minorities are much more likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support affirmative action than white men are. The poor are much more likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the rich to believe in wealth-redistribution (welfare, etc.) Members of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the entertainment industry are much more likely to be liberal than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative.  None of these trends would be expected if political beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had a solely, or even primarily, cognitive origin.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I submit that these are all rational, selfish, self-preservation traits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All of these groups are selfishly arguing for political views that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit their own particular group.  This seems perfectly rational and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent to me.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but Michael Huemer said that.  Under section 5, he has a section
<br>
devoted to &quot;Self-interested bias&quot;.  I didn't have a problem with what
<br>
he wrote there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another example cited, &quot;one would naively expect that those who support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal rights would be far more likely to oppose abortion than those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reject the notion of animal rights.&quot;  This is only true for super-rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atheists.  For God-fearing Christians who take the Bible literally, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both are explained by the religious belief in a soul.  Animals don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; souls, so they don't get any rights.  A fetus gets a soul at conception and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore has rights.  This seems perfectly rational and consistent to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within the religious belief system of Christianity.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The discussion on &quot;Rational Ignorance&quot; seems to hit the nail on the head
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for me.  People don't bother investigating possibilities that might work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against them.  They support causes that will benefit their group.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppose causes that will not benefit their group.  They work hard finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information to support their positions.  They do not work hard finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information that refutes their position.  This seems to be the root cause of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all politics.  People selfishly choose what they want to believe, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only pay attention to data that supports their goals.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but I have some criticism of Huemer's points, and my criticism
<br>
possibly applies to what you have written here.  See further on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All of your reasons stated under &quot;Sources of Belief Preferences&quot; seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct to me.  I just don't see what any of that has to do with being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational.  People are selfish and choose ideas for their own purposes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than what is actually true.  This seems to me to be a consistent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational strategy.  But it is a political strategy for gaining more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources, not for discerning truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In summary, I don't disagree with your paper.  However, I think it more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly boils down to people's motives.  If they want to be selfish,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compete and get more for themselves, the common political bickering seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the way to do it.  If they want to be scientific, logical, and seek out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth, then this seems incompatible with politics.
</em><br>
<p>On the whole I agree, except for the last sentence.  There really is a
<br>
truth to most political matters (this perhaps is or is not what you 
<br>
meant), e.g., either the CIA and the United Fruit Company overthrew
<br>
democracy in Honduras or they didn't, and the North Vietnamese either
<br>
did or did not kill more civilians than did the Americans.  Now, beyond
<br>
that---e.g., severe monetary inequality among citizens of a democracy
<br>
is harmful---well, science and logic aren't going to be enough for that.
<br>
I stubbornly hold out that the author is wrong in part, and that values
<br>
are crucial to much of political disagreement.
<br>
<p>More in another post.

<p>Lee
