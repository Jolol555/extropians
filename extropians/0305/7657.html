Lee Corbin:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In my opinion the distrust is not anti-American. It is the distrust of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the disenfranchised and the disempowered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps a better solution would be to enfranchise the rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world.  As the U.S. is the world's pre-eminent military power,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why shouldn't everyone have an equal say in what is done with it?
</em><br>
<p>I think your being ironic. How? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can you think of a logical reason why someone living, say, south
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an imaginary line in the American west should not be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vote, while someone living just a little bit to the north of it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can vote?
</em><br>
<p>Not a &quot;logical&quot; one. I guess I see it as essentially an historical
<br>
accident. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is the same sort of sentiment that caused an earlier generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of Americans to go to war to assert their rights not to be taxed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (governed) without being represented. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly.  Just because they don't happen to be living in North
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America, why shouldn't a peasant in China or some extremely poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person in sub-Saharan Africa have an equal say?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; So the solution may just be for the U.S. to take over the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hold on: this is not as evil as it sounds; after all, the peasant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in China and the starving man in Africa would *not* have to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any taxes to support that military: they aren't rich enough, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fall below the poverty line.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't sound &quot;evil&quot; to me. Just, unfortunately, unrealistic. More 
<br>
than military might is needed. I don't think American's want to feel
<br>
themselves merely to be the latest iteration of Rome, Greece, Egypt
<br>
or earlier military powers. I don't think they want to settle for a life
<br>
within fortress America either. Civilization, good quality of life, I 
<br>
think, mean more than that to Americans too. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not only that, but they'd be entitled to their fair share of the pie,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a safety net  provided by the (taxed) richer regions, like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S., Australia, and Europe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then they wouldn't be either disenfranchised nor powerless,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and their *feelings* would be so assuaged.
</em><br>
<p>Do you think? I doubt it. *Feelings* of injustice are unlikely to be 
<br>
replaced by any scheme I can think of. But the intensity of the feelings,
<br>
that I think, is something we (humanity including humanity's American
<br>
representatives especially as they are empowered) can maybe do
<br>
something about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Personally I would have preferred President Bush to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; revoked the Charter before invading Iraq. In the long term 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perhaps that would have harmed the US reputation less (the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US government reputation).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have to understand that there are two kinds of reputation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved here, Brett.  One is the highly ephemeral dismissal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the United States that one is likely to hear at a European
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cocktail party or academic gathering (&quot;barbarians&quot;, &quot;hmmpt&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;insufferable&quot;), and the other is the real fear inspired in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hearts of terrorists and others who think about taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action against the West.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to be completely ignoring the latter.  If enough people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the West were like you, then they'd elect a lot of leaders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who would actually cause the ruffians of the world to despise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. *more*. 
</em><br>
<p>I think you have miss-categorised me. I'm for the rule of law because
<br>
its part of the civilizing process. If the laws are wrong I'm for 
<br>
changing them. If the treaties are not being honored - revoke them.
<br>
<p>What I am not for is breaking laws and treaties and then denying that
<br>
they were broken and expecting the rest of the world to go along
<br>
with the fascade.  It gets real hard to tell the good guys from the bad
<br>
guys when the so called good guys act like that.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I think that the trouble with the U.S. leaving the U.N.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; would be that it would play right into the hands of America's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; enemies. &quot;See! They're so out of control that they won't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; talk anymore!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think the problem is worse than that now Lee.  It's not that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US government won't talk that I think people outside of the states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fear, it is that they can't be trusted when they do.  It's that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the US signature on a treaty may not be worth anything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How ironic that North Korea now wants a non-aggression pact with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. Explain that!
</em><br>
<p>Easy they are scared and desparate. Having a non-aggression treaty 
<br>
would be better than nothing. Any sort of normalisation of relations 
<br>
with the US is to be pursued as that will make it politically harder
<br>
for the US to take aggressive action. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think this perception is now widespread amongst many of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; citizens of the developed countries of the West. I don't trust the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US government or the Australian government). I am sure many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent US citizens  don't trust it either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is important is whether you can trust the U.S. to come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down hard on malefactors like Saddam Hussein;  believe me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when all is said and done, it's actions like that, not a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of words, that matter.
</em><br>
<p>But is it really? Let's say for argument sake that the same Presidential
<br>
administration takes a dislike to you for some reason. You don't have
<br>
Saddam's reputation. But what protects you from the extravagances
<br>
of government are the laws. If the US Government is above the law
<br>
in one set of circumstances how hard would it be to deprive you
<br>
of your constitutional rights?  And us non-US cits don't even have
<br>
those rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet there comes a time when, whether it's trade negotiations or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; human rights issues, Americans should indeed worry about what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; rest of the world will do.  Allowing the French and Russians to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; set the standard for human rights, or allowing a lot of America-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; haters to weaken international trade is not in anyone's real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; interest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No one nation can set the standards to the satisfaction of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nationals of a majority of other nations. This is not essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an American problem. It's a representation problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I proposed a solution for that.
</em><br>
<p>I think you tried. Its a tough problem though. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Without the UN any single powerful country disenfranchises the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; citizens of the other countries.  That is not a formula for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stability or dare I say &quot;extropy&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it's *stability* you are after, things are much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stable now than ever before.  One country practically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never invades another anymore, and when a major country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as the U.S. does, it's after years and years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negotiation and indecisiveness.
</em><br>
<p>Not in terms of international law. I don't think it was acceptable
<br>
to allow Iraq (or any other country to defy the UN or whatever
<br>
institution is duly authorised to act in the name of international 
<br>
peace and security for as long as it did). That does reduce
<br>
the notion of collective security to a farce. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; P.S. Several paragraphs in the above were completely ironical.
</em><br>
<p>I thought so. But I wasn't sure which ones.
<br>
<p>Brett
