<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Adrian Perrig, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon and Yaar's 
<br>
adviser, said that analyses based on large network simulations of Yaar’s 
<br>
proposal are promising. &quot;In the case that the (Internet) address is spoofed, 
<br>
our method wins hands down,&quot; he said. 
<br>
<p>The path-identifier number is stored in a part of network data packets that 
<br>
is largely unused: the 16-bit Internet Protocol (IP) identification field. 
<br>
The identifier is used only when network data has been fragmented, which 
<br>
occurs in less than 10 percent of cases, said Perrig. 
<br>
<p>One strength of the proposal is its ability to work even when only a fraction 
<br>
of ISPs--30 percent or more--have adopted the proposal. Moreover, the 
<br>
proposal shifts the onus for fixing Internet security problems from the 
<br>
victim to the attacker's ISP because such attacks result in traffic from 
<br>
parts of the Internet close to the attacker being blocked by the victim’s 
<br>
server. 
<br>
<p>AT&amp;T's Bellovin said those two results are what he likes about the plan. &quot;But 
<br>
I'm worried about something that doesn't work well with fragmentation,&quot; he 
<br>
said, pointing out that many digital subscriber line (DSL) providers used a 
<br>
technique for network data that increases fragmentation. Such subscribers 
<br>
could find their Internet connection nearly useless during an attack, if 
<br>
Yaar's proposal became widely used. &gt;&gt;
