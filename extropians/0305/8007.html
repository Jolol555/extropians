<p>You must be joking.  Checks and balances?  Reporting?  Have you ever been 
<br>
reported on?  They make up anything they damn well please.  Fact checking 
<br>
by editors?  A joke.  Amateurs lie for reasons.  Reporters lie to make 
<br>
their five column inches for the day.
<br>
<p>Read this article carefully.  What is astonishing is not that this person 
<br>
lied, but that his lies grew to the point where even the newspaper he was 
<br>
working for had to take notice.  Consider just how large those lies had to 
<br>
be, and how many of them had to accumulate, before the newspaper could no 
<br>
longer ignore them, as is usual.  That is the real picture of reporting.
