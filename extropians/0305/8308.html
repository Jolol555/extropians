<br>
<p>Hello all,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the Matrix thread begin! And if anyone can make a pun 
<br>
with this movie, please don't. Unless it involves reduced 
<br>
row echelon form--that I'd like to read.
<br>
<p>First, some SPOILER space for those who haven't seen it. 
<br>
Scroll down now or press delete.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>Still here?
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>MINOR SPOILERS:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The character &quot;Agent Smith&quot; has changed into &quot;Smith.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neo has super-powers: flight, speed, clairvoyance, 
<br>
desolidification, and raising of the dead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith has super-powers: duplication, uploading into human 
<br>
minds
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partial nudity
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p>MAIN SPOILERS: (This will ruin the movie.)
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machines have seen messiahs and refuges (Zion) come 
<br>
and go five times before.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Matrix probably exists as a set of nested 
<br>
simulations.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
DISCLAIMER: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't like the first movie. In fact, it's one of the 
<br>
very few movies where I left before it ended.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This biases my opinion.
<br>
<p>PLUSES:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrie-Ann Moss!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freeway chase scene. I've had two car accidents; some 
<br>
of the crashes evoked unpleasant memories. They looked 
<br>
quite real.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One really excellent line about the pleasures of swearing 
<br>
in French.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrie-Ann Moss in a glossy black vinyl bodysuit! (Could 
<br>
be tighter, but I guess she needs to breathe.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dynamic characters, even the scrubs know new tricks since 
<br>
the last movie 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic control at Zion has a lovely user interface. Not 
<br>
good augmented reality, but it appeals to me.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrie-Ann Moss!
<br>
<p><p>MINUSES:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wire-Fu choreography of inconsistent quality (freeway 
<br>
fight vs. staircase fight) Am I the only one tired of it?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gratuitous skin; Neo and Trinity are lovers. Great. The 
<br>
audience doesn't need to see it over and over cut with 
<br>
Standard Rave Scene Variant #51. Boring!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Predictable plot twists and dialogue; re-read the 
<br>
spoilers--do any really surprise you? If so, check your 
<br>
SL.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bullet time is played out. If you didn't think so before, 
<br>
you will afterwards.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of boring exposition from various characters. 
<br>
<p>SPECULATION:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easy one: all the characters exist as programs. Ever 
<br>
notice how Neo hasn't looked at another fighter with his 
<br>
&quot;code vision&quot;? Do they save this un-surprise for Matrix 3? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given five previous messiahs and five previous instances 
<br>
of Zion, and the likelihood of nested simulations, and the 
<br>
&quot;Human Resistance&quot; scenario's definite end state, is the 
<br>
Architect/Oracle breeding programs (the &quot;humans&quot;) in some 
<br>
kind of evolutionary competition? To what end?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of weird cults and bizaare little religions exist in 
<br>
Zion. The dionysiac town meeting with its weird opening 
<br>
prayer, makes me think that a good many weird philosophies 
<br>
exist there. I bet most of them glorify sensuality and 
<br>
&quot;direct, authentic experience&quot;. This would react against 
<br>
the synthetic matrix, and glorify the human body. The 
<br>
latter would help raise their reproductive rate. Sex isn't 
<br>
just fun, it's your holy duty!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zion-born humans probably form most of these cults. They 
<br>
might have no direct experience of the Matrix, and so 
<br>
might turn to their own oddball spirituality. It seems to 
<br>
me the various RW religions would have little appeal to 
<br>
them. After all, they know full well the machines can 
<br>
build worlds. Those rescued from the Matrix might or might 
<br>
not have a spiritual bent. Morpheus does, but seems to be 
<br>
an exception among the Zion military.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mortification of the flesh and an anti-technology bent 
<br>
seem to exist in Zion. They all dress in what amounts to 
<br>
sackcloth and ashes. Even a technophile like me might find 
<br>
it hard to love machinery if I lived in Zion. Despite 
<br>
having the tools and techniques to download skills into 
<br>
human minds, the Zionites live in squalor. A little 
<br>
Bulterian Jihad exists in their past.	
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neo = Christ; Morpheus = John the Baptist; Smith = 
<br>
Lucifer; Trinity = Mary Magdelene; Architect = God; Oracle 
<br>
= Virgin Mary; Operators (e.g., Link) = Holy Ghost; Heaven 
<br>
= ?; Hell = ?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As suggested on the exi-list in a previous Matrix thread, 
<br>
I bet you the Agents, the Keymaker, the Architect, the 
<br>
Oracle, the Seraph, and all the others aren't 
<br>
fundamentally part of the Matrix itself. Some of them, 
<br>
such as the Merovingian and perhaps Smith now, have grown 
<br>
independent. They carve out their own little kingdoms and 
<br>
realms within the greater matrix. Persephone particularly 
<br>
intrigues me. (I wonder what material made up her dress.) 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I'll bet she's a program grown from a 
<br>
human from the previous instance of Zion. (See also the 
<br>
RPGs Sorcerer &amp; Sword and Charnel Gods)
<br>
<p><p>IN A NUTSHELL
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All said and done, MR (Matrix Reloaded) sucked less than 
<br>
its predecessor. It still remained predictable, but it 
<br>
nicely resolved my main problem with the first movie. 
<br>
Namely, the tension in the storyline between Neo as 
<br>
freedom fighter and Neo as messiah. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I make clear how attractive I find Carrie-Ann Moss? 
<br>
;-)
