<em>&gt; Harvey,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I won't use the rest of your rant as this is sufficient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand your disappointment that the Army did not suffer a tragedy --
</em><br>
<p>You are falsely putting words in my mouth.  Please show me any posting that
<br>
implied I wanted the Army to suffer a tragedy, or even predicted that the
<br>
Army would suffer a tragedy.  I have never desired such an outcome and don't
<br>
know why you would imply that I would.  (Perhaps you are unaware of the many
<br>
years I have devoted in support of the military as a military
<br>
subcontractor.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; after having your personal political viewpoints shown to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faulty must be painful.
</em><br>
<p>What political views are you talking about?  Please quote previous posts
<br>
from me and explain where my viewpoints were shown to be faulty.  The only
<br>
thing I remember claiming is that we still haven't proven that there were
<br>
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  I think the jury is still out on that
<br>
one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        The reporters that wanted to fraternize did so.  Those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish to fraternize did not do so.  At least one story was filed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by a reporter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complaining about the large number of reporters that hung together, drank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together and turned in the Army's handouts.  Even while embedded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would not get out and do their job.  But he admitted that was a
</em><br>
minority.
<br>
<p>I'm not following you here at all.  Are you sure your comments are directed
<br>
at me?  This doesn't seem to relate to anything I have ever said.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        I suggest you quit trying to rewrite history.  Those of us that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followed the war remember clearly the negativity of the reporters in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early days of the war.  We were bogged down, we were in another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vietnam, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be months defeating the Iraqi Army, The Iraqis would blow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bridges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we would be forever even driving the distance to Baghdad.
</em><br>
<p>Please quote my exact postings.  I never made these claims.  You seem to
<br>
have my viewpoints confused with what you believe to be the typical Liberal.
<br>
The fact that you think I would deliberately want the Army to suffer a
<br>
tragedy shows that your view of Liberals comes from misrepresentation from
<br>
the Right.  It clearly has no relationship to anything I have ever said.  I
<br>
wish you would not misrepresent me in such a manner.  Again, I ask for
<br>
specific quotations from me espousing the hate you claim.  I believe your
<br>
own hate and vitriol are being projected onto others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, and our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supply lines were deficient leaving our soldiers in hunger,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thirst &amp; out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ammo while our vehicles lacked both ammo &amp; fuel.
</em><br>
<p>I never said this either.  Are you sure you sure you don't have me confused
<br>
with someone else?  You are attacking bizarre positions that I have not seen
<br>
presented on this list, and certainly not presented by me.  Any evidence to
<br>
the contrary would certainly be appreciated.
