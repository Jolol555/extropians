<p><em>&gt; What would be the side-effects of lectins?  What are the symptoms?
</em><br>
<p>In some cases the symptoms of lectin consumption include vomiting and
<br>
diarrhea, as I described with a case study in the thread titled &quot;paleo diet
<br>
criticisms&quot;. 
<br>
<p>I think however that this is the wrong line of thought. Noticeable medical
<br>
symptoms are evidence of existing disease -- they are not evidence of future
<br>
disease or reduced longevity. In general I leave the treatment of existing
<br>
diseases to medical doctors. My health goal is to *prevent* disease and its
<br>
associated symptoms with proper diet and health care. 
<br>
<p>As I've described in other messages, lectins from legumes and grains are
<br>
thought to cause or aggravate various diseases of the immune system.
<br>
Phytates from soy interfere with mineral absorption. Phytoestrogens from soy
<br>
are mild agonists of the estrogen receptor in men as well as women. These
<br>
are unnatural processes with implications for the future, regardless of
<br>
whether you notice the symptoms in the present.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, doesn't cooking destroy lectins?
</em><br>
<p>Not always, apparently. In the case study I posted in the aforementioned
<br>
thread, close to 50% of the employees experienced severe vomiting and
<br>
diarrhea simply because the red kidney beans they ate contained more than
<br>
the average level of lectins. The beans were cooked, but it seems they were
<br>
not cooked enough. Are you willing to guess the amount of cooking necessary
<br>
to protect yourself from the lectins in a given batch of beans? Personally I
<br>
would rather just not eat beans. 
<br>
<p>If I cannot in principle eat something raw then I think I should not eat it
<br>
in the first place. My ancestors did not cook foods until fairly recently on
<br>
the evolutionary time-scale. I inherited their genes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't eat eggs or cheese unless there is nothing else available when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am eating out, then I allow them rather than go hungry.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, well, anything is better than starvation. 
<br>
<p>Unfortunately however this is the reason the human diet came to include
<br>
strange non-paleo foods like grain and dairy and legumes to which we are not
<br>
genetically adapted. These foods help to prevent famine. Fortunately most
<br>
moderns like us have a choice not to include them.
