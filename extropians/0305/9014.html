<em>&gt;Spike just for idle ignoramuses like myself what is the basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(generally) for the interest in *really* big prime numbers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their discovery... 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm merely curious. Are there applications for this sort of thing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why Spike, Why?  Brett Paatsch
</em><br>
<p>The topic came up on the Mersenne Search chat group: Guys,
<br>
why the hell are we doing this?
<br>
<p>There were a number of responses, of which yours truly
<br>
won the grand prize for the most creative idea, this
<br>
prize being the heartfelt (if temporary) esteem of the
<br>
group.
<br>
<p>My notion is that a long list of Mersenne primes could
<br>
be used as a gentle deterrence or a weapon of peace for
<br>
any extraterrestrial civilizations we might contact.  If
<br>
we reveal our many resources, ET might be tempted to 
<br>
come here and devour same.  
<br>
<p>But if we transmit a long list of Mersenne primes, (the 
<br>
same in any base, in any corner of the universe) we 
<br>
demonstrate that not only are we a clever species, we have 
<br>
computer resources to simply waste on foolishness.  This 
<br>
could be easily extrapolated into our having a veritable 
<br>
firehose of technology.  One would be ill advised to give 
<br>
humanity a reason to turn that firehose upon one. 
<br>
(nice doggie, niiiice doggie, while backing away slowly.)
<br>
<p>There are other reasons, such as THE MONEY!  I could put
<br>
$100k to good use, couldn't you?  Why not, it's a (nearly)
<br>
free lottery ticket.  Furthermore, if you find one, you get 
<br>
your name on a short list for all time, along with such 
<br>
names as Euler, Pervushin, Woltman and Lucas.
<br>
<p>Every time the group finds a new prime, you get to attend a
<br>
way cool math party with such luminaries as Donald Knuth and
<br>
Ernst Mayer.  One must carefully rehearse not falling 
<br>
prostrate upon the earth before them, crying plaintively
<br>
&quot;Im so unworthy! I suck!&quot;  (They don't like it when you do
<br>
that in a crowded restaurant.)
<br>
<p>I have reconnected with a lot of local math geeks either
<br>
directly or indirectly thru GIMPS.
<br>
<p>Gregory Stock made a pitch at Extro4 about the effect
<br>
of cash prizes on research.  We now have a perfect study
<br>
case.  The EFF prize turned out to have little impact
<br>
that I can tell.  The introduction of the Pentium 4
<br>
had a large impact however.
<br>
<p>It is interesting to have a quantity that continues
<br>
to double in size every 11 seconds for years.  The size
<br>
of the record largest prime doubles every 11 seconds
<br>
on average for long stretches of time (~1 million
<br>
decimal digit prime discovered on 27 Jan 1997, 2+ million
<br>
digit prime discovered 1 June 1999, 4+ million digit
<br>
prime discovered 14 November 2001.  The doubling time
<br>
is actually getting shorter, as more people join GIMPS
<br>
and CPUs get dramatically faster.  Since we are currently
<br>
searching near the 6 million digit mark, the doubling time
<br>
is now under 10 seconds.  How many phenomena do you know 
<br>
that exhibit hyperexponential growth, continuously
<br>
over long periods?
<br>
<p>GIMPS reduces waste.  If your background computing
<br>
cycles are not being used by something, your computer
<br>
is sitting there 99.9% of the time saying&quot; whatdoIdo,
<br>
whatdoIdo, whatdoIdo... over and over.  If you buy a
<br>
newer machine, it asks whatdoIdo much faster.  We
<br>
should be WORKING those idle CPUs.    
<br>
<p>It pleases me to know my idle CPU cycles are being used
<br>
to advance science, even if in a kind of trivial way.
<br>
But not really *that* trivial.  We are making a map of
<br>
nature here, a universal map.  We don't know *for absolute
<br>
sure* that the abundance of primes continues to follow
<br>
logarithm rule for abundance.  How would we know if they
<br>
mysteriously began to thin out once one is way out in
<br>
the kilothousand digit primes, beyond our ability to determine
<br>
primeness?  Well, the Mersenne primes have that wonderful
<br>
shortcut to determine primeness, the Lucas Lehmer algorithm,
<br>
which allows a primality test to be done millions of
<br>
orders of magnitude more quickly than without it.  In what
<br>
other area do you know of that you can even logically
<br>
use the phrase &quot;millions of orders of magnitude&quot; without
<br>
any exaggeration at all? 
<br>
<p>Mersenne Primes can be used to determine if your CPU is 
<br>
running at the advertised speed, and with accuracy.  The 
<br>
GIMPS software logs whenever your computer drops a bit and 
<br>
causes a checksum error.  These checksums are performed 
<br>
every couple hours or so.  This way, if you get a checksum
<br>
that implies an error, the algorithm loses only a small
<br>
amount of processor time, going back to the last time
<br>
a reasonable checksum was found.
<br>
<p>Heres the final thought.  My friend Scott Kurowski 
<br>
volunteered his company's services (irony: it is called
<br>
Entropia.com) to organize GIMPS.  One would have to know 
<br>
Scott.  He is the kind of guy who has money magnetism.  
<br>
If he walks thru a room, currency seems to chase him, 
<br>
struggling to get into his pocket.  A generous person is 
<br>
he: at the last Mersenne party, he showed up and picked 
<br>
up the bill.  There were 14 of us present.
<br>
<p>One wonders why Scott, the ultimate businessman, would
<br>
spend money in this way.  Then it occurred to me that
<br>
GIMPS has generated a database of enormous value.  Computers
<br>
dont make mistakes often, but they do make mistakes, and
<br>
the designs have bugs, such as the famous Pentium bug.  GIMPS
<br>
has been quietly collecting data for several years now on
<br>
every kind of processor and every kind of operating system
<br>
that is in the world today.  When your processor makes a
<br>
bad checksum, the result is logged.  Scott can tell you
<br>
what processor is best, Intel, AMD or Motorola.  He can
<br>
tell you if any particular operating system correlates 
<br>
with more checksum errors.  He can tell you which
<br>
combinations of processor and operating system works
<br>
best.  
<br>
<p>How much do you think this data is worth?  To Intel?  AMD?
<br>
Motorola?  How about HP, Dell, Micron and Gateway?
<br>
<p>Ive been meaning to ask Scott if he planned all along
<br>
to gather this database, or if it was just a fortunate
<br>
accident, an unintended byproduct.  What do you think? 
<br>
<p>But for me, the biggest reward is being mentioned by the
<br>
highly esteemed Australian science writer Dr. Damien
<br>
Broderick, in his most intriguing and extropic book about 
<br>
the future, The Spike, on page 87.  
<br>
<p>Of course, if I win the 100 kiloclams, that would surpass
<br>
the book thing as the biggest reward, but still the cite 
<br>
is way cool.
