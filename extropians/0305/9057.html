<p>Oh, books could probably be written about this.  But
<br>
as Mez could comment (he is more up-to-date on this than
<br>
I) we have already seen lifespan extensions based on
<br>
the careful engineering (in Drosophila and mice at least)
<br>
for modified gene complexes based on creative combinations
<br>
of the &quot;regulon&quot;, the &quot;directithon&quot; and the &quot;actithon&quot;.
<br>
<p>The regulon saying &quot;when to act&quot;, the &quot;directithon&quot;
<br>
(in biological terms the &quot;signal sequence&quot;) saying
<br>
&quot;where to act&quot; and the &quot;actithon&quot; (the actual protein)
<br>
saying &quot;what to do&quot;.
<br>
<p>Fundamental aspects of aging could be altered by knowing
<br>
&quot;when to act&quot; (e.g. one doesn't want ones best defenses
<br>
to cancer or aging to be activated after one has cancer
<br>
or becomes aged -- one wants them activated before one
<br>
develops cancer or becomes aged).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, this is true if we can use yeast for pharmacological production,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food  production.
</em><br>
<p>Well the last time I checked yeast were being used for the production
<br>
of some chemicals and/or pharmaceuticals.  And I think we have been
<br>
using them for a very long time to produce bread and beer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and maybe fuel production.
</em><br>
<p>A better base for this is bacteria, not yeast -- they replicate much
<br>
faster (down to 20 min per replication cycle) and some have photosynthetic
<br>
capabilities -- so they can use solar energy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can we also learn to use regulons for human tissue engineering?
</em><br>
<p>That was perhaps part of my point that I didn't make clear enough --
<br>
the timing of the cell cycle is very carefully regulated, in part
<br>
by some of the &quot;regulons&quot;.  Fully understanding the regulons allows
<br>
us to &quot;tweek&quot; them to make the cell cycle go faster -- or make the
<br>
cellular reproduction process be more reliable.  Net results are
<br>
the ability to grow organs faster and a decreased proability that
<br>
normal cells turn into cancerous cells.
<br>
<p>We really need to get the mammalian regulon -- but its perhaps
<br>
only 3-5 times more complex than yeast.  Doable in 3-5 years,
<br>
perhaps less.
<br>
