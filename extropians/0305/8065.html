<p><em>&gt; So what's more important? Dietary content of glycotoxins, or

<em>&gt; glycotoxin-promoting substances? Is it possible to come up with a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; insulin levels low?
</em><br>
<p>My answer to the last is of course a strict paleolithic diet (as if you
<br>
didn't already know.:-) Meats are never cooked over an open flame. Instead
<br>
they are broiled or boiled or cooked slowly over low heat with plenty of
<br>
moisture and/or oils, keeping the formation of Advanced Glycation
<br>
End-Products (AGE's) to a minimum. (LEF now calls AGE's &quot;glycotoxins&quot; but I
<br>
will continue to call them AGE's as I always have.)
<br>
<p>Glucose and insulin are kept in check by eliminating non-paleolithic grains.
<br>
All grain products are high-glycemic index foods. In fact the glycemic value
<br>
of white bread is often used as the standard on the glycemic index against
<br>
which other foods measured, equaling 100 on a scale of 0 to 100. It is
<br>
roughly as glycemic as table sugar.
<br>
<p>I have a close friend who injects insulin for anti-aging purposes. He
<br>
injects a small amount of insulin with each meal to help keep his insulin
<br>
and blood glucose low, even though he is not diabetic.  He and I debate the
<br>
wisdom of this strategy constantly. In fact I visited him in Cancun in April
<br>
for a week (where we both own time-shares) and we spent almost the entire
<br>
week arguing about his theory about injecting insulin. :-) I am not yet
<br>
convinced that his idea is a good one for non-diabetics, but it's certainly
<br>
an interesting idea with a lot of potential. Insulin is very cheap and
<br>
available everywhere without a prescription. (Note to the casual reader:
<br>
don't try this at home without doing some research into proper dosages.
<br>
Insulin can be very dangerous if not used knowledgably.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Recent news says ACE inhibitor drugs help prevent glycotoxin formation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Metformin in a CR-mimic (potentially add 15 years to your life or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more... maybe). Anyone considering adding these into their health 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regimen? 
</em><br>
<p>Metformin (aka glucophage) has been part of my health regimen for years,
<br>
though I am not diabetic. I also take aminoguanidine and carnosine, both to
<br>
help prevent the formation of AGE's. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any doctors known to be proscribing them for these purposes?
</em><br>
<p>Another friend of mine, Ward Dean, M.D., is an internationally known
<br>
anti-aging doctor who recommends metformin to almost all his patients over
<br>
age 40, mainly for purposes of enhancing insulin sensitivity. Dr. Dean is a
<br>
regular participant in an online discussion group I manage called
<br>
&quot;Longevity.&quot; I do not know if he is aware of metformin's potential for
<br>
blocking AGE's. It was not until I received this month's copy of LEF
<br>
magazine that I even knew it had potential as an AGE inhibitor. My guess is
<br>
that it helps only indirectly, perhaps by helping to reduce blood glucose
<br>
and thus the glycation of hemoglobin.
