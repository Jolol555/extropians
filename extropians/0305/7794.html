<p>This kind of research looks sloppy to me.  Like some of the other
<br>
discussions I have seen, this seems to be based on older studies that lump
<br>
&quot;fats&quot; together, or don't distinguish between good and bad cholesterol.
<br>
<p>More problematically, this writer seems to think a good cholesterol &quot;ratio&quot;
<br>
means high HDL with no regard to what the LDL level is.  I think this author
<br>
misunderstood what the &quot;ratio&quot; was supposed to be a ratio of.  Instead of
<br>
increasing the ratio of HDL with respect to LDL (as I think should be done),
<br>
she seems to think that increasing the ratio means raising HDL or total
<br>
cholesterol without any mention of LDL.  I think this is a misunderstanding
<br>
on her part.
<br>
<p>So the real question is whether raising total cholesterol with saturated
<br>
fats is as good as raising HDL while lowering LDL.  She seems to think it
<br>
is.  She advocates deliberately eating more saturated fats to raise total
<br>
cholesterol (including HDL).  I agree that this would do it.  But my goal is
<br>
not to raise my total cholesterol.  My goal is to raise HDL and lower LDL so
<br>
that the ratio between them is raised.  This can be done, as she points out,
<br>
by eating more unsaturated fats and not saturated fats.  So it appears that
<br>
we agree in theory on the effects of different dietary fats on HDL and LDL
<br>
serum levels.  We disagree on the goals.  I, for one, do not want to raise
<br>
my total cholesterol without lowering my LDL.
<br>
<p>Specific points:
<br>
<p>Point 2 says &quot;HDL ratio has been proven to be a better standard to assess
<br>
cardiovascular risk.&quot;  But HDL isn't a ratio.  I think what she is
<br>
misunderstanding is that a high ratio between HDL and LDL is desired.  She
<br>
seems to assume that this ratio is simply high HDL.
<br>
<p>Point 2 goes on to say that &quot;all fats raise HDL&quot; as if this were a good
<br>
thing.  I submit that this &quot;ratio&quot; isn't improved unless LDLs are lowered at
<br>
the same time.
<br>
<p>In point 4 she seems to concede my understanding of fats.  Saturated fats
<br>
&quot;raise cholesterol&quot;, meaning total cholesterol.  Monounsaturated fat raises
<br>
HDL, but not total cholesterol (because it lowers LDL).  Polyunsaturated
<br>
fats do the same.  So her chemistry matches mine.  Saturated fats are good
<br>
if you want to raise total cholesterol.  Unsaturated fats are good if you
<br>
want to raise HDL and lower LDL.
<br>
<p>When she quotes studies that say raising cholesterol is good, she doesn't
<br>
seem to distinguish between different kinds of cholesterol.
<br>
<p>She also seems confused, and concedes in point 6 that studies are
<br>
inconsistent with regard to saturated fats and raising cholesterol.  I think
<br>
the problem is in her interpretation and failure to distinguish between
<br>
different types of cholesterol.
<br>
<p>In point 7 she dismisses all studies showing saturated fats as bad as being
<br>
contradictory, inconclusive and ambiguous.  It almost seems that she
<br>
concedes that there are many studies that contradict her claims, but she
<br>
rejects them all and selectively accepts only those that are consistent with
<br>
her beliefs.
<br>
<p>In point 8 she seems to assume that raising total cholesterol is not bad as
<br>
long as HDL is raised.  I think this is a misunderstanding that improving
<br>
the &quot;ratio&quot; would means lowering LDL while HDL is raised.  If both kinds of
<br>
cholesterol are raised, the ratio may not be improving.  I don't think she
<br>
knows what this &quot;ratio&quot; means.
<br>
<p>Then in point 8 she seems to imply that maybe saturated fats are bad,
<br>
because she argues that they are not eaten in isolation in meat, but are
<br>
combined with the monounsaturated fats which are good and would counteract
<br>
the effects of the saturated fats.  This seems to be inconsistent with her
<br>
other claims that saturated fats are good and maybe unsaturated fats are
<br>
bad.
