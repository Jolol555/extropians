<p>Interesting reference. According to
<br>
<a href="http://apc-online.com/twa/communications.shtml">http://apc-online.com/twa/communications.shtml</a> &quot;They used message
<br>
sticks carved with illustrations that reminded the carrier of the
<br>
content of the message, and showed the recipient that the message
<br>
was genuine. &quot; They seem to have acted both as a memory aid,
<br>
passport and authentification:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.culturelanguage.com.au/aborigines/signs_signals_and">http://www.culturelanguage.com.au/aborigines/signs_signals_and</a>

<br>
<p>&quot;Message sticks were also very commonly used between tribes. 
<br>
Every tribe had its messenger, whose life was held sacred by the
<br>
neighbouring tribe when in the performance of his duties, which
<br>
were the conveyance of messages from the tribe to its neighbours
<br>
concerning arrangements for places of meeting, either for fight
<br>
or corroboree. And most of these messengers would carry with them
<br>
message sticks-carved pieces of wood, flat or round, from four to
<br>
six inches long, an inch wide, and a third of an inch thick. The
<br>
edges of the flat stick carried by a messenger would be notched,
<br>
and the surface covered with indented lines or squares, and
<br>
coloured with red ochre. For a long time the whites thought that
<br>
the notches and carving themselves formed the message, but it was
<br>
subsequently discovered that the sticks were simply passports
<br>
ensuring the messenger's safety through territory perhaps of
<br>
hostile tribes across which he would have to pass before reaching
<br>
the tribes to whom he was carrying the message. The messenger
<br>
would generally carry the stick in his head-band, and kept note
<br>
of the time occupied by the journey by marking one of his arms
<br>
with a stripe of clay for each day, another man in the tribe also
<br>
keeping tally in a similar manner. On arriving at his
<br>
destination, the messenger would deliver his message to the most
<br>
important men of the tribe, who listened with great interest, and
<br>
ordered the women to supply the messenger with food, after which
<br>
he would return to the quarters occupied by the single men, and
<br>
silently await the answer to his message, upon receiving which he
<br>
would return.
<br>
<p>Messengers were sometimes sent to absent friends bearing a string
<br>
saturated with the blood of the sender, as an intimation to come
<br>
to him speedily.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fascinating. Doesn't seem to be writing, but an interesting
<br>
social system for message handling.
