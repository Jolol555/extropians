</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Daimond also points out that modern agricultural Greeks and Turks still have
<br>
not regained the stature they had in prehistoric times. 
<br>
<p>If calcium from dairy is so important to the diet then how is it that
<br>
prehistoric humans were taller and with stronger bones than moderns? Similar
<br>
results can be found in human remains here in N. America, where native
<br>
Americans switched from HG lifestyles to agricultural lifestyles. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But [Ag] did enable things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialization, trade, mass education, large-scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction, and everything else that got us a lot further
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;a lot further.&quot; If you mean &quot;closer to a
<br>
greater probability of imminent extinction due to environmental holocausts
<br>
of one kind of another&quot; then I certainly won't disagree. :) 
<br>
<p>This discussion is interesting because Diamond presents a view that is in
<br>
some ways opposite to extropianism. Extropianism is sympathetic to
<br>
progressivism and Diamond rejects progressivism. Forgive my blasphemy for
<br>
arguing his point of view.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And those first few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plagues killed off enough that those left (and we, their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descendents) are likely better adapted to the new lifestyle.
</em><br>
<p>True, but then those plague victims would likely not have lived in the first
<br>
place had we not developed agriculture and all social trappings that go
<br>
along with it. Plagues flourish only because we live in concentrated cities,
<br>
made possible by agriculture.
