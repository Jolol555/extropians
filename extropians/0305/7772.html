<p><em>&gt; What? What? Why should something have `set the peculiar initial conditions'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of *our* Universe? On this Poincare recurrence argument (well, it looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awfully familiar to me, anyway), ours might well be the remixed result of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many earlier *non*-us-like universes, surely? It's *not* special pleading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for me to note that I hold the views I do and speak English because by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happenstance I was born in Australia last century, rather than two thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago. The Copernican default assumption can be taken too far,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially when we're juggling universes.
</em><br>
<p>We discussed this paper a few months ago on Wei Dai's &quot;everything&quot; list.
<br>
Unfortunately the physics was over the heads of all of us so it was hard
<br>
to understand exactly what is going on.  I sent email to the authors
<br>
asking for clarification, but they didn't respond, no doubt assessing
<br>
my level of ignorance as being too deep for a quick answer.
<br>
<p>Damien is right that this is a variation of a very old argument, going
<br>
back to Boltzmann in the 19th century, relating to Poincare recurrence.
<br>
Suppose that the universe goes on forever in a steady, disordered state,
<br>
say as a uniform gas.  Then eventually, at random, some of that gas will
<br>
collect together in a locally low-entropy state, and it could collect
<br>
to form solid matter or even stars.  This would be extremely rare, but
<br>
it would happen eventually, and we're assuming that the steady state
<br>
lasts forever.  Then, with even enormously greater rarity, you could
<br>
get a much larger random fluctuation which could form whole galaxies, or
<br>
even billions of galaxies as we see.  Hence in a universe of this kind,
<br>
there would occasionally be observers like ourselves.
<br>
<p>The problem and paradox is that this is not a plausible explanation of
<br>
what we see (even ignoring Big Bang considerations), because it is so
<br>
much enormously less likely that you will get zillions of galaxies than
<br>
that you would get just a single star.  It's far more likely that the
<br>
bare minimum would happen that was sufficient to create life; something
<br>
like a single star and a single planet, or maybe even just a large brown
<br>
dwarf whose surface was cool enough for life.  And &quot;far more likely&quot; is
<br>
really an understatement here; the degree of difference in probability is
<br>
beyond astronomical.  Hence almost all observers would see a nearly empty
<br>
universe, and observers like us would be so rare among the collection
<br>
of all observers who ever exist as to be practically nonexistent.
<br>
<p>All this is generally considered a historical footnote in the conceptual
<br>
foundations of thermodynamics, but this recent paper claims that it
<br>
could apply to our own universe.  Here is where my physics understanding
<br>
breaks down.  Despite the fact that the universe is predicted (under
<br>
current models) to expand at an ever-increasing rate, thinning the
<br>
density of matter and energy down to approximately zero, the authors
<br>
boldly re-scale their coordinates, using an expanding coordinate frame in
<br>
which the universe is constant in size.  Presto, we have a more or less
<br>
steady-state universe.  The problem I couldn't get past is that it would
<br>
have a zero density, hence no opportunity for random collections of matter
<br>
to form, but perhaps there is some esoteric effect that overcomes this.
<br>
<p>So if this is true, we are back to the paradox above, that almost
<br>
all observers that will ever exist will see a very empty universe.
<br>
They will live potentially happy, healthy lives, just as we do; but
<br>
they won't have any stars to look at.  The fact that we see uncounted
<br>
trillions of stars is fundamentally inconsistent with any application of
<br>
the principle that we are typical observers, if the authors are correct.
<br>
(The authors also point out that even those few observers who see a big
<br>
universe will not see one that plausibly came from a recent Big Bang,
<br>
since it did not in fact do so.  However I think that's icing on the cake,
<br>
the size issue is more fundamental.)
<br>
<p>The conclusion that their work points to is not that the anthropic
<br>
principle is wrong, but rather that physics is wrong.  Assuming they
<br>
are right about the properties of this expanding de Sitter mode, then
<br>
this work suggests that the current picture of the eventual future of
<br>
the universe must be mistaken.  The universe will not get into a state
<br>
of rapid, exponential expansion that goes on forever.  Our physicists
<br>
have made a mistake.
<br>
<p>Well, that wouldn't really be that big a surprise; the current model is
<br>
only a few years old, and it is certainly possible that ten years from
<br>
now we'll have different ideas about how the universe will turn out.
<br>
The interesting thing about this paper is that it uses anthropic-style
<br>
reasoning to argue that current physical theories must have this sort
<br>
of error.
<br>
