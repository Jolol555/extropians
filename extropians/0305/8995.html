</em><br>

</em><br>
### The problem with scientist-bureaucrats is that although they might have
<br>
the factual knowledge in some narrow domain (e.g. concentrations of dioxin
<br>
in Superfund sites) they are not asked to take into consideration the costs
<br>
they impose on the subjects of their regulations, and they respond to the
<br>
legislated wishes of politicians, who have neither the knowledge, nor much
<br>
of an incentive to contain costs. If an EPA scientist finds that a Superfund
<br>
site contains some concentration of dioxin, he will use the rules demanding
<br>
complete cleanup of the site (passed by Congress), regardless of whether the
<br>
dioxin has even the remotest chance of affecting human life, resulting in,
<br>
literally, billion-dollar expenses without a shred of proof that a single
<br>
human life would be saved (of course, spending a billion dollars on a
<br>
useless endeavor actually kills people by taking the resources away form
<br>
useful ones, but this is a different story). Basically, delegation of
<br>
legislative authority to bureaucratic bodies removes the feedback loop
<br>
between politician and citizen that normally constrains legislations a bit,
<br>
and replaces it with a much weaker feedback loop between politician and
<br>
bureaucrat. Bad idea.
<br>
<p>There are some tricks one could try to solve the science-laden problems in
<br>
legislation. One is the stretchable parliament - the number of MP's selected
<br>
by lot would be adjusted to keep the number of laws per MP stable. One MP
<br>
would be assigned (perhaps in a lottery/first-come-first-serve basis) a
<br>
certain number of pages of law to read, understand and vote on (there would
<br>
have to be enough MP's to assure that each law is covered by a statistically
<br>
valid sample of all MP's), so they would only vote on stuff they really know
<br>
or like.
<br>
<p>The other trick is to defer most decisions to insurers, with EPA-like
<br>
bureaucracies providing only the factual information (e.g. how many people
<br>
will be killed by dioxin disposed of in a certain way, versus another
<br>
method). Most of the issues addressed by EPA and OSHA are related to
<br>
identifiable harms to identifiable persons stemming from identifiable
<br>
activities of other persons. As such, they can be quantified, adjudicated by
<br>
courts and risks can be pooled by insurance. A general demand that agents in
<br>
the economy (workers, employers, organizations) purchase liability insurance
<br>
sufficient to cover all their likely liability could be made by the
<br>
legislator, and adjudicated based on the EPA-provided information by courts
<br>
using the strict liability principle. Then, independent decision-makers
<br>
would try to maximize their benefit - by finding the best balance between
<br>
expenses on dioxin remediation, avoidance of dioxin in the first place, by
<br>
adjusting insurance premiums to best convey information about the costs of
<br>
certain behaviors, etc., much more flexibly and precisely than the current
<br>
system - because the feedback loops would be between the wallets of closely
<br>
collaborating individuals, and not the global choices of millions of people
<br>
made once every four years. Some behaviors, although not illegal, would
<br>
disappear, because the cost of liability insurance associated with them
<br>
would be higher than the economic gain from them.
