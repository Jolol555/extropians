<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;The development of modafinil brings to light a crucial social question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What would be the impediment for its use, if a compound such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; modafinil is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more like caffeine than amphetamine in terms of safety, and yet, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effective as the amphetamines?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from - <a href="http://www.modafinil.info">http://www.modafinil.info</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would suggest contemplating trying modafinil (aka Provigil).  This has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been mentioned on the list before, its probably the 1st drug that taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; regularly could reduce the need and desire for sleep.  I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been taking it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for some time now, and find it quite effective.  If you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way to stay awake and alert throughout the day, this might be an optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would be very interested in hearing your experiences with this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  How many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hours do you sleep per day while on this drug?  How do you feel?  Have you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noticed any fatigue, mental dullness, or lack of physical energy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  For what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose are you taking this drug; to reduce the number hours of sleep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required, or to combat sleepiness during the day?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I have been taking this off and on for probably about four months now.  For
<br>
about a month straight, I was working a 40 hour/week daytime job, a 20 hour
<br>
per week evening job, and another 10 - 20 hours on personal projects.
<br>
During this time, my typical day consisted of working from 7am to 5 pm
<br>
(including commute), then 3 - 4hours each evening from home on the computer,
<br>
then 2 - 3 hours on project work.  Another hour or two of miscellaneous
<br>
computer work, and I would hit the sack around 3 - 5 am.  Getting up at 7
<br>
again the next morning.  1 100mg modafinil tab kept me awake and alert
<br>
throughout the 8 hour workshift, even kept me up during boring corporate
<br>
meetings in stuffy board rooms that would normally knock me out even with a
<br>
full nights sleep.  Taking only 1 pill per day in this manner I would
<br>
usually end up 1 evening each week taking a 2 or 3 hour nap.  Before taking
<br>
modafinil, I would be very tired throughout the day even with a good 7 - 8
<br>
hours of sleep each night, often having trouble staying awake during
<br>
meetings and on the drive home (very dangerous, I highly recommend anyone
<br>
who has trouble staying awake driving to pull over right away, its the
<br>
leading cause of vehiclular accidents and death behind chemical alterations
<br>
AFAIK)
<br>
<p>My 40hour week job ended, and I discontinued this pattern, taking it only on
<br>
late nights or long drives.  For these, it is phenomenal at keeping one
<br>
awake, and causes no jitteryness or loss of memory or shortening attention
<br>
span like caffiene does.
<br>
<p>Recently my various work has required more time, and I decided to try the
<br>
modafinil every 8 hours, which is what is required to singificanly impact
<br>
the need for sleep (taking 1 each day, I still seemed to require a little
<br>
bit of 'catch up' sleep, though not as much as if I was taking none at all).
<br>
For two weeks I was taking it every 8 hours, and going on less than four
<br>
hours a sleep each night, pulling 2 all nighters in that time.  As far as I
<br>
could tell, none of this impacted me negatively, some of the following
<br>
mornings I was doing heavy physical labor helping a friend clear a lot where
<br>
he is building a new house, which including cutting down trees with
<br>
chainsaws and various other rather dangerous work when going on very little
<br>
sleep, my ability to perform these functions did not appear to be affected
<br>
whatsoever.  My non-extropic friend was quite surprised to hear of my lack
<br>
of sleep for the previous week.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, I ran out of pills.  Modafinil is not a cheap drug, without
<br>
health insurance coverage itll run you ~$5.00 per pill.  Before my 2 week
<br>
experiement and post my hectic 70hour schedule I resolved to take it only
<br>
while doing productive things.  No staying up all night watching the history
<br>
channel or playing video games.  I was interested in seeing it run out so I
<br>
could again compare my modafinil behavior with my regular behavior, I became
<br>
much more aware of the normal daytime drowsiness and sleepyiness I would
<br>
feel two or three times each day without any modafinil.  I experience no
<br>
daytime sleepiness while using it.
<br>
<p>The major clinical studies done on this which produced significant sleep
<br>
reduction were 200mg every 8 hours for days on end, this would amount to $30
<br>
per day modafinil habit.  Perhaps if I was in a higher income bracket I
<br>
could normally swing this.  Those studies reported individuals going 2 or 3
<br>
days straight with no sleep, no concentration problems, and no jitterness or
<br>
microsleep episodes.  With just 1 100mg tablet every 8 hours, I could pretty
<br>
much cut my sleep requirements in half, with no ill effects (that I know
<br>
of).  I plan on expirmenting with using other, cheaper stimulates (caffiene
<br>
primarily) to boost my wakefullness during my normal wakefull hours, and
<br>
hopefully have nearly the same effect as the 3 100 mg tabs every 8 hours,
<br>
but go on 2 100mg tabs and 1 200mg caffiene tabs, then sleeping 4 hours.  I
<br>
did find I could have pulled more all nighters during my 3 tab per day
<br>
trial, but pyschologically I become *very* unmotivated during some of those
<br>
late evenings, I think I needed to have a psychological seperation between
<br>
the days, and would be perfectly willing to get right up 4 hours later and
<br>
put another 12 - 16 hours into whatever I needed to do that day.
<br>
<p>I did not seem to experience any negative mental effects, seemed just as
<br>
able to remember old things and learn new things.  My phsycial energy seemed
<br>
fine as well, no less than normal (aside from sleepiness, physical energy in
<br>
reference to capability to do something before muscle tiring or exhaustion)
<br>
Although I would note that the general feeling of fatigued body and muscles
<br>
was present, but just barely.  Its hard to explain, its like staying up a
<br>
day straight and working hard, then getting 2 - 4 hours a sleep, and having
<br>
to get up again.  The exhaustion and lack of concentration was not there on
<br>
modafinil, but there was some 'remnant' achyness and soreness, though not
<br>
significant.  Im not sure if this would build up with continual use, and the
<br>
extent of this seemed to diminish to barely noticable to my 2 week 3 tab/day
<br>
trial.  It was much more noticable during my initial usage, the 1 tab/day
<br>
while working 70 hours per week.
<br>
<p>To answer your purposefullness question, you hit my two primary reasons.  I
<br>
would like to require less sleep, as I see we spend 1/3rd of our lives
<br>
sleeping, needing less sleep would result in a practical life extension,
<br>
increasing my number of subjective wakefull people hours experienced.  I
<br>
noticed this accutely when I realized half of my wakefull hours saw my
<br>
girlfriend asleep, and I realized how much I was doing while she was
<br>
sleeping.  Over the two week period, I experienced probably 3 more days of
<br>
awake time than she did.  However, as I noted, I seemed to often need a
<br>
psychological seperation between the days, though this may be something
<br>
someone could overcome.  If not a practical reduction in sleep needs, at the
<br>
very least, this would help to keep me awake and alert throughout the day
<br>
when I would normally experience many boughts of drowsiness.  Admittedly It
<br>
would be better if I was in better shape, and combining optimal health with
<br>
modifinl might result in a significant reduction in required sleep time.
<br>
One may need the continued 200mg 3times /day dosage to singificantly reduce
<br>
required sleep, but I dont know what the extended long term consequences of
<br>
this would be.  I did experience a few seconds on two different occurances
<br>
during my two week trial of wakefull hullicinations, no idea if this would
<br>
get worse with a higher dosage / less sleep.
<br>
<p>Modafinil is a strange drug, it doesnt *keep* you awake like caffiene and
<br>
other stimulants and you can sleep while taking it regularly, if you want
<br>
to.  It seems to reduce the bodies demand for sleep, but will not keep you
<br>
from sleeping.
<br>
<p>My girlfriend, who due to a Thyroid disorder, normally requires 8 - 10 hours
<br>
sleep now regularly gets 6 - 8 hours and takes 1/2 of a 100mg tablet each
<br>
day.  She also reports that modafinil acts as a mild appetite suppressent
<br>
(cant say if it had this affect on me) and a mild mood enhancer.
<br>
<p>Thus concludes my very subjective single data point clinical trial of
<br>
Modafinil.  Hope that helps in your decision to use / not use modafinil.
