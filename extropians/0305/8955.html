Here is an abbreviated repost of a message I wrote last year when this
<br>
topic was previously discussed:
<br>
<p>It's amazing to see how an *extremely* speculative prediction has now
<br>
migrated to conventional wisdom.  Another article claiming the same thing
<br>
is <a href="http://www.nature.com/nsu/011004/011004-8.html">http://www.nature.com/nsu/011004/011004-8.html</a>:
<br>
<p>: Physicists at may soon be manufacturing copious quantities of black
<br>
: holes. When the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European particle
<br>
: physics laboratory near Geneva, is completed in 2005, it could produce
<br>
: a black hole every second.
<br>
<p>It's only when we follow the link at the bottom of that article to
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/0106219">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/0106219</a> that we see:
<br>
<p>: If the fundamental Planck scale is of order a TeV, as the case in some
<br>
: extra-dimensions scenarios, future hadron colliders such as the Large
<br>
: Hadron Collider will be black hole factories.
<br>
<p>See?  It's only true in theories of extra dimensions, where the
<br>
universe has something like 10 spatial dimension.  These theories are
<br>
extremely speculative to say the least.  The LHC will be a good test of
<br>
the existence of these extra dimensions but I doubt that many people
<br>
seriously expect the theory to be confirmed.  The conventional Planck
<br>
scale is 10^19 GeV, and these guys are assuming it is about 10^3 GeV.
<br>
Their prediction is 16 orders of magnitude different from conventional
<br>
physics!  It can't be ruled out but it is far from the mainstream.
<br>
<p>So we have gone from a test of extra-dimensional physics at the LHC to
<br>
the fact that the LHC is &quot;expected&quot; to generate black holes.  Somebody
<br>
is being awfully sloppy.
<br>
<p>Hal
<br>
<p>P.S. The really interesting thing is that if this prediction were true,
<br>
and the LHC really did create black holes, it would essentially spell
<br>
the end for particle physics!  From the TeV energy scale on up, particle
<br>
dynamics would be dominated by gravitational interactions.  All higher
<br>
energy particles would be cloaked in black holes.  There would be no
<br>
way to learn anything more about the nature of particles beyond that
<br>
energy barrier.  You could still learn about the nature of the universe,
<br>
of space-time, of the size of the various dimensions.  But you'd be
<br>
stuck with guesses and theoretical modelling as far as the particle
<br>
zoo.
