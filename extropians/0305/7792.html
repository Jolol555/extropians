In a message dated 5/6/2003 2:25:31 PM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:weidai@weidai.com?Subject=Re:%20[Politics]%20Re:%20The%20United%20Nations:%20Unfit%20to%20govern">weidai@weidai.com</a> writes: There's a great book about the historical 
<br>
interactions between war, military strategy, international law, and 
<br>
constitutional law. It's titled The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the 
<br>
Course of History by Philip Bobbitt. I recommend this book highly and it is 
<br>
very relevant to the current discussion.
<br>
<p>Weidai,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked up Shield of Achilles via Amazon as a result of your 
<br>
recommendation.  When I see a book I want to add to my list I usually look it 
<br>
up on Amazon, print out Amazon's advertising blurb and put the printed sheet 
<br>
into my future reading stack.  I did so in this case also.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Bobbitt made an interesting observation about the epochal war Let 
<br>
me see if I can connect two very tangled strands out of our recent history.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First the American Dr. Bartlett wrote in his article in the March 2003 
<br>
issue of Esquire of his discovery that the set of underdeveloped countries 
<br>
are the source of the strife in the world.  The article is on line and I 
<br>
recommend it to you.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I have also been following a site that has been conducting an 
<br>
on going reporting of the Second Gulf war.  I read a follow up analysis of 
<br>
that war from the stand point of Russian diplomacy.  BTW, the site claims to 
<br>
be the output of Russian intelligence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular report I am referring to is at
<br>
<a href="http://www.iraqwar.ru/iraq-read_article.php?articleId=4129&amp;lang=en">http://www.iraqwar.ru/iraq-read_article.php?articleId=4129&amp;lang=en</a><br>
<p>And contains the following paragraph, &quot;The epoch of national liberation 
<br>
movements and revolutions, and the socialist experiments between the 1940s 
<br>
and 1990s, gave rise to a vast number of states that demonstrated their 
<br>
inability to provide an adequate level of development and a decent standard 
<br>
of living for the majority of their people. The absence of development or 
<br>
worse, widespread corruption, ineffective despotic regimes beset by 
<br>
demographic and religious problems -- these are a growing threat not only for 
<br>
the states themselves and their populations, but also for the rest of 
<br>
mankind. It is precisely the regions where these states are clustered that 
<br>
are the major sources of instability, disease and terrorism.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I added the underline to one word.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is this: are we also engaged in an epochal war with these 
<br>
failed socialists states as their dictators strive to maintain their offices? 
<br>
&nbsp;Rephrased are these nothing but continuations of the collapse of the USSR?
