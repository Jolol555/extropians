<br>
that they appreciate your  vote and your canvassing work, there's suggestions 
<br>
they couldn't care less about your 'influence' on their 'policy'. Consider:
<br>
<p>Mike,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have operated that the real power to influence elections in this 
<br>
country lies in the hands of that small percentage of people that go door to 
<br>
door asking for votes.  Later those same people are essential in getting out 
<br>
the vote.  I also buy into the theory that no election was ever lost in this 
<br>
country that the loser's &quot;stay at home&quot; vote wouldn't have been sufficient to 
<br>
provide him a win.  Now obviously we have to take this with a grain of salt 
<br>
but I believe the principle to be largely true.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what this or that party or individual thinks of my thoughts and 
<br>
efforts in influencing the vote, I truly don't care.  I have won my viewpoint 
<br>
and I have lost.  When I have lost it has seemed to always have been a case o 
<br>
the opposition caring more for their candidate and turning out in greater 
<br>
numbers &amp; working harder than my side did.  I may not like that but I accept 
<br>
the justice of the result.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it seems a little difficult to pin down what you think about Leo 
<br>
Strauss and what William Pfaff thinks and you only quote.  However he did 
<br>
exist, he was in the political science department of the U of C for a time.  
<br>
For those of you that wish to check him out you might look up a speech of his 
<br>
at
<br>
<a href="http://www.cnphysis.com/civil/yuanwen.htm">http://www.cnphysis.com/civil/yuanwen.htm</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't recognise Mike's position on Pfaff at all when I look at 
<br>
Strauss' own words.
