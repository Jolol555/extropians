editor of The Spectator (the Brit political/news mag) who had filed a story
<br>
with the NY Times about the US making donations to members of the UN
<br>
Security Council to win support for US action on Iraq.  His story mentioned
<br>
as an hypothetical example, &quot;giving new squash courts to the President of

Guinea&quot; which was changed in the paper to read &quot;President of Chile&quot;.  He

complained, only to be told by the checker that &quot;as a matter of principle

but that doesn't seem to apply now.  Perhaps it's because journalists these

days are better (?) educated than hitherto, or that journalism is now

regarded as a profession rather than a craft.  Whatever.  We've all seen it

in news reports on topics that we might know more about than the journo

writing the story.  Often the stories are complete crap.

<p>For another interesting take on the Times and its bias these days, 
<br>
consider Monday's Joe Conason column for salon.com in which he looks at 
<br>
the way one of the NYT's White Water EDITORS reviewed the Sidney 
<br>
Blumenthal book The Clinton Wars last week. The factual howlers are 
<br>
everywhere, and this was a guy in charge at the time. Helps explain why 
<br>
the paper savaged our last elected president even in the absence of 
<br>
evidence against him for the crimes he never committed. Amazing stuff, at 
<br>
least to me.

<p>I think this drift is a myth. Opinion passed as news is alive and thriving 
<br>
in England as even a cursory clance at the papers will show, and has a 
<br>
long history in the US. Mark Twain's &quot;How To Edit an Agricultural Paper&quot; 
<br>
(may not be the exact title) was hardly exaggeration. Well, all right, 
<br>
that's exactly what it was, but I'm sure the images were drawn from 
<br>
Twain's years as a reporter in the Midwest as well as on papers like The 
<br>
Territorial Enterprise in Virginia City and whoever he was reporting for 
<br>
in San Francisco when he went to the Sandwich Islands.
<br>
<p>George Seldes tells lots of tales in Lords of the Press, which details the 
<br>
rise of the great US newspaper families and in his shrill but documented 
<br>
volumes with names like You Can't Print That, where, among other things, 
<br>
you can read colorful stories of the US reporters in Europe during WWII 
<br>
who were not just embedded, they were in uniform IN the miltary and 
<br>
answerable to Patton. Somehow, at least some of them still got the story 
<br>
out. But the so-called free press has always been reserved for those who 
<br>
own one. Ask Seldes, or Izzy Stone, who followed in his footsteps. Ask 
<br>
Ralph Ginzburg or Barney Rosset what price freedom.
<br>
<p>And then find a tradition of reporting devoid of viewpoint. Royce Brier 
<br>
winning his Pulitzer by commandering the only phone booth to report on the 
<br>
last lynching in California was no more keeping his viewpoint out of the 
<br>
story than Richard Harding Davis watching the Germans invade Belgium in 
<br>
the fog, marching in &quot;like a tide of gray ghosts.&quot;
<br>
<p>Forget Hearst, look at the origins of the Chicago Trib, the NY Post, of
<br>
the LA Times, which once nearly caused a war with Mexico because the
<br>
Chandlers, the family owners, didn't want to pay taxes on property they
<br>
owned there. Or the thunderous headlines when the San Francisco Chronicle
<br>
discovered a local bakery was going to begin selling all of its English
<br>
muffins pre-sliced. Exec Ed Scott Newhall ran front page banner lines for
<br>
days investigating the &quot;scandal.&quot; Separating opinion and fact? It's a nice 
<br>
story, but it's not true and maybe never was. If someone can make a case 
<br>
for it being the norm at some time and place, that would be instructive, 
<br>
but it will take some proving, I betcha.
