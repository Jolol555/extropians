<p>I don't see how, since these coca fields would be in addition (I
<br>
suppose) to the ag fields. Plus if all drugs were legalized, there'd be
<br>
the marijuana fields, etc. Where would all these acres/hectares come from?

<p><em>&gt; ### You suggest sterilization not as a policy, but merely as an exercise in

</em><br>
<p>Yep. In response to the hunters' claim that their hunting (which they
<br>
have always done anyway) is the only &quot;rational wildlife management&quot; that
<br>
can prevent overpopulation &amp; starvation of wild animals. The existence of
<br>
an alternative (which some have implemented, not me, and not officially
<br>
that I know of) disproves their point. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; ### What kind of evidence would you like to offer in support of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; claim?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What evidence would you expect? I have a cousin who is a hunter and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lame one today! Me big hunter!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Hearsay!
</em><br>
<p>So you are telling me all hunters deliberately try to catch the most
<br>
inferior animals?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### If enough people are really concerned about the welfare of deer and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truly want to help them by sterilization, you will be able to gather enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funds. Of course, it's easier to ask the local congressman to do pay for it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with other people's money, but I think I might be digressing here.
</em><br>
<p>People don't know what they want. Hunters know they want to hunt, and the
<br>
political system is designed to match their intentions. Animal lovers are
<br>
too disorganized, politically naive or unconnected, have no political
<br>
system (machine) in place. What people *want*, and how many of them want
<br>
it, is of only partial relevance to what happens. People don't want smog
<br>
in their cities, either, but there it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Me an agitator for the Endloesung of Earth's living problems? That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't be true!
</em><br>
<p>There are the super villains - Gnostic types dedicated to the
<br>
extermination of everything in order to end all suffering - all human
<br>
life, animal life, and even inanimate matter. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### If you were to say that hunters actually are *not* like child molesters,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could retract my assessment of your beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have to retract something I didn't say :) I said *remunerating*
<br>
hunters for not being able to hunt would be like remunerating child
<br>
molesters for not being able to molest children. I suspect hunters would
<br>
be rather above being bribed anyway - they want to hunt - no amount of
<br>
money would satisfy them to give up hunting. And there is an analogy to
<br>
that for child molesters, too. And to my position - I would not accept any
<br>
payment from hunters to compensate for their devastation, because that
<br>
would be utterly irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### As in: &quot;We just voted that you can't hunt, here or everywhere. It makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us quite happy to vote, you know.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I noted before that your ethics is incommensurate with mine, but I think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference lies not in the superficialities of money but in the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom - this is the bedrock of my ethics, but not yours. It leads to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness, too.
</em><br>
<p>IMHO freedom is a means to an end, not an end. Freedom not exercised well,
<br>
thoughtfully, beneficially, with other goals in mind, is just a blank
<br>
check of power. It can be abused, lost, sold to the highest bidder. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Blowing a hole in the brain isn't painful. Being shot in the chest with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a large caliber hunting rifle for a human is hardly painful at all in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning (there are descriptions of survivors), so animals couldn't feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much pain, either. Much less than the pain of being eaten alive by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wildcat.
</em><br>
<p>Any pain caused by humans is pain the humans are responsible for, and if
<br>
unnecessary, it is their fault, and its meaning and significance is
<br>
well known to humans, and cannot be blamed on instinctive nature
<br>
(such as wildcats). I would remind you that not all hunted animals are
<br>
killed with a single shot to the head (pace hunters' intentions), or
<br>
killed in a single instant. It's my understanding that many hunters
<br>
actually enjoy trailing the wounded animal. Also, it is illogical to argue
<br>
that any wild animal not shot by a hunter would immediately then otherwise
<br>
be eaten alive by a wildcat. There is such a thing as living a longer
<br>
life, having more enjoyable experiences, that are not insignificant to the
<br>
animal and should not be insignificant to us. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### You can have fun doing the rational thing, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only Puritans though anything that feels good must be bad.
</em><br>
<p>Oh no, I am sure feeding and sterilizing wild animals is quite fun. And I
<br>
bet it also makes a person feel good inside, proud of themselves and
<br>
their compassionate relationship with the animals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### But deer are fungible automatons, not irreplaceable individuals or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentimentally important works of art.
</em><br>
<p>Here is the proof of the incommensurability of our philosophies. This
<br>
statement is the exact opposite of what I believe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### The developers have only as much money as their clients are willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay. If clients become rich enough to dream about unspoiled nature, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will build it, too. It's all a question of demand and supply. If human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness demands the last inch to be built up, or every inch to be turned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a forest, the market will provide. Really.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The market will provide&quot; has almost a religious ring to it. The market
<br>
will not provide me or anyone else Tasmanian wolves or woolly mammoths, no
<br>
matter how much I would be willing to pay for them (and believe me, there
<br>
are people in this world who would and could pay vast fortunes for
<br>
them). 
<br>
<p>Some stupid mistakes are irrevocable. And wiser folks cannot always be
<br>
everywhere and rich enough to buy off fools.
