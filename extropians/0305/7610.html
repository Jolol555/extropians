<p>Hunting is a rather expensive hobby, actually, from what I have
<br>
heard. Where hunters are hunting, also, land cannot be used by tourists
<br>
observing wildlife or just hiking and camping out. That is an economic
<br>
loss in the recreational use of land.
<br>
<p>Also, whereas natural predators (not being heavily armed) pick off the
<br>
weak and inferior, trophy-hunting hunters pick off the largest and
<br>
healthiest specimens, a reverse culling that is obviously detrimental to
<br>
the herds.
<br>
<p>Sterilization, if offered by volunteer veterinarians, is extremely low
<br>
cost. Sterilizing agents can even be introduced into food, which is so
<br>
cheap and effective it has to be done very carefully to avoid eliminating
<br>
a population altogether. It is also painless since it prevents the problem
<br>
(animals that will starve) rather than dealing with it after-the-fact
<br>
(shooting the said animals after they have been born).
<br>
<p>I don't feel any need to remunerate hunters for loss of &quot;hobby&quot;, any more
<br>
than I would feel the need to remunerate child molestors for depriving
<br>
them of the ability to molest children. What recreational hunters do,
<br>
killing animals without needing to, is extremely unethical and inhumane,
<br>
and has no place in a civilized society, which you obviously equate with a 
<br>
recreational hunting society. The suggestion that blowing bloody holes in
<br>
wild animals can be a &quot;pleasant experience&quot; makes my stomach turn. I am
<br>
sure, though, that subjectively this is true. Mass murderers of humans 
<br>
also probably experience their romps as &quot;pleasant experiences&quot;. If the
<br>
hunter folks are just after excitement, let them risk their own lives in
<br>
the woods, not take those of helpless others. If they want to practice
<br>
targeting, let them choose some inanimate targets. Try paintballing. Hey,
<br>
hunt other hunters, I would be OK with that. Just get a life...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a result of the Supreme Court decision of 1896 (that was the year, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think), most wild animals in the US are owned by the state, opening their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; management to the political process and ideological warfare, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deleterious effects for all creatures involved (including animals, forests,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; landowners, and car drivers).
</em><br>
<p>The most deleterious effect on wildlife in the US, IMO, is urban sprawl
<br>
and other human encroachments on wild areas. This is how we lose the big
<br>
predators, which can lead to the overly big herds, etc. - disruption of
<br>
traditional ecosystem balances. The problem is caused by humans, so humans
<br>
should solve it - not by blaming animals, shooting them when they are &quot;in 
<br>
excess&quot; (humans getting to define excess, conveniently enough), etc. If
<br>
humans try to densely occupy every square inch of this earth, the
<br>
ecological consequences will be upon us shortly enough, along with the
<br>
massive aesthetic losses.
