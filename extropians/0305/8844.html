<p>As promised, here are seven possible fallacies:
<br>
<p>1.  The more recent a President's term, the more pages about that 
<br>
President may be online.
<br>
<p>2.  The number of people accusing a President of X does not necessarily 
<br>
correlate in any way with whether a President is actually guilty of X. 
<br>
This, of course, is the most important point on the list.
<br>
<p>3.  Did the author test more than one phrase before reporting the results 
<br>
for &quot;crime family&quot;?  (I'm sure Wiik didn't actually do that, but it's 
<br>
something one should think of when seeing this kind of report on, say, 
<br>
rec.humor.funny.)
<br>
<p>4.  Are Democrats more likely than Republicans to use the phrase 'crime 
<br>
family'?  Are Democrats more likely than Republicans to repeat the phrase 
<br>
'crime family'?  (See also point 3 - if people who dislike Bush are 
<br>
predisposed to think of the particular phrase 'crime family', for whatever 
<br>
reason, and the author dislikes Bush, the author is more likely to type 
<br>
that particular phrase into Google.)
<br>
<p>5.  Is Bush a more common name to begin with?  (Looking at the Google 
<br>
results, it appears that most of the pages returned are indeed about 
<br>
presidents rather than other individuals who happen to be named Bush or 
<br>
Clinton - but I did look.)
<br>
<p>6.  There were two Presidents named Bush, whose results are being added 
<br>
together.  (Yes, they are part of the same &quot;family&quot;, but regardless.)
<br>
<p>7.  It is a salient fact about Bush II that he is known as the son of Bush 
<br>
I - this may predispose people to use the phrase 'crime *family*' in their 
<br>
accusations, regardless of which of the three Presidents has been most 
<br>
frequently accused of crime or criminal connections.  See also point 2.
