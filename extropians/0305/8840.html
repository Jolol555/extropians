<p>There is some interesting research done by Karl Magnus Petersson and
<br>
Martin Ingvar of the Karolinska Hospital. They did a fMRI scan of the
<br>
brains of Portugese women from two neighboring villages, one where women
<br>
learned to read, one where they didn't, when the women heard and 
<br>
memorized nonsense words. It turns out that learning to read and write 
<br>
changes the cortical representations of language noticeably, and 
<br>
improves the performance on the task a lot since the words are now 
<br>
decomposed into phonemes rather than seen as concepts. 
<br>
<p>The brain definitely has a built in framework for language, enabling us
<br>
to learn it very quickly. But the rest of the brain is a very flexible
<br>
learning matrix where areas can apparently be trained to do almost any
<br>
task. It is notable that congenitally blind people appear to use the
<br>
parts of the occipital lobe normally used for vision for interpreting
<br>
Braille writing, a linguistic-somatosensory task.  When we learn to read
<br>
and write we create new representations in additional areas (more
<br>
posterior from the auditory language areas) and link them with the old
<br>
language system, changing it somewhat in the process. 
<br>
<p>So I would say that we already had the potential for reading and writing 
<br>
*before language*, it was just that they would have been utterly 
<br>
pointless tasks without any linguistic content. With language writing 
<br>
became a potential thing to learn, but the actual implementation of 
<br>
writing systems would take far longer.
