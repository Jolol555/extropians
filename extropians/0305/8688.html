</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course there is evidence, at least for a move in that direction. For
<br>
example the cave paintings at Lascaux, France, show a painstaking attention
<br>
to detail. The paintings were likely meant to seen by other HG'ers as
<br>
stories about real life events experienced or witnessed by the painters, and
<br>
surely those painters had some concept of the communication of numbers as
<br>
they told their stories in their paintings.
<br>
<p>I see no fundamental distinction between cave paintings of wild animals and
<br>
more abstract symbols representing a number of animals used later during
<br>
Neolithic and modern times. Even a cave painting of an animal is a
<br>
tremendous feat of mental abstraction. A two-dimensional painting of two
<br>
bears in limited colors scratched onto a cave wall, though not what we
<br>
normally call a written word, is nevertheless an abstract symbol
<br>
representing two bears. If written words are abstract symbols portrayed on a
<br>
two dimensional surface and designed to represent real entities then cave
<br>
paintings *are* written words.
<br>
<p>It is true of course that the *degree* of abstraction increased as the need
<br>
for more abstract abbreviations became greater, as during early commerce,
<br>
(hash marks are a lot easier to draw than horses) and the ability to
<br>
manipulate those symbols also grew (early math) but I think it is a mistake
<br>
to think something fundamentally new happened to human mental capacity at
<br>
the advent of agriculture. I think it was a difference only of degree. The
<br>
real breakthrough to symbolic thinking took place at least some 30,000+
<br>
years earlier.
