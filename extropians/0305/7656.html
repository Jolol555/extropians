<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe you were Lee,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        The Republicans I talked to in the runup to the 2000 AD election had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coalesced around a set of ideas.  No one I am aware of running for office in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Republican party (all the way back to George, Sr.) had really expressed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that set of ideas.  George Bush had the wit to go in on his first speech to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Republican Nominating Convention and express those ideas -- he was on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same page of the song book they were singing from.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that really amazes me.  But if you talked to the people, and
<br>
that's what they said, then you're closer to the reality than I.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        It reminds me of the speech by Claudius in the PBS production of &quot;I, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Claudius.&quot;  May I paraphrase?  &quot;You say I am inarticulate, but I spoke well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to tell my core constituency what I was thinking.  You say I lack 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence but I had the wit to tell my core constituency I felt as they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felt.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Okay, so here are some reasons IMO the *voters* might select
<br>
someone who is running in an American primary election:
<br>
<p>A. He looks nicer than his opponent (more handsome or beautiful)
<br>
B. Embraces policies the voter agrees with, or is ideologically
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compatible with the voter
<br>
C. Is perceived to be a &quot;vote-getter&quot;, i.e., is judged to have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a better chance in the final election
<br>
<p>Sadly, I think that the above also prioritizes the reasons.
<br>
<p>Next, here are IMO the reasons why the power brokers behind
<br>
the big political parties choose to support someone:
<br>
<p>A. He can win (e.g., is a vote-getter, or has enough money)
<br>
B. He is a team player (knows how the system works
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will repay favors)
<br>
C. Agrees with the party's ideology
<br>
<p>These too I have placed in order of what I perceive to be the
<br>
reality.  Disagreements, of course, more than welcome.
<br>
<p>Lee
