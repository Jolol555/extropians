But then what did the latin word mean?  I'm fairly certain that it 
<br>
wasn't what we mean by virus.  Perhaps &quot;a virus&quot; means a species of 
<br>
virus as well as an individual virus, and it's the species that has the 
<br>
plural virii  (viri looks like it means men, or perhaps soldiers, but my 
<br>
latin is long behind me). 
<br>
<p>That said, I admit myself to using  plurals like stewardi (or possibly 
<br>
stewardae), and socksen (that is actually English+Norse, not Latin, 
<br>
though).  And with that background, I could hardly be considered a 
<br>
serious reference.
