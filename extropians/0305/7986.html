</em><br>
<p>This is true.  However, it is not too soon to declare that U.S. intelligence
<br>
was flawed.  We have already searched hundreds of sites where we were &quot;sure&quot;
<br>
we would find bioweapons manufacturing.  None of them turned out to be what
<br>
the U.S. claimed.  Even if we do eventually find something somewhere, it is
<br>
clear that U.S. intelligence was just plain wrong on almost everything.  It
<br>
may be that they were lying as an excuse to attack Iraq.  It may be that
<br>
they were so interested in finding an excuse that the selectively
<br>
interpreted intelligence reports in a way to say what they hoped they would
<br>
say.  But the bottom line is that other countries won't put up with our
<br>
claim that we have secret evidence that will be presented later.  From now
<br>
on, I expect the U.S. will be distrusted unless it shows clear evidence up
<br>
front.
<br>
<p>(This applies to &quot;enemy combatants&quot; as well, now that dozens of the
<br>
prisoners have been released from Guantanamo with no connection to any
<br>
crimes or war activity.  Secret evidence and hidden tribunals always fail to
<br>
be fair, and this round has been no different.  The world won't put up with
<br>
their citizens being detained without notification, without lawyers, without
<br>
evidence, and without a chance to defend themselves.)
