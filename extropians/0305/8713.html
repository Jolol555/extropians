R. Bradbury asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;For example, if I had the means, time, energy, etc. should I
<br>
be supporting myself or my politicians in reforming the
<br>
building code in Algiers or the health code in Taiwan???
<br>
Robert&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>OK, a taxonomy of world issues relating to Extropian goals. 
<br>
Points:
<br>
1) We can do nothing about quakes, except create better architecture that 
<br>
resists
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quakes. Detecting when quakes will happen would be a life-saver. An early
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warning system is needed. In an age of smart buildings, and 
<br>
super-materials
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Drexler-wise), we could eliminate deaths. However this confluence of 
<br>
technologies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may properly be 200 years off; as opposed to something more timely. 
<br>
<p>2) Sars is a newly arisen virus, which we might be able to affect using 
<br>
anti-virals or 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other chemical reactions in the human biology. Its impact is global, 
<br>
rather then
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;localized like an earthquake. 
<br>
<p>I would say that laws or movements that hinder &quot;responsible&quot; research are a 
<br>
threat to Extropian goals. I would opine that laws, funding, investment that 
<br>
accelerates basic and applied research are the area to focus on, if your 
<br>
interest is specifically in furthering Extropian goals.
<br>
<p>My own sense of achieving Extropian goals; seems likely to be understanding 
<br>
and promoting useful areas of physics, astromomy, biology, engineering, and 
<br>
philosophy as the potential seed-grains for new ideas. This is the cheapest way 
<br>
to go, but also the longest term. No quick ROI here.
