<p><em>&gt; I am finding the following line of reasoning compelling:

</em><br>
<p>True.  But wouldn't the best way to do this be to
<br>
construct a universe in which thinking more is
<br>
easier and find a way to transport oneself to it?
<br>
All ETI thinking to date has placed an emphasis
<br>
on the idea that this universe is it (&quot;there
<br>
can be only one&quot;) and yet the theorists now seem
<br>
to be leaning in the direction that that just isn't so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The ultimate limit of computability

</em><br>
<p>Spike, we may need to have a serious discussion about
<br>
reversible computing.  I believe it may be Landauer
<br>
who showed communication may be &quot;free&quot; and Bennet
<br>
that showed computation may be &quot;free&quot; (please Anders,
<br>
Eliezer or others correct me if this is wrong).  If
<br>
my understanding is correct then one does *not* need the
<br>
photons (in other than a general way that there is
<br>
heat present in the universe).
<br>
<p>I also suspect I could come up with multiple schemes whereby
<br>
the energy of single photons (at least those in the UV-visible
<br>
range) could be used to flip multiple bits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the AI wants to get smarter.
</em><br>
<p>Not completely clear.  The AI might want to maximize its
<br>
longevity and that might require exiting this universe.
<br>
The AI might want to be known as the most brilliant AI
<br>
that ever existed -- so it is going to transmit the
<br>
most brilliant intellectual result ever created in
<br>
the history of the universe as it hurls itself
<br>
(and a whole lot of other matter) into a black hole
<br>
to generate the energy required to produce the
<br>
computational result.  So what that it doesn't
<br>
survive, it is reknowned throughout the galaxy
<br>
as being the most brilliant.  The AI might want to
<br>
maximize its &quot;fun&quot; in which case it may live fast,
<br>
die young and leave a pretty corpse (this is why I
<br>
agree with Eli that we need a better &quot;fun&quot; theory.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This line of reasoning is sounding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more inevitable the more I think about it.
</em><br>
<p>Without meaning to sound too harsh we need to think
<br>
*more* about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can see a post-Spike (or post-Singularity) humanity getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the point of wanting to stop all the wastful photon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; barfing within a few hundred years, and actually starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in some meaningful way to deal with that waste within 5000.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with the &quot;few hundred years&quot; figure (or even less).
<br>
The dealing with the waste issue involves critical questions
<br>
about the &quot;present value&quot; of thought.  Is somewhat more
<br>
thought now better than an even greater amount of thought later?
<br>
<p>I believe the current concepts of the Spike or the Singularity
<br>
may be incomplete.
<br>
<p>Reasoning:
<br>
- How *long* do you want to be able to think?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[Reversible computing work seems to suggest that one can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;think much longer if one is willing to think slower.]
<br>
- How much do you want to be able to think about?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[If faster thinking allows one to get out of what may
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be a doomed universe then it is worth it -- but if it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't then it may have been resources ill spent.]
<br>
- How much are you willing to sacrifice if thinking more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or longer requires that you leave a significant amount
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;behind if you have to travel to another universe to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;continue thinking?
<br>
<p>etc.
<br>
<p>I think the ETI thinking may have largely been dominated
<br>
by Dysonian or Tiplerian thinking that there may be ways
<br>
out of the quagmire (a doomed universe).  But what if
<br>
Adams and Laughlin (The Five Ages of the Universe) are
<br>
right and no matter what we do in the current paradigm
<br>
we are ultimately hosed?  Then there isn't any f***ing
<br>
point to colonization -- ultimately it is a pointless
<br>
exercise.
<br>
<p>I'd also lean towards asserting that a species capable
<br>
of interstellar colonization is probably relatively
<br>
capable of knowing whether this universe is doomed.
<br>
