<br>
<p>How many ants, harnessed by carbon nanofibres would it take to make the

<em>&gt; the event will be held at the New York Marriott Financial Center in New York
</em><br>
<em>&gt; City, from May 11-13, and is designed to drive forward the emerging business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of microsystems and nanotechnology. Complete information and online

<em>&gt; Advances pave way for 'nanobots'. Despite tantalizing lab results, building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robots on a molecular scale would seem to be a futuristic pipe dream. But a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research report on robotic technology published by Business Communications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Co. Inc. (Norwalk, Conn.) claims that nanobots are &quot;on the cusp,&quot; thanks to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robust research worldwide on the problem. (EETimes 4/28/03)

<em>&gt; Companies bring war to nanoscale to combat unseen bio/chem enemies. One of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the many take-home lessons for the United States and its allies after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1991 Persian Gulf War was a need for better protection against biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and chemical weapons. Years after the conflict, soldiers complained of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ailments they believed resulted from exposure to the Iraqi regime's arsenal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More than a decade later, several companies are turning to nanotechnology to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counter the threats of biological and chemical warfare. Their efforts range
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from gloves and gear that block out toxic chemicals and germs to fabrics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powders that deactivate and destroy the deadly agents. Military and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; university research labs also are developing protective skin creams,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emulsions and even drugs to reduce the dangers. (Small Times 5/8/03)
