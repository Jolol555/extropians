<em>&gt; &gt; Interesting alternate history scenario. I found it amusing anyway.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish I didn't agree with you.  Gore would have been much more polite

<em>&gt; about things,
</em><br>
<p>to other nations, I think you mean.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but many of the contracts seem to have been let before the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant it would have been.  My general impression is
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; own power.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all!  Political parties by their very nature do
<br>
everything that they can &quot;to be liked&quot;, especially on
<br>
election day.  Just apply a little Darwinian logic, and
<br>
see what would happen to parties that didn't care if
<br>
they were liked!
<br>
<p>But yes; there is something disturbingly feminine about
<br>
Democratic approaches to foreign policy and masculine
<br>
about Republican approaches.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Still, one must bear in mind that a (small) group in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control of power will almost always decide on actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that retain its control over the power, however it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may have to justify them to itself.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That said, Gore appeared from the first to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;chosen loser&quot; [each of these is spelled with just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one &quot;o&quot;] in the election (bland, unemotional, unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to motivate people).
</em><br>
<p>Well, he only failed by a hair.  I'd say in roughly
<br>
half the worlds it *is* &quot;President Gore&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And he was as fervently in favor of increased centralized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence gathering and surveillance as Bush was.  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more so.  He was pushing that during Clinton's term.  Still,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I got the impression that everyone was surprised as how hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was to get Bush chosen.  (Why they wanted to is still a puzzle.)
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I don't understand the depth of your puzzle.  For
<br>
me, it was simple:  the Republicans badly needed a cynosure,
<br>
or a Shelling point, whatever, that they knew that they could
<br>
all rally around.  Despite his appalling inarticulateness (which
<br>
I guess has improved), he was the clear choice that would
<br>
provide the best chance of beating those awful Democrats.
<br>
And that's the only reason he was chosen.  Am I missing
<br>
something?
