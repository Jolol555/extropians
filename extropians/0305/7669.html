</em><br>
<p>I am sure that some would like to think so, however I will note that
<br>
Tony Blair, a 'leftist' PM, received unanimous support from the Tories
<br>
and only a majority of support from his own party for this war.
<br>
<p>The real opposition to Clinton's military adventures by the right was
<br>
that:
<br>
a) as a draft dodger and anti-war protester, he didn't have the moral
<br>
mandate to lead the armed forces. Al Gore at least enlisted, went to
<br>
Vietnam, and whether he had a personal bodyguard as a private or not,
<br>
he at least served in a position of some risk. I don't think there
<br>
would be as much opposition among the armed services to a President Al
<br>
vs Clinton. The only smear on his record was that he was VP under the
<br>
serial-rapist-in-chief, which brings us to (b),
<br>
b) Clinton's military adventures seemed to be timed to coincide with
<br>
his various scandals as tactics of deflection, as well as,
<br>
c) He hamstrung our armed forces when they were in action with
<br>
Vietnam-like rules of engagement, and,
<br>
d) He hamstrung our armed forces with budget cuts that cut training,
<br>
education, pay, as well as ammo and weapons.
<br>
e) His military adventures were usually involved in areas which the US
<br>
had no national self interest, while he purposely ignored the fact that
<br>
al Qaeda had declared war on the US in 1993, because measures to fight
<br>
a war against terrorism would offend the liberal sensibilities of his
<br>
own party.
<br>
<p>I don't think that a President Gore would enjoy nearly the same level
<br>
of support among the armed forces that Dubya does, but I don't think
<br>
he'd have a lot of problems with them, so long as none of his white
<br>
house staff called any Congressional Medal of Honor recipients &quot;Baby
<br>
killers&quot;, as occured in the Clinton Administration.
<br>
He would certainly feel the need to demonstrate his military prowess
<br>
more, but would also likely hobble the men with more rules of
<br>
engagement. His staff would quite likely be micromanaging General
<br>
Franks on a constant basis.
