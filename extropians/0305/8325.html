<p><em>&gt;  I think the very way you are posing the question tips the playing

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That's quite correct. It is unfair. On the one hand, we have the 
<br>
if-I-were-king mode as a legitimate and fruitful discussion style on 
<br>
this list. This is where we can discuss things like 'I think I can prove 
<br>
the many-worlds interpretation of QM is correct, via torturing children 
<br>
for millenia. Here's how...'. In this mode I can agree with many of the 
<br>
reasons for attacking Iraq.
<br>
<p>But, discussions of torturing children for millenia (yes, there's been a 
<br>
few) are considered mind experiments. We all know, (except maybe the 
<br>
psychopaths), that the experiment won't be done in the real world.
<br>
<p>Attacking Iraq is/was a different story. It actually happened. The U.S. 
<br>
launched an aggressive war that was not necessary. The consequences of 
<br>
that may well affect our entire lives. (a friend (call him R) wrote me 
<br>
about the possible financial consequences, having obtained his 
<br>
permission, I'll quote some of it here: )
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The dollar is in the second day of a free fall against the euro, yen 
<br>
and canadian loonie. Our money is worth something like 5% less than it 
<br>
was sunday - in other countries that is.
<br>
<p>Gold did spike today - up almost $5. People outside the US with a lot of 
<br>
money are retreating from using the dollar as their holding currency in 
<br>
earnest. Look for the plunge to accelerate, as the currency markets are 
<br>
trend driven and tend to over-adjust.
<br>
<p>This is it. The big one. It should drive the derivatives market into 
<br>
whatever it does when it collapses, and also make the trade deficit and 
<br>
national deficit unserviceable. They are taking us down. The world is 
<br>
taking us down - even though they will by and large sink with us. That 
<br>
is how bad we scared the world with our preemptive empire building. They 
<br>
are willing to deal with the consequences of global financial collapse 
<br>
before they are willing to be part of the American empire.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Another friend (S) recently sent a few thousand dollars to her family in 
<br>
Brazil. In the space of a few days the value of this, when converted to 
<br>
Brazillian currency, plummeted. I dunno the exact amount, S claims they 
<br>
lost about a third.
<br>
<p>A followup R quote:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Better charts are available on <a href="http://quote.fxtrek.com/misc/fxcm2.asp">http://quote.fxtrek.com/misc/fxcm2.asp</a>
<br>
<p>Looking at the ten year chart, you will see that the dollar hit a 
<br>
five-year low against the Canadian loonie today. Considering that the 
<br>
dollar hit an all time high against the loonie only a couple of months 
<br>
ago, the chart looks a lot like a free-fall. Five years gains wiped out 
<br>
in less than two months.
<br>
symbol USD/CAN - Daily ticks/10 year span
<br>
<p>USD/EUR is at a four-year low. It has gone from 84 cents per Euro to 
<br>
1.12 per Euro in fourteen months. About a 28% drop.
<br>
<p>Not that this is all bad since American labor and products are quickly 
<br>
becoming more affordable around the world.
<br>
<p>But the short of it is - and I'll say it here first - We are now living 
<br>
in an EX-only-superpower. It is done, but will take years to sink in.
<br>
<p>America. Armed to the teeth, piss broke.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Note that I don't necessarily agree with R, nor do I follow currency 
<br>
exchange rates. I suspect R may be biased in favor of gloom-and-doom 
<br>
scenarios, yet I do have respect for his study in this area.
