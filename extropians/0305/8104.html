<em>&gt; I have to contest this. Cooking of foods dates back several

</em><br>
<p>Actually cooking almost certainly dates back further than 10-20 thousand
<br>
years, but in any case cooking is still recent relative to the ~4 million
<br>
year history of hominids. 
<br>
<p>If moderns were fully adapted to cooked foods then we would be fully adapted
<br>
to Advanced Glycation End-products (AGE's) and heterocyclic amines (HCA's),
<br>
both of which are produced when cooking meat at high temperature. The former
<br>
are implicated in many diseases and the latter are thought by some
<br>
researchers to be carcinogenic. 
<br>
<p>Life Extension Magazine ran an article this month about the dangers of AGE's
<br>
from cooked meats. See the thread called &quot;eating glycotoxins&quot; started a
<br>
couple of days ago by Brian. 
<br>
<p>Probably the bad effects of these compounds don't show up until late in
<br>
life, such that early consumers of cooked foods did not suffer the bad
<br>
effects due to their shorter life-expectancies. However long-lived moderns
<br>
like us are now faced with the consequences of eating these substances from
<br>
cooked foods to which we are not well adapted.
