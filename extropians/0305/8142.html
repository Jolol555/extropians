See my previous post:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0305/8069.html">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0305/8069.html</a>
<br>
<p>I note that today the news comes out that a coverup
<br>
was also going on in Taiwan, which may be directly
<br>
responsible for the breakout of SARS therer, esulting
<br>
in the dismissal of a high-ranking medical
<br>
authority...  Same culture, same behavior.
<br>
<p><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/sars/story/0,4395,188695,00.html">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/sars/story/0,4395,188695,00.html</a>
<br>
<p>As an aside, a lot of people think of Taiwan as being
<br>
the champions of freedom and capitalist, Western
<br>
values, a lonely, brave outpost facing up to the
<br>
mainland monster.  Many Taiwanese may even hold a
<br>
similar view.  However, from the &quot;36 Strategies&quot; and
<br>
the &quot;Art of War,&quot; we learn that rarely are things as
<br>
they seem in the political/economic/military complex
<br>
of Chinese culture - mainland or Formosan.  
<br>
<p>If you want to get concessions from the U.S., just
<br>
threaten Taiwan or arrest a bunch of harmless Falun
<br>
Gong.  The mainland Chinese see Taiwan clearly as a
<br>
piece on a chess board that is off by itself
<br>
unprotected.  The U.S. has gallantly stepped in to
<br>
protect it?  Wonderful!  So much more difficult if one
<br>
had to threaten the U.S. directly.   
<br>
<p>Hey, U.S. dummies!  Next time why not just put a few
<br>
million innocent people out in the ocean off our coast
<br>
and then offer to &quot;protect&quot; them.  How much we have to
<br>
pay you, U.S. dummies?
<br>
<p>In trouble over intellectual property theft?  Hey,
<br>
look at us about to invade Taiwan!  (Yeah, right...
<br>
And destroy their biggest trading point with the U.S.?
<br>
&nbsp;If China invaded Taiwan, they couldn't use it any
<br>
more to twist the U.S. arm.)
<br>
<p>As far as being champions of freedom, the history of
<br>
Taiwan does not exactly lend itself to that
<br>
interpretation.  Chang Kai Shek was a warlord who is
<br>
alleged by many non-Chinese analysts to have been
<br>
responsible for perhaps hundreds of thousands of
<br>
unnecessary civilian deaths.  His army was notorious
<br>
for its brutality and corruption while they fought on
<br>
the mainland.  In fact, they effectively GAVE China to
<br>
the commies by turning the whole countryside against
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>When they went to Taiwan and just moved in and started
<br>
seizing everything in sight, normal behavior for them,
<br>
the unarmed Taiwanese protested publically, to which
<br>
Chang's army responded by killing 20,000 of the
<br>
unarmed protestors, as a lesson.
<br>
<p>Now, of course, they are good guys...  
<br>
<p>And if you believe that...
