</em><br>
<p>I don't see where you are disagreeing with anything I wrote above, or why
<br>
you believe that 
<br>
anything I wrote was &quot;oversimplified.&quot; 
<br>
<p>You wrote &quot;But I think the second part is oversimplified. Raising HDL is not
<br>
necessarily good
<br>
by itself. If LDL is not kept even, but increases as well, then the ratio is
<br>
not improved.&quot; 
<br>
But that statement has exactly the same meaning as mine: &quot;any increase in
<br>
HDL/LDL is a good 
<br>
thing even if LDL does not decline.&quot; Maybe you didn't realize that I was
<br>
referring to HDL/LDL 
<br>
as a ratio.
<br>
<p>I added a caveat: that total cholesterol should not be allowed rise
<br>
significantly above
<br>
~200. I can't say for sure that a rise above ~200 is unhealthy when the rise
<br>
comes only from a rise in the healthy HDL component of cholesterol, but I
<br>
would not bet my life that it's healthy. As far as I know there is not
<br>
enough data about the benefits of HDL to think extremely high HDL sufficient
<br>
to push total cholesterol significantly above 200 is healthy. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I remain convinced that extremely low-fat diets are unhealthy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I totally agree. 
</em><br>
<p>I worry though that many vegetarian diets are too low in fat. The low-fat
<br>
diet described in that abstract which showed a negative effect on HDL was
<br>
still something like 24% of calories from fat. That seems to be within range
<br>
of the typical vegetarian diet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the only place where we would disagree on fats is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I believe in a certain ratio of fats which prefers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential fatty acids &gt; monounsaturated &gt; polyunsaturated &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saturated &gt; hydrogenised.  I am not sure if you have no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preference between different kinds of fats, or if you prefer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reverse order than I do. 
</em><br>
<p>I certainly don't prefer a reverse order! In fact I strive to avoid
<br>
hydrogenised fats altogether.
