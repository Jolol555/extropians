<p>If that is so, then I'm applauding. But other GMs have had the opposite

<p><em>&gt; You are spouting the (green) party line and on this list that isn't

</em><br>
<p>I probably shouldn't have answered an email in which I am accused of
<br>
&quot;spouting&quot; ... but here I am. Anyway, spouting the Monsanto company line -
<br>
even with scientific research paid for by Monsanto, surprisingly in
<br>
Monsanto's favor - won't get you very far with *me* :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Citations *please*?
</em><br>
<p>For using disease genes and antibiotic resistance markers? As someone else
<br>
told me on this list, go ask Google. It's pretty basic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Organic food certification is simply a way to allow small-farm and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government subsidized farms (in Europe) farmers to compete against large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farms that have mass production advantages.  Its health benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are marginal if any.
</em><br>
<p>Umm, you *do* realize organic foods are certified in the U.S., don't you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example -- go find some statistics that state that &quot;organic&quot; peanuts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have less aflatoxin than &quot;non-organic&quot; peanuts.  Aflatoxin is a known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carcinogen produced by fungi that grow on peanuts -- it is known to cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutations in the p53 gene that lead to cancer.  The amount one ingests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is regulated by food safety regulations -- but clearly less would be better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The amount one ingests has little or nothing to do with how the peanuts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are grown and a lot to do with how they are stored.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That isn't a GM/organic debate -- its a food processing (cost) debate.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's another debate. But it's a different one than the debate over
<br>
GM foods versus non-GM foods. 
<br>
<p>Again, I believe GM had great potential, and I support it in theory. But
<br>
as applied, it decided to ignore health, safety, and public opinion and so
<br>
sabotaged its own technology. Not that the poison manufacturers haven't
<br>
made their steep, short-term profits. GM could have enabled greater
<br>
implementation of organic food production. Instead, it's ended up being
<br>
excluded from organic labeling.
