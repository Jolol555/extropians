<p>I don't believe it was ever reduced to that extreme extent.  Voices 
<br>
on both sides could not easily be so pigeon-holed.   I didn't oppose 
<br>
the invasion on grounds of pacifism but on ground that it was an 
<br>
unjustified, dangerous, costly and highly destabilizing thing to do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is normal primate politics, and one shouldn't expect anything

<em>&gt; If you really want to get away from this, you need to insist that
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentality to emerge...which tends to put an end to rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument on any of the features which are dogma to the dominant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group.  A nice thing about mailing lists is that one has an easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance to observe this in a non-costly environment.
</em><br>
<p><p>Some decisions are binary on at least there surface.  Should we 
<br>
invade/have invaded Iraq?  Yes or No?  Why is a much more complex 
<br>
question to ask and answer.   I don't think it is a manner of the 
<br>
number of choices but of the quality of the thinking and explanations 
<br>
involved and most importantly of keeping enough respect/civility to 
<br>
listen to one another.    
<br>
<p>I don't get the bit about needing to adopt an agenda/platform to back 
<br>
one's decision on a question.   I do not do so but only attempt to 
<br>
choose among alternatives with what information, thinking and values 
<br>
I can manage to bring to bear.   Perhaps I am naive to assume this is 
<br>
true of most people here.
