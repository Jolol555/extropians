I know this is a natural object, but I like to imagine that scientists have 
<br>
mis-identified an ETI phenomena. Hey, it floats my boat.

<br>
Jet Propulsion Lab -- The great sculptor gravity ensures that larger, denser 
<br>
objects in the universe -- like stars, planets and moons -- take on the 
<br>
familiar spherical shape. 
<br>
<p>Occasionally, though, an interplay of mysterious cosmic forces leaves objects 
<br>
outside the round, those with more geometrically curious forms. One such 
<br>
object, discovered in 1975, is the Red Rectangle. 
<br>
<p><p><p>Now astronomers Dr. Raghvendra Sahai of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
<br>
Pasadena, Calif., and Dr. Carmen Sanchez Contreras of the California Institute of 
<br>
Technology, also in Pasadena, have uncovered a physical mechanism that might 
<br>
support this bizarre red rectangular structure. 
<br>
<p><p><p>They report their findings in a paper titled &quot;A Very Young, Fast, Bipolar 
<br>
Outflow at the Center of the Red Rectangle&quot; at the 2003 summer meeting of the 
<br>
American Astronomical Society, being held this week in Nashville, Tennessee. 
<br>
<p><p><p>A protoplanetary nebula forms when a red giant star ejects most of its outer 
<br>
layers, and is observable when dust within the nebula reflects light from the 
<br>
central star. 
<br>
<p><p>Subsequently, as the very hot core (six or more times hotter than the Sun) 
<br>
gets further exposed, the cloud of ejected material becomes bathed with ionizing 
<br>
ultraviolet light, which makes it glow. At this later stage these objects are 
<br>
known as planetary nebulas. 
<br>
<p><p><p>The Red Rectangle, or HD44179, represents the crimson light from a 
<br>
protoplanetary nebula that lurks about 1,000 light years from Earth. Images taken with 
<br>
the sharp eyes of the Hubble Space Telescope show that two bright diagonals 
<br>
intersect its roughly rectangular shape; the diagonals appear connected by s
<br>
traight lines parallel to the short side of the rectangle. 
<br>
<p><p><p>Coming up with a physical mechanism to produce these oddly shaped nebulas, 
<br>
and the Red Rectangle in particular, has been a serious challenge for 
<br>
astronomers. Many recent studies of such objects with the Hubble have led to a new model 
<br>
by Sahai in which very fast jet-like outflows carve out these diverse shapes. 
<br>
<p><p><p><p>The jets are thought to operate for a very short period of time -- only a few 
<br>
hundred or so years -- during the protoplanetary phase, making studies of 
<br>
protoplanetary nebulas very important for understanding the nature and origin of 
<br>
the jets. 
<br>
<p><p><p>Finding direct evidence for these jet-like outflows has been generally very 
<br>
difficult, because they are compact, occasionally dormant, and difficult to see 
<br>
against the bright nebular background. 
<br>
<p><p><p>Fortunately, the Hubble's imaging spectrograph provides a way to discriminate 
<br>
these outflows by separating the nebular light into its constituent colors 
<br>
(like a prism revealing the rainbow of colors in sunlight). 
<br>
<p><p><p>The violent interaction of these outflows with the surrounding dense nebular 
<br>
gas causes hydrogen atoms in the outflow (but not the general nebula) to emit 
<br>
light at a specific wavelength (called H-alpha radiation) that is detected by 
<br>
the imaging spectrograph. 
<br>
<p><p><p>A small deviation, or shift, in the measured wavelength from the laboratory 
<br>
value allows researchers to find out how fast, and in which direction (i.e. 
<br>
towards or away from the observer), the material in the high-speed outflow moves. 
<br>
<p><p><p><p>After examining archival data on the Red Rectangle, Sahai and Sanchez 
<br>
Contreras have found evidence of H-alpha radiation emitted by a fast outflow 
<br>
expanding with a speed of about 65 kilometers per second (40 miles per second). This 
<br>
is the first time this inner, bipolar outflow has been seen in this object. 
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;Discovering this outflow in the famous, yet mysterious Red Rectangle is very 
<br>
exciting because it provides us an unprecedented opportunity to study the 
<br>
fast outflows believed to shape such objects,&quot; said Sahai. “The outflow is very 
<br>
young and its innermost parts are only a few years old, so we will be able to 
<br>
directly observe if, and how, it changes with time.&quot; 
<br>
<p><p><p>One theory about the formation of such fast outflows requires the central 
<br>
star to have a close companion object. Strong evidence exists that the central 
<br>
star in the Red Rectangle has such a companion. 
<br>
<p><p><p>A full understanding of this outflow and how it supports the intriguing shape 
<br>
of the Red Rectangle will require further observations and detailed computer 
<br>
modeling. 
<br>
<p><p><p>The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph is managed by NASA's Goddard Space 
<br>
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The Hubble Space Telescope is a project 
<br>
of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency.
