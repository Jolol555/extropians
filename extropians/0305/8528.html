In reply to Samantha's typically silly post:
<br>
<p>I can't even figure out what your interpretation is of
<br>
what I said, so this is going to likely fall short of
<br>
a cogent response on those grounds.  &quot;Real Woman&quot; as
<br>
opposed to MALE!!! transexual prostitutes?  I didn't
<br>
imply anything about transexual Women, I don't think. 
<br>
These prostitutes, who are quite common in your real
<br>
low-life Mexican bars, are completely biologically
<br>
male, I'm reasonable sure.  As I mentioned, an entire
<br>
radio program - an hour, as I recall - was devoted
<br>
locally on the Pacifica station to describing the
<br>
increasing problem of Hispanic men passing AIDS and
<br>
other STDs to their wives from encounters with such
<br>
prostitutes.
<br>
<p>Many, perhaps most traditional macho Hispanic men are
<br>
only homophobic about being on the &quot;receiving&quot; end -
<br>
i.e., taking on the &quot;female&quot; role.  Taking the &quot;male&quot;
<br>
role with another man is not considered a diminishment
<br>
of one's machismo.  It can even be seen as a superior
<br>
way of proving it, as women are seen in that male
<br>
culture as being inherently weak and essentially &quot;no
<br>
contest.&quot;  Thus, forcing another man to act like a
<br>
female means that one is even that much more macho. 
<br>
On numerous occasions, in fact, because I had very
<br>
smooth facial skin (due to using retin A for a decade)
<br>
and longish hair, I had the experience of Hispanic
<br>
passengers in my cab suddenly coming on to me, at
<br>
which point I politely made it clear that I was not
<br>
one of those men who would take on the female role for
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>I'm sure that there are biological males - in the
<br>
limited XY sense, at least - who, because of some
<br>
pre-natal gender hormone misshap or other similar
<br>
causes, find that their responses fit the pattern of
<br>
woman to man and make the choice to follow that
<br>
pattern, whether including hormone treatments and/or
<br>
surgery.  At least one of them has been a friend of
<br>
mine since the mid-80's.  I suspect that many of these
<br>
Hispanic transexuals also fit that pattern.  However,
<br>
in the U.S., in Orange County, at least, I rarely saw
<br>
a female Hispanic prostitute, altho they dominate in
<br>
Mexico for sure.  With a limited supply, I'm sure that
<br>
the prices for those rare women are quite high, which
<br>
leaves the transexual prostitutes, who, unfortunately,
<br>
tend to practice unsafe sex with a LOT of partners.
<br>
<p>Does wearing a skirt and bra make one a REAL woman? 
<br>
Just where is that line?

<p><em>&gt; Purely anecdotally, one of the Hispanics who I see

he got caught cheating on his wife, by his wife, after
<br>
she came down with an STD. When I drove a cab here in
<br>
Orange County in the '80's, 90% of my customers were
<br>
first-generation, low-income Hispanics, and couldn't
<br>
afford a real woman to prove their manhood, so the
<br>
trans-sexual prostitutes did a land office business at
<br>
the bars. I carried them as well, and often they were
<br>
indistinguishable from a real woman at first glance. &gt;
<br>
<p>So now you are going to bash transsexual women as not
<br>
&quot;real women&quot; to boot heh? I will refrain from
<br>
responding further to you, ever, as 
<br>
I will become decidely un-lady-like. 
<br>
<p>Culturally Hispanics are generally homophobic and most
<br>
hispanic males would not consider sex with anyone they
<br>
thought of as less than a woman or not really a woman
<br>
as proving anything at all complementary about
<br>
themselves. Perhaps they exhibit a better attitude
<br>
than you 
<br>
do in this respect.
