<p>You wanted evidence for &quot;a move in that

are
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree of course that our intellectual progress accelerated dramatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when we settled into complex farming societies. I just wanted to make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear that this was only an escalation of a process that started long
</em><br>
before
<br>
<em>&gt; the advent of agriculture. We cannot thank agriculture for the ability to
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; math and write language. We can thank it only for adding more selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressure to the development of these traits that were already under
</em><br>
pressure
<br>
<em>&gt; for development anyway. There is no reason to think we would not have made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to this level eventually even had we never learned to plant seeds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Farming only got us here faster.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We humans are, by nature, curious about the world. This trait of curiosity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is I think at the root of intellectual progress. Farming did not make us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curious. It only made us fat. :)

<p>I think this is right. The consequences of agriculture, good and bad, are
<br>
ultimately the consequences of having a larger (and denser) population. Our
<br>
nature clearly didn't change. We actually know very little about the way of
<br>
life of our paleolithic ancestors because of the lack of sources. We need to
<br>
be vary wary about the kind of argument that says &quot;this is what
<br>
hunter-gatherers are like now, so that is how our ancestors lived&quot;. All
<br>
sorts of things wrong with that.
