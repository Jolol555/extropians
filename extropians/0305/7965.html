&lt;&lt;Unless they were very likely to cause the expansion of more
<br>
domains like that... hey! Quite possibly a good way out of the
<br>
conundrum of the essay is that such cascades of baby universes are
<br>
very common, manageing to crowd out the natural expansion-creation
<br>
cycle that makes most domains miraculous. If the likeliehood of an
<br>
inhabited domain inducing inflation was higher than the
<br>
spontaneous fluctuations and the resulting domain also shared this
<br>
property, then these would rapidly come to dominate the set of
<br>
worlds. And that would make most worlds non-miraculous!&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Sounds like Edward Harrison's &quot;angels&quot; messing with reality as they travel 
<br>
back through time and such. It also remind me of directed evolution which has 
<br>
been the premise of the creationists.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Anybody feeling for writing a paper analysing this?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Those who may be qualified to write of such matters seem reluctant to set 
<br>
them in print. A lot of physicists seem unwilling to get into philosophy, and 
<br>
not that many philosophers are willing to elaborate on physics. 
<br>
Neuroscientists, such as yourself are welcome, and perhaps more likely to 
<br>
produce useful results as life-scientists seem to be leading the way in 
<br>
cutting-edge thinking.
