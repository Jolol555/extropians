</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the problems I have with Michael Huemer's points---although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreeing that this paper is very good and on the whole makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valuable points---is when he writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       In one psychological study, subjects were exposed to evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       concerning the deterrent effect of capital punishment.  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       study had concluded that capital punishment has a deterrent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       effect; another had concluded that it does not. All experimental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       subjects were provided with summaries of both studies, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       asked to assess which conclusion the evidence they had just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       looked at most supported, overall. The result was that those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       who initially supported capital punishment claimed that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       evidence they'd been shown, overall, supported that capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       punishment has a deterrent effect. Those who initially opposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       capital punishment thought, instead, that this same evidence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       overall, supported that capital punishment had no deterrent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       effect.  In each case, partisans came up with reasons (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       rationalizations) for why the study whose conclusion they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       agreed with was methodologically superior to the other study.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       This points up one reason why people tend to become polarized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       (sc., to adopt very strong beliefs on a particular side) about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       political issues: we tend to evaluate mixed evidence as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       supporting whichever belief we already incline towards---
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       whereupon we increase our degree of belief.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that everything he has said here is true; I simply don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that evolution erred to make us this way.  But first of all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a point about PCR (Pat-Critical Rationalism).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It must be held in mind that mixed evidence DOES NOT knock down a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief!  Mixed evidence does not refute anything, and a conjecture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjected to only &quot;mixed evidence&quot; survives the criticism, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unscathed.  So therefore it is in the nature of how our learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take place---through conjecture and refutation---that this tendency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within us arises.  And so far as we know (considering the absence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of other beings who think a lot different from us), this is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing.
</em><br>
<p>Well, several points can't be made here.  One, are these people using
<br>
PCR in belief selection?  I doubt it very much.  In fact, few people use
<br>
PCR.  I don't see PCR as the natural process of belief selection for
<br>
most people on either a personal or a social level.
<br>
<p>Two, PCR is self-refuting -- at least in its all encompassing form.  If
<br>
there's any diluted form, then that is not really pancritical.:)  See my
<br>
&quot;Comments on Pancritical Rationalism&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/PCR.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/PCR.html</a>
<br>
<p>Third, Huemer stated:
<br>
<p>&quot;The result was that those who initially supported capital punishment
<br>
claimed that the evidence they'd been shown, overall, supported that
<br>
capital punishment has a deterrent effect. Those who initially opposed
<br>
capital punishment thought, instead, that this same evidence, overall,
<br>
supported that capital punishment had no deterrent effect.  In each
<br>
case, partisans came up with reasons (or rationalizations) for why the
<br>
study whose conclusion they agreed with was methodologically superior to
<br>
the other study.&quot;
<br>
<p>From this passage, we can see he's not talking about people working from
<br>
&quot;mixed evidence,&quot; but people throwing out some of the evidence.  Some go
<br>
with the evidence because it supports their prejudices, others disregard
<br>
it because it goes against theirs.  The selection method here is not
<br>
PCR, but ideology.  In other words, X believes B, so he looks for
<br>
evidence for B and ignores or explains away evidence against B, while Y
<br>
believes non-B and looks for evidence against B and ignores or explains
<br>
away evidence for B.
<br>
<p>Now, you might come back and state that there's a threshold here.  The
<br>
staunchest supporter of B will eventually cave when enough evidence is
<br>
presented against it.  Likewise, the staunchest opponent of B will
<br>
change her mind when enough eviendence is presented for it.  If that
<br>
were the case, then why irrationality at all?  Why religious beliefs?
<br>
Why ideologues?  (I freely admit to being called one, but in my defense,
<br>
an ideologue is always the other guy -- not me.:)
<br>
<p>Also, again, this proves my point about PCR not being behind these
<br>
people's thinking.  If it were, the goal would be to engage in debate
<br>
not to persuade so much as to find the truth.  (While I believe PCR is
<br>
self-refuting, I generally agree with the motivations of PCR
<br>
supporters.)  Instead, what justifications for political beliefs usually
<br>
look like is just versions of the 10 leaky buckets arguments -- i.e.,
<br>
people use cardstack, use non sequitirs, etc. hoping that all these
<br>
illogical strategies lumped together add up to a logical argument.
<br>
<p>Finally, I think you mean &quot;pancritical rationalism&quot; -- not &quot;Pat-Critical
<br>
Rationalism.&quot;  If this has something to do with Pat's rationalism, then
<br>
I withdraw my previous comments.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
