Sceptics denounce climate science 'lie'
<br>
By Alex KirbyBBC News Online environment correspondent . A group of 
<br>
scientists in the US and the UK says the accepted wisdom on
<br>
climate change remains unproved.
<br>
They say rising greenhouse gas emissions may not be the main factor in
<br>
global warming.
<br>
They argue that temperature rise projections this century are &quot;unknown and
<br>
unknowable&quot;.They claim it is &quot;a media myth&quot; to suppose that only a few 
<br>
scientists share
<br>
their scepticism.
<br>
The scientists, a group convened by the American George C. Marshall
<br>
Institute, first published their report in the US.
<br>
'Political conclusions' It has been republished in the UK by the European 
<br>
Science and Environment
<br>
Forum (Esef), entitled Climate Science and Policy: Making the Connection.
<br>
Esef says it is &quot;the result of an extensive review by a distinguished group
<br>
of scientists and public policy experts of the science behind recent
<br>
findings of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
<br>
(IPCC)&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;
<br>
The US group included a former CIA director and defence secretary, 
<br>
JamesSchlesinger, and Richard Lindzen, professor of meteorology at 
<br>
Massachusetts
<br>
Institute of Technology.
<br>
The report says the IPCC's conclusions &quot;have become politicised and fail to
<br>
convey the underlying uncertainties that are important in policy
<br>
considerations.&quot;
<br>
Its detailed criticisms of the IPCC include:
<br>
* projections of climate change based on models and assumptions which &quot;are
<br>
not only unknown, but unknowable within ranges relevant for policy-making&quot;
<br>
* models which &quot;do not adequately characterise clouds, water vapour,
<br>
aerosols, ocean currents and solar effects&quot;
<br>
* a failure &quot;to reproduce the difference in trends between the lower
<br>
troposphere and surface temperatures over the past 20 years&quot;.
<br>
The authors conclude: &quot;The IPCC simulation of surface temperature appears to
<br>
be little more than a fortuitous bit of curve-fitting rather than any
<br>
genuine demonstration of human influence on global climate.&quot;
<br>
Accused of lying
<br>
Philip Stott, emeritus professor of biogeography in the University of
<br>
London, is a prominent British climate sceptic.&lt;BR&gt;
<br>
He said: &quot;The authors challenge the key contradiction at the heart of the
<br>
Kyoto Protocol, the global climate agreement - that climate is one of the
<br>
most complex systems known, yet that we can manage it by trying to control a
<br>
small set of factors, namely greenhouse gas emissions. Scientifically, this
<br>
is not mere uncertainty: it is a lie.&quot;
<br>
Professor Stott told BBC News Online: &quot;The problem with a chaotic coupled
<br>
non-linear system as complex as climate is that you can no more predict
<br>
successfully the outcome of doing something as of not doing something. Kyoto
<br>
will not halt climate change. 
<br>
Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, used
<br>
to work at the State Department and helped to shape US climate policy.
<br>
Heavyweight backing
<br>
She told BBC News Online: &quot;This report dismisses the findings of the IPCC as
<br>
alarmist, yet they are widely accepted as representative of the current
<br>
state of scientific knowledge.
<br>
&quot;A panel of the US's own National Academy of Sciences (which included
<br>
Richard Lindzen) expressed general agreement with the IPCC's finding that
<br>
warming is occurring, and that it is at least partly caused by humans.
<br>
&quot;Uncertainty cuts both ways. Some of the IPCC's scenarios have been
<br>
criticized as unduly pessimistic, others as unduly optimistic.
<br>
&quot;What is important is that they reflect a balance of reasonable futures, and
<br>
that the scientific findings should be based on the peer-reviewed
<br>
literature. The IPCC has been able to accomplish exactly that.
<br>
&quot;And Kyoto was only intended to be a first step in a long journey.&quot;
