<br>
in particular, Ron, but can we all stop talking about The Left and The Right, 
<br>
now? It's worse than TV.
<br>
<p>James,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is strange that you bring my name up.  I'll bet that if you check 
<br>
the archives you will find I rarely start a political discussion -- perhaps 
<br>
never.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I can think of several of the threads on this list that 
<br>
extropians seem to support that interest me mightily.  However I do think 
<br>
politics are extremely important to our progress as Extropians.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that politics are so important that the people that start the 
<br>
political discussions cannot leave them alone.  When they start the advocacy 
<br>
of the positions that I think will halt progress then I respond.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have been noticing at all then you know that our President Bush 
<br>
has just ended his 2nd major campaign in foreign affairs.  Certain people 
<br>
that are against his policies cannot let the 2nd campaign end at this point.  
<br>
They come onto the list attempting to sell us on their viewpoint that we 
<br>
should not have undertaken that campaign.  I have responded to that position 
<br>
for various reasons.  But had they not begun their advocacy neither would I 
<br>
have done so.  Surely, you are not advocating that only one viewpoint be 
<br>
heard, are you?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James, I come from what was once a very political family.  Like most 
<br>
of my family of the last few generations I don't really enjoy politics even 
<br>
though I consider it very important.  So yes, if you can get the initiators 
<br>
to turn it off I will be happy to move on to more productive fields.  Frankly 
<br>
I resent the intrusion.
<br>
Ron H.
<br>
