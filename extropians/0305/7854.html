<em>&gt; That was me.  I was amazed and certainly pleased those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guys survived.  Shows the Iraqis generally didn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything against Americans.  That whole business about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole world being against America was all evidently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media-speak.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe because some people are pro-America and some people are anti-America?
<br>
Seriously, it is silly to argue about what &quot;the whole world&quot; believes.
<br>
Seeing things in black-or-white, all one way or the other is unrealistic and
<br>
dogmatic.  I don't know why humans have a tendency to reduce everything down
<br>
to absurd extremes, but we all do it.  Rationally, we must see the world as
<br>
it really is, and realize that there are combinations and subtleties.
<br>
<p>Does the world hate America?  Some people do for good reason.  Some people
<br>
do for no reason.  Some people love America for good reason.  Some people
<br>
love America with no reason.  Some people don't care.  Some people care too
<br>
much.  It is a complex combination of politics, histories, rationales and
<br>
dogmatic politics.
<br>
<p>This is why political discussions become useless extremist propaganda.  The
<br>
real world is almost never the way people with an agenda claim it is.  They
<br>
exaggerate their position because that is all they see.  They minimize any
<br>
opposing positions because they fear someone might choose differently.  They
<br>
refuse to even allow other positions, because they see this as a sign of
<br>
weakness.  In the end, the whole dispute becomes a fictional battleground
<br>
where most of it is virtual and almost none of it is real.  The real world
<br>
is ugly, crude, indefensible, and despicable compared to the glorified
<br>
rationalizations on all sides.  Everybody wants to choose one of these modes
<br>
to champion, and almost nobody wants to be left in the middle with a
<br>
complicated, ever-changing, barely comprehensible chaos that we call
<br>
reality.
<br>
<p>But there we are....
