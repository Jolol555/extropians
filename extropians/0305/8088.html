<p>There is no question in my mind that some of the people charged with 
<br>
intelligence were lying.  Some of the others may have been more 
<br>
guilty of simply believing what they wanted to hear.  But for making 
<br>
policy even that is inexcusable.   It is and always was crystal clear 
<br>
to me that we were not attacking Iraq for the stated reasons.  Far 
<br>
too much was said and done in a conniving, rhetorical and irrational 
<br>
fashion for the state reasons to be at all believable.  I was frankly 
<br>
amazed that so many bright people were taken in.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It may be that

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>In a democracy where the people or their represenatives are to vote 
<br>
on whether to go to war there should be no &quot;evidence&quot; that is that 
<br>
secret.  If we don't learn that lesson quickly we are in for much 
<br>
worse troubles domestically than 9/11. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (This applies to &quot;enemy combatants&quot; as well, now that dozens of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prisoners have been released from Guantanamo with no connection to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any crimes or war activity.  Secret evidence and hidden tribunals

</em><br>
<p>Dunno.  Apparently Americans will put up with this as Patriot, 
<br>
Patriot II and several trial balloons suggest subjecting citizens to 
<br>
loss of such rights.   If we don't stand up and yell our heads over 
<br>
such proposals then we certainly can't count on other nations to do 
<br>
the job for us.
