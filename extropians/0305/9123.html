### A Bayesian A who doesn't understand an issue will not claim he does
<br>
(i.e. his utterances will reflect his level of understanding), therefore
<br>
another Bayesian B can safely accept his statements. In fact, it is
<br>
precisely  in arguments where B has no priors at all, knows nothing
<br>
whatsoever, should B accept A's opinion immediately. In situations where
<br>
both A and B have some knowledge, but different opinions, they have to
<br>
assume they have different information about the issue, and proceed with
<br>
exchange of data before coming to a shared conclusion.
