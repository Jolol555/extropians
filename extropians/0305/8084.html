</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; True, but the &quot;low fat&quot; obsession is orthogonal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vegetarianism.  There are low-fat, high-fat, and other diets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in both the vegetarian and carnivorous realms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What does a high-fat vegetarian diet look like? I suppose a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetarian would need to completely drench his vegetables in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; butter and oils to make his diet high-fat. Of course there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is also cheese and eggs, which might be consumed depending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the denomination of the vegetarian church to which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one belongs.
</em><br>
<p>Regular tofu has a hefty amount of fat in it from soy oils, as do other
<br>
soy-based foods.  Mediterranean foods are high in olive oil, such as in
<br>
hummus.  Indian foods has a lot of sesame oil or tahini.  Stir-fried
<br>
vegetables are covered in oil.  Many salad dressings are oil-based or have a
<br>
lot of oils.  So do nuts, seeds and some grains.  It is easy to get a
<br>
high-fat diet as a vegetarian.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am most concerned with the unhealthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substances found in grains and legumes in the typical vegetarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet, e.g., lectins.
</em><br>
<p>What would be the side-effects of lectins?  What are the symptoms?  My
<br>
nutrition research in earlier years included a lot of symptoms for too much
<br>
or too little of each nutrient, so I could help gauge my personal needs.  If
<br>
there were symptoms of lectin intake that I could detect in myself, I might
<br>
be tempted to cut back.  Also, doesn't cooking destroy lectins?  If I don't
<br>
eat raw beans, am I already on a lectin-free diet?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Dairy products contain small amounts of lectins also but I think they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively harmless in comparison to grains and legumes (do you consume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dairy? I don't remember).
</em><br>
<p>I don't eat eggs or cheese unless there is nothing else available when I am
<br>
eating out, then I allow them rather than go hungry.
