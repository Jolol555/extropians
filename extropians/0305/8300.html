<p><em>&gt; Instead of specific subjects like [WAR] or [IRAQ] what if we made 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything one of the following categories:
</em><br>
<p>So what category is *your* post (i.e., *this* thread) in?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [FYI]: _fyi_topic_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Items of possible interest to extropians. Should contain an abstract or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a very few quotes along with a URL. You must be totally objective in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic title and text. Must not be replied to directly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [COMMENT]: _comment topic_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A supported comment you have no obligation in discussing further. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _comment topic_ must be a previously posted _fyi_topic_. By 'supported 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comment' I mean you *must* include a URL which either agrees (at least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in part) with your position OR provides some background information 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which you reference. Must not be replied to directly.
</em><br>
<p>WHAT??  The first *two* categories you compose are &quot;not to be
<br>
replied to&quot;!  What kind of an email forum is that?  How did
<br>
such a funky, limiting rule come into your head?
<br>
<p>I'm sorry ;-) but I'm already criticizing your idea.  But I
<br>
definitely believe that nothing should be above criticism,
<br>
and (as a loyal adherent of PCR) firmly contend that criticism
<br>
is the life blood of progress.
<br>
<p>The very idea of applauding someone posting a &quot;hit-and-run&quot; message,
<br>
doubtless filled with the most incendiary material, is laughable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [DISCUSS]: _discussion_topic_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A topic you wish to discuss. The _discussion_topic_ must be a previously 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posted _comment topic_. It is obligatory for the topic starter to paste 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the entire FYI or COMMENT message into the first post. Supporting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your position with URLs is encouraged but not required. Let the flames 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begin. You cannot start a DISCUSSion on your own COMMENT.
</em><br>
<p>I love your choice of vocabulary:  &quot;must&quot;, &quot;obligatory&quot;, &quot;required&quot;,
<br>
&quot;cannot&quot;.  What part of Europe did you say you were from?  Well,
<br>
lemme tell you something, buster, [cowboy rant about freedom and
<br>
individuality suppressed for the sake of decorum].
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [META]: _meta_topic_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead of comments and discussions on meta topics, we leave this as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normal (as in, you are free to reply directly to meta topics)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And that's it. Seems to me it has the virtue of simplicity. All 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussions start with an FYI, then require someone to COMMENT on it, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then someone else to start a DISCUSSion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you think?
</em><br>
<p>Oh.  Okay.  So it was okay to respond to this.  How unfortunate.
<br>
It would have been so much more enjoyable if it had been forbidden.
<br>
<p>I wish I knew why you were so uninterested in receiving criticism.
<br>
That's one of the main reasons I ever post anything.  How can one
<br>
tell if one's ideas are going off the rails, or if one is blind
<br>
to some hypnotic writer or other, if one does not encourage
<br>
criticism of one's (and seemingly seductive) ideas?
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S.  You are hereby given permission to respond to this.
