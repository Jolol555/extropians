<p><em>&gt; Two things are refreshing about Fox News (and at least one or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two newscasters on MSNBC):  they're not only providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balance to ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN, but they're quite open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it.  What I hate is people pretending they're objective, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're not. 
</em><br>
<p>We disagree here (I think we covered this once before). Yes FOX is blatantly
<br>
right-wing, but it advertises itself as unbiased. The FOX slogan, repeated
<br>
many times each day, is something like &quot;News Without the Spin,&quot; but in fact
<br>
they offer more spin than any network I've ever seen in all my life.
<br>
O'Reilly bills himself as &quot;independent&quot; but I don't think he's ever once
<br>
entertained an opinion that serious liberals would find acceptable. He was
<br>
registered GOP until recently when a reporter on another network called him
<br>
on his dishonesty in billing himself as independent. Cavuto and Hannity are
<br>
like rabid junior Newt Gingrichs. The entire network is a joke, unless one
<br>
goes in with one's eyes wide open and with full knowledge that one is about
<br>
to get a thorough soaking in GOP politics. 
<br>
<p>There is nothing wrong with advocacy journalism but FOX should be honest
<br>
about it. In fact if I were a senior executive at FOX, I would give serious
<br>
consideration to the idea of advertising the network for exactly what it is:
<br>
a conservative republican oriented news network. The strategy would probably
<br>
increase market share as conservative news consumers are starved for
<br>
something exactly like FOX. The conservative slant is the reason FOX has
<br>
been so successful: FOX fills a unique and important market niche. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Cable news networks are not obliged by law to serve the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; interest, which is one reason we see extreme advocacy journalism on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cable like that which comes from FOX.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, we know how to fix that, don't we?  How about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Fairness Doctrine&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Nah. I want less regulation, not more.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I have a theory about why the non-cable news media tends to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; biased to the left: the majority of American news consumers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; biased to the left... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, there are two basic factors:  (1) journalism schools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indoctrinate their students like nobody's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business---conservative students are made to feel quite out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it and uncomfortable, and perhaps don't even make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through unless they're careful  (2) the kind of people who go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into journalism often do so to &quot;change the world&quot; with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of typical idealism so manifest among the young.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conservatives tend to follow other paths.
</em><br>
<p><p>You're ignoring the fierce competition between ABC, NBC and CBS for Neilson
<br>
ratings and advertising dollars. I've worked in consumer market research and
<br>
I can tell you that if the American people did not like liberal TV
<br>
journalists then their contracts would not be renewed; they would be fired
<br>
and replaced by conservatives at the first opportunity. However the majority
<br>
of American people (not the majority of voters) have a liberal mindset, so
<br>
the non-cable news media also has a liberal mindset. The journalism
<br>
professors are just products of the market like everyone else.
<br>
<p>A huge fraction of Americans, something like 50%, are politically apathetic
<br>
non-voters. They tend to be liberal-minded people of low socioeconomic
<br>
status. However those liberal-minded non-voters watch the evening news, and
<br>
so along with politically active liberals they represent the majority of
<br>
news consumers and so control the non-cable market for news. It's just free
<br>
enterprise at work (ironically).
