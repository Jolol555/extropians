<em>&gt; Atkins Diet Shows Surprising Results, Researcher Says; One-year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Study Shows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Diet May Be As Effective And Safe As Conventional Diets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/05/030522083022.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/05/030522083022.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>Here is an abstract of the study itself:
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/348/21/2082">http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/348/21/2082</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>This study looked very interesting.  It confirmed one of my complaints,
<br>
which was that no previous scientifically-controlled studies have been
<br>
performed on the Atkins diet.  This is the very first one.  I was very eager
<br>
to see the results of this, since it claims to be the first and only
<br>
controlled study to be performed on the Atkins diet.
<br>
<p>I purchased this article for review.  It was not as interesting as the
<br>
abstract or media hype made it appear.
<br>
<p>In summary:
<br>
<p>It is not a very good study because they didn't make sure people followed
<br>
the diets.  The study admits a lot of adherence and attrition problems.
<br>
There were some results at first at the three-month point, but these
<br>
disappeared by the end of the year-long study.  This was when compliance was
<br>
at its worst.  The main claim of the study is that Atkins was no different
<br>
than conventional diets at the end, but it's not clear that anybody was
<br>
following Atkins by then.  I think the earlier results are more conclusive,
<br>
and they did not fare well for the Atkins diet.
<br>
<p>Details:
<br>
<p>They did not control the foods eaten by people.  People were supposed to
<br>
follow the diets assigned to them, but there were a lot of adherence and
<br>
attrition problems.  It is not clear how much the people followed the diets.
<br>
Many of the measurements, including keytones, cholesterol, weight loss,
<br>
etc., had changes at the three month point, but went away at six months and
<br>
twelve months.  It seems that the participants were not following the diets
<br>
as well later in the year.  This means that the final results may not be as
<br>
accurate as the first few months.  The study itself concluded that more
<br>
studies need to be done to determine the safety or efficacy of the Atkins
<br>
diet.  It does not support or vindicate the Atkins diet, despite the media
<br>
hype.
<br>
<p>They seemed to refute the basic keytone theory of the Atkins diet.  They
<br>
noted that there was no correlation between the excretion of keytones and
<br>
weight loss.  Again, the weight loss seemed directly proportional to the
<br>
number of calories consumed.  Keytosis did not seem to speed up or assist
<br>
the process.  They also noted that ketosis was not present after six months.
<br>
Either the keytosis stopped working, or the participants were no longer
<br>
following the diet at that point.
<br>
<p>They seem to refute that macronutrient ratios had any effect.  The weight
<br>
loss in the beginning of the Atkins diet was due to the consumption of less
<br>
total calories.  They concluded that &quot;When the energy content of an
<br>
energy-deficit diet is stable, macronutrient composition does not influence
<br>
weight loss.&quot;  It appears that equal calories produce equal weight loss no
<br>
matter what the macronutrient combination is.  This seems to refute the idea
<br>
that different calories contribute to weight gain differently.  It supports
<br>
the idea that reducing total calories is equally effective for weight loss
<br>
on high-carb, low-carb, high-fat, low-fat, high-protein, or low-protein
<br>
diets.
<br>
<p>There seemed to be little difference between diet results.  It appears that
<br>
most of the blood measurements showed no difference between the two diet
<br>
groups.  There was no difference in weight loss, blood pressure, insulin
<br>
sensitivity or total cholesterol between the groups.  There were some
<br>
difference in the beginning, which I think are more significant due to the
<br>
latter attrition rates, but these do not look good for the Atkins diet.
<br>
<p>For total cholesterol, the conventional diet dropped it, while the Atkins
<br>
diet increased it.  The difference between the groups lessened toward the
<br>
end of the year.
<br>
<p>For LDL (bad) cholesterol, the conventional diet dropped it while the Atkins
<br>
diet increased it.  The difference between the groups lessened toward the
<br>
end of the year.
<br>
<p>For HDL (good cholesterol), both diets increased it, while the Atkins
<br>
increased it at a higher rate.
<br>
<p>For triglycerides, both diets decreased it.  For some reason, the
<br>
conventional diet reversed direction and went back up toward the end of the
<br>
year.
<br>
<p>They even mentioned that &quot;These data do not demonstrate an effect of
<br>
macronutrient composition, independent of weight loss, on insulin
<br>
sensitivity in obese subjects without diabetes.&quot;  This even implies that
<br>
high-carb diets are not worse for insulin sensitivity and causing diabetes
<br>
than the equivalent number of protein or fat calories!  (This had a
<br>
disclaimer about the study's unreliability, small size, etc.)
<br>
<p>In summary:
<br>
It looks to me that calorie restriction is the clear winner for either kind
<br>
of diet.  The high-carb diet seemed to be better at improving cholesterol
<br>
factors, while the high-protein and high-fat diet seemed to worsen these
<br>
factors.  (The only good news for Atkins was on the triglycerides, maybe at
<br>
the end of the year where the diets were less reliable.)  This seems
<br>
consistent with my understanding of nutrition.  It also gives even more
<br>
weight to calorie restriction being more important and the specific
<br>
macronutrient ratios being less important.
<br>
<p>Disclaimer:
<br>
Since the study participants were so poor at following the diets, it is not
<br>
clear that any conclusions can be drawn from this study, especially a year
<br>
later.  Even the study itself has disclaimers and says more studies are
<br>
needed.  This study is definitely not definitive for anything, is the first
<br>
study, is unproven and not reproduced, and at best says Atkins isn't any
<br>
worse than other diets.  This is not very good support for the diet at all,
<br>
despite the media hype for it.
