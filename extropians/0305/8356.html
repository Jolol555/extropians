<p>
I applaud Lee Crocker for coming up with an original proposal for
<br>
electronic voting.  However I will offer some criticisms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At the polling place, each voter goes through the touch-screen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand-holding menu options of the voting software. When he's done,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a simple paper receipt is printed that shows an overview of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; votes, which he is asked to read and confirm by placing it through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a reader and pressing a comfirmation button. On that receipt is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also printed a large random number unique to each voter. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reader processes the vote and sends it to a central server. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the user made a mistake, he just discards the reciept without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; submitting it and starts over. The voter retains this receipt.
</em><br>
<p>I see two problems here.  The lesser one is that no paper is left at
<br>
the polling place.  I understand that you have other mechanisms to
<br>
address this.  Nevertheless the traditional systems have the advantage
<br>
that a stack of paper ballots is there to be counted, and re-counted
<br>
if necessary.  Your system relies on a more distributed and abstract
<br>
mechanism for auditing.
<br>
<p>The greater problem is that this system facilitates selling votes.
<br>
After the election, an official receipt showing a certain vote will
<br>
probably be able to be turned in for cash in many jurisdictions.
<br>
<p>We could address the first problem by building a Xerox machine into the
<br>
vote scanner so that either the voter or the precinct gets a copy of
<br>
the vote and the other gets the original.  (Or wait - is there really
<br>
a difference between the copy and the original?  That's something we
<br>
should definitely spend many, many hours debating!)
<br>
<p>For the second problem, maybe you could somehow make the receipts be
<br>
easily forgeable, but allow forgeries to be distinguished from true
<br>
receipts only by the voting office.  There could be a secret checksum
<br>
algorithm embedded in the serial number, or some such.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; After election day, each precinct publishes two lists (on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; net, on paper, whatever): one is nothing but a list of names of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone who voted. This is already public information (when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go in to vote today, your name is checked off on the registration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list). This way, everyone who voted can verify that his name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears on the list, and that names of people who he knows didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vote (or who are dead, etc.) do not appear.
</em><br>
<p>This is a good idea in any case, and as you say it is already done
<br>
at least implicitly, and no doubt explicitly in some jurisdictions.
<br>
You can probably walk into the voting office and look in some big ledger
<br>
to find the list of all the people who voted, and then see if any of them
<br>
look bogus.  Putting that data on the net would facilitate this process.
<br>
There may be some privacy concerns, though.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The second list is the same number of entries, each of which is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plaintext list of votes cast, along with a random number index made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by hashing together the random number printed on the voter stub
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with info such as the voter's name, address, birthdate, etc., and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the votes themselves (a one-way hash). Each voter can then run a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program (with a published algorithm) to hash the random number on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his receipt with the information he knows, and then go to the list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find that index, and verify that the published votes match.
</em><br>
<p>Here it may be getting a little too complex.  Many voters won't have
<br>
the ability to run these algorithms, especially the elderly, who vote
<br>
in large numbers.  I don't see why you can't just use the same receipt
<br>
numbers that are already on the ballot, though.
<br>
<p>There may also be a privacy concern here.  Especially in smaller towns,
<br>
distinctive votes on certain issues may give people a good idea of
<br>
who certain ballots belong to.  This would then reveal the content of
<br>
their other votes.  Maybe the same thing happens in principle under the
<br>
present system; in some areas people may be able to inspect the votes,
<br>
which would reveal the same sorts of correlations.  But your proposal
<br>
requires all this to be put on the net and be widely available, making
<br>
the privacy impact worse.  (However it would be a mother lode for data
<br>
miners intent on learning how political issues related to each other.)
<br>
<p>In any case, this auditing procedure looks reliable in theory.  But I'm
<br>
not sure that we could confidently say that it is as good as the present
<br>
system.  Some elections are very close, and even a fraction of a percent
<br>
will swing the results.  If it were possible to get away with a small
<br>
amount of &quot;virtual ballot stuffing&quot; then people would lose confidence
<br>
in the system.
<br>
<p>Of course, paper ballot box stuffing happens, too.  But in that case
<br>
we use well-understood principles of physical security and auditing to
<br>
make it difficult for one or just a few people to get away with it.
<br>
All handling of the ballots is done under the watchful eyes of
<br>
representatives of the political parties, as well as disinterested
<br>
observers.  You're going to need either a good conspiracy, or some clever
<br>
security hacking, to get fake ballots into the box.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, it's not clear that we can expect this level of security
<br>
in the computer world.  While we can no doubt do better than just running
<br>
this software on Windows on an Internet-connected computer, it still may
<br>
be possible that people can get access to it somehow, and make changes
<br>
without being caught.
<br>
<p>The point is that given the lack of deterrence to such attempts,
<br>
we need a very strong degree of reliability in the auditing process.
<br>
And I don't see that your proposal provides that.  It depends on people
<br>
checking their own recorded vote, but how many people will do so?
<br>
Few enough even vote.  Probably most voters will have lost their
<br>
receipts by the time this information is published a few days later.
<br>
And if they do get motivated and check the results the first few times,
<br>
over the years, they are likely to become careless.  I'd guess that only
<br>
a small percentage would make the effort in a typical election.
<br>
<p>Having said that, your system could still have a good chance of catching
<br>
at least some kinds of fraud.  Suppose the hackers can't alter the voting
<br>
rolls.  Then they can't add more votes to the list, or the number of votes
<br>
won't equal the number of voters.  So they have to change or delete some
<br>
votes and hope that those voters don't happen to check their results.
<br>
Maybe they'll change half a percent of the votes in order to sway a
<br>
close election.  Then 99.5% of the votes are fine.  At first I thought
<br>
this meant that 99.5% of the people would have to check their votes in
<br>
order to have a good chance of catching the fraud.
<br>
<p>But that's not so.  1 voter has a 0.5% chance of being one of the victims,
<br>
so that is his chance of catching it.  2 voters increase the chance to 1%
<br>
that one of their votes has been altered.  The chances of catching the
<br>
fraud increase almost linearly with the number of voters, up through the
<br>
50% level or so.  That means that if only 200 or so voters check their
<br>
ballots, they will detect the stuffing with a high degree of likelihood.
<br>
And in a typical election, such numbers would represent a very small
<br>
percentage of the voters.
<br>
<p>So your system does work very well to catch altered or deleted votes, if
<br>
there are enough to swing any but the most hairs-breadth-close elections,
<br>
even if only a few percent of the voters audit their results.  The harder
<br>
type of fraud to catch would be added votes, which means putting fake
<br>
names onto the voter rolls.  I'm not sure how the vulnerability of your
<br>
approach to this problem would compare with how things are done today.
<br>
