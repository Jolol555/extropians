<p>Yeah.  But hey, media books can be decent.  Mark Atwood's a big fan, his line
<br>
seemed to be &quot;better SF&quot;, not better literarily.  Some searching of Usenet
<br>
archives had people arguing that the book at least takes place inside the
<br>
&quot;Culture&quot;, unlike the Culture books... this all long before Look to Windward.
<br>
The usual charge being that the Culture can't support stories about itself
<br>
because utopia is boring.
<br>
<p>But I also saw charges that Aaronvich's book is a shallow copy... I dunno.
<br>
Apparently the ship names are those of other Dr. Who authors.  Woo.  I think
<br>
MacLeod did better.
<br>
<p>I was annoyed by one comment that it better because it was 'funner' or
<br>
'funnier' (I forget which) than _Consider Phlebas_.  As if CP was trying to be
<br>
fun!
<br>
<p>So, I dunno if I'll try to find a copy, since my libraries failed me.
