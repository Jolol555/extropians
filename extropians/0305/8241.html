Hi Phil,<br><br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>This is an
open forum so I won't complain about people grinding their political axes
here. I do however object to people claiming scientific backing (albeit
vague) for what are in reality politically motivated statements. You have
a right to your beliefs but don't call them &quot;scientific facts&quot;
as that makes us real medical scientists who actually spend long hours in
the lab trying to find those elusive &quot;scientific facts&quot; kind of
upset.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>First off,
AIDS patients, gays, and/or hippies had nothing to do with the emergence
of drug resistant tuberculosis or any other antibiotic resistant
bacteria. But don't take my word for it for unlike you, I don't have to
imagine detailed references. They are all right here at my fingertips.
For example here is a recent abstract from a peer reviewed scientific
journal regarding drug resistant TB:<br><br>
<table border=0>

Mar;16(1):73-105<td width=214></td></tr>

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.<br><br>
Seaworth BJ.<br><br>
Tuberculosis Elimination Division, Tuberculosis Education Center, Texas
Center for Infectious Diseases, San Antonio, Texas, USA.<br><br>
Multidrug-resistant TB is a growing public health problem. Although
control of the multidrug-resistant TB epidemic has been achieved in New
York City, strains of multidrug-resistant TB are found in nearly every
state. Much of the world faces a growing problem with no immediate
solution. The treatment habits and policies that have led to this problem
persist. New drug development has been almost nonexistent. The current
tremendous global interest offers hope, as does the Global Alliance for
Tuberculosis Drug Development supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Their mission is to accelerate the
discovery and development of new antituberculosis drugs and put them on
the market within 10 years, at prices affordable in less-developed
countries. <b>As Dr. Reichman notes, &quot;this action will not address
the main underlying cause of almost all drug resistance, non-adherence of
patients and doctors to recommended regimens.&quot; </b>He calls for an
equal commitment to improving the capacity of health care workers to use
new and older agents correctly, so that they may continue to be effective
in the future. Each year brings new, at-risk immigrants to the United
States from all regions of the globe. They bring all the TB problems of
their countries of origin with them. Foreign-born people will have a
significant impact on TB control efforts in the next decade and beyond.
TB elimination programs will need to incorporate systems that can
adequately address TB within the United States and support national TB
programs in developing countries to help them develop the capacity to
successfully manage their own TB problems. A review of the drug
resistance patterns isolated from foreign-born people should be adequate
to convince even skeptics of the need to support global TB
programs.<br><br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>I have
bolded the part that clearly states where drug resistance comes from. It
is from patients like you who think they know better and therefore don't
take the medications the way they are supposed to be taken. They either
forget to take the medication too often or they start to feel better and
so stop taking it to early, or worse they take it without the advice of a
doctor since they have all those leftovers from their last sore throat.
Not that there aren't some doctors to blame. God knows there are way too
many physicians out there more than happy to prescribe an antibiotic for
people with a viral infection like a cold &quot;just in case&quot;
knowing full well it won't do a bit of good. Who knows... it may even
start the next plague.<br><br>

wrote:<br><br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>&quot;finally,
in the early '90's, I heard this local (Los Angeles) research <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>doctor who
headed the largest local operation directed <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>at AIDS on
one of the talk radio shows and I called in <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>and posed
the question, prefacing it by mentioning <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>that I had
read McNeil's &quot;Plagues and Peoples.&quot; <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>There was
a very noticeable pause before the doctor <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>answered,
and you could hear in his voice that he knew <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>he was
going to catch hell for saying it, but he did, <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>and he
stated that in fact specifically the rise in <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>drug
resistant TB was known for certain to be a direct <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>result of
the AIDS epidemic. When people can't ever <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>quite
shake an infection, because their immune systems <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>are shot,
and have to keep dosing it with antibiotics, <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>over and
over, then we all know exactly what the <br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>inevitable
result is going to be - SUPER GERMS!<br><br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>I am
curious which doctor it was since both the chairman and vice chairman of
the largest local AIDS research operation (UCLA AIDS Institute) sit on my
PhD committee and I can't imagine either one of them saying
that.<br><br>
Nuff said? Thanks.<br><br>

P.S. A major source of worry regarding antibiotic-resistant strains of
bacteria amongst us scientists are the huge amounts of antibiotics fed to
cattle and other livestock by ranchers and farmers on a daily basis. The
livestock is perfectly healthy so they do it for the purely economic
reason that they get a few extra pounds of meat from those livestock by
doing it. So maybe even heterosexual married god-fearing conservative
farmers in the midwest may be to blame... in addition to all those
hippies, gays, and other unsavory characters from the left. ;)<br><br>
