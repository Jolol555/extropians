<p><em>&gt;One of the problems with name calling is that it can backfire.  If they

<p><em>&gt;in the vitriolic exchange between John and Samantha, one of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here is where the name-calling comes in.  Making a mistake is one thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But calling your opponent an &quot;idiot&quot; for taking a position opposite to

<p>IIRC, Mike Lorrey informed us of the certainty that those terrified
<br>
American troops displayed on Iraqi TV were dead soon after the filming.

They looked quite chipper last time I saw them on the news.
