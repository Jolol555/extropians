<p><em>&gt; What is the etymology of the term &quot;squicked&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Squick&quot; appears to have originated at MIT, where it was supposedly an 
<br>
onomatopoetic word, imitative of the frictional sound made when a human 
<br>
penis engages in frottage of an exposed human brain. I believe the word was 
<br>
used in those circles as an ejaculation, i.e. when working on hard 
<br>
problems: &quot;Grind, grind, squick, squick.&quot;
<br>
<p>It attained a great deal of currency online in the early 1990s on Usenet's 
<br>
alt.sex.bondage newsgroup, where it took on the meaning of visceral 
<br>
distaste/turnoff/&quot;your kink is not OK&quot;. Ex.: &quot;I am squicked by &lt;x&gt;&quot;, &quot;You 
<br>
squicked me&quot;, and the singleton (often mock) safeword &quot;SQUICK!&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If lightning never strikes in the same place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twice, and your lightning rod gets a hit, should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you throw it away?  Do you need to get a new one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to replace it?  How do the later lightning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bolts know which places are already taken?
</em><br>
<p>You do need to throw it away. If you replace it, it counts as a new place. 
<br>
That's too risky. The later storms use a process known as &quot;lightning 
<br>
calculation&quot; to determine where not to hit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is the origin of the term etymology?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; What was the first game ever invented?  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did people play before that?
</em><br>
<p>The first game ever invented was &quot;am I really going to kill you or not?&quot;
<br>
Before that, people just played dumb.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a watched pot never boils, and mass-energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a conserved quantity, into what form does the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy of the fire under a watched pot go?  Could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you use a pair of fake eyes to fool the pot into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking it is being watched?
</em><br>
<p>The energy goes into producing watches. Einsteinian mass-energy equivalence 
<br>
means it takes a very long time for an actual (visible to the naked eye) 
<br>
watch to manfest. Which is good, because past that point it can go into 
<br>
over-unity feedback.
<br>
<p>Fooling pot with fake eyes isn't that easy; pot does make some people 
<br>
paranoid, but it tends to be mellow itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In a society that gets all squicked and starts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passing laws forbidding teens from their tongues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surgically split, why do we routinely whack off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tip of the newborn's penis?  Presumably against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the infant's will?
</em><br>
<p>Because it's no skin off the adults' nose.
<br>
<p>Sorry I missed the party.
<br>
<p>MMB
