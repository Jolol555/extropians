<p><em>&gt; If this aesthetic appreciation for animals is as widespread as you

</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly. I can't fathom that one would be a vegetarian because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals appear pleasant to the eye. If anything, you should want to eat
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; says, eat what appears pleasing to the senses, as this is the default
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet of all successful species.   
</em><br>
<p>By aesthetic, I mean any appreciation of value. Superficial appearance,
<br>
especially to the point of looking &quot;tasty&quot;, is only one criterion. I was
<br>
thinking more along the lines of appreciating an animal's differences, its
<br>
lifestyle, its unique personality, its communality. I haven't compiled a
<br>
detailed analysis of what value is to be found in animals, what enjoyment
<br>
is possible in their living forms  - it's not something I've struggled
<br>
with. I find views like yours mysterious. I don't think animals look
<br>
particularly tasty. There's an entire cable channel devoted to animals,
<br>
with specials directed at young people, who supposedly like animals even
<br>
more than adults. The focus in on animals' lifestyles, not their tastiness
<br>
after death.
<br>
Ancedotally, I've noticed people who raise animals for food tend to
<br>
appreciate even the livestock as individuals; they just cultivate a sort
<br>
of hardness/mental block to enable them to slaughter the animal as
<br>
necessary. They also appreciate their other animals, like horses, or wild
<br>
birds, that they can interact with without eating.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No doubt there is an evolved instinct to react negatively to the death
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an animate creature. Of course there is, because all the animals who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuck around to watch other animals being eaten by predators became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seconds. But your reasoning from default insincts to a not-so-obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aesthetic conclusion which somehow implies a particular diet is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; muddle.   
</em><br>
<p>It may be a muddle to you, but it's not a muddle to me :) I'm not talking
<br>
about human instincts, about which we know very little. I also tend to be
<br>
suspicious of the &quot;just so&quot; stories of evolutionary
<br>
psychology/sociobiology. I'm talking about enjoyment you could
<br>
(possibly) access in the present, yourself. Watch a few nature
<br>
documentaries, interact with a friend's pet a bit. See if you don't get
<br>
some pleasure from animals other than chowing down on their burnt muscles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; themselves. Our far-from-ordinary brains do many intractable things, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we sometimes invent words to facilitate discussion of them, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'happiness', 'reason', or 'thought'. To say an animal is 'happy' or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'sad' might help children and bad poets understand animal behavior a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little better. But it certainly doesn't help me, and it certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't imply anything profound to me. 
</em><br>
<p>Inferring animal emotion and rationality (ability to calculate with
<br>
various algorithms) helps animal trainers, farmers, even hunters -
<br>
everyone who really has to understand an animal in immediately practical
<br>
terms. It may not be necessary for someone who has no interaction with
<br>
live animals, or who has a vested interest in promoting human value
<br>
superiority across every domain.
<br>
<p>Humans aren't the only animals that are unique or that have special tricks
<br>
of the trade of life. Bird brains can do things mine can't, and that I
<br>
might wish it could. (We are just now developing the technology to allow
<br>
us to imitate some of its features and adapt it for our use).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I gather that you feel pain and care about what happens to yourself. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this does not imply anything about animals, or even me for that matter.
</em><br>
<p>You really can't infer much more about me than you can about animals. You
<br>
may be being sidetracked by nominalism. Happiness is more than a word.
