Hey Everyone,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out this link about some cool new technology that turns garbage into
<br>
petroleum:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.discover.com/may_03/featoil.html">http://www.discover.com/may_03/featoil.html</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, this seems to be the best solution to the energy crisis
<br>
currently available. If we could scale this technology up to current oil
<br>
industry size, we could kill three birds with one stone. We would eliminate
<br>
the need for unhealthy and enviromentally unsound land fills, end our
<br>
dependance on foreign oil, and cut off the funding for terrorists at the
<br>
knees. Without oil revenue, the arab countries will be less able to afford
<br>
things like terrorist training camps and weapons of mass destruction. This
<br>
seems far preferable to the prospect of waging war on the arab countries one
<br>
by one to install pro-US governments who will let our oil companies have
<br>
their way with them under the guise of a nebulous &quot;war on terror&quot;. Of course
<br>
this is assuming that our own &quot;leaders&quot; don't own tons of stocks in General
<br>
Dynamics and other arms manufacturers (which they do) otherwise they would
<br>
be inclined to wage war anyways simply for the sake of waging war, since
<br>
they would make money off of every bomb that falls. This economic incentive
<br>
seems to factor into our otherwise irrational current foreign policy of
<br>
&quot;pre-emption&quot; i.e. invading weak countries and &quot;unilateralism&quot; i.e. pissing
<br>
off the rest. Just goes to show you that no matter how small the world gets,
<br>
there are always those who are willing to shrink to keep pace with it.
<br>
