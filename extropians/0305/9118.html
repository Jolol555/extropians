I'm trying to recall when Koestler started writing
<br>
about the differentiation of cells from egg to adult
<br>
and the subsequent de-differentiation of aging.  His
<br>
analogy was of a typewriter keyboard in which a lot of
<br>
the keys were taped over, but with time the tape fell
<br>
off.
<br>
<p>That IS the interesting question:

<br>
<p>(Aside: It seems to me that the popular fixation on
<br>
DNA seems to be wrong to me. Its DNA *interacting*
<br>
with proteins which do almost everything that matters
<br>
in biology. DNA of itself is almost completely
<br>
uninteresting. The same DNA is in every cell 
<br>
type. Yet what makes different cell types and this
<br>
applies all the way back to the fertilized egg which
<br>
contains a cocktail of proteins is the way the
<br>
proteins interact with the DNA and selectively turn 
<br>
certain genes off and on in turn creating other
<br>
proteins in the mix both in type and in number. If we
<br>
knew all the proteins in the maternal oocyte, both
<br>
number and type, that would be powerful knowledge
<br>
indeed, because these early proteins are crucial to 
<br>
early development and they do not come from the DNA of
<br>
the fertilized egg or new individual but from the
<br>
mother. At this point we don't know what these are). 
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So, there is a kind of meta-DNA cellular memory?  With
<br>
error checking, one might presume?  And the ability to
<br>
respond to changes?  Can we come up with an overall
<br>
description or characterization of this meta-system?
<br>
<p>I continue to be intrigued with the fact that about
<br>
99% of the human DNA is considered &quot;junk.&quot;  So, if it
<br>
is &quot;junk&quot;, then it could presumeably be deleted? 
<br>
Right?  How hard would it be to test this with some
<br>
organism with a lot of &quot;junk&quot; DNA but a small enough
<br>
total to make it practical to actually clean out a
<br>
large proportion of the &quot;junk&quot; and then see if the
<br>
system still works.
<br>
<p>Might there not be significant advantages in deleting
<br>
that 99%, assuming that only the 1% is in fact useful?
<br>
&nbsp;A lot of the 99% is probably old viral garbage, I
<br>
hazard.  Perhaps some of it is actually used by the
<br>
cell for blocking viral reproduction in some way, so
<br>
that we wouldn't discover the use until it mattered? 
<br>
Perhaps, on the other hand, viruses have learned to
<br>
use some of the &quot;junk,&quot; like common subroutines or old
<br>
.dll's that the OS never uses until you happen to
<br>
bring in some old program.  Removing it might disable
<br>
those viruses.
