<p>In a message dated 5/31/2003 2:18:04 PM Central Standard Time,
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="mailto:fauxever@sprynet.com?Subject=Re:%20Boy%20Genius%20or%20Craft%20Idiot?">fauxever@sprynet.com</a> writes: Put another way, is being deceitful ever
<br>
smart?  IMO yes.  If a  religious nut with a gun to my temple asked me
<br>
whether I believed in god, I  would lie and say &quot;yes.&quot;  Question:  Who's
<br>
keeping score here?  Answer:  The religious nut with the gun to my temple
<br>
(at least, temporarily).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Has a religious nut ever put a &gt; gun to your head?  How about the head of
</em><br>
someone you know?
<br>
<p>Ron - are we missing some connection here - hello? hello?  - what did I
<br>
write? &quot;If&quot; ... (which only means ... &quot;if&quot;).
<br>
<p>I was invoking one imaginary incident - of many other examples I could have
<br>
used - where I would bend rules and lie my face off.  It was meant as an
<br>
example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Hitler wasn't a religious nut, nor was Stalin, nor Mao?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and your point is ...?  But since you asked, Hitler, Stalin and Mao
<br>
were paranoid narcissistic nut jobs (and, interestingly, Hitler was never
<br>
excommunicated from the Church - although I am not alleging that he was a
<br>
particularly *religious* nut).  I can't help thinking some of the
<br>
anti-Jewish propaganda he learned as a Christian schoolboy didn't somehow
<br>
seep into his pores and inspire him to dislike and later kill Jews.
<br>
Discrimination against Jews was quite de rigueur in Czarist Russia, and even
<br>
in our good ole' United States of America, you know - why, it was Christian!
<br>
Another interesting fact was that Hitler's boys wore belt buckles with the
<br>
words &quot;Gott ist mit uns&quot; on them:
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case given that the universe is somewhere 10 and 20 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years old (I have seen no agreement on the age); that we can't even agree
</em><br>
whether &gt; or not this universe is the only one nor even how big it might
<br>
be -- after
<br>
<em>&gt; all when we look closely at the stars that are the furthest removed of any
</em><br>
we
<br>
<em>&gt; know then beyond them we see more stars.  Under all those circumstances
</em><br>
isn't it &gt; a little dogmatic to make vast sweeping statements about God.
<br>
<p>Yes, and I'll go even further and make dogmatic, vast sweeping statements
<br>
about mermaids, as well ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my opinion we have to all be somewhat agnostic whether we mainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe in God or believe there is no God.  We have to reserve a
</em><br>
possibility
<br>
<em>&gt; that we are mistaken.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps we are mistaken about mermaids, as well.  But why be agnostic about
<br>
mermaids?  As for me, until there is *any* reason to think otherwise, I'll
<br>
remain an atheist (as well as an amermaidist and aleprechaunist and an
<br>
amonkeykingist).  Yet, just as soon as there's incontrovertible proof that
<br>
Gummer exists, I'll believe in it/her/it.  Who's Gummer?  What, you don't
<br>
believe in Gummer?  Why not?
