I enjoyed watching it - I didn't expect anything profound, but still
<br>
found many enjoyable things. Mostly they were about visual design; note
<br>
the many isolated headshots with an off-center speaker? Somehow they
<br>
were all leading up to the discussion in the White Room, where the
<br>
off-center speaker image was united using the fractal panopticon
<br>
screens.
<br>
<p>Another interesting thing was how the first movie dealt with the issue
<br>
of real vs. virtual and hyperreality, and this was about control and
<br>
determinism - very postmodernist. Practically all the main characters
<br>
demonstrated their unwillingness to be controlled in different ways; the
<br>
only beings that were controlled were machines. Maybe the third movie
<br>
will be centered on some other pet postmodernist area, like the body? 
<br>
<p>My friend Alexander remarked that it was all a big fight between Jung
<br>
and Freud. On one side the divine planner Freud with his vision of a
<br>
perfect and civilized Matrix that unfortunately has to contain a
<br>
&quot;subconscious&quot; Zion.  On the other Neo struggling together with his
<br>
anima Trinity against his shadow Smith and all the heavy symbolism of
<br>
death-rebirth, underground centers and wise teachers. 
<br>
<p>The nice thing about the Matrix matrix of movies, games, essays, anime,
<br>
cartoons and stories is that is open and extensible. One can always dig
<br>
and explore, there is always things that can be re-interpreted. Compare
<br>
this with (say) the Terminator movies, where the amount of extra juice
<br>
that can be sucked out from the movie and spin-offs is rather limited
<br>
and strongly constrained. The Matrix may not be high literature, but it
<br>
is far better than most sf movies through its attention to detail and
<br>
complexity.
