<em>&gt; &gt; Oh, I didn't specify that the records show

<em>&gt; &gt; it in his own handwriting, but I did say that both Lucille Ball and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Desi Arnaz registered to vote as communists. A quick google for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;hollywood communist venona&quot; would bring up archived records of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; HUAC, which includes redacted FOIA documents. These HUAC documents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are all well organized by individual witness (I am sure some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; serious and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; obsessive Birchers sweated over getting this done right). Of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hollywood records, the very first ones are for Lucille Ball and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; linked statements describe the involvement of both her and her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; husband.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you must be aware that the FBI cleared them of all allegations.
</em><br>
<p>No, I wasn't, and that isn't what the FBI documents that the HUAC
<br>
archives have online show. All the FBI determined was that they were
<br>
not spying for the USSR. That wasn't really the purpose of Ball to the
<br>
CCCCP. She was a financial supporter and provided her home to meetings
<br>
and her name to the party to recruit with, just as the GOP uses Ted
<br>
Nugent and the DNC uses Barbara Streisand today.
<br>
<p>We know for a fact from the Venona Files that the California Communist
<br>
Party was involved in espionage on military facilities and industries
<br>
in that state. Ball may not have known of this, but conspiracy law
<br>
doesn't demand that the right hand know what the left hand is doing. As
<br>
a member of the State Central Committee, she was far more than just a
<br>
registered voter, and therefore much more than just a fellow traveller
<br>
or &quot;useful idiot&quot;.
<br>
<p>In fact, there is evidence that Dezi Arnez met with Castro when Fidel
<br>
was here in the US as a ball player and put him in touch with other
<br>
Cuban American communist sympathizers.
