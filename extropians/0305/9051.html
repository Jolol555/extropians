Interesting...I took it as meaning several things; (1) As we learn what 
<br>
they are, we can deliberately alter gene transcription factors for 
<br>
specific enhancement of certain processes, or inhibition of certain 
<br>
processes, (2)
<br>
We have already been altering gene transcription factors accidentally by 
<br>
our lifestyles and possibly thus making it harder for ourselves to learn 
<br>
things, (3) We _could_ have been accidentally altering such factors in a 
<br>
big way, and will soon find out what the repercussions have been, and 
<br>
(4) Everything from our behavior to our thoughts to our lifespan can be 
<br>
radically altered by these factors.
<br>
I would think therefore that Ridley's ideas are worth at least 
<br>
consideration?
<br>
I haven't actually _read_ the book to which this refers yet, but to 
<br>
quote an old saying, 'Never read a book before reviewing it; it 
<br>
prejudices the mind so'  :  )
