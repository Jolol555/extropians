<em>&gt; &gt; - Sources of food are unimportant if they contain the same nutrients and

<em>&gt; This strikes me as controversial.  I seem to recall quite a number of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, or how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nutrient was embedded in the food.
</em><br>
<p>I agree totally.  (My nutrition book listed &quot;helpers&quot; and &quot;inhibitors&quot; that
<br>
affected absorption of each nutrient.)  What I meant to counter was claims
<br>
that specific chemical molecules were different than other molecules of the
<br>
same kind from a &quot;natural&quot; source.  For example, some people think ascorbic
<br>
acid from cherries is better than ascorbic acid from a laboratory, even if
<br>
both are pure ascorbic acid.  I was trying to refute this &quot;religious
<br>
naturalism.&quot;  I agree that natural vitamin C mixed with bioflavinoids and pH
<br>
buffered in food is much better than pure acidic ascorbic acid.  I also
<br>
consider these to be difference substances that can be distinguished
<br>
scientifically and described with different chemical recipes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; - Monounsaturated fats are best, polyunsaturated fats are good,
</em><br>
saturated
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fats are bad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This also strikes me as controversial.  I seem to recall things being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot more complex than best-good-bad.  And what happened to Omega-6 and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega-3?
</em><br>
<p>Controversial as in wrong, or just simplistic?  Omega-6 and Omega-3 are
<br>
found in the polyunsaturated fats which I called &quot;good&quot;.  They are not
<br>
&quot;best&quot; because I see no need to maximize these as much as possible after
<br>
nutritional needs are met.  Most nutritionists agree that monounsaturated
<br>
fats should provide the bulk of unsaturated fats.  Likewise, they are not
<br>
&quot;bad&quot; because they should not be minimized either.  They are certainly
<br>
required in the diet.
<br>
<p>What specifically would you change about the order of monounsaturated,
<br>
polyunsaturated, and saturated?  Or what do you think should be changed in
<br>
my categorization of omega's as &quot;good&quot;.  Should they be &quot;best&quot;, meaning
<br>
substitute olive oil for pure omegas as much as possible?  Or do you have
<br>
something else in mind?
<br>
<p>For simplicity, I try to group foods together.  Omega-3 and Omega-6 are
<br>
found in the same oils.  While nutritional scientists need to distinguish
<br>
them to study them, most people can just lump the these together into the
<br>
&quot;polyunsaturated group&quot;.  Therefore, I thought referencing the group in our
<br>
&quot;consensus diet&quot; would make more sense then getting into individual
<br>
nutrients here.  If you eat this group, you get both omega-3's and
<br>
omega-6's.  If you don't eat this group, you won't get either.  This is my
<br>
motivation for lumping these together as a group and calling it &quot;good&quot;.
