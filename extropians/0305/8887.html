X-Mailer: YaBB
<br>
<p><p>Meetup.com makes more realistic the possibility that any given town will have
<br>
half a dozen or so extropians/cryonicists/virians/AI-ers/etc. who all know
<br>
about each other.
<br>
<p>The next question is what to do? There are too few people to organize a
<br>
convention without heroic effort... so, what can be done to spread the memes
<br>
on a local basis? What kind of community-level agenda should small extropian
<br>
cells have?
<br>
<p>Some ideas...
<br>
<p>* A local group knows who the local politicians are, and when national
<br>
politicians will be coming to town to speak. The group would be in the
<br>
audience to ask questions about stem cells, drug legalization, funding for
<br>
basic research, etc.
<br>
<p>* A local group probably reads the local papers. All members would write
<br>
letters to the editor whenever a relevant issues comes up with reference to
<br>
that paper. More members means more eyes to track the papers.
<br>
<p>* Organizing purely social and fun fundraisers for Extropian charities...
<br>
think raves, think paintball tournaments. Anybody know, are ExI, WTA,
<br>
Foresight tax-deductible charities? Any others anybody would suggest?
<br>
<p>* Do joint ventures with allied groups like Free-Staters, Libertarians,
<br>
atheists, pro-science groups, education groups. But making sure the Extropian
<br>
name, logos, slogans, ideas are given due credit. Maybe having tables at local
<br>
events.
<br>
<p>* A nationwide group can double its membership only after a long,
<br>
costly publicity campaign... along with some luck. A small, local group
<br>
can double it's membership simply by getting everyone to bring their
<br>
roommate/friend/significant other to the next meeting.
<br>
<p>* Extropian movie night at a local library or community center?
<br>
<p>* Counter-demonstrations against the local bible-thumpers and/or luddites?
<br>
<p><p><p>Somehow all these ideas seem kind of lacking something. I'm hoping y'all can
<br>
give me some better ones.
<br>
