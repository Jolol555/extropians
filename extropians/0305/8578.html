<br>
<p>Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen a recommendation from Strauss' disciples that one start to 
<br>
understand Strauss by studying his Natural Rights and History.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am seeing him as a man that thought that society was run by a 
<br>
natural aristocracy but that anyone could be a member of that aristocracy if they 
<br>
studied the classic both classical, medieval and modern.  He includes Marx in 
<br>
that group.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I am also seeing him as a man that does not require complete 
<br>
agreement from his disciples or others.  He has read the classics and has his 
<br>
view, others read and have their viewpoint.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However he has also studied and wrote on Machivelli -- I would think 
<br>
that would make him very vulerable to misquotation by his detractors.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received a recommendation on a writer, with a book title, 
<br>
that supposedly just destroyed Strauss.  When I have read Strauss and the 
<br>
other author I will try to come to a better judgment as to Strauss' worth.
<br>
