Thought you were going to say something else...
<br>
<p>In the late-'80's, one late weekend night while doing
<br>
my cabbie thing, I checked out the local jail, only to
<br>
be amazed by seeing a local extropian/libertarian
<br>
friend emerging with his wife.  We said hello, but I
<br>
didn't ask for an explanation, as I was a little
<br>
embarassed to see them there.
<br>
<p>Years later, I was amazed to find, one day, that my
<br>
friend had died the week before, of colon cancer.  He
<br>
had always struck me as the very picture of health,
<br>
strength and vigor.  I mentioned the jail incident to
<br>
someone then, and was informed that because his doctor
<br>
would not prescribe adequate pain medication, he had
<br>
been buying heroin on the street.
<br>
<p>Heroin is, in fact, the drug of choice for that kind
<br>
of extreme pain, with the fewest side effects and
<br>
lowest actual rate of addiction.  A LOT of doctors
<br>
went to prison in protest, refusing to stop
<br>
prescribing or supplying it to the patients who really
<br>
needed it in order to keep functioning or simply not
<br>
die in agony.
<br>
<p>Recently - the 17th of May - at the local Borders
<br>
Books in S. Coast Plaza, Orange County, Allen Bock,
<br>
Senior Editor of the Orange County Register, gave a
<br>
talk on his book, &quot;Waiting to Inhale,&quot; sponsored by
<br>
the local &quot;Friends of the Library,&quot; as a kickoff of a
<br>
new author presentation series.  Bock, who is also
<br>
author of a number of other topical books from a
<br>
libertarian slant gave an excellent presentation,
<br>
unfortunately to a small (~30 people) group, mostly
<br>
from the &quot;Friends...&quot;
<br>
<p>What has struck me in recent years is how completely
<br>
the public seems to have bought into the War On Drugs
<br>
(WOD) mythology.  My feeling is that the typical
<br>
American feels like he/she (women were the main
<br>
supporters of the prohibition disaster) is on a roll. 
<br>
The bastards hit us 9/11, and, BY GOD!, we're going to
<br>
hit them back until we feel safe and satisfied.  So,
<br>
forget the Bill of Rights, basic morality, etc.  We
<br>
are the champions of the world.  We'll do whatever we
<br>
damned well feel like, here or elsewhere.
<br>
<p>There are some signs of hope.  As Bock mentioned, a
<br>
number of states have followed California's lead and
<br>
decriminalized Mariuanna, either medicinally or
<br>
entirely.  Canada appears to be about to make that
<br>
move.  Whether this reflects any backlash against the
<br>
know-nothing jingoist patriots or is an isolated
<br>
outbreak of common sense is open to question.
