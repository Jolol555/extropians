<em>&gt; It's one month since they pulled down that statue in Baghdad. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was *four years* between the end of Gulf War I and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovery of the hidden bioweapons program, and that only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened because its administrator, Hussein Kamel, defected 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Jordan - not because the weapons inspectors independently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stumbled upon it. Nuclear weapons programs may be hard to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hide, but bioweapons seed stocks can be stored in small 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; containers and buried anywhere you please. It's a bit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premature to proclaim that there were no WMDs.
</em><br>
<p>There's a significant difference Mitch. After Gulf War I coalition
<br>
forces didn't have unfettered access to the whole of Iraq. At the moment
<br>
at least 4 divisions worth of ground forces are combing the country
<br>
looking for this stuff. The US claimed it knew Iraq had WMD of one type
<br>
or another, but it begins to look shady when the intelligence they
<br>
relied upon to make such a statement does not quickly lead them to WMD
<br>
caches. If the intelligence was not concrete enough to lead troops there
<br>
quickly, then I think it wasn't as concrete as the US administration
<br>
purported it to be prior to the war. 
<br>
<p>If WMD are not found very soon, I have no choice to conclude that the US
<br>
didn’t really have the concrete intelligence it claimed it did. Every
<br>
day that passes without finding WMD shows how little the US really knew
<br>
about WMD going in. I am even willing to make the even bolder claim that
<br>
any WMD found from here on out is just good olde-fashioned luck. If the
<br>
US was betting on finding WMD after the war, it was probably a decent
<br>
bet. If they had vague pieces of intelligence that suggested WMD were in
<br>
country, then it was an even better bet. But, this is not how it came
<br>
across. It was not presented as a speculative bet. It was presented as a
<br>
near certainty to energize a pre-emptive rationale. Now, the issue is no
<br>
longer whether Iraq had WMD. The issue is to what extent the US hoped it
<br>
would find WMD after a war, and to what extent this hope was all they
<br>
had.
