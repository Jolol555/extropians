Hi all,
<br>
<p>This is to let you know about a new initiative designed to further the
<br>
development of truly effective anti-aging interventions, by promoting
<br>
public interest and involvement in research on mammalian life extension
<br>
and by encouraging more such research to be done.  It's called the
<br>
Methuselah Mouse Prize, and it will be launched at the American Aging
<br>
Association conference on Sunday June 8th (11:45am at the Harbor Court
<br>
Hotel, 550 Light Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-6099), where we will
<br>
make the inaugural award to Andrzej Bartke.
<br>
<p>In brief, it is a prize for producing the world's longest-ever-lived
<br>
mouse.  The amount awarded is determined by the size of the prize fund,
<br>
to which anyone can contribute, and by the margin by which the record
<br>
is broken.  For more details see the Prize site:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/mmp/">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/mmp/</a>
<br>
<p>The two things that the prize needs in its early stages are publicity
<br>
and donors.  Even though we will not be trying to get huge sums into
<br>
the prize fund for a while, having a lot of small donations will add
<br>
considerable credibility to the enterprise.  Contributions can be made
<br>
up-front (by credit card online) unless they are big (over $25,000) in
<br>
which case we are taking legally-bound pledges.  All donors will be
<br>
listed on the Prize web site unless they prefer to remain anonymous.
<br>
<p>Please publicise this initiative in any way you can!
<br>
<p>Cheers, Aubrey de Grey
