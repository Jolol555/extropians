<p><em>&gt; &gt; [In the non-iterated Prisoners' Dilemma] *OBVIOUSLY* Doug 2003 should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Defect, since he knows that the 1983 version is going to cooperate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not if Doug-2003 is also an altruist.  There's more than one possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason to cooperate, after all.
</em><br>
<p>Well hell's bells.  If that's the case, then why ever Defect?
<br>
<p>Listen, the whole idea behind the *entries* in the table is that
<br>
they are the payoffs of the players.  That's what the numbers
<br>
*mean*, the utilities of the players.
<br>
<p>Now, although I say that it means you should definitely defect
<br>
in almost all cases, I am not the kind of extremist that Smullyan
<br>
is, who claimed that he would defect even against his mirror image.
<br>
(Was he just trying to be provocative, or did he slip a bearing?)
<br>
<p>I say that you should Defect (and that is what the entries in the
<br>
table say too) whenever you know what your opponent is going to do.
<br>
If you know he is going to Defect, then you Defect.  If you know
<br>
that he is going to Cooperate, then you Defect.  It's right there
<br>
in the table.
<br>
<p>The highly interesting case is if you don't know what he's going
<br>
to do AND his behavior is probably correlated with yours.  For example,
<br>
I would be afraid to Defect against a physical duplicate if he was
<br>
a close (or near) duplicate.  After all, whatever thoughts I think
<br>
are likely to course through his head as well.  But if it any entity
<br>
whatsoever, including 1983 versions of myself, then the table says
<br>
&quot;Defect&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From my viewpoint, the only good reason to *defect* is a Tit-for-Tat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retaliation to maintain social order.  Otherwise the calculation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very simple; maximum benefit to all sentients is optimized by taking C.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, I'm an altruist too (a lot of the time), and so the payoffs
<br>
in the NIPD don't reflect my true payoffs (in many cases), such as
<br>
if the table was set up so that if we Cooperate we get our arms
<br>
broken, if we mutually defect we get hospitalized for a year, and
<br>
if you Defect against my Cooperation you get off scot-free and I
<br>
get tortured to death.  In that case, I will Cooperate (and hope
<br>
that I'm dealing with a good fellow who'll do the same).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For that matter, Doug-1983 anticipates being Doug-2003, so it's in his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best selfish interest to cooperate even if he thinks Doug-2003 will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defect.
</em><br>
<p>I never said that Doug-1983 knows anything about who he's
<br>
playing.  So far as he knows, it's not his sister, his
<br>
friend, or even his future self.  He was explicit back in
<br>
1983:  you could Cooperate because it's superrational to
<br>
do so.
<br>
<p>In my thought experiment, it's simply clear as a bell that
<br>
Doug-2003 must Defect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mixing time travel and the Prisoner's Dilemma sure does make for some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting situations.  It can be resolved to mutual cooperation using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Golden Law, but only if Doug-1983 can accurately simulate a future 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self who knows his past self's decision.  The time-travel oneshot PD can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also be resolved much more straightforwardly by making a binding promise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to yourself, using self-modification or a pre-existing emotion of honor.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there are all sorts of interesting ways to change the numbers
<br>
in the boxes as written.
<br>
