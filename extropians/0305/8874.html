<em>&gt; (Mike Lorrey &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20agriculture%20and%20the%20global%20brain%20(was:%20The%20mistake%20of%20agriculture)">mlorrey@yahoo.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I like this analogy.  In some ways, agriculture was (at first) a net
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; negative for the /individuals/ in agricultural societies, but a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; positive for the societies as meta-individuals.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly. However, it is still very much the same. Look at most rugged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individualists. They invariably either hunt, fish, or otherwise seek to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recreate the 'noble savage' in their own lives as a means of renewing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individualist spirit. Look at any sort of socialist. They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invariably biased toward organized agriculture, toward social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialization and putting each individual into the proper brick form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for their place in the wall. Any means of celebrating or empowering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual is seen as criminal, immoral, wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but I have to reject your generalization here. I'm as die-hard
<br>
an individualist as there is, but I'm also a city boy, despite having
<br>
been born and raised in the rural South. I may totally reject the idea
<br>
that I have any obligations to a larger society, or that groups of
<br>
people have rights, but I nonetheless realize that using the power of
<br>
groups is a great way to achieve my individual goals. Hunting and
<br>
fishing isn't going to get me any closer to immortality or omniscience.
