<p>Yes they do. In multiple dimensions; I could probably rattle off seven or eight
<br>
off the top of my head. I would also remark that there are sheaves of combinatorics
<br>
that make it very hard for *any* analyst, of *any* temperament, to get the whole
<br>
picture; and that there are selection pressures in the human intellect that are
<br>
typically denied by most people who think they think well--on any side of an argument.
<br>
Justification is not explanation--but it serves politicians, take-to-the-streeters,
<br>
tv-watchers and historians equally well. And it's a gift that keeps on giving.

<p><em>&gt; Though Saddam can by no means pee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at any WASP snow white garden fence in Washington or even San Francisco, 
</em><br>
<p>An interesting claim, and rather bold, I think.
<br>
<p>Filtering out the pejoratives, this appears to be a claim based on no evidence.
<br>
How does one prove that someone can &quot;by no means&quot; do something to &quot;any&quot;
<br>
something-else, apart from physical impossibilities like creating a square triangle?
<br>
How does one falsify the claim?
<br>
<p>As far as /I/ can tell, anyone with a few tens of thousands of dollars, a little
<br>
counter-profile schooling, a bit of patient persistence and an IQ over 90 has
<br>
a fair chance at peeing on *somebody's* fence, anywhere in the world--and I don't
<br>
discount the people who don't meet all of *those* criteria. Especially if they
<br>
don't care about getting out. Tell me where I'm wrong, here.
<br>
<p>Not a wasp, have a garden (in need of work), no fence,
<br>
