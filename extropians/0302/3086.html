<em>&gt; ### I have been thinking about this issue for a long time. It sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very attractive, to have private, competing highway systems. One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing bugs me however - the acquisition of the land for roads would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be quite difficult. You couldn't use eminent domain (or could you?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snip....a lot of stuff regarding land theft (hostile buy out...what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a nice term)&gt;
</em><br>
<p>### Still better than eminent domain. BTW, a lot of libertarian theorists do
<br>
accept eminent domain, and they do not call it stealing.
<br>
<p>------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea of private highways has merit.  They even exist.  The last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time I was in Maine I was informed that Maine's toll road was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privately owned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However...lets examine an alternative.  Two alternatives. ...to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stealing land.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One...elevate the highways.  There are already EXTREMELY long bridges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thru out the world....I know of one over a swamp (excuse me....and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enviromentally sensitive wet land............a swamp)  in Louisana
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ........about 20 miles long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In such a case there would be minimal impact on the existing land use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ....similar to wind farms....each tower takes up about 50 x 50 foot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of land......such might be the case of the supporting towers for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elevated roadway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Secondly...tunnels. The Eiesenhower tunnel on I-70 west of Denver is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several miles long.  It's several decades old....I would guess the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tunneling techniques have improved. I dunno anything about tunnels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it would seem that they don't interfer with surface use of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land.
</em><br>
<p>### You still need to buy permission for the elevated roads from land
<br>
owners, and the cost would be prohibitive in both cases.
