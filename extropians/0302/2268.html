</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I think we're in basic agreement here on that paragraph.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm saying that our conventional sense of self, identifying strongly
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything else as Other, often to be defended against, has served us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well as we have evolved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm suggesting that as we move beyond our evolutionary constraints,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual self will diminish.  Many of us will choose to expand in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this manner, because it will provide a vastly richer experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm surprised you began and finished your post by referring to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics.  My understanding is that one can not derive &quot;ought&quot; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;is&quot;, and all moral and ethical choices are ultimately based on local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values.  The best one can rationally aim for is consistency.  From
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what did you infer I was making an ethical judgement?
</em><br>
<p>### Well, I felt that you used the word &quot;to suggest&quot; in the meaning &quot;it is
<br>
desirable&quot;, and saying it is desirable to change one's basic values would be
<br>
an ethical statement. I guess have overinterpreted what you said, although
<br>
on the other hand, since you say the non-self bound identity will be
<br>
&quot;richer&quot;, there is some value judgment involved.
<br>
<p>But generally, regarding the description of possible avenues of human
<br>
development, I agree with you. There will be group-minds, and identities of
<br>
many kinds in the future, including the Compositions from &quot;The Golden Age&quot;,
<br>
the Borg, spawns, and others. A Composition is a group-mind produced from
<br>
the voluntary coalescence of multiple minds, with loss of personal identity
<br>
and full dedication to the survival of the Composition as a whole (or other
<br>
group-defined goals). A Borg is the product of involuntary incorporation of
<br>
minds into a group mind. A spawn is a group mind produced by copying of one
<br>
person and voluntary linking of the copies.
<br>
<p>I would fight the Borg to the death (and blow my brains out to prevent being
<br>
taken over).
<br>
<p>Of Compositions and spawns I would greatly prefer to form my own spawn,
<br>
rather than become a part of a Composition. However, the choices humans will
<br>
have might be limited in many ways.
<br>
<p>E.g., imagine an economy based on interstellar trade in materials
<br>
indispensable for extended survival (femto-scale M-brane complexes needed
<br>
for infallible quantum computing have to be scraped off the surface of
<br>
neutron stars, and transported to central black holes to be mixed with the
<br>
dark matter from galactic halo, and spun into mind-supporting machines).
<br>
Interstellar trade empires would form, and the ones whose emissaries could
<br>
work thousands of light-years away from the other members, reliably, would
<br>
compete for customers. If a Composition member was attacked by pirates or
<br>
competitors, it would rather die than cooperate with them and divulge the
<br>
crucial network passwords. A free-range human, in a tight-spot would try to
<br>
weasel his way out, and likely sell out his company. A trading network run
<br>
by a Composition would then enjoy a substantial competitive edge over
<br>
classical human networks. Soon, unable to compete on price, and unable to
<br>
pay for my quantum computer I might find myself forced to join the
<br>
Composition, or try to spawn fast enough to become a viable business
<br>
entity - but then, will it be possible? Even a fast-spawning human might be
<br>
unable to keep up with a Composition or a Borg. Perhaps a merge would be a
<br>
possibility - a Composition formed by a number of spawns, still maintaining
<br>
a large amount of personal identity, but modified to suit the needs of the
<br>
business. As long as the spawn-member knows the other parts of the
<br>
Composition still contain his spawn-brothers, he would be as dutiful and
<br>
incorruptible as a regular Composition.
<br>
<p>But then, maybe all this is a figment of imagination (:-). Viral entities
<br>
will preclude the existence of large Compositions, and we will still remain
<br>
individual. I am certain only that the future will be full of surprises.
