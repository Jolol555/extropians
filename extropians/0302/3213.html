Apparently there is some controversy about this Hafnium nuclear-decay
<br>
phenomenon.  Lawrence Livermore National Lab tried and failed to
<br>
reproduce the effect in 1991, according to this press release,
<br>
<a href="http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/06news/NewsReleases/2001/NR-01-08-05.html">http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/06news/NewsReleases/2001/NR-01-08-05.html</a>.
<br>
I don't know the current state of the controversy.
<br>
<p>I also want to reiterate that this cannot be thought of as a source
<br>
of energy like petroleum mining, it is a form of energy storage
<br>
like Hydrogen gas.  We can't run our economy off of mined Hafnium.
<br>
We could take energy generated by other means and (in principle)
<br>
store it in Hafnium for later release, assuming the effect is real.
<br>
The bonus is that the storage density is very large: one article,
<br>
<a href="http://physicsweb.org/article/world/12/5/3">http://physicsweb.org/article/world/12/5/3</a>, claims that &quot;one gram of
<br>
material could store several giga-joules of energy&quot;.  It also mentions
<br>
space travel as a possible application for the technology.
<br>
<p>As far as the decay products, the articles I have found claim that Hf-178
<br>
is stable.  I think the only issue is that this &quot;excited&quot; Hafnium state
<br>
(generated artificially) will decay naturally back to the unexcited form,
<br>
still Hf-178, via emission of gamma radiation, so there is a radiological
<br>
hazard associated with the substance.  This transition is the one they
<br>
describe as having a half-life of 31 years.
<br>
