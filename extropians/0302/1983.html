<p><em>&gt; This is something that has been of interest to me for a while. Such traits

</em><br>
<p>The statistics regarding lactose intolerance are probably the best evidence
<br>
that humans are not yet adapted to dairy products. The National Institutes
<br>
of Health (NIH) estimates that about 25% of the adult Americans are &quot;lactose
<br>
intolerant,&quot; which the NIH defines as the condition of having &quot;low lactase
<br>
levels.&quot; (Lactase is the enzyme that metabolizes lactose, aka milk sugar).
<br>
<p>In my view adult Americans do not have &quot;low lactase levels.&quot; It is far more
<br>
accurate to state that we consume unnaturally high levels of lactose. Humans
<br>
normally and naturally reduce production of lactase around age two, at which
<br>
time we should be weaned of our mother's milk.
<br>
<p>Certain ethnic and racial groups are even less adapted to dairy: as many as
<br>
75% of adult African Americans and adult Native Americans, and 90% of adult
<br>
Asian-Americans are &quot;lactose intolerant.&quot; These differences in lactose
<br>
intolerance rates in different races and ethnic groups is easy to explain:
<br>
dairy farming first appeared in Europe, and the majority of North Americans
<br>
are of European descent. The fewer the number of European ancestors one has,
<br>
the greater is the probability that one suffers from this imaginary man-made
<br>
disease called &quot;lactose intolerance.&quot;
<br>
<p>Still the average person tends to think dairy consumption is perfectly
<br>
natural and healthy. Americans in particular seem to think that cow's milk
<br>
is as American as baseball and apple pie. No doubt this perception is the
<br>
result of tradition and mass-marketing by the dairy industry (Got Milk?).
<br>
Yet actually dairy consumption is a very unnatural behavior. Homo sapiens is
<br>
the only species on earth to consume milk in adulthood. We're also the only
<br>
species on earth that steals the milk of other species. From a naturalist's
<br>
perspective, human consumption of dairy is a bizarre and almost vampire-like
<br>
behavior. It's no wonder such a significant percentage of  humans are
<br>
intolerant to dairy.
