<p><p><p>&lt;&lt;The shuttle programme has retarded science        
<br>
As early as the 1980s, it was clear that the shuttle had degenerated into a 
<br>
mere publicity billboard. That was why the Challenger was hurried into its 
<br>
fatal mission on the eve of Reagan's State of the Union speech. And that's 
<br>
why shuttles have since been frequently used to give joyrides to high-profile 
<br>
guests from friendly nations and ageing American politicians. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Most recently, the merging of the shuttle programme with the even more 
<br>
boondogglish International Space Station has further crippled real science. 
<br>
The first victim was the Superconducting Super-Collider, which, though 
<br>
costing only a tiny fraction of the manned space budget, would have been an 
<br>
instrument of incalculable importance to under-standing the physical world.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The SSC was considered a boondoogle, especially after the cost went from 2 to 
<br>
8 to 16 billion dollars (1992 money) and the political support crashed. Would 
<br>
this construction have resulted in &quot;an instrument of incalculable importance 
<br>
to understanding the physical word&quot;?? Perhaps the maligned space station may 
<br>
yet prove useful in observations of the earth and climate, energy resources 
<br>
(like should we burn methane hydrate to prevent methane release into the 
<br>
atmosphere?) The SSC could have opened doors to the universe, or merely been 
<br>
a good place to work for a particle physicist. Any bets?
