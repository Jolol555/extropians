<p><em>&gt; Let us cut to the chase, if we may, and re-direct the emphasis of this thread. I say the war will occur soon any way, no matter
</em><br>
what the protestors say or do. I am in the pro-war camp, myself, though I cry my crocodile tears, I see no other way out of this.
<br>
Big freakin' deal right? Fair enough.  Now what will those anti-War camp do now?
<br>
<p>*Violent protests?
<br>
*A reign of molotov cocktails ?
<br>
*Sit-ins ?
<br>
*Laying on tracks carrying military equipment ?
<br>
*A stern letter to the Times ?
<br>
*Death threats, pipe bombs ?
<br>
*Denial of service email attacks ?
<br>
*taking up arms against the American Imperialists ?
<br>
*Making common cause with the Iraqis, the Iranians,
<br>
the North Koreans?
<br>
<p>I am curious about this.  How can you compel the US to obey
<br>
your will?  What about breaking diplomatic relations, economic
<br>
warfare of some sort?
<br>
&lt;
<br>
<p>Hal posted about &quot;stealth democracy&quot; and the researchers
<br>
he quoted had me pegged pretty well: I wouldn't make (myself)
<br>
a great study of policy issues confronting my country, but
<br>
rather trust people whose ideology is close to mine, and
<br>
who are presumably paid professionals.
<br>
<p>But my *attitude* towards, say, France or Germany invading
<br>
Bosnia would have been &quot;What affair is it of my country?
<br>
That's in Europe.&quot;  To be honest, I felt the same way about
<br>
Russia and Chechnya.  So one other item to put on the table
<br>
is, &quot;Perhaps other nations should mind their own business.
<br>
What happens in Iraq doesn't *directly* concern them.*
<br>
<p>Now I must quickly say that of course, talk is cheap and
<br>
everyone (including other countries, of course) is quite
<br>
entitled to their opinion.  But from the way some sound,
<br>
it's as if they regard the upcoming invasion as taking
<br>
place on their own soil!
<br>
<p>As for &quot;today, yes, it's Iraq, but tomorrow it may be Iceland&quot;,
<br>
that is so silly it hardly deserves comment.  I can just see
<br>
ten years of pressure from dozens and dozens of countries,
<br>
innumerable U.N. resolutions, thousands of flights over
<br>
Iceland to figure out just what those scoundrels are up to,
<br>
etc., etc.  ;-)
