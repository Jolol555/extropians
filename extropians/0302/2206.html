</em><br>
<p><p>No. Well actually I have been a functionalist as long as I can remember.
<br>
<p>What happened was more of a Eureka moment, where everything clicked, and 
<br>
the idea became second nature. You know, when you become totally 
<br>
comfortable with it. Not just being intellectually aware of it.
<br>
<p>The idea that you can create a universe by writing with a pen on paper, 
<br>
following a simple set of rules, and that intelligence and life could 
<br>
exists in that universe. Furthermore, if we did not make some kind of 
<br>
interface to this universe, it would have no way of knowing that we 
<br>
existed. Eerie.
<br>
<p>But if we believe that uploading is possible, this is a logical conclusion.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But can you get information without matter? The more I have studied
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; be encoded/implemented in matter of some kind to remain.
</em><br>
<p><p>I will agree if you have a very wide definition of matter :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;So the amusing thing is that, given enough time, it should be possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to run a program with a pencil, on a piece paper, that has intelligence 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;'creature'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or rather, it is indefinitely suspended. A bit like placed in stasis. 
</em><br>
<p><p>Well until that paper, and thus the state of the life, decomposed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I saw a paper suggesting that the spontaneous creation of computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viruses was not as small as commonly believed; with computers with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crashing code and memory overwrites simple viruses could presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop on their own and start propagating. Not the likeliest occurence, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but once it happened it would spread. Cyberspace is on the other hand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already crammed with replicators, so it would probably be out-competed.
</em><br>
<p><p>We must make an AGreenpeace immediately! All that Linux stuff that 
<br>
doesn't crash is destroyng the virtual ecosystem! It must be stopped. I 
<br>
am once again a Windows man!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The step towards thinking is another thing. Again, there is too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;pollution&quot; from outside sources to make it visible if it exists. Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one should start a SDI project: the Search for Digital Intelligence. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SDI@Home to analyse net traffic?
</em><br>
<p>There is defenitly a few complexity bumps along the way towards 
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>First level is process. (Which is what happens i Conways 'life'.)
<br>
Then there is life.
<br>
Then there is intelligence.
<br>
<p>I certainly didn't mean that we could create a &quot;universe on paper&quot; from 
<br>
any set of rules. It would still have to be a very complex programme. 
<br>
But ask Eliezer about that ;-)
