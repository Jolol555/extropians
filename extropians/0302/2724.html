<p>I have a plan called &quot;White Doves over Bhagdad&quot;. Considering global
<br>
positioning system (GPS) and three feet precision of a cruise missile it
<br>
should be possible to get some hollywood technicians to build an armada of
<br>
white GPS doves, stuff their belly with a micro engine, some camera and
<br>
some conventional plastic explosive material. The doves should be looking
<br>
pretty natural, so you start them off a destroyer and let them fly
<br>
&quot;peacefully&quot; with remote control until they reach Bhagdad.
<br>
<p>They should be able to move their wings as naturally as
<br>
possible so they won't attract attention. They could fly unto the
<br>
window-sills of all the bathrooms in Saddams palace, sit there, and execute
<br>
their cooing- and picking program while observing the bathroom all the 
<br>
time, wait until the dicator slips in to digest his breakfast and then - in
<br>
Germany we say: RUMS (with a short &quot;u&quot; as in butcher) -  the peace dove
<br>
breaks though the window with its diamond beak and drops its explosives 
<br>
while Saddam drops HIS explosives simultaneously. What an appealing 
<br>
way to die for an asshole like him.
<br>
<p>Now THAT would be an impressive stroke. There could be a whole swarm 
<br>
of doves trying it again if the first attempt should fail. But I hear, the 
<br>
US/UK invasion force plans to shoot ten times as much ammunition on 
<br>
the first day of war as in Desert Storm One. That battle of material
<br>
does not impress me. They could do way better with 
<br>
<p>&quot;White Doves over Bhagdad&quot;
