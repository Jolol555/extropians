<p>Yes, the one in question was, though it is not the same one I use here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the only challenge is getting your password.  It probably wasn't

</em><br>
<p>I know better than to answer a question like that online. ;-) The password
<br>
in question is still &quot;out there,&quot; though I have changed my email
<br>
addresses/usernames/passwords on the sites that concern me most.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This person then impersonated me on the relevant site and used the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That sucks.  No matter what, that's a real drag.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; My PC is generally not physically accessible to anyone other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you mean by &quot;generally&quot;?  How often is your PC physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accessible to someone else?  Once a week?  Once a month?
</em><br>
<p>Basically, never. I can't think of a time that anyone had access to this
<br>
computer without my close supervision, which is not to say it's never
<br>
happened.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Occam's Razor would say your little conspiracy theory is a bit unlikely.
</em><br>
<p>If you knew more about my life and the placement of my computer then I think
<br>
you find my remote keylogging theory to be the best explanation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I am running Windows XP Home Edition. Until a couple of week ago I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; connected 24/7 via DSL, but in the last few weeks I have been using
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; h0 h0 h0!  Windows XP 0wned Edition connected 24/7 by DSL.  I bet you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably didn't keep up with the latest security patches as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately came out, did you?
</em><br>
<p>Actually I do. I'm set up to automatically download and install every patch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did you know enough to rename your owner account?  And put a password on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it?
</em><br>
<p>I've had several different user accounts on my own PC over several different
<br>
installations, each one a renamed admin account. One of them used the same
<br>
password as that used on the hacked site. Stealth software capable of
<br>
recovering that owner password would have helped the hacker.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyone running Windows XP (Home or Pro, but /especially/ XP Home) should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least glance over this web page at least three times:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     <a href="http://www.blackviper.com/WinXP/supertweaks.htm">http://www.blackviper.com/WinXP/supertweaks.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Specifically, number 12 which I'll quote here:
</em><br>
<p>Very interesting (and another thing to be alarmed about).
<br>
<p>However I don't believe I've ever used the default owner/admin account
<br>
without first renaming it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I were a betting person, I'd bet you a nickel that you got socially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineered or shoulder surfed, and not keylogged.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, social engineering is quite possible, as is shoulder surfing, though
<br>
I'm usually extremely careful about the latter.
<br>
<p>In case I haven't made it clear, my focus on anti-keylogging is due in part
<br>
to the fact that I have another password, one which I use for high security
<br>
purposes (e.g., encryption of data files). I'm most concerned about that
<br>
password, and it's not one that would normally be accessible via such things
<br>
as social engineering and shoulder surfing. Probably only a keylogger could
<br>
capture it, because I use it only rarely, (never on websites), and because I
<br>
am in general very careful about its use.
<br>
<p>Thanks for all your advice.
<br>
