<em>&gt; (Lee Corbin &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20Anniversary%20of%20Roe%20v.%20Wade">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, it's startling the aplomb with which you dismiss the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire strict-constructionist view.
</em><br>
<p>Because the strict constructionist view is inherently
<br>
dishonest.  The ninth and tenth amendments are very clear,
<br>
and they were put there for a very good reason: because
<br>
the framers knew the moment they started putting human
<br>
rights on paper, some idiot would come along and say
<br>
&quot;This one wasn't written down, so it must not exist&quot;.
<br>
<p>It is entirely appropriate--indeed, it is an ethical
<br>
mandate--for the court to enforce rights that are part
<br>
of our culture but which may not have been enumerated
<br>
in 1789.  There's no written constitutional right for
<br>
me to marry a black woman, or to buy a condom, or to
<br>
school my own children; but the court has rightly
<br>
recognized that laws that restricted those things were
<br>
repugnant to our notions of freedom, and stripped the
<br>
federal government, and the states, of their power to
<br>
oppress the people in those ways.  An honest &quot;strict
<br>
constructionist&quot; would have to favor reinstating those
<br>
laws that have been soundly rejected as being against
<br>
basic human freedom.
<br>
