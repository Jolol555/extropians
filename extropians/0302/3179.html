<p><em>&gt; &gt; Are you sure that any exterior *power* really has the ability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to do such farsighted surgery on a nation, and change its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; culture in the process?  It would be instructive to consider 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cases in world history where this has been done.  Do you know of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure.  The US in Japan.  China in its own rural areas.  Rome in its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provinces.  Heck, Britain in large swaths of the world!  
</em><br>
<p>Mike Lorrey had a wonderful phrase, that I can't find, for
<br>
what happened to the mind-set in Germany and Japan.  But
<br>
I'm speaking of &quot;working&quot; society models as opposed to
<br>
models that aren't &quot;working&quot;.  China and Rome retained
<br>
these areas as part of an empire---no one wants that.
<br>
Britain too, although what happened in India over the
<br>
course of 200 years might be a good model.  Yet even there,
<br>
look what happened as soon as they left.
<br>
<p>But you make a good point, at least vis-a-vis some place
<br>
like India.  The people there did pick up democracy.
<br>
<p>But take the Philippines, for example.  The Americans
<br>
ruled there for decades.  Then independence was granted,
<br>
and 26 years later there was Marcos:
<br>
<a href="http://www.tribo.org/history/history2.html">http://www.tribo.org/history/history2.html</a>
<br>
<p>But tell us more about Egypt.  Have you read Hernando
<br>
DeSoto's book &quot;The Mystery of Capitalism&quot;?  He tries
<br>
hard to explain the poverty of Egypt, even given the
<br>
peace and support over the past decades.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 1. The legal rights of individuals must be sacrosanct,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    and all individuals must be equal before the law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2. Government corruption must be minimal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3. Private property must be totally respected under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    the law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 4. Private property must be an integral part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    legal system, and publicly registered.  This includes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    all businesses and real estate.  (This is DeSoto's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    conclusion after 20 years' study.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 5. A high level of trust for others outside one's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    family must be achievable, otherwise it is not possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    to create firms of any size.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a great list.  I would certainly add to this list - education
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and infrastructure both accelerate growth.  I'd also note that every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; item on the list you have above boils down to the rule of law.
</em><br>
<p>Outstanding perception.  I'm just starting Bethell's &quot;The Noblest
<br>
Triumph&quot;, which explains that its law that influences economy,
<br>
not, as everyone for 150 has been supposing, the other way around.
<br>
And law should be mostly about *property*.  He explains utterly
<br>
convincingly the central and fundamental importance of private
<br>
property, and is even able to explain England's origin of the
<br>
industrial revolution and other kinds of progress:  they happened
<br>
to have the most secure individual property rights in Europe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To establish that rule of law in Iraq is going to take time and patience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the part of the US.  If we install a new government and leave, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; odds are against the establishment of the rule of law any time soon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we stick around for years and maybe even multiple decades, we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help establish it.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you are right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My question again is:  Does the US have the commitment to stick around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Iraq long enough to establish a stable and prosperous democracy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is (mostly) not about money - it's about US presence in the area.
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea.  Supposing for a moment that you are right about
<br>
this, we have to understand that the U.S. might take a lot of
<br>
heat about such &quot;colonialization&quot; or &quot;imperialism&quot;.  Still, there
<br>
is the oil ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee, I think [your] argument boils down to &quot;Muslims aren't cut out for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy&quot;.  I think the evidence is otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I did regret that after I posted it, because it had that
<br>
implication.  I stand corrected.  I agree that it seems that
<br>
Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and several other countries in the region
<br>
can progress.  Doesn't it come down to whether the people can
<br>
outgrow fundamentalism?  I cannot quite call to mind an
<br>
interesting analysis that said those countries break down
<br>
in a 2x2 array: one dimension was modernity.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Pro-democracy forces in Iran were steadily making headway in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the country until Bush energized their fundamentalist foes with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;axis of evil&quot; and a first-strike policy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A desire for self-rule is a basic part of humans.  Most Arabs hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their corrupt, dictatorial governments, and for good reason.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they need is help from a strong democratic power like the US to help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; install and shepherd democracy in their countries.
