<p>Guess what - it has happened, and all over the world. I remember reading
<br>
a case in UK where they rented a flat overlooking the ATM and used
<br>
high-power binoculars to read the PIN numbers. Another member of the
<br>
gang collected the receipts that people often throw away after
<br>
withdrawing cash. Do a Google search on ATM + binoculars and you'll see
<br>
people have been warning about this for years.
<br>
A new technique to me was using a camcorder to film people keying-in PIN
<br>
numbers.
<br>
<p>Being mugged after a cash withdrawal is still the most common crime,
<br>
though, in UK. Much easier for lower IQ criminals.
<br>
<p>Did you see the latest news item about a technique that can guess a
<br>
customer's PIN number in about 15 tries?

<br>
<p>Personally, the 'phantom withdrawals' problem is the reason why I have
<br>
never, ever, used a cash machine. The banks insist that that their
<br>
machines are error free and it is up to me to prove that I did or did
<br>
not make any specific withdrawal. The convenience is just not worth all
<br>
that hassle for me.
<br>
<p>Best wishes, BillK
