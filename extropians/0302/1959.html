<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; 3. Visionary Physicist, Freeman Dyson (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opposed to other physicists who merely collect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; checks) notes that certain big projects supported
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by governments, tend to be projects where one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot afford to fail. The Shuttle is but one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these, the dirigibles of the 1920's and 1930's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were another. One of the reasons, Dyson gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the triumph of the airplane over the dirigible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is that planes were robust, and their technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; advanced extremely rapidly, compared to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dirigible. &gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'm not so convinced that airships are bad players. Popular
<br>
Science had a cover article on airships with nuclear engines
<br>
once.
<br>
<p>With a suitable power source and helium lifting capacity
<br>
[if indeed hydrogen is that risky, but let's assume so] they
<br>
offer a good alternative to trucks and rail. Possibly (?) even
<br>
the Iain Banks etc. idea of the vaccuum balloon (with nano
<br>
materials) could be put to work with an airship, even if
<br>
compartmentalized.
<br>
<p>It's always a good idea to conserve energy where it's easy.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't be at all surprised to see the 70s ideas of airships
<br>
and ships with added computer-controlled sails built out of
<br>
new nano materials and automated computer controls and
<br>
utilizing the trade winds and sea currents.
<br>
<p>Even assemblers of all types will need different elements,
<br>
minerals transported.
<br>
-------------------------
<br>
Of course, between short distances (cities) it may be possible
<br>
to use dipping vacuum maglev tunnels powered by thermal energy
<br>
and utilizing gravity and lack of friction to go most of the way (and
<br>
then be locked into position and not fall back again, going the last bit
<br>
under the thermally generated power. [Or variants on this.]
<br>
-------------------------
<br>
Larry Niven's Destiny's Road had foam-packed ship hull molds...
<br>
makes me wonder about ships and nano-materials hulls, voiding them
<br>
with vacuum for greater buoyancy.
