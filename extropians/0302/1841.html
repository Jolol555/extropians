<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; little different than one might first assume. Huh? Surely if you tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; oil, the price goes up. Perhaps, perhaps not. Here is my reasoning:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; i.   Tax oil *at the barrel* (i.e. not at the pump)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ii.   Prices of oil based products; fuel, plastics, etc. naturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; rise. iii.  Alternatives to oil based products appear a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;      cheaper. I.e. wood or metal instead of plastic, bicycling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;      instead of driving etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; iv.  Some consumption shifts away from oil to alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; v.   Demand for oil decreases slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; vi.  To maintain revenues oil producers drop prices a little (*)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, assume for a minute that the increased tax revenues taken in by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; taxing the oil are used to displace some other tax burden (yes, yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; an unlikely scenario). Then:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a.   The nation sees no net change in the tax burden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; b.   The nation sees a net decrease in the price of oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; c.   The oil producing country has a little less income from oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The net effect: a reduction in the price of oil from the nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; perspective. I.e. by taxing crude oil an oil importing country can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; trim some of the windfall profits from the oil exporting country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### The net effect would be a reduction in economic efficiency - instead
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; using cheap oil, and having more resources left for e.g. science, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leisure, the economy (meaning every company and every individual) would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spend resources (time, energy, scientific effort) to reduce energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consumption (forgoing some pleasures, like having a well-lit home, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; warm bedroom), or produce more costly energy. At the same time, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oil-producing country would have less money to spend on products made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the oil user, reducing trade, and reducing economic activity in both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; countries. A clear loss for all parties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An important part of my scenario is the displacement of one type of tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (income tax) with another type of tax (the tax on oil). There is no *net*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional burden in what I described so there is no reason for every
</em><br>
company
<br>
<em>&gt; and every individual to expend resources in reducing energy consumption.
</em><br>
<p>### If gas costs .85 $/gallon, I can drive to visit my wife in Pittsburgh
<br>
and still have money left to invest in a high-tech company. If you increase
<br>
the cost of gas to 5 $/gallon, as in Europe, I won't be able to drive 700
<br>
miles a week, or else I'll have to reduce investment for the future, or
<br>
otherwise diminish spending on what I enjoy. I have to reduce energy use, or
<br>
spend more money obtaining it. There will be a small benefit from me not
<br>
paying other taxes, but it will be smaller than the loss I incur. My income
<br>
is taxed anyway, but with an income tax I am free to decide what to do with
<br>
what I have left. With a commodity tax, my decisions are manipulated away
<br>
from the use of the commodity - I not only have less money, but also less
<br>
freedom to use it as I see fit - I cannot spend it on driving (or else I pay
<br>
a higher individual tax burden), I have to spend it on something else.
<br>
<p>Every time you reduce economic efficiency by taxes, there is a *net* burden,
<br>
because the benefit you get from spending the tax-derived funds is almost
<br>
always lower than the benefit from spending on your own. The only exceptions
<br>
are defense, science, information-provision, and certain types of limited
<br>
welfare.
<br>
<p>The only type of taxes that does not reduce economic effieciency are taxes
<br>
which do not distort the free market, like universal transaction taxes, to a
<br>
lesser extent income taxes. Much as I oppose income tax, it is less
<br>
destructive than a commodity tax.
<br>
<p>--------------------
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Unless it happens the companies and individuals see an opportunity to keep
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; little more money in their pockets by cutting back in their consumption of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those oil based products (note - not just energy). Remember, supposedly
</em><br>
those
<br>
<em>&gt; companies and individuals paid as much less in income taxes as the
</em><br>
additional
<br>
<em>&gt; amount they are paying on the oil based products.
</em><br>
<p>### No, not really. Some companies are more dependent on gas, so they will
<br>
end up paying higher taxes. Some individuals live farther from their
<br>
workplace - they end up paying more. In essence, you are redistributing tax
<br>
burdens to certain groups of people, making their products more expensive.
<br>
In response, every individual starts competing in reducing his own taxes by
<br>
cutting the use of oil. Instead of living pleasantly in a suburb, many
<br>
poorer people would be again forced back into cities. Businesses relying on
<br>
gas, like car makers, would be weakened, but coal mines would be
<br>
strengthened, by increased use of trains fueled by electricity from
<br>
coal-fired power plants. Pollution would go up, the difficulty of traveling
<br>
would increase, the comfort level would go down. A lot less people would be
<br>
able to afford home-delivered pizza.
<br>
<p>This always happens if you interfere with the free market, other than as to
<br>
provide information and prevent monopolies.
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You could use the same reasoning regarding e.g. taxes on bananas. Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bananas can be produced only in countries with the right climate, they
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a windfall, like oil, with growing of bananas being like pumping of oil,
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mere exploitation of a natural resource. I hope you can see the analogy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One might want to cut the windfall profits and spur domestic fruit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; production by taxing bananas - but why do it? Trade, whether in bananas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oil, manufactured goods, or &quot;natural products&quot;, is good. No need to kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the goose laying golden eggs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't apply this reasoning to bananas since there are no windfall
</em><br>
profits
<br>
<em>&gt; in bananas. The price of a banana on the shelf in an American store
</em><br>
reflects
<br>
<em>&gt; the labor of the growers, shipping costs and not a whole lot else. Banana
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growers do o.k. but they aren't raking in billions of windfall profits to
</em><br>
my
<br>
<em>&gt; knowledge. The revenue made by the oil producing nations on the other hand
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; largely windfall and only a tiny fraction is in infrastructure investment
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; labor.
</em><br>
<p>### If bananas were as indipensable as oil, and all banana fields were
<br>
nationalized as oil-fields are, banana growers *would* rake in exactly the
<br>
same profits as oil-producers do. The main difference between bananas and
<br>
oil, economically, is that without bananas you can live well, but without
<br>
oil you are in trouble. This, and the nationalization of oil reserves, is
<br>
responsible for the &quot;windfall&quot;. If multiple, freely-competing transnational
<br>
oil companies still owned oil fields as in the beginning of last century, in
<br>
other words, if there was a free market in oil, the profit margin on oil
<br>
would not be any higher than the profit on coal, or any other mature
<br>
commodity.
<br>
<p>The way of dealing with the absence of the free market in an economic field
<br>
is not to make it even less resembling the free market. As long as the
<br>
market is controlled by non-economical means (state ownership of oil in
<br>
theMiddle East and just about everywhere else), you can't do anything about
<br>
it. Reducing your own economic efficiency by taxing yourself won't help -
<br>
costs you more to cut oil use, than you &quot;gain&quot; by cutting the foreign
<br>
powers' &quot;windfall&quot; income.
<br>
<p>BTW, I do have some sympathy with Georgism, especially regarding the problem
<br>
of land ownership, but the idea of interfering in the free market for social
<br>
reasons is IMO totally wrong.
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Say no to commodity taxes!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree, except when a hugh part of the money being spent on that comodity
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; a massive windfall to whomever controls the resource and not money going
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; reward the labors of people creating the comodity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, personally I'd trade income tax for windfall taxes any day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
###Basically, you want to punish the guys who just happen to sit on oil. You
<br>
are using the Equality Matching model here, where the Market Pricing model
<br>
is superior (to use Fiske's terminology). The market does not exist to
<br>
reward virtue, it is meant to optimize prices and production.
