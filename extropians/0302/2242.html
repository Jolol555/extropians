Parkinson's disease: gold standard drug causes heart problems
<br>
<p>Research has shown that levodopa can increase the risk of heart disease in
<br>
Parkinson's patients.
<br>
January 30, 2003 3:58 PM GMT (Datamonitor) - A study published in the Archives
<br>
of Neurology suggests a link between levodopa and increased homocysteine
<br>
levels. This new evidence of adverse side effects will increase the demand for
<br>
treatments that can delay the need for levodopa. Competition will be strong in
<br>
the $2 billion market and Pharmacia and GSK are leading the way with their
<br>
dopamine agonists Mirapex and Requip respectively.
<br>
<p>People with Parkinson's disease (PD) who take the drug levodopa appear to have
<br>
a higher than average risk of heart disease, according to researchers at the
<br>
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
<br>
However, researchers stress it is not clear whether levodopa itself raises
<br>
heart disease risks. Experts believe these preliminary findings &quot;raise certain
<br>
concerns&quot; about the safety of levodopa, but are not meant to discourage people
<br>
from taking the drug.
<br>
PD affects over 560,000 people in the US. It is a progressive, degenerative
<br>
condition of the central nervous system, characterized by symptoms such as
<br>
tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement and postural instability. Levodopa 
<br>
works
<br>
by replacing levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain, although
<br>
continued use is associated with undesirable movement side effects known as
<br>
dyskinesias. Moreover, the treatment cannot slow disease progression and works
<br>
only to alleviate the symptoms.
<br>
After experiencing a relatively static five years, the PD market is set to 
<br>
grow
<br>
with the recent emphasis on the dopamine agonist class of drugs, which are now
<br>
recommended as first-line monotherapy. The leading players, GlaxoSmithKline 
<br>
and
<br>
Pharmacia, will drive this growth with ReQuip (ropinirole) and Mirapex
<br>
(pramipexole) respectively.
<br>
The market is also set to expand with the emergence of revolutionary
<br>
combination drug strategies that aim to reduce levodopa induced motor
<br>
fluctuations and dyskinesias, as well as neuroprotective therapies that delay
<br>
disease progression.
<br>
Levodopa remains the gold standard treatment of PD, despite being over 30 
<br>
years
<br>
old and the emergence of new drug classes. It is now highly generacized,
<br>
although controlled release versions of Roche's Madopar and BMS-DuPont's
<br>
Sinemet are popular levodopa therapies in Europe and US respectively.
<br>
Even so, the high volume of sales means the market for levodopa therapies is
<br>
worth over a billion dollars. This new evidence to suggest a heightened 
<br>
risk of
<br>
heart disease will increase the need for therapies that can further delay
<br>
levodopa treatment.
