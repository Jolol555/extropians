BillK mentions the paper which Serafino found here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301184">http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301184</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;If time moves along like business as usual even at Planck scales,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, you have to reconcile the Big Bang model with an event that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't just off the scale, it's infinite!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The real issue here is that this is supposed to be a test of quantum
<br>
gravity.  According to that theory, uncertainty in space and time is
<br>
present at the smallest scales, giving the universe a somewhat granular
<br>
nature.  This can be reflected in principle in the propagation of light
<br>
over galactic distances.  Lieu and Hillman claim that this should destroy
<br>
interference patterns on such photons, in contrast to observations.
<br>
<p>However I found a Usenet post which pointed to two papers which deny
<br>
this conclusion,
<br>
<p><a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0302333">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0302333</a>
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0302372">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0302372</a>
<br>
<p>Both claim that the authors made a mistake.  (I just read the abstracts.)
<br>
The first argues that the &quot;kind&quot; of interference is relevant, that
<br>
what you see through the telescope is wavefront-based and will not
<br>
be destroyed by quantum gravity, rather you need an amplitude-based
<br>
interference detector like a Michelson interferometer.  The second paper
<br>
makes a similar point, arguing that the authors &quot;vastly overestimated&quot;
<br>
the destruction of phase coherence in this system.
<br>
<p>I suspect that the critics are right.  I recently read Lee Smolin's
<br>
book, Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, and he mentioned some possible
<br>
tests of the theory based on long-travelled photons.  They are subtle
<br>
effects, though.  If the bare existence of interference fringes was that
<br>
sensitive a test of quantum gravity, people would have figured it out
<br>
a long time ago.
