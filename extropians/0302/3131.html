<em>&gt; Hmm.  Perhaps that's not such a bad idea!  Now it's incontestible

</em><br>
<em>&gt; oh, wait, no, that was 1945.  Even longer ago.  But does that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, the U.S. says it does, just to intimidate everybody.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But can they really be trusted?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, since we've had verification, inspection, and destruction
<br>
activities going on jointly with Russia for more than a decade now,
<br>
which has been open to UN IAEC scrutiny, to comply with START treaty
<br>
measures, the US can be trusted far more than any other nation.
<br>
<p>Now, I've seen US WMD, back in the late 1980s, and I knew lots of
<br>
people who worked on them daily for many years.
<br>
<p>Given that career bureaucrats the world over have a constitutional
<br>
propensity to need to document every activity that every individual
<br>
within their organization engages in, it would be very hard to prove
<br>
that the US has no WMD. Any idiot with a google can find diagrams,
<br>
photos, and testimony online. To presume that this is all a put-on is
<br>
assuming a conspiracy larger than Manhattan Project, Magic/Enigma, and
<br>
the Stealth projects combined.
