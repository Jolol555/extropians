<p>### Anders, this is exactly what I meant. I do oppose the current role of
<br>
the FDA, Lee, and I think all patients should have the unencumbered ability
<br>
to use any therapies the market can offer. The only role for the
<br>
Professional Bodies you mention should be assuring that the patients are
<br>
offered full, unbiased information about the therapy - whether they decide
<br>
to heed warnings or go with their hopes, should be up to them. In the case
<br>
of cell implants for PD, so far the risks seem to outweigh the benefits -
<br>
but then, of course, some adventurers might think otherwise, and put their
<br>
own basal ganglia on the line.
