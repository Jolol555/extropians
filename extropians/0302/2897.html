<p>
Any suggestions as to how to obtain?
<br>
<p>Best Source?
<br>
<p>And what the estimated monthly cost of supplementation would be?
<br>
<p>Did I read earlier it had to be injected?

Subject: RE: Performance enhancement with selegiline
<br>
<p><p><p>Rafal,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Good for you! I really have no problem with the promotion of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deprenyl as a nootropic, since here you present evidence of better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality, a double-blind randomized trial.
</em><br>
<p>Well that's certainly a refreshing change of tune from you, Rafal. 
<br>
<p>A few messages ago you were telling me that this drug was a waste of
<br>
time and money. You even suggested indirectly that my way of thinking
<br>
could kill people (re: my comparison of DATATOP to the recent halted
<br>
study of female HRT).
<br>
<p>One of the problems inherent in this discussion (Robert Bradbury, take
<br>
note) is that selegiline (deprenyl) is thought to have so many benefits
<br>
that it is difficult to pin down. There are many sub-topics worth
<br>
debating:
<br>
<p>Is it likely to enhance cognitive ability in normal healthy humans? Is
<br>
it likely to enhance sex drive in normal healthy humans? Is it likely to
<br>
improve mood in normal healthy humans? Is it likely to protect neurons
<br>
from neurotoxins and excitotoxins in normal healthy humans? Is it likely
<br>
to improve life-expectancy in normal healthy humans?
<br>
<p>My answer is &quot;yes&quot; to all these questions, with varying degrees of
<br>
certainty. However my pro-selegiline position would not change even if I
<br>
were shown to be wrong about one or two of these questions.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately drug companies do not spend R&amp;D money in an effort to
<br>
improve the lives of normal healthy humans, so we are forced to base our
<br>
opinions on indirect data and personal experience. 
<br>
