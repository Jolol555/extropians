<p>Why?  I mean, why &quot;Just kidding!&quot;.  That it's currently non-feasible 
<br>
doesn't invalidate it as the better solution in the long term, and in 
<br>
the short term I don't see *any* viable solution, beyond putting up with 
<br>
it, and squabbling over the details.  (And cars really *are* a detail.  
<br>
They fill the same niche as the horse did earlier...but most people 
<br>
didn't own a horse [too expensive, too much upkeep].)
<br>
<p>O'Neil's design class decided that a planetary surface was not the 
<br>
proper place for an expanding industrial civilization.  I haven't seen 
<br>
anything happen since then that invalidates their decision.  It's just 
<br>
that there are a few technical details that need to be solved before 
<br>
their proposed solution can be implemented.
<br>
<p>P.S.:  Don't expect space colonies to be libertarian.  This strikes me 
<br>
as quite unlikely.  They need to be well managed.  But totalitarian also 
<br>
seems undesireable.  They will probably require some new social 
<br>
organization modeled on a decentralized control system.  Probably a 
<br>
derivitive of a neural net, where people establish their desires via 
<br>
interaction with governmental surveys on their own computer, and the 
<br>
government decides how to implement that decision.  As to how that 
<br>
decision and implementation is done ... that rather depends on just how 
<br>
advanced computer intelligence becomes before space colonies are built.  
<br>
Elected officials seem to be even more corruptable, and on a larger 
<br>
scale, than the US constitution writers feared.   Possibly some 
<br>
variation of the Austrailian system (many who are exposed to it in 
<br>
operation seem to approve of it), combined with instant recall elections 
<br>
via on-line petition.  This should eliminate the more distasteful 
<br>
candidates before they are ever elected, and if one is elected, a quick 
<br>
recall threat should keep them at least moderately in line.  But a 
<br>
recall petition should always and automatically be active, and one 
<br>
should be able to both add and remove one's name from the petition.  If 
<br>
it hits 50%, he's immediately out of office, and there needs to be 
<br>
another election (so make elections easy and cheap!  On-line is the only 
<br>
real choice here.  But use open-source, so everyone has the potential to 
<br>
determine that it's doing what it claims, and the days equivalant of ssh 
<br>
and pgp, so that people can sign their votes, verify them, and still 
<br>
remain anonymous).
<br>
<p>This proposal isn't perfect, but it should be relatively cheap, and a 
<br>
space colony will be relatively small.  And if anyone is so unhappy that 
<br>
they find death better, they have a good chance of being able to take 
<br>
everyone else with them.  So you need to be careful, but still do your 
<br>
best to keep people happy.
