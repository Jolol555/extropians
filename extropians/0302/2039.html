<em>&gt;        Yes, I think ridiculous is a fair fit to your position.
</em><br>
<p>You know what? I think your blinkers now have closed to a blindfold right 
<br>
before your eyes. Your world is so black and white, with no alternatives 
<br>
that there's no place left for rational thinking. You are not acting 
<br>
transhuman, but inhuman at most. Your brain is more busy to insult 
<br>
everyone who doesn't share your opinion, than to really understand the 
<br>
situation. What a wonderful demonstration of how thin the layer of 
<br>
civilization is, when primitive emotions are involved. And what a 
<br>
wonderful demonstration, how &quot;transhuman&quot; you really are, raving like a 
<br>
trained dog let lose. Where are all the great ideas about nanotech, 
<br>
high-tech, etc.? Only idle sofa chatter? Your transhumanity only reaches 
<br>
as far as to invent weapons, but isn't capable of thinking within social 
<br>
systems. Maybe they are too complicated for such a technocratic mind. 
<br>
Seems it only needs some TV programs to make a &quot;transhuman&quot; grab a club 
<br>
and become a neandertaler again.
<br>
<p>I'll try to leave this discussion now. We all will see in a few months 
<br>
that nothing will be solved, everything will be messed up and if there 
<br>
will be any winners, it will be the oil companies, not you and not me. 
<br>
There will be more threats, which will need more money, which we'll all 
<br>
miss for more sensibly things. In the end it will be the same game as in 
<br>
Afghanistan: An unfinished job, and the real foes will gather right after 
<br>
the troops have left - like they do just now in Afghanistan.
