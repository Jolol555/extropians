</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) The lunatic fringe of the anti war movement is far crazier than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lunatic fringe of the pro war movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) It's counterintuitive but for some strange reason the war supporters seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like nicer people that the anti war crowd; that doesn't mean they're right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't have these conclusions.  I think he does not in any way 
<br>
want to see a nuke exploded in any US city.  It looks to me like 
<br>
he said what he did out of sheer frustration that this war will 
<br>
go steaming on probably no matter what.  It is gallows humor 
<br>
(well, darker than that) of maybe we will learn something.  But 
<br>
the whole tone is that he doubts that.  I think that drawing too 
<br>
much out of that last paragraph is a bit strained.  It is 
<br>
certainly not justified to assume he has gone nuts or is in any 
<br>
&quot;lunatic fringe&quot;.
<br>
<p>Some of the pro-war stuff about making Iraq a glass ashtray and 
<br>
stuff was illegally horrific.  Or are we only horrified and lose 
<br>
any sense of perspective if we are talking about American lives?
<br>
<p>The war supporters are certainly NOT &quot;nicer people&quot;.
