In a message dated 2/1/2003 4:55:28 AM Central Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Time.com%20asks%20you%20to%20vote%20for%20most%20dangerous%20country">samantha@objectent.com</a> writes: The thing about terrorism is that it can come 
<br>
from most any corner with sufficient rage and suprisingly little financing.  
<br>
It doesn't require a Saddam. Getting rid of him will do nothing to decrease 
<br>
terrorism.  Most likely it will increase it.
<br>
<p>The sky is falling, the sky is falling.  You know I used to listen to folks 
<br>
just like you before every amateur boxing match I was ever in.  A bunch of 
<br>
&quot;Job's Comforters&quot; would invariably come sidling up to me to tell me what a 
<br>
dangerous thing I was doing to fight who ever it was.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned two things from that.  Despite their pretense they 
<br>
invariably were my opponents friends in on sense or another.  That I should 
<br>
always listen carefully -- there was a good chance they would tip me off to a 
<br>
weakness that I hadn't learned otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't quite figured things out yet in this case but I am 
<br>
developing some questions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you (plural) have to keep returning to aged misrepresentations 
<br>
to tell your story?  Yesterday it was your (plural) silly contention that 
<br>
Sadaam had never attacked the US.  Of course he has and then lied about it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you (plural) keep contending that we are the ones that gave him 
<br>
his start?  He started as a simple hearted gunman for his political party.  
<br>
He was on the make and looking for opportunities to grow -- well, grow in his 
<br>
terms.  He at one point had to get out of Iraq so he went to Egypt as a guest 
<br>
of Nassar.  While there he courted the Soviet seeking power independent of 
<br>
his sponsors.  He went back to Iraq and courted both the CIA and the Soviet.  
<br>
We talked to him but little else.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you noticed that he has Russian tanks, Russian aircraft and while 
<br>
I don't know where he got his Scud missiles it certainly wasn't from the US.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is so foolish about your position is that it repeats the pattern 
<br>
the Socialists have made for the past 200 years.  You repeat the same old 
<br>
tactics time after time without any reference to reality.  You haven't 
<br>
changed your essential line since the protests back in the 30s.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough of that.  I have the pleasure of having a former Green Beret 
<br>
Major in my class.  He spent two or three tours in the Central highlands of 
<br>
Vietnam.  It is funny as all get out listening to him tell about his opponent 
<br>
over there as opposed to the one the Samantha's of the world described to us 
<br>
over here.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can locate one of those guys it would be well worth the price 
<br>
of a lunch to sit down listen.  The N. Vietnamese soldiers got very little 
<br>
food from the North.  They would get rice and shoot some animals out in the 
<br>
forest.  As a result they had a vitamin A deficiency and poor night vision.  
<br>
As they didn't have purifying tablets nor boil their water they frequently 
<br>
had internal parasites eating what little food they did get.  Finally they 
<br>
were mostly farmers or city boys that were more or less lost out in the 
<br>
woods.  As a consequence they never got far from the streams and you could 
<br>
always find them or evade them as required.  However, the sad truth was that 
<br>
on his first tour the SF was killing adult soldiers.  On his 2nd tour there 
<br>
was a large number of boys among those adults.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Samantha's of the world never notice that the Viet Cong was 
<br>
never heard of again after the Tet offensive.  We destroyed it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what has that got to do with Iraq?  It is the same thing.  Today 
<br>
Samantha is busy building the opposition up to be 10 feet tall.  The army 
<br>
that we destroyed in 3 days is now so fearsome that we dare not defend 
<br>
ourselves today.  The same people that delighted in seeing us bring Sadaam 
<br>
down a peg then is going to rise up in mass and smite us down today.  Heck in 
<br>
50 years of constantly trying they haven't even been able to bring down 
<br>
little Israel but we are helpless just the same.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However Samantha will have an effect -- possibly.  If she encourages 
<br>
Sadaam to resist us longer than he would have other wise then Samantha will 
<br>
have managed to get some people killed that would have lived otherwise.  That 
<br>
is certainly the lesson of Vietnam.  The Vietnamese say a million of their 
<br>
people died in that war while the North was being encouraged to hang on until 
<br>
the peaceniks could stop the resistance to their genocide.  Not pretty.
