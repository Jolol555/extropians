<em>&gt;&gt; Certainly NOT true, the atmospheric irritants emmited by the
</em><br>
combustion of coal, including
<br>
<p>Sulphur dioxide (SO2) - respiratory disorders, impaired breathing 
<br>
Nitrous oxide (NOx) - respiratory disorders, infections, pulmonary
<br>
diseases 
<br>
Carbon monoxide (CO) - fatal angina, various other effects 
<br>
Ozone (O3) - respiratory disorders, impaired breathing, asthma, edema 
<br>
Particulate matter (PM10) - various toxic particle (organic matter,
<br>
carbon, mineral dusts, metal oxides and sulphates and nitrate salts)
<br>
effects, main
<br>
mortality factor due to fossil fuels    
<br>
Toxic substances, heavy metals - specific substance effects  
<br>
<p>are estimated by the the WHO in its 1997 report on sustainable
<br>
development, to account for 6% of the total 50 million annual global
<br>
deaths.  That's approximately 3 million deaths *every year* from
<br>
atmospheric pollutants released from the combustion of fossil fuels.
<br>
These are real people dying real painful deaths every year.  3 million.
<br>
Outdoor air pollution in the U.S. due to particulate pollution alone was
<br>
estimated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1997 to cause
<br>
at least 20,000 premature deaths each year.  3rd world countries, many
<br>
of which cook on wood or dung fired stoves, fare much worse.
<br>
<p>(3) The by-products of coal mining can be put back without any hazard 
<br>
for the biosphere.
<br>
<p>Except for the billions of tons of harmful chemicals and radioactive
<br>
uranium dumped into the air.  Sure you got your facts straight on
<br>
nuclear power?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;===================
<br>
<p>I was under the impression that anyone who burned large volumes of coal
<br>
now was required to have
<br>
scrubbers in their smoke stacks that remove particalate matter from the
<br>
emissions.
<br>
<p>I could agree with the danger in third world countries but we had the
<br>
technology for several years to clean up the emissions.
<br>
<p>Do you know for a fact that the coal burning power plants do not use
<br>
this technology?
<br>
<p>I know the scrubbers are expensive but I would be surprised if the EPA
<br>
was not requiring this now.
