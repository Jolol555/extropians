<em>&gt; &gt; And BTW, the fact that some person should be removed from

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No, because the people - you have cut my text most carefully -  should be 
<br>
able to decide for themself. In case of Iraq, some external help is 
<br>
necessary, yes, but preemtive wars are obviously not the wisest way of 
<br>
&quot;help&quot; in this case. This is at least what even what the iraqi opposition 
<br>
says. Remember that you'll not kill Saddam and his loyal followers, but 
<br>
mostly the victims of his regime he'll send to the front. Remember that 
<br>
_if_ there are any garage type WMD fabrications, the chances are high 
<br>
that they'll fall into the hands of some warrior group in the region, 
<br>
before any US troops get secure them.
<br>
<p>Besides, I don't believe a bit of this &quot;we have to bring freedom and 
<br>
democracy&quot; rubbish. This will be a side effect, if it will happen at all. 
<br>
For me, this seems to be the holy war of some lunatic who spreads and 
<br>
uses fear as an instrument of terror and manipulation of the masses. 
<br>
These so called &quot;evidences&quot; wouldn't stand any trial. Yet the US regime 
<br>
thinks they are good enough to start a war that will shake the whole 
<br>
middle east.
<br>
<p>The US administration still deals with mad men and dictators all over the 
<br>
planet for profit, resources and against the current enemy of the month. 
<br>
Financial and military support for Pakistan for example, how ridiculous. 
<br>
They _do_ have nuclear missile. Their secret service, ISI, not only 
<br>
receives funding, weapons like Stinger missiles etc. and military 
<br>
informations from the CIA, but also have good and personal relations to 
<br>
the Taliban in Afghanistan. And last year, we almost had a war between 
<br>
Pakistan and India. Or take North Korea. They _have_ WMDs and they have a 
<br>
critical conflict with the South. They are desperate enough to threaten 
<br>
the complete UN. And what do Mr. and Mrs. Hardliner from White House and 
<br>
Pentagon say? Okay, we'll deal with it fully diplomatically.
<br>
<p>One could get the impression that the US administration is more carefull 
<br>
and diplomatic, the more WMDs a country has. Maybe they've made sure that 
<br>
Saddam really has no WMDs and therefore it's safe enough to invade Iraq 
<br>
:-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If that would be the case, Mr. Bush should be very, very careful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why? With a &quot;right&quot; and 50 cents you could buy yourself a Coke. You'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need more than a &quot;right&quot; to remove Mr. Bush from power with military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force, you'd need , well, military force.
</em><br>
<p>You're right. A passenger ticket for a 747 is a little bit more 
<br>
expensive. But I heard dance hall's and subways are cheap these days - 
<br>
and I think, with some small hand gun, one could free rides on a gasoline 
<br>
ship, next time full speed into the harbor, yahooo! You think a war 
<br>
against Iraq will make the world a safer place? Ha! It will turn Iraq 
<br>
into a bazaar for weapons. And guess against whom these weapons wil be 
<br>
used.
