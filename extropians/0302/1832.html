<p>Very sad indeed. But this has spooked me out because of the following.
<br>
<p>Here is a question for those of you with better maths than me.
<br>
Between about 2:50 gmt and 3:05 today I was locked out of my house and 
<br>
standing on my front step. I noticed in the western sky at about 5 degrees or 
<br>
so from the horizon, there was what looked like a wide,short con trail 
<br>
pointing virtually straight down and slightly left. It kind of resembled the 
<br>
shape of a comet trail but was very short and sqaut. The length was only 
<br>
about 5 time the width with a blunt pointed bottom and a more pointed top. It 
<br>
was slightly brighter than the clouds.
<br>
It didnt move like the clouds so I could see that if was a long way off and 
<br>
at high altitude. It did move slightly to the left over a period of 10 mins 
<br>
while I watched it.  My initial thought was that it was a meteor trail or a 
<br>
near earth brush through the upper atmosphere. After watching it I concluded 
<br>
it must simple be a very strange cloud.
<br>
Now having just seen the news and read the posts about the shuttle, I'm 
<br>
thinking maybe that is what I saw. But here is the stumper, I'm in the UK! 
<br>
<p>So here is the maths problem. Could I have seen the break up of the shuttle 
<br>
of 3000 mile away? bearing in mind the altitude, angle of the sun reflecting 
<br>
of the break up trail and the curvature of the earth. Could it be due to a 
<br>
Morgana type mirage magnifying and curving the light from below the horizon? 
<br>
<p>I'll find out my exact position in Long,Lat the compass heading I was facing 
<br>
and a more accurate measurement of the angle if it helps.
<br>
<p>If the maths say it not posible then, what a weird coincidence.
<br>
<p>Alex
