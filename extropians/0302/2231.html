<p>Matilda's waltz ends
<br>
<p>February 7 2003
<br>
<p><p>Australia's first cloned sheep, Matilda, died unexpectedly of unknown
<br>
causes, the South Australian Research Institute (SARDI) announced today.
<br>
<p>Executive Director Rob Lewis said an independent autopsy failed to identify
<br>
what killed Matilda, who died at the Turretfield Research Centre, north of
<br>
Adelaide, on the weekend.
<br>
<p>Her body was found by staff on Sunday morning.
<br>
<p>&quot;On Saturday, when she was last inspected, she was remarkably healthy,&quot; Mr
<br>
Lewis told AAP today.
<br>
<p>&quot;The animal has been particularly sprightly and her death was very
<br>
unexpected.&quot;
<br>
<p>He said ongoing observations of Matilda since she was born in April 2000
<br>
showed she was a healthy animal.
<br>
<p>Scientists cloned Matilda using a technique similar to that used for the
<br>
world's first cloned sheep, Dolly, in Scotland in 1996.
<br>
<p>Matilda, at the age of nine months, gave birth to healthy triplets using a
<br>
speed-breeding technique.
<br>
<p>That was more than a year younger than most sheep, and her offspring have
<br>
gone on to successfully reproduce. [etc]
