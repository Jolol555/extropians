</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So say you're in democratic nation A with a general
<br>
freedom of speech expression, good civil rights, a
<br>
generally wholesome nation.  A large corporate
<br>
conglomerate finds profit in the selling of abandoned
<br>
infants to a less developed nation to be groomed into
<br>
slaves.  The government which is an inobtrusive
<br>
bureaucracy-choked morass has done in both public
<br>
opinion and statistically better than any previous
<br>
administration as far as increasing the economy, the
<br>
standard of living for citizens, etc.  They however
<br>
are denying this issue of baby selling, perhaps have
<br>
brought litigation against a few lesser villians or a
<br>
slap on the wrist of the corporation.  The next vote
<br>
is a couple of years off, and the chance of the
<br>
current administration being ousted is near nill, plus
<br>
the opposing party is fairly indifferent on the issue,
<br>
as the guilty corporation is a huge financial revenue
<br>
for both.
<br>
<p>Yourself and a significant portion of the population
<br>
are outraged that this is going on in a supposed free
<br>
country, and want to let it be known that this is
<br>
intolerable.  How do you effectively strike out
<br>
against this?
<br>
<p>If you want a more viable dilemna, imagine, just for a
<br>
second, that your information had shown that this war
<br>
really was a facade, in ways further than the biggest
<br>
peaceniks in reality are claiming.  Many people agree
<br>
with you on this, but a rising religious undertone is
<br>
showing blind support to government which is spreading
<br>
(effectively) propaganda, and they're actually moving
<br>
in on arresting people who definetely aren't
<br>
terrorists under guises of protecting freedom, holding
<br>
them without due process.  Lets beef the numbers up to
<br>
about 5-10 thousand people which could happen without
<br>
violence taking to the streets I suppose.  You believe
<br>
that the majority of the citizens agree that the war
<br>
is wrong, and the polls from sources you trust agree
<br>
with this information.  It's clear that with a
<br>
successful war, any chance at truth would be lost to
<br>
the victors, and the administration will be re-elected
<br>
now without feeling need to show any restraint in
<br>
their extremism since they have the populace in a
<br>
chokehold.
<br>
<p>Now of course protests in reality often fall far short
<br>
of any reasonable claims (animal rights activists
<br>
storming Wendy's), but you claim it's about as
<br>
uncooperative a thing as you can do in a democratic
<br>
country.  If this is universally true, then how would
<br>
you respond in this situation?
<br>
<p><p>If you find inconsistency within the plausibility of
<br>
the situation, feel free to adjust the analogy
<br>
accordingly.
