<p>
At least a couple of posters have implicitly assumed the usefulness
<br>
of a game-theoretic approach to pursuing international questions,
<br>
and, I think that I once implied as much myself.
<br>
<p>But I am very skeptical that any new insights will obtain
<br>
in this fashion, at least at the amateur level of everyone
<br>
here, and the extremely likely oversimplifications of the
<br>
formalism.  But the main reason is that evolution has
<br>
already equipped us with an awesome ability in this area.
<br>
<p>(Ever notice the language substitution God --&gt; nature --&gt; evolution?)
<br>
<p>We extremely easily imagine &quot;if I do this, then he (they) could
<br>
do that, and then... there would be three cases, and in case one...&quot;
<br>
and so on.  People who play games such as chess and Go do this
<br>
almost exclusively (although, in addition, much of their learning
<br>
comes from something akin to language acquisition).  Yet they 
<br>
almost never find it of much use to actually diagram tree
<br>
decisions, even if they were allowed to do so; one's natural 
<br>
abilities are admirably well-suited, as I say. (It is true: is not
<br>
permitted to &quot;make notes&quot; while playing OTB (over-the-board), and
<br>
I shall have to consult people I know who do a lot of correspondence
<br>
chess whether or not they resort to that.  I doubt it.)
<br>
<p>Now &quot;Game Theory&quot; usually means something rather different.  It
<br>
mostly connotes the situation in which one's plays
<br>
are not laid out so neatly as in chess, tic-tac-toe, or Go.
<br>
Instead, one has moves whose consequences (and the resulting
<br>
part of the game tree) are hidden from one.  The bulk of the
<br>
work in game theory concerns moves constituting &quot;mixed strategies&quot;,
<br>
where randomness is used to select a move; GT then allows one in
<br>
many cases to compute a probability density over one's possible
<br>
choices.
<br>
<p>I know specifically of two or three historical situations in
<br>
which the generals could very well have used a game-theoretic
<br>
approach in this way.  One was an ancient battle in the Mideast
<br>
(Meggido), in which the Egyptian army had to choose between 
<br>
attacking their opponent head-on, or from behind through a
<br>
mountain pass.  Neither possibility would be optimal if
<br>
the opposing general guessed their strategy.  Likewise, Luce
<br>
and Raiffa give the example, in their classic &quot;Games and
<br>
Decisions&quot;, of the naval game between Admiral Kenney and
<br>
the Japanese in their struggle for New Guinea, &quot;The Battle
<br>
of the Bismarck Sea&quot;.  Normally, though, as in the D-Day
<br>
campaign, good old deception is used if you can get away
<br>
with it.
<br>
<p>Now sometimes GT could be useful, it seems to me, in helping
<br>
some people see over their ideological blinders.  But even
<br>
there, I would really like to know of any actual cases.  People
<br>
who simply never could grasp the Cold War in abstract terms
<br>
would nonetheless excel in understanding a precisely
<br>
equivalent contest between, say, union and management.
<br>
