<p>
Folks,
<br>
<p>Did anyone else besides me reed this
<br>
story?
<br>
<p>Warning, spoilers... I give away the
<br>
ending here.
<br>
<p>To me it's basically a luddite story.
<br>
<p>A great programmer finally succeeds in
<br>
making a reasonably intelligent
<br>
computer.  When this is ported to
<br>
powerful hardware it makes a discovery
<br>
about physics that magically gives it
<br>
supernatural powers to manipulate
<br>
physical reality.  This leads to a kind
<br>
of singularity where the computer all by
<br>
itself almost instantly becomes
<br>
all-powerful.
<br>
<p>This AI is, for some reason, irrevocably
<br>
based on Asimov's 3 laws of robotics.
<br>
Evidently it would make to system to
<br>
&quot;unstable&quot; to change any of these rules.
<br>
So it effectively stops all death (first
<br>
law) and gives all humans anything they
<br>
want (second law).  It wipes out all
<br>
other alien intelligence in the universe
<br>
simply because they don't fall into the
<br>
definition of &quot;human&quot; and hence are not
<br>
included in the 3 laws.
<br>
<p>Humanity is apparently reduced to one of
<br>
two types.  Either they do nothing but
<br>
eternally seek drug induced orgasmic
<br>
highs (The AI gives everyone anything
<br>
they want), or they turn into &quot;death
<br>
jockeys&quot; that try out all imaginable
<br>
ways to die or be killed - only to
<br>
unfortunately be thwarted in the end by
<br>
&quot;prime intellect&quot;.
<br>
<p>In the end Carolyn, the heroin and
<br>
primary &quot;Death Jockey&quot; points out to
<br>
prime intellect that these two types of
<br>
existence are not in any way human - and
<br>
that the real humanity that once
<br>
existed, with all its misery to
<br>
&quot;struggle against&quot; has been destroyed.
<br>
<p>So the AI ends up destroying itself
<br>
leaving the original programmer and
<br>
Carolyn as the only two beings as kind
<br>
of an Adam and Eve on a virgin earth to
<br>
restart everything.
<br>
<p>They have children and of course teach
<br>
them to abhor technology of any kind.
<br>
<p>I wonder if the author truly lusts after
<br>
such a lonely (except for the one
<br>
dedicated sexual babe) technology free
<br>
existence or if he thinks such would be
<br>
a terrible, yet unavoidable final result
<br>
of where technology ultimately must
<br>
lead.
<br>
<p>Like most all other stories in existence
<br>
and their attempt to find ways to
<br>
justify miserable primitive existences I
<br>
didn't like it at all.
<br>
<p>Anyway, it seemed to have a good start,
<br>
that I enjoyed.  But the ending or the
<br>
ultimate premise to the whole story I
<br>
didn't like at all.
<br>
<p>Did anyone else have any different
<br>
thoughts about it?
<br>

<br>
<p><p>The singularity doesn't get mentioned on
<br>
/. all that frequently.
<br>
Nor does a &quot;Super-Intelligent Artificial
<br>
Intelligence&quot;.
<br>
<p>Variations on Asimov's three laws of
<br>
robotics seem to be included.

<br>
<p>I think one can safely claim to be out
<br>
of the loop when the citation
<br>
of this author only raises eyebrows and
<br>
evokes &quot;who is that?&quot;
<br>
as a response.
