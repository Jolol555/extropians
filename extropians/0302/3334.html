<p>
The danger with E-weaponry is IMHO twofold: first, the resistance to
<br>
using it is much less than anti-human weaponry. Even current nonlethal
<br>
weapons have a chance of killing people and is seen as real force;
<br>
frying electronics is much less morally troublesome. This means that 
<br>
many would be far more willing to use it pre-emptively, and that can 
<br>
easily trigger classical force counter reaction. 
<br>
<p>Second, it seems it has a much greater potential impact on 
<br>
technologically advanced societies (and especially civil societies) than 
<br>
underdeveloped societies. The cost to Iraq of an e-bomb over Baghdad
<br>
(measured compared to the GNP) is likely far lower than the cost of 
<br>
an e-bomb over London or Washington. There are so much electronics 
<br>
around that the disruption would be profound. Just imagine metropolitan 
<br>
traffic where nearly every car might have occasional electronics 
<br>
glitches, not to mention the reliance of electronics for infrastructure, 
<br>
commerce and everyday activities. That there are backups and that truly 
<br>
important systems are hardened doesn't help when everything else is 
<br>
erratic or broken; just the re-investments to replace computers, phones, 
<br>
inkjet cartridges and hospital equipment are going to be ruinous. 
<br>
<p>This suggests that e-weaponry makes a great terror or guerilla weapon. 
<br>
If you use it, the denouncements from the world community will be far 
<br>
weaker (hey, nobody was hurt!) and even more squeamish would-be 
<br>
terrorists/freedom fighters would be ready to use it. At the same time 
<br>
it is a great way of evening the odds against a high-tech adversary, 
<br>
especially if you can get it into his population or finance centers. 
<br>
<p>From a transhumanist point it is even worse, since such weapons strike 
<br>
against the infrastructure we want to use to bootstrap ourselves (unless 
<br>
one is rigorously pro-biotech and mental training). They might even be 
<br>
the sabotage tool of choice for truly violent luddites. At the same time 
<br>
proliferation of e-weaponry (which seems likely) might lead to a heavier 
<br>
emphasis on distributed robust systems after a few nasty cases have 
<br>
occured and everybody else is scrambling to avoid being fried. Maybe a 
<br>
proper transhumanist approach would be to premptively find ways of 
<br>
distributing one's informational and electronic exoself in such a way 
<br>
that the occasional e-bomb (or fire, burglarly or computer intrusion) 
<br>
doesn't sting that much.
