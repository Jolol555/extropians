<p>A very insightful observation and apropos to this point in history when some
<br>
of our greatest danger comes from our own reactions to fear.
<br>
<p>I think this tendency to compete with &quot;outsiders&quot; is mainly a result of our
<br>
evolved nature and applies generally to all of us humans.  These differences
<br>
between cultures arise from the values we apply to channeling or tempering
<br>
this tendency to achieve our goals.
<br>
<p>I also realize I don't fully grok the concept.  For example, I have been
<br>
perplexed for years trying to understand how so many people adopt an
<br>
arbitrary choice of sports team and behave as if &quot;their&quot; team winning is
<br>
nearly a life and death matter.
