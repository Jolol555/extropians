2004 presented by President George W. Bush provides $847 million for the

nanomachines. When it comes to nanotechnology, many researchers turn to
<br>
nature for inspiration. Of particular interest to nanoengineers is the

naturally occurring protein kinesin. If kinesin-like nanodevices are to
<br>
become reality, researchers first need to solve a fundamental mystery about
<br>
how kinesin moves. A new laser microscope designed at Stanford University is
<br>
providing new clues. (Stanford University news 2/25/03)

become a &quot;natural bandage.&quot; Spun from strands of fibrinogen 1,000 times
