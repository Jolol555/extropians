<em>&gt; &gt;Yes I doubt it, as far as Iraq and Saddam are concerned. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;currently has nothing to win a war with.  Every open aggression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would immediately bring up the coalition of 90/91 again.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;therefore much wiser for him to play dead and innocent as he does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If there's one thing he's an expert in, it is to keep his position,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;even if an international arm invades his country.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;(I'd still like to know why the last US-invasion was stopped so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;soon. Can anybody enlighten me on this?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this was because it wasn't a US invasion, or at least no a US only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invasion.  The UN mandate we had said that we could liberate Kuwait, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't say anything about invading Iraq.
</em><br>
<p>This is also what I've heard:  there had been a specific agreement
<br>
with many countries *not* to depose Saddam nor to conquer Iraq.
<br>
So when the Iraqi army was in full retreat, the U.S. and its allies
<br>
reluctantly had to decide between breaking their word, or suspending
<br>
the conquest.
<br>
<p>Anyone know better?
<br>
