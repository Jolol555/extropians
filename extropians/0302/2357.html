<p><em>&gt; I just calculated that my 1988 Honda Integra with a somewhat hotted up 1.6

delivers

<p>Maybe they can do better, but I'm not finding cars better than my 1989 Geo 
<br>
Metro available.  I love that car.  50 mpg on the highway now (and used to 
<br>
get 58 mpg when younger).  Sigh.  I also have a 1999 VW New Beetle and it's 
<br>
getting about 35 mpg highway. Plus the visiblity is horrid.  Does feel nice 
<br>
on the highway, though.  Handles nicely and feels solid. :)
<br>
<p>Yes, I am disappointed about the gas mileage.

<p><p>I've wondered that too.  I always thought defensive driving was *my*

responsibility, so I didn't worry overly much about the size of my car.  As 
<br>
long as we could fit all our gear in we were ok.  Of course if you're 
<br>
dragging 6 kids with full hockey gear everywhere, that's gonna take some 
<br>
larger vehicle - especially given that each kid *must* have certain child 
<br>
restraints, etc. Required by law here.
<br>
<p>When we had our first child all we had was an ancient Porsche 356 and the kid 
<br>
slept in a basket in the &quot;back&quot; - behind our seats.  But nowadays that would 
<br>
not be allowed, IIUC.  In the US, that is.

<p>Oh, come on - in the Geo one would fit between the rear seat and the &quot;back 
<br>
back&quot;!  :)  You know, like those &quot;fences&quot; people put in cars to contain dogs!

<p>Ha!  Bigger on the inside than on the outside, even.  :)  And the earlier 
<br>
ones had greater gas mileage than yours.  The reason I didn't buy another was 
<br>
(mostly) that change - for the worse IMHO.  I love my Geo, still have it (at 
<br>
140 000 miles), it runs like a top, but it is old enough now that I begin to 
<br>
wonder if it will suddenly disintegrate on me when I'm taking a long road 
<br>
trip.  So I bought the VW New Beetle.

<p>Have always heard that car dealers do not like selling little cars, not much 
<br>
profit there.  No doubt the manufacturers feel similarly.
