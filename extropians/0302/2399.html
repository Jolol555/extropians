<p>Good. Me too. 
<br>
<p>However I don't agree with your assertion that *all* experts agree that
<br>
selegiline is not neuroprotective in PD. On the contrary I know that
<br>
some do not accept your view despite the results of the one DATATOP
<br>
study that you and your associates are relying on so heavily to support
<br>
your opposite stance. 
<br>
<p>Old ideas die hard, and often for good reason. In this case the reason
<br>
is that there is still much evidence to suggest that the DATATOP results
<br>
may have been a statistical aberration in this one respect. 
<br>
<p>The situation is similar right now in female hormone replacement therapy
<br>
(HRT). Recently a large well-controlled study, one that could be
<br>
considered as reliable as DATATOP, was halted due to initial evidence
<br>
that the risks/benefits ratio of HRT is unacceptable. The study was
<br>
halted even while other evidence and a lot of very good scientific
<br>
theory suggests the opposite should be true. Gerontologists are now
<br>
divided over the subject. In fact in Britain I believe they practically
<br>
scoffed at the fact that we Americans halted the trial before it was
<br>
over; the Brits have therefore initiated a similar trial of their own.
<br>
Good for them, I say! 
<br>
<p>My point here is that DATATOP should not be considered the &quot;last word on
<br>
the subject&quot; of selegiline in PD, as you have suggested it should be.
<br>
There are simply too many good theoretical and empirical reasons to
<br>
think selegiline is neuroprotective in or out of PD, even despite the
<br>
statistics of DATATOP. Statistics are, after all, statistics. There is
<br>
always room for error.
<br>
<p>The preponderance of the evidence outside of DATATOP very clearly
<br>
supports my view that selegiline is neuroprotective, *in general*, and
<br>
in fact even the DATATOP evidence only barely suggests that it isn't
<br>
even in PD! 
<br>
<p>The DATATOP data very strongly supports my view that selegiline delays
<br>
the onset of PD symptoms, and there is only a philosophical difference
<br>
between the delay of a disease's symptoms and a delay of the onset of
<br>
the disease itself. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The conflicting evidence in PD suggests however that there may be
<br>
something peculiar about Parkinson's Disease that would mitigate
<br>
selegiline's neuroprotective effects in PD. It is to *this* and only
<br>
*this* that you and I are in agreement. (But hey, agreement is still a
<br>
good thing! :)
<br>
<p>Because this discussion list is not a support list for Parkinson's
<br>
Disease patients, I suggest we stop focusing only on PD and start
<br>
focusing on the likely risks/benefits of selegiline in healthy and aging
<br>
people.
