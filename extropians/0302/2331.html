Spike66 noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;The figure of merit is not deaths per 100K population, but
<br>
rather fatalities per km driven.  The U.S. is a big country
<br>
and proles need need to drive far into the city in order to
<br>
get a high enough paying job afford the payments on that
<br>
home far from the city.
<br>
Those nations such as Italy and Babylon, that were invented
<br>
before there were cars, are set up differently.  Ive seen
<br>
pictures of them, its truly amazing.  There are *homes* right
<br>
down *in* the city with all the businesses and stuff.  They
<br>
needn't drive far.  What a concept!
<br>
People in Sweden drive more carefully because there is
<br>
ice on the road I suppose.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>There's an article in the most recent Economist -
<br>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1563761">http://economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1563761</a>&quot;&gt;<a href="http://economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1563761</A">http://economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1563761</A</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>- which focuses on the difference in lifestyles and standards of living 
<br>
between North America and Europe. This is worth a peeky-see, as a side-bar 
<br>
issue. On Fuel Efficient Cars  (main thread) Unless we start manufacturing 
<br>
vehicles that are light-weight but even safer than we currently make, the 
<br>
market will always be small. Why? People are well-aware of crumple zones, and 
<br>
insurance companies have methods of analyzing safety. So if engineers have 
<br>
come up with a light weight steel alloy fabrication, that saves fuel useage, 
<br>
while providing something &quot;less tinny&quot; in the way of protection; we can then 
<br>
have our tofu and eat it, so to speak.
<br>
<p>Why purchase a &quot;death trap&quot;  (Yugo-clone) when you can ride in comfort with 
<br>
an SUV? Now affordability is another matter, but again, if Tokyo or Detroit 
<br>
makes car frames and doors out of tougher materials, better designs, its an 
<br>
advantage that benefits the consumer.
