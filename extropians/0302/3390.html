</em><br>
<p>Although I am aware that the US has declined to sign up to certain
<br>
treaties (such as on the environment - Kyoto and on an international
<br>
court that could try American's for  war crimes) this is quite a
<br>
separate matter to the US being in clear and unambiguous breach of 
<br>
a treaty. It is also quite a separate matter to the US dealing with 
<br>
dictators and warlord in those parts of the world where neither they
<br>
nor anyone else seems to have effective jurisdiction. 
<br>
<p>My reading of Article 51 of the UN Charter suggests that the US
<br>
did not need to breach the UN Charter to go after the Taliban into
<br>
Afghanistan but that they do need a new resolution to go into 
<br>
Iraq now that the Security Council has their signature on 1441 and
<br>
Chirac could exercise a veto..
<br>
<p>I don't know of any clear unambiguous cases of the US breaching
<br>
a treaty recently lets say post Viet Nam for instance (if then). But
<br>
this could easily be my ignorance. 
<br>
<p>Can anyone give a *clear* and *unambiguous* instance of a treaty
<br>
breach by the US? I mean a material or significant breach of the 
<br>
sort an impartial and reasonable third party would recognize? 
<br>
