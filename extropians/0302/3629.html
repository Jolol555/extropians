</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fewer risks than ever before---is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; caused by people not having enough ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things to worry about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We all know a lot of people like this -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's pretty normal, I think. And I agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with you that we have less to worry about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than ever before.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, so we have to focus on what has
<br>
changed in the last decade or so (as
<br>
you also specified).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; To some extent I have been guilty of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [those] examples you posit... for another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; example, I began wearing my seat belt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Who can really say with any authority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which risks are worth taking and which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey, I wear my seat belt too. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convenient and seems to make a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference to something which,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistically speaking, is damned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous, which is being in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motor vehicle.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but observe carefully:   We didn't
<br>
use to do this!   Until twenty or thirty
<br>
years ago---exactly the time frame you
<br>
have specified---people were quite non-
<br>
chalant about seat belts.  We worry about
<br>
*many* things that we didn't used to.
<br>
<p>Children in most states in the U.S. are
<br>
now required to wear helmets even for
<br>
bicycle riding!  And everyone must stand
<br>
in line and undergo the most ridiculous
<br>
searches in order to board an airline!
<br>
The common explanation to this is that
<br>
quite rare incidents evoke in us vastly
<br>
more fear than they used to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Statistically speaking, you and I are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so extraordinarily unlikely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmed by a &quot;terrorist&quot; that it makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no sense to devote any personal resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the task of thwarting them, [Yes!]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and certainly it makes no sense to let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal freedoms be impinged on to that end.
</em><br>
<p>While you are perfectly correct about an
<br>
individual, in the light of the odds against
<br>
harm coming to him or her, I think that you
<br>
are wrong about a threat to a nation.  The
<br>
people of any nation---and NOT in just the
<br>
last ten years---react very powerfully to
<br>
threats against their country.  Here are
<br>
the reasons:
<br>
<p>(1) They have a nationalistic spirit (patriotism)
<br>
(2) A big component of a threat is the unknown.
<br>
<p>I know that many, including you, have no use
<br>
for number (1), and we have discussed why
<br>
patriotism exists, and have speculated on
<br>
its future necessity, and so forth.
<br>
<p>But let me illustrate (2) with what I hope will
<br>
be an amusing example.  A new office mate has
<br>
just moved into your cubical which you and he
<br>
share, and he seems to be a diligent and 
<br>
satisfactory coworker except for one minor
<br>
trait.  Every twenty minutes or so, when your
<br>
back is turned, he zings you in the ear with
<br>
a rubber band.  Now it so happens that the
<br>
actual pain of this does not compare to your
<br>
headache which goes on hour after hour, and
<br>
the little zing poses absolutely no threat to
<br>
your health.
<br>
<p>So why do you obsess over it?  One reason is
<br>
that anyone crazy enough to do that might be
<br>
capable of anything.  This is why the U.S.,
<br>
for example, gets so worked up over a few
<br>
thousand people at Pearl Harbor or the World
<br>
Trade Center, when traffic accidents take
<br>
vastly more people away and constitute a
<br>
much greater statistical hazard.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Rationally, if we were to go after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safety, we'd probably look a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more at heart disease, cancer and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; car accidents.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  But it would be &quot;hyper-rational&quot;,
<br>
not rational, to react to the potential
<br>
for attacks against heavily populated cities
<br>
with less concern than something like traffic
<br>
or cancer that does not have this great
<br>
*unknown* element in it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think people get fixated on scary things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (like terrorists, or meningococcal, or meteor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strikes), mostly to feed the need for worry.
</em><br>
<p>Yes --- if they do so out of *personal* concern.
<br>
Or, as I suggested earlier, out of a sort of
<br>
innumeracy (they have no real understanding of
<br>
the probabilities involved, or can't emotionally
<br>
internalize that information).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find ... that many people I talk to are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more fearful now than they were in the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (say early nineties, after the fall of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Berlin wall, for a baseline).
</em><br>
<p>Ah, this is important.  The recent posts from
<br>
many have convinced me that this must be
<br>
a real phenomenon.  And you *are* talking 
<br>
about *personal* fear, not nationalistic
<br>
anger at insult.  You probably recall the
<br>
posts by estropico sent on Tue 2/18/2003
<br>
at 8:03 AM called &quot;Marching for Risk Avoidance&quot;
<br>
where it was suggested that a component of
<br>
the peace marches was a fear that something
<br>
might change.  So far I don't see any common
<br>
denominator, except, as I said, that people
<br>
have it so good, and so have a lot of free
<br>
time and energy to worry about things of no
<br>
impact on their own lives.
