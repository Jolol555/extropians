<p>### This is correct. The extreme technical difficulty of building a cheap,
<br>
practical and efficient replacement for the internal combustion engine is
<br>
indeed a major problem. However, this is not directly related to the issue
<br>
of economical rationality of commodity taxes.

<p><p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; I'd set on (a) first, and on developing (b) and (c), which would
</em><br>

</em><br>

### I am sure there are thousands of capable engineers with hundreds of
<br>
millions of dollars in research money, working on improving automotive
<br>
efficiency, but so far they were largely unsuccessful. I hope that
<br>
eventually we will have more efficient cars at reasonable prices, and I will
<br>
be happy to buy one of them.
