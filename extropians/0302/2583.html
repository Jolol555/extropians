<em>&gt; &gt; I find it interesting that probabilities must work differently for these
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computer printout which is supposed to be the millionth bit in the binary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expansion of pi. However the computer is somewhat faulty and in 1% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; branches of the multiverse it gives an incorrect answer. Now you're asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to guess the true value of the millionth bit of pi (let's call this X). If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you guess correctly you'll be rewarded, otherwise punished, with about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equal severity. Suppose you see the number 0 on your printout, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you don't have any other information about what X is, and you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; compute it in your head. Obviously both the egoist-temporalist and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; altruist-Platonist would choose to guess 0, but their reasoning process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be different.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Before seeing the printout, both types believe that the probability of X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being 0 is .5. After seeing the printout, the egoist-temporalist would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apply Bayes's rule and think that the probability of X being 0 is .99.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He reasons that guessing 0 lead to a .99 probability of reward and .01
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probability of punishment. His expected utility of choosing 0 is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; .99*U(reward) + .01*U(punishment).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; An altruist-Platonist would instead continue to believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probability of X being 0 is .5.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, on the grounds that there is no longer any basis for the .5
<br>
estimate.  I don't believe that in any of the Tegmark universes pi
<br>
can assume any other value than it does.  Therefore, the altruist-
<br>
Platonist would believe that p(X=0) is .99.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Note that if he did apply Bayes's rule, then his expected utility would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; instead become .99*U(.99m people rewarded) + .01*U(.01m people punished)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which would weight the reward too heavily. It doesn't matter in this case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but would matter in other situations.
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean, &quot;it doesn't matter in this case&quot;?  On one reading
<br>
of that I must ask for you to supply a case, if possible, where it
<br>
does matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If he chooses to apply Bayes's rule, then his expected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *global* utility [of choosing 0] is p(1)*u(.99m rewarded)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; + p(1)*u(.01m punished),
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  And that (as you write later) is merely
<br>
<p>p(1) * (the event that .99 of 'em get zapped and .01 of 'em get blissed)
<br>
<p>which is not at all surprising.  And is it not the same as Wei Dai
<br>
had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; .99*U(reward) + .01*U(punishment).
</em><br>
<p>in easier-to-understand language?
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Roughly speaking, if a Bayesian altruist-Platonist sees X=0, his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected global utility is:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; p(.99)*u(.99m observers see 0 =&gt; .99m observers choose 0 =&gt; .99m observers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are rewarded &amp;&amp; .01m observers see 1 =&gt; .01m observers choose 1 =&gt; .01m 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observers are punished)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; +
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(.01)*u(.99m observers see 1 =&gt; .99m observers choose 1 =&gt; .99m observers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are rewarded &amp;&amp; .01m observers see 0 =&gt; .01m observers choose 0 =&gt; .01m 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observers are punished)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; =
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(1)*u(.99m observers are rewarded &amp;&amp; .01m observers are punished)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; =
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(1)*u(.99m observers rewarded) + p(1)*u(.01m observers are punished)
