<em>&gt; &gt; We're still propping up corrupt dictators.
</em><br>
<p>Actually that was me (mez) who wrote that we'll still propping up
<br>
corrupt dictators.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Prime Minister of Australia??
</em><br>
<p>Here are two examples:  
<br>
<p>1) Hosni Mubarak, the so-called &quot;president&quot; of Egypt, is a dictator.
<br>
There are no free elections in Egypt.  He's stolen at least hundreds
<br>
of millions of dollars from the country.  He does not allow a free
<br>
press.  He's grooming his son Gamal to replace him.  The US gives his
<br>
government $3B a year in direct aid.  
<br>
<p>2) Pervez Musharaf, the so called &quot;president&quot; of Pakistan, is a
<br>
dictators.  He's a general who overthrew a democratically elected
<br>
government.  He uses torture and summary imprisonment and execution to
<br>
have his way in his country.  We were opposed to his rule until 9/11.
<br>
Then we found him useful because his country borders on Afghanistan.
<br>
At that point all our principled objections to a military coup went
<br>
away.  We dropped the military sanctions we'd put in place and
<br>
promised billions on loan guarantees and aid.
<br>
<p>One thing these two dictators have in common is that they oppress the
<br>
devout Muslim populations of their country.  The Shah did the same
<br>
thing in Iran, and look how that turned out.
