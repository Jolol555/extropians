Hubert Humania asked:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;A German expert on Iraq has published a book with the title &quot;Who will be
<br>
crying for Abdul and Tanyana&quot; trying to direct the attention on the misery
<br>
of the civil deaths in Iraq. Think about dead women and children too, when
<br>
you will be proud to have conquered the oil wells with your American marine
<br>
friends
<br>
Hubert&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Your &quot;Iraq Expert&quot; doesn't seem to ask, Who weeps for them now? Its not as if 
<br>
brutality or murder doesn't currently exist in today's Iraq. Who will weep 
<br>
for American children once Saddam or Uday can deliver bio-warfare to Boston 
<br>
harbor? Your presumption is that &quot;doing nothing&quot; will assure safety. Your 
<br>
second presumption is that your EU junior partner, France, is not doing 
<br>
things in the world, strictly for petrol too, namely, its entire middle east 
<br>
policy. Your third presumption is that the Jihadi Muslims movement will not 
<br>
attack you first, even if you side with them. The French situation in the 
<br>
middle east, with its oil tankers, and the Paris bombing campaign of 1999 by 
<br>
Muslim militants suggests otherwise.
<br>
<p>Can the Iraqi expert you cite, come up with some real-world examples for not 
<br>
invading Iraq? Depriving the Islamic militants of a victory, might dissuade 
<br>
them from further 9-11 attacks; and weakness seems merely to spawn more 
<br>
contempt and aggression from them.
