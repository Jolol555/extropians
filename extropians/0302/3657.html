<p>House Votes to Ban All Human Cloning
<br>
<p>By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG
<br>
<p>ASHINGTON, Feb. 27 - Warning that human cloning amounted to a dark
<br>
and dangerous step into an unethical realm of science, the House of
<br>
Representatives voted today to ban all human-cloning experiments,
<br>
whether for baby-making or to create cells that might be used to
<br>
treat disease.
<br>
<p>The bill, adopted by a vote of 241 to 155, is nearly identical to
<br>
one that passed the House in July 2001. It has the strong support of
<br>
President Bush but an uncertain future in the Senate.
<br>
<p>The measure would make any attempt to clone a human embryo a crime,
<br>
punishable by a $1 million fine and up to 10 years in prison, and
<br>
would also bar the importing of medical therapies derived from
<br>
cloning.
<br>
<p>The bill's margin of victory was similar to that of the 2001
<br>
legislation, suggesting that members' positions had changed little.
<br>
Passage followed the defeat of a less restrictive alternative that
<br>
would have banned reproductive cloning but allowed cloning for
<br>
research. The vote against that version was 231 to 174, with one
<br>
member voting present.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm certainly gratified to see the House continuing to support
<br>
banning all forms of human cloning,&quot; the chief sponsor of the ban,
<br>
Representative Dave Weldon, Republican of Florida, said as the final
<br>
vote was drawing to a close. Referring to the Senate, he said,
<br>
&quot;Hopefully it will pass, and the president will be able to sign it
<br>
into law.&quot;
<br>
<p>But the measure's fate in the Senate is unclear. There is nearly
<br>
universal agreement in Congress that reproductive cloning - the
<br>
making of babies that are, in essence, genetic replicas of adults -
<br>
is both immoral and unsafe, and should be banned. But there is sharp
<br>
disagreement about whether scientists should be permitted to clone
<br>
embryos to generate cells that could be used to study or treat a
<br>
range of diseases.
<br>
<p>The Senate is divided on that question, and it was on that question
<br>
that today's debate in the House turned. Arguing that little would
<br>
be lost by prohibiting the research, Dr. Weldon, a physician, held
<br>
up a white loose-leaf binder on the House floor, saying he had
<br>
reviewed 88 medical studies and could not find a single one showing
<br>
cloning's potential.
<br>
<p>&quot;We're talking about scientists' creating human embryos for the
<br>
purpose of exploiting them and destroying them,&quot; he said. &quot;There is
<br>
no scientific evidence today that this is justifiable.&quot;
<br>
<p>But the National Academy of Sciences has concluded that cloning does
<br>
hold scientific promise, and 40 Nobel laureates have expressed
<br>
support for the work. If there is a dearth of scientific evidence,
<br>
proponents of the research say, it is only because cloning is in its
<br>
infancy, and because there is such political controversy around it
<br>
that most researchers are loath to try the experiments.
<br>
<p>&quot;Extreme conviction seems to be crowding out understanding here
<br>
today,&quot; said Representative Rush D. Holt, a New Jersey Democrat who
<br>
has a Ph.D. in physics. &quot;These researchers are not crazed Dr.
<br>
Frankensteins. They are people like your neighbors, highly ethical,
<br>
who are working hard to relieve suffering, to improve quality of
<br>
life. Let's not make them criminals.&quot;
<br>
<p>At times, the debate sounded more like a college lecture in science
<br>
and philosophy than political discourse, with House members quoting
<br>
the Bible and medical literature to make their points. At other
<br>
times, it sounded like a personal confessional, with lawmakers
<br>
disclosing illnesses in their families.
<br>
<p>At one point, Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of
<br>
Wisconsin, who as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
<br>
shepherded the bill on the floor, angrily announced that his wife
<br>
had a spinal cord injury, the kind of damage that some say could be
<br>
addressed by cloning research. Nonetheless, he said, she supports
<br>
his efforts to ban the work.
<br>
<p>&quot;There is a moral and ethical issue in this,&quot; Mr. Sensenbrenner
<br>
said, adding: &quot;Many people want to turn their backs. But in my
<br>
family we have to live with it every day and every minute, and we
<br>
will until death do us part.&quot;
<br>
<p>Others argued that it would be immoral not to allow research cloning
<br>
to proceed. Representative James C. Greenwood, the Pennsylvania
<br>
Republican who sponsored the alternative, said millions of Americans
<br>
suffering from diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's might
<br>
benefit from cloning experiments.
<br>
<p>&quot;The ethical and moral issue here,&quot; Mr. Greenwood said, &quot;is, Are we
<br>
or are we not willing to allow that science to go forward?&quot;
<br>
<p>Advocates for patients said they were disappointed by the vote,
<br>
though not surprised.
<br>
<p>&quot;The hard-line opponents of scientific and medical research turned
<br>
their backs on patients today,&quot; said Michael Manganiello, president
<br>
of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research.
<br>
<p>But Cathy Cleaver, an official with the United States Conference of
<br>
Catholic Bishops, which strongly opposes cloning for any reason,
<br>
said, &quot;Today's vote reflects America's rejection of the notion that
<br>
human life is a commodity to be created for experimentation.&quot;
