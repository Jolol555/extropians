<p>I think we should show much caution in comparing road safety statistics
<br>
between countries. Some countries are better at recording traffic deaths
<br>
and accidents. Some countries have more vehicles per 100,000 population
<br>
than others. Some countries have higher driving mileages than others.
<br>
Some have more freeways (generally regarded as safer) than country
<br>
roads. Some have more two-wheeled vehicles than others. Some have more
<br>
injury accidents, but fewer deaths. Some have better emergency medical
<br>
facilities than others.
<br>
Rumor has it that in USA 'real men' don't wear seatbelts.
<br>
In Italy every driver has to be the one in front.  And so on.
<br>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.bast.de/htdocs/fachthemen/irtad/">http://www.bast.de/htdocs/fachthemen/irtad/</a>
<br>
OECD - International Road Traffic and Accident Database, which has lots
<br>
of data, only up to year 2000 though.
<br>
<p>Their figures for 'killed per 100000 population' indicate that UK,
<br>
Holland, Norway and Sweden are well-behaved, boring drivers with around
<br>
6 to 7 deaths. Italy is nearly twice this figure at 11. France and Spain
<br>
are worse at around 14. Greece and Portugal seem to lead at 20 to 21.
<br>
The USA comes in at around 15 deaths per 100,000 population.
<br>
<p><p>This OECD summary is dated 20/12/2002 and highlights some new trends in
<br>
the accident statistics
<br>
<a href="http://www.oecd.org/EN/document/0,,EN-document-0-nodirectorate-no-12-378">http://www.oecd.org/EN/document/0,,EN-document-0-nodirectorate-no-12-378</a>

<p>(snipped)
<br>
<p>Although speeding and alcohol remain among the primary causes of
<br>
fatalities, driving under the influence of drugs appears to be an
<br>
increasingly widespread road safety problem. Recent research in Holland
<br>
highlighted the increased risks involved in driving under the combined
<br>
influence of drugs and alcohol - a problem related to prescription as
<br>
well as illegal drugs.
<br>
<p>Some countries have seen recent increases in traffic deaths among older
<br>
motorcyclists. The UK, U.S. and France, for example, have experienced a
<br>
rapid rise in the proportion of fatalities involving riders between the
<br>
ages of 25 and 64. In the U.S., the most affected group has been males
<br>
over 40 years old riding large, powerful motorcycles.
<br>
<p>Countries with relatively good road safety records, such as the U.K. and
<br>
the Netherlands tend to have tough enforcement and are more likely to
<br>
stop speeders and alcohol offenders. Seat belt use, meanwhile, continues
<br>
to increase, with more than 90% of vehicle occupants in countries such
<br>
as Germany, Australia and New Zealand wearing them. However, a number of
<br>
countries - including the United States, Austria and Hungary -- still
<br>
report average usage rates of 75%, or below. About half of road
<br>
fatalities could be avoided if everyone wore seat belts.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I was unable to find any reference to micro cars being more dangerous
<br>
than large cars. But it might be that other factors outweigh the risk of
<br>
being in a small car.
<br>
<p>But it's tough if you are over 40, drink and take drugs and drive a
<br>
large, powerful motorcycle!
