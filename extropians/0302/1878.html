<p>
I too have been feeling extremely depressed since learning of this tragedy
<br>
early this morning (on extropians). I've read every post in this thread
<br>
hoping for some kind of clarity as to precisely why it has affected me on
<br>
such a profound level.
<br>
<p>The &quot;losing seven of the best of the best&quot; angle just doesn't seem to
<br>
resonate with me that much. Although I very much sympathize with the
<br>
bereaved families, I can't say I feel a greater degree of sadness simply
<br>
because of _who_ has died, or their various pedigrees. Call me strange
<br>
(hopefully not insensitive), but I suspect that had my morning started with
<br>
the news that a van carrying seven fetching prostitutes had just been
<br>
crushed under a commuter train, I might have felt a similar pang of sadness
<br>
for the essential loss of human life. In fact, the alpha male side of me
<br>
might have felt (gulp) even *more* loss.
<br>
<p>Yet overall, this tragedy has affected me more than reading about 7 *times*
<br>
7 red lights going out under the wheels a commuter train, so what gives?
<br>
<p>Can it be that I grieve for the loss of something more personally
<br>
heartrending than the deaths of seven individuals (however bright,
<br>
promising, brave, or whatever) that I have never actually met?
<br>
<p>I recall reading somewhere that &quot;to an engineer bad press is spelled:
<br>
Hindenberg, Titanic, or perhaps Pinto&quot; Well, I'm not an engineer, but as a
<br>
technophile and transhumanist I suspect something similar might be going on
<br>
in my head.
<br>
<p>Perhaps tonight I'll dream of standing naked before my grade school class
<br>
with tears streaming down my cheeks as students taunt me with questions such
<br>
as: HOW, HOW, HOW, will you control jillions of durable, microscopic robots
<br>
that breed even faster than rabbits, if thousands of scientists, engineers,
<br>
computers, backup systems, and checks and balances can't even keep one big
<br>
stupid macro vehicle from becoming an expensive photogenic meteor?
<br>
<p>Well, goodnight to you all. I'm sincerely sorry for your loss, however you
<br>
may feel it.
<br>
<p>Russell Evermore
