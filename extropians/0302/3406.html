'In the Transactional Interpretation the state vector
<br>
is considered to be a real physical wave emitted as
<br>
an &quot;offer wave&quot; based on the preparation procedure
<br>
of the experiment. The interaction then comes to a close
<br>
through the emission of the &quot;confirmation wave&quot;
<br>
by what is usually called the collapse of the wave function.
<br>
The quantum particle, e.g. the photon, electron etc.,
<br>
is then considered to be identical with the finished transaction.
<br>
It is fundamental to that interpretation that where
<br>
the closure of the transaction takes place is
<br>
an unexplained input to the process.
<br>
In the Consistent Histories Interpretation we have
<br>
a similar situation because there the observed event
<br>
again is a fundamental input in the sense that it
<br>
determines the set of possible histories consistent
<br>
with the observation made. There is no attempt to try
<br>
to explain why a specific event happened besides
<br>
on the basis of the consistent histories which
<br>
had been constructed in order to be consistent
<br>
with the observed event.'
<br>
<p>Yes, it seems that MWI is much stronger!
<br>
<p>But somebody think that information is the key factor.

Schroedinger's wave function shows many aspects of a state of incomplete
<br>
knowledge or information (&quot;bit&quot;): (1) it is usually defined on a space of
<br>
classical configurations, (2) its generic entanglement is, therefore,
<br>
analogous to statistical correlations, and (3) it determines probabilities
<br>
of measurement outcomes. Nonetheless, quantum superpositions (such as
<br>
represented by a wave function) define individual physical states (&quot;it&quot;).
<br>
This conceptual dilemma may have its origin in the conventional operational
<br>
foundation of physical concepts, successful in classical physics, but
<br>
inappropriate in quantum theory because of the existence of mutually
<br>
exclusive operations (used for the definition of concepts). In contrast, a
<br>
hypothetical realism, based on concepts that are justified only by their
<br>
universal and consistent applicability, favors the wave function as a
<br>
description of (thus nonlocal) physical reality. The (conceptually local)
<br>
classical world then appears as an illusion, facilitated by the phenomenon
<br>
of decoherence, which is consistently explained by the very entanglement
<br>
that must dynamically arise in a universal wave function.

<p>[I prefer this one, since 1972, :-)]
<br>
<p>And - like Pontius Pilatus - somebody else at last wrote ....
<br>
<p>'The question of whether the waves are something &quot;real&quot; or a function
<br>
to describe and predict phenomena in a convenient way is a matter of
<br>
taste. I personally like to regard a probability wave, even in
<br>
3N-dimensional
<br>
space, as a real thing, certainly as more than a tool for mathematical
<br>
calculations ... Quite generally, how could we rely on probability
<br>
predictions if by this notion we do not refer to something real and
<br>
objective?' - M. Born, Dover publ., 1964, Natural Philosophy of Cause and
