Yes, I think it's funny too, and I'm glad you realized that it implies the
<br>
following comments tried to be from a post-human or other-than-human point
<br>
of view.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; The sense of self is an illusion.  Science has begun to show that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; our own sense of self, which seems to us continuous and central, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; -- important -- is actually a result of multiple asynchronous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fed-back processes.  One emergent characteristic of these processes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is what we think of as consciousness or self-awareness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand the argument, and that our bodies and minds are playing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trcks on us. Delivering senses late, and then afterrationalise. Taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions and then telling the self that it was it who did it. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this does not mean that there is no self. It only means that we are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slightly more distributed system than most people think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the well-known split brain experiments, and other recent discoveries
<br>
tell us that we are not quite who we think we are.  So how far might this
<br>
extend...?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But we do make conscious decisions every day, and rational ones at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that. Or else we and society could not exist.
</em><br>
<p>In my experience observing myself and others, much of our behavior is
<br>
unconscious, and I observe that many, if not most human decisions appear to
<br>
be based on local values, emotional drives, tradition, and rationalized as
<br>
necessary later.  Various forms of society exist with all this
<br>
other-than-rational behavior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; What even most technophiles don't realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is that this sense of self is under constant revision, with memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lost, and sometimes replaced with various degrees of inaccuracy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; emotions changing, and even &quot;processing capability&quot; changing all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; time.  The sense of self is an illusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No. Changes are part of being alive. We are running the program so to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak. If we did not change we would be in a state of death. So living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is changing.
</em><br>
<p>I think we are referring to two different things here.  I agree with you
<br>
that living implies changing.
<br>
I was saying people conventionally think of themselves as having some
<br>
essentially continuous or unchanging aspect, and suggesting that this too is
<br>
suspect and will have low value to us as we advance beyond our evolutionary
<br>
bonds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; What I find strange is that many people would generally agree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the above paragraph, but then continue to think that preservation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this illusionary &quot;self&quot; is an all-important goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have yet to proove that the self is illusionary! The theory goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against both common sense and observations.
</em><br>
<p>I say it's illusory because it's not what it appears.
<br>
<p>I am not arguing that self is not a useful concept.  I'm sure that a sense
<br>
of self has been essential to survival at the most fundamental level.  A
<br>
successful organism must distinguish between Inside and Outside in order to
<br>
fight and defend.
<br>
<p>I'm suggesting that the conventional concept of self is due for upgrading as
<br>
we move beyond evolutionary constraints.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Philosophically-thinking (as opposed to evolutionarily-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; self-preservation thinking) perhaps we should value and promote the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;extropy&quot; of an individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is no self, and no consciousnes, then there is no individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So there is litlte meaning in being humanist at all. I need more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence before I will change my beliefs that deeply.
</em><br>
<p>I was actually thinking of a greatly expanded form of consciousness, but a
<br>
greatly diminished sense of individual self.
<br>
<p>Yes, I admire and appreciate humanist thinking, and I am suggesting some
<br>
form of post-humanist thinking will turn out to be more useful for the
<br>
future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; On this basis, I strongly disagree with Lee's assertion that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; life of an 85-year old is less valuable than that of a 15-year old.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In extropic terms, I think carrying on the 85 year-old knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; base (given the means to do that)  is much more valuable.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; evolutionary-based terms, of course, it feels right to value the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 15-year old who can better carry on the genetic legacy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is not all. It is also a question of &quot;economics.&quot; What will give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most years of high quality?
</em><br>
<p>Clearly the example above calls for a more detailed response.
<br>
<p>85 year old:
<br>
Carries a great deal of knowledge, and more highly refined heuristics.  Of
<br>
course those heuristics may be predominately out of date and therefore of
<br>
doubtful utility.
<br>
Remaining lifespan (currently) quite limited, but are we considering
<br>
cryopreservation?
<br>
Hedonistic value:  Quite limited due to decreased vitality, short remaining
<br>
years.
<br>
Selfish gene value:  Quite low.
<br>
<p>15 year old:
<br>
Relatively little knowledge, but most of it fresh and current.
<br>
High energy may be applied to creativity.
<br>
Remaining lifespan quite long (but when practical life extension arrives,
<br>
this item cancels out.)
<br>
Hedonistic value:  Potential for a relatively long and enjoyable life
<br>
Selfish gene value: Quite high
<br>
<p>You can choose either, depending on your values.  I tend to prefer knowledge
<br>
over hedonism.  Others see it exactly opposite.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The flesh is only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interface that allows us to experience the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What is this &quot;us&quot; you speak of, Human?  It is confusing to think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; somehow &quot;you&quot; are separate from &quot;the world&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that is exactly the point! I am the state and the process. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state and process can be extracted and run in another computing media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than this wetware. By current technology standards I am coupled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together with the flesh, but theoretically it is possible to extract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;me&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I agree with this functionalist definition of self, and I'm suggesting that
<br>
we expand it to be more consistent with our future potential and
<br>
opportunities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It's a stretch to say that mathematics can be self aware.  It might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be more useful to say that self-awareness is an emergent property of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; certain information-processing systems, which can be described by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mathematics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes that is more precise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So the amusing thing is that, given enough time, it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possible to run a program with a pencil, on a piece paper, that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intelligence and conscience. If you stop writing the life ends and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you kill your 'creature'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What is this &quot;life&quot; you speak of, Human?  To make sense of this, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can only refer to information processing. If the program is written
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such that it has the feedback loops we call self-awareness, then it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can be said to be conscious, without implying anything mystical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not implying anything mystical at all. But it is mind bending to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think about. You remember, like being a child an imagining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endlessnes of the Universe.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I know and enjoy that feeling of discovery, and it's also mind-bending
<br>
to take the functionalist theory of consciousness and consider expanding it
<br>
beyond the individual self.  Replace the current motivations of
<br>
pleasure-seeking and self-preservation with ....what?  Any thoughts on this?
