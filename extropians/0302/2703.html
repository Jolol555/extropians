</em><br>
<p>### The state.
<br>
-----------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; You would be still free to burn and pollute as you want to, except
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; when you actually harm another person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe I didn't get the clue, but as I understand it, a dangerous /
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polluting industry would still not be stopped by public will, as long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as it delivers enough profit to pay the insurance.
</em><br>
<p>### This is correct. Now, lest you think that it's only me who is such a
<br>
ruthless profit-shark:
<br>
<p>The average human life does not have an infinite price, simply because the
<br>
average human has neither infinite resources nor the will to use all of what
<br>
he has to protect the lives of others. You are an example - you support both
<br>
in word and in deed your electricity provider by paying for their product,
<br>
although you could refuse to avoid complicity. At the same time this power
<br>
provider kills large numbers of people, both employees and third-party
<br>
citizens. The only way to stop that is to forbid the production of
<br>
electricity but for your own benefit you choose to accept this
<br>
dangerous/polluting industry, because you believe that your own utility
<br>
outweighs the harm to others.
<br>
<p>An insurance system represents one of the ways of balancing the utility of
<br>
customers with the harm to others, using economic measures of efficiency,
<br>
and usually what amounts to a price on human life set by the courts. A
<br>
regulatory regime, forbidding the operation of certain industries, attempts
<br>
to achieve roughly the same goal, a balance of benefit and harm, using
<br>
political methods.
<br>
<p>As almost always, a market-based system with appropriate information-flows
<br>
will outperform a monopoly run by politicians. This is why regulations are
<br>
less efficient, allow harm to more people and stifle more economic activity,
<br>
than a regulated insurance system where decisions are flexibly made by
<br>
thousands of independent entrepreneurs.
<br>
<p>-----------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The problem of
<br>
<em>&gt; pollution would become only an economical equation: How much profit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can we draw out of a business, before we have to pay for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences, regardless of the damages produces in between. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about global consequences? We still don't know how much we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for the damage to the ozone layer, the global warming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we still don't know for sure, what the consequences will be.
</em><br>
<p>### Exactly. If you don't know you are doing harm (=there is no credible
<br>
evidence you are doing harm), you should feel free to do whatever you are
<br>
doing, until evidence appears to discourage your activity.
<br>
<p>--------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;But
<br>
<em>&gt; in the meanwhile, the companies responsible go bancrupt, the persons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who were in charge retire or die, and maybe we all are responsible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a certain degree. How could any court ever decide such a case and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much money is a premature death by lung cancer worth?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### This is why I am talking about a regulated insurance market, where an
<br>
insurance company would be liable long after the offending company is gone.
<br>
<p>The court must be presented with scientifically valid evidence of harm being
<br>
done by the defendant to the plaintiff, this is they way courts decide cases
<br>
(or at least should, IMO). You cannot sue the whole world (as in &quot;we all are
<br>
responsible&quot;). The value of a lung cancer death could be calculated by the
<br>
loss of QALY (quality-adjusted life-years), multiplied by a constant, which
<br>
might be set globally e.g. by analysis of randomly selected samples of the
<br>
population, presented with choices describing the human life prices and
<br>
their financial consequences (changes in their own insurance premiums and
<br>
prices of various commodities). I am quite open about the optimal procedure
<br>
for pricing human lives.
