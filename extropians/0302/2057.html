<p>To which Emlyn responded to me:
<br>
<p>&quot;If you don't see Eugen unsubbing as a loss, then you are a fool.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thank you, Emlyn, for illustrating precisely what I mean. I put forth an 
<br>
argument defining my position, and am met with an insult. I meant no malice 
<br>
toward Mr. Leitl personally, I am merely pointing out that it isn't worth 
<br>
leaving over a position you aren't willing to defend. Not everyone thinks 
<br>
that action in Iraq is necessarily a bad idea. In fact, several have argued 
<br>
that is extropic and transhuman to endorse such an action, and that not 
<br>
supporting it is detrimental to both movements. That doesn't make them 
<br>
&quot;warmongers&quot;, or puppets of the United States government. If you are 
<br>
unwilling to hear different point of views, or at best merely label them with 
<br>
insults, then why participate on the forum to begin with?
<br>
<p>Regards,
