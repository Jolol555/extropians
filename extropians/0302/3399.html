<p><em>&gt; Lee I believe I understand the point you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presented.  [But] Now I will ask again, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to highlight this situation as reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Question: If America wars against Iraq, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will those individuals and governments do to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retaliate against the United States?  Will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this retaliation be effective?
</em><br>
<p>In my opinion, there is little they can do that
<br>
they're not already doing.  To be sure, various
<br>
future terrorist attacks may claim, &quot;This is
<br>
in revenge for your conquest of Iraq!&quot;, but I
<br>
think it's unlikely that additional people who
<br>
don't already hate the U.S./U.K. will suddenly
<br>
start to.
<br>
<p>On the contrary, there is a good chance that in
<br>
that part of the world, folks respect strength
<br>
even more than here.  But aside from all that
<br>
speculation, the means to attack the West---
<br>
Iraqi WMD and al Qaeda money, which will find
<br>
each other if they haven't already---will be
<br>
damaged.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; As for &quot;today, yes, it's Iraq, but tomorrow it may be Iceland&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that is so silly it hardly deserves comment.  I can just see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ten years of pressure from dozens and dozens of countries,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; innumerable U.N. resolutions, thousands of flights over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Iceland to figure out just what those scoundrels are up to,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; etc., etc.  ;-)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; That isn't silly.  The next place is never any place you thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be.
</em><br>
<p>The world's intelligence agencies are pretty good.  They knew
<br>
what kind of problem Korea and Iraq would pose.  Observe the
<br>
American Intelligence Community's predictions made in 2000:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/globaltrends2015/">http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/globaltrends2015/</a>
<br>
<p>Not bad (though it's quite a bit to skim through).  Anyway,
<br>
Ron, some may have an inability to see the next enemy, but
<br>
it would be absolutely incredible if any random nation, e.g.
<br>
Iceland, was the world's next hot spot.
