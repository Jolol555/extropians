</em><br>
<p>This may well be correct.  But just try to prove it.  To prove it you 
<br>
need to be able to put limits on the &quot;noise&quot; that may possibly occur.  
<br>
With current theories, the larger the noise pulse required, the less 
<br>
probable the transition, but there doesn't seem any obvious way to stick 
<br>
an absolute limit on the potential size of the transition. 
<br>
<p>In particular, certain circumstances allow quantum fluctuations to 
<br>
cascade to the macroscopic level (geiger counters and bubble chambers, 
<br>
to pick two obvious examples).  So a random change at the quantum level 
<br>
results in an observable change at the macroscopic level.  Clearly if 
<br>
there are parallel universes, this kind of change would result in a 
<br>
universe where someone either did or didnot publish a paper.  This could 
<br>
lead various people to differing conclusions, resulting in different 
<br>
actions.  Etc.
<br>
<p>There is no obvious way to limit the differences.  Depending on the 
<br>
paper, it could have resulted in, during WWII, the US not persuing the 
<br>
atomic bomb project.  (That was a rather close call in this universe, 
<br>
and I think that everyone would agree that it had a rather dramatic 
<br>
effect at the macroscopic level.)
<br>
<p>So if there are parallel universes, then they will usually stay closely 
<br>
similar, but on rare occasions one will make an improbable transition, 
<br>
or rather a transition in an improbably environment, that will lead to a 
<br>
cascade of changes such that the two resultant universes would 
<br>
observably different at the macroscopic level.  And I think that a good 
<br>
argument could be made that such transitions are rare.  But this is 
<br>
quite different from saying that they don't happen.  (It's 
<br>
interesting... I began this with a model of a continuum of universe 
<br>
states, and have ended up much closer to the sheaves of similar 
<br>
universes that are a stape of parallel worlds in science fiction.)
<br>
<p>Also remember how evolution works.  It's small changes piled on small 
<br>
changes compounded over time.  What isn't obvious on our scale may be 
<br>
important on another.  Who knows how dependant the firing of synapses is 
<br>
to the noise lever?  This would be a very effective way of achieving 
<br>
macroscopically different universes with no visible sign for the cause 
<br>
of the divergence.  Again, this would be a random process, with firing 
<br>
being either enhanced or discourages in a random manner.  But this 
<br>
process  would lead even closely adjacent universes to diverge quickly 
<br>
at the observable level.
<br>
<p>A question might exist as to whether or not this differentiation is 
<br>
instantaneous, propagates at the speed of light, or perhaps propagates 
<br>
at the speed of Wigner's paradox ... i.e., only with the transmission of 
<br>
information.  OTOH, this may not be a meaningful question.  It's not 
<br>
clear that it's possible, even in principle, to distinguish between 
<br>
these variants.  Which is, itself, the major argument against the 
<br>
multi-worlds hypothesis.  There's no obvious way to test it!  I once 
<br>
tried to model gravity as a force that operated in 4 dimensions through 
<br>
the adjacent parallel universes.  I eventually concluded that a) the 
<br>
definition of distance was quite peculiar and b) it didn't buy me 
<br>
anything.  Quantuum fluctuation is only going to affect gravity if it 
<br>
causes the government to get ready so that it shoots away the asteroid 
<br>
that would otherwise crash into the planet and either significantly 
<br>
change it's orbit or some such.  In that case, those on the surviving 
<br>
side could check their gravitational constants to see if there were any 
<br>
change, but barring some such event as that, the hypothesis appears 
<br>
unverifyable.
