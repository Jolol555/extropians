<p><em>&gt; Originally, Hubert, you wrote (and I quote)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For the very very first time in the 48 years of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life I feel a faint pride to be citizen of a nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that does not agree with US aggression all over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; globe, though its representatives may surrender at last.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, either you must stand behind what you wrote, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintain that that the U.S. is guilty of aggression all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the globe, or you must clarify.  Which is it to be?
</em><br>
<p>Guilty of aggression all over the globe as a FUTURE possibility IF the
<br>
imperialistic dreams that John Grigg - possibly ironically, which I was not
<br>
able to detect - displayed in his letter as an example of the imperialistic
<br>
attitude of invading one country after another that does not fit into
<br>
Washington's concept.
<br>
<p>Call me what you will or think of me what you will. I will not engage in
<br>
mind games about better or worse superpowers anymore. I am sick of being in
<br>
the position where I must justify my peace loving attitude. This is
<br>
absolutely ridiculous.
<br>
<p>All of you, who are so war horny today, YOU (plural) are the ones who should
<br>
ask yourselves if you still have anything to do with transhumanism. One of
<br>
the most original and intelligent minds of this movement - EUGEN LEITL - has
<br>
already unsubscribed extropy list because he could't stand the battle cries
<br>
here on this list any more. This is huge loss for the movement.
<br>
<p>No power has the right to attack a country even if a monster of a dictator
<br>
rules there. The US/UK junta is going to ignite a world fire pretty soon and
<br>
the
<br>
supporters of war among you know it.
<br>
<p>Love, Peace, Over And Out

<em>&gt; &gt; Lee Corbin asked:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Aggression all over the globe!&quot;  Ha!  You make it sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; like the U.S. is being run by the likes of Hitler or Stalin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, we witness the historically peculiar spectacle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a superpower meekly asking everyone in the world whether or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not they think it's a good idea, and timidly begging for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; UN approval.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Read John Grigg's letter where he dreamed like an eight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; year old boy of invading country after country!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also asked you to imagine what it would be like if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single superpower like the U.S.S.R. or Nazi Germany were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the U.S.'s place.  Would that be incomparably worse,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not?
