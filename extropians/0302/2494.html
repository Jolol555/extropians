<p><em>&gt; It's true that in a infinite number of universes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hideous things beyond description happen to you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it is equally true that in a infinite number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of universes wonderful things beyond imagining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen to you; it seems to me the most logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional state regarding parallel universes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be neutral.
</em><br>
<p>I basically agree.  David Pearce (www.hedweb.com) has always
<br>
worried greatly about the &quot;hell branches&quot;, as he calls them,
<br>
of the MWI.  But he his not taking your balancing hypothesis
<br>
to heart.
<br>
<p>For what it's worth, when I thought about these things as
<br>
a teenager, the evil of suffering in my mind completely
<br>
outweighed the beneficence of pleasure, joy, satisfaction,
<br>
and contentment in the world.  I even went so far at age
<br>
eighteen to announce to friends that I would destroy the
<br>
world if I could for this very reason.
<br>
<p>This is somewhat typical of the way teens value life and
<br>
living, and explains why the Marine Corps rejoices in
<br>
their recruitment.  (It's a lot harder to get a 26 year
<br>
old to charge a machine-gun nest.)  As adults, we are
<br>
constantly amazed at the risk-taking prevalent among
<br>
the young.
<br>
<p>(For me, this *valuation of life* has only continued to
<br>
increase over the decades.  I wonder if that's a general
<br>
reaction---or perhaps it's just that each succeeding
<br>
decade has been slightly better *for me*.)
<br>
<p>Isn't the following true?  Some patients experiencing
<br>
unbearable pain are given control of a wire into their
<br>
pleasure center, with instructions to press it whenever
<br>
the pain becomes absolutely intolerable, but only then.
<br>
The patients report that they are restored to a state
<br>
of normalcy, with the evidently incredible pleasure
<br>
balancing the incredible pain.  For some reason, this
<br>
subjective result doesn't surprise me---why shouldn't
<br>
our brains be capable of such subconscious integration?
<br>
<p>(What I have never understood about this result, however,
<br>
is how it comes to pass that the patient doesn't try the
<br>
button ever more often, ending up as addicted as one of
<br>
Larry Niven's &quot;wireheads&quot;, or one of those rats who forego
<br>
as long as they live food, drink, and sex in favor of 
<br>
pressing the button.)
