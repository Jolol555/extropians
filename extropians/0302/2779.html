<em>&gt; &gt; Rather than hurling statements back and forth that selegiline does

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually that is not what we've been doing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would much rather see comments on the exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mechanism that selegiline is supposed to work from and an evaluation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as to when it might and might not work for individuals with specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain chemistry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have posted about 8 or 12 research abstracts about the subject, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of which describe possible mechanisms of action in some detail. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest you go back and read them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At one point in this discussion I suggested to Rafal that we should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debating how selegiline is neuroprotective, not whether it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuroprotective, but he has continued to stonewall on the subject of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether it works for this purpose at all. This despite my having posted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numerous animal studies and one human study showing evidence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuroprotection and life-extension by selegiline.
</em><br>
<p>### Yeah, in rats, etc. No evidence in humans at all.
<br>
<p>Why bother arguing about a mechanism if it has never been proven to work in
<br>
the first place?
<br>
<p>------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rafal hangs his hat on a single study in which selegiline (deprenyl)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slowed the progression of Parkinson's disease symptoms (a remarkable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result!) but in which the drug was not found to actually extend the life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those same Parkinson's patients.
</em><br>
<p>### I explained before but can do it again: selegiline did not slow the
<br>
progression of symptoms, merely symptomatically delayed the time to
<br>
levodopa, as shown by the loss of efficacy during washout.
<br>
<p>One class II study outweighs an infinite number of class IV or animal
<br>
studies, just as one word of a genius weighs more than the babble of a
<br>
thousand morons.
<br>
<p>--------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Meanwhile, a large number of studies
<br>
<em>&gt; in animals (and one admittedly less well controlled study in humans)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give us strong evidence that it does in fact protect neurons and extend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life. Other studies show that it enhances cognitive ability -- in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selegiline is approved for this purpose for veterinary purposes under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the trade name Anipryl. If your old dog is acting senile, you can tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your vet about it and get a prescription for Anipryl (selegiline). No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt it would be approved for human cognitive enhancement as well if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only our conservative medical establishment were more willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider as valid the pursuit of life enhancement by pharmaceutical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means in people not formally diagnosed with disease. The pharmaceutical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industry and the researchers they sponsor are interested in finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cures and treatments for sick people -- they are not very interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bettering the health of well people, and so almost no research dollars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flow toward that end.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I've mentioned here in the past, the most likely mechanism by which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selegiline (deprenyl) extends lifespan is via neuroprotection by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upregulation of SOD and catalase in the central nervous system. These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are two natural antioxidants that have been shown to be associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased life-expectancy in other anti-aging experiments totally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unrelated to selegiline.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The theoretical pieces of the puzzle all fit together to me, but then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancement of human life by nutritional and pharmaceutical means is my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business. I am a consultant in this field.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### Then you should know the difference between the value of uncontrolled or
<br>
animal studies you quote, which are class IV or no evidence at all, and
<br>
class II, controlled ones. Basically you are wasting other people's money
<br>
trying to get them to buy a medicine proven not to work in humans with PD,
<br>
and never proven to work in extending the lives of aging humans.
<br>
<p>Waste of time, too.
