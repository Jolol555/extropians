<em>&gt; Instead of replying to your long post, which seems 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Sorry about that. There was a lot of repetition. But given
<br>
the gloom in the downside that there is also a significant 
<br>
upside opportunity is I think worth repeating a bit. I haven't
<br>
heard much said in the media about a possible upside for the
<br>
United Nations from this process. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; let me point to this essay written by Richard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Holbrooke, who was U.S. ambassador to the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nations under President Clinton. He argues that we don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need a second resolution, and shouldn't have asked for one. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually he doesn't lay out any line of reasoned argument for
<br>
not needing a second resolution he just states it. I disagree with
<br>
his conclusion. 
<br>
<p>There will be lots of disagreement about whether a new resolution
<br>
is required right up until a new resolution is signed. That is part of
<br>
the politics of spin. Spin works largely because many people won't
<br>
reason things out for themselves. I have heard or read, Rice, Bush
<br>
and Negroponte all say that a new resoltion is not required. Well
<br>
it clearly is true that its not required if the US is willing to breach the
<br>
Charter.
<br>
<p>I've also heard it said that &quot;the final opportunity&quot; has past. Well thats
<br>
statement can be made as an opinion or as a judgement. When anyone
<br>
other than the Security Council says it, (including me), its an opinion
<br>
only the Security Council can say it as a judgement.
<br>
<p>My argument here is based on a line of reasoning from 1441 that is 
<br>
available for anyone to check in the original post. My argument is that
<br>
the US signed over authority to interpret the meaning of key terms
<br>
such as &quot;one final opportunity&quot;, &quot;further material breach&quot; and &quot;serious
<br>
consequences&quot; to the Security Council when they signed off on 1441.
