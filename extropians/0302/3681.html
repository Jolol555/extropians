<p><em>&gt; In the 28th Feb. 2003 issue of Science, there is an advance article 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a soon-to-be-published paper that theoretically shows the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility of having a &quot;motion&quot; without propulsion (i.e. not using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Newton's Third Law). Written by Jack Wisdom of MIT, the highly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical and complicated paper reveals a motion similar to when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one is sitting on a swivel chair and by thrusting one's arm in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific directions, one can make the chair turns. It is the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect that happens when a cat falls down and lands on its feet - by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twisting its torso.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This new paper deals with the same idea and involves with a curved 4D 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spacetime. By stretching and retracting the &quot;limbs&quot; of a body, Wisdom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showed that one can &quot;swim&quot; through a curved spacetime. Interestingly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough, and just like the swivel chair case where one can change 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's orientation but not spin, in this &quot;swim&quot; one can change one's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position but not the overall velocity.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't read this yet, but a few comments in advance:
<br>
<p>I remember an article in Scientific American several years ago about how
<br>
you could change your body's orientation even if you were floating in
<br>
space, by waving your arms and legs around properly.  You'd think it's
<br>
impossible, by conservation of angular momentum, but it's not; in fact,
<br>
that law is what allows it to happen.  For example, you can swing your
<br>
arm in a circle, and by conservation of angular momentum your body will
<br>
start rotating in the other direction.  I think some satellites use this
<br>
method to control their orientation, by spinning internal flywheels.
<br>
<p>It does sound plausible that you could do something similar for position
<br>
in curved space.  I'll bet the problem in practice is that space around
<br>
here is curved too slightly, it is too close to flat.  The strong-seeming
<br>
1G acceleration fields around earth are microscopic when expressed in
<br>
geometric coordinates based on the speed of light.  You'd need to swim
<br>
up to a neutron star or a black hole to get any considerable amount of
<br>
spacetime curvature which would be necessary for &quot;traction&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, I know what you're thinking: how about conservation of momentum?
<br>
If you move from point A to point B to point C, don't you have a velocity?
<br>
and therefore a momentum?  But you started with zero momentum.  How does
<br>
that work?
<br>
<p>Well, I'm not sure.  I suspect what happens is that in curved space,
<br>
any global coordinate system is going to have some disagrements about
<br>
velocities, as measured from place to place.  Therefore you can move
<br>
around without breaking the rules because you change which rules apply
<br>
as you move.  You change the local coordinate system by which you are
<br>
judging your velocity.  Your velocity is always zero as measured locally,
<br>
always non-zero as measured remotely, and that's what allows you to move.
<br>
<p>That's just a guess.  In any case this is an amazing result, like a
<br>
real-life version of the mythical Dean Drive (or Mike Lorrey's Drive)
<br>
which was supposed to produce propulsion without reaction.  However if
<br>
my intuition is correct, this drive will not produce acceleration,
<br>
rather the (pseudo) velocity will be constant and proportional to the
<br>
curvature of space.  Hence it would not be practical for space tr  You'd
<br>
crawl along at one nanometer per second or whatever, and eventually you'd
<br>
reach the moon, but no one would care any more by the time you got there.
<br>
because no matter how long you left it on, you wouldn't speed up.
