<p>Congratulations.  Yes, its blindingly obvious to some, and yet to others, 
<br>
they never see the following point:
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is no soul, as I am convinced. And if uploading is possible, as I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinced, then the I/mind is just the calculations taking place inside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain. It is not the brain itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well this has been obvious for me for a long time. But what freaked me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out a bit, is that it is not the flesh that has conscience but the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'calculations' that is done in the flesh. And the flesh is only the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interface that allows us to experience the world.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, if you *DO* want to believe in a soul, then its a little freakier, 
<br>
since the only consistent definition of the soul is a thing attached to those 
<br>
calculations.  Ie, its the MATHEMATICAL PROCESS which has the soul...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the amusing thing is that, given enough time, it should be possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to run a program with a pencil, on a piece paper, that has intelligence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and conscience. If you stop writing the life ends and you kill your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'creature'.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  One of the precepts of Strong AI is that any sufficiently powerful 
<br>
computer can simulate a human brain and its thoughts, including intelligence. 
<br>
And its an already established fact that any powerful computer can be 
<br>
simulated (at a mind-numbing slowdown of speed) with pencil and paper...
<br>
<p>But to pick at a nit:  When you stop writing, say for a bathroom break, the 
<br>
life you are simulating doesn't die, it just stops till you return.  When you 
<br>
continue the process, even if years later, the life's mind continues thinking 
<br>
from where it was last. Depending on circumstances, it may never even notice 
<br>
the gap in its conciousness. Its not until the paper with all the notes on it 
<br>
is destroyed that the life is definitely gone.  Even if you die, and your 
<br>
friends bind all of your notes together and put the resulting book on a shelf 
<br>
and forget about it, the life it represents is simply held in abeyance. One 
<br>
day, perhaps in a few centuries, some curious sole might continue the 
<br>
simulation...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This opens up for all kinds of oportunities for where life can exist.
</em><br>
<p>Last weekend, a friend and I were trying to invent the strangest intelligent 
<br>
aliens we could think of. One of my friends entries was a carefully-designed 
<br>
political system. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It makes you wonder if life can suddenly come into spontaneous existence from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the computations that is taking place on the net. I cannot see why not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shurely it cannot be a worse medium than atoms in water. Unless it is too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deterministic.
</em><br>
<p>Its way too SMALL so far.  Atoms in water are MASSIVELY parallel. We're many 
<br>
orders of magnitude away from an Internet of sufficient size that you can 
<br>
expect that sort of thing to happen spontaneously. (And thats not even 
<br>
counting the fact that in many ways the internet is a more hostile place than 
<br>
the ancient seas were.)
