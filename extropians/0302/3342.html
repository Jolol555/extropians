Some Selected Miserable Melodies (mostly in the worst rating category)
Ashcroft, John: Let The Mighty Eagle Soar SOURCE: CNN.com
&quot;Ashcroft sings-U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft ended a speech
at a Charlotte, North Carolina seminary with a rousing rendition of
a song he wrote called 'Let The Eagles Soar' (February 25).

Rating: Awful
Foster-Jenkins, Florence: Queen of Night
&quot;For Madame Jenkins' shortcomings as an artiste were nothing short
of awesome. A dumpy coloratura soprano, her voice was not even
mediocre - it was preposterous! She clucked and squawked, trumpeted
and quavered. She couldn't carry a tune. Her sense of rhythm was
uncertain. In the treacherous upper registers, her voice often
vanished into thin air, leaving an audience with its ear cocked for
notes with which she might just as well have never taxed her
throat. One critic dolefully described her as 'the first lady of
the sliding scale.' Peevishly remarked another: 'She sounds like a
cuckoo in its cups.'&quot;

Rating: Auditory Torture
Iglesias, Enrique: Rhythm Divine
&quot;This is a live performance of Enrique Iglesias where his microphone
is isolated, much like the Linda McCartney Hey Jude auditory
torture. I guess we know Enrique is human, after all.&quot;

Rating: Auditory Torture
Ono, Yoko: Don't Worry
&quot;The full name of this is &quot;Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking
For Her Hand In The Snow)&quot; and what this means - I have no idea.
This one really scares animals and be careful; it might make your
head spin.&quot;

Rating: Auditory Torture
Portsmouth Sinfonia: Also Sprach Zarathustra
&quot;This orchestra, made half of professional musicians, and
half of amateurs, really slaughters this one.&quot;

Rating: Auditory Torture
Reynolds, Burt: I Didn't Shake The World Today
&quot;He didn't shake the world with this song or the album for
that matter. &quot;

Rating: Auditory Torture
Shatner, William: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
&quot;Picture yourself in a studio with an actor...this is another
William Shatner classic. &quot;

Rating: Auditory Torture
Zonk, Harry: For What It's Worth
&quot;This is pretty hysterical. A guy is tap dancing to an instrumental
version of Buffalo Springfield's 'For What It's Worth.'&quot;
