<p>I was wondering what you were referring to when you mentioned the US using 
<br>
faked evidence to justify its wars in Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, and 
<br>
Grenada.  I'm not saying that I disagree, just that I am ignorant of what 
<br>
you are referring to.  I've heard that the Kuwaiti government in exile lied 
<br>
about what was happening back home to secure the assistance of the US and 
<br>
UN, but that could hardly be what you are talking about.  Likewise, I know 
<br>
that the Gulf of Tonkin incident turned out to be the imagination of the 
<br>
commander on the scene, and LBJ probably should have been able to figure 
<br>
this out by the time he addressed the US senate on the matter.  Please clarify.
