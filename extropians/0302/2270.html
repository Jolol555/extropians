ct quoted a news release about possible cardiovascular side-effects of
<br>
levodopa
<br>
<p><p>### Yes, I heard about it. What does it have to do with selegiline?
<br>
<p>Since dopa-sparing with selegiline does not prolong survival in PD (as shown
<br>
by DATATOP), any findings about levodopa's side effects are irrelevant here
<br>
because we already know selegiline wouldn't make any difference.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; levodopa-requiring level of symptomatology, not a reduction in total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk. At the same time, there was no delay in time to dyskinesias on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levodopa, and no delay of death. In other words, patients treated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with selegiline had the same or higher level of disability as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patients on levodopa, levodopa became equally ineffective at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, and they died at the same rate. The delay to levodopa is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strictly due to the symptomatic effect of selegiline
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As background: there was once a hypothesis that levodopa accelerates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the attrition of dopaminergic neurons, and that levodopa-sparing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therapy would delay the onset of dyskinesias which usually develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after about 5-7 years on levodopa, and perhaps prolong survival. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nice hypothesis, but not true - substituting dopa-agonists or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selegiline for levodopa in initial treatment does not delay the onset
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of dyskinesia. ... Rafal

<em>&gt; Parkinson's disease: gold standard drug causes heart problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Research has shown that levodopa can increase the risk of heart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disease in Parkinson's patients.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; January 30, 2003 3:58 PM GMT (Datamonitor) - A study published in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Archives of Neurology suggests a link between levodopa and increased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homocysteine levels. This new evidence of adverse side effects will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase the demand for treatments that can delay the need for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levodopa. Competition will be strong in the $2 billion market and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pharmacia and GSK are leading the way with their dopamine agonists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mirapex and Requip respectively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People with Parkinson's disease (PD) who take the drug levodopa
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appear to have a higher than average risk of heart disease, according
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Dallas. However, researchers stress it is not clear whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levodopa itself raises heart disease risks. Experts believe these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preliminary findings &quot;raise certain concerns&quot; about the safety of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levodopa, but are not meant to discourage people from taking the drug.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PD affects over 560,000 people in the US. It is a progressive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degenerative condition of the central nervous system, characterized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postural instability. Levodopa works by replacing levels of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain, although continued use is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associated with undesirable movement side effects known as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dyskinesias. Moreover, the treatment cannot slow disease progression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and works only to alleviate the symptoms. After experiencing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively static five years, the PD market is set to grow with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent emphasis on the dopamine agonist class of drugs, which are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recommended as first-line monotherapy. The leading players,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GlaxoSmithKline and Pharmacia, will drive this growth with ReQuip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (ropinirole) and Mirapex (pramipexole) respectively. The market is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also set to expand with the emergence of revolutionary combination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drug strategies that aim to reduce levodopa induced motor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fluctuations and dyskinesias, as well as neuroprotective therapies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that delay disease progression. Levodopa remains the gold standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment of PD, despite being over 30 years old and the emergence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new drug classes. It is now highly generacized, although controlled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; release versions of Roche's Madopar and BMS-DuPont's Sinemet are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular levodopa therapies in Europe and US respectively. Even so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the high volume of sales means the market for levodopa therapies is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth over a billion dollars. This new evidence to suggest a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heightened risk of heart disease will increase the need for therapies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can further delay levodopa treatment.
