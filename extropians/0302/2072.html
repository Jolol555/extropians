<p>
The proper way to dispose of high-level waste is to irradiate it inside the 
<br>
reactor vessel to promote it's decay to stable isotopes. There are several 
<br>
power reactor designs out there that will do this without ever requiring 
<br>
the waste to leave the containment building.
<br>
<p>Shielding is not difficult - what's hard is to ensure that the waste dump 
<br>
remains unmolested for a hundred thousand years or more, until the 
<br>
longer-lived isotopes decay. We have several methods of sealing spent fuel 
<br>
into glass so it cannot enter the environment, but the glass itself needs 
<br>
to be stored away from inquisitive persons...
<br>
<p>The only way to eliminate the heat load of technology on the surface of the 
<br>
planet is to eliminate the technology - something that is dear to the 
<br>
hearts of too many enviro-wackos out there.
