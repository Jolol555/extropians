This phrase is so common now that it can be found on ClichéSite.com.
<br>
<a href="http://www.clichesite.com/index.asp">http://www.clichesite.com/index.asp</a>
<br>
Cliché:  Dogs bark, but the caravan moves on
<br>
Country: Saudi Arabia
<br>
<p>Most sources say it is an old Arab or Oriental proverb. It has been
<br>
claimed also as North African, Moroccan, Lebanese, Kurdish, Persian,
<br>
Turkish, Russian, Balkan, Creole!?, English (late 19thC). I think the
<br>
only safe claim is that originally it came from a country that had
<br>
caravans passing through! It is now in widespread use throughout the
<br>
world, both in ordinary speech and in writings by many authors.
<br>
<p>Some claim it for the Lebanese poet, philosopher and artist, Khalil
<br>
Gibran (1883-1931).
<br>
Others claim it for the Algerian writer Kateb Yassin or Yacine
<br>
(1929-1989).
<br>
But my feeling is that the saying is older than both of them. They both
<br>
wrote mostly in French so it would be the well-known French proverb,
<br>
'Les chiens aboient, la caravane passe.'
<br>
<p>Turkish: It urur, kervan yurur. -(Dogs bark, but the caravan goes on.)
<br>
<p>The meaning is much the same in all countries:
<br>
Illustrates the situation where many minor characters may be vocal and
<br>
loud, but the main idea or project will continue to progress.
<br>
He who is sure of his way does not let himself be diverted by the
<br>
noisiest disapproval.
<br>
Often used to put down someone's efforts or words, meaning that it
<br>
won't have any effect on the outcome. In this sense it is regarded as a
<br>
rude but effective expression.
<br>
<p>Interesting search, though.
