<em>&gt; &gt; I think LDC is not a big fan of nations, and I certainly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree with him on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that one. Ignoring them is not an option, however, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declaring them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dinosaurs wont stop me becoming T-Rex breakfast.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that one must grant nations /practical/ import, the same way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one must recognize the physical power of the government you live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under to jail you or worse.  I may not agree with the IRS or the DEA,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I pay taxes and don't smoke pot because I don't relish the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being gang-raped in the shower by men whom the state had more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimate reasons to imprison.  But the post to which I was replying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemed to imply that nations had some /moral/ import; he seemed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that the protesters were &quot;anti-American&quot;, as if there were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something wrong with that.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed you were. I was speaking to other posts more than your own, excuse me
<br>
for any confusion caused.
