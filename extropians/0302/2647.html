</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I guess the 'polarizing incident' is a correct assessment.  I have a 
<br>
real problem with the fact that the vast majority of times I've talked to a 
<br>
proponent of theory &lt;X&gt; and said &quot;You know, the recent discovery of &lt;Y&gt; is 
<br>
inconsistent with this theory&quot;, the response has been a personal attack. 
<br>
Usually it takes the form of an assumption that I must be in some non-&lt;X&gt; 
<br>
camp, or that I therefore believe any number of insane theories from the 
<br>
lunatic fringe.
<br>
<p>Its been rather rare, but refreshing, when the answer is a shrug and an 
<br>
&quot;Well, we're looking into that. We may need to change the theory.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I know that that is the &quot;myth&quot; promoted by the sciences. You obviously don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;work with real scientists doing real research.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you?
</em><br>
<p>Depends on your definitions. I started off in nuclear physics (with a leaning 
<br>
towards cosmology) and have had occasion to work with such people in the 
<br>
past. Currently I do research and development in software, which is related, 
<br>
but isn't really the same thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here are a few good links on the cosmology field: basics as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research (especially where the observations do and do not fit) and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and where the cosmologists are studying the different facets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cosmology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Thanks, but I don't really need an introduction to cosmology, as I've read 
<br>
about it extensively in the past (although I admit not much in the last 3 
<br>
years, due to time pressures.)
<br>
<p>If your point was that there is real research going on in the field, with 
<br>
real adherence to the principles of the scientific method, I never doubted it 
<br>
for a moment.  How else would we have any progress to show?
<br>
<p>I'm not anti-science, just anti-stupidity, and the point I was attempting to 
<br>
make was that stupidity and rigidity of thought are as prevalent in the 
<br>
sciences as everywhere else, and (as far as I can discern) in roughly the 
<br>
same proportions as in any other field of human endeavour including, for 
<br>
example, business administration.
<br>
<p>I was initially very surprised at this, since I had always assumed the 
<br>
sciences would be self-selecting for the best and the brightest, and that 
<br>
scientists would be interested foremost in the truth, and would not heavily 
<br>
invest ego into whatever theory they currently favoured. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not a cosmologist, but it never occurred to me to pick a technical field
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and formulate a rant against all people working in that field. That's rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bold.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't singled out the cosmologists by any means. In fact, its probably, 
<br>
at the moment, one of the more active points of innovation in the pure 
<br>
sciences, precisely because (I would guess), there are enough new and 
<br>
challenging discoveries being made and 'keeping the pot boiling' that me-too-
<br>
ism and concensus thought doesn't have much of a chance to set in.
<br>
<p>All that being said, you will note that the vast majority of cosmological 
<br>
press releases (including the one someone included in this thread) emphasize 
<br>
not the changes to theories that the new results will require, but how well 
<br>
they always fit with existing theories. 
<br>
<p>My own personal theory is that they are afraid that any portrayal of the most 
<br>
exciting part of scientific discovery, the &quot;Uh oh, what kind of result is 
<br>
THIS?&quot;, will somehow allow the lunatic fringe to gain a toehold and start 
<br>
announcing that the universe is shaped like a chicken, or some nonsense.
<br>
<p>This may even be correct, but it has the unfortunate side effect the media 
<br>
and many teachers (in fact, the vast majority of science teachers I've 
<br>
encountered) end up assuming that the current theory is gospel and carved in 
<br>
stone, rather than just being our current best approximation to the truth.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I hope that the above post gives a better understanding of where I 
<br>
was coming from in my last post. To bring things full circle, my original 
<br>
reply to the post that started this thread was just trying to point out that 
<br>
it is generally not possible to determine the &quot;likelyhood&quot;, &quot;strength&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;staying power&quot; or similar metric of a given theory by either consulting the 
<br>
popular press or surveying random scientists in the field. Either method will 
<br>
end up heavily biased in favor of whatever is the current big theory.
<br>
<p>I suppose you could even test this statement, given a sufficient historical 
<br>
database of now-defunct theories and the popular and private communications 
<br>
of the major scientific players in the field. Certainly, the (admittedly
<br>
small amount) that I have read on the history of scientific innovations seems 
<br>
to support my conjecture.
