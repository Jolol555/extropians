<em>&gt; What I have always wondered about is a Kantian take on                        
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all this: what if everyone took to the streets to make                        
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their voices and views on issues heard?  What if all                          
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the racists in the U.S., for example, marched to support                      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their right to their own beliefs?                                             
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be a very colorful and newsworthy weekend. Not *everyone* would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be out on the streets, since some people lack clearly defined beliefs...
</em><br>
<p>Well, focusing on my first question rather than my second,
<br>
let's suppose that everyone who had strong beliefs regularly
<br>
took to the streets to make their point.  Aren't we talking
<br>
about perhaps ten or fifteen percent of the population?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After a few days of this holiday-come-riot, everyone would end up detained,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hospitalized, or hungry and thirsty (since the shopkeepers would presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also mostly be out there demonstrating).
</em><br>
<p>This probably, if just the racists chose to demonstrate.  I still
<br>
think that if everyone acted as do the self-anointed, utter chaos
<br>
would result.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We would all definitely think we knew which meme had the greatest numbers on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its side, and we probably would all continue to disagree with each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would obtain a videocam and tape the whole thing during occasional breaks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the lab. I would do my best to convince the people I was taping that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting naked on camera would maximize the spread of their pet memes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kantian question answered.
</em><br>
<p>;-)  Well, I contend that &quot;marching&quot; to make your point
<br>
is about as uncooperative thing as you can do in a 
<br>
democratic country.  The only thing more stupid yet
<br>
exactly equally non-cooperative is &quot;general strike&quot;.
