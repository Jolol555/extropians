<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, if you read YOUR ENTIRE PARAGRAPH, [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then my question, &quot;What? are you saying might makes right?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is sensible because you explain your position by referring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the fact that these countries like Poland cannot project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military force.  And that they have no veto power.  So that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are irrelevant.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I don't see it.  Your question is still a non sequitur to
<br>
me.  I pointed out a fact, nothing more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm merely pointing out that there are only two European countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you have to take serious in the context of the Iraq conflict: Britain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and France.  Those have some non-negligible military reach, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they have veto power in the Security Council.  They are the ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for which a pro-war decision would inflict direct costs.  Everybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; else does just political posturing, which is cheap.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So everyone else should not express an opinion?
</em><br>
<p>You keep talking about expressing an opinion as if this were a
<br>
matter of free speech.  This is a matter of political alignment and
<br>
alliances to increase one own's leverage.  As I tried to explain,
<br>
there is no direct cost of taking positions, so it's all &quot;ulterior&quot;
<br>
motives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your point of view seems repugnant to some of the rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people here (doubly so, I might suggest, for the residents of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those small &quot;less significant&quot; countries).
</em><br>
<p>If I am to believe the press, the overwhelming majority of the
<br>
common people in these countries is opposed to a US-led war against
<br>
Iraq in the first place.  Whether they think that their government
<br>
should take an individual stance or try to align with some common
<br>
EU opinion, I can't judge.  Depends probably on whether they're
<br>
nationalist or pro-EU.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh yeah?  See the next section; I'm telling you that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is some kind of psychological or cultural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference going on.  You next dismiss the countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Eastern Europe as &quot;unruly children&quot; (!)
</em><br>
<p>I say that this a better discription of Chirac's statement then
<br>
your interpretation of threats and intimidation.  Those words are
<br>
far too strong.  (I think if you took some time to probe me on that
<br>
point you would find that I'm far less dismissive of Eastern Europe
<br>
than the society surrounding me.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The arrogance of looking down one's long nose at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;unruliness&quot; of these incompetent children---who should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obey their superiors---is quite remarkable, and galling.
</em><br>
<p>It's not about obeying, it's about sitting together and coming to
<br>
a common position or at least statement, versus ignoring the family
<br>
and blurting out a stance judiciously judged to be politically
<br>
profitable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hmm.  Yes.  To you, it's invisible, I guess.  So telling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the smaller countries &quot;shut up, or else&quot;, is not bullying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to you?  Or what?  (Thanks for any insight you have, here.)
</em><br>
<p>When have you stopped beating your wife?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That's just what Chirac did.  The &quot;family&quot; thing and all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, he added the &quot;or else&quot;, didn't he?  It was *not* a high-minded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lecture on unity, as I recall, but a blunt warning.  Isn't that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so?
</em><br>
<p>It was uncharacteristically out-spoken as far as French diplomacy
<br>
goes, but it was not the gag order as which you seem to make it
<br>
out.
<br>
<p>Anyway, to come back full circle to your original question:  You
<br>
seem to be under the impression that Chirac committed a terrible
<br>
gaffe with his statement, and that it would obviously considered
<br>
such domestically and internationally.  I can only negate that.
<br>
<p>It is also plain weird seeing you try to characterize France in a
<br>
way that is commonly associated with the USA in this part of the
<br>
world.
