<em>&gt; Well, Mez, we haven't propped up bin Ladden.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, we trained bin Laden and many others like him.  We gave them
<br>
money and weapons in the 80s to fight the Soviets.  We even gave the
<br>
Taliban money as recently as 2001 as part of the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;.
<br>
<p>We've also propped up the corrupt and dictatorial Saudi regime that he
<br>
hates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We haven't propped up Sadaam.  
</em><br>
<p>We did sell him chemical and biological weapons in contravention of
<br>
international law.  We did give him intelligence against the Iranians.
<br>
We did give him permission to invade Kuwait.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As to the King that has taken over in Afghanistan apparently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he was the Afghani's choice in the sense that he was the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only one they would accept.
</em><br>
<p>Actually Afghanistan is administered by an elected president.  There
<br>
wasn't much support for giving the former king a role in the
<br>
government.  Afghanistan is exactly the kind of place we *should*
<br>
support, because it's a young, fragile democracy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Besides the US is always caught between getting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accused of proping up some one on the one hand or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throwing our weight around on the other.  So 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is it?
</em><br>
<p>I think I've been very clear on this.  I think the US should throw
<br>
around its economic and cultural weight to encourage democracy,
<br>
education, human rights, free press, economic growth, and free markets
<br>
around the world.  
<br>
<p>I must be over my posting limit by now, so I'm signing off for the
<br>
day.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
mez
