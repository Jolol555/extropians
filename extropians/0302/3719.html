<br>
<p>==========
<br>
<p>The Golden Age: A Romance of the Far Future by John C. Wright
<br>
New York: Tor, 2002; $24.95 hc; 336 pages
<br>
<p><p>Pastiche? Hommage? Sfumato, perhaps? (That's the Renaissance technique of
<br>
layering paint, so that light gleams through each thickness of oil, like
<br>
echoes of plainchant in a cathedral.) And that's how science fiction
<br>
textuality works now, after a century in which-to change the figure-the
<br>
ground was broken open, aerated, watered, planted, torn up, built upon,
<br>
power lines and sewers added, malled, high-rised, urban renewed,
<br>
solar-celled... Or more exactly, this being the future today (three chairs,
<br>
no waiting), nanoteched, AI'd, lifespan-extended, brain-chipped. Thus, the
<br>
influence of the megatext, that shadowy background infusing everything we
<br>
write and read, enriching our guesses at tomorrow's trajectories, teasing
<br>
us with ironies and missed chances, lending us those vocabularies out of
<br>
which we make these fantastic yet powerfully resilient faux-realities,
<br>
these worlds out of words.
<br>
John C. Wright arrives in our midst apparently from nowhere (aside from a
<br>
few recent short stories), in his mid-forties, with an immensely detailed
<br>
far future romance, instantly fluent in sf's tongues of fire. Well, perhaps
<br>
fluent is putting it a little too strongly. Despite the overheated
<br>
enthusiasm of several early reviewers (`magniloquence', etc), Wright is not
<br>
yet a master of prose; he's often clunky, the thing stomps along manfully
<br>
but fails to dance except in certain especially effective Pre-Raphaelite
<br>
set pieces.  Consider this expository passage:
<br>
<p>&quot;Wheel-of-Life was a Cerebelline ecoperformer of the Decentral Spirit
<br>
School, as well as trustee for all the copyrighted biotechnology based on
<br>
the Five Golden Rings mathematics. She appeared as a matron of serene
<br>
beauty and grave demeanor, seated on a throne of living flowers, grass and
<br>
hedge, in which a dozen species of birds and insects nested.&quot; (p.36)
<br>
<p>It's typical of Wright's method, which is an attempt to create conviction
<br>
by inundation. Such generosity of detail is impressive, even overwhelming;
<br>
it suggests that here we have a writer who (like John Varley) has lain
<br>
awake in agonies of insomnia devising all these wheels within wheels and
<br>
their special designations. But a defter writer might have named some of
<br>
those birds, plants and blooms, picked out their color and scent; Poul
<br>
Anderson, say, would have done so by reflex.
<br>
Yet what Wright does palpably grows from long immersion in the megatext,
<br>
and for all the abundance of wheels there's very little wheel-inventing
<br>
here. A lengthy and useful interview with Nick Gevers, one of the best
<br>
informed of sf's new critics, at <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/05a/jcw127.htm">http://www.sfsite.com/05a/jcw127.htm</a>,
<br>
offers frank witness to his grateful borrowings:
<br>
<p>&quot;A. E. Van Vogt formed my childhood picture of what a hero was. Van Vogt
<br>
portrayed a man who was more sane, more rational, than his foes, was able
<br>
to overcome them. No other writer's works fill me with the sense of awe and
<br>
wonder as does Van Vogt.
<br>
<p>&quot;Jack Vance and Gene Wolfe are masters of style, and I filch from them
<br>
without a twinge of remorse.&quot;
<br>
<p>The clearest influence on Wright's voice, and a welcome one except that he
<br>
can't yet quite carry it off convincingly, is Jack Vance. Here's Wright in
<br>
typically Vancian mocking dialogue:
<br>
<p>`Now we have heard him speak; and our open-mindedness is rewarded; for we
<br>
now learn that [he] believes that what he does is to benefit mankind, and
<br>
to spread our civilization, which he claims to love. A fine discovery! The
<br>
conflict here can be resolved without further ado.' (p. 291)
<br>
<p>Wright introduces his own novelties, but the most conspicuous is a
<br>
regrettable tyro usage that marks disbelieving anger thus: `You blame the
<br>
solar disaster on Helion?!' Tor's copyeditor was either absurdly indulgent
<br>
or asleep at the stick (this jarring solecism recurs throughout, and the
<br>
book is littered with such literals as `where' for `were', not to mention
<br>
`Apha Centauri' and `Bernard's Star'). Will ?! be extirpated from the
<br>
sequel?! I hope so!!!
<br>
Elsewhere, he recalls the impact of van Vogt's sf on him, `the sense of
<br>
wonder that the grand. tradition of space opera embraces. I am trying to
<br>
write a space opera in his style, so I never have a super-starship ten
<br>
kilometers long when a ship one hundred kilometers long will do; I never
<br>
blow up a city when I can blow up a planet.' So Wright is the latest of the
<br>
recent, and ambitious, deep future space opera boom-David Zindell, Steve
<br>
Baxter, Paul McAuley,  Iain M. Banks, Peter Hamilton, Alastair Reynolds,
<br>
Wil McCarthy. As a long-time fan of this mode I rejoiced to read his
<br>
Prologue, `Celebrations of the Immortals', which in about 350 words
<br>
sketches a truly wondrous carnival of beings gathered for the Golden
<br>
Oecumene's millennial High Transcendence. All human and posthuman
<br>
neuroforms are represented, fictional as well as real, high transhumans
<br>
returned briefly to earthly estate from their calculational realms,
<br>
projected future descendants, `languid-eyed lamia from morbid unrealized
<br>
alternatives'. It is a beguiling pageant, an instance of what Paul Witcover
<br>
recently dubbed `posthuman space opera' (NYRSF No. 167).
<br>
In this feverish, abundant, user-pays utopia, foppish Phaethon of
<br>
Rhadamanthus House finds himself inexplicably ill at ease. Before the book
<br>
is done (and it is only the first half of a diptych: The Phoenix Exultant,
<br>
though complete, is not due until next year), this flawed sun god will test
<br>
the very nature of his identity and that of his beloved wife Daphne, a
<br>
natural human and former Warlock of the Cataleptic Oneiromancer School and
<br>
now builder of fantastic VR worlds, of his clone father Helion (another
<br>
solar name, for an engineer who works literally in the bowels of the Sun
<br>
like an escapee from Charles Harness's The Paradox Men), contest with
<br>
artificial minds thousands of times more potent than his own, spar with
<br>
human variants collective and modified, and test his nerve in a puzzling
<br>
challenge that combines the curse of Orpheus with the temptation of Pandora.
<br>
Is this libertarian Golden Age truly one, with all its immense wealth,
<br>
cruelty, absolute responsibility to and for self? (One hardluck case
<br>
complains, to perhaps unintended comic effect, `You are wealthy people. You
<br>
can afford to have emotions. Some of us cannot afford the glands or
<br>
midbrain complexes required.') Or might it be a Golden Cage, penned shut by
<br>
the caution of immortals within a Solar System that can be reshaped (the
<br>
Moon brought closer, Venus relocated farther from the Sun, the Sun's chaos
<br>
itself tamed) but not escaped. There are no aliens in this future, no
<br>
superluminal physics, no time machines, and apparently the single
<br>
extrasolar expedition failed long ago. Who, then, attacks Phaethon with
<br>
such determination, guile and ferocity? Are there alien invaders after all?
<br>
Or perhaps Sophotechs (AIs) gone to the bad, which is to say become as
<br>
self-interested as their charges? Or is Phaethon, like many of sf's
<br>
amnesiac supermen, a terrifying rogue force about to reduce order to ruin
<br>
if his self-inflicted shackles are opened, or carry all into some
<br>
transcendence beyond the year's festive High Transcendence?
<br>
I'll say little more about the plot. The book is on one level a
<br>
travelogue, and Phaethon's misadventures a pretext to display spectacular
<br>
scenery. In this case, though, the spectacle is rarely as simple as a
<br>
catalogue of advanced technology (although there is lots of that, and
<br>
rather nice it is, too), or dazzling settlings (one poor man is obliged to
<br>
trudge downstairs all the way from geosynchronous orbit, compiling his food
<br>
and drink from air and wastes as he descends a space elevator's core, a
<br>
ludicrous but enviably crazed plot move). No, the spectacle shares
<br>
something with the posthuman cognitive explorations of Walter Jon Williams
<br>
(Aristoi) and Greg Egan. Tens of thousands of years hence-Wright says
<br>
millions in an interview, but that can't be right--these people differ in
<br>
mentality as much as in flesh or chip, or so we're told; this is rarely
<br>
enacted satisfactorily, perhaps because it would exceed our capacity to
<br>
grasp, and Wright's to imagine.  Still, it is enchanting to consider the
<br>
segmented and spliced levels of Phaethon's own consciousness, the ways in
<br>
which his inward construction of the world can be tweaked, betrayed,
<br>
filtered, manipulated, clarified, the profusion of people in the Golden
<br>
Age: the Hundred-mind near the kindled star of Jupiter, the gelid frozen
<br>
brains of Neptune with their envious designs for good or ill, the idealized
<br>
computer eidolons of the Aeonite School, Warlock neuroforms with intuitive
<br>
skills derived from non-standard neural links between brain modules,
<br>
Invariants with a unicameral brain immune to filtering and hence dwelling
<br>
within an utterly stark Weltbild-hideously deprived, not unlike our own
<br>
current condition yet perhaps saner. On and on it goes, in a sort of
<br>
extended commentary, from the right, on Olaf Stapledon's classic, minatory,
<br>
marxist Last and First Men: A Story of the Near and Far Future. (Brian
<br>
Aldiss called its successor, Star Maker, the `one great grey book of
<br>
science fiction'.) How successful that argument proves we won't know until
<br>
the sequel is published. For now, the first half of the trip is clearly
<br>
worth taking.
<br>
If all this sounds boringly didactic, though, it's not, just. (Certainly
<br>
it can get weirdly stretched out; Phaethon is asked a question on page 280
<br>
and apparently answers it, instantly, on page 286, with an outburst aimed
<br>
at somebody else in a simultaneous accelerated conversation.) Wright has a
<br>
quirky sense of humor--Wells' Martian pops in for a guest
<br>
appearance--perhaps alarmingly manifested in the names of his own sons,
<br>
Orville and Wilbur. Reading this in his biography, one seriously starts to
<br>
wonder if perhaps he's really a composite invention himself, dreamed up in
<br>
an idle afternoon by Bruce Sterling and some Texan pals. Actually I doubt
<br>
it; Mr. Wright's rather ramrod young fogy sense of propriety--he deplores
<br>
the louche way sf editors and writers freely address each other by their
<br>
first names--lends an eerie patina of conviction. And his characters are
<br>
not wholly given to mighty projects (Phaethon, it's true, unblushingly
<br>
craves `deeds of renown without peer'); one AI likes to manifest as a
<br>
penguin, fishy-breathed but able to fly so fast he leaves a vapor contrail.
<br>
The writer I found myself thinking of quite often-aside from the obvious
<br>
begetters, Stapledon, E. R. Eddison, David Lindsay, Vance (Emphyrio and all
<br>
the rest), Harness, Moorcock (The Dancers at the End of Time), Felix
<br>
Gotschalk (Growing Up in Tier 3000)--was Ian Wallace, a quirky psychologist
<br>
who briefly flared with Croyd (1967), Dr. Orpheus (1968) and several other
<br>
tales of superhuman razzmatazz before fizzling into the backwaters of DAW
<br>
books. That fate is not for Mr. Wright, we can be sure. But I did have one
<br>
jolting thought, at about page 70: Oh, dear God, this is the Ralph 124C41+
<br>
of the early 21st century. It's better written and thought-out than
<br>
Gernsback's dreadful prophetic classic, of course, because it stands on the
<br>
shoulders of giants (as do we all, luckily), nor do I mean to imply that
<br>
Wright has read his scientifictional predecessor.
<br>
In fact, it reminded me more closely of accounts of a lost masterpiece or
<br>
oddity I've never had the chance to read, Curme Gray's Murder in Millennium
<br>
VI (1951). Damon Knight extolled Gray's `audacity and stubbornness', noting
<br>
that while the tale is set thousands of years hence, in a society whose
<br>
customs and technology are utterly unlike ours, `there is not a word in the
<br>
book that might not logically have been written by the narrator for the
<br>
edification of his own posterity' (In Search of Wonder, p. 183). That's
<br>
Campbell and Heinlein's `lived-in future' taken to the ultimate. I felt
<br>
Wright was trying for the same goal, perhaps by similar methods, and was
<br>
pleased to find hidden on his website, among other sf writers' names and
<br>
characters from his book, `curme grayphoenix exultant'. Oddly, Wright
<br>
denies knowledge of the book.
<br>
Similar spookiness (literally) attends the name of one among Phaethon's
<br>
jury of Hortators, guardians of tradition: Casper Halfhuman Tinkersmith of
<br>
the Parliament of Ghosts. `He was a writer of educational matrixes famous
<br>
for his cold logic when he was in his human body, and for his unusually
<br>
vivid passion and drive when he was downloaded into an electrophotonic
<br>
matrix' (pp. 305-6). That should be `uploaded', but doesn't it sound a
<br>
little like the late Dr Paul Linebarger, CIA spook and psychological
<br>
warfare authority, yet hallucinatory creator of the Underpeople and the
<br>
Instrumentality as Cordwainer Smith? A `cordwainer' is a shoemaker, not a
<br>
million miles from the tinker's craft. All this is coincidence, Mr. Wright
<br>
informs me. Ah well. Such are the perils of the megatext.
<br>
What we have then, in The Golden Age, is part of an enormous future
<br>
history that takes for granted many of the narrative devices that are, for
<br>
our time, what rockets, robots and television sets were to sf's golden age.
<br>
What it appears to dodge, although this might be elaborated in the second
<br>
volume, is the ghost at every deep future feast today: the absent
<br>
Singularity. Vernor Vinge gave it a name, this prospect of an absolute
<br>
break with history resulting from runaway exponential growth in certain
<br>
convergent technologies, especially computing and molecular manufacture,
<br>
and we've been trying to tame or dismiss it ever since. A recent
<br>
rec.arts.sf.written thread on Wright's novel even had the telling subject
<br>
line: `Domesticating the Singularity'. You can't, of course. All you can do
<br>
is duck and weave, as Vinge himself, and Banks and Zindell and others (me,
<br>
too) have been doing. In the interstices between the human present, the
<br>
transhuman prospect and the radically posthuman future, there remain
<br>
localities to set superb fiction, as Bruce Sterling showed with Holy Fire.
<br>
Can one leap ahead millennia to the High Transcendence and retell Vance's
<br>
To Live Forever or battle Stapledon ideologically, and get away with it?
<br>
Not really. But then, by definition, the Singularity or Spike stands hidden
<br>
from us by its own appalling upward curve toward infinity, or some
<br>
sublunary approximation. So in the meantime all we can do, perhaps, is
<br>
build as well as we might fables decorated with ingenuity, density, wit,
<br>
sly comedy and, it's to be hoped, some passion. Wright doesn't do half bad
<br>
at that.
