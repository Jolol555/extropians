<p>&lt;&lt;  I am pretty confident that protests and rallies, however persistent, and

<p><p>I also think it will take a good long while for the protester's voices to 
<br>
affect any kind of policy change. It is a very weak part of the modern US 
<br>
version of Democracy... it seems that the will of the governed no longer 
<br>
matters as much as it should. Since we are swathed in burocracy, legalizm, 
<br>
and elitism, it will take (hopefully less than!) a few terms of office to 
<br>
even get enough support in place to even slow down such efforts as put forth 
<br>
by Bush. I hope that something gets done before that and before our rights to 
<br>
affect political change are seriously hampered. It's either that or an 
<br>
eventual revolution among its own citizens to re-vamp the entire way we treat 
<br>
eachother in the 21st century and beyond.
<br>
<p>I can only hope and be positive that we as &quot;the human race&quot; come to our 
<br>
senses soon and stop slaughtering eachother for ridiculous reasons and 
<br>
actually DO something truly positive with all of our collective potential as 
<br>
an entire race! It's time for the world get sophisticated enough to care 
<br>
about where we CAN go if we forget about the bullshit for one minute. 
<br>
Unfortunately there are still waay too many stupid and ignorant people in 
<br>
this world, and waay too many others who are opposed to change for fear that 
<br>
they will lose the only power they have over others.
<br>
<p>I would like to see the complete destruction of dogmatism, both in religion 
<br>
and in politics. Isn't that a big part of what we as Extropians are all 
<br>
about? Faith without logic or reason is our biggest enemy. I think that both 
<br>
our government and the jihadists (among so many others)  are entirely too 
<br>
wrapped up in their own brands of dogmatism, and I personally want no part of 
<br>
either. The only factor of the two that I can control to any extent is my own 
<br>
government. I protest because I want things to change for the better. I 
<br>
protest because there are a hell of a lot of better things to devote our 
<br>
money, resouces, and brains to than slaughter eachother to support their 
<br>
dogmas. I protest because I don't want anyone to DIE because of stupidity on 
<br>
the part of the human race.
<br>
<p>Looking forward to the Spike here,
