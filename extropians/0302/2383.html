Subject: Minimizing energy consumption as a planned community
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I saw an interesting company in Northern Ohio, can't remember the name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right now, but at the same time  they built their new manufacturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facility in a highly rural area, they built a housing development and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apartment complex within eyesight of the plant and opened the housing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only to company employees.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you imagine how much commute time and energy cost is being saved by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people walking, biking, or hopping on the Van shuttle to get to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they installed an underground tunnel between the apartment complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the plant you wouldn't even need to step outside on a snowy day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Has there been any studies on planned communities like this and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; return on investment?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I commuted 1 1/4 hrs each way to work for 4 yrs. And had at least 5 very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close calls on the highway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wasted $100/month on gasoline $360/month auto wear and tear.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above company was very forward thinking.  The government should initiate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some type of tax incentive for companies who do this type of thing!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### Good ideas need no incentives - they are incentives on their own. Ideas
<br>
which need incentives at gunpoint, aren't good, usually.
<br>
<p>(sorry, it's my reflex reaction)
<br>
<p>I think you are right that the idea is cool, except there are a lot of
<br>
people who prefer to commute, rather than cope with a house which is not
<br>
exactly to their liking - and a planned community cannot anticipate all
<br>
personal tastes. If tax incentives artificially lower the price of such
<br>
communities, persons who want a house of their own design are being
<br>
penalized, by having to pay taxes which benefit somebody else.
<br>
<p>The general outcome of tax incentives is a lower standard of living for
<br>
everybody.
