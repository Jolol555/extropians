<em>&gt;  Some of the things he had to say in that piece were interesting, but by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  end (particularly the Nuke DC bit), well, yes, it seems clear that he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  insane.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I hear overheated rhetoric, and read it, all the time. Overwrought, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hyperbolic, &gt;impolitic. It's far from clear to me that he's insane.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. Do you know him? I do. He also spent some years on this list,
<br>
and in my opinion built a solid reputation as one of the sanest voices
<br>
here.
<br>
<p>I didn't find anything to be bothered about regarding Tim's post.
<br>
(in addition to the fact that I agreed with it)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But it's quite clear he's going to be taken for crazy by those who
</em><br>
<p>With the last few words, *maybe* but it's no different than the things
<br>
that Keith Henson says when he is riled up (or me for that matter, but
<br>
I don't swear out loud in as public a manner as Tim does).
<br>
<p>Lighten up you guys.
<br>
