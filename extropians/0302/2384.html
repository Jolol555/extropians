<em>&gt; (Lee Corbin &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20Anniversary%20of%20Roe%20v.%20Wade">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then there is the argument I made that was not addressed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but which was referred to by Ron.  Namely the sincere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    How can we believe that nine men and women sitting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    in Washington can pass laws and rules that apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    equally well to a small tightly-knit Hasidic community
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    on Long Island, to the entire Appalachian South, or to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    communities in southern California?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    (And how can it be maintained that *they* should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    trusted to make this kind of decision, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    communities and states at lower levels cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    so trusted?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To be concrete, suppose that a small Mormon community in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Idaho collectively finds abortion incredibly repulsive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abominable.  What is so heinous about them passing local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws that do not permit doctors to set up business performing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abortions?  It seems to me to be none of our affair anyway.
</em><br>
<p>The argument was addressed repeatedly--you just don't agree
<br>
with it.  The court doesn't &quot;pass laws&quot;, it strikes them down.
<br>
The answer to your example is equally simple: that Mormon
<br>
community /has no rights/, because groups of people don't
<br>
have any rights.  Only individual human beings have rights,
<br>
and when groups try to usurp those rights by passing laws,
<br>
even if they're supported by overwhelming majorities, they
<br>
deserve to be slapped by a court and reminded that the only
<br>
&quot;sovereignty&quot; that matters is individual sovereignty.
<br>
<p>In my less radical moments, I am perhaps willing to concede
<br>
that it makes sense for a larger community to do things like
<br>
set standards of commerce, or regulate behavior /among/ its
<br>
citizens.  But those powers which it makes sense for people
<br>
to delegate to their community (and remember, if governments
<br>
have any power at all it's only because individuals, the source
<br>
of all political power, have delgated it to them) are a very
<br>
limited set, and cannot possibly include personal intimate
<br>
behaviors that are private and individual by their very
<br>
nature.  It makes sense, for example, for a community to have
<br>
laws against assaulting others, driving unsafely on public
<br>
roads, and so on.  It makes no sense at all, and is an affront
<br>
to the ideals of freedom, to have laws against consensual
<br>
private behavior that only affect the participants.  Our
<br>
Supreme Court has been, if anything, far too lax in /not/
<br>
striking down repugnant laws against prostitution, gambling,
<br>
private drug use, and other things that /no/ legislature at
<br>
/any/ level has a right to regulate.
