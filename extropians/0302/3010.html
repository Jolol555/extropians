<p>&quot;This is absurd.  I was a member of Quaker and other groups opposed to the
<br>
war.  We received no funding from anyone except those who volunteered funds,
<br>
needed materials, time and a lot of sweat and heart.  To believe some
<br>
politicized claims at face value and to utterly disbelieve the integrity of
<br>
all those who opposed Vietnam says very poor things about the credibility of
<br>
your statements in this area.&quot;
<br>
<p>Samantha, as I had mentioned before, Todd Gitland, former president of the
<br>
SDS and who is still anti-war, lamented that he regrets that he did not
<br>
notice early enough or do enough to stop the take over of the anti-vietnam
<br>
war protests by communist supporters and sympathizers.  Are you saying that
<br>
Gitland is incorrect?  The the Vietnam protests had no backing or support
<br>
from communist sypmathisers?  Gitland is also appaled that the recent ANSWER
<br>
coalition protest (was that the one you attended?) is run by these same
<br>
people.  The people who founded ANSWER are proudly in support of Ayatollah
<br>
Khomeini, Kim Jong Il, Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein.  
<br>
<p>Tod Gitland's Interview on NPR -
<br>
<a href="http://www.npr.org/ramfiles/fa/20030123.fa.01.ram">http://www.npr.org/ramfiles/fa/20030123.fa.01.ram</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;You are making yourself a laughing stock.&quot;
<br>
<p>You clearly disregard the above mentioned evidence, a statement made by one
<br>
of the spiritual founders of the vietnam anti war protest that the the
<br>
vietnam cause was taken over by pro-communist groups.  Who is being made a
<br>
laughing stock is clearly a subjective element.
