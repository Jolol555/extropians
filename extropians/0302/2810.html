D. Broderick noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Yes, it's just like those awful anti-nuclear marches. All the so-called
<br>
&quot;peace&quot; demonstrators---whose main effect was to increase the likelihood of
<br>
war--helped by their protests (which were greeted in the streets of Moscow
<br>
with the greatest elation) to bring about the ruinous exchange in 1989 when
<br>
the Soviet Union nuked the USA and vice versa.
<br>
Oh no, wait.
<br>
Damien Broderick&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well the Soviet Union had a final crisis of confidence, it would seem, when 1 
<br>
thing happended and and another thing didn't. The first is that it could not 
<br>
psychologically sustain its WW2 type war economy (perhaps 40% of GNP for 
<br>
decades on end) . Secondfly, If the bad guys never attack, then why keep 
<br>
making Kalashnikovs and strella anti-aircraft rockets, in fabulous amounts, 
<br>
as if the Yankee Imperialists are at the gates of Mockba? (cyrillic)
<br>
<p>Iraq, Iran, and North Korea (and the rest) are of a different epoch, each 
<br>
requiring a different response, at different times, in different ways. As 
<br>
your pal, Bruce Sterling noted, &quot;we will need patience, persistance and 
<br>
flexibility to survive.&quot; You do want to survive, don't you? Blink Blink??
