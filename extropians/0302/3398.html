<p><em>            &gt; So, IMO, (1) Mr. Bush will be most grateful for every
</em><br>
<em>            &gt; distraction from  the Iraq desaster to [blah blah]
</em><br>
<p>More motivation theories! I don't give a damn if Bush's true motivation is
<br>
to get Saddam into the Lincoln bedroom in the White House so he can &quot;know&quot;
<br>
him in the biblical sense. I'm not interested in the motivation behind a
<br>
policy I'm only interested in the results of that policy.
<br>
<p><em>       &gt;As I said before, US regimes of the past haven't hesitated to lie
</em><br>
<p>Yes that's true, you have said that before, and a list of past US foreign
<br>
policy mistakes is just as irrelevant now.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;Now we are talking about high-school level  fabrication of
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;chemicals or bio-chemicals in garage-like laboratories. No
</em><br>
<em>   &gt; secret service in the whole western world has any hard
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;facts that this  stuff really exists.
</em><br>
<p>VX is a colorless liquid and the most powerful nerve agent known, one drop
<br>
anywhere on your skin will kill you in minutes.  For years Iraq vehemently
<br>
denied that it had VX or any other nerve gas, but then Gen. Hussein Kamal,
<br>
Saddam's son-in-law defected and told the UN inspectors to go to his chicken
<br>
farm where they found 700,000 pages of secret documents. When confronted
<br>
with irrefutable evidence Iraq said, Oh you mean THAT VX, we misunderstood,
<br>
well ok, we did make a little but not much, just 3.9 tons of the stuff. The
<br>
UN estimates (The UN not Washington!) that they really made between 200 and
<br>
600 tons before 1995, no telling how much they have now. When asked where
<br>
all that VX is Iraq says, oh, we destroyed it all just for the fun of it but
<br>
we forgot to bring any evidence that it actually happened.
<br>
<p>For years Iraq said it had no germ warfare program but then in 1995 another
<br>
defector Gen. Hussein Majid who was in charge of the program went to the
<br>
west. Iraq was forced to change its tune and said, oh, you mean THAT germ
<br>
warfare program, we misunderstood, well ok, we did make a little but not
<br>
much, just 90,000 liters of Botulinium toxin, 8,300 liters of Anthrax, and
<br>
maybe a few other things. Oh, I forgot to mention before that we might have
<br>
weaponized these agents a teeny tiny little bit but not much, just 100 bombs
<br>
with botulinum toxin, 50 with anthrax, and 7 with aflatoxin. Oh, and maybe
<br>
16 missile warheads with botulinum toxin, 5 with anthrax, and 4 with
<br>
aflatoxin but that's all. When asked where all these bio weapons are Iraq
<br>
says, oh, we destroyed it all just for the fun of it but we forgot to bring
<br>
any evidence that it actually happened.
<br>
<p>And you think Iraq is now telling the truth, Kai I have some swamp land I'd
<br>
like to sell you. Very soon it will be as obvious to the man on the street
<br>
as it is already obvious to every intelligence agency in the world that Iraq
<br>
has WMD and is doing everything it can to get more.  I think you and
<br>
Samantha should start reviewing your posts so you can begin dreaming up
<br>
excuses for some very foolish statements.  Well you see, it wasn't as dumb
<br>
as it sounded, uh, when I said they had no WMD what I was trying to say
<br>
[...]
