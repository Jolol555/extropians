<em>&gt;        That sounds like an attractive idea that upon

<p>Although not of the original discussion, I see this
<br>
myth persist in numerous arguments over the falsity of
<br>
beliefs throughout history.  Widely, it's not accepted
<br>
that the majority of people even back as far as
<br>
Columbus or through medieval times believed the Earth
<br>
was flat.  
<br>
<p>here's an excerpt of one article on it: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.mercatormag.com/showissue.phtml?i=45">http://www.mercatormag.com/showissue.phtml?i=45</a>
<br>
<p>another reference to it, starting at the section &quot;A
<br>
Summary of the History of Ideas about Earth's Shape&quot;: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.okbu.edu/academics/natsci/hp/keas/papers/flat_overhead/flat_prelab.htm">http://www.okbu.edu/academics/natsci/hp/keas/papers/flat_overhead/flat_prelab.htm</a>
<br>
<p>here's an excerpt from
<br>
<a href="http://www2.ida.net/graphics/shirtail/preface.htm">http://www2.ida.net/graphics/shirtail/preface.htm</a>
<br>
that goes so far as to even challenge that the church
<br>
believed it.
<br>
<p>&quot;As an example off the top of my head, Umberto Eco’s
<br>
work shows that the Byzantine geographer of the fourth
<br>
century, Cosmas Indicopleustes argued that the cosmos
<br>
was rectangular, and this man has been presented as
<br>
the authority for the Medieval Church thinking for
<br>
centuries that the earth was flat. But Eco shows that
<br>
this is simply not true. Through all the argument, and
<br>
&quot;intricate weaving,&quot; the true light has come out that
<br>
neither Cosmas nor Lactantius (the other authority
<br>
said to be the main thought behind the Church thinking
<br>
the earth was flat) was ever used or known until the
<br>
English publication in 1897! Not only Ptolemy, but
<br>
Eratosthenes, Pythagorus, Parmenides, Eudoxius, Plato,
<br>
Euclid, Aristarchus and Archimedes all knew the earth
<br>
was round. The only ones who didn’t really believe it
<br>
were Leucippius and Democritus.3 Macrobius and even
<br>
Martianus Capella were aware the earth was round.4 Yet
<br>
intricate and elaborate arguings were presented that
<br>
the Church in its superstitious stupidity thought the
<br>
earth was flat! This to show, apparently, that the
<br>
Church was so very unscientific. All the arguing in
<br>
the world won’t demonstrate the earth is flat, nor
<br>
that the ancients thought it was.&quot;
<br>
<p>and so on...lots of google hits, and apparently some
<br>
books these authors list if anyone's so inclined to
<br>
explore this further.
