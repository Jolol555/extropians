<br>
<p>Mez,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My argument is with the conclusions you draw not so much with the 
<br>
numbers themselves.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, they take the salaries of all the servicemen and women they 
<br>
commit to the operation in Afghanistan, then they add in all the equipment 
<br>
and material costs and finally they come up with a number that they report to 
<br>
you.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mez that is in part a BS number.  The question is how much of that 
<br>
cost is strictly attributable to Afghanistan?  My guess is that less than 
<br>
half the total.  But even that is fuzzy.  It is really difficult to figure 
<br>
out exactly what the differential cost is.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you really have to look at a bigger picture.  If going into 
<br>
Afghanistan saved us being hit a 2nd time by the Al Qaeda what is the cost 
<br>
for that relative to the cost of going into Afghanistan?  Would a second 
<br>
strike equivalent to the WTC mean double the cost that we actually suffered 
<br>
from the first strike?  Or would there be a multiplier effect associated with 
<br>
the 2nd strike.  Or would there be a dampening effect?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, get yourself a bottle of aspirin and a pot of coffee before you 
<br>
get a headache.  &lt;G&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real questions we have to be asking now involve the cost of going 
<br>
into Iraq.  What is the cost of not going in if there is a mushroom cloud 
<br>
rising over NYC?  What if we are attacked inside the US with bacteriological 
<br>
weapons supplied by Sadaam?  What is the cost of having Sadaam getting in a 
<br>
snit and bankrolling the Al Qaeda either with money for an attack or with 
<br>
training camps?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have seen the articles on this list giving you the addresses of 
<br>
sites to learn Baysian Statistics.  You can guestimate the probabilities of 
<br>
each event and probably be as close as anyone else.  The hard part is 
<br>
estimating the total cost of each event.  Now try to estimate the human 
<br>
misery involved in each alternative and proceed slowly &amp; carefully 
<br>
recognising that you have a human being on the other side that seems to be 
<br>
trying to out do you so time isn't free.
