<em>&gt; Kai, a couple of comments.  We are getting (a).

<p>I know. Modern cars are lighter and need less fuel. That's what the high 
<br>
taxes (eco-taxes...) in Germany should achieve. Unfortunately, the 
<br>
income of these taxes is not used to improve the engines or the sources 
<br>
for fuels, but for our pension system...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oil (or esp. methane) *could* be both unlimited and sustainable *iff*
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Jepp. We can buy synthetic diesel oil here, made from rapeseed. It's 
<br>
cheaper than fossil oil, but only because the tax on it is lower *sigh*
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That however requires a fair amount of bioengineering.  But it is *not*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unreasonable to expect that it could be accomplished within a decade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if enough resources were devoted to the problem.
</em><br>
<p>Sure. We've produced synthetic fuel in the 30s. There were even cars that 
<br>
drove with wood and straw :-) Not that I'd suggest to rebuild that, but 
<br>
it shows that the technology to get Methane from bio mass is fairly 
<br>
simple and safe. I don't know though, what the most efficient scale for 
<br>
this is with respect to transportation costs, personnel, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One cannot produce enough energy to meet an average individual's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transportation requirements from the surface area of ones home
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *but* I suspect for less than the cost of a few years gasoline
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption one could buy some significant fraction of an acre
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; (such as methane) that your effective energy costs are zero
</em><br>
<p>I've looked for some facts about biomass energy and C4 plants like 
<br>
Miscanthus (china grass). This plant delivers 5-24t/ha in western Europe, 
<br>
depending on soil and nutrients with a heat value of 16MJ/kg (coal 28, 
<br>
brown coal 9, wood 12, straw 15, petroleum 44). That would lead to an 
<br>
&quot;oil equivalent&quot; of 2-8t/ha. This seems to be the best we can get without 
<br>
some intelligent genetic modifications. The good news is, that every 
<br>
other kind of straw and wood can also be used. BTW, maize/corn is also a 
<br>
C4 plant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Europeans should be buying land close to the ocean in North Africa.
</em><br>
<p>There's a cooperation between Spain and Marocco for this. But Methane 
<br>
and H2 pipelines are more expensive than High Voltage DC cables. Don't 
<br>
ask me why, that's what several papers say.
