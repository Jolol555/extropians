<p>Why, I do thank you, Emlyn.  It is definitely a step in the right
<br>
direction to take my posts at face value.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think both Steve and Amara are talking about a more general propensity in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people toward letting fear dominate their thinking, and thus behaviour.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They're not talking specifically about mad survivalism.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, thanks.  This is perhaps something that quite a few of
<br>
us do agree on, after all, even though we approach it differently
<br>
and attend to different symptoms.  In my view, obsession with
<br>
safety surely must have always characterized some subset of the
<br>
bell curve, and the very recent exhibitions of it---at a time
<br>
when truly we as individuals face fewer risks than ever before
<br>
---is simply caused by people not having enough ordinary things
<br>
to worry about.  My mother is perfect example.  She'll find
<br>
something to worry about, up to a level, as if meeting an
<br>
internal need.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem is with a general trend toward a focus on safety and security,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rising from fear, in the west. It comes out in all kinds of funny little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways, like people buying really big stupid cars (because they feel safer),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or people deciding they need guns under their pillows, or even people taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a boring but career oriented job instead of doing what they really want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do with their lives.
</em><br>
<p>You see, I look at exactly the other side of the coin.  To
<br>
some extent I have been guilty of all these examples you
<br>
posit.  Take cars, for example.  After I became a cryonicist,
<br>
I become somewhat more cautious---but not to the degree that
<br>
many cryonicists do.  I began, for another example, to begin
<br>
wearing my seat belt.  Who can really say with any authority
<br>
which risks are worth taking and which are not?
<br>
<p>What we can do is observe general tendencies.
<br>
<p>The remainder of your examples are more typical of those 
<br>
people of your ideological persuasion, whereas, were I
<br>
to detail them, my examples might typify mine.
<br>
<p>To take just one,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And now, we've had the growing example of the mother of all scare campaigns,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning just after September 11 and continuing, with increased frenzy, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the present moment. The War of Terror is a war on a concept...
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you meant &quot;War on Terror?&quot;.  No matter.  From
<br>
the perspective opposite to yours, there are these
<br>
people (who we call &quot;terrorists&quot;) who crash planes
<br>
into buildings, blow up ships, and would probably love
<br>
to detonate an A-bomb in one of our Western cities.
<br>
A lot of other people naturally resent this a great
<br>
deal, and even hate them.  Sounds natural and predictable
<br>
to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a campaign asking us to look out for terrorists in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; midst, and report on them to the government, with the slogan &quot;Be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alert, not alarmed&quot; (which invokes thought processes like &quot;Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alarmed? Why? Is there something I might be alarmed about?  Is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really that bad? Oh shit!&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>True.  But I'm not convinced that this has made people
<br>
be much more fearful than they would anyway.  The day
<br>
after 9-11, children (obviously studying how their parents
<br>
were taking this in) would ask, &quot;Are we going to die?&quot;.
<br>
People overreact to tragedy due to innumeracy, at least
<br>
in the sense that too many really believe they're next.
<br>
Perhaps this is part of what Amara and Steve were criticizing.
<br>
<p>(Many other thoughtful points elided.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is my alternative explanation... some of us disagree fundamentally with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the defacto ideology of the modern west, that being a culture of fear and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative individual obsession with unachievable personal goals like (total)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safety and security.
</em><br>
<p>I had the above explanation for the focus on total safety:
<br>
in a word, because we've never had it so good.  But I would
<br>
characterize the &quot;defacto ideology&quot; of the modern west as
<br>
an emphasis on individual benefit, a respect for property
<br>
(to the rejection of community ownership), and towards 
<br>
secularism.  &quot;Culture of fear&quot;?  When did that start, 
<br>
would you say?  1920?  1960?  1700?
<br>
<p>Thanks for your thoughtful and courteous post.
<br>
<p>Lee
