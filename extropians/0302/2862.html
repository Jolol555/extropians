<p>By Alex Kirby 
<br>
BBC News Online environment correspondent  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A confrontation over nanotechnology could be as bitter as the current debate
<br>
over biotechnology, researchers fear. 
<br>
They say the emerging knowledge has the power to revolutionise society. 
<br>
<p>But its power to exploit the potential of extremely small-scale systems is
<br>
outrunning our capacity to digest its implications. 
<br>
<p>The researchers say the only hope is rapidly to close the gap between the
<br>
science and ethics of nanotechnology. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Go into a British pub and say 'nanotechnology', and nobody knows what
<br>
you're talking about
<br>
<p><p>Dr Peter Singer, JCB
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The warning comes in a study by the Joint Centre for Bioethics (JCB) at the
<br>
University of Toronto, Canada. 
<br>
<p>The study, Mind the Gap: Science and Ethics in Nanotechnology, is published
<br>
in the UK journal Nanotechnology. 
<br>
<p>The cause of the researchers' concern is the process of building working
<br>
devices, systems and materials molecule by molecule, by controlling matter
<br>
measured in billionths of a metre. 
<br>
<p>Small is effective 
<br>
<p>Perhaps more significantly, nanotechnology is about exploiting the unique
<br>
and powerful electrical, physical and chemical properties found at that
<br>
scale. 
<br>
<p>The new science has developed from advances in microscopy, materials
<br>
science, molecular-level manipulation, and the relationship between
<br>
classical and quantum physics. 
<br>
<p>It has already seen single-molecule transistors, an enzyme-powered
<br>
bio-molecular motor with nickel propellers, and a minute carrier able to
<br>
cross from the blood to the brain to deliver chemicals to fight tumours. 
<br>
<p>I don't want the science to slow down - I want the ethics to catch up
<br>
<p><p>Dr Peter Singer, JCB
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Hypothetical advances suggested include cheap, light materials strong enough
<br>
to make space transport economical, and the ability to remove greenhouse
<br>
gases from the atmosphere. 
<br>
<p>Some enthusiasts even claim it may be possible to revive people now in
<br>
suspended animation, though they have little support. 
<br>
<p>The JCB researchers say nanotechnology raises unique questions that may
<br>
require specific regulations. 
<br>
<p>Problem areas include: 
<br>
<p>Equity: who will benefit - just the rich, or the poor as well? 
<br>
Privacy and security: invisible microphones, cameras and tracking devices
<br>
could improve security, and help catch terrorists. What are the military
<br>
applications? 
<br>
Environment: what will the new nano-materials do when they are released? 
<br>
The study says although research is still in its infancy, with most
<br>
applications perhaps years away, &quot;the backlash against the new technology is
<br>
already gathering momentum&quot;. 
<br>
Awful warning 
<br>
<p>Research and development spending on nanotechnology is growing fast - in the
<br>
US up from $432 million in 1997 to $604m by 2002, in Japan from $120m to
<br>
$750m over the same period. 
<br>
<p>Cheaper space travel might be possible 
<br>
The researchers say: &quot;There is a danger of derailing nanotechnology if
<br>
serious study of its ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social
<br>
implications does not reach the speed of progress in the science.&quot; 
<br>
<p>They say they fear &quot;a showdown of the type we saw with genetically-modified
<br>
crops&quot;. 
<br>
<p>One of the authors, Dr Peter Singer, said: &quot;Nanotechnology is going to cause
<br>
a major revolution that will have a profound impact on society. 
<br>
<p>Hope for the poor 
<br>
<p>&quot;Technology promising such massive changes in our lives will be viewed with
<br>
suspicion and perhaps outright fear.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Dr Singer told BBC News Online: &quot;There's a lot of hype around
<br>
nanotechnology, but there's also great potential. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The science is barrelling forward, but the ethics aren't, and there's very
<br>
little public engagement. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Go into a British pub and say 'nanotechnology', and nobody knows what
<br>
you're talking about. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The first step is a fully-informed public - that's the gap we have to
<br>
close, so we can optimise the benefits and minimise the risks,&quot; he said. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The key equity issue is how we can use nanotechnology to help development,
<br>
to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor worlds. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't want the science to slow down. I want the ethics to catch up,&quot; said
<br>
Dr Singer.
