</em><br>
<p>Couldn't agree with Samantha more.  Not long ago was watching a documentary
<br>
about Bayard Rustin (civil rights leader who engineered the whole 1963 March
<br>
on Washington, but about whom not much was written because Rustin was gay in
<br>
a time when being in the closet seemed to be the safest bet).  Among other
<br>
things, the documentary portrayed the original 1955-56 bus boycott in
<br>
Montgomery, Alabama (which eventually resulted in the city's busses taking
<br>
down signs dictating &quot;Negroes go to the back of the bus&quot;).  Although I had
<br>
read about it and seen the bus boycott presented in other documentaries such
<br>
as &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; - I was again taken by the sheet nobleness of the
<br>
boycott.  The word Samantha used (&quot;beautiful&quot;) was exactly the word I used
<br>
in remarking to my husband - &quot;Damn, that was a beautiful thing.&quot;  If Lee
<br>
Corbin ever sees that documentary (originally produced by HBO) and tells me
<br>
he thinks that that bus boycott was &quot;obnoxious&quot; ... I'll eat my firstborn.
