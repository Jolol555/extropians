<em>&gt; &gt; War protestors around the world may be dismayed to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the effect of their efforts on the population of Baghdad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and on Saddam's government.  The news is greeted with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greatest elation by the government and Mr. Hussein.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Meanwhile the people ask, &quot;Is it really true?&quot;, so often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have they been lied to by their government-controlled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; media.  I'm afraid it is, and those who strongly want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be rid of him must be greatly discouraged.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What people anywhere would fail to be elated that their country 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was not to be invaded and large sections of it blown up? 
</em><br>
<p>Those who oppose Saddam and wish for a regime change.  How
<br>
much they *personally* fear the kind of war that'll happen
<br>
must surely vary a lot from person to person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Exactly how is this bad news or something that should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dismay those of us who point out that there is no good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason for this proposed war?
</em><br>
<p>I'm surprised that I should have to spell it out.  But
<br>
that merely shows how each of us finds the viewpoints
<br>
and arguments of others comparatively alien.  You do
<br>
grant the possibility (though I expect you to think
<br>
it somewhat less probable?) that the uniform pressure
<br>
from the armed might of the world might cause him to
<br>
accept one of the deals that is talked about, and just
<br>
abdicate?  Surely if he knew that it was a certainty
<br>
that he was going to be captured by the allies, he 
<br>
would be more likely to choose exile.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So while the effect of the demonstrations on the Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; administration and its allies will be minimal, of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we can expect that any thoughts Saddam Hussein has of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; abdicating or to destroying his WMD are put on hold.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alleged WMD.  We have no proof.  Zero, Nada.  No reason that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stands scrutiny has been given for the carnage and cost, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediate and likely consequent, of this proposed action.
</em><br>
<p>All the news reports and discussions I've seen refer to
<br>
a number of WMD that he had in 1996, and for which he has
<br>
failed to account.  What do you think happened to them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This resembles ever so much the Vietnam debacle a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; generation ago, the main difference being that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; addition to the encouragement and support given to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the murderous Hanoi regime, western politicians were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deeply affected by the demonstrations and protests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as the years went by.  At least this time there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will not follow such tragic consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If western politicians do not heed the cry of the people the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences will be tragic indeed.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, we have you on record as predicting that.   I'll go
<br>
on record as predicting that the deaths of Western soldiers
<br>
will be less than a thousand, and that because of the 
<br>
difficulty that capturing Baghdad poses.  It is said that
<br>
some sectors of the city will be so willing to depose Saddam
<br>
that the first things that arriving troops should do is pass
<br>
out pistols.  Other areas are known to be quite loyal to 
<br>
Hussein.
<br>
<p>As for the deaths of Iraqi soldiers and civilians, as General
<br>
McCafferty (or McCaffrey) said, there's little telling.  It's
<br>
expected that the Allied propaganda leaflets already dropped
<br>
will cause the main Iraqi army units to surrender quickly, but
<br>
that the Republican Guard units will not.  Civilian casualties
<br>
will be almost entirely limited to Baghdad, and will be much
<br>
less than in other wars in which a capital city was conquered
<br>
(e.g. Berlin) because of modern capabilities---no block by
<br>
block, street by street fighting.
