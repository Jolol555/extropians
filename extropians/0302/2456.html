</em><br>
<p>The &quot;sense of self&quot; is certainly NOT an illusion.  The actuality 
<br>
may be a different story or not what we sense that it is.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  One
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness or self-awareness. 
</em><br>
<p>That is a theory.  It is far from proven. We should not blithely 
<br>
assume as being &quot;scientific&quot; what has not been fully validated 
<br>
scientifically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What even most technophiles don't realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that this sense of self is under constant revision, with memories lost,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and sometimes replaced with various degrees of inaccuracy, emotions
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Is a cloud an &quot;illusion&quot;?  Is something that is constantly 
<br>
shifting for that reason &quot;illusion&quot;?  If so, then what does it 
<br>
matter?  Matter itself is consistently shifting at the 
<br>
fundamental level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I find strange is that many people would generally agree with the above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paragraph, but then continue to think that preservation of this illusionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;self&quot; is an all-important goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So it does not matter to you if you die in the next nano-second, 
<br>
heh?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Philosophically-thinking (as opposed to evolutionarily-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-preservation thinking) perhaps we should value and promote the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;extropy&quot; of an individual.  To value the knowledge and processes that lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to greater growth, greater knowledge, greater &quot;intelligence&quot;, with little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regard, indeed perhaps a sense of &quot;good riddance&quot;, to the clinging notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And the difference is what?  Since we don't know yet how to 
<br>
promote the &quot;extropy of an individual&quot; without preserving the 
<br>
current packaging or transferring to future packaging, I am not 
<br>
at all sure that dropping the notion of &quot;self&quot; does anything. 
<br>
Now I do agree that it is quite essential to greatly loosen the 
<br>
notion of &quot;self&quot; if we are going to be able to changing 
<br>
packaging and characteristics radically.  To much baggage 
<br>
defining the view of self is tied to the particulars of the 
<br>
current implementation and its associated evolutionary programming.
