<p><em>&gt; Earth spins counterclockwise or East (looking down from the N pole). The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geostationary lump orbits in the equatorial plane counterclockwise, matching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly. It also might start off (but not necessarily, for angular momentum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons Spike announced) with one face tide-locked to the Earth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine it's a small globe and it starts getting squeezed into an egg/oval
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with long axis normal to the surface; this lengthens until the whole lump is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a huge cable with a double bell-curve cross section. I assume it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progressively forced to precess East until the long axis of the lengthening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; egg is tangent to the Earth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why? Because the lower tip of the egg is moving at 5500 km/hr but while it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remains lower than the core body it's circling the Earth in an orbit where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it only needs to move at 4000 or 3000 km/hr, so it's kicked upwards in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easterly direction. Meanwhile, the upper tip is going too slowly, so it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drags behind to the west.
</em><br>
<p>Good description.
<br>
<p>I suggest considering the force of gravity on the Eastern-most
<br>
(i.e. lower) segment, its present velocity must slow by and by,
<br>
or it will gain the same height as the center of the body at
<br>
geosynchronous orbit. So I see the bottom part presently
<br>
falling into line (between the upper geosynchronous part and the
<br>
center of the Earth).  [But see below]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I first imagined the lower part swinging all the way up and over, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upper part vice versa (except that it's longer, to compensate for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lessened gravity farther from the Earth, which makes matters even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult), and then swinging on, with the rotation slowing but just maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still moving fast enough as it neared the ground to &lt; ahem &gt; tear your head
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off if you incautiously got in its way. :)
</em><br>
<p>We need to be more precise about initial conditions, I'm 
<br>
afraid.  First, a good picture.  If O represents the Earth,
<br>
then the initial state of the small satellite can be rep-
<br>
resented by a period, as in this diagram:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O   .
<br>
<p>The satellite is a LONG way away.  The dynamics get very
<br>
complicated if it begins to extend projections both towards
<br>
the Earth (down or left in the diagram) and towards the 
<br>
moon (up or right).  But let us suppose that we have spun
<br>
up the satellite in the right way as Spike suggested.  Then
<br>
as the arms become longer, it loses angular momentum about
<br>
its center.  I guess that in the last few passes past Earth,
<br>
the lower arm is moving very slowly.  Maybe it could be 
<br>
grabbed as it whips through the atmosphere.
<br>
<p>But note that in this scenario there has been enough time---
<br>
the arms have grown gradually enough---so that they remain
<br>
straight (i.e. are not curved).
<br>
<p>My remarks at the top of this post, as perhaps yours too,
<br>
refer to the scenario where we are presented with a fait
<br>
accompli:  extensions from the satellite already sweep
<br>
down half way to Earth and as far in the other direction,
<br>
and, they have the velocity of the satellite, and there
<br>
is no increase in angular momentum except that which will
<br>
arise as a result of the initial placement.  What will
<br>
happen?  Like you say, a tendency to assume the shape
<br>
of an integral sign will occur, with the lower parts
<br>
attempting to complete a whole orbit sooner than the
<br>
higher parts, because, at first, they all have the same
<br>
velocity.  
<br>
<p>If the extensions are much smaller, maybe I can cope with
<br>
them:  suppose that each arm is just 440 miles long, or
<br>
about a fiftieth of the Earth-Geosynch distance.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O   .
<br>
<p>If the arms are suddenly snapped into place, and they
<br>
start to gradually drift below-East and above-West
<br>
(the former leading and the latter trailing the
<br>
satellite), then you may be right and this would still
<br>
impart so much angular momentum to the satellite that
<br>
it would begin to rotate, arms and all.
