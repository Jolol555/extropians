<p>You are simplifying it too much. It is the state and the process that is 
<br>
intelligence and life. Which should be expressable as mathematics. Well 
<br>
a combination of math and logic at least. Also there need to be some 
<br>
kind of complexity for it to be intelligence.
<br>
<p>The kind of medium that the state and process exists in doesn't matter 
<br>
in principle.
<br>
<p>But please tell 760143 that I actually cannot stand trance music ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without a nice, squishy, brain to become aware of numbers, numbers, in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense, don't exist. Mathematics doesn't exist for a hunting leopard, or for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paramecium, does it?
</em><br>
<p>Any Turing complete machine should be a suitable medium for this. The 
<br>
fact that our mind machine runs inside this squishy mind/nature 
<br>
interface greatly influences the program that it runs. And so gives us a 
<br>
large part of the desires we have.
<br>
<p><p>Oh oh - I feel the need for a definition here. but knowing how this 
<br>
works, somebody has shurely thought of it before me.
<br>
<p>So what is it called, this &quot;machine&quot; that is capable of running an 
<br>
intelligence of human complexity? Something sufficiently complex to both 
<br>
store the state and process of an intelligence that corresponds to a 
<br>
human brain.
<br>
<p>If nothing exist, I will suggest &quot;mbrain&quot;. But then again, that is 
<br>
probably used for something else.
