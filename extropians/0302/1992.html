<p>
New bioethical laws are being formally discussed in France, and will
<br>
be adopted under some form very soon.
<br>
<p>The French Minister for Health, Mr Mattéi, said he would, in agreement
<br>
with the Minister for Justice, Mr Perben, propose &quot;a new
<br>
incrimination&quot; (20 years prison) called &quot;crime against the human
<br>
species&quot;, &quot;aimed at reproductive cloning, and at eugenical practices
<br>
with a goal of organizing the selection of persons&quot;. (Therapeutic
<br>
cloning would be forbidden, too.)
<br>
<p>Two days ago a new step was reached in the propositions, as the Sénat
<br>
formally proposed two more amendments. The first, to penalize (3 years
<br>
prison and 45 000 EUR) &quot;the provocation to reproductive cloning as
<br>
well as propaganda or publicity in favor of cloning&quot;, the second, &quot;to
<br>
reinforce prevention and repression of sectary movements&quot;.
<br>
<p>The idea of the latter is to add propaganda etc. in favor of cloning
<br>
as one reason warranting the civil dissolution of a movement, hence
<br>
considered as sectary.
<br>
<p>If this passes, then, any movement (&quot;suivez mon regard&quot;) that would
<br>
speak about cloning as something to consider, could be considered a
<br>
sect and forcefully dissolved.
<br>
<p>I had a booklet in project about the topic (I am preparing a
<br>
collection of booklets, each one offering food for thought about one
<br>
future-oriented topic); I guess it may, within a few days, become
<br>
illegal to publish it.
<br>
<p>Jacques
