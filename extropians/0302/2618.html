<em>&gt; I think Kai is saying that by driving, you are polluting, polluting

</em><br>
<p>Almost right. Those rules mentioned were not made to save someone against 
<br>
his own will, but to save someone against the stupidity of others. Some 
<br>
smart aleck may think that 30mph within cities is to slow for a freedom 
<br>
loving person like him, ignoring that this rule wasn't made to annoy him, 
<br>
but to protect the others. A society without any such rules would break 
<br>
down soon because of the effort for everyone to protect himself against 
<br>
others and their &quot;freedom&quot;. So, too few (or wrong) rules is bad, too many 
<br>
rules is also bad. A middle course is the answer, not black, not white. 
<br>
But I understand that somehow you love to drive everything to the most 
<br>
absurd extreme.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is the same guy, however, who thinks the possibility of a nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactor killing millions is worse than the 3 million people who die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every year from the pollutants from the combustion of fossil fuels.
</em><br>
<p>I still miss any serious facts that support your claim.
