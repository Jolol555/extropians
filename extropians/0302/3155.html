<p>A very significant stumbling block on the way to the kind of

<br>
<p>That seems to be a common denominator of civilization-failure, or

barbarity-success. It's a plug-in fit for Marxism, Pol Pot, and the

LA Rodney King riots, to name three. I'd lay long odds that it

<br>
Sorry to lump them together, but there you have it.

<p>It's complicated by substantial odds that some of the &lt;x&gt; *are*
<br>
bastards and / or barbarians, or were.
