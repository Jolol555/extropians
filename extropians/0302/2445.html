<em>&gt; Do you think that more than half of the professional

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>What a fascinating question!  I would love to say yes, but I rather suspect 
<br>
not.  What I WOULD say is that if you surveyed the best and the brightest of 
<br>
current cosmologists (leaving aside the question of how you choose them), 
<br>
well over 50% would agree with the statement: &quot;The Big Bang theory, as 
<br>
currently accepted, is inconsistent with one or more observations of the 
<br>
universe&quot;.
<br>
<p>The big problem in the sciences is that scientists are only human. 90% of 
<br>
them are dull-witted sheep. (An observation that seriously rattled me when I 
<br>
first started having dealings with professional scientists.) Of the 
<br>
remainders, the actual innovators, there are always going to be a fair 
<br>
percentage that have a vested interest in the current theory, either because 
<br>
they helped invent it and have gained status thereby, or because they have a 
<br>
grant or other money source tied to particular lines of investigation of the 
<br>
current theory.
<br>
<p>As a result, even in the presense of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, 
<br>
an old theory keeps going until the number of dissenting voices reaches some 
<br>
critical mass, after which the global scientific perspective changes, almost 
<br>
overnight.
<br>
<p>This makes such questions as &quot;would 20% of scientists agree...&quot; a poor 
<br>
measurment of theory credibility, since (most) scientists do not 
<br>
independantly hold opinions, but do so in consensus.
