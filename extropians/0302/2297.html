<p><p>I think we'd have to accept that if we resurrect primates or dolphins we
<br>
will
<br>
have to alter them neurologically to boost their intelligence, using
<br>
human/AI
<br>
models (which are the only models we will have to develope from, assuming we
<br>
are alone).
<br>
<p>I would certainly be in favour of dogs and cats and dolphins. Numbers in the
<br>
past
<br>
are not a problem. Under Tipler's scheme, this all occurs in an infinite
<br>
multiverse
<br>
stack, so space is not a problem at all there. The intervening time however
<br>
is a problem
<br>
under Tipler's scheme if human populatin doubles every year (if every human
<br>
female gets
<br>
pregnant every year). If other spcies are boosted soon, this is also a
<br>
problem for them.
<br>
<p>Under Tipler's scenario, it may be that birthing children may need to be
<br>
restricted to certain
<br>
intervals.
<br>
<p>I don't have any problem resurrecting Genghis Khan (Oceanic Lord) but I want
<br>
to have a
<br>
system of protective shielding (provided with consent) in place, along with
<br>
positive ethical
<br>
notions relating to inbuilding free will in newborns, assistance, choice
<br>
etc..
<br>
<p>Genghis may well be in a difficult position because he has to live with
<br>
himself and a lot of
<br>
social stigma. Or he may not. As long as he is not free to rape and pillage
<br>
without consent, I
<br>
have no problem with his existence. Just because I can forgive him
<br>
absolutely and love him
<br>
to an extent does not mean that I need ever agree with what Genghis Khan did
<br>
in the past.
<br>
<p>Iain Bank's Culture series can provide a few pointers on a littel of the
<br>
above. I agree with
<br>
Iain's vision of no work for anyone in the previous/current sense, a vision
<br>
shared with
<br>
Greg Egan and many other sf writers.
