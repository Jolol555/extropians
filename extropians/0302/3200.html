Me:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  all you fine young
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  cannibals feel pretty relaxed because you  have done the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  thing. That's why you appear to be the nicer people.
</em><br>
<p>Brett:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sounds a little piqued Hubert, I mean no criticism by this as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that's natural enough given the topic and the strong feelings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many people have of it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, with that &quot;piqued&quot; statement I had already disciplined myself from
<br>
using stronger words and images. Calling war supporters the &quot;nicer&quot; people,
<br>
is selfrighteous kindergarten level and cries for an answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But I am interested in your suggestion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there might be an evolutionary and neurological bias towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling good about supporting a decision to engage in conflict.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am sceptical myself that this is likely to be a significant bias but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you saying is not obviously impossible (at least to me) do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have an data or research to support your view?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not an expert in evolutionary biology but it seems obvious that Homo
<br>
sapiens has more than one brain. The older stacks, sometimes referred to as
<br>
&quot;reptile brain&quot;, regulate your alertness when  your personal territory seems
<br>
to be attacked. Piss off you sonofabitch or I smash your bloody....(insert
<br>
whatever you want to have smashed on your enemy who actually might be a poor
<br>
and weak relative who wanted to ask you for some food) The slightest
<br>
threatening is answered by tightly wired behaviour with almost no options
<br>
left. You have to defend your little front garden, bark as loud as you can
<br>
and prevent the people from across the road to pee at the lamp post, where
<br>
your garden fence ends. This is a very powerful ancient evolutionary
<br>
program. Difficult to overcome.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For my part I wonder sometimes if my atheism which I think is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a position I've arrived at intellectually rather than emotionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may bias my perceptions more towards being willing to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hawkish when the circumstances require it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I grew up in a Christian tradition (Roman Catholic secondary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school and all) and went through the stages of agnostic to atheist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my mid to late teens. ......
</em><br>
<p>I grew up with the very same mind set and became an atheist in my late
<br>
teens. But it was in post war Germany, so I aquired the memes of my
<br>
generation (I was born 1954) that no country should engage in a war anymore
<br>
except when it is attacked. In that case, of course it is justified to
<br>
defend your life and I would probably learn to use a gun very quickly. And I
<br>
know that some contemporary Christian think tanks (yes, the DO have some :-)
<br>
are finally talking about a &quot;just peace&quot; - in the case of Iraq - instead of
<br>
a &quot;just war&quot; or a holy war, which had been a Christian dogma through the
<br>
ages. There is a congregation (?) in Rome, forgot its name. They were
<br>
already nominated for the Peace Nobel Prize. Maybe one of our Italian
<br>
friends knows who I am talking about.
<br>
<p>Anyway, coming back to the topic: The USA are NOT attacked by Saddam, so
<br>
they have no bloody right to invade his country and piss at his garden
<br>
fence with a GPS penis. It is a crime and Troubleyou Bush will be a criminal
<br>
if he does so. This is the democratic point of view. The momentary Bush
<br>
doctrine is an imperialistic stance which scares the rest of the world,
<br>
because it shows a tendency to drift away from democratic principles.
