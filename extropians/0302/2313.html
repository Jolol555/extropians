Here is more evidence of neuroprotection by selegiline/deprenyl:
<br>
<p>This is evidence that selegiline protects neurons from death due to from
<br>
temporary lack of oxygen (hypoxia) as in stroke (ischemia).
<br>
<p>ABSTRACT
<br>
L-deprenyl reduces brain damage in rats exposed to transient
<br>
hypoxia-ischemia.

<br>
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: L-Deprenyl (Selegiline) protects animal brains
<br>
against toxic substances such as 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and
<br>
6-hydroxydopamine. Experiments were conducted to test whether L-deprenyl
<br>
prevents or reduces cerebral damage in a transient hypoxia/ischemia rat
<br>
model. METHODS: Rats were treated for 14 days with 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg
<br>
L-deprenyl or saline. After surgery a 20-minute hypoxia/ischemia period was
<br>
induced by simultaneous occlusion of the left common carotid artery and
<br>
reduction of the percentage of oxygen in the gas mixture to 10%. Rats were
<br>
killed 24 hours later. Silver staining was used to reveal damage in several
<br>
brain regions. RESULTS: In the brain, both L-deprenyl dosages reduced damage
<br>
up to 78% compared with the controls. Total brain damage was decreased from
<br>
23%-31% to 5%-9% with the L-deprenyl treatment (2 mg/kg: F1.13 = 6.956, P &lt;
<br>
.05; 10 mg/kg: F1.13 = 5.731, P &lt; .05). In the striatum, significant
<br>
treatment effects were found between both the L-deprenyl groups (2 mg/kg and
<br>
10 mg/kg, respectively) and the saline group (F1.13 = 14.870, P &lt; .005; and
<br>
F1.13 = 8.937, P = .01; respectively). In the thalamus, significant
<br>
treatment effects were seen in the 2-mg/kg L-deprenyl group (F1.13 = 11.638,
<br>
P &lt; .005) and the 10-mg/kg group (F1.13 = 8.347, P &lt; .05) compared with the
<br>
control group. No significant damage decrease was seen in the hippocampus
<br>
and the cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that L-deprenyl is effective
<br>
as a prophylactic treatment for brain tissue when it is administered before
<br>
hypoxia/ischemia. Mechanisms responsible for the observed protection remain
<br>
unclear. The regional differences in damage, however, are in accordance with
<br>
the reported regional increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase
<br>
activities after L-deprenyl treatment, suggesting the involvement of free
<br>
radicals and scavenger enzymes.
