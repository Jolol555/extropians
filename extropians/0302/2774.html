<em>&gt;&gt; Weapons of mass destruction change everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In space, the scale of mass destruction grows
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; without bound.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No it doesn't.  There are &quot;effective&quot; limits on everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even the most energetic events in space such as stellar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collisions or gamma ray bursts have effective ranges.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they didn't we would have been wiped out long ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See the Nov. 2002 issue of Scientific American, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article &quot;When Stars Collide&quot; for further discussion.
</em><br>
<p>I believe Dennis got caught up in his own hyperbole here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; In space, the family truckster could be a kinetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; energy WoMD by its very nature.  The power plant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to run farms could  be a dual use producer of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fissionable materials for atomic weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand where you are obtaining the energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from.  It sounds like you are planning on breeding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements lighter than uranium into uranium or other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher MW elements that are capable of fission.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most readily available power sources for this are light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy from a star (fusion) and local fusion reactors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This seems like it will be a very inefficient process.
</em><br>
<p>I can't speak for Dennis here, but it sounds like you're sticking a
<br>
little too close to his example.  I do think as any civilization spreads
<br>
out into space, it's weaponry will become more powerful.  I think many
<br>
items will have dual use -- whatever they are.  On this list, e.g., not
<br>
a few people are afraid of nanotech being used to make weapons or as
<br>
weapons.
<br>
<p>Elsewhere, too, you mention GRBs and such.  For an advanced enough
<br>
civilization, could these not be part of its arsenal?  It mgiht require
<br>
planning and a lot of stealth or perhaps such a civilization might use
<br>
them years before its victims were advanced enough to detect and figure
<br>
out what was going on.  (Certainly would make a good science fiction
<br>
story.  I'm not so sure it's valid though.  I'm only trying to play out
<br>
Dennis' view for all its worth.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Mining equipment could steer a large rock down a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; gravitational well and destroy whole civilizations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not any &quot;intelligent&quot; civilization.  An intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization where individuals seek to live indefinitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to adopt a form of a distributed replicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>This depends on it being possible.  If it's possible, then it would be a
<br>
good way to go.  However, this still leaves an out for Dennis' model
<br>
here.  This is that civilizations get the hyperdestructive and
<br>
space-faring capabilities long before they become &quot;intelligent.&quot;  If
<br>
this is the path most civilizations take, then Dennis might have a good
<br>
model.
<br>
<p>Also, there could be some path dependence in here.  What I mean is
<br>
certain developmental paths foreclose others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I pointed this out at the Extro 3 conference in 1997).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This thought vector subsequently led to the design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilizations spanning solar system sized scales
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (e.g. Matrioshka Brains).  The size limits for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Matrioshka Brain civilizations powered by sol type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (G) stars are around 3 light years in diameter.  Hurling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an asteroid or a comet at such a civilization isn't going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dent its capacities even slightly, though it might annoy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it (which is probably *not* a good idea).
</em><br>
<p>I agree, though the problem is why haven't we spotted any M-brains or
<br>
the like?
<br>
<p>Also, it would seem from Dennis' point of view, supercivilizations might
<br>
still see lower civilizations as potential threats.  Why wait until they
<br>
become dangerous or rivalrous?  If that's the case, then Dennis'
<br>
strategy is not so bad.  Hide and don't take any chances.  (Too late for
<br>
Earth, though, since we've been broadcasting our location for about a
<br>
century now.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; How can space tyrants disarm a populace when dual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; use includes WoMD capabilities?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is still thinking too much along the lines of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primitive human space travel.  Things are quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different when one takes ones entire star system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the journey.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is because he was thinking along the lines of human
<br>
development here.  The point will still apply to larger civilizations.
<br>
I mean would there be tyranny among M-brains?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The next question is how to defend against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; individuals and terror groups wielding these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; same common industrial WoMD.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Easy -- distributed, replicated intelligence.  The actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of individuals or terror groups is pointless if they cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroy &quot;all&quot; of you.  All they do by injuring part of you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is annoy you.  And as Khan observed, &quot;Revenge is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dish best served cold&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>You have to get there first.  Such a group existing now would not have
<br>
to worry about this.  Until we have that, then there's always the
<br>
possibility of WoMD attacks wiping out the only intelligences we know.
<br>
Future WoMD will no doubt be even stronger requiring more
<br>
countermeasures.  For example, even &quot;distributed, replicated
<br>
intelligence&quot; can be detroyed if you destroy all the copies.  Imagine,
<br>
if you will, that we come by this sort of technology -- to make
<br>
&quot;distributed, replicated intelligence&quot; -- tomorrow morning, but some
<br>
alien race hits Earth with a nice sized asteroid, one that would
<br>
basically vaporize the crust.  It doesn't matter how many copies you
<br>
made of yourself if they're all on Earth.  (Also, even if you put copies
<br>
in safe storage on a satellite, without the technology for them to do
<br>
anything, they might as well be dental records.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It has to change the arrangement of human societies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Aliens will have the same problem - hence my solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to the Fermi Paradox - only those who hide live in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the long run.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps true &quot;in the long run&quot;.  But the universe has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not reached the point where there are resource shortages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would tend to promote interstellar warfare.  For now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are lots of resources to supply the development of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple advanced civilizations.
</em><br>
<p>Several months ago on the Starship_Forum list [see
<br>
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Starship_Forum/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Starship_Forum/</a>] Dennis mentioned that he
<br>
thought the reason for competition would be obvious here.  Any other
<br>
species would tend to spread exponentially.  It might even become more
<br>
advanced more quickly.  This would set up the potential for conflict in
<br>
the future.  Why leave it to chance?  Also, it might be unlikely any two
<br>
civilizations would understand each others' motives.  I don't
<br>
necessarily buy this, but imagine the case where only n% of
<br>
civilizations are hyperaggressive.  The other (100-n)% would still have
<br>
to take them into account and this might shape the whole way
<br>
civilizations deal with each other on a universal scale.
<br>
<p>Now, this all relies on an extended analogy with human foreign
<br>
relations.  I don't know how far it can be pushed, but I don't think
<br>
it's unquestionably wrong.  No doubt, if humans move out into space,
<br>
some of this might play out in the solar system.  However, I tend to
<br>
side more with Robert here once you have the technology to upload and
<br>
distribute.  We shall, I hope, see.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
