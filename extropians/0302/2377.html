<br>
such individual rights really can be read into the US constitution is another 
<br>
thing. Assuming this is legitimate, however, a body such as a Supreme Court 
<br>
is the appropriate institution to protect them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to reasonable to speculate that anytime we contend that we 
<br>
have reserved a power to ourselves without defining what the power is then 
<br>
someday when we go to exercise our power there will be differences of opinion 
<br>
as to whether the power ever existed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were presented the proof, in class, that we had always 
<br>
exercised the right to abortion under the old English Common Law and under 
<br>
American legal practice there seemed to be a lot of indications that were pro 
<br>
abortion but that the facts were not perfectly clear.  In the end it was a 
<br>
judgement call.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I remember it, way back in 1974 or 75 I argued pro abortion but in 
<br>
weighing the facts and making a judgement it was a squeaker IMHO.
