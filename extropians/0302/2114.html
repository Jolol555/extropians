<em>&gt; Global warming until proven is just a theory.
</em><br>
<p>From what I've read about it until now, the heat and the waste (CO2, NOx, 
<br>
FCHCs) of our civilization seems to increase the energetic level of the 
<br>
global climate. While the long term effect may be another stable state, 
<br>
the short term effect seems to be increased instability and local peak 
<br>
events like devastating thunder storms, hurricans, floods, etc., 
<br>
destroying a lot of land.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if we are accelerating the warming effect, it will still happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over a long long period of time allowing us to perfect alternate energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources as fossil fuels become scarcer and more expensive!
</em><br>
<p>That's not so clear. Many factors of the climate equation contain a 
<br>
buffering element, for example to store CO2, bind NOx or decompose toxic 
<br>
waste. The oceans, forests and large mountains are known for this. 
<br>
Systems like that work up to a certain point and then suddenly tilt and 
<br>
collapse like a lake that dies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps some areas will be intolerably hot but areas like the continent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the arctic may become habitable!  As temperatures slowly increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people will migrate to more desirable climates.
</em><br>
<p>Such large scale migrations - not from Nevada to Wyoming, but from Africa 
<br>
to Europe, from Middle/South America through the USA - will probably 
<br>
produce a lot of wars for resources and against the emigrants rsp. those 
<br>
who are defending their soil. This could be a substancial threat to our 
<br>
civilization.
