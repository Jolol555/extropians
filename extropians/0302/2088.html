<p>
Max,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how big an archive you have or if you can go back and 
<br>
reread what has been said for the past two or three months.  But, my 
<br>
impression is that you (plural) are not complaining about there being 
<br>
political expression on the Extropy list, you are complaining that when you 
<br>
express yourself politically there are those that refute 
<br>
_------_------
<br>
<p>Refute is such a strong word: To prove to be false or erroneous; overthrow
<br>
by argument or proof.
<br>
Most of what I see on this list I consider to be dogmatic posturing which is
<br>
in my opinion a far way off from the strength of logical proof or otherwise
<br>
unassailable truth (to the extent there is such a thing). 
<br>
So many apply the term reasonable to themselves but how many remember what
<br>
reasonable actually means?  Let's get back to the skeptical traditions of
<br>
Hume and make sure we are applying our reasonableness to ourselves.  Given
<br>
Hume, Wittgenstein, Quine, Godel and so many others how can we say that the
<br>
ephemera of our minds is necessarily truth?  I would at least hope that we
<br>
would describe our beliefs as hypothesis instead of truth - I think it would
<br>
bring the tone of debate to a more rational/sustainable place as well as
<br>
being in greater agreement with what appear to be the philosophical and
<br>
physical realities of our existence.  
<br>
I would like to see these debates take a more subtle, more academic format.
<br>
How is this achievable? I have a couple of suggestions.  
<br>
Most arguments have identifiable points of dispute.  These points should be
<br>
identified and polls should be taken.  Polls can be easily made via yahoo or
<br>
other sources.  As the debate continues evidence will be gathered and given
<br>
for all sides of argument.  The evidence should have it's own polling system
<br>
so that as the debate evolves each bit of evidence will either be accepted
<br>
by the community or rejected and from here an overall consensus can be
<br>
built.  A new format of discourse may be useful - could the wiki idea come
<br>
into play here - a web forum place where the polling results would be
<br>
associated and accessible from the individual forum threads.  
<br>
The current process just seems like wheel spinning at a point in time when
<br>
there is so much important work to be done.  We need points of action not
<br>
just points of debate.  
<br>
<p><p>Chris Camp
