<p><em>&gt; I've concluded that your opposition to protests is aesthetic. Which is fine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I respect that.  Just like I have an aesthetic opposition to eating meat,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smoking pot, crossdressing, or drinking alcohol (though I invariably stick up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the carnivores, potheads, transies, and drunks when some goody-two-shoes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moralist opens their big mouth [agree!].)
</em><br>
<p>Well, no!  I object to their *demonstrating*.  They aren't following
<br>
the Golden Rule, sort of.  They are violating Kant's Categorical 
<br>
Imperative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You basically don't seem to be denying that people have a right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to *peaceably* assemble.
</em><br>
<p>When I think of *assembling*, I think of people meeting in their
<br>
homes or in rented auditoriums---not taking to the street in 
<br>
symbolic violence, and certainly not disrupting traffic and
<br>
creating disturbances.
<br>
<p>But I certainly agree that they should have a legal right to
<br>
do so, provided that they get a permit to &quot;march&quot;, which
<br>
should mean that they cannot do it if the police deem it
<br>
to be too much of a public disturbance (and give sufficient
<br>
reasons for their judgment).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By the way, what do you think of more creative forms of protest?  Such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; registering a domain name that sounds like the bad guys (whoever your bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guys happen to be) and directing it to a site that makes fun of them (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even pretends to be them and says outrageous things on their behalf)?
</em><br>
<p>I'd shy away from making a general prescription about this for two
<br>
reasons.  The first is that it would depend too much on the particulars,
<br>
perhaps such as whether they were costing their target money, whether
<br>
it was done in poor taste, and whether it was just a dirty trick.
<br>
The second, however, is that I'm getting more and more fond of humor,
<br>
and more often see satire and ridicule as deserved on their own merits!  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or patenting/copyrighting something crucial to the bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guys' plan (which through some oversight they forgot to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nail down) and then prohibiting them from using it?
</em><br>
<p>I would say that this too would depend too much on circumstances.
<br>
For example, what might seem unethical might simply mean that
<br>
the originators of the patenting needed to have better lawyers.
<br>
On the other hand, I will complain as much as anyone when some
<br>
people do this---but obviously, we can hardly outlaw it.
<br>
<p>Lee
