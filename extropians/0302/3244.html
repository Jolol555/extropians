<a href="mailto:oregan.emlyn@healthsolve.com.au?Subject=Re:%20Inability%20to%20see%20the%20enemy%20(was%20RE:%20IRAQ%20sort%20of:%20%20Re:%20Tim%20Ma%20y%20calls%20for...">oregan.emlyn@healthsolve.com.au</a> writes: There are a number of people in this 
<br>
debate who pretend to be undecided about the issue, but clearly are pro-war. 
<br>
For the record, I'm extremely anti-war (hopefully that's not news).  Apart 
<br>
from anything else, Australia has been involved in far too many wars of 
<br>
dubious merit (actually, downright stupid is probably the best descriptor - 
<br>
gallipoli, vietnam, boer war?  probably lots of others but I'm no war buff).
<br>
<p>Emlyn are they pro war or pro survival?  Seriously, this country was hit 
<br>
first by the Al Qaeda.  Now it sees a man that has hit them personally in the 
<br>
past, as well as others, looking for the weapons to hit them again.  So they 
<br>
have decided to hit him first.  Is that so illogical?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people being equally pro survival have clearly decided the way 
<br>
to survive by hunkering down and acting like they are anti war.  This way 
<br>
when the mad man runs amok he will tangle with the hawks who do the fighting 
<br>
and the hunkered down dove won't even get noticed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning the Washington Post was supposed to have run an article 
<br>
summarizing the encouragement the doves were giving to Sadaam Hussein.  
<br>
Supposedly he is feeling much better about his situation because he has 
<br>
friends that will attempt to protect him.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't been able to see today's Post -- is the report I have 
<br>
received correct?
<br>
