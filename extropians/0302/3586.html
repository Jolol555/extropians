R. Coyote suggests
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ascertain and apply whatever degree of preparedness you can practically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve without disruption of your life, and then get over it.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, so I did hear one talk show host that I respect say in a
<br>
response to a listener that one ought to have an emergency 
<br>
cache of supplies, like drinking water and a little food.  But
<br>
he quite sensibly pointed out that (as we live in California)
<br>
you want to do that out of ordinary prudence anyway (earthquakes).
<br>
<p>Now I was only thirteen or so at the time of the Cuban Missile
<br>
crisis, and we routinely thought that there very likely would
<br>
be atomic war.  Wars had taken place every twenty years or so,
<br>
and it just seemed due.  So of course all the kids knew how to
<br>
take quick shelter if a bright light suddenly appeared in the
<br>
sky somewhere, and then, if you got quickly inside your house,
<br>
open all the doors to minimize the effects of the shock wave.
<br>
If you and your house survived this, then go close all the
<br>
windows to block the radiation.
<br>
<p>We lived 12 miles away from a very large Air Force base, and
<br>
knew that in case of war we'd either be instantly dead, or
<br>
have a rather small chance of living.  Twelve miles away from
<br>
a megatonnage weapon was pretty iffy.  And then, what if the
<br>
Russians missed, and it came closer  :-(
<br>
<p>But none of the kids seemed very perturbed or badly affected,
<br>
and I don't recall that there was a lot of anxiety about it.
<br>
Some people built bomb shelters, but I didn't know any.
<br>
<p>So I guess that I have to agree with R. Coyote's advice:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ascertain and apply whatever degree of preparedness you can practically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve without disruption of your life, and then get over it.
</em><br>
<p>and with Amara and Steve:  if you are noticing signs of anxiousness
<br>
or find yourself dwelling at length unpleasantly about disasters,
<br>
then, yes, get over it.
<br>
<p>But let me know first.  As I say, I'm just not in the loop about all
<br>
this, evidently.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
