<em>&gt; (Kai M. Becker &lt;<a href="mailto:kmb@kai-m-becker.de?Subject=Re:%20Hydrogen%20as%20SCAM?">kmb@kai-m-becker.de</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) AFAIK, coal is not suitable for deadly weapons and therefore of no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value for villains of any kind, including &quot;corrupt despotic theocratic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderous regimes&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>That's probably true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (2) Coal is almost no hazard for human health, except when swallowed or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hit on the head and therefore doesn't have to be kept safe and secured 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all times.
</em><br>
<p>That's not true.  Burning coal pollutes air horribly, and not just
<br>
a few greenhouse gases, but really toxic stuff including Uranium
<br>
and Thorium.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (3) The by-products of coal mining can be put back without any hazard 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the biosphere.
</em><br>
<p>Also false.  Uranium is a byproduct of coal mining, and becomes
<br>
concentrated when removed.  Putting it back that way is unsafe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (4) Coal ashes is not dangerous and does not need to be kept off our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biosphere for thousands of years.
</em><br>
<p>Mostly true, though coal tar is rather nasty stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (5) Even a very large malfunction in a coal fired power plant could not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devastate a large area, cost millions of lives and billions of Euros 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (please read about the effects of Tschernobyl '86 in FSU and Europe).
</em><br>
<p>That's mostly true.  Coal burning kills millions of people slowly,
<br>
not all at once.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (6) An exploding LNG tanker may have the mechanical power of a small 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A-bomb, but it will not make the whole area uninhabitable for years. BTW, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what would you prefer as a terrorist attack, an oil tanker rammed into a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  harbour at full speed, or an atomic bomb on the same area?
</em><br>
<p>That's fair.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All this results in much higher costs for nuclear power systems.
</em><br>
<p>That's a fair assessment too, but I think the relative costs are
<br>
often exaggerated by ignoring the substantial costs of burning
<br>
fossil fuels.  Overall, taking all risks into account, nuclear
<br>
power still comes out a winner by a /large/ margin.
