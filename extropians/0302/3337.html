<p>To which Sean Kenny responded:
<br>
<p>&quot;Iran, 1953: When the government of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh 
<br>
nationalized the Anglo-Iranian oil company, the resulting sanctions on 
<br>
the country – led by Great Britain and the United States – resulted in 
<br>
economic hardship and political unrest. Fearing that such instability 
<br>
could result in a communist takeover and concerned about the precedent 
<br>
of nationalization on American oil companies elsewhere in the Middle 
<br>
East, agents of the Central Intelligence Agency organized a military 
<br>
coup in 1953, ousting the elected prime minister. The United States 
<br>
returned the exiled Shah to Iran, where he ruled with an iron fist for 
<br>
more than a quarter century. Tens of thousands of dissidents were 
<br>
tortured and murdered by his dreaded SAVAK secret police, organized and 
<br>
trained by the United States. The repression was largely successful in 
<br>
wiping out the democratic opposition. The SAVAK was less successful in 
<br>
infiltrating religious institutions, however, so when the revolution 
<br>
finally took place, toppling the Shah in 1979, the formerly secular Iran 
<br>
came under the leadership of virulently reactionary and anti-American 
<br>
Islamists. The result of the Islamic revolution was not only the end of 
<br>
one of America’s strongest economic and strategic relationships in the 
<br>
Middle East, but also the hostage crisis of 1979-81, Iranian support for 
<br>
anti-American terrorist groups, and a series of armed engagements in the 
<br>
Persian Gulf during the 1980s. Had the United States not overthrown 
<br>
Iran’s constitutional government in 1953 and replaced it with the 
<br>
dictatorial Shah, there would not have been the Islamic Revolution and 
<br>
its bloody aftermath.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am appreciative of your response, Sean, but I disagree completely 
<br>
with it. If we wish to continue the rotating game of assigning blame, then I 
<br>
could then say this. Had not Islamic fanatics of the terrorist organization 
<br>
Fedaiyan-e Islam (Devotees of Islam) assassinated then Iranian Prime Minister 
<br>
Ali Razmara in 1951, Mohammed Mossadegh would never have been appointed Prime 
<br>
Minister in Iran (by the Shah, who you heavily criticize, a point I will 
<br>
address shortly). Razmara staunchly opposed nationalization of the oil 
<br>
companies on the grounds that Iran should abide by its international 
<br>
agreements and because he felt they could not run the oil fields alone.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A continued Razmara administration then would not have nationalized 
<br>
the oil fields, the sanctions you speak of would never have occurred, and a 
<br>
pro-western regime endorsed by the Western powers would have been continually 
<br>
aided and supported Iran for the foreseeable future. Therefore, not only are 
<br>
the Islamic fundamentalists to blame for the chaos in Iran in 1978-79, they 
<br>
are also to blame for the difficulties which occurred in the 1950's.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say now that I am partly to blame for this game of &quot;Who did 
<br>
what&quot; oneupsmanship. In responding to Mez originally, as is seen above, I 
<br>
responded more forcefully than perhaps what was appropriate. I took strong 
<br>
issue with his apparent claims that US foreign policy during the Cold War was 
<br>
somehow intentionally anti-democracy. In my subsequent discussions with Mez 
<br>
we were able to clarify and elaborate on our positions. Though I did not 
<br>
agree completely with him, I found him to be a fair, thoughtful, and 
<br>
intelligent poster. But, given my initial reaction, I am not surprised that 
<br>
Sean replied in the manner in which he did. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having addressed the hyperbole on both sides, I would like now to 
<br>
address my main concern with Sean's post. As I commented to Mez, I cannot 
<br>
abide judgments passed on US foreign policy that make it appear these 
<br>
decisions were being made in a vacuum. To &quot;describe&quot; the US-Iranian 
<br>
relationship during the Cold War without once mentioning the Soviet Union, as 
<br>
Sean does, is to simply ignore reality. I find it even more unfortunate that 
<br>
he did not in his rebuttal address my point, which was that the abdication of 
<br>
the Shah played a direct role in the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. 
<br>
It is simply not realistic to suggest otherwise. The transformation of Iran 
<br>
from a pro-western nation with US bases to a nation completely hostile to it 
<br>
had a profound impact on Soviet thinking. All one need do is look at a map of 
<br>
the region.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I will acknowledge that the question of whether or 
<br>
not the United States and Great Britain should have removed the regime of 
<br>
Mohammed Mossadegh is one that can be debated. However, let us not make that 
<br>
regime into something it was not. Mossadegh did have some &quot;liberal&quot; and 
<br>
nationalist qualities that can be appreciated, but it had and did use the 
<br>
authoritarian control at its disposal. That is not to say that under his 
<br>
leadership it could not have evolved into a full-fledged democracy, but that 
<br>
was not the likely outcome. In its alienation from the United States and its 
<br>
camp, the most likely source of the much needed aid that would've been 
<br>
required to maintain stability would've come from the Soviets. Needless to 
<br>
say, the track record of the Soviet Union in spreading democracy to its 
<br>
dependents during the Cold War was a decidedly bad one. Additionally, even if 
<br>
one wishes to take the highly unlikely position that Iran would've somehow 
<br>
remained above influence, democracies did not exactly &quot;pop up out of nowhere&quot; 
<br>
in the third world of the 1950's and '60's. Those that somehow did found 
<br>
themselves quickly ousted by military coup d'etat.
<br>
<p>Another serious issue I have with Sean's post is his characterization of the 
<br>
regime of the Shah of Iran. In his post Sean succinctly points out the 
<br>
methods of repression used by the Shah, methods which would lead to the 
<br>
imprisonment (and in many cases deaths) of thousands of Iranians during his 
<br>
25 year regime. This was the dark side of the Pahlavi regime, and something 
<br>
that should be rightfully pointed out. However, Sean in no way gives any sort 
<br>
of historical context to his analysis. What third world regime of this era 
<br>
did not utilize these tactics? Anwar Sadat, a man whose courage to deal with 
<br>
the Israelis is something I greatly admire, was certainly guilty of this kind 
<br>
of repression. Syngman Rhee executed 2000 suspected Communists in South Korea 
<br>
without trial in the early 1950's. Certainly no regime in the Communist camp 
<br>
could plead innocent to this barbarism. In illustrating that other regimes 
<br>
operated in the same way, I do not seek to excuse or justify the Shah's 
<br>
repression. I merely mean to make clear that to pretend or ignore that others 
<br>
didn't is at best ridiculous. To allow unfettered dissent in such a time was 
<br>
to show weakness and vulnerability and sow the seeds of one's own demise, as 
<br>
the Shah would learn a quarter century later. This was the unfortunate 
<br>
reality of this era. The majority of nations in the world were not 
<br>
democracies during the 20th Century. A large portion of the blame for this 
<br>
can be placed on the Soviet Union, which attempted to foster a climate of the 
<br>
exact opposite system of government throughout the globe. To somehow blame 
<br>
repression, or worse a lack of democracy, on the United States is absurd, as 
<br>
it somehow suggests that the world would have had more democracies had the US 
<br>
chosen a policy of inaction and less influence.
<br>
<p>By merely describing the Shah as a heartless tyrant and brutal monster, Sean 
<br>
does a great disservice to both the debate and to much needed perspective. 
<br>
The Shah had many failings, yes. Aside from his authoritarianism, he was also 
<br>
an eccentric who failed to realize his own limitations. But the Shah also 
<br>
succeeded in bringing a quality of life to the Iranians that was not known to 
<br>
anyone else in the Middle East outside of Israel. He sought to modernize his 
<br>
nation and lessen its dependence on the West. In his time he was able to 
<br>
succeed in ways that many Arab rulers have not to this day. And those that 
<br>
would suggest he was merely a puppet of the United States choose to greatly 
<br>
oversimplify matters. His role in the raising of oil prices in the 1970's 
<br>
benefited his nation, not a United States beset by resulting gas shortages 
<br>
and lines. He was no more of a puppet than Japan's Shigeru Yoshida, whose 
<br>
foreign policy initiatives of the 1950's repeatedly frustrated Washington. 
<br>
This labeling merely illustrates the moral relativism that would somehow 
<br>
describe the political systems of the United States and the Soviet Union as 
<br>
equals throughout the Cold War. Never is it illustrated that the proxies of 
<br>
the Americans had the chance to live lives that their Soviet counterparts 
<br>
could only dream of, and the descriptions of Iran are no exception.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shah's accomplishments, especially when compared to those of his 
<br>
neighbors, remain impressive. By 1977, the average household income in Iran 
<br>
was 2,200 dollars. Today in Iran it is only 1600. In Syria only 960 dollars. 
<br>
This number becomes even more astounding when one considers the figure in 
<br>
Iran in 1965 was only 300 dollars.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also determined that his people become a literate one. The 
<br>
literary rate in Iran in 1977 was 85%. Today, it is only 72%, with Iraq at 
<br>
58% and Egypt at 51%. Primary school attendance rose from 270,000 in 1960 to 
<br>
over 10 million in 1977.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shah saw to it that the first major universities, hospitals, and 
<br>
highways in Iran were completed. His regime approved suffrage for women in 
<br>
1963, in addition to allowing them to complete university study. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66% of Iranians owned their homes by 1977, with many of them in fact 
<br>
owning an apartment in addition that they would rent out to finance their 
<br>
children's education in the United States and in Europe. It embittered the 
<br>
Shah that he had provided a way for Iran's young to be educated abroad, only 
<br>
to see them return and protest the &quot;emptiness&quot; of his regime.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a bitterness he would not suffer long. After evacuating Tehran 
<br>
on January 16, 1979, the Shah would eventually spend his last days in Egypt 
<br>
as a guest of his friend President Sadat. Denied asylum by the United States, 
<br>
he would die of cancer in Cairo in July 1980.
