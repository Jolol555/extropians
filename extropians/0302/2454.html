</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The USA has 42,000 (and rising) traffic deaths per year. That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit of damage to the economy, and to all the families involved.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuing increase in death goes along in line with the increased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usage of large cars like SUVs. Why????????
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The large size of the cars is *not* stopping the death toll on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American roads.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, since the US road death toll has been DROPPING as a
<br>
percentage for a number of years, congruent with a rise in the use of
<br>
SUV's, your claims aren't so clear. I might also point out that the US
<br>
death toll on the roads used to be well over 50,000, but dropped
<br>
significantly in response to a society-wide campaign against drunk
<br>
driving.
<br>
<p>It is a fact that recent studies show that 1/3 of drivers responsible
<br>
for traffic accidents are under the influence of drugs other than
<br>
alcohol, particularly marijuana. This mirrors the similar trend in the
<br>
Netherlands.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is very cynical to just shrug and say &quot;Well, people are free to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill themselves if they want to.&quot; Over half of these deaths are just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bystanders who were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People who cause accidents don't just kill themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To quote Leonard Evans again:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'U.S. traffic policy since the 1970s has been dominated by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delusion that safety can be achieved by changing vehicles to increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survivability in crashes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   As measured by traffic deaths per million registered vehicles, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. was the safest nation in the world in the early 1970s. Today it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in 13th place. Better-performing countries have not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done anything that is either extraordinary or draconian -- they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply not fallen into the obsessive focus on marginal factors such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as tires, vehicle defects and airbags that dominate U.S. safety 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy.'
</em><br>
<p>The paramount contributor to traffic deaths in the US is the prevalence
<br>
of youth drivers with insufficient training, and elderly drivers who
<br>
hold onto drivers licenses long after they are no longer physically
<br>
able to be responsible drivers. Other countries are much more strict
<br>
about these two groups, which cause some 80% of all accidents.
<br>
<p>In the US, despite state claims that driving is a 'priviledge'
<br>
conferred by the state, most citizens see driving as a right that
<br>
should not be confiscated under any but the most severe circumstances.
<br>
There is the popular notion that the UN Declaration of Human Rights
<br>
declares a 'right to drive'.
<br>
<p>ANY nation which is more free than another is going to have more of its
<br>
citizens being injured and killed from their own stupidity and
<br>
irresponsibility than those who live in the less free nation and are
<br>
coddle and protected by the state from themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By being dependent on excessive oil consumption, the USA is handing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over billions of dollars to the oil-producing countries and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generating huge amounts of wealth in those countries. 
</em><br>
<p>Irrelevant. Fuel economy has no impact on vehicle safety, nor does the
<br>
degree to which gas consumers enrich third world thugs.
<br>
<p>I might point out that it is europe which consumes far more middle east
<br>
oil than the US does, so if anybody is enriching terrorists and
<br>
tyrants, europe is more to blame, which explains the current policies
<br>
of France and Germany.
