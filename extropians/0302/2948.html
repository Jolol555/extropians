</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Having rid the Afghanistan of the Taliban you seem to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be taking on the additional burden of supporting them.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Even a little thought will show that your analysis is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; faulty. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Afghanistan has a history of instability and chaos that goes back 30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years... From a purely selfish standpoint we don't want to allow such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a thing to happen again.  We want there to be a democratic, affluent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stable society in Afghanistan, because societies like that create fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but you are proposing to *change* the culture of an
<br>
entire nation.  This sounds distantly familiar: a century ago
<br>
it was believed that war and poverty could be abolished by
<br>
educating people properly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, you would think we would create a policy that would encourage such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a society to come into existence.  Now, so far we've spent around $15
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Billion on the war in Afghanistan, and continue to spend around $1.8
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Billion a month there on military deployment.  By contrast, we've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spent between $200 and $300 million on reconstruction and peace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping.  To me this seems quite short sighted.  It focuses resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the immediate crisis without investing in preventing the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crisis.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with dumping money on third-world countries
<br>
is shown by the messes that the World Bank and the IMF
<br>
create every time that they try to do so.  The nations
<br>
of Africa (for one) are worse off than if they'd been
<br>
left alone.  And that stands to reason when you think
<br>
of the money going to corrupt politicians or disrupting
<br>
incipient wealth producing aspects of the economy.
<br>
<p>It's easy to wave one's hands and say &quot;schools, infrastructure,
<br>
and investment&quot;, but, as the old saying goes, you can't teach
<br>
someone how to fish by throwing a fishing pole his way, especially
<br>
if he'd rather do something else, like fight other tribes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Currently the UN has a peace keeping force that patrols Kabul, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capital of Afghanistan.  There are exactly 0 US personnel in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peace keeping force.  Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeatedly asked for a larger peace keeping force that can patrol the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire country and help reign in the warlords.  His requests have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denied.  He has also asked for US assistance in training an Afghan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police force and Afghan military that would be under the control of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the democratically elected government.  The US has denied these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requests as well.
</em><br>
<p>This is a *tough* question!  If you help a country too much,
<br>
even in fighting its rebels or its wars, it becomes dependent.
<br>
It does not develop the ability on its own, which is absolutely
<br>
crucial.  I don't know; perhaps what you do is give them just
<br>
enough money to prevent them from being utterly defeated?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Frankly, Afghanistan is on a course for anarchy.  Only strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investment in rebuilding and stabilizing that country will prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.  And no one, and especially not the US, seems to be willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make that investment.
</em><br>
<p>It may be that wiser heads than yours or mine have deemed it
<br>
impossible.  It's likely that at this stage of Afghan history
<br>
the choice is either anarchy or cruel despotism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With this kind a track record, I simply don't trust the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US to do the right thing in Iraq.  
</em><br>
<p>But the U.S. did do the right thing after World War II?
<br>
<p>If so, then let's see what's different:  the fact that there
<br>
was a massive totalitarian enemy is one thing, but then, as
<br>
you point out, the practical enemy of the U.S. is terrorism,
<br>
so that's probably not the crucial difference.
<br>
<p>I think that the crucial difference is that Japan and Germany
<br>
were already extremely developed nations, and had the talent
<br>
to assimilate the habits of democracy.  Surely you don't
<br>
suppose that Afghanistan is as capable as they were.
