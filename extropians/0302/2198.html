</em><br>
<p>Ah, you have become a functionalist! Welcome to our camp! :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And it is pretty hard to imagine mathematics that is self aware, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that must be the consequence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To take an example: The famous chinese room.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/c/chineser.htm">http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/c/chineser.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not the room which is intelligent, but that calculations taking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place inside the room.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is what makes it so hard to grasp untuitively that intelligence can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take place there. The room itself is not what is alive ot intelligent, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the calculations taking place on those paper pieces are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The room is just the interface with the world. A very bad interface. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence that could take place in those pieces of paper would have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor understanding of the world.
</em><br>
<p>But can you get information without matter? The more I have studied
<br>
information physics, the more information seems to be physical - it is
<br>
not something that floats around on its own, but something that has to
<br>
be encoded/implemented in matter of some kind to remain. 
<br>
<p>The intelligence of the Chinese room might have a poor interface to the
<br>
rest of the world, but that doesn't affect the quality of its internal
<br>
thinking (which we outsiders might view as slow and physically
<br>
inefficient, but that is another matter. We can always criticise each
<br>
other's brains). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So the amusing thing is that, given enough time, it should be possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to run a program with a pencil, on a piece paper, that has intelligence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and conscience. If you stop writing the life ends and you kill your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'creature'.
</em><br>
<p>Or rather, it is indefinitely suspended. A bit like placed in stasis. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It makes you wonder if life can suddenly come into spontaneous existence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the computations that is taking place on the net. I cannot see why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not. Shurely it cannot be a worse medium than atoms in water. Unless it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is too deterministic.
</em><br>
<p>I saw a paper suggesting that the spontaneous creation of computer
<br>
viruses was not as small as commonly believed; with computers with
<br>
crashing code and memory overwrites simple viruses could presumably
<br>
develop on their own and start propagating. Not the likeliest occurence, 
<br>
but once it happened it would spread. Cyberspace is on the other hand 
<br>
already crammed with replicators, so it would probably be out-competed. 
<br>
<p>The step towards thinking is another thing. Again, there is too much
<br>
&quot;pollution&quot; from outside sources to make it visible if it exists. Maybe
<br>
one should start a SDI project: the Search for Digital Intelligence. 
<br>
SDI@Home to analyse net traffic?
