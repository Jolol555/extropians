<p>So it seems. Saddam has killed every opposition, especially muslim 
<br>
activists. But if the military pressure gets stronger, who can tell what 
<br>
strange coalitions will be forged. There are dozens, if not hundreds of 
<br>
small to medium paramilitary groups in Iraq fighting since decades. At 
<br>
least three large factions of kurdish militia against each other, some 
<br>
handfull of smaller kurdish groups, several muslim groups, iraqi military 
<br>
and so on. All against all, daily coalitions and breach of coalitions. 
<br>
Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other sources are financing 
<br>
criss-cross. 
<br>
<p>It's easy to see why even US intelligence agencies haven't found a proof 
<br>
for collaboration between Saddam and muslim extremists: They don't have a 
<br>
clue what's really going on when it doesn't show on their satellite 
<br>
pictures.
<br>
<p>Oh, by the way: According to a news report in german TV on Sunday 
<br>
(Weltspiegel), the Iraqi military has parked tanks in civilian housing 
<br>
areas near the turkish border. Mainily to keep the local kurds and 
<br>
relocated Iraqis[1] under control, as one kurd militia man said, but 
<br>
every invasion army will have to &quot;neutralize&quot; these. I would be more than 
<br>
surprised, if this will not cause a mass murder of civilians. And these 
<br>
civilians mostly can not leave the area, becuase the iraqi troops won't 
<br>
let them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai
<br>
<p>[1] Iraq expels all kurds suspected to be part of the opposition and 
<br>
relocates iraqi people from the south against their will into the free 
<br>
houses. The regime calls this &quot;arabization&quot;. There are large kurdish 
<br>
refugee camps on the turkish side of the border. Guess what these people 
<br>
will do when the Iraqi military is gone.
