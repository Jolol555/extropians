<p><em>&gt; The real tragedy here is that a single accident can be so devastating. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If seven good people have been killed in a car crash it would at most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have appeared on local news, and a plane crash would at most merit a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small national news mention unless it was particularly bad.
</em><br>
<p>I have to admit that I am less shaken up than most on this
<br>
list.  I was more upset in 1986 when the Challenger blew up,
<br>
but then, I was at work and everyone was commiserating.
<br>
Today, I overslept (like Michael), and have only heard
<br>
about it on radio.  Even so, I'll bet that television
<br>
would have made it more sorrowful, because you could see
<br>
how deeply affected the anchor-people were.
<br>
<p>I would have been more saddened by the demise of even of
<br>
someone I never met on this list, say Rafal or Eliezer or
<br>
Damien with whom I've exchanged quite a few posts.  Perhaps
<br>
there is no accounting for how tragedy affects one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In a mature field there would be many other groups and systems that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would to some extent buffer an accident - if a plane goes down, it won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freeze air traffic as a whole. But in a highly concentrated field -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human gene therapy, the Concorde, the space program - accidents not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean the direct loss, but also a setback for the entire field. In order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to avoid risks to the other important parts of the project all activity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is closed down in order to investigate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there is a further problem. The early railway crashes did not end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; railways, it just led to the creation of safer railways. But the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hindenburg crash spelled the end of the whole field of commercial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zeppelins. The difference was the spread of active support for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, how many different projects/approaches there are and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially if the general perception of the technology is that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed.
</em><br>
<p>The difference was more than that.  The Americans had already become
<br>
very wary of airships, with two huge disasters due to storms having
<br>
nearly killed the projects already.  The Hindenburg just finished it
<br>
off, at least in the U.S.A.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We need to get away from this risky, brittle elite project stage for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many of our pet technologies, especially genetics and space. Setbacks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen, but they should be something to learn from rather the end of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endeavor.
