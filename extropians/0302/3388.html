<p>
So finally I received a copy of Futurequest from my best friend Dave Forrest
<br>
for my birthday (he had a dusty copy all along the culprit!). Yes I cheated
<br>
and opened it a day early (shopping day begins officially tomorrow). I was
<br>
so excited that I watched it twice. This was in fact the movie that planted
<br>
the nanotech seed in my mind, which later grew into the full blown case of
<br>
nanofever that you all know! So, it was sentimental to see it again now,
<br>
I've been looking forever for copies. I know I have asked on the list before
<br>
(a few years ago) if anyone has the complete 13 part series, but now that I
<br>
have a copy of the nanotech section I thought I would ask again, just in
<br>
case. Thanx!
