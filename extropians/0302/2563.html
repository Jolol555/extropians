<p>
President George Bush today unveiled plans to attack France
<br>
and Germany next week.  &quot;Last time we had to overrun those
<br>
countries, it was to kick an evil dictator's butt and install
<br>
democracy.  This time it's just to knock some sense into 'em,
<br>
which we forgot last time&quot;, he said today in a briefing
<br>
on the White House lawn.  Apparent frustration against
<br>
the former NATO allies has been building all week long.
<br>
<p>Normandy has been selected as the official invasion site,
<br>
though it may be switched at the last moment, the uncertainty
<br>
being intentional, &quot;to befuddle the continentals&quot; he added.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is not the beginning of the end,&quot; said Prime Minister
<br>
Tony Blair from London. &quot;This is not even the end of the
<br>
beginning.  This is rather the beginning of the beginning.
<br>
Never have so many waited so long on so few.  All I can
<br>
promise you is  blood, sweat---&quot;,
<br>
<p>He was interrupted by a reporter who asked, &quot;Mr Prime Minister,
<br>
will there be a problem with the millions of U.S. servicemen
<br>
here the way there was last time, you know, the horny---&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Not at all&quot;, said the PM, &quot;the situation is vastly improved
<br>
over 1944.  Today the troops will have DVDs, internet chat
<br>
rooms, and a host of modern entertainments not available then,
<br>
in addition to certain chemicals I am permitted to say nothing
<br>
about.&quot;
<br>
