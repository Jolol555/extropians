<em>&gt; The effects of Chernobyl where significantly, even though we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1500km 
</em><br>
away. I've found a quote that describes the most important effects: &quot;A 
<br>
large amount of agricultural produce in Europe had to be dumped due to 
<br>
contamination from fallout. For instance, most vegetables in the region 
<br>
around Munich were destroyed because they had become contaminated with 
<br>
iodine-131. The southern portion of the former West Germany was more 
<br>
contaminated than the rest of it. There were also severe restrictions on
<br>
<p>agricultural activities, including sales of meat from three million
<br>
sheep 
<br>
and lambs in northwestern England and the neighboring portions of 
<br>
Scotland and northern Wales, which were affected by rain-out of 
<br>
radioactivity when the fallout cloud passed over them.&quot;[2]
<br>
<p>If we would have just one accident like that in western Europe, we could
<br>
<p>only shut down everything and look for another place to live.
<br>
<p>========
<br>
<p>I understand that the nuclear power plants being designed and built
<br>
today are much smaller in size and safer than the design of Chernobyl.
<br>
<p>Shouldn't it be possible to design such a facility underground to
<br>
contain whatever accidents might arise?  This may add to the overall
<br>
cost of the project but should remediate a large portion of the risk
<br>
involved and local opposition.  
<br>
<p>In the event of an accident, workers could be evacuated and the facility
<br>
could be sealed.
<br>
<p>HAZMAT clean up could be undertaken once it had burned itself out and
<br>
cooled containing the contamination.

<em>&gt; Argonne Labs here, had its IFR (Integral Fast Reactor) program

<p>Oops, liquid Na coolant, just next to high pressure steam. Na is 
<br>
extremely difficult to handle and in its liquid form is a hazard by 
<br>
itself. What happens if the core is shut down? You can't open the liquid
<br>
<p>Na to the open air. How is the coolant kept flowing in case of a shut 
<br>
down? Na also transmutes under neutron radiation to Na-24, which decays 
<br>
to Mg-24. That makes a Mg extraction necessary, which will also be 
<br>
contaminated.
<br>
<p>&quot;Sodium catches fire on contact with air and explodes on contact with 
<br>
water.  Further, the nucleus of ordinary sodium absorbs a neutron and 
<br>
turns into a highly radioactive isotope sodium-24. [I don't know the
<br>
rate 
<br>
of this reaction and Na24 has a t1/2 of only 15h, so I can't estimate
<br>
the 
<br>
radioactive risk of Na24 --Kai] [...] To prevent leakage of sodium-24 
<br>
into the environment, sodium-cooled reactors are designed with two
<br>
liquid 
<br>
sodium loops.  The secondary, non- radioactive sodium loop draws heat 
<br>
from the primary loop and, in turn, is used to boil water in a steam 
<br>
generator.  The December 1995 accident at the Japanese breeder reactor
<br>
at 
<br>
Monju involved a large leak of sodium from the secondary loop.&quot;[1]

<p><em>&gt; The &quot;FSU&quot; (good acronym!) has a multitude of sins to answer for - but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that in a free market, power plants would be built 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibly and run responsibly - because to do otherwise would ruin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the profits.
</em><br>
<p>As far as I've seen free (i.e. totally uncontrolled) markets, the
<br>
profits 
<br>
will be driven to the maximum (also by reducing costs for safety, 
<br>
security and personnel) by shareholders far away enough. These 
<br>
shareholders will write off their investment at the point where the
<br>
risks 
<br>
and costs rise, and the profit decreases, leaving the ruin behind with
<br>
no 
<br>
budget to cover the proper handling, probably sell it for a Dollar to a 
<br>
post box corp. After all, safety is always a cost factor and becomes
<br>
even 
<br>
more uneconomical when not being outweighted by profits.
