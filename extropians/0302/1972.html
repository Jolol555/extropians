<p><em>&gt; Among other things, the documentary portrayed the original 1955-56 bus boycott in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Montgomery, Alabama (which eventually resulted in the city's busses taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down signs dictating &quot;Negroes go to the back of the bus&quot;).  Although I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read about it and seen the bus boycott presented in other documentaries such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; - I was again taken by the sheet nobleness of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boycott.  ...  If Lee Corbin ever sees that documentary (originally produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by HBO) and tells me he thinks that that bus boycott was &quot;obnoxious&quot; ... I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eat my firstborn.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's a pretty strong claim! ;-)  Incidentally, boycotts
<br>
have never seemed the least objectionable to me.  Let's 
<br>
consider the hardest case.  There is a product X that is
<br>
of personal benefit to me to purchase, yet the producers
<br>
of the product support political causes I don't like, or
<br>
have aroused my ire in other ways.  What should I do?
<br>
<p>My choice in game theoretic terms is either (C) cooperate
<br>
with others who feel the way that I do, and we may have
<br>
an effect on that company.  (This ignores the possibility
<br>
of feeling personal satisfaction in taking even ineffective
<br>
action against a foe), or (D) to defect.  The latter is an
<br>
appealing option because &quot;one vote probably doesn't matter&quot;,
<br>
and so the boycott may succeed without me.  I can take an
<br>
even more unprincipled tack by publicly supporting the boycott,
<br>
but privately continuing to purchase X.  Again, boycotts seem
<br>
fine to me.
<br>
<p>There next arises the matter on how one's boycott could be
<br>
publicized, and it's here where I probably part company with
<br>
most people.  A meeting of an &quot;action committee&quot; that I join
<br>
to further a cause characteristically essays a number of
<br>
attention-getting devices.  &quot;Let's tie up traffic on the
<br>
Golden Gate Bridge!&quot;, &quot;or let's string a banner on all the
<br>
freeway overpasses in the city!&quot;.  That's for sure the short
<br>
circuit to getting publicity for your cause.
<br>
<p>I see demonstrations in exactly this light.  Rather than allow
<br>
for the memes to permeate our society through ordinary discourse,
<br>
a short-circuit is sought.  We gamble that our memes will prevail
<br>
eventually---that it's actually true that they'll resonate with
<br>
people at large---but we don't want any delay at all if possible.
<br>
Again: this is just something that you don't want *everyone* to
<br>
do.  And so unless you have some objectively credible evidence
<br>
that suggests that you are in a special position, I still contend
<br>
that you should forego this shortcut.
<br>
<p>My example of being visited by aliens was not taken seriously.
<br>
So let's suppose instead that you are a medical professional,
<br>
but for various reasons there are very few in your district,
<br>
and what there are have been disgraced by their views.  (Say
<br>
that all the medical practitioners in your country have been
<br>
associated with some heinous dogma, e.g., abortions are up
<br>
to the choice of the woman involved.)  Now a genuine public
<br>
health issue arises:  the ground water is poisoned, and people
<br>
will soon start dying in great numbers.  What to do?
<br>
<p>In this case, there is objective evidence that you *are* in
<br>
a special position, and it's morally warranted that you take
<br>
whatever shortcuts you can---possibly even violently interrupting
<br>
a television broadcast in order that your message go out.

<p>Of course, that's preferable to the alternative, but
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hardly a more gentle but determined means to end a great evil could

</em><br>
<p>Either the beliefs in segregation and governmental discrimination
<br>
were destined to be overcome in time, or they weren't.  I think 
<br>
that it was just a matter of time.  But patience along these lines
<br>
was not acceptable to a number of the people involved, and while
<br>
I have sympathy for their feelings, I have no sympathy for their
<br>
tactics.
<br>
<p>The issue was forced.  And we are going to be paying the price for
<br>
that &quot;forcing&quot; for a long time.  To this day, one will always wonder
<br>
whether one's black doctor (for example) is truly qualified.  Is
<br>
he or she *really* capable, or is his/her degree a consequence of
<br>
reverse discrimination?  It's evils like these that directly 
<br>
resulted from such mass movements and taking to the streets to
<br>
demand immediate change--- immediate change that should have and
<br>
ought to have take a generation or more.
<br>
<p>Desegregation was also achieved &quot;by force&quot;, namely forced busing.
<br>
Well, what's happened to it?  You don't see or hear very much
<br>
about it any longer.  The answer is, it didn't really accomplish
<br>
anything.  The positive changes that did result from the civil
<br>
rights movements---that people more quickly came to the reality
<br>
of interpersonal relationships and came more quickly to understand
<br>
that it all depends on the individual and not the group---was
<br>
initially accelerated, all right.  But it's payback time:  now
<br>
we're stuck being a medley of groups; people are less judged
<br>
individually on the content of their character than on the color
<br>
of their skin, almost as bad as before.
