<p>When one wonders about &quot;reputable&quot; theories versus &quot;fringe&quot; theories, it 
<br>
helps to consider the current STRENGTH of the consensus that modern science 
<br>
has on a given topic.  At the moment, the Big Bang theory is THE theory of 
<br>
the evolution of the universe. It is also generally regarded as being fatally 
<br>
flawed in a number of different ways.
<br>
<p>That is, we know that, as currently stated, its wrong. Since documentaries 
<br>
and teachers alike prefer to teach a mature theory (even a wrong one) than 
<br>
admit to ignorance, the Big Bang still gets taught.
<br>
<p>Now, that doesn't mean that any fringe theory is as good as any other, or 
<br>
that there isn't evidence to support a Big-Bang-like-event starting our 
<br>
universe, but it does mean that you are perfectly correct to propose 
<br>
alternate theories.
<br>
<p>One thing that I try to remind myself whenever I write science fiction, is 
<br>
that todays best theories are tomorrow's laughing stock. Its perfectly 
<br>
acceptible to have a 23rd century dialogue that goes:
<br>
<p>Pete: &quot;Can you believe they used to think that the universe was FINITE and 
<br>
EXPLODED into existance???!!!&quot;
<br>
<p>John: Be fair, they hadn't even invented the gravistator yet. How were they 
<br>
supposed to measure the deep structure of the quantum foam? Without that, the 
<br>
assumption of an initial explosion was as reasonable as any other...
<br>
<p>I remember a TV documentary a few years back that talked about the current 
<br>
problems in cosmology, and they asked one scientist if the controversies 
<br>
didn't dismay him.  He reply, to paraphrase, was something like:
<br>
<p>&quot;Are you kidding? This is a GREAT time to be a cosmologist. Someone needs to 
<br>
invent a new, coherent theory of the creation of the universe, and the first 
<br>
one to succeed is bound to win the Nobel prize. It might even be me!&quot;
