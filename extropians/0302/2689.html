<p>A similar point was made by Lee Harris in
<br>
<a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/defensewrapper.jsp?PID=1051-350&amp;CID=1051-021103A">http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/defensewrapper.jsp?PID=1051-350&amp;CID=1051-021103A</a>i<br>
which also fits in nicely with my short discussion of narratives
<br>
in the media thread (although I have some reservations to his
<br>
tone and generalisations). 
<br>
<p>I found especially the following paragraph illuminating, and a
<br>
bit an echo of Brin:
<br>
<p>&quot;We blame ourselves, and at our best universities there are
<br>
professors who are paid quite nicely to find as much fault with
<br>
our society as it is humanly possible to do. An insane policy by
<br>
any standard you might wish to chose, except that of pure
<br>
pragmatic success -- the most self-critical nation in human
<br>
history is also the first nation to achieve absolute superiority
<br>
over all the other nations of the world; and perhaps, by some
<br>
dialectic irony, it is more through the efforts of men like Noam
<br>
Chomsky than Rush Limbaugh that we possess supreme military
<br>
might. Can you really fear a society in which men like Chomsky
<br>
and Gore Vidal are lionized, as opposed to being shot in the
<br>
middle of the night in a remote forest? A society so absurdly
<br>
tolerant has to be trusted; and it is precisely this trust that
<br>
has kept other nations from arming themselves to the teeth
<br>
against us. Talk is cheap -- and, with the USA as the dominant
<br>
power, quite safe as well. &quot;
<br>
<p>It is the strength of the open society it is all about, and this 
<br>
is also why it is so important to defend it even at home from 
<br>
itself.
