<em>&gt; Why is the current narrative of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. media in Bush's back pocket, if policies are forged that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affects everyone's (U.S. citizen's and others) lives? Who is paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for that narrative?
</em><br>
<p>Do you think it would be very much different with another
<br>
president? There is a hidden assumption in the above that someone
<br>
has &quot;bought&quot; the narrative. But it doesn't have to be like that;
<br>
often leaders are just as caught up in narratives as the rest of
<br>
us (or even more, since acting in a way that does not fit the big
<br>
narrative will cost them voters and respect), and narratives come
<br>
from a variety of sources. Since we often mimick what we
<br>
experience, and much of our experience comes through the media
<br>
there is a strong feedback loop where the journalists and other
<br>
media producers also get caught in typical &quot;working&quot; narratives
<br>
and make them more common. That way you can get a large degree of
<br>
media homogenity without any central attempt to create it. A
<br>
leader that changes to fit a strong narrative (like &quot;patriotic
<br>
serious leader leading us in a just war&quot;) will get implicit
<br>
support from the narratives, even without paying a single penny.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The same is true for other issues. Transhumanism can currently be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;shown in the &quot;excentric people and inventions&quot; narrative, the &quot;wonders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of science&quot; narrative and the frankenscience narrative&quot;. The first one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;trivializes us and our ideas - look how cute they are, believing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;crazy stuff like cloning and nanotech! The second deals with a gadget
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;or idea, reporting about its discovery, nifty features and glorious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;future (for fairness a naysayer is always included). The third shows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;how we are making a faustian pact with technology that will cost us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(and everybody else) our souls.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The last narrative is what the media seems to pick up (and someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pays for) most easily. How to make the narratives be appealing? Space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploration was brought into the limelight again recently, but it took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a tragedy to occur for the media to think it was a sellable story.
</em><br>
<p>A negative message is often a more immediately relevant message:
<br>
there is a danger somewhere, and we feel a need to get informed
<br>
to deal with it. Hence the interest in frankenscience and space
<br>
disasters. The problem is that while it is possible to frame
<br>
transhumanism like that - we want to stop the carnage, the blood
<br>
of billions are on the hands of the luddites etc - is that it
<br>
doesn't really attract people to transhumanism and its way of
<br>
thinking, it pushes people away from other stuff. 
<br>
<p>What really got people pro-space in the tragedy was the mythical
<br>
aspects - the disaster itself just got people to sit up and
<br>
notice a myth that has been rather silent for a while (but now
<br>
also fits in with the somewhat more 40's/50's narrative elsewhere
<br>
in the media). Heroes dying on the way back to Ithaca in a great
<br>
fireball. The promethean determination to dare dangers and the
<br>
occasional punishment for hubris in order to rise up to the
<br>
stars. 
<br>
<p>Transhumanism can of course be clothed in the same mythical 
<br>
narrative, but the risk is that one looks more at the heroism 
<br>
than the practical results - it is a basically romantic notion 
<br>
looking more to ethos and pathos than logos. 
<br>
<p>I think a better way is to get into other narratives with 
<br>
transhumanist ideas. Look at where humanist and enlightenment 
<br>
ideas thrive; then add a bit of transhumanism there too.
