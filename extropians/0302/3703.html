</em><br>
<p>Yes. As Anders points out, these people are not anti-cloning, nor do they
<br>
have a narrow view. Both Fukuyama and Kass have stated clearly and up front
<br>
that they are pro-status-quo in terms of human capabilities. This means
<br>
pro-death, pro-suffering, pro-disease, pro-aging (all of which, again, has
<br>
been clearly stated on numerous occasions). They want there to be no
<br>
expansion of the capabilities of mind and body on their watch. Since these
<br>
bioethicists and hangers-on are in essence Statists, they believe that is is
<br>
perfectly fine to use the engine of the State to coerce, force and impose.
<br>
In other words, they advocate and *actively work towards* mass murder on a
<br>
scale dwarfing anything that humans have &quot;achieved&quot; to date.
<br>
<p>As Anders also points out, they are doing a better job of killing us than we
<br>
are doing of staying alive at this point in time.
