<em>&gt; Yes, to me, they were.  Note I'm not debating the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The means of the original civil rights marches were utterly 
<br>
peaceful and non-violent.  Hardly a more gentle but determined 
<br>
means to end a great evil could have been used.  The means in 
<br>
this case were beautiful, powerful and example of people putting 
<br>
themselvels on the line to oppose oppression.
<br>
<p>The Founders of this country said it was up to the people to 
<br>
stand up if/when other means of addressing real wrongs were not 
<br>
effective or had become perverted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I was in the habit of being annoyed at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;all protests at the time and was generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;rather curt to them along with various other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;protests on the campus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd still be annoyed.  But perhaps not so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I would be over a silly pep-rally!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What does your being &quot;annoyed&quot; really count compared to standing 
<br>
up for what is right?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;But in retrospect I'd have never known
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that they might have had Sweatshop Labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;produced nor would most of the rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the student body.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, to take the slower and fairer route
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not as efficacious, as I was saying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would still prefer posted flyers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handouts over rallies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So the evil continues and the people effected are just supposed 
<br>
to go on day by day as if nothing is wrong?  Is this even acting 
<br>
with integrity?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Since it is legal to protest under certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;regulations, I assure you that the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of people who are driven enough to protest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;already do [march &amp; protest], and to assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;otherwise doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think instead that there are many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who care just as deeply, but who don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen to be organized.  I hope that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't organize.  The present people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *are* organized also hope that all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of those who're unhappy don't organize.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be better IMO if everyone stopped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizing for protest marches and demon-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What for?  Aren't the people apathetic and powerless enough? I 
<br>
wish everyone cared at least enough, not just in their heads but 
<br>
in some action, to get organize and seek redress of wrongs.
