I said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Don't you
</em><br>
see, that the US is internationally isolated , not Germany or France.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Mitch said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Or, France and Germany will be internationally isolated as the Axis of Appeasement :-D  France just invited &gt;Mugabe to the Elysee' Palace for brunch. And you want to stand with such cynics as Chirac?
</em><br>
<p>Please, Mitch, don`t make the mistake to confuse my personal objections against war with the political stance of the country I live in. I have been a rebel to Government all my life, no matter if it was German, Russian, Iraqi or the Nixon-Reagan-Bush administration. I don`t care for Chirac, I don`t care for Schroeder and Fischer, though the latter two are the first German politicians who do not behave like US vasalls and that sure IS a reason for me to support them. You might know about Joschka Fischer's radical youth...
<br>
<p>But anyway, I do not stand for any German political movement. My only concern is the desaster of the poor Iraqi people being exploited by an asshole dicatator and now being bombed by a US aggressor. Call it politically unwise or not, but I don`t care for any country or political group. I am concerned about the suffering of the poor bastards including all the American &quot;private Paula's&quot; who are cheated by this archetypical psychological complex called &quot;senex-puer&quot; conflict: greasy old men sending their grandsons to die. This is what really makes me angry. Being grown up in post war Germany with all the tales about the terrible war, I am so utterly brainwashed to believe that no one has the right to kill people by the 100 thousands.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;Desert Storm One: approximately 300.000 Iraqis dead. No true
<br>
democratic nation can get away with this kind of aggression. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Mass death is surely possible, but I have to ask. Are those death counts supplied by the current Iraqi news &gt;service, a friendly to Iraq publication. Is this factual. Source seems unbiased?
</em><br>
<p>Don`t know. 300.000 are the figures that run through the German media , an alleged &quot;conservative guess&quot;, maybe a few thousand more or less. But one more thing: just because Germany is officially against a war this does not mean that the German media pick up Saddams propaganda and his figures. Everybody here wants him to be removed but by alternative means. (See below)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Ah! The Mighty Hague Tribunal. But to get to the part where Milosovic could stand trial there, it depended on the US finally forcing &gt;the Serbian governement to choose. The Europeans had years to clean their own front steps, and because it wasn't done, &gt;America stepped in, after a couple of hundred thousand perished, that is. So now with Iraq, its still look the other way, still &gt;pretend everything is nice nice. Not smart! Which is what you can say about Jascha, but you can't say about Rumsfeld! :-D
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Cthulu Lives!
</em><br>
<p>No one here pretends that it's nice in Iraq. And: Yes, maybe you are right, without the intervention of the USA Milosevic might still be there slaughtering ethnic minorities. But right now, the Iraq is not at war as Milosevic has been. And there is the German/French plan to disarm Saddam peacefully by powerfully increasing the numbers of WMD inspectors  and do it with patience and  with &quot;a long breath&quot; as we use to say here. If Bush and Rumsfeld really were up to liberate the Iraq people they would happily join in and support this bloodless plan
