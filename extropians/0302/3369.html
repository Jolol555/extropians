Max Plumm, who should be awarded a professorship of history,
<br>
writes a very nice piece on the intricacies of Middle Eastern
<br>
politics 1950-1980, at the height of the Cold War.

<p>Max writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt;       Having addressed the hyperbole on both sides, I would like now to address my main concern with Sean's post. As I commented to Mez, I cannot abide judgments passed on US foreign policy that make it appear these decisions were being made in a vacuum. To &quot;describe&quot; the US-Iranian relationship during the Cold War without once mentioning the Soviet Union, as Sean does, is to simply ignore reality.
</em><br>
&lt;
<br>
<p>This is an absolutely crucial element in attempting to
<br>
understand how many Western governments during this
<br>
period appeared friendly to some despotic tyrants,
<br>
such as Marcos, Franco, or Pinochet.  It was, as I
<br>
said in another post, very probably a choice between
<br>
the lesser of two evils.  For what other reason would,
<br>
for example, an American administration endanger its
<br>
reputation and chances for re-election by allying itself
<br>
with a repressive regime?  The leftists would have you
<br>
think so just because they're purely wicked.
<br>
<p>That being said, Max was extremely circumspect in his
<br>
post acknowledging the danger of letting the notion of
<br>
&quot;the lesser of two evils&quot; cause us to be blind to the
<br>
real moral failings of oppression everywhere; he did
<br>
this by frankly acknowledging the evils of, for example,
<br>
the Shah's regime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Needless to say, the track record of the Soviet Union in spreading democracy to its dependents during the Cold War was a decidedly bad one.  Additionally, even if one wishes to take the highly unlikely position that Iran would've somehow remained above influence, democracies did not exactly &quot;pop up out of nowhere&quot; in the third world of the 1950's and '60's. Those that somehow did found themselves quickly ousted by military coup d'etat.
</em><br>
&lt;
<br>
<p>The sad worry is that in some nations at some times, representative
<br>
democracy is probably impossible, and certainly impossible in the
<br>
instant.  This is an error made over and over again, and often by
<br>
people on this list too.  They still have in their minds the notion
<br>
that people far different from them, with deep traditions and quite
<br>
separate cultures, can simply adopt democracy overnight if only all
<br>
the bad people would get out of the way.  It's quite naive.
<br>
<p>Now, that being said, I am still expecting that the Bush administration,
<br>
or the government of any other western power, will place what is good
<br>
for their own citizens above what is good for those in other countries.
<br>
This is necessary if they want to be re-elected.  Of course, they are
<br>
cognizant that the people themselves in western democracies do care
<br>
more than a whit about conditions in other nations.  This is exactly
<br>
why the Western countries are so relatively benevolent, despite their
<br>
power.
<br>
<p>One thus hopes that genuine concern for the benefit of the common
<br>
people in faraway places does influence the thinking of western
<br>
governments.  Hopefully they see it, correctly, as win-win: the
<br>
freer the peoples all around the world, the better for us too.
