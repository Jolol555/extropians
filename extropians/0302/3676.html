<em>&gt;Can some one give the background on this letter -- it reads like a piece of

</em><br>
<p>I have a good friend in Athens, maybe she has news sources that say more
<br>
I'll ask.
<br>
<p>All I found was the following. I'm impressed by that letter.
<br>
It's rare to find a person of integrity in politics. Count me as
<br>
a new John Brady Kiesling fan.

U.S. diplomat resigns to protest Iraq policy
<br>
Felicity Barringer The New York Times

<br>
<p>UNITED NATIONS, New York A career diplomat who has served in U.S.
<br>
embassies from Tel Aviv to Casablanca to Yerevan resigned this week
<br>
in protest against the country's policies on Iraq.
<br>
<p>The diplomat, John Brady Kiesling, the political counselor at the
<br>
U.S. Embassy in Athens, said in his resignation letter, &quot;Our fervent
<br>
pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us to squander the international
<br>
legitimacy that has been America's most potent weapon of both
<br>
offense and defense since the days of Woodrow Wilson.&quot; Kiesling, 45,
<br>
who has been a diplomat for about 20 years, said Wednesday that he
<br>
faxed the letter to Secretary of State Colin Powell on Monday after
<br>
informing Thomas Miller, the ambassador in Athens, of his decision.
<br>
He said that he had acted alone, but had received support afterward
<br>
from colleagues. &quot;No one has any illusions that the policy will be
<br>
changed,&quot; he added. &quot;Too much has been invested in the war.&quot;
<br>
<p>Louis Fintor, a State Department spokesman, said that he had no
<br>
information on Kiesling's decision and that it was department policy
<br>
not to comment on personnel matters.
<br>
<p>In his letter, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times by
<br>
a friend of Kiesling's, the diplomat wrote Powell: &quot;We should ask
<br>
ourselves why we have failed to persuade more of the world that a
<br>
war with Iraq is necessary. We have over the past two years done too
<br>
much to assert to our world partners that narrow and mercenary U.S.
<br>
interests override the cherished values of our partners.&quot; His letter
<br>
continued: &quot;Even where our aims were not in question, our
<br>
consistency is at issue. The model of Afghanistan is little comfort
<br>
to allies wondering on what basis we plan to rebuild the Middle
<br>
East, and in whose image and interests.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is rare but not unheard-of for a diplomat, immersed in the State
<br>
Department's culture of public support for policy regardless of
<br>
private feelings, to resign with this kind of public blast. From
<br>
1992 to 1994, five State Department officials quit out of
<br>
frustration with the Clinton administration's Balkans policy.
