</em><br>
<em>&gt; however - the acquisition of the land for roads would be quite difficult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You couldn't use eminent domain (or could you?). A single holdout on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; path of a planned highway could demand a lot of cash, or scuttle the project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altogether (e.g., the owner of a mountain pass). This would drive up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices. Also, in certain situations, if the ownership of roads in an area
</em><br>
<em>&gt; became concentrated in one hand, there would be the risk of monopoly rents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being extracted from the citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How could you solve these problems?
</em><br>
<p>Set up a public board (perhaps on the web), with a map divided into small
<br>
plots, or using the actual property lines, and announce planning to build a
<br>
road from point A to point B.  Anyone on the map can post the price for their
<br>
property, even if not on a direct line between A and B.  If participation is
<br>
low,
<br>
you can offer incentives to visit the site.  When enough people have made
<br>
offers that the map is fairly well covered with land which has a price, you can
<br>
pick the few routes with the least apparent cost, and try to negotiate them
<br>
down.  Each person you're negotiating with understands that you're looking
<br>
for the lowest cost, and trying to hold out for more money makes it more
<br>
likely that you'll just go around.
<br>
<p>As for the mountain pass problem, the cost of making your own pass must
<br>
be considered, but I don't think it's a showstopper.
