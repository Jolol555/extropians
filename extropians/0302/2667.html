<p>Yes it certainly does.

<p>Yes, and that is why I am careful to use the word &quot;may.&quot;

<p>ABSTRACT
<br>
Assessing the effects of deprenyl on longevity
<br>
and antioxidant defenses in different animal models

<br>
Among many pharmaceuticals that have been tested for their effects on
<br>
longevities of different animal rodents, deprenyl is unique in that its
<br>
effects on longevity has been tested in at least four different animal
<br>
species by independent research groups and that the effect has been
<br>
postulated to be due to its effect of raising such antioxidant enzyme
<br>
activities as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in selective
<br>
brain regions.  Thus far, in all four species of animals examined (rats,
<br>
mice, hamsters, and dogs), a positive effect was demonstrated, although
<br>
the extent of its effect is quite variable. Our group has examined the
<br>
effect on longevities in rats and mice and on antioxidant enzymes in
<br>
rats, mice, and dogs. Although in rats of both sexes, we have obtained
<br>
positive effects on longevity, two studies with different doses in mice
<br>
did not reveal a significantly positive effect.  We have observed,
<br>
however, significantly positive effects on SOD (in Cu, Zn-, and Mn-) as
<br>
well as CAT (but not glutathione peroxidase) activities in the brain
<br>
dopaminergic system such as in the S. nigra and striatum (but not in
<br>
hippocampus) in all rats, mice, and dogs, although the effects were
<br>
quite variable, depending on the doses used. In mice, however, a
<br>
long-term administration (3x/w, 3 months) caused a remarkable decrease
<br>
in the magnitude of activity as well as a narrowing of the effective
<br>
dose range, which may explain a relatively weak effect of the drug on
<br>
mouse longevity.  Further, a recent study on aging beagle dogs by Ruehl
<br>
et al. showed a remarkable effect on longevity, which agrees with our
<br>
SOD study in dogs.  Although deprenyl has been claimed to have several
<br>
other effects, such as a radical scavenging effect and a neuroprotective
<br>
effect, past reports on its effects on longevities and antioxidant
<br>
defenses are compatible with the notion that the drug prolongs the life
<br>
span of animals by reducing the oxidative damage to the brain
<br>
dopaminergic system during aging.  Further, our studies on F-344 rats as
<br>
well as a dog study by Ruehl et al. suggest that the drug may at least
<br>
partially prolong the life span of animals by enhancing immune system
<br>
function and preventing tumor development in animals.
