writes: The ninth and tenth amendments are very clear, and they were put 
<br>
there for a very good reason: because the framers knew the moment they 
<br>
started putting human rights on paper, some idiot would come along and say 
<br>
&quot;This one wasn't written down, so it must not exist&quot;.
<br>
<p>Lee, you are absolutely right.  We do have those amendments.  I have run into 
<br>
them spcifically in the study of  Roe vs Wade and later in the case of a man 
<br>
that was fired as a security risk based on conversations he had in his bed 
<br>
room with his wife.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with Roe vs Wade as I recall it was that if you look back 
<br>
into American &amp; English legal history it is not at all clear if that is a 
<br>
right that individuals have traditionally had or not.  There is a lot of 
<br>
evidence that if the abortion was done before quickening it was okay.  After 
<br>
quickening I don't remember so much evidence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem I saw was that abortion historically has not been 
<br>
something that folks discussed a lot so discovering past practice isn't that 
<br>
easy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the man fired as a security risk it is clear that the 
<br>
conversation of a man &amp; wife in their bedroom is not admissable in court.  It 
<br>
was also plain that the conversation was made public by the illegal act of 
<br>
some 3rd party.  In other words the couple had not voluntarily made their 
<br>
conversation public either deliberately nor through negligence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student I had to decide and write a paper on the bedroom 
<br>
conversation.  I found for the man that was fired.  As it was a live issue 
<br>
the Supreme Court later issued an opinion backing me up -- clever weren't 
<br>
they?  &lt;VBG&gt;
