OK, here is a version of the message with some useful physical information
<br>
rather than the hype of the home university:
<br>
<p>(if he really goes beyond the Carnot cycle, then there is real news - but
<br>
breaking thermodynamics is hard, since you have to break probability
<br>
theory)
<br>
<p>The quantum afterburner
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 February 2002 
<br>
<a href="http://physicsweb.org/article/news/6/2/2">http://physicsweb.org/article/news/6/2/2</a>
<br>
<p>Quantum mechanics could be used to improve the efficiency of heat engines,
<br>
according to Marlan Scully of Texas A&amp;M University in the US. Scully has
<br>
calculated that exhaust energy from an engine could be used to power a
<br>
laser. This would improve engine performance beyond that of the ideal Otto
<br>
cycle without violating the laws of thermodynamics (M Scully 2002 Phys.
<br>
Rev. Lett.  88 050602).
<br>
<p>Scully considered a simplified version of the Otto cycle, a sequence of
<br>
operations similar to that carried out by a standard car engine. In this
<br>
four-step cycle, a hot gas expands in a cylinder doing useful work before
<br>
it loses heat to its surroundings; then it is compressed and heated again. 
<br>
<p>But Scully added two extra steps. After the heat has dissipated the gas is
<br>
passed through a laser-maser cavity at constant temperature, where it
<br>
deposits useful energy. This cavity is then reheated once the system as a
<br>
whole has been reheated, again at a constant temperature. 
<br>
<p>The crux of Scully's system is that the heating of the cavity does not
<br>
raise the kinetic energy of the atoms in the gas, as the normal heating
<br>
stage does. Instead it increases the internal energy levels of the atoms,
<br>
making them emit photons. Scully calculated that this liberated quantum
<br>
energy was greater than the extra work that would have been produced if
<br>
the additional heat had instead been ploughed into a normal four-stage
<br>
cycle. 
<br>
<p>Scully points out that this result does not violate any laws of
<br>
thermodynamics. He also analysed an equivalent system in a Carnot cycle -
<br>
which, unlike the Otto cycle, runs at the highest efficiency permitted by
<br>
thermodynamics - and found that quantum mechanics could not be used to
<br>
improve the engine's performance. 
<br>
<p>He hints that he has already worked out how to test his idea in the lab
<br>
and that he has conceived several novel laser systems. His idea has been
<br>
dubbed a 'quantum afterburner' because of its parallel with the devices
<br>
that extract useful energy from the exhaust of a jet engine.
