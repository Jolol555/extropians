<p>Do you have a link to the current study that is cited
<br>
in the anti-drug commercials (this is where you got
<br>
the claim from, no?)?  As I recall what they actually
<br>
say is 1/3 of 'drunk drivers' were also found to have
<br>
marijuana in their system which doesn't necessarily
<br>
link marijuana at all, but I may have it wrong...it is
<br>
just a commercial.
<br>
<p>There is this: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.drugabuse.gov/NIDA_Notes/NNVol11N1/Marijuana.html">http://www.drugabuse.gov/NIDA_Notes/NNVol11N1/Marijuana.html</a>
<br>
but it cites right along with it in the headline
<br>
studies with lower numbers, just 32% in the shock
<br>
trauma unit.  And of course the majority had alcohol
<br>
in their system, so while having marijuana in their
<br>
bloodstream, they were not necessarily under the
<br>
influence.  Still can't find this study though or even
<br>
a clear reference of the study outside of this
<br>
government link.
<br>
<p>Also this: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=5450">http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=5450</a>  
<br>
<p>&quot;  A 2002 review of seven separate studies involving
<br>
7,934 drivers reported, “Crash culpability studies
<br>
have failed to demonstrate that drivers with
<br>
cannabinoids in the blood are significantly more
<br>
likely than drug-free drivers to be culpable in road
<br>
crashes.”  &quot;
<br>
<p>here's an Australian study from 1998 that I believe
<br>
was the one later reported on ABC news in October
<br>
1998:

<br>
<p>here's one that could be claimed to be slanted, but if
<br>
anyone has paid for access to the UK sunday times,
<br>
perhaps they may want to check the article for
<br>
validity: 
<br>

<br>
<p>and another from a 1999 Toronto study:  <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/03/990325110700.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/03/990325110700.htm</a>
