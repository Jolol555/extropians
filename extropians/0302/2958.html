<p><em>&gt; I doubt very much that those who want a regime change within

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and in the main determination by foreign countries of what the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new government and its leader should be.  I doubt many of them 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, since you wrote that there has been ample evidence
<br>
in the thread &quot;CULTURE / WAR: More on Harold Pinter&quot;.  
<br>
Moreover, your words where you doubt that many of them believe
<br>
that destruction of infrastructure and death of citizens
<br>
is unacceptable sounds like a Western sentiment more than a
<br>
Middle Eastern one.  The people of the Middle East---all
<br>
the cultures, it appears---are not so worried as we about
<br>
death.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm surprised that I should have to spell it out.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that merely shows how each of us finds the viewpoints
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and arguments of others comparatively alien.
</em><br>
<p>[Note how I immediately explained my remark in a fair,
<br>
friendly, and indeed accurate way.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You do grant the possibility that the uniform pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the armed might of the world might cause him to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accept one of the deals that is talked about, and just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; abdicate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not think we are just positioning to get Saddam to stand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down in the least.  I find your argument spurious.
</em><br>
<p>You don't say why you find it spurious.  It doesn't matter
<br>
if we are just &quot;positioning&quot; or not;  if there was a genuine
<br>
regime change, the allies would have little justification to
<br>
proceed.  (Of course, from your perspective they have little
<br>
anyway---I'm talking about the masses in the middle between
<br>
us.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also I don't believe it is a legitimate tool of diplomacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or reasonable international relations to threaten a country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with eminent invasion and mayhem unless it changes its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leadership to suit you.
</em><br>
<p>I have a question.  When U.S. and British forces had driven
<br>
the Nazis back behind the borders of Germany, was it necessary
<br>
to demand a regime change?  Or would you have said, &quot;Okay, 
<br>
they've been kicked out of France and the other countries,
<br>
why invade them?  Is it legitimate to dictate to the German
<br>
people---who still favor Hitler---that he has to go?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;This resembles ever so much the Vietnam debacle a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;generation ago, the main difference being that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;addition to the encouragement and support given to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the murderous Hanoi regime, western politicians were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;deeply affected by the demonstrations and protests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;as the years went by.  At least this time there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;will not follow such tragic consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;If western politicians do not heed the cry of the people the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;consequences will be tragic indeed.
</em><br>
<p>That's all you wrote---just one single sentence.  I thought
<br>
by &quot;tragic consequences&quot; you meant the death and destruction
<br>
in Iraq that you're always going on about.  How was I to know
<br>
that you meant tragic *here*?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Okay, we have you on record as predicting that.   I'll go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on record as predicting that the deaths of Western soldiers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will be less than a thousand, and that because of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; difficulty that capturing Baghdad poses.  It is said that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some sectors of the city will be so willing to depose Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the first things that arriving troops should do is pass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out pistols.  Other areas are known to be quite loyal to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hussein.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The tragic consequences include the consequences to so-called 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracies of ignoring and overriding the voices of their own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.
</em><br>
<p>In representative government, as you have reminded us before,
<br>
the leaders are elected to lead, not to respond to polls.
<br>
Just as you have explained, we in the West do not have
<br>
democracy, except perhaps in places like France where some
<br>
leaders seem to attend only to the latest polls.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are many other negative consequences of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed action, both planned consequences and likely ones.  But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was principally referring to the damage done to democracies by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;leaders&quot; callously dismissing the wishes of the people.  I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised I had to spell that out to you.
</em><br>
<p>Well, as I said, our views and pre-suppositions do seem 
<br>
alien to each other.  Yet I note that you managed to 
<br>
phrase that in a more aggressive manner than (see above)
<br>
I did.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As for the deaths of Iraqi soldiers and civilians, as General
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; McCafferty (or McCaffrey) said, there's little telling.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expected that the Allied propaganda leaflets already dropped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will cause the main Iraqi army units to surrender quickly, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the Republican Guard units will not.  Civilian casualties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will be almost entirely limited to Baghdad, and will be much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; less than in other wars in which a capital city was conquered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (e.g. Berlin) because of modern capabilities---no block by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; block, street by street fighting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So our unwarranted act of aggression is something you think we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can &quot;get away with&quot; with relatively low body count so we should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proceed?   May history have mercy on such attitudes.
</em><br>
<p>Here you are being most uncharitable.  Why, I myself advanced
<br>
six reasons to invade Iraq.  Do you want to see the list, (a)
<br>
through (f) again?  A low body count was not one of them.
<br>
<p>But if someone advances a reason *not* to do something because
<br>
too many lives would be lost, that argument must stand until
<br>
either evidence against it is presented, or until what is meant
<br>
by &quot;too many&quot; is clarified.
<br>
