<p><em>&gt; &quot;Brett Paatsch&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paatschb@ocean.com.au?Subject=Re:%20Internet%20and%20defamation%20laws">paatschb@ocean.com.au</a>&gt; Wrote:

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; I like free speech AND defamation laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mutually exclusive.
</em><br>
<p>On any one particular point that may be so. But not generally. I mean it
<br>
is possible when one is considering social policy to hold that free speech
<br>
is the blanket proposition. It is what society should seek except in those
<br>
defined subsets of cases where the general soundness of the principle
<br>
ceases to hold. I think defamation laws, well and sensibly construed as
<br>
exceptions to the generally sound position of free speech can further
<br>
refine and vitalise society. As aspects of social policy and as extropic
<br>
tools both can play a role in the same society. But nothing in this amounts
<br>
to a particular defence or otherwise of existing defamation laws. Naturally
<br>
there will be tensions between the general principle of free speech and when
<br>
particular exceptions to that general principle can be made. It is at
<br>
the points of tension where our interest is best focussed imo. But
<br>
to argue that free speech in all circumstances is the highest imperative
<br>
seems impractical and unworldly. It seems to make for a kind of
<br>
abstract idealism that doesn't fit usefully within the world most of us
<br>
actually live in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In the long run everybody would benefit if defamation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws were abolished, except for trial lawyers.
</em><br>
<p>Nah. Too inefficient. Lawyers for all that may be wrong or right with
<br>
them are a useful part of the &quot;social ecosystem&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You seem to think that if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't have libel laws the sum total of all reputations in a society would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go down,
</em><br>
<p>Yes I think this is a fair summary of my position.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't see how that could happen
</em><br>
<p>I think it happens because people have too make decisions including
<br>
decisions on each others character, trustworthiness etc, on the
<br>
information available and people don't have full or complete information.
<br>
It's quite easy and efficient as a competitive strategy (if society doesn't
<br>
recognize and counter that easiness and effectiveness) to smear with
<br>
countermeasures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and don't see how it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter  if it did, reputation is a relative scale after all. I think libel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws just  make reputations more inaccurate.
</em><br>
<p>I think it matters because we'd all have to spend a lot more time defending
<br>
against specious attacks because of the nature of human perceptions and
<br>
judgements in social situations where imperfect information and non
<br>
transparency is a fact of contemporary life. This is just inefficient for
<br>
society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;  Free speech can sometimes  be cheap speech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It usually is, but so what? If I say bad things about you it will only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really damaging to you if my reputation is good. If I have a history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making similar charges that turned out to be untrue anything I say will
</em><br>
just
<br>
<em>&gt; be shrugged off. I think a free market of ideas should determine what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true and what is not, the idea of some an official body making such a
</em><br>
decree
<br>
<em>&gt; gives me the creeps.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;despite understanding the principle of tit-for-tat, one doesn't need
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;to personally punch every nose, return every shot or refute every bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;of pissant nastiness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could not agree more.
</em><br>
<p>Ok good. But what I think follows from this is not that tit for tat is
<br>
not valid and/or that we don't need countermeasures and responses
<br>
to those forms of competitive behaving which come from a zero sum
<br>
game mindset seek to win by attacking the effectiveness of the other.
<br>
What follows, I think, is that effective people who are not zero sum
<br>
gamers themselves, but still recognize that zero sum games are how
<br>
others see much of the competitive world and form the basis on which
<br>
&nbsp;others choose to compete, still need to have some countermeasure
<br>
&nbsp;response to the zero sum gamers attacks.
<br>
<p>Only being able to respond personally with speech for speech restricts
<br>
the effective person. This is exactly the sort of person that it is in
<br>
societies
<br>
interests (if that person is not anti-social) not to restrict.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;By leveraging knowledge of the law one can  delegate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not delegate to your potential customers, let them figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out what your reputation should be.
</em><br>
<p>My &quot;customers&quot; will be making decisions about me on the basis of
<br>
imperfect information no matter what I do.  If someone wants
<br>
something I am selling but has other potential suppliers, it is not
<br>
efficient for them to have to sift through a bunch of claims and counter
<br>
claims. They, the customers, are likely to conclude that maybe where
<br>
&nbsp;there is smoke there is fire and they don't know or really care so
<br>
long as they can find an alternative supplier with less doubt associated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The successful ones will be those who have correctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined what your reputation should be, those who don't want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do business with you because they incorrectly think your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reputation is too low  will soon be put out of business by those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who make the correct judgments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ok. I'm changing the frame of reference a bit going from businessman
<br>
to politician but the principle of people having to decide between
<br>
competitive offerings (and reputations) on imperfect information is the
<br>
same. In politics 'the customer' is the voter and the voter doesn't go
<br>
out of business simply because they vote badly. So in politics its
<br>
&nbsp;necessary to be careful and efficient in the message and impression
<br>
&nbsp;that is sent out. In politics what matters for the setting of
<br>
policy is not how many smart votes one gets but how many votes in
<br>
&nbsp;favor of a particular proposition. For a particular proposition two
<br>
dumb ill-considered votes count for twice as much as one very well
<br>
considered vote.
