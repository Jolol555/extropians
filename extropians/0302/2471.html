<p>A very good question indeed, Samantha.  As a teenager I often took
<br>
child-sitting jobs because a) I got paid to sit quietly, studying and b)
<br>
I enjoyed being with children.  Nothing weird about that: I had grown up
<br>
in a family surrounded by younger children, and as a teenager had moved
<br>
away from home - and found I missed the kids.  When I hit twenty years
<br>
old, one parent asked me: &quot;Don't you ever worry about being considered a
<br>
pervert?&quot; (not nastily, just asking)  It quite shook me up, I can tell
<br>
you.  I answered: &quot;Well, no.  Do you think I should worry?&quot;  The Mother
<br>
shook her head, and left for an evening out with her husband.  That
<br>
night, for the first time ever, I felt a twinge of discomfort when
<br>
reading a bed-time story to a child.
<br>
<p>It is saddening to see people raise eyebrows over bed-sharing, and you
<br>
see it especially often when the adult is male.  When an adult shares a
<br>
bed with a child, it seems the current default assumption is: 'looking
<br>
for sexual jollies'.  It used to be: 'providing comfort and warmth'.
<br>
What went wrong?  Is society becoming more cynical?
