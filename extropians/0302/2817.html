Mike Lorrey writes (I have disturbed the order of his remarks)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I've detailed recently, freeing the Iraqi people from Saddam and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opening Iraqi oil to full exploitation by western industry will cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the collapse of the European social welfare infrastructure, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing so means one thing: cheap oil.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; It is understandable that Germans are so hip-deep in their social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare state that the need to keep it financed is the primary domestic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and foreign policy dog-wagger, such that any policy by any country that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threatens it is automatically wrong and evil. Even socialists are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primarily motivated by self-interest, even if it is a collective one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given this, it is understandable that Germans cannot help but look on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush with distain and hate.
</em><br>
<p>Your analysis (which I hope you keep developing and explaining)
<br>
of the economic implications to their welfare state is much
<br>
appreciated.  And it could be that those---the &quot;influential&quot;---
<br>
who shape public opinion understand this the threat to their
<br>
system.  But are you also claiming that the typical German does?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What surprises me is that so many Germans, and others, seem to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the problem is with Bush and not Saddam. This is a blind spot on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the part of the Germans. While Arnett might be right about the US, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can say the same thing about Germany: Germans do not seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitutionally capable of having a rational discussion about the need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to dispose of Saddam's regime and free the Iraqi people. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it because German companies are so complicit in the Iraqi war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine? How many German politicians are being paid off by these German
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies? How many German TV channels are owned by these companies?
</em><br>
<p>We need a thread on how opinions spread and develop within
<br>
free countries.  Now, if everyone were as much an ideologue
<br>
as I am---and consciously or not this may be the case---then
<br>
it all comes down to whose side you're on.  Deep emotions
<br>
unconsciously guide the perception process so that you almost
<br>
cannot help but come to the desired ideological conclusions.
<br>
But suppose that I'm wrong, and the &quot;influential&quot; determine
<br>
most things, as a new book claims.  What do you (or does
<br>
anyone) suppose is really the truth about this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here in the US, we've had more than a decade of dealing with Saddam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lies and deceptions. He is a known quantity, and for Americans, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea that there is any reason for any person with an ounce of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence to have not made up their mind about doing something about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him by this point in time is ludicrous.
</em><br>
<p>As I said in an earlier post, I don't understand how you can consider
<br>
it to be a question of intelligence.  So I presume that the foregoing
<br>
is indicative of a bad verbal habit.  On the other hand, perhaps you
<br>
are quite correct (I don't really know) about Saddam's behavior being
<br>
more in the public eye in the U.S. than elsewhere.  Frankly, I doubt
<br>
it---well-informed people overseas surely understood his shenanigans
<br>
as well as well-informed people here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Americans know what their self interest is, and that interest is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to take a principled stand for the liberty of the Iraqi people.
</em><br>
<p>Why would you suppose that Americans were more idealistic and
<br>
less prone to be acting self-interestedly than the others?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find it rather hilarious that the French see no problem with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves taking unilateral action in the Ivory Coast for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own self interest, yet continue to call the Anglospheric coalition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the US, Britain, Australia, along with countries like Spain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Portugal, Italy, and many eastern European nations a 'unilateral'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action if we take it outside the UN umbrella.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that conclusion seems inescapable.
<br>
<p>Lee
