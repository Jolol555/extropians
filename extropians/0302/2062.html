You can rail against the good Mullah and his chums for his hatred and 
<br>
aggression. But I sure cannot fault him for getting to the point and speaking 
<br>
directly. At least he knows what he wants, his directions, his focus. We 
<br>
shan't fault the Jihadis for that. In this, they are nothing but honest. 
<br>
Sorry to disillusion the group here, but I suspect he does indeed speak for 
<br>
many who lack his forthrightness.  No sugar coating here.

<p>Hamza: 'Disaster was sign from God'
<br>
19.17PM GMT, 3 Feb 2003
<br>
Controversial Muslim cleric Abu Hamza has said that the Columbia shuttle
<br>
disaster was a &quot;Trinity of Evil&quot; punished with death by Allah.
<br>
<p>The outspoken cleric, who until recently preached at Finsbury Park mosque in
<br>
north London, made the claim because the Columbia carried Americans, an
<br>
Israeli Jew and an Indian-born Hindu - and it blew up over an area called
<br>
Palestine.
<br>
<p>The cleric is now banned from preaching at the mosque because of his
<br>
inflammatory sermons.
<br>
<p>He said British Muslims would take the shuttle disaster as a &quot;sign from God&quot;
<br>
that the first Israeli in space was killed over an area of Texas called
<br>
Palestine.
<br>
<p>He added: &quot;The Muslim people see these pilots as criminals. By going into
<br>
space they would have sharpened the accuracy of their bombs through
<br>
satellites.&quot;&gt;&gt;
