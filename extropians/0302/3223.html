<br>
Though I believe I think and espouse many of the principles I would hope it 
<br>
promotes.  My impression of the position that Mez holds seems to *not* be 
<br>
significantly different from mine or that I would expect to find in TMoC.
<br>
<p>Robert,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem more than normally knowledgeable in this area so lets see if 
<br>
you are onto the main point of TMoC.  A test will be held but it is self 
<br>
grading and for personal interest only.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. deSoto as you might guess is a capitalist.  However the mainpoint 
<br>
of what he is promoting is that each country must have a body of law that 
<br>
makes it possible to own private property, to have a system so that the 
<br>
private owner of each piece of property can be proven in a court of law -- I 
<br>
phrased it that way because we want to be able to prove that a certain party 
<br>
owns a certain piece of property as well as the private owner have the 
<br>
ability to prove that a certain piece of property belongs to them.  Dr. de 
<br>
Soto considers this absolutely vital to the formation of capital.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you pass??  I wouldn't have before reading his book.
