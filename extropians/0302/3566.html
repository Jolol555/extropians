</em><br>
<p>Ron, I don't understand your comment, but my sense of it encourages
<br>
me to encorage you to play nicely.
<br>
<p>Now, with respect to biological WMDs I do have a bit of expertise
<br>
(more than I really want) so I'll offer a couple of concrete
<br>
comments based on my most recent knowledge.
<br>
<p>The U.S. (and Russia) are allowed by international agreements
<br>
to retain samples of the Smallpox virus.  This is rather
<br>
irrelevant since its genome sequence is known (I even have
<br>
a copy of it in case the &quot;thought police&quot; have removed it
<br>
from public access).  Therefore anyone with sufficient
<br>
financial resources (and molecular biology talent) could
<br>
recreate it from scratch.
<br>
<p>With respect to other potential biological WMD -- at this
<br>
time it is generally true that anyone who wants to vaccinate
<br>
people against such agents has to be able to grow them
<br>
(or at least significant fractions of them).
<br>
<p>So Kai is likely to be correct -- the U.S. most likely does have
<br>
the ability to grow relatively large quantities of biological
<br>
WMD and certainly has the knowledge of how to weaponize them
<br>
(since this was developed several decades ago and such knowledge
<br>
once gained doesn't &quot;go away&quot;).
<br>
<p>But, I strongly question the statement &quot;that the US still has
<br>
biological WMDs (which they are not allowed to have)&quot;.
<br>
<p>The US helped to initiate the treaties against chemical and
<br>
biological weapons precisely because they are very imprecise
<br>
weapons.  I am relatively confident that we have destroyed
<br>
any large quantities of such weapons because they do not
<br>
have the benefit-to-risk ratio the U.S. military desires.
<br>
<p>Now -- it is however well documented that Russia still has
<br>
*tons* of biological WMD (many of which were much more
<br>
dangerous than any the U.S. developed) that they have not
<br>
yet destroyed.
<br>
<p>If you want to point a finger at &quot;risks to humanity&quot; it
<br>
should be pointed at a location roughly completely opposite
<br>
of the U.S. on a global map.
<br>
<p>Robert
