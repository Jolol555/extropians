</em><br>
<p>Group selection is hardly dead.  See the Simpson's Paradox arguments
<br>
for starters.  I would further recommend &quot;Unto Others&quot;, a fairly
<br>
good and comprehensive case for group selection.  At the larger
<br>
level, group selection appears as a different description of
<br>
phenomena lying under other concepts in other interpretations.
<br>
<p>Secondly, there is indeed a selectionist effect of memes.  To
<br>
some degree your most ardent patriot and devout internationalist
<br>
have beliefs substantially influenced by their environments.  So
<br>
even if there were no *biological* group selection effect, there
<br>
certainly is a cultural one (though it should be called something
<br>
else).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yet you are not annoyed by the irrational love of a mother
</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; Body count.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary.  Patriotism (which is a form of community spirit)
<br>
helped to make organized society possible.  As I said to the other
<br>
LDC, if you'd been raised in a close tightly-knit community under
<br>
threat of destruction from other groups, you'd probably feel
<br>
differently.  Today we citizens of large nations are not so
<br>
consciously aware of the trials of those who founded our nations
<br>
in the first place.  A glance at early English history---or that
<br>
of *any* nation---will make my point.
<br>
<p>I do want to readily admit however, that these ancient drives
<br>
are not necessarily optimal for the future, and should be subject
<br>
to possible editing.  But the editing could go either way.  If
<br>
SAIs are borg-like, then evolution may cause them to be more
<br>
bellicose than their creators!
