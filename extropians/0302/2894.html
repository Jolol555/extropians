<em>&gt;        Having rid the Afghanistan of the Taliban you seem to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be taking on the additional burden of supporting them.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even a little thought will show that your analysis is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faulty. 
</em><br>
<p>Ron, let's for a moment assume that we just don't care about the
<br>
individuals who live in Afghanistan.  Let's set aside any and all
<br>
humanitarian concern or feeling of responsibility for them and just
<br>
talk realpolitik.
<br>
<p>Afghanistan has a history of instability and chaos that goes back 30
<br>
years.  Every government there has fallen apart as feuding factions
<br>
and warlords took control and turned the country into a war zone.  It
<br>
was this chaos that allowed the Taliban, who brought order, to come to
<br>
power.  
<br>
<p>From a purely selfish standpoint we don't want to allow such a thing
<br>
to happen again.  We want there to be a democratic, affluent, stable
<br>
society in Afghanistan, because societies like that create fewer
<br>
terrorists.
<br>
<p>So, you would think we would create a policy that would encourage such
<br>
a society to come into existence.  Now, so far we've spent around $15
<br>
Billion on the war in Afghanistan, and continue to spend around $1.8
<br>
Billion a month there on military deployment.  By contrast, we've
<br>
spent between $200 and $300 million on reconstruction and peace
<br>
keeping.  To me this seems quite short sighted.  It focuses resources
<br>
on the immediate crisis without investing in preventing the next
<br>
crisis.
<br>
<p>Currently the UN has a peace keeping force that patrols Kabul, the
<br>
capital of Afghanistan.  There are exactly 0 US personnel in this
<br>
peace keeping force.  Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan, has
<br>
repeatedly asked for a larger peace keeping force that can patrol the
<br>
entire country and help reign in the warlords.  His requests have been
<br>
denied.  He has also asked for US assistance in training an Afghan
<br>
police force and Afghan military that would be under the control of
<br>
the democratically elected government.  The US has denied these
<br>
requests as well.
<br>
<p>Frankly, Afghanistan is on a course for anarchy.  Only strong
<br>
investment in rebuilding and stabilizing that country will prevent
<br>
that.  And no one, and especially not the US, seems to be willing to
<br>
make that investment.
<br>
<p>With this kind a track record, I simply don't trust the US to do the
<br>
right thing in Iraq.
