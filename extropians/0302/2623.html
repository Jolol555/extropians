</em><br>
<p>For people who don't know me, I have been thinking about the issue of how
<br>
probability and decisions should work in a multiverse, ever since
<br>
Tegmark's 1998 paper came out. I've run a mailing list about multiverse
<br>
theories for the past 5 years where this issue has been discussed
<br>
frequently. There's a summary of my current approach posted at
<br>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/<a href="mailto:everything-list@eskimo.com?Subject=Re:%20Parallel%20Universes">everything-list@eskimo.com</a>/msg03812.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/<a href="mailto:everything-list@eskimo.com?Subject=Re:%20Parallel%20Universes">everything-list@eskimo.com</a>/msg03812.html</a>. The
<br>
current exchange with Eliezer was prompted by a problem I found in my own
<br>
post. Here's a quote from it:
<br>
<p>What should P be? Suppose the multiverse consists of all mathematical
<br>
structures (as proposed by Tegmark). In that case each element in S would
<br>
be a conjunction of mathematical statements and P would assign
<br>
probabilities to these mathematical statements (most of which we have no
<br>
hope of proving or disproving). How should we do that? Of
<br>
course we already do that (e.g. computer scientists bet with each other on
<br>
whether polytime = non-deterministic polytime, and we make use of
<br>
mathematical facts that we don't understand the proofs for), but
<br>
there does not seem to be a known method for doing it optimally. This is
<br>
also where anthropic reasoning would come in.
<br>
<p>The problem is the last sentence. In fact anthropic reasoning should NOT
<br>
be applied to P, because it would cause double counting. P has to come
<br>
from deterministic computation only.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My question is, doesn't this apply just as well to all other factual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data about the universe?  Take for example the first fractional bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pi.  The way binary fractions work, any fraction &lt; 1/2 has its first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit as 0.  Since pi's fractional part starts with .14159..., which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than 1/2, we know its first bit is 0.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or do we?  Isn't all reasoning inherently uncertain?  We don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this fact with perfect certainty.  There must be some chance of error -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one in a trillion, one in 10^100?
</em><br>
<p>If you don't have access to a deterministic computer (such as Egan's Qusp)  
<br>
then yes you have to say that the probability of the first bit of pi being
<br>
1 is also 1/2. I think the decision still comes out right in the end
<br>
because you'd also think that if the first bit of pi is 1, then your
<br>
current measure must be tiny and any bet you make on pi being 1 would lead
<br>
to reward for only a tiny measure of observers.
<br>
<p>Lack of access to deterministic computers actually make things even more
<br>
difficult than they already are, and I haven't worked out fully what
<br>
you're supposed to do when your own brain is unreliable hardware. Let's
<br>
assume that we do have deterministic brains to begin with. We can talk
<br>
about non-deterministic brains later when we've worked out the easier
<br>
case. So forget about the previous paragraph for now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given this, wouldn't Wei's Bayesian globalist have to say that the value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the first fractional bit of pi was still uncertain, that there was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 50-50 chance of it being 0 or 1?  And similarly, wouldn't he say the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same thing about every bit of pi, therefore that pi's value was completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertain?  And in fact, wouldn't this reasoning apply to every fact about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe?  Therefore every probability stays stuck at 0.5, or at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at some a priori probability distribution that was uninformed by facts.
</em><br>
<p>The probabilities wouldn't be stuck because they would depend on the
<br>
results of the deterministic computations you run. If run a new
<br>
computation then your probabilities would change as a result.
