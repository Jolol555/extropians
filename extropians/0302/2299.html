Don't despair, spike, I think there's still a chance for carbon, at
<br>
least for the next two or three years.  What we need is anti-computer
<br>
specialists, which Kasparov certainly isn't.  I must admit I was
<br>
surprised that Kramnik didn't beat Fritz, but there must be GMs in the
<br>
top 100 whose style would suit better against calculating monsters  (I
<br>
wouldn't mind seeing Karpov v Junior for example, or even Leko).  It
<br>
certainly is the end for aggressive players (eg Shirov would probably
<br>
get hammered).  
<br>
IMO, the coolest thing that came up from this match, was DJ's bishop
<br>
sacrifice in game 5.  I didn't see a computer doing that for another 5
<br>
years.
