</em><br>
<em>&gt; cock-eyed reasoning.&quot; -- Michelle Kamhi
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michelle Kamhi comments that she (?)
</em><br>
<p>She's a she.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; even likes some abstract art.  However, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems that she is reducing it to decorative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work by commenting about the elements of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; symbolism which is part and parcel to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract art as expressed by de Kooning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vassily Kandinsky, and Miro of the abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genre.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not so sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Abstract art, and all &quot;art&quot; cannot be meaningless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, it would not be &quot;art.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I think Kamhi would agree that art cannot be meaningless.  However, the
<br>
question here would be what kind of meaning does an abstract work have.
<br>
If it's purely symbolic, then it's more like a code than an art work.
<br>
The symbols in a code need bear no direct relation to their underlying
<br>
meaning.  An artistic image -- using &quot;image&quot; loosely to cover all art
<br>
forms from music to painting -- on the other must pretty much have a
<br>
direct relation, even if it's somewhat fuzzy or loose, to what it means.
<br>
A word, e.g., does not -- save for the case of onomotapoeia and that's
<br>
debatable:) -- represent the same way an art work does -- at least, not
<br>
a representational painting, say.  Words, in fact, seem only arbitrarily
<br>
related to the things they designate.  Art works do not -- again, not
<br>
representational paintings and sculptures and the like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further abstract art, like any &quot;art&quot; cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be immune from art criticism which is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiar to artists and art that to not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticisms would be foreign.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think Kamhi would disagree here.  After all, she was responding
<br>
to the other guy's comment here...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any open discussion and or critique of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; art, there is a tendency for rigid application
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and theory and sometimes an unwilling to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see the obvious.
</em><br>
<p>Just in art?:)  I think this is likely here, though I tend to side with
<br>
Kamhi.  A better way to approach this subject might be to select a bunch
<br>
of representative samples of art and try to find what they all have in
<br>
common and see if there are subcategories as well as what impact they
<br>
have on people.  Such a method might yield results none of suspected --
<br>
including me.  However, I'm not smart enough to figure how to do this,
<br>
so I'll just throw the idea out here for others to examine and maybe
<br>
use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;It is possible, in fact, that abstract art became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more appropriate as scientific insights became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more inclusive and abstract since the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disciplines often work in complimentary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accord.&quot; -- Kirk Hughey
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Excellent statement and I think Hughey makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the more percipient point.
</em><br>
<p>Kamhi's reply seems to find some problems with this view, though I don't
<br>
feel she completely refutes Hughey here.  For  the benefit of the others
<br>
she responds:
<br>
<p>&quot;Mr. Hughey suggests that the very &quot;multireferencial&quot; character of
<br>
abstract art is a virtue. When the viewer's references are completely at
<br>
odds with the artist's intent, however - as is so often the case with
<br>
abstract work (see the numerous cases cited in Chapter 8 of &quot;What Art
<br>
Is&quot; [her and Louis Torres' book on esthetics]) - the purported virtue
<br>
seems more like a vice.&quot;
<br>
(<a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/letters/20030208-3517.shtml">http://www.artsjournal.com/letters/20030208-3517.shtml</a>)
<br>
<p>I do feel she has weakened his case here a bit.  Also, it was not the
<br>
intention of most early Abstract artists to find such patterns.
<br>
Kandinsky was pretty much a mystic and looking for otherworldly things.
<br>
That said, an artist's intentions should not be the sole criterion for
<br>
judgment here.  I'll have to think on it some more...
<br>
<p>Cheers!
