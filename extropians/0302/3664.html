Hi Reason,
<br>
<p>Don't sweat it man, the human cloning thing was just a mirage anyway. Who
<br>
needs it? Who cares? Let the gov toss the right wingers this scrawny little
<br>
carrot to gnaw on and savor. Seems there are more roads to immortality than
<br>
you can shake a stick at, and the majority of them remain well below the
<br>
radars of the fearfully ignorant villagers. Spend the rest of the day in bed
<br>
with a willing female and create for our cause some reasonable, well rounded
<br>
rug rats. Nothing better than kids for teaching you to pick your battles
<br>
wisely.
<br>
<p>Russell Evermore

<p>Think you can, think you can't - either way you're right.
<br>
