Here is published evidence that selegiline (deprenyl) increases
<br>
life-expectancy in Parkinson's Disease, (something that Rafal considers
<br>
impossible.)
<br>
<p>In this 9 year study, 564 of  941 PD patients were given selegiline as part
<br>
of their treatment. The patients treated with selegiline lived significantly
<br>
longer than those not treated with selegiline. This is strong evidence that
<br>
selegiline actually slows the progression of the disease in addition to
<br>
relieving its symptoms. While these results were not confirmed by another
<br>
similar study, they can hardly be discounted given the preponderance of
<br>
evidence from other studies that support the hypothesis that selegiline has
<br>
neuroprotective and antioxidant properties outside of PD, including evidence
<br>
from those other studies I've already posted here over the last week. -gts

<p>ABSTRACT
<br>
Increased life expectancy resulting from addition of L-deprenyl to Madopar
<br>
treatment in Parkinson's disease: a longterm study.
<br>
<p>J Neural Transm 1985;64(2):113-27    (ISSN: 0300-9564)

<br>
In an open, uncontrolled study the longterm (9 years) effect of treatment
<br>
with Madopar alone (n = 377) or in combination with l-deprenyl (selegiline,
<br>
selective monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor) (n = 564) have been compared
<br>
in Parkinsonian patients. In patients who lost their response to
<br>
conventional Madopar therapy the addition of l-deprenyl resulted in a
<br>
significant recouping of levodopa effect. The survival analysis revealed a
<br>
significant increase of life expectancy in Madopar--l-deprenyl group
<br>
regardless of the fact whether or not the significant demographic
<br>
differences between the two groups were taken into account. Although the
<br>
mechanism underlying this action of l-deprenyl is not known, the results are
<br>
interpreted as indicating l-deprenyl's ability to prevent or retard the
<br>
degeneration of striatal dopaminergic neurons. l-Deprenyl is the first
<br>
anti-Parkinson drug having such a property. This hypothesis is not far
<br>
fetched since l-deprenyl selectively prevents the degeneration of striatal
<br>
dopaminergic neurons induced in animals by the illicit drug
<br>
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Since latter compound
<br>
is known to cause Parkinsonism in man and primates or Parkinson-like
<br>
neurochemical and pathological changes in other animals the implications of
<br>
the present study involving monoamine oxidase activity and l-deprenyl are
<br>
apparent.
