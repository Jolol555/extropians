<p>&quot;As it happens, I even like some abstract work - for its elements of color 
<br>
and design. In the light of the cognitive revolution, however, I find the 
<br>
extravagant claims for its meaningfulness, and for its ultimate cultural 
<br>
value, more and more unconvincing. The widely held notion that abstract art 
<br>
should henceforth be immune from all criticism because totalitarian 
<br>
dictators attempted to obliterate it is simply a case of cock-eyed reasoning.&quot;
<br>
-- Michelle Kamhi
<br>
<p>Michelle Kamhi comments that she (?) even likes some abstract 
<br>
art.  However, it seems that she is reducing it to decorative work by 
<br>
commenting about the elements of color and design.  She leaves out the 
<br>
symbolism which is part and parcel to abstract art as expressed by de 
<br>
Kooning, Vassily Kandinsky, and Miro of the abstract genre.  Abstract art, 
<br>
and all &quot;art&quot; cannot be meaningless.  If so, it would not be 
<br>
&quot;art.&quot;  Further abstract art, like any &quot;art&quot; cannot be immune from art 
<br>
criticism which is so familiar to artists and art that to not have 
<br>
criticisms would be foreign.
<br>
<p>In any open discussion and or critique of art, there is a tendency for 
<br>
rigid application and theory and sometimes an unwilling to see the obvious.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is possible, in fact, that abstract art became more appropriate as 
<br>
scientific insights became more inclusive and abstract since the two 
<br>
disciplines often work in complimentary accord.&quot; -- Kirk Hughey
<br>
<p>Excellent statement and I think Hughey makes the more percipient point.
