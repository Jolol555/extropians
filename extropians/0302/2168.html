<em>&gt; (Lee Corbin &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20Hazards%20of%20Coal%20Burning%20was%20RE:%20Hydrogen%20as%20SCAM?">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've always thought that figures such as these---three million---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do need to be adjusted for &quot;expected number of years of life lost&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is, although it's still a tragedy, the loss of an eighty-five
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year old ought not to be regarded with the sense of loss as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fifteen year old.  Their deaths (on the first reading) cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be equated because the eighty-five year old is nearly certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to die anyway shortly.
</em><br>
<p>Can I nominate this for the most un-extropian statement of the
<br>
month?  Perhaps the year?
<br>
<p>Death--all deaths, for any reason--are bad.  But if I am forced
<br>
to compare the loss of an 85-year-old to a 15-year-old, I would
<br>
think the former more tragic because more has been lost: more
<br>
knowledge, experience, wisdom; more friends and family and
<br>
working relationships.  The fact that the 85-year-old is likely
<br>
to die soon is not a premise to be reasoned from, it is the very
<br>
battle we are trying to fight.
<br>
