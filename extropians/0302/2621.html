<em>&gt; Actually, since the US road death toll has been DROPPING as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percentage for a number of years,
</em><br>
<p>The figures we have been discussing are the total numbers of traffic
<br>
deaths, which have been generally reducing in the OECD countries over
<br>
the last ten years. But *not* in the USA.
<br>
<p>The USA road deaths figures for 1991-2001 are:
<br>
1991  41,462
<br>
1992  39,236
<br>
1993  40,150
<br>
1994  40,716
<br>
1995  41,817
<br>
1996  42,065
<br>
1997  42,013
<br>
1998  41,501
<br>
1999  41,717
<br>
2000  41,821  = 15.2 per 100000 population
<br>
2001  42,116
<br>
2002  not available yet
<br>
<p>from <a href="http://www.oecd.org">http://www.oecd.org</a>
<br>
<p>There is a bit of fluctuation here, but the trend looks slightly
<br>
upwards, or level, to me. Almost every other OECD country has succeeded
<br>
in substantially reducing road deaths over the same period. If the USA
<br>
had achieved the same reductions as Canada, Australia or UK, then there
<br>
would have been about 15,000 fewer deaths in year 2000 in USA.
<br>
<p>You can play around with percentages of cars / population, miles driven,
<br>
journeys made, etc. if you like, but the USA is virtually the only OECD
<br>
country not currently reducing the death toll on its roads.

<br>
<em>&gt; The paramount contributor to traffic deaths in the US is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevalence of youth drivers with insufficient training, and elderly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drivers who hold onto drivers licenses long after they are no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physically able to be responsible drivers. Other countries are much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more strict about these two groups, which cause some 80% of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accidents.
</em><br>
<p>This is correct about young drivers, but a bit unfair to the old folk.
<br>
See: <a href="http://www.hwysafety.org/">http://www.hwysafety.org/</a>
<br>
'People 65 years and older represented 16 percent of the driving age
<br>
population in 2001 and were involved in 16 percent of fatal motor
<br>
vehicle crashes. This is largely due to their increased susceptibility
<br>
to injury, particularly chest injuries and medical complications, rather
<br>
than an increased tendency to get into crashes. Fragility begins to
<br>
increase at ages 60-64. At age 75, older drivers do begin to be markedly
<br>
overinvolved in crashes, but fragility is the predominant factor
<br>
explaining the elevated deaths per mile among older drivers.'
<br>
(As an aside, if Mike also wants to get rid of public transport
<br>
services, he isn't leaving much for the old folk).

<p>FATALITY FACTS as of November 2002
<br>
<a href="http://www.hwysafety.org/safety_facts/fatality_facts/general.htm">http://www.hwysafety.org/safety_facts/fatality_facts/general.htm</a>
<br>
This annual report gives a fascinating analysis of US traffic deaths,
<br>
cross-analysed under many different headings. This site provides many
<br>
reports on highway safety, even analysing by type of car.
<br>
<p>A few highlights:
<br>
Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among Americans
<br>
1-34 years old. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the
<br>
total societal cost of crashes exceeds $200 billion annually.
<br>
Contributing to the death toll are alcohol, speed, lack of belt use and
<br>
other problematic driver behaviors.
<br>
<p>Deaths in pickups and utility vehicles have more than doubled since
<br>
1975.
<br>
<p>Highest death rates in midsize sports cars: The vehicles with the
<br>
highest death rates are all sports cars -- the Chevrolet Camaro, Camaro
<br>
convertible, and Pontiac Firebird. These three models have very high
<br>
death rates in single-vehicle crashes, and this has been true model year
<br>
after model year (see Status Report, Oct. 9, 1996). The single-vehicle
<br>
death rates, including high rollover rates despite low centers of
<br>
gravity, reflect both the performance capabilities of the sports cars
<br>
and the risk-taking characteristics of many of their drivers.
