</em><br>
<p>(1) AFAIK, coal is not suitable for deadly weapons and therefore of no 
<br>
value for villains of any kind, including &quot;corrupt despotic theocratic 
<br>
murderous regimes&quot;.
<br>
<p>(2) Coal is almost no hazard for human health, except when swallowed or 
<br>
hit on the head and therefore doesn't have to be kept safe and secured 
<br>
at all times.
<br>
<p>(3) The by-products of coal mining can be put back without any hazard 
<br>
for the biosphere.
<br>
<p>(4) Coal ashes is not dangerous and does not need to be kept off our 
<br>
biosphere for thousands of years.
<br>
<p>(5) Even a very large malfunction in a coal fired power plant could not 
<br>
devastate a large area, cost millions of lives and billions of Euros 
<br>
(please read about the effects of Tschernobyl '86 in FSU and Europe).
<br>
<p>(6) An exploding LNG tanker may have the mechanical power of a small 
<br>
A-bomb, but it will not make the whole area inhabitable for years. BTW, 
<br>
what would you prefer as a terrorist attack, an oil tanker rammed into a 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;harbour at full speed, or an atomic bomb on the same area?
<br>
<p>All this results in much higher costs for nuclear power systems.
<br>
<p>If Uranium would be as inert and safe for the biosphere as coal or gas, 
<br>
and if the process from Uranium to energy and the disposal of the waste 
<br>
would be as safe as with coal or gas, I'd agree with you.
<br>
<p>Risk assessment calculates the probability of a risk multiplied by the 
<br>
cost of the consequences. An important factor for the latter is, how 
<br>
many people and their belongings (incl. industry) are affected. In 
<br>
Western-Europe, with its population density between 200 and 300 p/km^2 
<br>
(New York: 270), the consequences of only one greater nuclear accident 
<br>
outweight every catastrophy even large numbers of exploding coal plants 
<br>
could achieve :-)
<br>
<p>But I agree that burning fossil fuels is not very intelligent either. As 
<br>
long as we don't have any technology to predict/control the large scale 
<br>
effects of our actions, we are wise to reduce our influence on the 
<br>
ecosphere wherever possible. On the long run, we will have to develop 
<br>
sustainable technological systems on this planet, regardless of how 
<br>
complex and high-tech they may be.
