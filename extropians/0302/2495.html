<em>&gt; &gt; It all depends on the context within which you are making your comparisons.

<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The sense of self is an illusion.  Science has begun to show that our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense of self, which seems to us continuous and central, and -- important --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is actually a result of multiple asynchronous fed-back processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;sense of self&quot; is certainly NOT an illusion.  The actuality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be a different story or not what we sense that it is.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.   Though what Samantha has written so far is not, 
<br>
of course, an argument---merely an assertion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; What even most technophiles don't realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is that this sense of self is under constant revision, with memories lost,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and sometimes replaced with various degrees of inaccuracy, emotions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; changing, and even &quot;processing capability&quot; changing all the time.  The sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of self is an illusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is a cloud an &quot;illusion&quot;?  Is something that is constantly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shifting for that reason &quot;illusion&quot;?  If so, then what does it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter?  Matter itself is consistently shifting at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental level.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  Jef has not answered this point yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; What I find strange is that many people would generally agree with the above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paragraph, but then continue to think that preservation of this illusionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;self&quot; is an all-important goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So it does not matter to you if you die in the next nano-second, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heh?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  This point also has not been addressed adequately 
<br>
by those eager to assert that the self does not exist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now I do agree that it is quite essential to greatly loosen the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion of &quot;self&quot; if we are going to be able to change packaging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and characteristics radically.  Too much baggage defining the view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self is tied to the particulars of the current implementation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and its associated evolutionary programming.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have any problem with some versions of myself embracing
<br>
a &quot;greatly loosened&quot; concept of self.  In fact, I prefer it.
<br>
I don't even have any problem with some of us joining a group
<br>
mind.  Unlike Rafal, who finds that about equivalent to death,
<br>
to me, it would be just another form of experience---but 
<br>
experience too radical and too disturbing to my *present*
<br>
concept of self for all of my copies to accept.
<br>
<p>My insight here, which (sorry) I've been repeating many times
<br>
for ten years or more is that after one accepts that duplicates
<br>
are self, you can have your cake *and* eat it.  To wit, you can
<br>
explore multiple roads, even on local Earth.
<br>
<p>I have also proclaimed the following as &quot;the logic of cryonics&quot;:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We save others so that in time we may be saved;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give earlier versions of myself occasional
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;run time so that this version too shall receive.
