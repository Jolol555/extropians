<em>&gt; &gt;(I'd still like to know why the last US-invasion was stopped so soon.
</em><br>
<p>Two possible partial reasons:
<br>
<p>1. The US plays a double game, wanting some instability but no break-up of
<br>
Iraq into separate areas. A Kurdish State if all-inclusive would be bigger
<br>
than Iraq in population and Turkey and the rest are dead set against it, not
<br>
wanting to lose their Kurdish areas. The Kurds have seen empires rise and
<br>
fall of course.
<br>
<p>2. The US plays a double game and doesn't want the Shiite majority to assume
<br>
control in Iraq and link up to Iran.
<br>
<p>3. The US was worried about US casualties in Baghdad and elsewhere. Post
<br>
Sept 11, this is no longer a concern. (Saddam has armed local traditional
<br>
rulers with &quot;light&quot; arms.)
<br>
<p>Estimated US losses for 2003:
<br>
<p>100?
<br>
1000?
<br>
10000?
<br>
<p>Possibly equivalent to the UK in the Falklands?
