<p><em>&gt; (Russell Blackford &lt;<a href="mailto:rblackford@hotmail.com?Subject=RE:%20Anniversary%20of%20Roe%20v.%20Wade">rblackford@hotmail.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, this is the correct analysis. Whether such individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rights [such as a right to birth control] really can be read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into the US constitution is another thing...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's there to debate?  The ninth and tenth amendments are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plain, ordinary English.  What part of &quot;shall not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construed&quot; isn't clear?
</em><br>
<p>The ninth is a very short amendment, saying, 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enumeration within the Constitution shall
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not be construed to deny or disparage others
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retained by the people.
<br>
<p>On your very simple and clear reading &quot;the ordinary
<br>
English&quot; would appear to dictate that towns could not
<br>
even pass prohibitions against spitting on the sidewalk.
<br>
<p>Clearly, that is not what was meant or intended in any
<br>
way.  It would never have occurred to any usual reader
<br>
of the constitution that this forbade ordinances against
<br>
public nudity or the running of businesses on Sunday.
<br>
<p>This was clearly meant as a limit on *federal* power,
<br>
the new government that was being created.
<br>
<p>However, in your next post, you relent a little:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am perhaps willing to concede that it makes sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a larger community to do things like set standards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of commerce, or regulate behavior /among/ its citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But those powers which it makes sense for people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delegate to their community... are a very limited set,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and cannot possibly include personal intimate behaviors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are private and individual by their very nature.
</em><br>
<p>It is new to me, (showing what a great constitutional
<br>
scholar I am), and would possibly have been new to the
<br>
authors this fine distinction.  Very few acts have no
<br>
consequences for a district or community.  Certainly
<br>
&quot;conspiring&quot; with a doctor to kill a fetus (or failing
<br>
to appear in public properly dressed) have clear effects
<br>
on a community.  Deep traditions concerning marriage,
<br>
procreation, birthing, the treatment of one's children,
<br>
and so on and on, are surely involved.  So the questions
<br>
are quite intricate.
<br>
<p>What is clear and foremost is where the power should lie,
<br>
because power by its very nature---the use of force, after
<br>
all---is so critical.  It comes down to, as you have written,
<br>
&quot;the powers which it makes sense for a people to delegate
<br>
to their community&quot;.  Today the stark fact is that there
<br>
is too much government power, too much however you look at
<br>
it, either economically or socially.  The relaxation of
<br>
such power at the highest level---the federal government---
<br>
is what is most strongly called for at this time.
<br>
<p>Again, by no means do I wish for individual state governments,
<br>
nor local governments, to thereby actually *enact* unnecessary
<br>
infringements on liberty---and I see abortion as one of those,
<br>
because it's really not their business to get involved in a
<br>
private relationship between a woman, her family, and their
<br>
physicians.  But in getting government to &quot;butt out&quot;, I want
<br>
the highest levels out first.
<br>
