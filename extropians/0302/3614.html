<p>
Emlyn said most of what I would say, very eloquently. I would add that
<br>
current panics over terrorism only make sense if you put them into the wider
<br>
context that Emlyn describes. Another example is the intense fear of child
<br>
abduction and molestation. This has led to substantial changes in behaviour
<br>
here in Britain with considerable knock-on costs. It has also led quite
<br>
recently to a mob campaign stirred up by a tabloid paper which had it been
<br>
allowed to continue would have had tragic results sooner or later. As Emlyn
<br>
and Amara say, this kind of thinking is particularly alarming for anyone
<br>
with an extropian perspective, as the mindset that underlies it is hostile
<br>
to innovation (too risky/uncertain), to &quot;experiments in living&quot; of any kind,
<br>
and to social openness (seen as giving the bad guys too much room). I
<br>
understand what Lee is saying, I also know lots of people who are not
<br>
influenced by this climate of fear but I have to say I also know many who
<br>
*are*  and I can observe the effects it has around me. It certainly doesn't
<br>
help that some of our institutions, above all the legal system, amplify both
<br>
the visibility and impact of neurotic anxiety but it also suits many people.
