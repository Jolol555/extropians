I believe the author was stating that the greater resources are closer, at 
<br>
hand, on the ocean floor; while space colonization and exploration might cost 
<br>
trillions and will not happen soon, in any case. 
<br>
<p>Its an audacious opinion, by the author and engineer (Graham Hawkes) and the 
<br>
damned thing about it, looking at it from pure economic justification (which 
<br>
in itself is never pure) oceanic exploitation might be far more rewarding 
<br>
over the next 300 years, then the solar system (no bets!).
<br>
<p>I did not take the meaning of the author to believe that we need extract HE³ 
<br>
for fusion reactors, from the ocean floor; but I suspect, that Hawkes must 
<br>
have meant methane gas hydrates, which exist in fantastic amounts, if the 
<br>
estimates are accurate. He is also gung-ho for extremophiles for use in 
<br>
biotechnology and medicine. 
<br>
<p>For someone like myself, who has been a space nut since I was a preschooler; 
<br>
its odd finding myself siding with the author. I think I will just lay down 
<br>
till the feeling goes away.

<em>&gt; Yes, although I doubt subsea He3 mining will ever be

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Space is important because it is *space*. For

</em><br>
<p>That's exactly the attitude they're attacking, though
<br>
I believe their attack to be flawed.  Almost all of
<br>
their criticisms can be traced to the way we have
<br>
attempted to go to space - for instance, NASA - rather
<br>
than the potential of space itself.  Had something
<br>
like NASA been in place with regards to Earth's
<br>
oceans for the past 40 years, I dare say there would
<br>
be a flag and a few more pieces of junk at the deepest
<br>
point of the Earth's oceans, but nobody would have yet
<br>
come near the Titanic, for example, though some
<br>
multi-billion dollar plans to do so would have been
<br>
floated.
<br>
<p>Which is not to say that oceanic applications of
<br>
science could not use more investigation.  For
<br>
instance, robot deep sea submarines (or even sea floor
<br>
crawlers) to hunt for significant concentrations of
<br>
certain valuable minerals and/or energy.  Or possibly
<br>
research into cheap but durable aquatic residences, to
<br>
allow population pressures in certain coastal cities
<br>
to be partially eased by expanding into the sea, while
<br>
still keeping people relatively close to the trade
<br>
hubs that are their reason for living near the cities
<br>
in the first place..&gt;&gt;
