<p><em>&gt; I've never read in a history book of an invaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land...and I mean close enough proximity to see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where people were holding a peace protest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not scrambling for their lives.  Am I wrong?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Athens in the Peloponnesian War:
<br>
<p>While Spartan forces were marauding the countryside
<br>
around Athens, the asshole Socrates and others were
<br>
saying everything pro-Sparta that they could think
<br>
of.  A certain playwright was advocating peace and
<br>
disarmament in his theatrical productions.
<br>
<p>The worst crime of it was that a number of people
<br>
were listening to Socrates, and applauding those
<br>
productions, and this at a time when Spartan
<br>
tyranny was well-known.  So next time some loony
<br>
leftist seems to be going beyond all reason, just
<br>
remember that so did &quot;the wisest of them all&quot;.
<br>
<p>Alas, some people's emotions, healthy prejudices,
<br>
and natural human common sense are simply broken.
<br>
