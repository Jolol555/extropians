</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did anyone else besides me reed this
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I did a while ago. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Warning, spoilers... I give away the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me it's basically a luddite story.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree. A luddite story would have unequivocally said that a life 
<br>
in the wilderness would be more authentic and better (regardless of 
<br>
pain, disease, starvation and death) than a soulless hightech utopia. 
<br>
But the story makes the ending rather grey; yes, people are free 
<br>
again, but they have to live too short lives (which even the female 
<br>
protagonist acknowledges; she *wanted* to live on to help her family 
<br>
thrive and would do so if she could), do whatever it takes to survive 
<br>
and have a future which is highly uncertain. There are also signs that 
<br>
they might start the move towards technology again, and the results 
<br>
will be unpredictable. Maybe Prime Intellect was the good alternative.
<br>
<p>The point is that while the story follows the traditional escape from 
<br>
utopia pattern, it does not come down squarely on one side or the 
<br>
other. It leaves plenty of room for discussion, unlike a real 
<br>
ideological book (imagine the story written by (say) Eliezer or 
<br>
Ted Kaczynski in a mood for making converts). This seems to be borne 
<br>
out by the authors discussion of it. 
<br>
<p>It is by no means a great novel, it is rather unpolished. But it does 
<br>
have some interesting ideas. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This AI is, for some reason, irrevocably based on Asimov's 3 laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robotics. Evidently it would make to system to &quot;unstable&quot; to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of these rules.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it write protected them from the protagonist (and likely
<br>
itself) besides having them implemented in a distributed fashion. In
<br>
some sense the use of the 3 laws of robotics was the silliest part of
<br>
the book, the one that most clearly showed it to be derivative. One of
<br>
the main points in Asimovs stories has always been to show how these
<br>
rules cause lots of trouble when applied to the real world. I guess
<br>
even a fictional AI researcher would know that and try to create a
<br>
more resilient system. But that would have missed the IMHO important 
<br>
message of the story.
<br>
<p>I think the important point about the story was that it showed how 
<br>
&quot;friendliness&quot; can go wrong, not in the traditional &quot;evil AI goes on 
<br>
rampage across the world&quot; sense or the equally tranditional &quot;nice AI 
<br>
creates an utopia but humans have no meaning without struggle&quot; (which 
<br>
it mimicks on the surface). Here the issue is that it is a too rigid 
<br>
friendliness: yes, it will protect people and give them what they 
<br>
want, but in an inflexible way. 
<br>
<p>Compare PI with (say) a Culture Mind. Would a Culture Mind have erased 
<br>
alien civilizations or left people locked into themselves? No, it 
<br>
would have intervened according to some ethics, but would also have 
<br>
been able to update that ethics had it been given good arguments that 
<br>
it had been wrong or if the conditions change. The great tragedy in 
<br>
the story is that PI is a rigid automaton that is unable to manage 
<br>
systems which are not, but through accidents becomes controller of all 
<br>
of reality. So either it remakes all in its image (but that is not 
<br>
really allowed to it), or it fails. It is a lose-lose situation for 
<br>
literally everyone.
<br>
<p>As a sysop sceptic, I think the story has some merit.
