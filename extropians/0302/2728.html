Perhaps even cynical, liberal, journalists believe that a truely evil regime 
<br>
as Saddam's must be replaced? Perhaps that when 3000 Americans die, we now 
<br>
seek regime changes, where attitude changes seem unlikely? Perhaps in a world 
<br>
where proliferation has become a watchword, there needs to be a bully on the 
<br>
block to better ensure American safety? Perhaps, there is also French and 
<br>
German complicity in selling Saddam industrial goodies to help keep him a 
<br>
player, in a global arms race? And Peter Arnett's views about Saddam are 
<br>
well-known, and he doesn't seem to disapprove. 
<br>
<p><p><p>Dr. Graps stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;One of the programs I remember particularly well was a Thursday
<br>
evening talk show of an intense discussion with ~6
<br>
politicians/political party people and one journalist: Peter Arnett.
<br>
They were (of course) discussing the possible war in Iraq, and trying
<br>
to understand the Bush administration motivations for such a war. At
<br>
one point Arnett said: &quot;You know you would never see such a discussion
<br>
as this on American TV.&quot;
<br>
<p>He's right, you know. So why not? Why is the current narrative of
<br>
the U.S. media in Bush's back pocket, if policies are forged that
<br>
affects everyone's (U.S. citizen's and others) lives? Who is paying
<br>
for that narrative?&gt;&gt;
