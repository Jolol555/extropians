<p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Moreover, wind farms are incredibly land intensive. Three newly proposed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wind farms in West Virginia would occupy 30 to 40 square miles but would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce slightly less electricity than a new 265 MW gas-fired 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combined-cycle generating plant, which would occupy a few acres. 
</em><br>
<p>This is misleading.
<br>
<p>True....wind farms can take up vast areas.  However...think of a wind farm as 
<br>
analogous to a multi-canopy  jungle.  For example...the King Mountain Wind 
<br>
Ranch in West Texas.  One canopy (or tier)  might be the wind 
<br>
turbines....which extract energy from several hundred feet above the plateau. 
<br>
&nbsp;At ground level is the cattle ranch which continues unchanged...unaffected 
<br>
by the metal towers....the cattle just wander between them...unimpressed (In 
<br>
Kansas and Iowa the farmers steer their tractors around them....they ARE 
<br>
impressed however...by the lease revenues....which in some cases DOUBLES  
<br>
their per/acre income. And finally there is the subterranean income....the 
<br>
King Mountain wind ranch also has it's own oil and gas  production.
<br>
<p>So we have three levels....none interfering with the other....all generating 
<br>
revenue for the land owner.
<br>
<p>Not bad for what was once considered useless desert
<br>
<p>This cannot be said for a conventional power plant.....Like the one near Gila 
<br>
Bend Arizona.  Or of a nuke like the one near tonopah Az.   All that acerage 
<br>
is of exclusive use.
