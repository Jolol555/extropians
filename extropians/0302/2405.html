Everything indicates a FASI or other SI will discover most of the physics
<br>
of the this-universe underlying-TOE in 2 decades, possibly with final
<br>
refinements in the decades following, depending on the Fermi Paradox.
<br>
<p>This does not necessarily mean an end to design/analysis in physics.
<br>
<p>There are those who hold that theory is a case of &quot;best approximation&quot;
<br>
which approaches reality.
<br>
<p>There are those who hold that theory is a case of &quot;every instance is
<br>
wrong&quot; prior to the final truth.
<br>
<p>There are those who note that understood structures have become finer
<br>
and finer. This is the level where the Singularity becomes most evident
<br>
when these are graded by time and scale.

<em>&gt; When one wonders about &quot;reputable&quot; theories versus &quot;fringe&quot; theories, it
</em><br>

</em><br>
science
<br>

</em><br>
fatally
<br>
<em>&gt; flawed in a number of different ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is, we know that, as currently stated, its wrong. Since documentaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and teachers alike prefer to teach a mature theory (even a wrong one) than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admit to ignorance, the Big Bang still gets taught.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, that doesn't mean that any fringe theory is as good as any other, or
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternate theories.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One thing that I try to remind myself whenever I write science fiction, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that todays best theories are tomorrow's laughing stock. Its perfectly
</em><br>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pete: &quot;Can you believe they used to think that the universe was FINITE and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; EXPLODED into existance???!!!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John: Be fair, they hadn't even invented the gravistator yet. How were
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; supposed to measure the deep structure of the quantum foam? Without that,
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; assumption of an initial explosion was as reasonable as any other...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I remember a TV documentary a few years back that talked about the current
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Are you kidding? This is a GREAT time to be a cosmologist. Someone needs
</em><br>
to
<br>

first
