<em>&gt; Abstract art is full of verbal hallucination as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a genre of poetry in painting - symbolism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the lines and the spaces.
</em><br>
<p>There is a line though that when something becomes so devoid of any
<br>
objective meaning, that few people -- save for maybe some small clique
<br>
or club -- could understand it.  That line might be fuzzy, but I believe
<br>
most Abstract Art is well over it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Abstract art, and all &quot;art&quot; cannot be meaningless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; If so, it would not be &quot;art.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think Kamhi would agree that art cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; meaningless.  However, the question here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would be what kind of meaning does an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; abstract work have.  If it's purely symbolic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; then it's more like a code than an art work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even poetry is written in code.  The pictoglypics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented a symbolic world of code - images
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and shapes, forms and lines that represented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningful thoughts.
</em><br>
<p>Actual poetry, though, really relies on both the symbolic meaning
<br>
(meaning of words, phrases, sentence, etc.) and the aural meaning
<br>
contained in meter and other sound effects of poetry.  A poetry lacking
<br>
the latter would collapse into prose.  A poetry lacking the former
<br>
would, at best, be nonsense verse.
<br>
<p>Literature -- in which poetry is contained -- too, is a special case,
<br>
since unlike the other the other arts it does rely on words directly to
<br>
convey meaning.  So, I would not generalize -- as Rand often did -- from
<br>
literature to the other arts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The symbols in a code need bear no direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; relation to their underlying meaning.  An
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; artistic image -- using &quot;image&quot; loosely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cover all art forms from music to painting --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on the other must pretty much have a direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; relation, even if it's somewhat fuzzy or loose,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to what it means. A word, e.g., does not --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; save for the case of onomotapoeia and that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; debatable:) -- represent the same way an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; art work does -- at least, not a representational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; painting, say.  Words, in fact, seem only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; arbitrarily related to the things they designate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Art works do not -- again, not representational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; paintings and sculptures and the like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Art - whether music and its codes, or picture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and its shapes, or dance and its steps - usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is perceived mentally in images - abstract or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representational.
</em><br>
<p>The difference between representational art and Abstract Art in
<br>
painting, to stick with one kind of art, though is one need not
<br>
understand any special code to get the work.  Also, even in
<br>
representational works where symbols are used, they are usually not
<br>
private codes, but very public shared ones, such as crosses and the
<br>
like.
<br>
<p>Also, I'd like to make another comment on this:
<br>
<p>&quot;It is possible, in fact, that abstract art became more appropriate as
<br>
scientific insights became more inclusive and abstract since the two
<br>
disciplines often work in complimentary accord.&quot; -- Kirk Hughey
<br>
<p>You observed:  &quot;Excellent statement and I think Hughey makes the more
<br>
percipient point.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hughey's statement fits very well into the rhetoric of Extropianism and
<br>
transhumanism, but can you recover the &quot;scientific insights&quot; and the
<br>
like that a particular Abstract Painting deals with?  What does, e.g.,
<br>
one of Rothko's late canvasses tell us that is so &quot;inclusive&quot; that no
<br>
representational work could us the same?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thanks for your reply.
</em><br>
<p>Likewise!
<br>
