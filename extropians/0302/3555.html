<p>News in Science 26/2/2003 Earth bids farewell to remote Pioneer
<br>
spacecraft
<br>
<p><p>Earth has bid its final farewell to the Pioneer 10 spacecraft more
<br>
than 30 years after the probe set off for the outer regions of our
<br>
solar system.
<br>
<p>The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced
<br>
earlier today that it had received Pioneer's last signal in January, and
<br>
said it would no longer track the now remote object.
<br>
<p>&quot;After it passed Mars on its long journey into deep space, it was
<br>
venturing into places where nothing built by humanity had ever gone
<br>
before,&quot; said Colleen Hartman, director of NASA's solar system exploration
<br>
division. &quot;It ranks among the most historic as well as the most
<br>
scientifically rich exploration missions ever undertaken.&quot;
<br>
<p>Pioneer 10, one of a series of unmanned space probes, was launched in 1972
<br>
to study the outer planets of the solar system. It was the first to go
<br>
through the asteroid belt a doughnut-shaped ring between Earth and Mars
<br>
some 280 million km wide and 80 million km thick. It travels at speeds of
<br>
up to 72,000 kph and ranges in size from dust particles to rock chunks as
<br>
big as Alaska.
<br>
<p>The craft was also the first to send back pictures of Saturn and Jupiter
<br>
from close-up, and the first to go beyond Pluto, the furthestmost planet
<br>
known.
<br>
<p>NASA last received a signal back from Pioneer 10 on January 22 from a
<br>
distance of 12.2 billion km - 82 times the distance between the Earth and
<br>
the Sun. It took the very faint radio signal 11 hours and 20 minutes to
<br>
get home, traveling at the speed of light.
<br>
<p>&quot;Originally designed for a 21-month mission, Pioneer 10 exceeded all
<br>
expectations and lasted more than 30 years,&quot; said project manager Larry
<br>
Lasher of NASA's Ames Research Centre in California. &quot;It was a workhorse
<br>
that far exceeded its warranty, and I guess you could say we got our
<br>
money's worth.&quot;
<br>
<p>However, Pioneer is not the most remote human-made object. Voyager 1,
<br>
launched at a higher velocity in 1977, is 87 times the distance between
<br>
the Earth and Sun in another direction, said Pioneer 10 flight director
<br>
David Lozier. Voyager 1 is still sending back signals.
<br>
<p>Although it seems that Pioneer 10 does not have any power to send any more
<br>
signals to Earth, it will keep traveling for many years to come unless it
<br>
runs into something. It's next destination is the red giant star
<br>
Aldebaran, located in the eye of the constellation Taurus the Bull. The
<br>
trip is expected to take two million years.
<br>
<p>If alien life were to ever open Pioneer 10, they would find a gold plaque
<br>
with the image of a woman and a man and goodwill information about Earth.
<br>
&quot;It theoretically could be picked up if there is some intelligence out
<br>
there,&quot; Lozier said.
