<p>
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky  asked, &quot;Has anyone else begun to get the feeling 
<br>
that, wherever you go, you are there to represent the Net groupmind?&quot;
<br>
<p>I had a similar experience. I used Netscape 4.7 for archiving my email 
<br>
and recently switched to 7.01. I also sometimes send messages from 
<br>
Netscape when I am not using MUTT. Anyway, I did a MS upgrade and 
<br>
Netscape could no longer open up a new &quot;compose&quot; window. After deleting 
<br>
and reinstalling the code and considering Netscapes &quot;paid&quot; support 
<br>
services, I searched on the error message in Google.
<br>
<p>I found the bug log for the code and read about many peoples experience 
<br>
related to several different bugs with the same error. The net result 
<br>
was that many people had added a new account and that fixed things. I 
<br>
added a new (bogus) email account to Netscape and that fixed it..
<br>
<p>So yes, as Eliezer spoke about, I was able read and learn about a 
<br>
problem outside my own &quot;ken.&quot; For me it was magical in the sense that I 
<br>
would never have guessed the correct solution.
