</em><br>
<p>Abstract art is full of verbal hallucination as it is a genre of poetry in 
<br>
painting - symbolism between the lines and the spaces.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Abstract art, and all &quot;art&quot; cannot be meaningless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If so, it would not be &quot;art.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think Kamhi would agree that art cannot be meaningless.  However, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question here would be what kind of meaning does an abstract work have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If it's purely symbolic, then it's more like a code than an art work.
</em><br>
<p>Even poetry is written in code.  The pictoglypics represented a symbolic 
<br>
world of code - images and shapes, forms and lines that represented 
<br>
meaningful thoughts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The symbols in a code need bear no direct relation to their underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meaning.  An artistic image -- using &quot;image&quot; loosely to cover all art
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forms from music to painting -- on the other must pretty much have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;direct relation, even if it's somewhat fuzzy or loose, to what it means.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A word, e.g., does not -- save for the case of onomotapoeia and that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;debatable:) -- represent the same way an art work does -- at least, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a representational painting, say.  Words, in fact, seem only arbitrarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;related to the things they designate.  Art works do not -- again, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;representational paintings and sculptures and the like.
</em><br>
<p>Art - whether music and its codes, or picture and its shapes, or dance and 
<br>
its steps - usually is perceived mentally in images - abstract or 
<br>
representational.
<br>
<p>Coincidentally net.art of today is painted or composed in algorithmic code. :-)
<br>
<p>Thanks for your reply.
<br>
