In a message dated 2/17/2003 12:59:38 AM Central Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:oregan.emlyn@healthsolve.com.au?Subject=Re:%20Giant%20anti-war%20demonstration%20in%20Melbourne">oregan.emlyn@healthsolve.com.au</a> writes: Wait a second... the US has weapons 
<br>
of mass destruction (and seems to want them),&quot;
<br>
##Emlyn, please don't make such unfounded charges without any evidence.  Of 
<br>
course I do understand why you wouldn't offer evidence of that charge -- 
<br>
there isn't any.  On the other hand there is a great deal of evidence that 
<br>
the US doesn't want to drop WMDs.  This list has moments when we get a little 
<br>
rowdy but for the most part folks voluntarily restrict themselves to a 
<br>
mannerly presentation of evidence and logical argument.  You can do that 
<br>
can't you?
<br>
<p>You continue, &quot;has invaded its neighbours,&quot;
<br>
## Gee, and the Mexicans &amp; Canadians haven't said a single word about that.  
<br>
Where, when, &amp; what are you talking about Emlyn?  Are you discussing Germany 
<br>
during the Second World War?  Are you talking about when we made the drug 
<br>
bust in Panama?  Or are you discussing when we took the anti aircraft weapons 
<br>
away from the construction workers in Grenada that were threatening our 
<br>
medical students?
<br>
<p>You continue again, &quot;is fairly experienced at trying to control the world's 
<br>
supply of oil,&quot;
<br>
##Now you inserted enough modifiers in that sentence that it is hard to 
<br>
decide if you really meant what you said or not.  Like other countries the US 
<br>
has tried to bargain down the price of oil.  But, what I don't get is this -- 
<br>
you are perceptive enough to notice all the things the evil rascally US has 
<br>
done wrong and still you didn't notice that the US had effectively occupied 
<br>
Saudi Arabia during the First Gulf War.  Then when the reason for their being 
<br>
invited there had been accomplished the US loaded up and departed.  Imagine 
<br>
that, they had the oil supply of Saudi Arabia right under their thumbs and 
<br>
they gave it back without delay and without discussion?  Of course a fact 
<br>
like that wouldn't make it through your &quot;selectometer&quot; would it?
<br>
<p>You continued yet again, &quot;and has used chemical weapons on at least its own 
<br>
troops and certainly on the citizens of other countries (think Vietnam).&quot;
<br>
##Yes, I remember going through gas mask training three times during my 
<br>
tenure 
<br>
in the Navy.  I imagine others had the same experience.  To convince us that 
<br>
we really were in tear gas they made us remove our masks; march to the front 
<br>
of the room, recite name, rank and serial number; and then march out of the 
<br>
room.  If you rushed at any point you had to go to the rear of the line and 
<br>
wait without a mask.  Stories have been repeated that to get Viet Cong out of 
<br>
tunnels the US used the same gases we use on criminals in this country.  You 
<br>
evidently thought we would be ever so much nicer if we had killed them 
<br>
instead of getting them to surrender.
<br>
<p>Then you wrote this, &quot;I'm sure other countries would fit that bill, too. 
<br>
North Korea would probably fit rather well if it had oil, which is morally 
<br>
equivalent unless you propose that having power over some of the world's oil 
<br>
is somehow morally damning.&quot;
<br>
##Emlyn, I don't know what you were trying to say in that last little bit.  
<br>
Please take it back and rewrite it.
<br>
Ron h.
