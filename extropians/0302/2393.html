<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;I've read through your essay on
</em><br>
qualia but I'm going to have to read it
<br>
again and think about it some more to
<br>
understand how it fits.  To me, the
<br>
idea of qualia implies a recursively
<br>
nested &quot;Cartesian theater&quot;  scenario,
<br>
requiring at each level a homunculus to
<br>
observe the play.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p><p>Thank you for reading my paper!  I do
<br>
cover this in the paper.  This view is
<br>
not the &quot;Cartesian theater&quot; since there
<br>
is no observer in a theater.  The
<br>
representation of the information is
<br>
simply what the person consciously
<br>
knows.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;If take a look at the behavior of a
</em><br>
complex system with multiple feedback
<br>
loops, you might feel that it is
<br>
amazingly responsive to it's
<br>
environment,
<br>
but you won't necessarily find any
<br>
one-to-one mapping or representation of
<br>
the outside world within the system
<br>
begin examined.  You could try to build
<br>
it that way, but it wouldn't be
<br>
efficient, and at the lowest level the
<br>
mapping wouldn't hold true.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Yes, this is one point of view.  There
<br>
are many intelligent people that would
<br>
agree with this.  But it is my opinion
<br>
that this view is wrong and not
<br>
applicable to us.  We have very rich
<br>
conscious representations that map very
<br>
closely to the reality we are aware of.
<br>
Everything we know is not the object
<br>
itself, but our conscious representation
<br>
of it.  It is my opinion that accurate
<br>
representations are the most efficient
<br>
at being intelligent in versatile and
<br>
creative ways.  If an intelligent being
<br>
knows something, there is something that
<br>
is part of him that is that knowledge.
<br>
The more this knowledge deviates from
<br>
accurate representations, the more
<br>
problems this intelligence will
<br>
experience when it comes to dealing with
<br>
the world in creative ways...
<br>
<p>I pretty much agree with the rest of
<br>
what you said.
<br>
<p>Brent Allsop
