<p>He was sentenced to the maximum penalty possible under the law, in
<br>
the notable absence of firm proof.  I'm at a loss what more favorable
<br>
outcome, from your point of view, you could have expected.
<br>
<p>I don't have the court proceedings, but from what I picked up in the
<br>
press the charges rested on these facts to which the accused readily
<br>
admitted:
<br>
- He was friends with the guys of the Mohammed Atta terrorist cell.
<br>
- He shared an appartment with them for some time.
<br>
- He transferred some money for them.
<br>
- He has been to an Al-Quaida bootcamp in Afghanistan.
<br>
Also, he is known to have expressed violently anti-Jewish sentiments
<br>
in the past.
<br>
<p>None of this constitutes damning evidence.  The personal relationship
<br>
is perfectly compatible with just being friends with some fellow
<br>
students, without being privy to their conspiracy.  Also, a key
<br>
testimony was withheld from the court.  This case is likely to make
<br>
the revision circuits and it is within the realm of possibility
<br>
that Motassadeq might be cleared of all charges at the next level.
<br>
<p>I certainly find the prospect of being charged as a terrorist just
<br>
because you have unpopular opinions and happen to know some Arab
<br>
students quite terrifying.
<br>
<p>(Mind you, I share the suspicion that Motassadeq was deeply involved
<br>
in the whole thing, but accusation does not constitute proof.  At
<br>
least in modern judicial systems.)
