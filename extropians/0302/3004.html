<a href="mailto:mez@apexnano.com?Subject=Re:%20spreading%20democracy%20(was:%20Bush%20budget%20has%200%20dollars%20for%20Afghanistan)">mez@apexnano.com</a> writes: The rise of fundamentalist Islam in Iran can be 
<br>
directly traced to our support of a regime that repressed the people and left 
<br>
fundamentalist Islamic groups as the few willing and able to resist the 
<br>
dictator we'd installed.
<br>
<p>Is it really?  I know we did participate in the rise of the Shah to some 
<br>
extent.  But are you underestimating the deep desire of Moslems for a state 
<br>
that is ruled by Moslem law.  I know some pretty moderate Moslems that deeply 
<br>
and sincerely believe that Moslem law is superior to secular rule.  Have you 
<br>
noticed that the Moslem countries almost invariably split between a strongman 
<br>
dictator and Moslem law.  If any of the Moslem countries have secular 
<br>
governments I am not entirely certain of that fact.  I hear that Turkey does. 
<br>
&nbsp;Perhaps that is true.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I go to my moderate Moslem friends and we discuss that area I 
<br>
missed a point for a long time.  For example, when I pointed out that the 
<br>
reigning Pakistani government was a dictator they shrugged and were totally 
<br>
accepting of his reign.  I finally got the point.  They seem to visualize 
<br>
governments as either dictatorships or as Moslem law.  When we discuss Saudi 
<br>
government they become ecstatic over what a great Moslem the King is and all 
<br>
the things he does that proves he is an humble believing Moslem.  I don't 
<br>
argue with them as it is their country we are discussing and they can govern 
<br>
it anyway they wish to, but it is obvious that a democratic secular 
<br>
government is a total nonstarter.  They don't even seem to conceive of the 
<br>
possibility of ruling themselves.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going to happen?  I notice that Mohammed was born roughly six 
<br>
hundred years after Jesus.  When I look at their religious expression I seem 
<br>
to draw an equivalence with where we were about six hundred years ago.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition according to what I read this globe called Earth has two 
<br>
mass movements underway.  First, we seem to have an approaching spike or 
<br>
singularity.  Second there is some evidence that we are in the early stages 
<br>
of another renaissance.  I believe that Thomas Eastman's Lexus and the Olive 
<br>
Tree is one expression of the renaissance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hope is that out of the turmoil of a renaissance or the singularity 
<br>
we will be able to spread the memes to find peace.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem to argue with Mez about Afghanistan but I do believe he is 
<br>
asking the right questions.  If I understand him correctly he is asking about 
<br>
an &quot;exit strategy.&quot;  Mez has his own ideas &amp; that is fine.  In my own 
<br>
opinion, having people kill us is also a non-starter.  In my effort to get 
<br>
along with Moslems I take a cue straight out of Thomas Merton.  &quot;If we start 
<br>
to contrast Islam and Christianity and try to figure out which is right we 
<br>
can keep a fight going forever.  If we get down to cases and simply ask how 
<br>
do you do this, what is your view on this, without an attempt to refute or 
<br>
debate each other we can both learn.&quot;  I put that in quotes because I do say 
<br>
that in discussion.  I haven't been rejected yet for saying so.  If 
<br>
Christianity doesn't suit you you can substitute Eastern &amp; Western or any 
<br>
phrase you please.
<br>
