<p>
I have been following the discussion between Wei and Eliezer with great
<br>
interest.  The issue of how probability and decisions should work in the
<br>
context of parallel universes is quite difficult.  Tegmark alludes to
<br>
this in the last section of his paper.  I know Wei and have had several
<br>
discussions with him on this topic but I still have difficulty fully
<br>
grasping his approach.
<br>
<p>In the case of the millionth bit of pi, Wei argues that from a certain
<br>
perspective, getting information about the value (with a certain intrinsic
<br>
error) does not change your estimation of the value - you still see it
<br>
as being 0 or 1 with 50-50 probability.  This is of course quite counter-
<br>
intuitive but Wei shows that if you don't reason like this, you get the
<br>
wrong answer in your Bayesian calculations.
<br>
<p>My question is, doesn't this apply just as well to all other factual
<br>
data about the universe?  Take for example the first fractional bit
<br>
of pi.  The way binary fractions work, any fraction &lt; 1/2 has its first
<br>
bit as 0.  Since pi's fractional part starts with .14159..., which is
<br>
less than 1/2, we know its first bit is 0.
<br>
<p>Or do we?  Isn't all reasoning inherently uncertain?  We don't know
<br>
this fact with perfect certainty.  There must be some chance of error -
<br>
one in a trillion, one in 10^100?
<br>
<p>Given this, wouldn't Wei's Bayesian globalist have to say that the value
<br>
of the first fractional bit of pi was still uncertain, that there was
<br>
a 50-50 chance of it being 0 or 1?  And similarly, wouldn't he say the
<br>
same thing about every bit of pi, therefore that pi's value was completely
<br>
uncertain?  And in fact, wouldn't this reasoning apply to every fact about
<br>
the universe?  Therefore every probability stays stuck at 0.5, or at least
<br>
at some a priori probability distribution that was uninformed by facts.
<br>
<p>This seems to make &quot;probability&quot; a rather meaningless concept in this
<br>
model, or at least it seems to have a different meaning than what we
<br>
usually think of it.  Maybe &quot;a priori probability&quot; or &quot;initial bias&quot;
<br>
would be a better word for it?
<br>
