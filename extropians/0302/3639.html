</em><br>
<p>Ja.  My comments were spurred by the Nova program.  I
<br>
ordinarily never think about subways.  I seldom ride one,
<br>
for I don't live or work in a big city.
<br>
<p>After I posted about the vulnerability of a subway system,
<br>
I began second guessing the wisdom of discussing publicly
<br>
such matters.  Then a good friend read my mind and suggested
<br>
I cork it, forthwith.  This brings us back around to another
<br>
thread of a few weeks ago, the one about scientists
<br>
refraining from discussing technologies that could be used
<br>
to harm mankind.
<br>
<p>That being said, I will go off on a tangent of sorts.  My
<br>
scenario was one of mass disruption, a short-lived isotope
<br>
that is easily available, relatively cheap, legal, at least
<br>
temporarily indistinguishable from lethal radiation sources,
<br>
but one that does not actually cause any deaths.  My notion
<br>
is that subways in particular are inherently undefendable
<br>
from such attacks.
<br>
<p>As for the more serious attackers that really wish to
<br>
cause harm, the subway is far more vulnerable to firebombing
<br>
than a train, because the tunnel traps heat, the wreckage
<br>
is inherently difficult to remove, and in a subway tunnel
<br>
it is far more difficult to evacuate the survivors.
<br>
<p>There *may* be a way to make a subway train entirely
<br>
from nonflammables.  However, as time moves forward,
<br>
societies with incompatible premises are brought into
<br>
ever closer contact.  Luddites and extremists have ever
<br>
greater power to tear down society and disrupt progress.
<br>
That is why I made the prediction that within a decade,
<br>
the world's subway systems will be rendered useless.
<br>
<p>That being said, I suggest that such a fate is not the
<br>
end of progress as we know it, for the Silicon Valley
<br>
is a prime example of an extended suburb that supports
<br>
plenty of technological innovation with few mass transit
<br>
systems or sky scrapers.  A total disruption of BART, the
<br>
local subway, would scarcely be noticed, for its ridership
<br>
has never been high.
<br>
<p>The obstructionists, terrorists, the McVeighs,
<br>
Bin Ladins, Kazinskys of this world have convinced
<br>
me humanity needs to spread out and cover all the available
<br>
real estate, to make society inherently less vulnerable
<br>
and less dependent on those systems which cannot in
<br>
principle be defended.
<br>
<p>If global warming is true and we really can melt off
<br>
all that ice, we need to get on that, release that
<br>
carbon, free up all that land that is currently
<br>
unavailable.  All of northern Canada, Siberia, the
<br>
deserts, make it habitable, spread out, build enormous,
<br>
extended tenuously populated but inhabited civilization
<br>
on all of it, with thoroughly mixed cultures so that no
<br>
one religion or custom can take hold of the minds of
<br>
the people there.  All governments would need to be
<br>
secular and open minded.
<br>
<p>Siberia is a perfect example.  Russia needs money.  We
<br>
should be able to buy huge tracts of that empty
<br>
real estate and make something out of it.  The Luddites
<br>
and terrorists have shown that humans must stop
<br>
bunching up, spread out and reclaim unused, wasted
<br>
land.  And water.
<br>
<p>All that from a Nova program pointing out how easy it
<br>
would be to shut down a subway system.  spike
