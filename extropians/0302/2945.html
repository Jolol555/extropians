<p>Yes yes, my good man, but please draw up a free body diagram.
<br>
<p>First let me review my original argument.  Imagine an
<br>
asteroid in GEO, tidelocked so that one face stays
<br>
always toward the earth. A space elevator is created
<br>
by the mechanism Damien has suggested in his latest
<br>
story, wherein nanobots on the surface of a GEO
<br>
asteroid convert the material into a continuous
<br>
cable building it downward toward the surface of
<br>
the planet and upward toward space to counterbalance
<br>
the elevator.
<br>
<p>The earth's sidereal rotation rate is one revolution
<br>
per day (or rather 23 hrs 56 minutes) and so is the
<br>
asteroid.  The moment of inertia of a sphere is 2/5MR^2
<br>
and the moment of inertia of a long thin rod is 1/12ML^2.
<br>
If one assumes that all the mass of the Broderick-esque
<br>
asteroid (Broderic-inspired? Damienian?) ends up in a
<br>
rod 70,000 km in length, starting with a 1 km diameter
<br>
sphere, the moment of inertia is increased by a factor
<br>
of right at a billion.  Since angular momentum is
<br>
conserved, one would need to start with a rotation
<br>
rate of a billion revolutions per day to end up with
<br>
a synchronous cable, which presents its own engineering
<br>
challenges.
<br>
<p>Robert has suggested spinning up the cable as it is
<br>
built using propulsion, which would require a great
<br>
deal of propellant.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, if the cable is 45 degrees from vertical,
<br>
the earth's gravity will apply a torque, which will
<br>
supply angular momentum.
<br>
<p>Let theta (t) be the angle from vertical and let the
<br>
X axis be along the length of the rod with the origin
<br>
at the center of mass of the rod.  Let p be the mass
<br>
density and A be the cross sectional area.  Let Rg
<br>
be the distance to geosynchronous orbit and let w be
<br>
my best approximation of an omega with this keyboard.
<br>
<p>The mass of the differential is then pA(dX) so the
<br>
expression for the torque on the rod as a function
<br>
of theta is
<br>
<p>Torque = integral{MGpAdX/(Rg + Xcos(t))^2*Xsin(t) +
<br>
pAdx(w^2)(Rg + Xcos(t))(Xsin(t)dX}
<br>
<p>The integral is from -L/2 to L/2.
<br>
<p>Some of you math guys check my work while I go
<br>
off and integrate this function while watching
<br>
the finale of Joe Millionaire.
