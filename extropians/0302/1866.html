When I took a Space Camp astronauts training at Tranquility Base at the US
<br>
Space and Rocket Center, I was assigned 2 missions. One was to work as a
<br>
scientist building a hologram and the other was to act as a flight
<br>
director. 
<br>
<p>On one of these simulated missions, I met a person who designs the
<br>
protective thermal tiles for shuttles. He explained how very necessary it
<br>
is to have just the right temperature and control factor in the pressure
<br>
and expansion in dealing with heat and stress. He was very excited about
<br>
new materials and annoyed that the funding was so little for such an
<br>
expansive human quest. This was 15 years ago and I am very saddened that a
<br>
more durable and flexible material had not been engineered for the outer
<br>
protection of the shuttles.
<br>
<p>Like everyone on the list, I am very sad.

<br>
<p><p>&quot;Columbia's 16-day mission featured more than 80 experiments ranging from
<br>
the effects of space travel on astronauts to the possibility of creating a
<br>
new perfume.
<br>
<p>&quot;The folks on the ground were just ecstatic with the amount of science that
<br>
they were reaping,&quot; said Ron Dittemore, space shuttle program manager.
<br>
'Some of it was will be their legacy.'&quot;
