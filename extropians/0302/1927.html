<p>
wingcat noted:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Which reminds me.  I was talking to my dad about this earlier today, and
<br>
he mentioned that the white tiles used for the shuttle's upper body
<br>
would make great housing material except for the cost: excellent
<br>
insulators, totally fire and termite proof, strength to weight ratios
<br>
far more than adequate for a typical house, et cetera and so forth.  The
<br>
only problem would be cost - which, of course, is often a killer for
<br>
this kind of thing.  But he was wondering if, perhaps, getting some
<br>
contractors hooked on using these for housing materials would drive the
<br>
point down, such that making them for the occasional spaceship would be
<br>
a cheap custom job rather than the elaborate undertaking it presently
<br>
seems to be.  (Then again, everything at NASA seems to be an elaborate
<br>
undertaking, so maybe it's not the material's fault.)  Can anyone here
<br>
with any experience in this comment on this possibility?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><p>I am not a materials scientist, or aerospace engineer. Have disallowed myself 
<br>
as expect; let me chime in, nonetheless. I believe that snogging tiles to a 
<br>
spacecraft was a clever idea 30 years ago, but has proves more dangerous then 
<br>
useful. Similarly, a spacecraft relying on an external tank with boosters is 
<br>
unreliable. Thirdly, an earth orbiting spaceplane, should have active fuel in 
<br>
it to maneuver, and roam throw many orbits at many altitudes of orbit.  This 
<br>
fuel needs to be both volatile to be useful as fuel, and non-volatile to be 
<br>
safe enough. 
<br>
<p>Concurrent to #3, we need also to consider low thrust ion engines for orbital 
<br>
maneuver, for increasing and decreasing orbit altitude. This fuel of choice 
<br>
might be argon or xenon as a fuel for an ion drive. Both of these elements 
<br>
are reliable and stable for ion drives. The use of buckeye-tubes for a 
<br>
storage media, needs to be examined for this. There is, at least 45 years of 
<br>
lab experience with ion propulsion, which needs to be brought to bear.
<br>
<p>There are less radical notions then I have just proposed. One is the 
<br>
Armageddon space vehicle (secretly built by the USAF) which was made of 
<br>
titanium-steel alloy. Because of cost (put a dent on the titanium golf club 
<br>
market, it will!) engineers have backed-off this concept in the 1970's. We 
<br>
are speaking of here, a huge amount of titanium alloy. Is it worth it? Well, 
<br>
it would eliminate the tile debris issue and it is both heat and cold 
<br>
resistant; as well as expensive. But then, so is a halted space program.
<br>
<p>Other orbits considerations might be
<br>
<p>1) electromagnetic tethers (still tricky to keep in one piece)
<br>
2) different mixes and compounds for chemical rockets
<br>
3) A horizontal launch spaceplane (scramjet to atmosphere-rocket to orbit)
<br>
4) Roton (??) how safe is Roton anyway? Prop-failure anyone?
<br>
5) DX-3 Lets land like they did in Abbot &amp; Costello go to Mars.
<br>
6) Aerospace launch from the belly of a Spruce Goose sized carrier-lands reg.
<br>
<p>This is not the limit of ideas, but people still have to pay for any of this, 
<br>
somehow.
<br>
My suspicion is that, we need a spaceship fleet made out of much harder, much 
<br>
more corrosive/heat/cold resistant materials. We need an aerospace fleet, 
<br>
which can be said: &quot;These things are built like brick shithouses (or Mayan 
<br>
pyramids if you prefer), but they fly as smooth as Canada Geese!&quot;
