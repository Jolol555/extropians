<p>It would be even funnier to learn that the teen girl was actually one of

those undercover investigators trying to set up a sting operation to

bust online pedophiles. :)
<br>
<p>By the way I read an article a few months ago (somewhere) about the best
<br>
online chatbot in existence. It's the brainchild of some eccentric guy
<br>
with mental illness who programmed literally tens of thousands of
<br>
sentences into his program to allow it to reply to the real questions
<br>
and statements from the real people who have interacted with it online.
<br>
He just keeps looking at the inputs from real people and programming in
<br>
new answers to those statements and questions he hasn't seen or
<br>
programmed in the past. The bot works entirely by rote, with no high
<br>
level processing whatsoever. The program has won numerous AI awards for
<br>
its performance in the turing test, which is something of a slap in the
<br>
face to most AI enthusiasts. In essence it is merely a very large data
<br>
collection of typical real world communications, not much more
<br>
sophisticated than an ordinary dictionary. Perhaps you or someone here
<br>
knows about the program and can offer up some URL's. (I'm going only
<br>
from memory here. I don't follow developments in AI as well as I
<br>
should.)
