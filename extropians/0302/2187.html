<p>As yet another curious emergent-behavior thing about humans...
<br>
<p>Years ago, I used to see a highway minimum speed posted in Ohio of 40 mph.
<br>
So I asked my brother, who was studying to be a highway planner, why.
<br>
<p>Apparently there was said to be evidence that at a speed a bit lower
<br>
(around 38 or so, IIRC), driving behavior transitions from &quot;cruising&quot; to
<br>
&quot;stop-start&quot;; this contribution to the &quot;rubbernecker effect&quot; can create
<br>
a standing wave (soliton) slowdown that persists. And of course if the
<br>
traffic feeding to that spot is numerous and fast enough, the slowdown
<br>
spreads backwards. I conjecture that one critical factor is how drivers
<br>
_pass_; if they slow down more precipitously when passing a sub-40-mph
<br>
car than they do when both are traveling over 40, there you have your
<br>
bottleneck.
<br>
<p>I daresay most of the people stuck in bumper-to-bumper 3 mph traffic jams
<br>
think no deeper than that the minimum speed is some kind of sick joke.
<br>
I'm not sure how much positive effect those minimum speed signs have.
<br>
<p>Anyway, that's my story. There might be other reasons for those limits, too.
<br>
