<em>&gt; &quot;When do we act?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everyone is careful to say that they do not support Saddam Hussein but

</em><br>
<p><p>Frankly, Saddam as such is none of our business.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they
<br>
<em>&gt; fail to mention the *real* loss of human life of allowing him to remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in power (due to the sanctions against Iraq) and the potential for future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losses of human life should he remain in power (odds seem against Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undergoing a miraculous transformation into a peacenik from his current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orientation of restoring the Arab/Islamic world to power with him as
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>How the heck do we know what his orientation is at this time? 
<br>
For sure it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to 
<br>
gain any great power at this time or any time soon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mind you, I am not in favor of a war if containment can work.  *BUT*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've seen no reasonable discussion on whether the possible number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives saved by going to war and eliminating Saddam will exceed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of lives that might be lost in such a war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>We would save a LOT more lifes if we dropped the sanctions 
<br>
tomorrow, continued inspections and worked with groups out to 
<br>
democratize the country from within.  A lot of lives are being 
<br>
lost now, many of them from the sanctions.  It is guaranteed 
<br>
that many times that number of lives will be lost in the war and 
<br>
its predictable repurcussions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The entire &quot;peace&quot; movement I see here in Seattle (and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Melbourne or Germany) seems to be based on the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;no war ever&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Then you haven't been paying attention.  Many people marching 
<br>
are against this particular war, not necessarily against all 
<br>
wars no matter what.  Many are there because this war has not 
<br>
been sufficiently justified for the costs in lives, finances, 
<br>
increased likelihood of terrorism and destabilizing the region 
<br>
and the world further.  The onus of proof is on those who 
<br>
propose this action.  So far they have been singularly unconvincing.
