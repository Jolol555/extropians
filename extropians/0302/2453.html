A colleague has just passed these URLs on to me. It shows the state of the
<br>
sensors 
<br>
during Columbia's post re-entry phase, together with the routing of the
<br>
associated 
<br>
wiring. It is quite revealing. 
<br>
<p>&lt; <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/COL_sensor_wire_030207.pdf">http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/COL_sensor_wire_030207.pdf</a> &gt;
<br>
<p>There's also a better image of this ground tracking camera photograph:
<br>
<p>&lt; <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/COL_image_030207.html">http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/COL_image_030207.html</a> &gt;
<br>
<p>It's interesting that sensors in the main undercarriage bay show temperature 
<br>
anomolies while sensors that have cables that run past the bay simply stop
<br>
sending. 
<br>
The sensors that show normal readings but simply stop suggest a problem with the 
<br>
wiring, while sensors that go off scale appear to still be functioning until the 
<br>
sensors themselves fail. The first indicates a problem remote from the sensor,
<br>
the 
<br>
second indicates a problem close to the sensor.
<br>
<p>Looks like whatever happened to the wing was around the short section of wiring 
<br>
that ran across the front and outer side of the bay. And look how the anomolous 
<br>
sensors start at the back of the bay and work forward. By the time the forward 
<br>
sensors start showing unexpected readings, they start to fail almost
<br>
immediately, 
<br>
suggesting a sequential aft-to-forward build-up of heat in the bay.
<br>
<p>The photo is interesting, but it's a pity the resolution is so poor. Even 
<br>
accounting for variance in pixel brightness, it *does* look more than just
<br>
jitter 
<br>
in the data. With a bit of looking-sideways-at-the-picture-through-narrowed-eyes 
<br>
you might just convince yourself that the delineation in the profile matches the 
<br>
wing leading-edge kink just forward of the 90-degree bend in the sensor cable
<br>
run. 
<br>
Mind you, this is going to have to be studied long and hard by people with much 
<br>
more experience at interpreting these pictures than me before a definite
<br>
conclusion 
<br>
can be reached (you'd need to compare pictures taken of known objects to
<br>
calibrate 
<br>
the camera, for a start, to see if this image is real and not just a 
<br>
camera/lens/processing effect).
<br>
<p>More useful information might be gleaned from better details of the positions of 
<br>
the UC sensors in 3D space and a photo of the sensor cable lay-up, which might 
<br>
indicate which had greater shielding (by virtue of their position in the cable 
<br>
bundle). This could point to where the cable failures started to occur.
<br>
<p>It is another symptom - it still doesn't solidly identify the cause, though.
<br>
Still 
<br>
could be leading edge failure with progressive burn-through of the front or side
<br>
of 
<br>
the wheel well, undercarriage bay door loss or even the failure of the upper
<br>
skin. 
<br>
<p>Cheers,
