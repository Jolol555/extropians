<em>&gt; Let me know thanks, Nate
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The trick to speed reading is learning how not to &quot;sound out&quot; the words in
<br>
one's mind as one reads. But as above it pleases me to sound out the words
<br>
in my mind as I read, and so I lost interest in speed reading. &quot;
<br>
<p>Nate, I second gts's comments, I read often and have read a lot about speed
<br>
reading but was quite skeptical of it.  The other day I gave it a shot while
<br>
reading something I didn't particular enjoy but needed to read.  You have to
<br>
concentrate on not subvocalizing as you read (I understand some people do
<br>
not, and I wonder if deaf from birth people read faster) because reading in
<br>
that manner limits your speed to the subvocalization speed.  As I understand
<br>
it, the process is something like 
<br>
<p>1) brain recognizes word through pattern recognition
<br>
2) word is subvocalized
<br>
3) word entered into memory (kind of)
<br>
<p>When looking at it like that, its hard to understand what the
<br>
subvocalization is for, since part of recognizing a word necessarily entails
<br>
recognizing that word!  So anyway, I tried it the other day and made a
<br>
concentrated effort to not subvocalize but I lead my eyes in the reading
<br>
with a finger (another tactic often suggested) After each sentence I would
<br>
stop and attempt to repeat the sentence, to my astonishment I found I often
<br>
could repeat it word for word, with more accuracy than if I had
<br>
subvocalized.  The retentioned seemed to be better than the conventional
<br>
type of reading, but it is very difficult to get used to reading without
<br>
subvocalization, its like soaking up information without your upper level of
<br>
conciousness being aware of it.  I think that might be the role
<br>
subvocalization plays, your super fast pattern recognition and information
<br>
processing capable brain telling your relatively dimwitted serial process
<br>
simulated 'conciousness' that you are in fact reading.
<br>
<p>I need to practice more, but I keep tending back to subvocalized reading as
<br>
gts mentions, because it seems more enjoyable? 
<br>
