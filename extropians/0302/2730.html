You haven't lost citizens on your own soil yet, have you? That can make all 
<br>
the difference. Americans have died in embassy bombings, the attacks on the 
<br>
khobar towers, and the USS Cole. Until it happens at home, its all rather, 
<br>
overseas. Anti-war protests are merely anti-American protests, under the 
<br>
anti-war figleaf. Had Al Gore achieved a plurality in the electoral collage, 
<br>
and become President; the world-wide protests against American actions would 
<br>
have still persisted, unabated. 
<br>
<p><p>Avatar mentioned:
<br>
&lt;&lt;. No one supported Saddam Hussein, but all rejected the notion of first 
<br>
strikes, preemptive action, as completely unjustified. Australia has lost 
<br>
citizens in the Bali bombings, so America cannot turn around and claim that 
<br>
we too have not been affected by 9 11. Tthe number of ordinary citizens 
<br>
present and their obvious convinction made me feel that half the population 
<br>
of our nation are wholly against this venture, whether backed by the UN or 
<br>
not. This is perceived, rightly or wrongly, as a war of agression, one that 
<br>
supercedes a successful policy of containment.
