<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But..... the USA traffic deaths are still worse than many countries with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mostly smaller cars and higher gas taxes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The excellent site  <a href="http://www.scienceservingsociety.com/default.htm">http://www.scienceservingsociety.com/default.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Edwin Evans referred us to is packed with useful data. They have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article published in the SF Examiner 9th Dec 2002 by Leonard Evans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entitled 'We need higher taxes on gas' which eloquently sets out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'While there is near universal agreement in the technical community that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making vehicles lighter increases fatalities, there is no corresponding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreement that increasing the fuel economy of vehicles reduces the total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of fuel consumed in the nation. Making a vehicle more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuel-economic reduces the cost of travelling each mile. This encourages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more driving, less car-pooling and less use of alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transportation modes. In the long run, it makes longer commuting trips
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more acceptable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Although there is no consensus on whether making vehicles more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuel-economic increases or decreases the total amount of fuel the nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uses, there is universal agreement among economists that increasing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost of a commodity reduces its consumption.'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end Quote.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leonard Evans is the same person that published the previous report that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said that big cars provide better driver protection in crashes. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears to have come to the conclusion that increased death rates in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spite of larger cars must mean that Americans are 'bad' drivers. Other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; articles show that young males with the fastest reactions have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highest death rate. So it is not technical skills at driving that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem - it is the way they are driving that is the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect that Newton's Laws of Motion have an affect as well. If your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SUV has a much greater mass then it will tend to keep going in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction of motion, especially at higher speeds. i.e. it is not as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steerable as a smaller, lighter car.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The countries with the lowest traffic death rates appear to have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongest enforcement of traffic laws and drink-driving laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, there seems to be two options for the future that Americans have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face up to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Higher gas prices are the only way to reduce consumption and reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the power of the oilfield-owning states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) The freedom to drive just as you please on the roads must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restricted in order to save lives.
</em><br>
<p>### Ah, exactly, *somebody* must save my life against my will. I must be
<br>
deprived of the ability to move around, so I won't get hurt on the way.
<br>
<p>I have a different two-point plan:
<br>
1) Rounding-up of busybodies in camps where they can interfere only with
<br>
each other is the only way to reduce unwanted interference and power of
<br>
busybodies.
<br>
2) The freedom to propose restrictions on freedom must be restricted in
<br>
order to save freedom.
