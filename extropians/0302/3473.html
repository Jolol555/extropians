Living to 1000?
<br>
One futurist thinks it's possible. Others spoke of bioterrorism, 
<br>
obesity, and the genome project as the conference came to an end.
<br>
By FREDERIC GOLDEN
<br>
<p><p>DAVID PAUL MORRIS FOR TIME
<br>
U.S. Surgeon General Vice Admiral Richard H. Carmona addresses the 
<br>
conference
<br>
<p>Friday, Feb. 21, 2003
<br>
Monterey, Calif. —TIME's three-day forum on the Future of Life ended on 
<br>
a note of extravagant promises about a coming century of startling 
<br>
advances — in personalized medicine, including life spans well beyond 
<br>
100 years, increasingly smart computer programs that will emulate 
<br>
biological processes, new genetically engineered sources of energy and 
<br>
outreaches into space that will take both humans and robots far from 
<br>
their home planet.
<br>
<p>But even as the prophets of this bold new world were making their 
<br>
far-out forecasts, other participants in a conference that marked the 
<br>
50th anniversary of the discovery of the double helix sounded much more 
<br>
skeptical notes. They warned that as futurist Arthur Clarke once 
<br>
remarked, short-term predictions about technological advances often tend 
<br>
to lag far behind predicted timetables. As an example, composer and 
<br>
visual artist Jaron Lanier cited problems that still plague even our 
<br>
simplest computer programs. &quot;Software is still software,&quot; he said, 
<br>
openly questioning its ability to handle increased complexity that all 
<br>
the projected advances would require.
<br>
<p>A different sort of warning for the 400 scientists, academics, artists, 
<br>
clerics and business executives attending TIME's DNA fest was sounded by 
<br>
Vice Admiral Richard Carmona, the new U.S. Surgeon General. Replying to 
<br>
the many scientists trying to get the Bush Administration to lift its 
<br>
partial ban on embryonic stem cell research, he urged them not to get 
<br>
ahead of the American public. People are still quite baffled by this 
<br>
sort of research, he said, and need to be educated about it. &quot;Science 
<br>
must take care it does not leave the public behind,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>In a conference-closing speech that recalled his &quot;truly surreal journey&quot; 
<br>
from an impoverished childhood in New York's Hispanic East Harlem to 
<br>
become America's chief doctor, the former trauma surgeon welcomed the 
<br>
benefits from the genomics revolution, but also stressed that America 
<br>
faced immediate and very critical health problems, notably the epidemic 
<br>
of obesity among the young. &quot;It's every bit as threatening as the 
<br>
terrorist threat,&quot; he said, adding it would lead to a level of disease 
<br>
and chronic illness that would confront the country with a crushing 
<br>
economic burden.
<br>
<p>The answer, Carmona said, was to persuade kids to eat better and 
<br>
exercise more rather than to look to fancy new biomedical technologies. 
<br>
Said he, &quot;We should not have to rely on good science to undo the bad 
<br>
choices people have made.&quot; He also called for incentives that would 
<br>
encourage physicians and other health care providers to stress 
<br>
prevention and wellness rather than always looking to drugs and surgery 
<br>
to alleviate chronic disease.
<br>
<p>But for sheer scariness, the most grim talk came from Raymond Zilinskas, 
<br>
an expert in bioterrorism at the Monterey Institute of International 
<br>
Studies. In chilling detail, he described the efforts of Soviet 
<br>
scientists at the height of the Cold War to develop lethal germs, such 
<br>
as variations of anthrax and the smallpox virus, that could be carried 
<br>
to targets almost anywhere on Earth by ballistic missile. While these 
<br>
programs have presumably long since been cancelled, he foresaw no real 
<br>
defense against such bioweapons, other than stronger international 
<br>
conventions. That's something the Bush administration has resolutely 
<br>
opposed, he said.
<br>
<p>Though they avoided a face-to-face meeting, the TIME forum heard from 
<br>
both Francis Collins and J. Craig Venter, the rival leaders of the 
<br>
public and private human genome projects. Collins, describing himself as 
<br>
both exhilarated and terrorized in the aftermath of his team's great 
<br>
sequencing effort, announced ambitious new goals. These include 
<br>
sequencing all 23 pairs of human chromosomes, applying genomics to the 
<br>
treatment of specific diseases, developing gene-spotting systems for 
<br>
early detection of disease and expanding genome studies to larger 
<br>
populations so as to pinpoint the role of genetic differences in disease.
<br>
<p>Venter, similarly, stressed that the sequencing effort was just a 
<br>
starting point for much more science. He said an immediate target should 
<br>
be reducing the cost of sequencing an individual genome to $1,000 or 
<br>
less in the next decode or so. This would be a powerful tool, he said, 
<br>
to catch diseases like colon cancer years before the onset of observable 
<br>
symptoms when there is a 90 percent or better chance of curing them. &quot;We 
<br>
would give power to the individual to know their own risk of disease,&quot; 
<br>
he said.
<br>
<p>Now the heading up four nonprofit genomics groups, Celera Genomics' 
<br>
former CEO discussed his latest interests, notably the development of 
<br>
synthetic microbes that could be used to produce inexpensive, 
<br>
nonpolluting alternatives to fossil fuels like hydrogen. Asked if it was 
<br>
really true, as one magazine recently reported, that his ambition was 
<br>
nothing less than to save the planet, Venter thought for a milli-second, 
<br>
then allowed, &quot;Well, we want to make a start.&quot;
<br>
<p>Perhaps the most exciting discussion centered on using the new findings 
<br>
from the elucidation of the human genome to lengthen our productive 
<br>
lives. Susan Greenfield, director of the Royal Institution of Great 
<br>
Britain, thought that ?quite soon? women would be able to have their 
<br>
eggs fertilized while they were still in their normal child-bearing 
<br>
years, store them and then bear the child whenever they choose. &quot;People 
<br>
of all ages will be having children,&quot; she said. Polymath inventor 
<br>
Raymond Kurzweil made a prediction that left even his fellow futurists 
<br>
gasping. Asked how long he expected to live in light of all these 
<br>
advances, he replied unhestitatingly, &quot;1,000 years. My kids, too.&quot;
