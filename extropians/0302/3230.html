<p><em>&gt; &gt; Title: Raelians 'Download' Dolly's Brain Into New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Clone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Link:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.scrappleface.com/MT/archives/000661.html">http://www.scrappleface.com/MT/archives/000661.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most readers of this list can already think of all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usual objections (present ability to read neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tissue into digital storage, present portability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipment that could do so, et cetera), so I'll only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state a couple of the non-obvious reasons why this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a complete and total hoax:
</em><br>
<p>Oh, Adrian, I haven't even *looked* at that article.
<br>
<p>OF COURSE it's a hoax!
<br>
<p>The title itself made me burst out laughing.  You were
<br>
supposed to see immediately that it was a put-on.
<br>
<p>We all know that the Raelians make EXTREMELY dubious
<br>
claims in the first place (clue 1), and that they could
<br>
have gone VASTLY FURTHER than anyone is even dreaming
<br>
of doing at present (clue 2) ... is..., well, ridiculous
<br>
and funny.
<br>
<p>This reminds me of the time a couple of weeks ago that
<br>
Eliezer---obviously speaking somewhat tongue-in-cheek
<br>
began claiming infallibility for Google.  He wasn't
<br>
being serious---just exaggerating to make a point,
<br>
and in an attention-getting and engaging way.
<br>
<p>(I retorted, also completely in cheek, by providing a
<br>
detailed psychoanalytic diagnosis of the condition
<br>
of the &quot;patient&quot; (who I referred to as EY, as is
<br>
sometimes done in famous medical cases).  I hope
<br>
that you didn't take *my* remarks so seriously too!)
<br>
<p>Yes, I know that there are truly astounding revelations
<br>
here from time to time (the current one being a possible
<br>
new way to store energy), but develop the old sense of
<br>
humor a bit, and learn to see the ridiculous in life.
<br>
It's so fun, when you do.
<br>
<p>(I'm still laughing about the Raelians downloading
<br>
Dolly's brain into a clone!)
<br>
<p>Lee
