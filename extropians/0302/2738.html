</em><br>
<em>&gt; point, I blame the media's glamorization of cloning.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that safety hasn't been sufficiently well established to
<br>
justify reproductive cloning of humans.
<br>
<p>At the same time, most of the data people cite about how unsafe
<br>
cloning is are either wrong or exaggerated.  For example, people talk
<br>
about the fact that it took 200+ attempts to create Dolly.  The
<br>
undertone is often that the failed attempts were awful, mutated sheep
<br>
that died at birth.  That's just not true.  Of all the attempts to
<br>
create Dolly, only 1 egg implanted in the uterus.  Most of the eggs
<br>
failed to ever divide.  The rest died at around the 8 cell stage.
<br>
<p>In any case, my goal was to point out that Dolly's medical problems
<br>
could well stem from technical problems in the cloning process that
<br>
have since been ironed out.
<br>
<p>cheers,
