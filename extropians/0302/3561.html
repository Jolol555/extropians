<em>&gt; Yes, we should start to think about invading the USA and establish a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government that obeys international law. There's even enough evidence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. evidence of Mr. Powell's standards) that the US still has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological WMDs (which they are not allowed to have) and they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively developing new weapons - land mines - that are forbidden IIRC. 
</em><br>
<p>Then there is the use of chemical agents domestically, against women and children.
<br>
Chemical agents that we agreed not to use against foreign enemies in time of war.
<br>
<p>[Between February 28, 1993 and April 19th, 1993, approximately 80 men, women, and children living near Waco, Texas, were killed by the combined efforts of the US Defense Department and other government paramilitary units: the US Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The incident began with a military-style raid on February 28, complete with helicopter gunships firing down upon the women's and children's quarters. Then followed a long siege. On April 19, the US government sent tanks to GAS the building where the people lived. The government said they decided to gas the Davidians because they were concerned about the sanitary conditions in the house, because they were afraid one of the Davidians, David Koresh, was spanking babies. CS gas was used even though it is banned for use against foreign enemies by an international agreement in 1969.]
<br>
<p>Then there's that earlier regime change in Iran, where the CIA had a big hand in overthrowing the first democratically elected leader of Iran. And Shah Pahlavi maintained his dictatorial rule for the next quarter century through the support of the CIA. The CIA even trained SAVAK, the Shah's secret police who were responsible for torturing or killing as many as 10,000 Iranian political dissidents.
