<em>&gt;  Yes, and it wouldn't really take that large a moon to allow an

<em>&gt; &gt; of billions of years of carbon sequestration that followed an

<em>&gt; impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; event that stripped much of earth's original lithosphere, which now

<em>&gt; &gt; forms most of the moon. Saturn's moon Titan has an atmosphere
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; surface is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thick with precipitated atmosphere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hold on. I thought our atmosphere was retained because of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magnetosphere (preventing the solar wind from stripping it) [possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in turn due to our liquid iron core surrounding the solid iron core].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's complicated because of internal radioactive mechanisms and an
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; combined with water dumped from meteorites.
</em><br>
<p>No, the magnetosphere has little to do with atmospheric retention other
<br>
than reducing the amount of radiation we receive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm been trying to get a handle on this with Earth vs. Venus vs. Mars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the varying conditions. Also of course as Mike says the influence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the x-body and the proto-Earth body that resulted in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth-Moon system and its chemical peculiarities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All I can say is that some sources claim the atmosphere would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been nearly completely stripped away, however it was generated, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the solar wind were it not for the active magnetosphere.
</em><br>
<p>This is simply not true. Venus has little or no magnetosphere, yet it
<br>
retains 92 times more atmosphere than we have, PLUS it is half the
<br>
distance to the sun, so it gets much more solar wind per square inch
<br>
than we get.
<br>
<p>Jovian planets are almost entirely atmosphere, yet solar wind does not
<br>
strip them away either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am still trying to read upon on the explanations for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pecularities of Venus.
</em><br>
<p>If life had not evolved here, the earth would have 50 times more
<br>
atmosphere than it has now. Most of our original atmosphere is now
<br>
locked up as limestone rock. If the moon was not there to cause our
<br>
active tectonics, life would have turned our atmosphere almost entirely
<br>
into rock as it once did to Mars. Instead, tectonics, as well as other
<br>
biological processes recycles some of the limestone back to the
<br>
atmosphere. Enough CO2 is there to retain some solar energy at the
<br>
surface, but not enough to block thermal radiation entirely.
<br>
<p>Venus' atmosphere is so dense that its albedo is so high that it
<br>
actually absorbs LESS heat than Earth does, it just holds on to far
<br>
more of what it does absorb.
<br>
<p>I suggest those interested Fogg's textbook &quot;Terraforming Planetary
<br>
Environments&quot; to become informed on the subject.
