This depends on several variables.  It's frequently true.  But it sure 
<br>
isn't always true.  It's also frequently true that mass transit is a lot 
<br>
faster...if the roads are sufficiently packed.
<br>
<p>However, there are other costs.  Mass transit doesn't take you from any 
<br>
old starting position, and it doesn't deliver you to any old 
<br>
destination.  If you are starting from a optimal place, and ending in an 
<br>
optimal place, then it can be faster even in conditions of only moderate 
<br>
traffic.  If the traffic is really bad, then it can be faster even if 
<br>
you need to walk a few blocks, or transfer to a bus, at one end of the 
<br>
route.  And if it's horrendous, then it can be 10 times as fast.  This 
<br>
is largely dependant on how well the streets, parking, etc. match the 
<br>
number of cars that it is intended to put on them.  But this is 
<br>
basically fixed when any city is originally designed.  True, there are 
<br>
usually retro-fits that can double or tripple the original design limit 
<br>
(at a cost in esthetics and convenience and $$).  But then you hit a 
<br>
wall, unless you decide to, e.g., double-deck your roads (and not just 
<br>
the freeways), and put up skyscrapers just for parking.
<br>
<p>So he may be quite right for where he's looking.  I don't know the 
<br>
area.  And I certainly wouldn't call mass transit cheap.  But when 
<br>
density reaches certain levels, it becomes necessary.  (It may still be 
<br>
more expensive than cars [perhaps], but beyond a certain level cars just 
<br>
won't work.)
