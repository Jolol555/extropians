What can be more delightful, talking about what other
<br>
people should do with their time, and what they should
<br>
read?  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Lee Corbin suggested to you that you read the book by Hernando de
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Soto, The Mystery of Capitalism.  I suggest you do so also.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have not had the opportunity to read TMoC.  Though I believe I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think and espouse many of the principles I would hope it promotes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My impression of the position that Mez holds seems to *not* be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly different from mine or that I would expect to find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in TMoC.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the question of why one would be urging Mez to read TMoC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remains open.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, if we all had all the time we wanted, then we
<br>
could read everything.  Surprising as it may seem, those
<br>
who never die *do* get to read everything.
<br>
<p>Believe me, &quot;The Mystery of Capital&quot; is a find book,
<br>
filled with marvelous insights.  It's quite inaccurate
<br>
for one to think that one &quot;already knows&quot; what would be
<br>
in such a book.
<br>
<p>Although &quot;The Mystery of Capital&quot; is about Egypt (in
<br>
part---DeSoto discusses five or so countries in parallel),
<br>
what Mez and the rest of us were talking about is more
<br>
directly addressed by an even more precisely relevant
<br>
book:  &quot;The Elusive Quest for Growth&quot;, by William
<br>
Easterly.
<br>
<p>The author worked for decades at the IMF, and has an
<br>
incredible amount of experience looking at what does
<br>
and does not work in third-world countries.  His 
<br>
assessments of what goes wrong there are superb.
<br>
It's quite funny in places, and the author indulges
<br>
in a lot of humorous self-criticism.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A better question might be why in the hell is
<br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. supporting an undemocratic regime Egypt to the tune
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 3+ billion dollars per year some 20 years after we bribed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our way into producing a peace settlement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would like to start you down that road, to understanding the US,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with this thought -- can you believe we sort of stumbled into our success
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pattern and even today 98% of our people haven't got the foggiest idea what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it was that we did (and are doing) that was right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, this is a *key* insight.  And it is one that de Soto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or any other economist may not stumble across.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While capitalism and/or libertarianism are key elements that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know people on the ExI list will swear up and down are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential components they may neglect another critical component.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By and large the U.S. population was self-selected!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any economic/political discussion that leaves out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic components of the U.S. population I will always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view as incomplete.  The same may be viewed of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australian population (though my understanding of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraction of self-selection may have taken place there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is much less certain).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a fundamental question -- does one sacrifice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones current security (limited as it may be) for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a completely unknown security in a foreign land?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In response to the above point (98% of our people don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know what we are doing right) I would like to suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the ancestors of many/most Americans selected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to take the risk.  Americans are fundamentally a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;risk taking&quot; population.  Those who are descended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from people who did not immigrate are in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;risk opposed&quot; population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And that may make all the difference with respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the economic performance of a country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It might have little or nothing to do with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; academic structures that support capitalism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might have a lot to do with the people who actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implement it.
</em><br>
