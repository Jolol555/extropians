<p><em>&gt; Sometimes this list makes my head spin. I simply can't believe

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ##Emlyn, please don't make such unfounded charges without any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evidence.  Of course I do understand why you wouldn't offer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evidence of that charge -- there isn't any.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So Emlyn has to *prove* that the United States (like the UK and several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other nation states) possesses and builds nuclear weapons?
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  Perhaps that's not such a bad idea!  Now it's incontestible
<br>
that the U.S. *had* weapons of mass destruction back in 1996,
<br>
oh, wait, no, that was 1945.  Even longer ago.  But does that
<br>
*prove* that the U.S. has them now?
<br>
<p>Sure, the U.S. says it does, just to intimidate everybody.
<br>
But can they really be trusted?
<br>
<p>But the more economical alternative---no doubt seized upon
<br>
in the early Eisenhower administration---was to just put
<br>
up a dummy program.  After all, who'd believe that the
<br>
U.S. has no WMD?  (Perhaps we should even demand proof
<br>
that anyone on the planet has such awful things.)
<br>
<p>I'm not sure whether to credit Damien or Ron H. with this
<br>
profound insight.
