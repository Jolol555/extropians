<p>Such a cycle would have to process the high-level waste as fast as it 
<br>
produces it. Have you calculated this? What about the medium and low 
<br>
active wastes? What about the machinery itself? How much of that do you 
<br>
get, how long will this be dangerous and what are the costs of its 
<br>
processing and disposal, including material, energy, personnel and 
<br>
space? I haven't seen any serious calculation that takes all this into 
<br>
account and comes up with a positive sum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but the glass itself needs to be stored away from inquisitive persons...
</em><br>
<p>... not only persons, but also natural forces like earth quakes, etc.
<br>
<p>And can we assure that this technology, power plants and such, will 
<br>
always be properly maintained and in the hand of responsible persons? 
<br>
There're dozens of nuclear driven ships and subs of the FSU rotting in 
<br>
their habors. Many power stations are also rotten and only hold together 
<br>
with duct tape. Or what about a civil war in China, Japan, Africa or 
<br>
South America, e.g. Brazil? The &quot;human factor&quot; is an incalculable risk 
<br>
in this equation.

<p><em>&gt; The only way to eliminate the heat load of technology on the surface of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'll think of fission power as a safe technology, as soon as someone 
<br>
shows me an effective method to stop radioactive decay or some device to 
<br>
bring tons of radioactive waste to a place _really_ outside our 
<br>
biosphere. Until then, the remaining risks are too high for my personal 
<br>
measure of safety. If that makes me an &quot;enviro-wacko&quot; in your eyes, I'll 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;return this with a friendly &quot;techno-loony&quot; :-)
