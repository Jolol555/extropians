Power Americana
<br>
By Paul Reynolds
<br>
BBC News Online world affairs correspondent
<br>
<p>Excellent analysis here from the BBC.
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2801349.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2801349.stm</a>
<br>
<p>In September 2000, as Mr Bush was running for the presidency, the New
<br>
American Century team produced a report called &quot;Rebuilding America's
<br>
Defences&quot;.
<br>
&quot;As the 20th Century draws to a close, the United States stands as the
<br>
world's pre-eminent power,&quot; it said.
<br>
&quot;Having led the West to victory in the Cold War, America faces an
<br>
opportunity and a challenge.
<br>
Does the United States have the vision to build upon the achievement of
<br>
past decades?
<br>
Does the United States have the resolve to shape a new century
<br>
favourable to American principles and interests?
<br>
[What we require] is a military that is strong... a foreign policy that
<br>
boldly and purposefully promotes American interests... and a national
<br>
leadership that accepts the United States' global responsibility.&quot;
<br>
<p>In a book called &quot;The War over Iraq: Saddam's Tyranny and America's
<br>
Mission&quot;, William Kristol, and Lawrence F Kaplan, stated:
<br>
&quot;The complacent assumptions of the post-Cold War era were
<br>
destroyed on September 11.
<br>
That day brought us to a new era for which we need a new road map.
<br>
If America does not shape this new epoch, we can be sure that others
<br>
will shape it for us - in ways that neither further our interests nor
<br>
reflect our ideas.
<br>
For the United States this is a decisive moment.&quot;
<br>
<p>The former CIA Director James Woolsey praised the book.
<br>
&quot;The authors show us why - in this age of terror, rogue states and
<br>
weapons of mass destruction - we can only make the world safe for
<br>
democracy by finishing the job of democratising it,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Very well said. We should be very thankful that the USA is prepared to
<br>
put their lives on the line on our behalf (and on their own behalf as
<br>
well, of course). If the USA is successful everyone will benefit, the
<br>
USA, the UK, Europe and all the victims of dictators around the world.
<br>
<p><p>Best wishes, BillK
