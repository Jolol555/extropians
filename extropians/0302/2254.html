</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I fervently pray that Tipler's hypotheses turn out to be correct,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I read Tipler, I remember I was wondering why on earth he wanted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haul back every person who had EVER lived back into life again.  From that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment on I thought he must be completely nuts.  I guess, it's fine to

</em><br>
<p>No, once the cost were to come down, and it is technically feasible,
<br>
why not?  Besides, it definitely would be the moral thing to do!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But then, am I really that naive or would that mean I had to sign up for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking - let's say - half a dozen resurrected Mongolian warriors who died in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a tribal skirmish with Western Siberians some 30.000 years ago into my

</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammoth meat for them to eat and help them getting along with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; application form for social security?
</em><br>
<p>Quite possibly, Tipler had something more esoteric in mind
<br>
than your apartment  ;-)  but thanks for offering.  One
<br>
supposes (following another thread on ephemeralization)
<br>
that this should all be done strictly in virtual reality,
<br>
and that the Siberians would find in their vast steppes
<br>
even more to plunder than usual.  (Only by and by, I presume, 
<br>
would they begin to advance along personal evolutionary
<br>
paths of self-transformation.  That is, you can only ride
<br>
around even in Asia for so long raping and pillaging before
<br>
it becomes boring, and some of those disco bars on the 
<br>
horizon start looking interesting.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I mean what great effort would it mean to provide a job
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for all the humans who had ever lived?
</em><br>
<p>Well, we don't even provide jobs for all the people we
<br>
now have  8^D  and they're not too bad off!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What would you do with Stalin, Hitler and Pol Pot?
</em><br>
<p>A more delicate question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Gently brain wash them with a love-peace-and-happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuro linguistic program?
</em><br>
<p>Basically, I would say yes.  We could resurrect remorseful
<br>
versions of same, who would perhaps understand with super-
<br>
human clarity the unhappiness they had created.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Think about some animal right fighters who make it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Omega Point!  Would they stand up for resurrecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all primates who had ever lived?  Dolphins?  This might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get pretty crowed down here.
</em><br>
<p>Plenty of space in virtual reality.  But besides, consider
<br>
insects.  In the immortal words of Ronald Reagan, if you've
<br>
seen one Agabetes acuductus (a rare form of beetle according
<br>
to Google), then you've seen 'em all!  (Slightly paraphrased.)
<br>
<p>It's not like they have much in the way of individual experiences.
<br>
So somewhere between primates and bugs, some economy will obtain,
<br>
all so that more resources can be devoted to running us and our
<br>
true brethren.
