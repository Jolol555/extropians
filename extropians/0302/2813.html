<p>Yes, science + art =  components of Transhumanist Arts period.  You are 
<br>
right about &quot;Extropianism&quot; being &lt;rhetoric.  It's Extropian :-)  (Those 
<br>
&quot;ism&quot; bog down clear thinking.)
<br>
<p>Rothko canvasses?  I suppose that looking at the pavement on a rainy day 
<br>
and seeing the marks made as the water permeates the cement and lifts up 
<br>
nature's marks in ways that are  at times stunning and at times like a Sumi 
<br>
brush on Japanese paper.  I like his big canvasses, their economy of 
<br>
expression and way of making a surface.  Makes me think of a rainy 
<br>
day.  The Spirit of Myth collection of 26 paintings which have been rarely 
<br>
seen and unlike his mature abstract style which is renowned for its 
<br>
atmospheric fields of color, is characterized by conventional themes such 
<br>
as landscapes, still-lifes, figure studies, and portraits, painted in an 
<br>
expressionist style. Lots of stories and real world images.
<br>
<p>After studying at Yale University, he was influenced by Surrealism and also 
<br>
Nietzsche's _Birth of Tradgedy_.  (Could have influenced his suicide, but 
<br>
not his extropian or transhumanist thinking.) Most of Rothko's mythological 
<br>
paintings portray hybrid figures, combinations of decorative and 
<br>
architectural elements and &quot;compositions reminiscent of Roman sarcophagi.&quot;
<br>
_______
<br>
<p>&quot;Rothko's mature work, we must agree, is voluptuous, gorgeous, at once 
<br>
ample and spare. People also - as Rothko himself knew, and as Golding notes 
<br>
- look great in front of them. But too many people turn them into 
<br>
backdrops, and there are almost always too many people nowadays. The 
<br>
details, the pleasures of their thinly washed, matted glazes and breathy 
<br>
surfaces, and the time the paintings take up (they sort of eat you, and 
<br>
root you to the spot) are a lesson, too, about a kind of art that isn't 
<br>
really made any more, a kind of looking that's all too rare.
<br>
...
<br>
<p>&quot;His last works, harder-edged, more overtly referential than anything that 
<br>
preceded them for two decades, are unavoidably close to a kind of 
<br>
terror-filled but otherwise empty landscape. They unavoidably recall Caspar 
<br>
David Friedrich, as well as, in their colour, the grimly washed studio 
<br>
portraits of Giacometti. They are grim, stoical paintings. Their stoicism 
<br>
outlasted Rothko, who committed suicide in his studio by slitting his 
<br>
wrists, aged 66 in 1970. You can't help but think of his last days when you 
<br>
look at them. But then again, the paintings are not equivalents to 
<br>
character, or human failings. They're better than that, and about more than 
<br>
despair. They invite lengthy contemplation. The trouble is, even if there's 
<br>
no one else in the room, Rothko keeps getting in the way. I wish he'd go 
<br>
away. &quot; -- Adrian Searle
