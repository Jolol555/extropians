<em>&gt; All right, the picture you're painting is becoming a little clearer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You suggest that the oil-importing company tax oil before it's

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You also claim that the oil-producing countries enjoy &quot;windfall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profits&quot;.  I'll agree that Rafal's bananas weren't a very good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, but to me, the only possibility of an &quot;undeserved&quot;, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;windfall&quot; profit is one that obtains upon collusion, i.e., not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of the action of a free market.  Indeed, OPEC has tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obtain precisely these profits.  So it's unclear to me whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not you agree on this restricted meaning of &quot;windfall&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>No, you are right, I was thinking of a windfall as being something good that 
<br>
comes through chance. In the context of this discussion I intended it to 
<br>
refer to the nature of the Middle Eastern oil reserves. The Middle East 
<br>
wealth from oil is not due to any particularly proclivity to productivity on 
<br>
the part of the people but rather to the happenstance that put a hugh 
<br>
percentage of the worlds oil reserves under their feet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We know windfall profits take place just by taking a look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the money being made by the oil producing nations from oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sales.  That money is not the result of human labour: [Labor:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Brain power and or muscle power applied to some productive end.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's evident that you see these profits as undeserved.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism and free markets, of course, aren't about that at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all.  They're about sending signals:  the signal here is &quot;FIND
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AND DEVELOP OIL OR CHEAP REPLACEMENTS!!&quot;.  But maximal progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always appears to be attended by maximal freedom:  the oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producers should have the soul motive of making as much money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as they can, up to but not including collusion.  For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'll probably agree that if oil had flowed to the world from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Middle East the way it should have, our civilization would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be much progressed from what it is now.
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't have a problem with such profits. However I do tend to think that 
<br>
the price of oil reflects a very short sighted view. It seems likely that my 
<br>
childrens children will live in a time of very expensive oil and it also 
<br>
seems somewhat likely that their lives will be of lower quality because of 
<br>
that. I see this as a threat to long term progress.
<br>
<p>I do tend to look at the planet and its resources as being something 
<br>
&quot;belonging&quot; to all mankind. I realize that is not a popular perspective - 
<br>
especially in the eyes of those who control significant resources. Take the 
<br>
situation of Middle Eastern control over a large portion of the worlds oil 
<br>
resources to an extreme - what if not only did a small group of people 
<br>
control all the oil reserves but all the land, mineral and water resources of 
<br>
the world. That group of people then effectively enslaves the remaining 
<br>
people. I think that from the perspective of taking mankind to the next 
<br>
level, however you envision that process, the aforementioned situation is 
<br>
harmful. What I would like is a way to keep the natural resources of the 
<br>
planet effectively being used for the benefit of all AND ensure that those 
<br>
who work the most effectively and the hardest reap the benefits of their 
<br>
efforts. Taxing income is exactly the wrong signal to send to achieve that 
<br>
goal. Taxing natural resources and land allows folks to fully benefit from 
<br>
their smarts or labor and to _choose_ (to an extent) how much tax they wish 
<br>
to pay.
<br>
<p>For me the musician, actor, ASIC engineer (thats me!), garbage truck driver, 
<br>
school teacher, investment banker, lawyer, McDonalds minimum wager and 
<br>
massage therapist are all contributing to the advancement of humankind, each 
<br>
to the best of their ability at a point in time. However the person who 
<br>
controls a resource (perhaps keeping it out of the market and preventing 
<br>
someone else from making economic use of it) contributes nothing. The land 
<br>
speculator, the oil magnate, generally these folks are not doing anything for 
<br>
the economy and I think they probably slow it down. They generate personal 
<br>
wealth at the expense of economic activity and in my opinion that cost to the 
<br>
economy is far greater than the benefit of their windfall profits money being 
<br>
available for investing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But whatever; to understand the market mechanics, I'll continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to follow your intriguing line of thought:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ii.   Prices of oil based products; fuel, plastics, etc. naturally rise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, though it's not directly relevant, the whole society is placed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a slightly slower exponential growth curve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; iii.  Alternatives to oil based products appear a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;       cheaper. I.e. wood or metal instead of plastic, bicycling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;       instead of driving etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; iv.   Some consumption shifts away from oil to alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; v.    Demand for oil decreases slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vi.   To maintain revenues oil producers drop prices a little (*)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, say that the tax increases were infinitesimal, and so your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price drop here is infinitesimal (by looking at the derivatives,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we might see the cause/effect relationship more easily).  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did you say what happened to the consuming economy?  Does (vi)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result in as much oil as used previously or not?  I guess that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either way, your point is that the oil producing countries get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less money.
</em><br>
<p>There would no doubt be unintended consequences. Are those unintended 
<br>
consequences greater than the unintended consequences of a tax on income? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now if the *level* of oil consumption returns to its previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level, then no economic harm has been done.  Money has simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone out of the oil-producers' pockets into those of the taxing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government's.  But I can't quite believe that the equilibrium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would work like that---it seems to me that an almost Le Chatelier's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect kicks in here, and less oil would be consumed.  That would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be bad, naturally.
</em><br>
<p>Why must the consumption of oil return to its previous level for economic 
<br>
harm to be prevented? What if I replace my aged boiler with a more efficient 
<br>
model since oil &quot;feels&quot; more expensive (it really isn't under my scenario). 
<br>
I'm using less oil and now I have more money for the movies and a US boiler 
<br>
making company just made a healthy sale to me. What if I choose an item on 
<br>
the grociery shelf that had 10g less plastic in its packaging because it is 
<br>
now a little cheaper than the equivalent item sitting next to it? (*)
<br>
<p>I don't remember Le Chatelier's principle, I'll have to go look it up! I 
<br>
think taxing income is far more harmful to the econonmy than taxing oil 
<br>
imports. I admit I don't (yet) know how to substantiate that opinion but your 
<br>
questions and comments are helping me think about it!
<br>
<p>Thanks Lee, and to the other contributers to this thread, I apologize for not 
<br>
addressing all your comments directly but I must revert to lurking for a few 
<br>
days.

(*) I have been developing a wood fired steam engine co-generation system in 
my spare time over the past too-many-to-count years and I suppose I must come 
clean and admit that I might have a selfish reason to see oil imports taxed! 
But hey! It would mean more jobs if I could turn the blinking thing into a 
product. :)  With heating oil at $1.50 a gallon its only another .50 to go to 
economic viability. Time to get back to work on the prototype...
