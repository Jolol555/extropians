Know what, that is where the &quot;new cold war&quot; comes in.
<br>
It takes military style spending and drive for things like a global
<br>
integrated information gathering, processing, management system to be
<br>
the deep pockets customers to drive technology through the rough spots.
<br>
<p>The soviet cold war spawned the space program.
<br>
&quot;Captain Osama Insano and the wacky iraqi packi's &quot; have spawned a drive
<br>
to build out a global &quot;mind&quot;.
<br>
<p>It takes the rasing of the general level of 3rd world living to bring
<br>
the other 5 billion consumers into the global economy to fuel demand.
<br>
The key is to keep the bubbles from exploding so fast that the whole
<br>
cake flops as it is rising and cooking.
<br>
<p>True all the old stuff is still good for something...technology
<br>
retooled/rebuilt   Agriculture is just now getting GPS, integrated
<br>
information management and as cost comes down a strange thing is
<br>
happening. &quot;everything old is becoming new again&quot;  Farms are migrating
<br>
from  medieval acerages where every bush has a name to farms of 25-150
<br>
square miles in size that have information systems that know every bush
<br>
by name.  Integrating nature/historical life with information/driven
<br>
life should drive a lot more consumption of information management
<br>
machinery.  Research/product biotech product development loops will also
<br>
be big consumers.  Afraid to say but true, the human element will also
<br>
have to be upgraded soon and that is going to take monumental
<br>
computational horsepower.
<br>
So moore's law has a lot of life left yet.

<em>&gt; Good article but forget about forgeting. Moores Law will be held as a

<em>&gt; standard, and will be remembered as the bright light of the glory days

</em><br>
<em>&gt; because there may be a practical limit, in electronics, for our epoch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other systems may come along, providing optical laser computing, or

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like I said, I will err on the side of pessimism today. Maybe the new

</em><br>
