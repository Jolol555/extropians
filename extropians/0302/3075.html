<p><em>&gt; Iran, 1953: When the government of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; nationalized the Anglo-Iranian oil company, the resulting sanctions on 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; the country – led by Great Britain and the United States – resulted in 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; economic hardship and political unrest. Fearing that such instability 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; could result in a communist takeover and concerned about the precedent 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; of nationalization on American oil companies elsewhere in the Middle 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; East, agents of the Central Intelligence Agency organized a military 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; coup in 1953, ousting the elected prime minister. The United States 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; returned the exiled Shah to Iran, where he ruled with an iron fist for 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; more than a quarter century. Tens of thousands of dissidents were 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; tortured and murdered by his dreaded SAVAK secret police, organized and 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; trained by the United States. The repression was largely successful in 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; wiping out the democratic opposition. The SAVAK was less successful in 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; infiltrating religious institutions, however, so when the revolution 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; finally took place, toppling the Shah in 1979, the formerly secular Iran 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; came under the leadership of virulently reactionary and anti-American 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Islamists. The result of the Islamic revolution was not only the end of 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; one of America’s strongest economic and strategic relationships in the 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Middle East, but also the hostage crisis of 1979-81, Iranian support for 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; anti-American terrorist groups, and a series of armed engagements in the 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Persian Gulf during the 1980s. Had the United States not overthrown 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Iran’s constitutional government in 1953 and replaced it with the 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; dictatorial Shah, there would not have been the Islamic Revolution and 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; its bloody aftermath.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I would have to agree that the US is simply reaping what it has sown. 
<br>
After the American backed Shah's removal from power in Iran, America's 
<br>
economic backing went immediately to Iraq and Saddam, Despite his violations 
<br>
of human rights.
<br>
<p>What puzzles me is that the US said prior to the invasion of Kuwait that the 
<br>
US had no intention of supplying military support in the event of an 
<br>
invasion. In addition to that, America only received backing from Saudi to 
<br>
mobilise to the gulf by producing satellite evidence that Saddam has amassed 
<br>
troops at Saudi's border. 
<br>
The evidence for this amassing of troops has been called into question.
<br>
<p>Help me out if you can on the above puzzles, because I would like to know 
<br>
what the facts are. 
<br>
