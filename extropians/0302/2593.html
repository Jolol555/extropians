<p><em>&gt; &gt; The very act of choosing, spread widely enough and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; freely enough, creates a power law distribution.
</em><br>
<p>If people vote for each other at random, which would
<br>
be one way of choosing, then the math is the same as
<br>
what happens if you give a thousand dollars to a thousand
<br>
people at random.  About one person gets 6 or so dollars,
<br>
and about .368 of the people get nothing (1/e).  I don't
<br>
think it's a &quot;power law&quot; exactly, but the hierarchy is
<br>
similar.  (This differs from giving a million dollars
<br>
at random to a thousand people, where almost everyone
<br>
gets nearly a thousand dollars.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Inequality occurs in large and unconstrained social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systems for the same reasons stop-and-go traffic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; occurs on busy roads, not because it is anyone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; goal, but because it is a reliable property that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emerges from the normal functioning of the system.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, however you'd model such freedom in a computer
<br>
program, it's quite clear that such inequality would
<br>
obtain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This fundamental insight forms the basis of much of Steven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pinker's social policy ruminations in THE BLANK SLATE.
</em><br>
<p>I keep reading over and over that the belief is widespread
<br>
in America that present difficulties in one's personal 
<br>
situation, including a low standard of living, will get
<br>
better.  I don't know a better word for that than optimism.
<br>
Of course, this can be a self-fulfilling prophesy,
<br>
especially if linked to a belief that one's actions
<br>
can put one ahead, even ahead of the average of one's
<br>
peers.
