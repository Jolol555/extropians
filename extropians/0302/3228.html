<p>
I hope John Wright doesn't mind my reproducing this email, but I thought it is of 
<br>
interest to the wta/extropian debates on consciousness.
<br>
<p>I myself do believe that it is possible to create an &quot;instant adult&quot; but that it is
<br>
definitely a &quot;new&quot; being (unless a quantum duplicate). Definitions of the maturity
<br>
of children should be decided on a case by case basis. Unlike many, I do not
<br>
believe that those who are insane should not be interfered with, or only if they
<br>
harm others. There may be a case where a being has voluntarily decided to enter
<br>
such a state for it to remain. This should be ascertained once if evidence is not
<br>
directly available. It can only be ascertained once by returning the individual to
<br>
sanity and receiving a confirmed consent/decision  to entering permanent insanity. 
<br>
(Similarly, with Tipler or any other &quot;resurrection/transference/splitting&quot; scenario, 
<br>
the dead from the past can be resurrected/transferred/copied/uploaded/split once, 
<br>
in order to seek their consent to or decision on whether they in fact wished to die 
<br>
permanently.)

<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>My dear Mr. Polymorph, I am pleased that you enjoyed my work, and I hope you 
<br>
will find the next two volumes of the tale live up to the promise of the 
<br>
beginning. THE PHOENIX EXULTANT is being published in April of this year, and 
<br>
THE GOLDEN TRANSCENDENCE several months after that. I have also written a work 
<br>
of high fantasy called LAST GUARDIAN OF EVERNESS, that may be published some 
<br>
time this year. 
<br>
<p>The difficulty with any legal definition of consent or coercion for a society 
<br>
with the technology to create and rewrite the contents of the mind, is that the 
<br>
process of education or programming the new mind must take place in a step-by-
<br>
step fashion. Even if it seems nearly instantaneous to an outside observer, to 
<br>
the mind being formed, each new layer of education or instruction will appear 
<br>
to be sequential to the previous layer, that is, the new information will be 
<br>
described, or the new lessons be presented, to the undeveloped mind that is 
<br>
aware only of the previous layers. 
<br>
<p>Since not all information or education can be presented at once, the new mind, 
<br>
no matter how formed, will always pass through a stage when it is unwise and 
<br>
inexperienced: this means the new mind will not be in a position to assess the 
<br>
wisdom or utility of learning the next layer of lessons, or receiving the next 
<br>
group of memories or instructions. 
<br>
<p>In other words, there will always be children in this world, no matter how they 
<br>
are made, and they will always be under the government and authority of their 
<br>
parents or makers. While nature has provided the human heart with at least some 
<br>
tenderness toward our children, any tenderness we may have toward our creations 
<br>
will be a matter of deliberate moral injunction. 
<br>
<p>The same line of reasoning applies to senility and madness: no matter how it is 
<br>
housed, any mental system might suffer damage or entropic decay that will 
<br>
render it unfit for self-government, unable to correct its own errors. 
<br>
<p>In the imaginary commonwealth of the far future I envision in my novel, the 
<br>
authorities of that day and age do not interfere with the dementia of broken 
<br>
mental constructs, until they damage another: of course, I am also supposing 
<br>
the wisdom of that age is so great, that the majority of citizens, whatever 
<br>
bodies they wear, however their minds are housed, have taken prudent legal 
<br>
steps to assign power of attorney over their affairs to trusted associates or 
<br>
loved ones, who can correct their mental disorganization, should madness or 
<br>
senility strike. As will be seen in the next two volumes, this system is not 
<br>
without flaws. 
<br>
<p>Yours, John C. Wright, esq.
