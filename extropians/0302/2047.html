<br>
neo-fascist libertarian-anti-welfare view of relationships 
<br>
<p>Avatar,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assume that is a screenname.  Who ever you are that is an amazing 
<br>
statement.  Let me break it down.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You call Heinlein a neo-fascist.  Now fascist comes from Mussolini the 
<br>
former Communist from Italy that started a clearly socialist/communist party. 
<br>
&nbsp;So for simplification I will generalize and put down that you call Heinlein 
<br>
a &quot;socialist&quot; libertarian-anti-welfare view or a person having that view.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is a libertarian?  I gather from discussing libertarianism 
<br>
with my libertarian buddies and reading Ayn Rand that a suitable one word 
<br>
synonym for libertarian would be capitalist.  So now we have you saying that 
<br>
Heinlein had a &quot;socialist capitalist&quot; -anti-welfare view.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpreting anti-welfare is a little tougher in that welfare or as I 
<br>
suspect you really mean the welfare state is associated with wide variety of 
<br>
political types.  Let me use.... -- no, I won't attempt to translate your use 
<br>
of the anti-welfare term.  I will put that down as (was it Korzybski that 
<br>
used the phrase?) &quot;spellable noise.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end I have to believe you are saying that Heinlein had a 
<br>
socialist capitalist &quot;spellable noise&quot; view of the world?  But I ask you how 
<br>
can the man be a socialist capitalist at the same time?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me are you at all aware that Heinlein ran for the legislature of 
<br>
the state of California as a member of the socialist wing of the Democrat 
<br>
Party in the late 30s and that he never publicly repudiated that position 
<br>
insofar as I know?  It is true.  He was an admirer H. G. Wells and employee 
<br>
of a Sinclair Lewis ran political organization.  In fact Mr. Heinlein wrote 
<br>
extensively for Mr. Lewis organization's publication.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However Mr. Heinlein often portrayed positions in fiction that we 
<br>
believe depicted a libertarian viewpoint.  Still Mr. Heinlein remained a very 
<br>
private man.  When he became a writer of fiction he stopped his advocacy 
<br>
positions except privately.  For the most part we don't know exactly what his 
<br>
political or religious beliefs were.  We do know he bristled if accused of 
<br>
privately believing the positions put forth in fiction.  As I carried on a 
<br>
pen pal relationship with Mrs Heinlein (she handled fan relationships for 
<br>
him) for almost twenty years.  In a few instances I believe I have a 
<br>
glimmering of what some of his private positions were.  However as he kept 
<br>
those private I shall respect his silence.
<br>
