The key to speed reading, which most systems rely on, is to read a
<br>
group of words at once as a single concept, rather than treating each
<br>
word as separate concepts which need to be assembled together.
<br>
<p>&quot;The long blue and green eighteen wheeled truck&quot;
<br>
&quot;the sky was a cauldron of slate and steel greys&quot;
<br>
<p>A speed reader will learn to look at phrases like these with one
<br>
glance, rather than word by word, and understand them single concepts.
<br>
<p>This is one of the drawbacks of alphabetical/phonemic writing systems
<br>
versus ideographic. While the ideographic systems can convey complex
<br>
concepts with very few, or single, symbols, they require memory
<br>
training to be able to recall hundreds of thousands of ideograms to do
<br>
so. Languages like English can be used with only a few hundred words
<br>
while more complex words can be puzzled out because they tend to be
<br>
assmbled from more complex words, generally of a root language like
<br>
latin, greek, or german.

<em>&gt; &gt; Let me know thanks, Nate

<em>&gt; About 20 years ago I took a speed-reading course similar to the old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Evelyn Wood&quot; speed reading course. As I recall I was able to roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triple my reading speed to something like 1500-1800 words/minute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say 3000+ words/min is possible, but I never reached that level.) I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impressed with my increase in reading speed, but since then it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dropped back to probably about 600-700 words/minute. I think my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed dropped back because I actually enjoy the English language;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading definitely hindered my ability to appreciate well written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if I was able to comprehend the author's meanings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The trick to speed reading is learning how not to &quot;sound out&quot; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in one's mind as one reads. But as above it pleases me to sound out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words in my mind as I read, and so I lost interest in speed reading.
