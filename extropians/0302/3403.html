<em>&gt; &gt;At some early stages of the Von Neumann probe dispersal, this

<em>&gt; I would tend to agree with this.  The entire von Neumann probe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dispersal scenario seems very boring.  So you conquer every bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of available matter -- so what?  You either have a very dumb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanical galaxy ruled by &quot;we shall control everything&quot; bots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or you have something more alive and evolving.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you suppose that after everything in our galaxy is 
<br>
converted to computronium, or as near as it can get, that
<br>
the galaxy'll be a bore?  Think of all the thinking that
<br>
will be going on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That allows scenarios like the Klingon or Romulan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilizations to evolve.  That seems much more interesting.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like science fiction, to me.  Like Brin's boring
<br>
uplift scenarios (I haven't read the books, and they may
<br>
indeed be lotsa fun), but alien species?  C'mon.  On this
<br>
list it's commonplace that any technology that gets past
<br>
a very primitive level goes singularity---and the least
<br>
that I mean by that is that it becomes silicon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There *will* be a situation where &quot;everything&quot; is used up.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may happen very very far in our future when we have had to resolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether or not the Romulan or Klingon civilization perspectives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might indeed be best.  I don't know.... The expansion of civilizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fully utilize the resources available to them was made by Dyson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 40+ years ago.
</em><br>
<p>The scenario I've been imagining for the last 10 years or
<br>
so, and I don't recall that I've seen it refuted, is &quot;The
<br>
Wind from Earth&quot;.  In this, the whole solar system is
<br>
converted to living tissue in just the next two hundred
<br>
years or so.  (This is quite in line with other people's
<br>
singularity scenarios.)
<br>
<p>Then this center of life spreads out at just about the
<br>
speed of light.  The first (highly intelligent) probes
<br>
reach the nearby stars and convert it to living tissue
<br>
also.  That which is Dead, i.e., not yet converted to
<br>
Life, consists only of atoms outside the expanding
<br>
sphere at any given time T.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, at a given radius R from Earth---or perhaps
<br>
from Jupiter---local Life fights a constant struggle
<br>
for existence.  What to do about the algorithms from 
<br>
Earth?
<br>
<p>Yes, they're newer and more powerful, and they've
<br>
been beamed straight from the center, but can they
<br>
be trusted?  How severely do they affect local
<br>
identity?  The dilemma: if you don't use them, then
<br>
you fall further and further behind, but if you do
<br>
use them, you may lose your identity.
<br>
<p>I see this technological gradient as being probably
<br>
permanent:  always near the center will be the most
<br>
advanced algorithms (entities), because kilotons of
<br>
matter cannot even begin to explore all the possible
<br>
algorithms of the future.  A human brain could easily
<br>
run on a 1cc device, and no telling what could run
<br>
on a Jupiter brain.  But the Jupiter brain's program
<br>
(its algorithms) will hardly be optimal.  So large
<br>
is the search space that perhaps optimality will
<br>
never be within any finite time.
