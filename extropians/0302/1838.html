<em>&gt; &quot;So you believe that &quot;our unrivaled power to crush our foes&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what will draw the Middle East into freedom and democracy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really? Isn't it more likely to increasingly lead to the US and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all it stands for being hated as the worst sort of tyranny? Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we reduced to &quot;we will crush you if you resist&quot;?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amazing. What brought Germany to freedom and democracy? What kept South
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Korea from falling into a Communist sponsored nightmare in 1950? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kept all of Europe from falling under the boot heel of Nazism?
</em><br>
<p>(1) To compare the Middle-East of today with Europe of the 30s/40s or 
<br>
Asia of the 50s/60s is not very sensible. The political structures and 
<br>
history, the different interests, the influence of religion, ethnical 
<br>
groups, the oil business, etc. are very different.
<br>
<p>(2) Even successful actions in the past can not flatly justify current 
<br>
actions; neither morally, nor technically. Every action stands for its 
<br>
own. To put it simple: Doing something good and sensible in the past 
<br>
doesn't excuse doing something wrong and stupid now :-)
<br>
<p>(3) The question, if a) a war, b) now will really solve more problems 
<br>
then messing things up, is still unanswered. As far as I've understood 
<br>
the Middle-East experts I've heard, they predict a rather uncontrollable 
<br>
outburst of violence in the whole region, as well as a much higher risk 
<br>
of terrorist actions. Or to refer to the historical events you mentioned; 
<br>
this war could turn into a second vietnam.
