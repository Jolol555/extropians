<em>&gt; I disagree with Greg.  I don't see the publicity as all that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damaging.  
</em><br>
<p>Robert, I think you need to spend more time around what Sasha used to
<br>
call &quot;the normals.&quot;  This language will gag them:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;--- quote from espn.com article ---
<br>
<p>&quot;After what I saw and experienced, I just can't contain myself any
<br>
longer,&quot; Hamon told the Daily News by phone Tuesday. &quot;I want the whole
<br>
world to know what they've done to Ted. This was absolutely horrifying.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hamon told the newspaper he was &quot;appalled&quot; by the cluttered conditions
<br>
inside the facility, then gave the Daily News the following account of
<br>
entering the containment room where Williams' body is stored:
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>&quot;I was a little taken aback at the sanitary conditions because of my
<br>
experience in the mortuary business,&quot; Sgrillo told the newspaper when
<br>
reached in Phoenix. &quot;But what really concerned me were the dangerously
<br>
low levels of nitrogen in each of the tanks. It was when I asked
<br>
(Lemler) about that he said: 'Tour's over!'
<br>
<p>&quot;When I asked them about this whole process, they said: 'We don't
<br>
promise anything. We don't know what's on the other end.' &quot;
<br>
<p>When reached by the Daily News on Tuesday, Lemler said he does not
<br>
recall the visit by Hamon and Sgrillo and denied that there are problems
<br>
with nitrogen levels in the Alcor facility. When asked by the newspaper
<br>
about its sanitary conditions, he said &quot;no comment.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I just can't believe people believe in this,&quot; Sgrillo told the Daily
<br>
News, &quot;that their loved ones can be brought back to life. Are they
<br>
really that stupid?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;--- end quote ---
<br>
<p>The vast majority of male Americans look on ESPN as a primary source of
<br>
important information -- information that matters to them and that they
<br>
spend *huge* amounts of time discussing among themselves.  As much as
<br>
you know about molecular biology, your average bright American male
<br>
knows about professional sports.
