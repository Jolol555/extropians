RE: the extropic aspirations to life extension and life 
<br>
enhancement.
<br>
<p>The following excerpt is from a 2001 physiology text
<br>
- &quot;Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems&quot; 4th Edn
<br>
&nbsp;- Lauralee Sherwood.
<br>
<p>I thought this might serve as bit of a primer for some extropes
<br>
*interested in* the Xenotrans and tissue engineering stuff but
<br>
perhaps not yet specifically up to speed.  I *like* useful
<br>
primers myself and any crappy emailed ones (which some 
<br>
may see this as) can be easily ignored or dealt with by the
<br>
delete button.
<br>
<p>There would be a few aspects in which the following is out of
<br>
date (eg. in stem cells the term pluripotent rather than totipotent
<br>
is more often used now). I'd be interested in what out-of-date
<br>
observations any others might see as well. 
<br>

XENOTRANSPLANTATION and TISSUE ENGINEERING:
A Quest for Replacement Parts.
Kidney failure, extensive burns, surgical removal of a cancerous
breast, an arm mangled in an accident - though our bodies are 
remarkable and serve us well, sometimes a body part is defective,
injured beyond repair, or lost in situations such as these. In
addition to the loss of the quality of life for the affected individuals,
billions of dollars are spent to treat patients with lost, permanently
damaged, or failing organs, accounting for about half of the total
health-care costs in the United States. Ideally, when the body 
suffers an irreparable loss, new, permanent replacement parts
could be substituted to restore normal function and appearance.
Fortunately, this possibility is moving rapidly from the realm of 
science fiction to reality of scientific progress. 
One solution for replacing damaged or lost parts is implantation
of synthetic devices, such as artificial joints or artificial heart 
valves. More advanced synthetic devices even interface with the
brain. An example is a surgically implanted electronic device that
enables a deaf person to &quot;hear&quot; by converting sound waves into
electrical signals in the nerve pathways that carry information to
the brain for sound perception. Even though remarkable advances 
have been made in this field, no synthetic device manufactured 
thus far can perform the functions of a body part as effectively as
the normal, healthy original part...
Another solution to organ failure is transplantation of organs such
as kidneys, hearts, and livers from donors (recently deceased in
the case of most donated organs) to patients whose survival 
depends on a healthy replacement. Over the last two decades 
organ transplantation has become almost commonplace. The 
major obstacle limiting the number of transplantations is not a
lack of technical capability but a shortage of donor organs. 
Waiting lists for replacement organs outstrip the number of 
organs available as much as tenfold. 
Because of the limitations of implanting synthetic devices and
transplanting donor organs, some researchers are exploring 
two alternative methods for replacing body parts that are no 
longer serviceable: xenotransplantation and tissue engineering.
Interest in XENOTRANSPLANTATION, (transplanting 
organs from one species to another), is growing not only
because of the shortage of human donors but because our
technical capabilities have improved to the point that this 
technique is now becoming feasible. One of the major hurdles
to xenotransplantation has been the swift rejection of the 
animal organ by the human recipient's body. The patient's
immune system, recognizing the donated animal organ as 
'foreign,' immediately launches a destructive attack on the
transplanted organ.
Pioneering efforts on several fronts are breaking down this
barrier to xenotransplantation. First, researchers now have a
more thorough understanding of the underlying immune 
mechanisms that cause rejection of transplanted tissue. This
knowledge has led to better immunosuppressive drugs (drugs
that suppress the immune system's attack on the transplanted
organ). Even recipients of human donor organs must be 
treated with immunosuppressive drugs because of the
differences in 'self-identity markers' found on the surfaces of
the donor's and the recipient's cells. Because the differences
in these cells surface markers are much greater between 
humans and animals, more powerful drugs must be used to 
prevent the rejection of xenotransplants.
An unfortunate side effect of immunosuppressive drugs is the
reduced ability of the patient's immune system to defend 
against potential disease-causing microorganisms, or 
pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses. To avoid depleting
the transplant recipient's defence capabilities, a second 
advance toward xenotranplantation has been the development
of transgenic animals through genetic engineering. A transgenic
animal possesses not only its own genes but also some
specific genes of another species that have been artificially 
introduced. Scientists have bred transgenic pigs that carry 
human genes for use as organ donors for xenotransplantation.
Pigs were chosen because they are easy to breed and raise
and because their organs are comparable in size as well as 
anatomically and physiologically similar to human organs. The
goal is to trick the human xenotransplant recipient's immune 
system into viewing the pig organ as human, thus reducing the
extent of the immunological attack and minimizing the need
for immunosuppressive drugs. 
Even as the technical barriers to xenotransplantion are 
crumbling, however, several obstacles to continued progress
in this area are emerging. Scientists are vigorously debating
the likelihood that xenotransplantation will introduce new 
infectious agents from an animal source into the human 
population. Opponents of xenotransplantation fear that an 
undetected pathogen lurking in a donor animal could cause
infection in a human recipient and spread from there into the
general population. The risk of cross-species infections is 
magnified by the fact that the immunosuppressive drugs used
to minimize rejection of the xenotransplant reduce the ability
of the recipient to fend off any potential pathogens that might
be present in the donated organ. To reduce the potential for
spread of disease from pigs to human recipients, donor
animals are now raised under conditions to maintain them
free of specific diseases to which humans are known to be
susceptible. Yet, there is still concern that pigs may harbor 
viral stowaways that are harmless to the animals but could
cause as-yet-unknown diseases when abnormally introduced
into a xenotranplanted patient. One new encouraging study 
demonstrated, however, that patients who had received
living pig tissue, as in skin grafts, over the past 12 years
showed no evidence of infection by one such recently 
idnetified viral stowaway.
Even thought individuals might be willing to take this risk for
the benefit of a life-saving transplant, an important ethical 
dliemma is whether society as a whole should be placed at
risk of the potential spread of a xenotranplant-derived 
disease throughout the population. Another ethical concern
raised by some is the exploitation of animals as sources of 
spare parts for humans. Other counter that humans already 
routinely kill pigs for another self-serving purpose- for food.
Against a backdrop of lively public debate about such 
scientific challenges, public health risks, and ethical issues,
federal guidelines have been developed that permit limited 
pig-to-human transplantation to proceed, although the use 
of nonhuman primate tissue has been temporarily halted.
Under these guidelines, the number of individuals and the 
types of disorders for which xenotransplantation is being
utilized as a treatment are continuing to grow. Early
samples include treatment for specific degenerative brain
disorders, diabetes, acute liver failure, damaged heart
valves, and extensive burns.
Besides xenotransplantation, the second frontier in 
replacement parts is TISSUE ENGINEERING - growing
new tissues in the laboratory that can be implanted to
serve as permanent replacements for body parts that 
cannot be repaired. The era of tissue engineering is being
ushered in by advances in cell biology, plastic
manufacturing, and computer graphics. 
Most human cells can already be cultured; that is, when
removed from the body, they will continue to thrive and
reproduce in laboratory dishes when supplied with 
appropriate nutrients and other supportive materials. Now
researchers are working towards growing specific tissues
and even whole organs in the laboratory for use as 
replacement parts. Using computer-aided designs, highly
pure, dissolvable plastics are shaped into three-
dimensional molds or scaffoldings that mimic the structure
of a particular tissue or organ. The plastic mold is then
'seeded' with the desired cell types, which are coaxed, 
through the application of appropriate nourishing and
stimulatory chemicals, into multiplying and assembling into
the desired tissue. After the biodegradable plastic 
scaffolding dissolves, only the newly generated tissue 
remains, ready to be implanted into a patient as a
permanent, living replacement part. 
To prevent rejection by the immune system, without the
necessity of lifelong immunosuppressive drugs, the plastic
mold could be seeded, if possible, with appropriate cells
harvested from the recipient. Often, however, because
of the very need for a replacement part, the patient does
not have any of the appropriate cells to seed the synthetic
scaffold. This is what makes the recent isolation of 
embryonic STEM CELLS so exciting. Embryonic
stem cells are the &quot;mother cells&quot; resulting from the early
divisions of a fertilized egg. Embryonic stem cells are 
totipotent (meaning &quot;having total potential&quot;), because
they have the potential of becoming every cell type in the
body. During development, these undifferentiated cells
give rise to the many different highly differentiated, 
specialized cells of the body. As the stem cells divide
over the course of development, they branch off into the
various specialty tracks under the guidance of particular
genetically controlled chemical signals. Some stem cells
are forced along a career path of specialising as muscle
cells, while others are irreversibly cast in lifelong roles
as various other specialized cells.
Now, for the first time, researchers have succeeded in
isolating embryonic stem cells and maintaining them 
indefinitely in an undifferentiated state in culture. 
Furthermore, early experiments suggest that these cells
have the ability to differentiate into particular cells when
exposed to the appropriate chemical signals. Further 
stem cell research has far-reaching implications that
could revolutionise the practice of medicine in the
twenty-first century. As scientists gradually learn to
prepare the right cocktail of chemical signals to direct
the undifferentiated cells into the desired cell types, they
will have to grow customized tissues and eventually 
whole, made-to-order replacement organs, such as
livers, hearts, and kidneys.
Through genetic engineering, these stem cells could be
converted into 'univeral' seed cells that would be 
immunologically acceptable to any recipient. Thus, the
vision of tissue engineers is to create universal 
replacement parts that could be put into any patient
who needs them without fear of transplant rejection or 
use of troublesome immunosuppressive drugs.
Following are some of the tissue engineers' early 
accomplishments and future predictions:
ENGINEERED SKIN PATCHES have already been
used to treat victims of severe burns.
LABORATORY-GROWN CARTILAGE has
already been successfully implanted in experimental
animals. Examples include artificial heart valves, ears,
and noses.
Considerable progress has been made on building 
ARTIFICIAL BONE. 
ARTIFICIAL ARTERIES composed entirely of
human cells have already been produced but not yet
tested for function and durability in humans.
TISSUE-ENGINEERED SCAFFOLDING to 
promote nerve regeneration is currently undergoing
testing in animals.
Progress has been made on growing two 
complicated organs, the LIVER and the PANCREAS.
Another tissue-engineering challenge under 
development is the growth of completely NATURAL 
REPLACEMENT BREASTS for implantation
following surgical removal of cancerous breasts.
ENGINEERED JOINTS will be used as a living,
more satisfactory alternative to the plastic and metal
devices used as replacements today.
Ultimately, complex body parts such as arms and
hands will be produced in the laboratory for
attachment as needed.
Thus, tissue engineering holds the promise that 
damaged body parts can be replaced with the best 
alternative, a laboratory-grown version of &quot;the real
thing&quot;.  
Despite this potential, stem cell research is fraught 
with ethical controversy because of the source of 
the cells. These embryonic stem cells were isolated
from embryos from an abortion clinic and from
unused embryos from an in-vitro fertility clinic. 
Because federal policy #3# currently prohibits use
of public funding to support research involving 
human embryos, the scientists who isolated these
embryonic stem cells relied on private money.
Public policy makers, scientists, and bioethicists
are now faced with balancing a host of ethical issues
against the tremendous potential clinical application
of stem cell research. Such research will proceed at
a much faster pace if federal money is available to
support it. In a controversial decision, federal policy
makers recently issued guidelines permitting the use
of government funds to support studies using established
lines of human embryonic stem cells but not research 
aimed at deriving new cell lines. This decision was based
on the premise that investigators using already established
embryonic stem cell lines would not entail destroying
embryos for scientific purposes.
As a possible alternative to using the controversial
totipotent embryonic stem cells for tissue engineering, 
other researchers are exploring the possibility of 
exploiting tissue-specific stem cells harvested from various
adult tissues. These specialised stem cells do not have
the complete developmental potential of embryonic stem 
cells, but partially differentiated stem cells from adults
have been coaxed into producing a wider variety of cells
than originally thought possible. For example, provided 
the right supportive environment, neural (nerve-cell 
producing) stem cells have given rise to blood cells. Thus,
researchers may be able to tap into the more limited but
still versatile developmental potential of specialised stem
cells in the adult human body.
