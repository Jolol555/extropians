<p><em>&gt; I did not read Tegmark's paper. But, yes, if by entropy you mean a

</em><br>
<p>I don't believe this is the case.  MWI is a fully deterministic theory.
<br>
You can evolve the wave function arbitrarily far backwards or forwards
<br>
in time by the Schrodinger equation.  Therefore information is neither
<br>
created nor destroyed, and the total entropy of the multiverse never
<br>
changes.  I believe this is equivalent to saying that the time evolution
<br>
is unitary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can see it in many ways. The branching structure, i.e., is, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself, irreversibility. Or, if you prefer, it is asymmetry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between past and future. So we can also say that MWI broke its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own and unique law: the time symmetrical Schroedinger equation.
</em><br>
<p>Tegmark argues that universes join as well as branch.  We may have
<br>
multiple pasts as well as multiple futures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can also put it in different terms. MWI supposes there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication between different worlds. Hence, imo, it supposes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no 'interference' between different components of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wave function (at least after the splitting occurs). But having 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no 'interference' means a transition from an original 'pure' state 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a 'mixture'. And we know, from a Von Neumann theorem, that in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the change from a 'pure' state to a 'mixture' the entropy increases. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (On the contrary the evolution described by the Schroedinger equation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is unitary and the entropy is invariant).
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps we mean different things by MWI?  In my view the MWI is simply
<br>
the position that Schroedinger evolution is the only thing that happens,
<br>
there is no state function reduction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not know if MWI 'maximize', globally or locally, the entropy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase. And, perhaps, a 'comparative' calculation is not easy. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because there are many different theoretical models of measurement 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or 'collapse'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In any case it is possible, in general, to link the effective gain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of information to the difference betwwen the initial entropy and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the final one (Brillouin rule).    
</em><br>
<p>Of course, from the local perspective of any one branch of the MWI,
<br>
entropy does increase, as we gain information about where we are in
<br>
the multiverse.
