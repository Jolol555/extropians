</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; ...and this is a new sensation for you?
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; Devil's advocate: it's not reliable.  Not all the answers are out there,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; and even if they are, finding them can be impossible if you don't know
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; knowledge - albeit a potentially very powerful one when it works.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; A common misconception among isolates.  I've heard legends about
</em><br>
<em> &gt; information that's supposedly &quot;not online&quot;, but have never managed to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; locate any myself.  I've concluded that this is merely a rationalization
</em><br>
<em> &gt; for inadequate search skills; isolates can't find some piece of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; information and so they conclude it's &quot;not online&quot;, which any diligent
</em><br>
<em> &gt; epistemological scrutiny easily shows to be a nonsensical conception.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; If information exists it is necessarily online somewhere.
</em><br>
<p>Provably untrue.  There exists some information which has been written
<br>
down on paper, but never recorded in any electronic form.  (Organic
<br>
neural networks not counting: those are more chemical than electronic.)
<br>
And then there is information that is not even recorded that much.  For
<br>
example: what is the layout of the room I sit in while I type this?  To
<br>
me, at least, this is not mere data, for I must use it to navigate the
<br>
room.  And yet this information is not - at this moment, at least -
<br>
available online.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The URL,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Uniform Resource Locator, is precisely that; uniform.  Anything which
</em><br>
<em> &gt; cannot be located by a URL is, by definition, not a resource.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Uniform&quot; is not &quot;universal&quot;.  It was established to consolidate the
<br>
format of addresses of information; that is not the same as saying it
<br>
includes everything.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Thus, when isolates say that finding certain information is &quot;impossible&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; if you &quot;don't know the proper terms&quot;, they betray a poor epistemological
</em><br>
<em> &gt; grounding; &quot;finding information&quot; is in fact *synonymous* with
</em><br>
<em> &gt; discovering the proper Google search terms for that information.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but that just proves my point.  (There's also the act of finding the
<br>
correct link within Google's results, which could be several pages into
<br>
the results.)  Different statements of equivalent terms are equivalently
<br>
true or false, and may be used to emphasize and illustrate different
<br>
facets of the claimed facts.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; As for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; claiming that Google is an &quot;assistant to classical learning and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; knowledge&quot;, this ignores the fact that all classical learning and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; knowledge is available through Google.  (By definition; anything that is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; not only *not found* on Google but *not findable* through Google, even
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in principle, is not &quot;knowledge&quot;.)
</em><br>
<p>Erroneous definition.  Surely, how to find Google itself if you are not
<br>
already at Google is a piece of knowledge.  Not to mention, how to turn
<br>
on a computer, how to use a Web browser, and other such prerequisite
<br>
skills to using Google.  (Some of which, granted, may be findable
<br>
through Google, but not all.)
<br>
<p>Plus, I refer by this &quot;classical learning and knowledge&quot; to the
<br>
quasi-intuitive pattern recognition and deduction taught long before
<br>
Google's existence.  You can find specific facts through Google, and
<br>
using them build up this learning in some fields if you know how, but
<br>
this is not the same as the learning itself being available through
<br>
Google.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The notion of &quot;supergoogular&quot; information is not only empirically
</em><br>
<em> &gt; unverified but epistemologically nonsensical, with the only conceivable
</em><br>
<em> &gt; interpretation being information which can only be googled using special
</em><br>
<em> &gt; keywords.  No such keywords having ever been provided, we can conclude
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that so-called supergoogular phenomena are fantasies concocted by
</em><br>
<em> &gt; isolates to cover their resentment of superior Google skills.
</em><br>
<p>Circular reasoning.  You assume that everything is available through
<br>
Google, therefore you conclude that everything is available through
<br>
Google.  If you do not understand why your reasoning is therefore
<br>
rejected outright, you might want to google for &quot;circular reasoning&quot;.
