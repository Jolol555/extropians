<p><p><em>&gt; one needs to be skeptical of claims of a golden clean energy age.
</em><br>
<p>Sure. But we have seen, how the massive use of tax money can push even a 
<br>
technology as uneconomical as nuclear fission into a kind of virtual 
<br>
profitability.

<br>
<p>Approximate Thermal Energy release
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coal - ~6150 kilowatt-hours(kWh)/ton 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uranium - 2 x 10E9 kWh/ton
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, exactly, makes a material with nearly 1 million times as much
<br>
energy as coal 'uneconomical'  Is uranium 1 million times more difficult to
<br>
mine and obtain?  I don't think so. Is uranium 1 million times more
<br>
expensive to transport, process, and use than coal?  Nope again.  It is the
<br>
regulating and limitations placed on Nuclear power by politicians and scared
<br>
ignorant luddite laymen who perpetuate this nonsense, and subsequently
<br>
endorse coal power, natural gas power, etc etc which kill far more people
<br>
every year than nuclear energy has ever killed in its entire existence.
<br>
Coal mining is still (and always has been) the single most dangerous
<br>
occupation.  Tankers   full of LNG have the explosive capacity of a nuclear
<br>
bomb, and they sit in ports with single hulled tanks.  Natural gas leaks and
<br>
fires kill some 1,000 people in the US alone every year.  It is estimated
<br>
that thousands of people die every year from the inhalitation of air
<br>
pollution particulates caused from fossil fuel combustion, the largest
<br>
source of which are coal and oil burning power plants.  Greens profess that
<br>
the CO2 released by such combustion is contributing a human caused global
<br>
climate change, which could cause millions of deaths in 3rd world countries
<br>
through famine.  This luddite propoganda hijacked the natural tendancy of
<br>
technological progress to produce safer and more economical energy
<br>
production mechanisms and destroyed the growth of a nuclear power based
<br>
industry, and has instead forced the most energy intensive nations (which
<br>
also produce the majority of the worlds food supply) to rely on oil imports
<br>
from corrupt despotic theocratic murderous regimes.  So the anti-nuclear
<br>
activists not only caused global warming, but directly contributed to the
<br>
global instability and rise to power of middle eastern oil controlling
<br>
murderers, and subseqnetly set in action the events leading to the Gulf War
<br>
and the likely upcoming war with Iraq.  Your perpetuation of this
<br>
anti-nuclear nonsense contributes to these deaths and is anti-extropian in
<br>
the extreme.  Your preconcieved idealogy of 'nuclear bad' flies in the face
<br>
of reason and logic, and is killing people.  More energy is present in the
<br>
uranium left over in coal ash than was generated by the burning of the
<br>
billions of tons of coal that produced that ash.  Not to mention, coal does
<br>
not spontaneoulsy combust into CO2 and H20, but Uranium, whether mined or
<br>
not, is still going to decay radioactively and produce energy in the
<br>
process.  
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
<br>
<p>&quot;Consequently, the energy content of nuclear fuel released in coal
<br>
combustion is more than that of the coal consumed! Clearly, coal-fired power
<br>
plants are not only generating electricity but are also releasing nuclear
<br>
fuels whose commercial value for electricity production by nuclear power
<br>
plants is over $7 trillion, more than the U.S. national debt. This figure is
<br>
based on current nuclear utility fuel costs of 7 mils per kWh, which is
<br>
about half the cost for coal. Consequently, significant quantities of
<br>
nuclear materials are being treated as coal waste, which might become the
<br>
cleanup nightmare of the future, and their value is hardly recognized at
<br>
all.&quot;
