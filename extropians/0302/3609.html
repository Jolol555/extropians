Emlyn:
<br>
<em>&gt;I think both Steve and Amara are talking about a more general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;propensity in people toward letting fear dominate their thinking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and thus behaviour. They're not talking specifically about mad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survivalism.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p>However, I am not sure the word 'letting' is the right word;
<br>
it looks like &quot;default&quot; behavior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The problem is with a general trend toward a focus on safety and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;security, rising from fear, in the west. It comes out in all kinds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of funny little ways,
</em><br>
<p><p>..these 'funny' little ways to me are not funny. I see precious time
<br>
passing and precious lives spent.
<br>
<p>I would be so happy to see Spike thinking about ways of boosting
<br>
rockets for our explorations of the universe. Instead I am
<br>
distressed to see him analyzing how subways are vulnerable and
<br>
unsafe. (Does that help you understand my comments Spike?)
<br>
<p>Whether or not Spike's comments were driven by fear (which I doubt),
<br>
one sees fear driving many of the topics on our mailing lists, as
<br>
well as comments by strangers speaking in public places, in
<br>
newspapers, on the radio, at the corner market, and so on. People
<br>
are bombarding each other with words about safety, security,
<br>
terrorist, destruction, weapons. Even though governments are expert
<br>
at it, notice that governments are not as necessary now to act as
<br>
fear-triggers because now people have learned how to apply the
<br>
fear-triggers amongst themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It also comes out in more sinister ways. Our government (here
</em><br>
<p>and here and other places
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And now, we've had the growing example of the mother of all scare
</em><br>
<em>&gt;campaigns, beginning just after September 11 and continuing, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increased frenzy, at the present moment. The War of Terror is a war
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on a concept. &quot;Terror&quot; is a difficult enemy to pin down, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scares the willies out of simple folk (seemingly about 80% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population). Now we're about to go to war with Iraq, which I wont go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into here, suffice it to say that the fear tactics being used by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government are constant, and fairly unsubtle. There is a campaign
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asking us to look out for terrorists in our midst, and report on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them to the government, with the slogan &quot;Be alert, not alarmed&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, U.S too (from what I saw and experienced in the U.S., still
<br>
learning about Italy, although I could provide some good rants already)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The mania in question is an obsession with personal safety.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p>Although I am not as sure as you, that the obsession I see with
<br>
personal safety is consciously driven by oneself. It looks more to
<br>
me that it's unconsciously driven with a steady influx of triggers
<br>
from external sources.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;How can you reconcile an ideology of individualism, optimism, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom, with networks of civilian spies, massive military
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mobilisation, and the general and ongoing degradation of freedoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that have come in the ensuing years?
</em><br>
<p>You can't.
<br>
<p>Thanks, Emlyn, your words were alot better than mine.
<br>
<p>Amara
