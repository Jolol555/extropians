<em>&gt; &gt; Do you think that more than half of the professional

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What a fascinating question!  I would love to say yes, but I rather suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not.  What I WOULD say is that if you surveyed the best and the brightest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;current cosmologists (leaving aside the question of how you choose them),

</em><br>
<em>&gt;currently accepted, is inconsistent with one or more observations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universe&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I bet the figure would be as close to zero percent as never mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The big problem in the sciences is that scientists are only human. 90% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them are dull-witted sheep. (An observation that seriously rattled me when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first started having dealings with professional scientists.) Of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remainders, the actual innovators, there are always going to be a fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt;percentage that have a vested interest in the current theory, either because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they helped invent it and have gained status thereby, or because they have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grant or other money source tied to particular lines of investigation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;current theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As a result, even in the presense of overwhelming evidence to the contrary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an old theory keeps going until the number of dissenting voices reaches some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;critical mass, after which the global scientific perspective changes, almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overnight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This makes such questions as &quot;would 20% of scientists agree...&quot; a poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;measurment of theory credibility, since (most) scientists do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;independantly hold opinions, but do so in consensus.
</em><br>
<p>You obviously don't understand how science works. Emotion, prejudice, and 
<br>
gut feelings may play an important role early on, but eventually, all of 
<br>
that gets burned off in the crucible of science. Solid (and preferably 
<br>
replicable) evidence is absolute king in the scientific world. NOTHING 
<br>
stands against that for
<br>
very long.
<br>
<p>And that and only that is why virtually all cosmologists today accept the 
<br>
big bang as the correct theory of the origin of the universe. We now have 
<br>
the specific evidence in hand predicted by the big bang and no other 
<br>
theory. They include time dilation in the decay curves of distant type Ia 
<br>
supernova, an increase in temperature of the cosmic background radiation 
<br>
(CMB) in the distant and early universe compared to today's universe, the 
<br>
fundamental peak and its acoustic harmonic overtones in the anisotropy 
<br>
spectrum of the CMB, including the predicted dampening tail, and partial 
<br>
polarization of the CMB of just the right kind that the big bang predicts. 
<br>
Once the upset over the Columbia disaster settles down, NASA will release 
<br>
findings from the Microwave Anisotropy Probe that are sure to strengthen 
<br>
these findings even more.

<p>NOTE TO EDITORS: 03-011
<br>
<p>MICROWAVE ANISOTROPY MISSION FEATURED AT SPACE SCIENCE UPDATE
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most eagerly anticipated cosmological
<br>
findings in years is the topic of the next Space Science
<br>
Update (SSU), scheduled for 2:00 p.m. EST, Tuesday, Feb. 11.
<br>
The results are from NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP)
<br>
mission.
<br>
<p>The SSU is in the NASA Headquarters auditorium, 300 E St. SW,
<br>
Washington.
<br>
<p>Panelists:
<br>
*  Dr. Charles L. Bennett, principal investigator for MAP,
<br>
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.
<br>
*  Dr. David Spergel, co-investigator for MAP, Princeton
<br>
University, N.J.
<br>
*  Dr. John Bahcall, professor of natural sciences, Institute
<br>
for Advanced Study, Princeton, N.J.
<br>
*  Dr. Anne Kinney, director of astronomy &amp; physics division,
<br>
NASA Headquarters; panel moderator
<br>
<p>The briefing will be carried live on NASA Television with
<br>
two-way question-and-answer capability for reporters covering
<br>
the event from participating NASA centers.
<br>
<p>NASA TV is broadcast on the GE-2 satellite, Transponder 9C,
<br>
at 85 degrees west longitude, with vertical polarization,
<br>
frequency 3880.0 MHz, audio 6.8 MHz. Audio of the broadcast
<br>
will be available on voice circuit at NASA's Kennedy Space
<br>
Center, Fla., by calling 407/867-1220/1240/1260.

<br>
<p>------------------
<br>
<p>The initial results have finally been released. They mostly confirm what we 
<br>
know or thought to be the case. The Big Bang is yet even more strongly 
<br>
confirmed than before. I expect to see more detailed information about the 
<br>
results in a few days or so. (The instrument has been renamed and is now 
<br>
called WMAP in honor of Dr. David Wilkinson, a Princeton University 
<br>
cosmologist and leader of the MAP project who died last September.)
<br>
&nbsp;From <a href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/mr_limits.html">http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/mr_limits.html</a>
<br>
<p>We use our new detailed picture to ask: &quot;What happened earlier to make this 
<br>
picture happen?&quot; We now begin to probe the earliest moments of the 
<br>
universe: Inflation (the rapid expansion of the universe a fraction of a 
<br>
second after its birth.). We have ruled out a textbook example of a 
<br>
particular inflation model. But others will be supported with this new 
<br>
evidence.
<br>
<p>Starting from the time of our picture we can ask: &quot;What must have happened 
<br>
later?&quot;
<br>
We have compared and combined the new WMAP data with other diverse cosmic 
<br>
measurements (galaxy clustering, Lyman-alpha cloud clustering, supernovae, 
<br>
etc.), and we have found a new unified understanding of universe:
<br>
<p>Universe is 13.7 billion years old with a only a 1% margin error.
<br>
<p>First stars ignited 200 million years after the Big Bang.
<br>
<p>Light in WMAP picture from 380,000 years after the Big Bang.
<br>
<p>Content of the Universe:
<br>
4% Atoms, 23% Cold Dark Matter, 73% Dark energy.
<br>
<p>The data places new constraints on the dark energy. It seems more like a 
<br>
&quot;cosmological constant&quot; than a negative-pressure energy field called 
<br>
&quot;quintessence&quot;. But quintessence is not ruled out.
<br>
Fast moving neutrinos do not play any major role in the evolution of 
<br>
structure in the universe. They would have prevented the early clumping of 
<br>
gas in the universe, delaying the emergence of the first stars, in conflict 
<br>
with the new WMAP data.
<br>
<p>Expansion rate (Hubble constant) value: Ho= 71 km/sec/Mpc (with a margin of 
<br>
error of about 5%)
<br>
<p>New evidence for Inflation (in polarized signal)
<br>
<p>Fate of the Universe: it will expand forever...
