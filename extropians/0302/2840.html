<em>&gt; What kills me is that we are making &quot;these times&quot; much scarier 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times than they are or need to be.  We take one or a handfull of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual terrorist incidents and blow them up to terrorist hiding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behind every woodpile!  We take these few incidents and start 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living our lifes out of deep Fear and in reaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our dreams, our lives, our hopes cannot be served by such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction.  It is not news in the least that information and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge can be used for bad purposes as well as for good.  We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't stop living, working, sharing, communicating just because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone somehwere might do something terrible with what we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute.  That way is the way of death.  That way is the way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the terrorists would have us walk. If we go that way then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the terrorists win.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not in at all afraid of terrorism.  I am afraid of the deep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and needless fear that threatens to crush our hopes and dreams 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the very moment of their birth.
</em><br>

<p>I was thinking something like this as I watched the towers fall. I also
<br>
remember thinking &quot;shit, now the US is going to tear the world a new
<br>
arsehole&quot;.
<br>
<p>I really really wish I was wrong.
