<br>
would encourage such a society to come into existence.  Now, so far we've 
<br>
spent around $15 Billion on the war in Afghanistan, and continue to spend 
<br>
around $1.8 Billion a month there on military deployment.  By contrast, we've 
<br>
spent between $200 and $300 million on reconstruction and peace keeping.  To 
<br>
me this seems quite short sighted.  It focuses resources on the immediate 
<br>
crisis without investing in preventing the next crisis.
<br>
<p>Mez,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those may be good accounting numbers but I doubt we have spent 
<br>
anywhere near that amount of money.  The soldiers were getting fed and 
<br>
drawing a check anyway.  If they were not in Afghanistan they would be out on 
<br>
training exercises burning gasoline, shooting off ammo &amp; bombs, wreaking 
<br>
vehicles and airplanes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the amount of money we have spent on reconstruction and peace 
<br>
keeping.  As the UN is taking care of peacekeeping ideally the US wouldn't be 
<br>
spending anything.  That leaves reconstruction and if your number is correct 
<br>
then I have to feel that number would really get fuzzy.  For example we know 
<br>
from reading that the military has spent a lot feeding people, delivering 
<br>
food, building roads, bridges and rehabilitating runways.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end the Afghanistanis with have to do it themselves.  It is 
<br>
there country, that oil pipeline that is supposed to be worth trillions 
<br>
should provide them some capabillity to do their own reconstruction.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides wouldn't you be the first to criticise if the US went in there 
<br>
rebuilding the country in our image?
