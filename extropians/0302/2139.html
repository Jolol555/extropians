From: Kai Becker [mailto:<a href="mailto:kmb@kai-m-becker.de?Subject=RE:%20Hazards%20of%20Coal%20Burning%20was%20RE:%20Hydrogen%20as%20SCAM?">kmb@kai-m-becker.de</a>] 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not a loony, simply a knowledgeable, concerned person who lives a whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot closer to Chernobyl than I do..
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The effects of Chernobyl where significantly, even though we are &gt;1500km
<br>
away. I've found a quote that describes the most important effects: &quot;A large
<br>
amount of agricultural produce in Europe had to be dumped due to
<br>
contamination from fallout. For instance, most vegetables in the region
<br>
around Munich were destroyed because they had become contaminated with
<br>
iodine-131. The southern portion of the former West Germany was more
<br>
contaminated than the rest of it. There were also severe restrictions on
<br>
agricultural activities, including sales of meat from three million sheep
<br>
and lambs in northwestern England and the neighboring portions of Scotland
<br>
and northern Wales, which were affected by rain-out of radioactivity when
<br>
the fallout cloud passed over them.&quot;[2]&quot;
<br>
<p>I am still not seeing how this is worse than the 3 million people who are
<br>
dying every year, right now.  Do you feel that this number is perhaps
<br>
inaccurate?  You lost some veggies and some lambs, while 3 million people
<br>
every year lose there lives.  Or is it perhaps that I now grace your kill
<br>
file as well?  I just have difficulty understanding how you justify the
<br>
continued use of fossil fuel combustion, which you admittedly dislike, but
<br>
there are no alternatives currently available that *wont* kill 3 million
<br>
every year except for nuclear power. Do we keep waiting for an alternative,
<br>
while millions die every year?  Do we reduce the global energy demand to
<br>
substinence agriculture levels so we wont need nuclear or fossil fuel power?
<br>
Not a world I would want to live in nor one that would be conducive to
<br>
bringing about the singularity.  
<br>
<p>&quot;If we would have just one accident like that in western Europe, we could
<br>
only shut down everything and look for another place to live.&quot;
<br>
<p>So, if a Chernobyl like accident occurred in a Chernobyl like plant in
<br>
western europe devastation would occur.  Solution, A) don't build chernobyl
<br>
like plants and B) don't build them in western europe
<br>
<p>Citing chernobyl as an example of unsafe nuclear reactors is like citing the
<br>
titanic as a reason to think cruiseliners are unsafe.  You are blaiming
<br>
nuclear reactors for an accident that cost dozens of short term deaths,
<br>
hundreds of cases of cancer and thousand or premature deaths, and some bad
<br>
crops and lambs, instead of the corrupt murderous government that built,
<br>
operated, and maintained said facility.  A facility which would have never
<br>
been built in any other nation.  Chernobyl had no actual containment
<br>
structure (as opposed to three unique independent ones most western reactors
<br>
have) to prevent release of contamination. Such a design could not be
<br>
licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in this country, nor in most
<br>
countries of the world.  Had a chernobyl like accident occurred in a western
<br>
reactor it would have been contained, but would have no chance of occuring
<br>
in the first palce anyway.  If there is anyone to blame for the horrors of
<br>
Chernobyl, it's the soviet government (which had allready killed some 10
<br>
million of its own people) NOT nuclear reactors.  I am sure the Soviet Union
<br>
killed many more in its thousands if not millions of faulty state products,
<br>
wars, and famines.  Do you blame those products for those deaths, or the
<br>
government that sanctioned them and forced them on their people?  
<br>
<p>Does my making a beach ball that randomly explodes make all beach balls
<br>
unsafe?  Or just the beach balls that have hand grenades inside them?
<br>
<p>I understand how your close proximity to this event could give you a
<br>
particular point of view on it.  But again, what about the 3 million people
<br>
who are dying every year right now?  What if they lived right next door to
<br>
you?  What if these 3 million people were everyone you knew, and everyone
<br>
they knew?  Will their families feel consoled by your concern about the
<br>
vegatables being destroyed in Munich?

<p>The Chernobyl Reactor: Design Features and Reasons for Accident
<br>
<p>From - <a href="http://www-j.rri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/NSRG/reports/kr79/kr79pdf/Malko1.pdf">http://www-j.rri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/NSRG/reports/kr79/kr79pdf/Malko1.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;According to the Soviet experts the prime cause of the accident at the
<br>
Chernobyl NPP was &quot;...an extremely improbable combination of violations of
<br>
instructions and operating rules committed by the staff of the unit&quot; [3].
<br>
This conclusion sets a full responsibility for the accident at the Chernobyl
<br>
NPP on its stuff. Participants of the Post-Accident Review Meeting [2] also
<br>
accepted the Soviet version. However, it was incorrect. This was
<br>
demonstrated in 1990 by the commission of the State Committee for Atomic
<br>
Safety Survey of the USSR which concluded that the main reasons of the
<br>
Chernobyl accident were serious shortcomings in the design of the Chernobyl
<br>
reactor as well as inadequate documents regulating a safe operation of the
<br>
reactor [4].
<br>
<p>&quot;Conclusions - The main reasons of the accident at the Chernobyl NPP were
<br>
sever shortages of the design, severe infringements of the safety
<br>
regulations for construction of the reactor as well as low safety culture in
<br>
the USSR preceding the accident.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fear's just bad for business
<br>
Interesting commentary from -
<br>
<a href="http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/humanity/fear.html">http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/humanity/fear.html</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;There was a difference in attitude that went into the design of ChernobylD
<br>
compared to Three Mile IslandD, and its roots could be found in the social
<br>
ethic of each government in power at the time. One believed that profit was
<br>
not important to motivate workers, while the other believed that profit was
<br>
everything. As a result, one built a reactor with the cheapest design to
<br>
save money, while the other spent a fortune and vastly overengineered. Guess
<br>
which side built the cheap one? Yep, the Soviets. Not just because they
<br>
wanted to save money, but because while they were busy dismissing profit as
<br>
a motivator they also missed the importance of eliminating fear as a
<br>
distraction.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It's the impact of fear and worry on the locals which the Soviets
<br>
disregarded, but the Americans held almost holy, and thus the big difference
<br>
between Chernobyl and TMI. Chernobyl was based on a design that had a
<br>
positive void coefficientD, which meant it was unstable at low power. The
<br>
accident happened because the power level of the reactor fell unexpectedly,
<br>
and the operator tried to compensate by removing the control rods and
<br>
raising the power back to safe levels, only it got out of control.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Three Mile Island, by comparison, was a story of poorly informed operators
<br>
thwarting a heavily overdesigned system that was doing its best to safely
<br>
shut down the reactor automatically. In both accidents there was an
<br>
explosion of hydrogen. At Chernobyl it blew the cap off the reactor core and
<br>
exposed hot graphite to oxygen, making it catch on fire. At Three Mile
<br>
Island the explosion was completely contained, in fact it didn't even cause
<br>
any undue stress to the containment building, which had 12-foot thick steel
<br>
reinforecd walls. Chernobyl had no such containment building, only a
<br>
concrete &quot;bio shield&quot;.&quot;
