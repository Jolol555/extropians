In the debate about the Fermi paradox Dennis May has
<br>
written (as supplied by Dan)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; it's not that advanced ETIs would be afraid of humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as they are now, but of giving themselves away to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other advanced ETIs that might see them as threats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or rivals, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you give yourself away to humans there is some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance you are giving yourself away to many other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups as well.  An advanced group might be aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that humans are a single breakthrough away from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regular space travel and WoMD which cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guarded against.
</em><br>
<p>I consider all this quite silly.  Civilizations that
<br>
reach approximately our level of achievement, which
<br>
takes merely a million years from the animal state,
<br>
quickly undergo some sort of singularity and expand
<br>
to encompass all solar systems in their galaxy.  This
<br>
requires far less than one additional million years.
<br>
So all told, we are talking about it taking less than
<br>
two million years for an animal to conquer a galaxy.
<br>
<p>These arguments are bolstered to a rather definitive
<br>
degree IMO in Frank Tipler's &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;
<br>
and Barrow and Tipler's &quot;The Cosmic Anthropological
<br>
Principle&quot;.  He points out that using &quot;Von Neumann probes&quot;
<br>
a civilization converts the remaining part of its galaxy
<br>
to its own tissue (my words) in a geological eye-blink.
<br>
<p>The civilization, of course, continues to expand at the
<br>
speed of light, with at every moment the singularity at
<br>
the center retaining the most advanced state.
<br>
<p>Talk about &quot;advanced ETI's&quot; somehow remaining aloof 
<br>
from our planet is merely emotionally appealing SF.
<br>
&quot;There aren't any&quot;; that's the answer to the Fermi
<br>
question.
