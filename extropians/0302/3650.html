Spike,
<br>
<p>Thanks for the reply. 
<br>
One very unfortunate thing is that I live in downtown San Francisco! I
<br>
love living here too. It really is a unique wonderful place. When I go
<br>
many other places, I enjoy the nature, but as Dorothy said there just
<br>
ainn't no place like home. SF brings _together_ many people who think
<br>
like I do. Sure I can find them on the Internet, but in the boonies
<br>
&quot;thars alotta rednecks&quot; 
<br>
<p>:-)
<br>
Erik

<p>Welcome aboard Erik.  {8-]
<br>
<p>Regarding that Nova Tuesday night, I am sure a lot
<br>
of law enforcement agencies were groaning.  But another organization
<br>
that must be beside themselves is the green movement.  It is becoming
<br>
ever clearer to me that our cities have become too tempting a target for
<br>
terrorists and extremists, and that soon humans will scatter.  The
<br>
earth-firsters must really hate terrorists.
<br>
<p>The internet has come along just in time, for we
<br>
can get most of what the city has to offer, without
<br>
actually having to live in one.  We can develop
<br>
software as a team without the participants ever
<br>
having to meet in the flesh.  Partially evacuating
<br>
the cities need not slow our march toward the
<br>
singularity.  In the long run, many may actually
<br>
enjoy better living conditions if we scatter like
<br>
dust in the wind.
<br>
<p>The wildlife will not fare so well.  But I suppose
<br>
terrorists and extremists do not take that into
<br>
consideration.
