Ron h says:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seriously, this country was hit first by the Al Qaeda.  Now it sees a man
</em><br>
that has hit them
<br>
<em>&gt; personally in the past, as well as others, looking for the weapons to hit
</em><br>
them
<br>
<em>&gt; again.  So they have decided to hit him first.  Is that so illogical?
</em><br>
<p>Let's start by trying to sort out the syntax. I'm guessing that Ron meant
<br>
this:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seriously, this country was hit first by the Al Qaeda.  Now it sees a man,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well as others, that has hit it personally in the past, looking for the
</em><br>
weapons
<br>
<em>&gt; to hit it again.  So it has decided to hit him first.  Is that so
</em><br>
illogical?
<br>
<p>The logic appears to be: We Americans were hit recently by a bad man, and
<br>
earlier by another bad man. Now we see the second bad man and other bad men
<br>
preparing to hit us again. So we're gonna cream his ass first. The second
<br>
bad man. You know. Then the other bad men. Especially the first bad man,
<br>
that is, the most recent bad man, if we can ever find him.
<br>
<p>One problem with this analysis is that there could be an equal and opposite
<br>
analysis also in play:
<br>
<p>..............
<br>
<p>Seriously, this country Iraq was hit first by the USA and its UN allies. Now
<br>
it sees a man
<br>
whose father has hit it personally in the past, bringing forth the weapons
<br>
to hit it again.  So it has decided to hit his nation first.  Is that so
<br>
illogical?
<br>
<p>..............
<br>
<p>[note for the slow of reading: this is not *my* personal view; it is my
<br>
guess at the view of the bad man]
<br>
<p>Luckily, the second version might not actually *be* in play. The bad man
<br>
might be too concerned for his own skin. We don't know that Saddam employs
<br>
the interesting strategic approach suggested by Ron h. So perhaps, even when
<br>
threatened by more than the weekly fly-overs and bombings, he might *not*
<br>
decide to sneak terrible weapons into the USA or other UN foes and act as
<br>
the other bad man did. Let's hope so.
<br>
<p>(*What* terrible weapons? I'm sorry, I can't answer that, and apparently
<br>
nobody else can either. But you never know.)
