<p><em>&gt; Part of this is just that NASA is run politically.  The Shuttle program,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>You don't throw away a 747 everytime you fly it.  The very fact that it
<br>
costs so much to maintain is, itself, causing the problem, and as such
<br>
the economics become an engineering concern just like if the main engine
<br>
sometimes refused to light.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;One of the mission specialists was a personal

<em>&gt;&gt;Angry that NASA's mismanagement of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not so sure, but I tend to side with you here.  We have to get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts in first to see what happened and why before judging this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular tragedy.
</em><br>
<p><p>Based on my own knowledge of NASA, its procedures and its history, I
<br>
feel safe in predicting that this was caused by a technical malfunction,
<br>
probably age-related, that either did not exist or did not present any
<br>
significant danger of causing problems in flight on any of the space
<br>
shuttles a decade ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, I posted this on Starship Forum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Starship_Forum/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Starship_Forum/</a> ) earlier this week.  I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>The first two - Rolls-Royce plus Oil Change - are what myself and some
<br>
of my acquaintances are already working on, for Earth-to-orbit vehicles.
<br>
(And, let's face it: this side of Moon or Mars colonization, practically
<br>
every space mission is going to have to use an Earth-to-orbit vehicle,
<br>
which means problems with such vehicles impact *all* human activity in
<br>
space.  If you could, for the same cost, double performance of deep
<br>
space or Earth-to-orbit engines, you could do the latter and just launch
<br>
more reaction mass for the same cost for the inefficient deep space
<br>
engines, while reaping other benefits that will eventually pay for
<br>
doubling the deep space engines too.)
