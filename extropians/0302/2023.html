-----Original Message----

From: <a href="mailto:humania@t-online.de?Subject=RE:%20Time.com%20asks%20you%20to%20vote%20for%20most%20dangerous%20country">humania@t-online.de</a>
<br>
<p>Humania, I am sure you are an intelligent compasionate and interesting
<br>
person, so I am confused about your statements in this message, which to me
<br>
seem morally repugnant, corrupt, intellectual dishonest, counterproductive,
<br>
and anti-extropian to the extreme.  
<br>
<p>You said 
<br>
<p>&quot;Call me what you will or think of me what you will. I will not engage in
<br>
mind games about better or worse superpowers anymore. I am sick of being in
<br>
the position where I must justify my peace loving attitude. This is
<br>
absolutely ridiculous.&quot;
<br>
<p>When peace loving attitudes of the past have lead to the worse mass murders
<br>
in humanities history, you can rightly expect those of us with knowledge of
<br>
these historical events to challenge your attitude that 'peace loving' is
<br>
automatically a moral high ground.  I love peace as much as you I am sure,
<br>
despite what you may think, which is why I want to see it for all people,
<br>
even the people in Iraq, and north korea, and Iran, and china, and and and
<br>
and...  Your attitudes sentence the people who were born in areas not as
<br>
political free as yours to lives of oppression, murder, and slavery.  That
<br>
is NOT peace.  That is NOT extropian.  That is NOT transhuman. 
<br>
<p>&quot;All of you, who are so war horny today, YOU (plural) are the ones who
<br>
should ask yourselves if you still have anything to do with transhumanism. &quot;
<br>
<p>And you should ask yourself that as well, as you sit idly by while millions
<br>
live in oppression and murder.  Not only do you sit idly by, you oppose
<br>
efforts to eliminate it.  Is that transhuman?  Are efforts to stop such
<br>
travesty also against the promotion and well being of humanity, technology,
<br>
and progress?  Considering these regimese endorse the exact opposite of all
<br>
those, and kill thousands or millions in the process, I find it difficult to
<br>
understand the justification for your stance.
<br>
<p>&quot;No power has the right to attack a country even if a monster of a dictator
<br>
rules there. The US/UK junta is going to ignite a world fire pretty soon and
<br>
the supporters of war among you know it.&quot;
<br>
<p>This has got to be one of the most ridiculous things I have read as yet.
<br>
You are essentially endorsing the existence of murderous governments,
<br>
inaction is morally no different then support.  It is attitudes like yours
<br>
that forbade the US from involving itself in the Cambodian holocaust, where
<br>
ultimately more than 2 million people were killed.  A monstrous dictator has
<br>
no right to be a dictator, and his country has no right to exist under his
<br>
rule.  Your moral concepts are strange and internally inconsistent, they
<br>
seem to only be comprised of 'lets just all get along!!!!'  It would be nice
<br>
if we all did, but some people out there prefer to murder and oppress than
<br>
to get along, and fighting them is a moral cause.  I find you absolute black
<br>
and white rule of &quot;No power has the right to attack a country even if..&quot;
<br>
absurd, new agey, and not grounded in any reality I know of, except one that
<br>
endorses that lack of one.
<br>
<p>&quot;Love, Peace, Over And Out&quot;
<br>
<p>No one is free unless everyone is free.  
<br>
