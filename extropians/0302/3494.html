<p>*Newton suspected world was going to end in 2060*
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/search/site/story.asp">http://www.nationalpost.com/search/site/story.asp</a>?

<br>
<p>A Canadian researcher has unearthed a handwritten manuscript revealing Sir
<br>
Isaac Newton predicted the world will end in the year 2060.
<br>
<p>After more than 55 years of trying to decode the Bible, Newton concluded
<br>
that Armageddon -- a last great battle of global repercussions with plagues,
<br>
war, return of Christ, end of time -- would occur more than 300 years after
<br>
his death, in 1727. He said it would be followed by a 1,000-year reign by
<br>
the saints on Earth.
<br>
<p>The manuscript was found by Stephen Snobelen, assistant professor in the
<br>
history of science and technology programme at University of King's College
<br>
in Halifax.
<br>
<p>The discovery will be featured in a BBC documentary airing in Britain and
<br>
Israel on Saturday. Newton: The Dark Heretic is not scheduled to be
<br>
broadcast in North America until next year.
<br>
<p>Newton won immortality for formulating the law of gravity, but he was also a
<br>
theologian who wrote well over a million words on biblical subjects and was
<br>
influenced by Hebrew scripture, according to academic articles on his work.
<br>
<p>Newton's selection of a date is considered significant because he rarely
<br>
pinpointed important time frames. &quot;Newton argued that this brought discredit
<br>
to Christianity and the Bible and so he said you shouldn't set dates,&quot; Mr.
<br>
Snobelen said yesterday. &quot;So the fact that he actually seems to have caved
<br>
into the temptation of setting dates itself is spectacular and rather
<br>
stunning.
<br>
<p>&quot;He was a scholar who in many respects was very cautious.... He was not
<br>
running around the streets telling people the sky is falling or anything
<br>
like that,&quot; he added.
<br>
<p>In Newton's own words, likely written near the end of his life, he stated:
<br>
&quot;This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put
<br>
a stop to the rash conjectures of fancifull men who are frequently
<br>
predicting the time of the end, &amp; by doing so bring the sacred prophesies
<br>
into discredit as often as their predictions fail.&quot;
<br>
<p>Many consider Newton the most influential scientist who ever lived. His
<br>
accomplishments in mathematics, physics and optics laid the foundation for
<br>
modern science and, in turn, revolutionized the world.
<br>
<p>Newton (1642-1727) studied the Bible for most of his life, trying to unravel
<br>
what he believed were God's secret laws of the universe. He was trying to
<br>
determine the code to unlock secrets of the New Testament's Book of
<br>
Revelation: when Armageddon will occur, along with the second coming of
<br>
Christ, Jews returning to Israel and the rebuilding of the Temple.
<br>
<p>He noted a number of time periods are listed in the Book of Daniel from the
<br>
Old Testament. One of these is 1,260 days, which Newton interpreted as 1,260
<br>
years, based on a day-per-year principle. The time frame is one in which
<br>
Newton interpreted to stand for a period when the church (Orthodox, Roman
<br>
Catholic and Anglican) would be mired in deep corruption.
<br>
<p>In his attempt to decode the mind of God, Newton determined that 1260 date
<br>
actually began in 800 AD, a time when the Roman Catholic church was given
<br>
political power over countries. He then added 1260 to 800 to arrive at the
<br>
date of 2060 for the Apocalypse. It is mentioned twice in his manuscripts.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think a lot of people are going to read the 2060 date with some interest
<br>
because Newton is very respected,&quot; Mr. Snobelen said. &quot;There may be a sense
<br>
that he got the science right, maybe he got the prophesy right, too.
<br>
<p>&quot;It represents a lifetime, something like 55 to 60 years, of scouring the
<br>
Book of Revelation and trying to determine what God was telling mankind
<br>
about the future.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thousands of Newton's theological papers, which remained in a trunk in the
<br>
house of the Earl of Portsmouth for 250 years, were sold by Sotheby's in the
<br>
late 1930s.
<br>
<p>John Maynard Keynes, the economist, bought many and when he died he donated
<br>
the manuscripts to his alma mater, King's College, Cambridge.
<br>
<p>Much of the remaining material went to Abraham Yahuda. Stored at the Jewish
<br>
National Library in Jerusalem, it is the largest collection of Newton's
<br>
works, some 4,500 pages with very small handwriting and some scribbling. It
<br>
is among these documents that the date was found. Mr. Snobelen made the
<br>
discovery several years ago but the issue never became public.
