<p>Well, yes, all taxes are bad. Shall we have a vote on that?? ;-)
<br>
But sometimes no taxes are worse.
<br>
<p>The USA has 42,000 (and rising) traffic deaths per year. That is quite a
<br>
bit of damage to the economy, and to all the families involved.  This
<br>
continuing increase in death goes along in line with the increased usage
<br>
of large cars like SUVs. Why????????
<br>
The large size of the cars is *not* stopping the death toll on American
<br>
roads.
<br>
<p>It is very cynical to just shrug and say &quot;Well, people are free to kill
<br>
themselves if they want to.&quot; Over half of these deaths are just
<br>
bystanders who were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
<br>
People who cause accidents don't just kill themselves.
<br>
<p>To quote Leonard Evans again:
<br>
'U.S. traffic policy since the 1970s has been dominated by the delusion
<br>
that safety can be achieved by changing vehicles to increase
<br>
survivability in crashes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As measured by traffic deaths per million registered vehicles, the
<br>
U.S. was the safest nation in the world in the early 1970s. Today it is
<br>
in 13th place, and still dropping. Better-performing countries have not
<br>
done anything that is either extraordinary or draconian -- they have
<br>
simply not fallen into the obsessive focus on marginal factors such as
<br>
tires, vehicle defects and airbags that dominate U.S. safety policy.'
<br>
<p><p>By being dependent on excessive oil consumption, the USA is handing over
<br>
billions of dollars to the oil-producing countries and generating huge
<br>
amounts of wealth in those countries. These countries may well not have
<br>
the best interests of the USA at heart when spending those billions of
<br>
dollars (irony alert!). 
<br>
This is a national security issue, not just saving a few dollars on 
<br>
your travel costs.
