<p><em>&gt; ### I have been thinking about this issue for a long time. It sounds very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractive, to have private, competing highway systems. One thing bugs me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however - the acquisition of the land for roads would be quite difficult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You couldn't use eminent domain (or could you?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip....a lot of stuff regarding land theft (hostile buy out...what a nice 
<br>
term)&gt;
<br>
<p>The idea of private highways has merit.  They even exist.  The last time I 
<br>
was in Maine I was informed that Maine's toll road was privately owned.
<br>
<p>However...lets examine an alternative.  Two alternatives. ...to stealing 
<br>
land.
<br>
<p>One...elevate the highways.  There are already EXTREMELY long bridges thru 
<br>
out the world....I know of one over a swamp (excuse me....and enviromentally 
<br>
sensitive wet land............a swamp)  in Louisana ........about 20 miles 
<br>
long.
<br>
<p>In such a case there would be minimal impact on the existing land use 
<br>
....similar to wind farms....each tower takes up about 50 x 50 foot of 
<br>
land......such might be the case of the supporting towers for the elevated 
<br>
roadway.
<br>
<p>Secondly...tunnels. The Eiesenhower tunnel on I-70 west of Denver is several 
<br>
miles long.  It's several decades old....I would guess the tunneling 
<br>
techniques have improved. I dunno anything about tunnels but it would seem 
<br>
that they don't interfer with surface use of the land.
