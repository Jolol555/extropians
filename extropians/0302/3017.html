<em>&gt; Is it really?  I know we did participate in the rise of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shah to some extent.  But are you underestimating the deep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire of Moslems for a state that is ruled by Moslem law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know some pretty moderate Moslems that deeply and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sincerely believe that Moslem law is superior to secular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule.  
</em><br>
<p>FYI, I was born in Egypt and still visit there from time to time.  I'm
<br>
an atheist and I'm happy to be an American, but I believe my
<br>
upbringing and family give me a bit more insight into the middle
<br>
eastern mindset than most people.
<br>
<p>As far as I can tell, most people around the world want the same
<br>
thing.  They want a happy, comfortable life.  They want safety and at
<br>
least a little bit of freedom.  They want opportunities for themselves
<br>
and their kids.
<br>
<p>My belief is that fanaticism and hatred are inversely correlated to
<br>
freedom and opportunity.  If you take away all the hope that someone
<br>
has for a better future, then you leave that person much more willing
<br>
to engage in destructive behavior.
<br>
<p>In the middle east today there's very little hope.  Most arabs are
<br>
extremely poor.  Even in rich countries like Saudi Arabia or Qatar,
<br>
only a tiny minority reap the benefits of the oil wealth.  The rest
<br>
live in poverty with no way out.  They look at their governments and
<br>
they see corrupt dictators who steal from the country.  They look
<br>
again and see that their governments are supported by the US.
<br>
<p>This feeling of hopelessness and oppression gives rise to fanaticism
<br>
and violence.  When you're desperately poor and uneducated, the idea
<br>
of a vengeful god who will send you to paradise if you kill his
<br>
enemies is awfully appealing.  It's even better when his enemies are
<br>
the people who have what you want (comfort and affluence) and are also
<br>
the ones who are directly or indirectly oppressing you.
<br>
<p>That's why I believe that the best thing the US could do to reduce
<br>
terrorism in the long run is to help uplift these awful parts of the
<br>
world.  Last year the US spent more than $400 Billion on defense and
<br>
national security and only $10 Billion on foreign aid.  To me that
<br>
looks very shortsighted.  We should be paying dictators to allow a
<br>
free press in their country.  We should be building schools and
<br>
training teachers.  We should be paying the poor of impoverished
<br>
countries to build infrastructure in those places, just as we did in
<br>
the US during the great depression.
<br>
<p>Those are the steps that will reduce global poverty, hopelessness, and
<br>
fanaticism.
