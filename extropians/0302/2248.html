</em><br>
<p>When I read Tipler, I remember I was wondering why on earth he wanted to
<br>
haul back every person who had EVER lived back into life again. From that
<br>
moment on I thought he must be completely nuts. I guess, it's fine to
<br>
*think* about the possibility of doing it in order to make clear how much
<br>
power would be on our hand, once we would slide and shiver into Omega Point.
<br>
<p>But then, am I really that naive or would that mean I had to sign up for
<br>
taking - let's say - half a dozen resurrected mongolian warriors who died in
<br>
a tribal skirmish with Western Siberians some 30.000 years ago into my
<br>
apartment and explain them the use of the TV remote control, get enough
<br>
mammoth meat for them to eat and help them getting along with the
<br>
application form for social security?
<br>
<p>I mean what great effort would it mean to provide a job for all the humans
<br>
who had ever lived? What would you do with Stalin, Hitler and Pol Pot?
<br>
Gently brain wash them with a love-peace-and-happiness neuro linguistic
<br>
program? Well, this might be a fine retraining course for the six mongolian
<br>
warriors in my apartment. NLP trainers who spread the Kantian/Extropian
<br>
message amongst their war loving contemporaries. Think about some animal
<br>
right fighters who make it to the Omega Point! Would they stand up for
<br>
resurrecting all primates who had ever lived? Dolphins? This might get
<br>
pretty crowed down here. Another fine reason for exploring space and
<br>
supporting NASA.
<br>
<p>Cheers
