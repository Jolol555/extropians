</em><br>
<p>Yes, and not only good lawyers are &quot;good with words&quot;.
<br>
<p>Some people might read the above two usages of the phrase
<br>
&quot;moderately strong&quot; and conclude that John Clarke thinks two
<br>
moderately strong cases are necessarily of equal merit. But &quot;moderately
<br>
strong&quot; is not a discrete quantity and discrete quantities of similar
<br>
strength
<br>
can be clustered under the term &quot;moderately strong&quot; and made to sound
<br>
like equalities. A person good at spin might create such a misimpression
<br>
of equality and retain their actual opinion undisclosed ;-)
<br>
<p>Do you think it is uncertain who is authorised to decide under 1441
<br>
that &quot;the final opportunity&quot; is over?
<br>
<p>I think it's clear that the Security Council gets to decide. I think
<br>
that 1441 is sufficiently clear and that anyone who reads it can make
<br>
the determination on this point for themselves.
<br>
<p>Interestingly, from all the possible points that the US might have
<br>
proffered for re-endorsed it was the clause on &quot;the final opportunity&quot;
<br>
that was selected and included in the draft resolution.
<br>
<p>For a supposedly redundant Security Council decision why was that
<br>
particular clause singled out?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually I think the UN needs that second resolution more than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; USA does because like it or not one way or another this war will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  happen.
</em><br>
<p>The United Nations is a club of nations that have agreed with each
<br>
other and they preserved their obligations in the UN Charter. In the
<br>
event of a single nation breaking this covenant unilaterally how does
<br>
one weigh up who is harmed more?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If the UN becomes known as a organization that passes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolutions but does not enforce them it will become irrelevant and go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the way of the old League Of Nations.
</em><br>
<p>Very true.
<br>
<p>But, if the UN fails what of the USA's citizens amidst other nations
<br>
citizens, and what of the confidence these citizens have in their
<br>
governments obligations to them? Where does the Bush
<br>
administration stop revoking obligations for expedience as it alone
<br>
sees it?
