<br>
<em>&gt; It appears that my personal home PC has been hacked.
</em><br>
<p>Doubtful.  But, I'll suspend disbelief for a moment ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Someone unbeknownst to me has discovered the password and email
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address that I once used to logon to a particular website. [...] I use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty much the same email and password for everything, [...]
</em><br>
<p>Is the email address you use common enough knowledge?  It probably is --
<br>
so, the only challenge is getting your password.  It probably wasn't
<br>
longer than 8 characters, was it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; though I have already rushed to change the most critical passwords in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wake of this incident. 
</em><br>
<p>Good move.  In general, change your passwords often -- at least once
<br>
every 3 months to be safe, I'd say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This person then impersonated me on the relevant site and used the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting record of my activity in an effort to disrupt my personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life in a very destructive way.
</em><br>
<p>That sucks.  No matter what, that's a real drag.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have no evidence so far that this person is not also seeking to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disrupt my financial or professional life.
</em><br>
<p>Count your blessings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My PC is generally not physically accessible to anyone other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself.
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean by &quot;generally&quot;?  How often is your PC physically
<br>
accessible to someone else?  Once a week?  Once a month?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [...] but in this case there is every reason to believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culprit was no stranger. The primary suspect in my mind is one of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handful spiteful and potentially treacherous ex-girlfriends [...]
</em><br>
<p>Presumably, these ex-girlfriends had to have had physical access to you
<br>
and your PC at some point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My first guess therefore is that my security was compromised by some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of remote installation stealth keylogging software capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gathering my password information and transmitting back to the sender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the internet.  It's my understanding that it is possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; install keylogging and screenshot copying software remotely via email
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attachments, attachments which would then, if executed, start sending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data secretly to the original sender via unseen email.
</em><br>
<p>Occam's Razor would say your little conspiracy theory is a bit unlikely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; She might just as well know right now that I have every intention to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go after her ass with a vengeance. If possible I will press legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charges.)
</em><br>
<p>FYI, if she's clueful enough to 0wn you, chances are, your threats
<br>
aren't scaring her.  If you indeed are 0wned, any threats may just lead
<br>
to you getting more unpleasant things happening to you.  Not wise on
<br>
your part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am running Windows XP Home Edition. Until a couple of week ago I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connected 24/7 via DSL, but in the last few weeks I have been using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dialup only.
</em><br>
<p>h0 h0 h0!  Windows XP 0wned Edition connected 24/7 by DSL.  I bet you
<br>
probably didn't keep up with the latest security patches as they
<br>
immediately came out, did you?
<br>
<p>Did you know enough to rename your owner account?  And put a password on
<br>
it?
<br>
<p>Anyone running Windows XP (Home or Pro, but /especially/ XP Home) should
<br>
at least glance over this web page at least three times:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blackviper.com/WinXP/supertweaks.htm">http://www.blackviper.com/WinXP/supertweaks.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Specifically, number 12 which I'll quote here:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Note: If you have previously used the &quot;Owner&quot; or &quot;Administrator&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| account for &quot;general purpose&quot;, your account options could be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| affected if you rename the accounts. If anything, password them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| NOW!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Most, if not all, games and applications require you to have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| &quot;Administrator Privileges&quot; to install them.  Most, if not all,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| games require you to have &quot;Administrator Privileges&quot; to use them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Why should you do these things? Crackers need 2 things to access
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| your PC:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 1) A user name
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 2) A password.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| If you do not rename your Administrator account, 50% of their work
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| is done.  If you do not password your Administrator account, 100%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| of their work is done.  If you do not rename your &quot;Owner&quot; account,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 50% of their work is done.  If you do not password your &quot;Owner&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| account, 100% of their work is done.  This is only valid for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Windows XP Pro. For XP Home, skip down a few lines:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Disable the &quot;Guest&quot; account. Where? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Administrator Tools --&gt; Computer Management --&gt; Local Users and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Groups --&gt; User folder --&gt; Right click &quot;Guest&quot; and select
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| &quot;Properties&quot;. In the General Tab, check &quot;Account is Disabled&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Rename the &quot;Administrator&quot; account. Where?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Administrator Tools --&gt; Computer Management --&gt; Local Users and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Groups --&gt; User folder --&gt; Right click &quot;Administrator&quot; and select
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| &quot;Rename&quot;.  Do NOT disable this account. You may need it someday.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| This is only valid for Windows XP Home: Do this NOW!!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Everyone on XP Home, by default, has Administrator privileges and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| the User name is &quot;Owner&quot;. If I know that, so does everyone else on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| the planet. Change the name and / or password your account. If
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| anything, password it. NEVER have an account unprotected! EVER!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| How?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Start --&gt; Control Panel --&gt; User Accounts --&gt; Choose &quot;Owner&quot; --&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Select &quot;Change my name&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Also, you should (will) place a password on your account.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| How?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Start --&gt; Control Panel --&gt; User Accounts --&gt; Choose &quot;Owner&quot; (or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| what ever account you named it above) --&gt; Select &quot;Create a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| password&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In what other ways might someone gain access to my password and logon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information to impersonate me at a particular web site, short of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical access to my PC? Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.
</em><br>
<p>If I were a betting person, I'd bet you a nickel that you got socially
<br>
engineered or shoulder surfed, and not keylogged.
<br>
<p>Social engineering is likely: if the aggressor is an ex-girlfriend, she
<br>
may have learned enough about you to simply guess your password -- or,
<br>
ask you the right questions to learn the same.
<br>
<p>Shoulder surfing is likely: if the aggressor is an ex-girlfriend, she
<br>
was likely physically present when you logged in using your email
<br>
address and password and simply shoulder-surfed your password out of
<br>
curiousity.  Girlfriends like to know these weird little details about
<br>
their partners ... at least the geeky ones do.
<br>
<p>These last two, less likely possibilities, I wouldn't necessarily bet on
<br>
but I wouldn't rule out:
<br>
<p>The first possibility: You may have logged into your account from
<br>
another machine which might have been keylogged -- such as from a
<br>
friend's house, a public library machine, etc.  Do you ever log into
<br>
your account from a machine other than your own?  EVER?  I'm not talking
<br>
about &quot;not frequently&quot; -- all it takes is one time and for that one time
<br>
to be monitored and you're hosed.
<br>
<p>The second possibility: Are you using wireless LAN at all?  Even with
<br>
WEP (you know, Weak Encryption Protocol, ha ha ha!) you're not secure
<br>
unless you're using something real like IPSec as well.  If all you're
<br>
using is either clear wireless LAN or even wireless LAN with either 64-
<br>
or 128-bit WEP, anyone within range and the right software tools could
<br>
walk away with your network traffic which likely includes usernames and
<br>
passwords.  It's not hard for a geeky girlfriend who knows you're using
<br>
wireless LAN to sit in her car parked down the street from your house
<br>
and capture your network traffic and pick out your passwords later on.
<br>
<p>Think about it ...
