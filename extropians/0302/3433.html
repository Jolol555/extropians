Lee noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;A human brain could easily
<br>
run on a 1cc device, and no telling what could run
<br>
on a Jupiter brain.  But the Jupiter brain's program
<br>
(its algorithms) will hardly be optimal...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Lee, I am not disagreeing with you regarding this thread, or your opinion. 
<br>
What I am cynical about is the notion that all this level of technology, is 
<br>
approachable within 200 years. I am guessing (purely guessing) that the 
<br>
impact, the speed of technological application has been overstated; again its 
<br>
impact have been oversold. 
<br>
<p>Just look at the technological forecasts of the last 50 years, just look at 
<br>
the thousands of journalists who have taken a whack at it. The results have 
<br>
been too optimistic, in the extreme. We may be waiting quite a while for the 
<br>
Singularity, and in may be the seredipty of reseach that ignites SIAI, rather 
<br>
then ploding away with silicon. Now dna computing is another matter, and yet, 
<br>
it too sounds like the wonder stuff heralding the &quot;atomic age&quot; and its 
<br>
&quot;benefits.&quot;  Lets see if dna imitates life, and since &quot;humans&quot; are of 
<br>
human-level intelligence (occasionally) so perhaps someday Johnny-5 will 
<br>
arrive. Powered by bio-goo, just like me and you.
