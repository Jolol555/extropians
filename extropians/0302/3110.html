<em>&gt; &quot;ArchD'Ikon Zibethicus&quot; wrote, Mon Feb 17;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All those quotes regarding doubts about evolution got me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking -specifically, the quote which asserted that no species,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not even Drosophila, has even been observed changing into another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wouldn't it be possible, at least theoretically, to actually _test_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this empirically?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given Drosophila's rapid rate of mutation, could one not isolate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population and...I dunno...say repeatedly expose them to radiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or some other stress...heavily alkaline water supply,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something...then allow a few generations to survive and breed among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves. Then one attempts to breed them with an un-mutated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the mutant Drosophila couldn't interbreed with the control, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could interbreed with themselves, isn't that one of the determinants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of species status?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or am I missing something profoundly obvious here?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a perfectly logical and reasonable suggestion; and is in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly what those decades of &quot;failed&quot; experiments, producing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutants by using x-rays and other external what-nots, were all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about. As a consquence of all that scientific effort, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tautology &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; should have been replaced with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the much more accurate slogan &quot;rejection of the mutants&quot; as a proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foundation for naturalism. But that would have totally undermined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the evolutionary principle, and spoilt the whole established social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order; which is running along very profitably without those sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disruptive heresies, thank you very much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What wasn't understood until quite recently, but is now throughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; established, is that every organism, without exception, is totally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrated (like your PC) and all its parts must work together for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to function. (You can't fly on 2% of a wing).  Built into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data-base of every organism therefore, are instructions to reject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ANY disruptive mutation -- THE VERY MUTATIONS on which neo-Darwinist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory DEPENDS for evolution to occur. And let's be clear about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this - the drosophila experiments showed that ALL mutations are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disruptive and are automatically rejected unless they are part of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally integrated redesign of the entire organism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A drosophila in the ointment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The very changes that scientists failed to achieve with their x-ray
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zappings of drosophila happened over and over in real life in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hawaii, with hundreds of variations (species) developing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isolation from a few original types.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is one of the best and clearest examples of &quot;micro-evolution&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often used to support the Darwinist theory. The other equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate description is &quot;variations WITHIN a kind&quot;, because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most certain finding of modern genetics is that &quot;macro-evolution&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Darwinism) is a scientific impossibility. Fish cannot become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; squirrels. Genetic information boundaries are fixed. Apes can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the fruit-flies in Hawaii, just like the Galapagos finches, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; EVERYTHING ELSE - ever, could only diversify en bloc, complete and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole and fully functioning, into a variation of fruit-fly. But not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a toad, a bat, or a butterfly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm pushing nobody's barrow - there is a consistency here though;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is, that just as the demography of the human race can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonably traced back in a graph to a single family point a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand years ago, so the same can be applied to &quot;micro-evolution&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To take parrots as an example; the huge diversity of hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modern parrot species of different colour, size and behaviour can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen as spin-offs of just a few originals during the last few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand years, (following the Hawaiian drosophila example) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further, we can logically trace them all back to an original pair on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the shoulder of captain Noah, if we so wish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We need to enquire into the mechanism of re-writes of &quot;complete&quot; new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species --Darwin's incremental change fails - and everything that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hangs on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vadar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Take off your skepticles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It is very easy to see that most of the theoretic science of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 19th century was only a relation of reaction against theologic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dogma, and has no more to do with Truth than has a wave that bounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back from a shore. Or, if a shop girl, or you or I, should pull out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a piece of chewing gum about a yard long, that would be quite as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific a performance as was the stretching of this earth's age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several hundred millions of years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --Charles Fort, The Book of the Damned
</em><br>
<p>### All baloney.
<br>
<p>Evolution, micro, macro and in-between, is a fact. Discussing opposing views
<br>
is a waste of time.
<br>
<p>End.
