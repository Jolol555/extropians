<p>I find Brinista more euphonious. I doubt that Brin would actually
<br>
wind up in power. OTOH, as long as we can surveill his ass to a
<br>
faretheewell, it might be poetic justice.
<br>
<p>I'll chip in a few dollars to help pay for a mouthgard if you're
<br>
in danger of chipping teeth if I use &quot;Brinista&quot; again. I have a
<br>
stake, I wrote the anthem.
<br>
<p>&quot;Brinsta&quot;'s a solecism at the moment as far as Google is concerned:
<br>
<p>www.geocities.com/viva_brianistos/Brinista.html
<br>
<p>--and that appears to be a typo.
