Yeh, I see, ta. The field of a primal eye has a kind of background radiation
<br>
effect, so can be just about be described by physics, but physics can't &quot;get
<br>
at it&quot;
<br>
because it existed in the past.
<br>
<p>MVT is an explanation for the evolution, and therefore also functioning of
<br>
E-1
<br>
consciousness;  thus also contributes to the notion of 'observers' and
<br>
the nature of &quot;after life&quot; too maybe. I am interested in your phrase &quot;bath
<br>
of VIRTUAL particles&quot;  ... what does this mean to you exactly? Philosophical
<br>
idealism?
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean? It doesn't make much sense to me. Are you talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; about the uncertainty relations? The uncertainty of position of a
</em><br>

</em><br>
cause
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a mixing of space and time, making the uncertainty a combination of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; both. [Delta x * Delta p &gt;= hbar and Delta t * Delta E &gt;= hbar can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; seen as statements about the spatial and time components of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; relativistic location and momentum vectors].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; OK, yes, this is what I thought... superposition can be viewed as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; uncertainty in time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, that is not that the above says. A quantum superposition is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty. For example, you can have a system with a superposition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the states &quot;spin up&quot; and &quot;spin down&quot;, but when you measure it you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get exactly &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;, not something uncertain. Before you measure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the system you don't know which it will be (and it might be physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible to tell), but that is just lack of knowledge, not the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing as the Heisenberg relations speak of. They show that you cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get more than a certain amount of knowledge about a certain kind of pair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of properties, regardless of how you try.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, a superposition can be more complex than a 50%-50% mix of &quot;up&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;down&quot;, like a 10%-90% mix or even stranger combinations due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interference or entanglement with other systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In that case, if there is a 'lag' between different times, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MVT persistent phantom pineal eye could well have quantum
</em><br>
connectivity
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with our brains because of dual occupancy of time...... no
</em><br>
'physical'
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pineal eye now, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did start to develop in us embryonically, so has a biological
</em><br>
latency
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and pattern, so maybe has an engram or organisational effect in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brains on quantum level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This doesn't make much sense either. Note that the uncertainty
</em><br>
relations
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't say that things have to happen at separate times, and in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; case relativity makes the concept of 'simultaneously' disappear - two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; events that occur at different times to one observer can appear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; simultaneous to another observer who is moving relative to the first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is a fairly mundane point and not what I am trying to find out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Must admit that I am fishing a bit here, and not too up to speed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theoretical physics. I guess there are just &quot;observers&quot; ultimately,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and Shrodingers cat &amp;c. are just observer-related effects .., but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to know if sub atomic particles (which are not directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; observable, and can only be inferred by their effects) leave some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of &quot;trail&quot; or prescence in space over time? Is a donut that once was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; solid but now a ring absolutely identical with a donut that was made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as a ring and always that shape, even if the two are atomically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equivalent now?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm, some kind of memory effect? Since everything reacts with the bath
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of virtual particles around them, I would say that there is a kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;memory&quot; of how the donut looked in the past in the background radiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (technically, it would be a difference in the multipole distribution).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But just like spoken words vanish once they are spoken, this information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets diluted into noise. The words reflect from walls and objects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turning into mechanical vibrations that become heat. This heat diffuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere, but in principle the information is not lost. In practice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you cannot reconstruct it from the heat without producing more entropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (otherwise thermodynamics wouldn't work). The donut and radiation fields
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is much the same. So nothing is lost, we just can't get it.
