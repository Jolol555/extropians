<p><em>&gt; Mike Butler quoted an interesting piece by Nick Cohen from the Guardian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporting an Iraq invasion, which includes this pointer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt; Makiya, Salih and their comrades are fighting the political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; battle of their lives against those 'Anglo-American audiences' in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerhouses of London and Washington who oppose a democratic settlement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Makiya's] piece in turn is well worth reading, and extremely disturbing:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12239,896611,00.html">http://www.observer.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12239,896611,00.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How a US blueprint for post-Saddam government quashed the hopes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic Iraqis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kanan Makiya - Sunday February 16, 2003 - The Observer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The United States is on the verge of committing itself to a post-Saddam plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a military government in Baghdad with Americans appointed to head Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ministries, and American soldiers to patrol the streets of Iraqi cities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The plan, as dictated to the Iraqi opposition in Ankara last week by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United States-led delegation, further envisages the appointment by the US of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an unknown number of Iraqi quislings palatable to the Arab countries of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gulf and Saudi Arabia as a council of advisers to this military government.
</em><br>
<p>Now this is a nice problem, doubtlessly polarized also, but
<br>
one that should have reduced commitment to answers.  Should
<br>
the West, after a military victory in Iraq, defer to Arabic
<br>
culture in the world and to the local states of the region,
<br>
or should it defy them and allow indigenous democratic forces,
<br>
(with whom everyone one here has the most sympathy) to rule?
<br>
<p>I would be willing to bet that (on the American side) Bush,
<br>
Rumsfeld, Rice, and Powell have received many analyses on
<br>
this question, which is new to me at least.  They'll most
<br>
certainly want to do what is best for the U.S.  In particular,
<br>
for U.S. Republicans.  (Tony Blair's party will almost
<br>
certainly want what is best for the U.K., namely what is
<br>
best for Labor in the U.K.)  Such is democracy.
<br>
<p>The BEST understanding I am able to recall ever having had
<br>
on the question &quot;Why did the coalition forces stop the first
<br>
time?&quot; is that they had promised Saudi Arabia and other Arab
<br>
nations that Saddam would be driven off but not toppled.
<br>
(Also, they felt confident that such a reverse would cause
<br>
him to lose power in Iraq from within.)
<br>
<p>So what if the *only* way that is politically feasible to
<br>
replace Hussein is to do so with an Arab autocrat acceptable
<br>
to the non-democratic forces in the region?  What a dilemma.
<br>
