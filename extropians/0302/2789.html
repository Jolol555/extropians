<p>If you give yourself away to humans there is some

regular space travel and WoMD which cannot be

guarded against.  It is has been 100 years since

than 10 years away from leaving the solar system?

<p>I agree there are limits on how much energy can

be expended but effective WoMD do not depend
<br>
solely on energy expended.  Strategy and information
<br>
is as important as energy resources.
<br>
<p>The strategy of hiding does not favor weapons
<br>
which produce huge signatures.  WoMD can exist
<br>
on a large scale without producing large
<br>
signatures.  Bezerker nano-probes, carefully
<br>
directed kinetic energy particles, or neutral
<br>
particle beams might only be be detected
<br>
along the directed path or by having competing
<br>
probes near by.

<p>Distributing your intelligence also brings dangers

of compromise.  Communications between distribution

points can be intercepted, distributed portions may

be captured and analyzed, and distributed portions

may become corrupted or evolve independently.

<p>Moving from the initial conditions of today it would
<br>
seem unlikely to me that a technological civilization
<br>
would remain rooted around any particular star or energy
<br>
source when so little energy is required for brains,
<br>
travel, or civilizations to exist.  During the transition
<br>
time from the beginnings of space travel to grand
<br>
civilizations spanning light years WoMD capable of
<br>
destroying all gains in between will be plentiful.  Big
<br>
centralized targets in the process of being built are
<br>
fine targets for fusion bombs which can vaporize whole
<br>
continents for less cost than a single space shuttle
<br>
flight.

the result.

those thinking ahead realize any encounter involves

replicates beyond its ability to maintain centralized

control.

<p>No doubt this is true today.  Geometric replication

and advancing technology can change this in short

order.  The time scale others plan on may be entirely
<br>
different than how we plan things.
