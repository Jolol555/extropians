Humania intoned:
<br>
&lt;&lt;You falcons do not seem to realize that the US will be an aggressor no
<br>
matter how terrible Sadam is. It is against international law to invade a 
<br>
country
<br>
under the given circumstances. And the way the Bush administration
<br>
disregards the objections of the rest of the world is unbearable. Don't you
<br>
see, that the US is internationally isolated , not Germany or France.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Or, France and Germany will be internationally isolated as the Axis of 
<br>
Appeasement :-D  France just invited Mugabe to the Elysee' Palace for brunch. 
<br>
And you want to stand with such cynics as Chirac?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Desert Storm One: approximately 300.000 Iraqis dead. No true
<br>
democratic nation can get away with this kind of aggression. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Mass death is surely possible, but I have to ask. Are those death counts 
<br>
supplied by the current Iraqi news service, a friendly to Iraq publication. 
<br>
Is this factual. Source seems unbiased?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I sincerely
<br>
hope that Bush and Rumsfeld and their submissive ally states will be dragged
<br>
in front of the Hague tribunal and be punished and thrown in prison. But no:
<br>
Bush will be reelected and the murderers receive an enthusiastic parade on
<br>
their return home.
<br>
<p>Now THAT is really sickening to know&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ah! The Mighty Hague Tribunal. But to get to the part where Milosovic could 
<br>
stand trial there, it depended on the US finally forcing the Serbian 
<br>
governement to choose. The Europeans had years to clean their own front 
<br>
steps, and because it wasn't done, America stepped in, after a couple of 
<br>
hundred thousand perished, that is. So now with Iraq, its still look the 
<br>
other way, still pretend everything is nice nice. Not smart! Which is what 
<br>
you can say about Jascha, but you can't say about Rumsfeld! :-D
<br>
<p>Cthulu Lives!
