[two topics that will get me out of my lurk -- space and cars ...]

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Honda makes cars that are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really sweet to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drive. So exactly why are cars like this so unpopular in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US? Is it the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felt need to chauffeur around a stack of kids in something that feels 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;protective&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>As my rant about SUVs 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gregburch.net/cars/suvs.html">http://www.gregburch.net/cars/suvs.html</a>
<br>
<p>I referred to points out, I think your suggestion is a big part of it.
<br>
I think manufacturers who can provide the same feeling of &quot;security&quot;
<br>
that an SUV provides in a vehicle with better weight and aerodynamic
<br>
characteristics will be able to succeed in tapping into this urge.  Many
<br>
of the &quot;SUVish&quot; class of so-called &quot;cross-over&quot; vehicles do this: They
<br>
are really large cars, since they have monocoque structure, independent
<br>
rear suspensions and don't weigh as much as the pickup-based kind of
<br>
SUVs.  I toy with designs that could do this even better in my
<br>
drive-time mental wanderings.  Since the vast majority of car-buyer's
<br>
decisions are made on the purely superficial visual characteristics of a
<br>
car, I think this could be done.
<br>
<p>Another thing to think about is that, even though America's roads *are*
<br>
being increasingly blighted by the gigantism of SUVs, there are still
<br>
*plenty* of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars on America's roads.  I'm
<br>
sure (couldn't lay my hands on good figures in a minute of googling,
<br>
though) that the U.S. fleet of fuel-efficient cars is larger than any
<br>
other country's total fleet.  I see *lots* of small, efficient cars on
<br>
Houston's freeways, and this is the absolute heart of &quot;truck country&quot;.
