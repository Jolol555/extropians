</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, yes, this is what I thought... superposition can be viewed as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty in time.
</em><br>
<p>No, that is not that the above says. A quantum superposition is not
<br>
uncertainty. For example, you can have a system with a superposition of
<br>
the states &quot;spin up&quot; and &quot;spin down&quot;, but when you measure it you will
<br>
get exactly &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;, not something uncertain. Before you measure
<br>
the system you don't know which it will be (and it might be physically
<br>
impossible to tell), but that is just lack of knowledge, not the same
<br>
thing as the Heisenberg relations speak of. They show that you cannot
<br>
get more than a certain amount of knowledge about a certain kind of pair
<br>
of properties, regardless of how you try. 
<br>
<p>Also, a superposition can be more complex than a 50%-50% mix of &quot;up&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;down&quot;, like a 10%-90% mix or even stranger combinations due to 
<br>
interference or entanglement with other systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; In that case, if there is a 'lag' between different times, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; MVT persistent phantom pineal eye could well have quantum connectivity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; with our brains because of dual occupancy of time...... no 'physical'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; pineal eye now, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; did start to develop in us embryonically, so has a biological latency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and pattern, so maybe has an engram or organisational effect in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; brains on quantum level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This doesn't make much sense either. Note that the uncertainty relations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't say that things have to happen at separate times, and in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; case relativity makes the concept of 'simultaneously' disappear - two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; events that occur at different times to one observer can appear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simultaneous to another observer who is moving relative to the first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a fairly mundane point and not what I am trying to find out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Must admit that I am fishing a bit here, and not too up to speed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretical physics. I guess there are just &quot;observers&quot; ultimately,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Shrodingers cat &amp;c. are just observer-related effects .., but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to know if sub atomic particles (which are not directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observable, and can only be inferred by their effects) leave some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;trail&quot; or prescence in space over time? Is a donut that once was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solid but now a ring absolutely identical with a donut that was made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a ring and always that shape, even if the two are atomically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent now?
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, some kind of memory effect? Since everything reacts with the bath 
<br>
of virtual particles around them, I would say that there is a kind of 
<br>
&quot;memory&quot; of how the donut looked in the past in the background radiation 
<br>
(technically, it would be a difference in the multipole distribution). 
<br>
But just like spoken words vanish once they are spoken, this information 
<br>
gets diluted into noise. The words reflect from walls and objects, 
<br>
turning into mechanical vibrations that become heat. This heat diffuses 
<br>
everywhere, but in principle the information is not lost. In practice 
<br>
you cannot reconstruct it from the heat without producing more entropy 
<br>
(otherwise thermodynamics wouldn't work). The donut and radiation fields 
<br>
is much the same. So nothing is lost, we just can't get it.
