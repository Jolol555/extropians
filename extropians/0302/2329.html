<em>&gt; we excel and watch computers catch up again ... ;-)
</em><br>
<p>We have that game: the Turing test.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The long-standing challenge of the Turing test still hasn't been

</em><br>
<p>Not so fast.  Chess computers climbed the chess
<br>
ranks in 50 years.  Simplifying a little, tournament
<br>
chess  has seven ranks, D, C, B, A, expert, master
<br>
and grandmaster.  When I was in college in 1980, the
<br>
commercially available software was just breaking into
<br>
the Cs.  They climbed a rank about every four years
<br>
since then, with this year being the landmark year
<br>
where commercial software can be considered about
<br>
equal to the top human grandmaster.
<br>
<p>When Turing envisioned the Turing test whereby one
<br>
would converse with a computer and not be able to
<br>
tell it from a human, he was describing a grandmaster
<br>
Turing machine.
<br>
<p>I would suggest we have D rated, and perhaps C rated
<br>
Turing machines today, as demonstrated by the guy who
<br>
set up an Eliza-like program to converse over the
<br>
internet in a teen chat group.  Modern teenagers
<br>
generally have never heard of Eliza, the simulated
<br>
psychologist that their parents had so much fun with
<br>
when they were teens.
<br>
<p>I no longer have the URL, perhaps someone here has
<br>
it.  But he posted a number of e-conversations between
<br>
C and D rated intellects (the teenagers), some of
<br>
which conversed with Eliza for *an hour or more*
<br>
never realizing their correspondant was a machine!
<br>
Of those few that did eventually catch on, it was
<br>
because the machine responses were too fast.  Many
<br>
of them made comments such as &quot;damn you type fast.&quot;
<br>
Several of them thought it was a lascivious old man
<br>
but they generally didn't figure out it was a
<br>
computer.
<br>
<p>I would suggest that this exercise is a demonstration
<br>
of a C rated Turing machine, about where computer
<br>
chess was 25 years ago.  I am not suggesting that
<br>
machines will climb a rank every 4 or 5 years, but
<br>
the point is we should expect software to improve
<br>
steadily, not pop out suddenly at grandmaster
<br>
strength in the Turing test.
<br>
<p>Some of those conversations were so hilarious. Teen
<br>
girls would say to the machine &quot;...you are such a
<br>
good listener, we should meet offline...&quot; etc. I
<br>
thought I was going to wet my diapers.
<br>
<p>Anyone still have that URL?   spike
