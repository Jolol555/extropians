Anders Sandberg said, in this and similar universes:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My current late evening impression is that the worlds where you see a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-classical behavior have measure zero - i.e. are never experienced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm, I *thought* I understood it, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://neon.airtime.co.uk/users/station/m-worlds.htm#Q23">http://neon.airtime.co.uk/users/station/m-worlds.htm#Q23</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests I might have been wrong.
</em><br>
<p>That FAQ concludes:
<br>
<p>&lt; Note: no finite sequence of outcomes is excluded from happening, since the
<br>
concept of probability and randomness only becomes precise only as N goes to
<br>
infinity [H]. Thus, heat could be observed to flow from a cold to hotter
<br>
object, but we might have to wait a very long time before observing it. What
<br>
is excluded is the possibility of this process going on forever. &gt;
<br>
<p>I suppose the obvious answer to my question is that usually everything we
<br>
see is compiled of Vast numbers of small events. In any given universe, many
<br>
photons might indeed not take the least path, but the tendency of the rest
<br>
actually *is* to do so (that is what we *call* the least path; if it were
<br>
something else we'd call that the least path [maybe] ), hence the compounded
<br>
effect is that in any given universe a light beam takes the shortest
<br>
possible path under the prevailing circumstances, say. How this works for
<br>
*individual* photons when they are observed escapes me, though.
<br>
<p>However, as I've speculated previously, if we set up some perturbable system
<br>
so that quantum effects are amplified (the Cat, say, or a psychokinesis
<br>
experiment like the one run at Fourmilab), any given universe must by chance
<br>
experience stretches of aberrant events. Since superstitious error leads
<br>
some people to expect `mind over matter' to occur, many universes will
<br>
contain parapsychological experiments. In some of those universes, an
<br>
anomalous sequence of binary events (for example; but a levitating table is
<br>
harder to explain) will happen during an early experiment. This is taken as
<br>
confirmation of the theory, but subsequent observations fail, in almost all
<br>
worlds, to `confirm' the PK effect. In a few worlds, as chance would have
<br>
it, another sequence does follow. Those parapsychologists get excited; their
<br>
beliefs seem corroborated. And so on.
<br>
<p>(Where this fails as an account of PK, Ganzfeld experiences and other lab
<br>
parapsychology results, FWIW, is that very few universes could be expected
<br>
to show repeatability even of this accidental sort. Our history does show
<br>
it, yet there seems no reason why we should inhabit such a peculiar
<br>
far-out-on-the-tail cosmos.)
