Michael opines
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A very significant stumbling block on the way to the kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; amity which ought to be possible emerges when one looks at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the driving dynamic of [poorer and more backward] places
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Roughly, it reads as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;_Finally_ we can get those &lt;x&gt; bastards back.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Resentment against achievement seems to be wired-in in
<br>
most of us to some degree or other, and we have to fight its
<br>
control.
<br>
<p>Mez adds
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, I agree.  This has sabotaged peace again and again the world over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still, while we can't prevent this, we can reduce its likelihood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rich people are less into this kind of revenge than poor people.
</em><br>
<p>Are you implying that poor people, who indeed are more prone
<br>
to this jealousy or irrational urge for revenge, become less
<br>
envious or irrational if you give them money?  Quite the
<br>
contrary---unconsciously, at least, it's a slap in the face.
<br>
All people's self-image is crucial.  Relevantly here, the
<br>
most important thing is to remove obvious oppressors, but
<br>
beyond that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People in democracies with a police force and a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect for law are less likely to engage in revenge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than people in functional anarchies or dictatorships.
</em><br>
<p>We are agreed.  And let us not forget Rafal's list, which
<br>
I thought slightly better than yours:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;### I fully agree with you that dumping money on the corrupt rulers of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;poor people is highly counterproductive.  In this context, American
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;occupation of Afghanistan (and later Iraq) offers the opportunity to give
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;real help, not to be diverted to nefarious schemes and Swiss bank accounts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(well, at least not all of it).  Instead, basic education, sound fiscal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policy, support for the legal systems, protection of the free markets,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;building of protected free trade zones in areas under US control, giving the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;locals an economic stake in the benefits of the zones, expansion of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;orderly way of business across the land, access to information, and even, in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;some special cases, limited humanitarian help, could eventually make a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;difference.
<br>
<p>A fine list, worthy of dissection.  On each item, one must ask &quot;Why
<br>
didn't the World Bank or the IMF try this?  Or... did they?&quot;
<br>
<p>Mez again:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The desire for retribution is one of the reasons that, if the US goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into Iraq, it needs to be prepared to stay there for a long time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come to put that country back on its feet.
</em><br>
<p>It may be a paradox.  The democratic tendencies there will be
<br>
so unstable that it could take a generation.  Yet for psychological
<br>
reasons, perhaps just as in Afghanistan, it may be necessary to 
<br>
&quot;let go&quot; right away.  Right now, it may be the wisest course for
<br>
the U.S. to *appear* to be doing little for the Karzai government.
<br>
That way, the Afghanis could begin to develop the skills necessary
<br>
to manage by themselves---and weave towards progress.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, if the U.S. were secretly providing assistance,
<br>
then (as others have pointed out) it would be in the eyes of
<br>
both Arab extremists and leftists in America and Europe just
<br>
more imperialism.
