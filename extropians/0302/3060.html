</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's only futile if you assume the point of all arguments is to 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; never the case.  In political forums the point of argument is seldom

<em>&gt; to persuade the person one is ostensibly arguing with the point is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make some sort of impression on the far greater numbers of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people listening in.
</em><br>
<p>You are definitely on to something here.  The key question that will
<br>
shed light on this is: &quot;How different would the discussions be if
<br>
they were between N*(N-1)/2 pairs instead of between N people?&quot;
<br>
<p>Many people's behavior would be substantially different.  They
<br>
(a) feel quite driven by a cause, or (b) don't realize what an
<br>
infinitesimal effect their exhortations really have and what
<br>
a limited number of people are going to even hear them.  And
<br>
so if they were just talking to one other person, they'd have
<br>
a lot less energy.  They might even wax more contemplative!
<br>
<p>But I don't think that what most people write would
<br>
change very much.  I've continued off-line discussions
<br>
with some very rational people, and you couldn't tell
<br>
the difference!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In political forums it is more often numbers that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; count, not the power of an argument.
</em><br>
<p>Another deep point.  Who here can claim never to be 
<br>
affected by numbers?  If I had found, when I joined
<br>
this list, that everyone else interested in immortalism
<br>
and the other Extropian Principles was a flaming leftist,
<br>
I would have been affected.  But just as my atheism since
<br>
age 18, and my political convictions all through college
<br>
survived the weight of numbers, I'd probably still just
<br>
suppose that as clearly as you all thought on other issues,
<br>
you were just disturbingly and wrongly unified on political
<br>
matters for some strange reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A powerful argument is only of interest politically when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it results in larger numbers of people agreeing with what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you (or your government) want them to agree with. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and as I said before, that's not going to happen.
<br>
Especially here.  Now when certain celebrities speak,
<br>
e.g. Michael Jackson, or even certain economists, many
<br>
listen.  But for 99.999 percent of us, no way: we won't
<br>
be really be *listened* to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It would be like me trying to argue that two people on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; list I don't know, but I heard [about] from this third person,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are idiots.  The argument is meaningless.
</em><br>
<p>But after you do know something about them, it becomes
<br>
less so.  For example, if you're into sports (I certainly
<br>
am not) or even into chess, you become familiar with some
<br>
personalities.  So if a certain grandmaster chimes in on
<br>
an argument between Fischer and Spassky, then it could be
<br>
far from meaningless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's only meaningless if you keep thinking in two dimensions as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an argument being basically about two adversaries engaged in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a search for the truth. If you think that the speakers are speaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the benefit of the audience then a lot more things will make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense.
</em><br>
<p>All true.  But I still say that (as above) you can have
<br>
rather heated-sounding arguments between people committed
<br>
to the truth.  Consider the fiery debate between the
<br>
mathematicians Cantor and Kronecker for an extreme example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The truth is almost never the point in political discourse, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political discourse is concerned with creating an environment that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will facilitate a particular outcome and this usually takes numbers.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.  (How's that for cooperativeness ;-)  The truth really *is*
<br>
often the whole point.  I was in a long debate with my opposite 
<br>
number, Jeff Davis, on this list a few months ago.  We both totally
<br>
agreed on the existence of the truth, and how we both wanted it very
<br>
badly.  Using my experience in such matters, I readily came to believe
<br>
that he was sincere.  We had two primary differences:  he believed
<br>
that one of us could have the Absolute Truth and that the other
<br>
was Dead Wrong, while I believed that we simply had different
<br>
ideologies based (probably) on deep underlying value differences.
<br>
Secondly, he is a leftist, and I'm a libertarian/conservative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The  first question of an argument should be &quot;what are we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hoping to solve&quot; [if the answer is &quot;nothing&quot; then] what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the point?
</em><br>
<p>I totally agree.  I would prefer that while, yes, it's helpful
<br>
to get criticism of one's highest level opinions (e.g., &quot;Invading
<br>
Iraq is wrong&quot;), you'd think that intelligent people would tire
<br>
rather quickly of the same old arguments going on and on.
<br>
<p>But they don't tire of it.  There are several reasons that I 
<br>
know of for this.  One is that they seriously can't believe
<br>
that their political adversaries have logically consistent
<br>
arguments.  (Sure, if you haven't been arguing politics for
<br>
years, you might think that, but seriously...how can experienced
<br>
people possibly believe this??)  Since it is so hard to believe,
<br>
they just keep hammering away, evidently without suspecting that
<br>
the deep ideological divisions are based on value differences,
<br>
or perhaps even personality differences.
<br>
<p>One other reason is the pure entertainment of it.  It's sometimes
<br>
fun to see if you can eloquently expose a flaw in someone else's
<br>
arguments---almost like a chess game.
<br>
<p>Third, some current events trouble one at a deep level, and
<br>
discussion with others is cathartic.  Expressing yourself,
<br>
and seeing what others think about these troubling issues,
<br>
scratches that itch.
