</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Okay, imagine a fairly full-on nuclear exchange causes a dark 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;nuclear winter of several months' duration. Imagine further that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;global climate thereafter tips over into something like ice-age 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;temperatures. I'm stuck with this scenario so I don't want debate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;about its plausibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;IF it happened like this, what would the major tropical/equatorial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;forests of places like Brazil look like after, say, 15-30 years? 
</em><br>
<p>Keep in mind that the earth's atmosphere is divided into bands much
<br>
like Jupiter's. Each band tends to have it's own climate range.
<br>
<p>The equatorial regions would tend to retain the most heat the longest,
<br>
so while there may be die offs of animals who were too specialized,
<br>
keep in mind that any likely nuclear exchange would not involve both
<br>
hemispheres at the same time. Few people are that interested in
<br>
wrecking the infrastructure of Australia, Argentina, or South Africa.
<br>
<p>If the north had a large nuclear exchange, this nuclear winter would
<br>
set up a wind system that would tend to isolate the north from the
<br>
equatorial regions such that the equatorial regions would only have the
<br>
southern hemisphere to dump it's heat into.
<br>
<p>So, I can forsee the southern hemisphere getting hotter as the northern
<br>
hemisphere gets colder.
<br>
<p>This might trigger the collapse of the Antarctic ice cap if it gets hot
<br>
enough (at least 10-15 degrees warmer).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Presumably they would die but a lot of the big trees would remain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;standing. What sort of new vegetation could we expect to grow in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;what waa left of these jungles? It is difficult to imagine that many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of the original animals would survive but some kind of animal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;life...if only the proverbial cockroaches...might thrive. I'm not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;even sure of what temperatures we would get in these regions. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Presumably they would be fairly mild even if the temperate zones 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;were now very cold, even in summer.
</em><br>
<p>Monkeys and cats can live in many different climates, so I'd expect
<br>
them to live. Frogs and other cold blooded animals might have trouble.
<br>
I would expect any real climate change in the equator to be devastating
<br>
for those indigenous groups which are highly specialized for their
<br>
areas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Does anyone have the kind of expertise to have an informed idea on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;these points?
</em><br>
<p>Contact my cousin, Andrew Lorrey, at the University of Aukland, where
<br>
he is working on his doctorate in climatology, specifically with
<br>
regards to the El Nino/La Nina and North Atlantic Cycle phenomena.
