Hi Extropes,
<br>
<p>I've been trying to come up with a game theoric solution to a
<br>
hypothetical problem that has the manifestations of the Iraq crisis.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure I've actually got it, but I entertained myself for a while
<br>
and there may be some merit in it.  I had intended to develop the
<br>
solution to a Saddam's-regime-replaced with-no-life-lost-at-all-
<br>
point but,... well there just wasn't enough room in the margin. So
<br>
this goes only to first base. I think it cracks the stand-off caused 
<br>
by there being no standard against which to test the we-need-to
<br>
-go-to-war-on-this-occasion thesis.
<br>
<p>(I imagine the &quot;solution&quot; should be read as thought it were a fairy 
<br>
story and then the question could be asked - so why couldn't this 
<br>
work in reality if everyone else on the planet also read it.
<br>
<p>I'm intrigued by the observation that Axelrod found that he could 
<br>
teach tit-for-tat to gamers playing iterative prisoners dilemma and 
<br>
that despite the fact that it was public even those who knew that
<br>
the strategy could not beat it.
<br>
<p>-------(Let the fairy story begin and THEN lets test it for truth)--
<br>
<p>Although nations are aggregates of multiple decision makers, in all
<br>
countries, ultimately, *the* decision is made by one person.
<br>
<p>Agents who get to decide:
<br>
<p>&quot;Rogue leader&quot; as per 1441
<br>
------------------------
<br>
Iraq:     Saddam Hussein.

USA:                             George W Bush

France:                          Jacques Chirac
<br>
UK:                               Tony Blair
<br>
<p>Russian Federation:        Vladimir Putin
<br>
China:                            Li Peng

<br>
-----------------------
<br>
<p>The Iraq Crisis can be seen as an instance of a multi-player game
<br>
where one player Bush of the United States has &quot;the move&quot;. Bush
<br>
has &quot;the move&quot; because he has his military in place and can exercise
<br>
the option to use it or to postpone using it for as many increments
<br>
of time as he chooses. Bush also has &quot;the move&quot; because any move
<br>
any other player makes can be safely ignored by Bush until he makes
<br>
a move but the converse is not true. There are pressures on Bush (an
<br>
elected leader) both not to move-too-soon and not to delay-too-long. 
<br>
Nonetheless, for now, Bush does have &quot;the move&quot; and in having 
<br>
&quot;the-move&quot; he has the power to put propositions to other decision
<br>
makers and to be seen to do so if he so chooses.
<br>
<p><pre>
----
Once this game theoric solution becomes common knowledge,
Hussein essentially has no moves other than to choose self destruction
or survival.
Once this game theoric solution becomes common knowledge, Chirac
has no moves other than to-ignominy or to-non-ignominy (which could
include some credit and fame).
Once this game theoric solution becomes common knowledge, Bush
has no moves other than to-ignominy or to-non-ignominy (which could 
include some credit and fame).
Bush to move first (and win resoundingly if he makes no error)
Bush to approach Chirac publicly.
Bush to Chirac. &quot;We don't currently have a standard of proof for
determining the basis on which the Security Council should go to
war and clearly we need one. Please propose a standard.&quot;
Then Chirac has the move. (Chirac also to win if he makes no error).
(Chirac then must propose a practical standard - for example
something like &quot;proof-beyond-all-reasonable doubt&quot; but not &quot;proof-
beyond-all-shadow-of-a-doubt&quot; is used in murder trials. A similar
practical standard is needed for the Security Council to be able to
make the decision to go to war or else the lack of a practical standard
will make it impossible for the Security Council to make its decisions
against it, and, as a consequence the Security Council will not be able
to fulfil its purpose to maintain international security and it will not be
able to do this because Chirac could not come up with a standard
which was a necessary first step. When history called on him Chirac
will either answer the call or be judged as having failed to do so
henceforth and forever).
So Chirac produces a standard or he is shown to not produce a
standard and the French position as a permanent member of the
Security Council is shown to be inept at best and obstructionist at
worse - in either case the failure of the Security Council will not
be Bush's failure-to-try it will be Chirac's public failure-to-rise-to-the
-occasion, and so, with a clear conscience Bush may deem the
Security Council unable to perform its duty and he must then 
withdraw from the UN Charter and act unilaterally with a coalition
of the willing and Chirac, not he, will be responsible for the failure of
the Security Council and the United Nations. And Chirac will
be seen to be responsible by the rest of the world.
So Chirac (choosing the win path) will produce a general practical
standard for the Security Council against which particular cases
can be used by Security Council members as the basis for 
determining whether or not there is sufficient grounds for the Security
Council to authorise a war to remove the head of a Nation state.
(And will a few extra downstream details everyone lives after the
crisis).
