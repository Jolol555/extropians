Mirthful Damien B. opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;You're only urging this course of action, you poisonous little Australian
<br>
toad, because in your hatred of these United States you hope to see our
<br>
defenseless land crushed like a sacrificial lamb beneath of the Icelander
<br>
jackboot. And I know why you're doing it, you want to get all that sugar,
<br>
you miserable unpatriotic worm. It's a disgrace to be on the same list with
<br>
you.
<br>
Take care, Damien Broderick&gt;&gt;

<br>
*Iceland as Mr. Crocker had earlier noted has fired no scuds.
<br>
*Iceland has employed no Sarin gas against its purported citizenry -Kurds
<br>
*Ice apparently has not initiated aggression against its neighbors
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-caveat on this issue, but it needed to be said.
<br>
*Iceland apparently has no nuclear explosives program, but has gone
<br>
geothermal.
<br>
*Iceland hasn't attempted to build Gerald Bull's supergun
<br>
*Iceland has not embarked on a massive smallpox propagation program.
<br>
* Iceland has not yet attempted to test technetium as a radioactive agent.
<br>
* Iceland has prepared no drones to release technetium from the air.
<br>
* Iceland apparently hasn't allied itself with Islamist groups like Al Qeida
<br>
* Iceland has not apparently used murder and mutilation of dissidents and
<br>
their 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;family members (via Uday's Group 999) as the means of staying in power.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>When will you pacifist, un-american scum realise the cost of your apologist
<br>
ways? For example, you note that Iceland has gone geothermal. I've just
<br>
searched the web and not found one reference to possible dangers inherent in
<br>
the use of geothermal energy, or its possible use as a weapon. Not one! That
<br>
must tell even the most stupified observer that something is up. It is
<br>
blindingly obvious that Iceland has some big plans to cover up with respect
<br>
to geothermal energy, and has gone to *great lengths* to do just that.
<br>
<p>As to links with Al Qaeda, this article explains how Iceland is part of a
<br>
group hampering the freezing of Al Qaeda funds (ie: basically funding Al
<br>
Qaeda)...

<br>
<p>On subjects nuclear, note Iceland's interest in radioactive waste
<br>
repositories. Now why would they need any such thing if they weren't
<br>
WMD-hungry terrorist sympathisers?

<p>Israelis killed Gerald Bull, and you can find out about the Israel-Icelandic
<br>
connection here. Les
