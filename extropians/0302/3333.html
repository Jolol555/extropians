I wondered:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  If I should survive the global clean sweeping he has in mind, any
</em><br>
pacifist
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from this list: please visit me in my CLIP - CLinic (for) Insane
</em><br>
Pacifists -
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and report me if America really has already returned to Cincinnatus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; farming or if they are still busy building new CLIPS.
</em><br>
<p>And Samantha invited me to her cuckoo-nest cell:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the world survives you can come visit me in the next room any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time you like.  We can compare delusions of hope, peace and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global prosperity and well-being.  We can get really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out-of-our-minds crazy and talk about a glorious future where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans transcended their slightly evolved monkey state and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prospered beyond any decent person's dreams.
</em><br>
<p>We also might muse about some new uploading techniques that are not
<br>
available yet. I would really like to expand the body-mind-continua of some
<br>
of our war supporters into the bodies of ALL wounded but survived Iraqi
<br>
civilians after Desert Storm II with no more arms and legs and their guts
<br>
being fallen out so our hawks might experience their pain in a 10 second
<br>
wave of encompassing sympathy. This therapy device and the fierce
<br>
determination to defend my pacifist live with a gun if necessary could be a
<br>
new kind of active pacifism that might win the respect of those who
<br>
call us insane today.
<br>
<p>Talking about this I remember a comic I saw in the 1970s where some hippies
<br>
ran away from the police. They passed a mansion with a huge iron fence and
<br>
there were iron flowers woven into this fence. So, one of the hippies
<br>
stopped, grabbed one of the iron flowers, turned around and waited for the
<br>
policemen with the flower in his hand, ready to fight. The comic was titled
<br>
&quot;flower power&quot;.
<br>
<p>And we should definetely keep online contact with the people of Spain.
<br>
Though their president is one of the most submissive vassals of the Bush
<br>
administration, 91 - ninety-one - per cent of the Spanish people is against
<br>
a war on Iraq. There were five million people protesting in many Spanish
<br>
cities last weekend. I bet no important US newspaper wrote about those
<br>
events. If Mike Lorrey was right with his insanity statement this would mean
<br>
a never before experienced boom of the American building industry. Imagine
<br>
how many CLIPs (CLinic for Insane Pacifist) they would have to erect in
<br>
Spain to concentrate all the insane in appropriate camps.
<br>
<p>Power to the insane!
<br>
<p>Fight the assholicity of the Iraq war plans!
