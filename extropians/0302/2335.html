<p>Mass. It's not even close. Even if both cars are bigger, it still helps.

When a vehicle crashes, its size is the attribute of the vehicle that most
affects the occupants' injury risk. Larger vehicles offer more protection in
crashes mainly because they are heavier. Their larger dimensions also
provide increased protection. Relations between injury risk and vehicle
weight are among the most reliably established findings in traffic-safety
research. When a car crashes into another that is twice as heavy, the driver
in the lighter car is 12 times as likely to die as the driver in the heavier
car. But such large weight disparities are rare. The most common weight
disparity in a U.S. two-car crash is for one car to be 20 percent heavier
than the other. In that case, the driver of the lighter car is twice as
likely to die as the driver of the heavier car.

If cars of the same mass crash into each other, each will undergo identical
speed changes. However, the risk decreases as the common mass of the
vehicles increases (Figure 7, right). This effect is not because of the mass
but because heavier vehicles are generally larger. The large size provides
more crushable space and therefore more time for the occupants to
decelerate.

In 1966, the United States had the lowest traffic fatality rate in the
world; in the years since then, despite an obsessive focus on vehicle safety
or arguably because of it, the U.S. ranking in the world has steadily
slipped.
The focus on vehicle factors -- factors over which they have no control --
has encouraged American drivers to regard safety as something out of their
control.  The American focus on airbags is one example of this. These were
mandated by a lawyer-led safety agency that claimed safety benefits far in
excess of published technical estimates [9%] and ignored technical
information documenting their harmful effects. Before a drug can be
prescribed in the United States, it must meet two basic standards --
efficacy and safety. Airbags were not shown to meet either, but they were
not merely offered to the public, their installation was required. Now, the
United States is the only country in the world in which it is illegal to
purchase a new car without a device that is known to increase the net harm
to women (Dalmotas et al. 1996) and to increase fatality risk in children
(Glass et al. 2000).

Dad.
