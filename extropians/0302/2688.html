Anders Sandberg:
<br>
<em>&gt;Does the Clinton protestors fit into the narrative of the TV news?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They have a narrative of how war protestors work, a kind of ready-made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;story, with a tone, images and message that reporters, producers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even protestors tend to conform to. There is also the presidential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protest narrative, but it is different. These two narratives cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;combined; the result would feel strange to the reporters and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;producers, and the story would not be sent since it seemed to be less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good than the other stories of the day.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt;We need to get out of these narratives and create our own narratives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even ending up in the &quot;two sides debates a boring issue&quot; narrative would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be great.
</em><br>
<p><p>I wonder who would pay for the TV time for good, thorough debates and
<br>
(boring even) discussions on important issues.
<br>
<p>For a week in middle January, right before I moved from Germany, I
<br>
rented a room in a family's home in Heidelberg- the girl was American
<br>
my age, her spouse was German, three kids. Like most people, they have
<br>
a TV and in the evening when I returned, I sat with them and watched
<br>
some of the TV programs with them. I don't have a TV and it was a
<br>
luxury for me to have them be able to translate some of the language
<br>
phrases and nuances that I didn't get before and to also get a glimpse
<br>
of what was occurring on late night German TV.
<br>
<p>One of the programs I remember particularly well was a Thursday
<br>
evening talk show of an intense discussion with ~6
<br>
politicians/political party people and one journalist: Peter Arnett.
<br>
They were (of course) discussing the possible war in Iraq, and trying
<br>
to understand the Bush administration motivations for such a war. At
<br>
one point Arnett said: &quot;You know you would never see such a discussion
<br>
as this on American TV.&quot;
<br>
<p>He's right, you know. So why not? Why is the current narrative of
<br>
the U.S. media in Bush's back pocket, if policies are forged that
<br>
affects everyone's (U.S. citizen's and others) lives? Who is paying
<br>
for that narrative?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The same is true for other issues. Transhumanism can currently be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shown in the &quot;excentric people and inventions&quot; narrative, the &quot;wonders
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of science&quot; narrative and the frankenscience narrative&quot;. The first one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trivializes us and our ideas - look how cute they are, believing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crazy stuff like cloning and nanotech! The second deals with a gadget
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or idea, reporting about its discovery, nifty features and glorious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future (for fairness a naysayer is always included). The third shows
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how we are making a faustian pact with technology that will cost us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(and everybody else) our souls.
</em><br>
<p>The last narrative is what the media seems to pick up (and someone
<br>
pays for) most easily. How to make the narratives be appealing? Space
<br>
exploration was brought into the limelight again recently, but it took
<br>
a tragedy to occur for the media to think it was a sellable story.
