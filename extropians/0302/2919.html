<em>&gt; &gt; (Emlyn O'regan &lt;<a href="mailto:oregan.emlyn@healthsolve.com.au?Subject=RE:%20War%20with%20Iceland?">oregan.emlyn@healthsolve.com.au</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why isn't the US going to war with Iceland, immediately? I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the doves on this list have provided any solid reasons for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not going to war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with Iceland. And who is any of us to say what the terrible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not going to war with Iceland might be? Iceland says it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't have any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; WMD, but is there proof? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; History very well may prove the peaceniks and commies to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bunch of Chamberlains on this issue. I doubt that the US 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can afford to wait
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and see on matters of potential massive aggression. Given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that no one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; proven beyond doubt that preemptive, proactive defensive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Iceland is unjustified, is there any other moral course of action?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Refresh my memory--when was it that Iceland lobbed SCUDs at Israel,
</em><br>
<p>People from Iceland raided England &amp; Ireland a lot! Rape, pillage, burning
<br>
stuff. Or was that Greenland? Hmm, a dodgy country if ever I saw one. Has
<br>
anyone considered if they might require a pre-emptive strike, too?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and called the US &quot;The Great Satan&quot;, 
</em><br>
<p>I can't find any instances of that, but Iceland is very angry about the US's
<br>
anti-whaling stance.

<br>
They are evil whale killers! They probably use chemical weapons on the
<br>
actual whales! Show me proof that they don't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and tried to assassinate our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President?
</em><br>
<p>This one is out of left field. In any case, how do you know that they
<br>
haven't tried and failed? Or succeeded, in fact? GWB might be an Icelandik
<br>
mole (hard gig, digging in that frozen ground).
