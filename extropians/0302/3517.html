<p><em>&gt; The way this mess should have played out instead is that the EU

<p><p>Well actually the EU had done that! Then Germany and France held a 
<br>
private meeting, where they made up their own minds, and their own 
<br>
statements.
<br>
<p>The other countries then made a reply to that, with the open letter, 
<br>
that just stated the EU's original position. France Chirac then makes 
<br>
this stupid reply.
<br>
<p>So actually Germany and France are acting over the heads of the rest of 
<br>
the EU. Which isn't exactly a nice thing to do, and then they are 
<br>
getting angry when we don't just keep quiet about it.
<br>
<p>When Chirac then makes a statement that the new countries should act 
<br>
more humble, he is making it all to clear to them that they are second 
<br>
rate citizens in Europe. Which is plain stupid just before they are 
<br>
going to vote on joining the EU.
<br>
<p>Chirac is arrogant and no better than Bush.
