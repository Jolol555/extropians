<br>
<p>IRANIANS EAGER FOR HUSSEIN TO BE OUSTED
<br>

<p>By Azadeh Moaveni, Times Staff Writer
<br>
<p>TEHRAN -- Iran would seem to be an unlikely corner of the Middle East to
<br>
find support for Washington's plans to unseat Saddam Hussein. But despite
<br>
decades of poor relations with the U.S. and their pique at being labeled
<br>
part of an &quot;axis of evil,&quot; most Iranians are eager to see the Iraqi
<br>
dictator's demise.
<br>
<p>Those who fought in Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980s and those for whom
<br>
that war is little more than a childhood memory equally want to see
<br>
Hussein's regime toppled. Few doubt that he is dangerous, armed with
<br>
terrible weapons and a bane to the region.
<br>
<p>&quot;The day Saddam Hussein is arrested, killed or exiled, Iranians will pass
<br>
out sweets in the streets,&quot; said Mehdi Ansari, a newspaper vendor. His
<br>
clapboard kiosk on Vali Asr, Tehran's main boulevard, does brisker business
<br>
these days as Iranians follow the latest twists in the U.N. inspection
<br>
effort that they expect will eventually lead to war.
<br>
<p>This enthusiasm for a campaign against Hussein is rare in the Middle East,
<br>
where the prevailing belief holds that the U.S. is targeting Iraq to control
<br>
its oil and ensure Israel's security. America's Arab allies, such as Egypt
<br>
and Saudi Arabia, fear that war with Baghdad will further radicalize their
<br>
already deeply anti-American populations. Iraq has historically been Iran's
<br>
most serious rival for regional influence. Eight years of war drained Iran's
<br>
economy and left deep wounds that still have not healed. The slaughter of
<br>
tens of thousands of young Iranian men by Hussein's forces produced a grim
<br>
culture of martyrdom that the country is still trying to shake.
<br>
<p>At least 300,000 Iranians were killed in the war, and more than half a
<br>
million were wounded.
<br>
<p>However, the depth of Iranian antipathy for Hussein predates both the war
<br>
and the Islamic Revolution of the late 1970s.
<br>
<p>Iranians and Arabs are ethnically and culturally distinct, and a prejudice
<br>
against Arabs has run through Iranian history for centuries. After the
<br>
Iranian national soccer team lost a game to Iraq in 1977, the shah wept
<br>
openly before fans at Tehran's Azadi Stadium.
<br>
<p>Because Iranians speak Persian instead of Arabic and identify with a culture
<br>
that predates Islam, most of them do not have the emotional ties to the
<br>
Israeli-Palestinian conflict that reinforce the anger Arabs feel toward the
<br>
United States, which they see as Israel's sponsor. Iranians do not sleep and
<br>
rise with televised images of Palestinian suffering, as Arabs throughout the
<br>
region do.
<br>
<p>During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Iranians watched with satisfaction as a
<br>
U.S.-led coalition routed Hussein from Kuwait. Where there is ambivalence
<br>
about a new U.S.-led war against Iraq among ordinary Iranians, it often
<br>
stems from a revulsion at the potential human cost rather than animosity
<br>
toward the United States.
<br>
<p>Azzam Rahimi, a 45-year-old homemaker, lost her son in the Iran-Iraq War and
<br>
comes to Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra cemetery every week to visit his grave.
<br>
<p>&quot;Look at all these dead young men,&quot; she said, nodding down a seemingly
<br>
endless stretch of slender gravestones of soldiers killed in the war.
<br>
&quot;They're all here because of war. If there had been no war, so many young
<br>
men wouldn't be lying under the dirt.&quot;
<br>
<p>But Iranians are also well aware of the implications of a new war for
<br>
themselves. If Washington moved to disarm Hussein by force, the result would
<br>
be the third war the U.S. has fought on Iran's borders in 12 years.
<br>
<p>Some Iranians, particularly the young, say they would actually welcome a
<br>
U.S. presence in Iraq because it would increase pressure on both their
<br>
country's conservative Islamic regime and the fractured reformers who oppose
<br>
it. The regime's efforts to portray the U.S. as the &quot;Great Satan&quot; have
<br>
failed to sway young people, who are a clear majority of Iranians. About 70%
<br>
of the country's 70 million people are younger than 30.
<br>
<p>Young people in particular associate the U.S. with the opportunities and
<br>
freedoms that Iran, with its sluggish economy and stern moral code, lacks.
<br>
They believe that better relations with the U.S. would revitalize Iranian
<br>
life and help the country shed its pariah status.
<br>
<p>According to a poll conducted in September, 75% of Iranians support dialogue
<br>
with the U.S., and some believe that a long-term U.S. military presence next
<br>
door could accelerate the process of change in Iran.
<br>
<p>Others, who despair of the clerical regime's capacity for reform, even hope
<br>
that after Iraq, the U.S. will take on Iran.
<br>
<p>The fantasy that the U.S. could swoop in and remove Iran's hard-line regime,
<br>
as it did the Taliban in Afghanistan and threatens to do to Hussein,
<br>
bespeaks the depth of frustration at the pace of internal reforms.
<br>
<p>When newspaper headlines suggest that Washington's resolve may be wavering,
<br>
anxiety sets in.
<br>
<p>&quot;Are they changing their mind?&quot; Goli Afshar, a 23-year-old student, asked as
<br>
she alternately tightened and loosened her grip on a mug at a cafe on Gandhi
<br>
Street. &quot;Can they hurry up with Iraq already, so they can get on with
<br>
attacking us?&quot;
