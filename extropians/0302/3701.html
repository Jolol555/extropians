different political-economic-religious(?) pattern in place.
<br>
<p>Mitch,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder about that.  What I see present on the Extropy list tells me 
<br>
that when we get that souped up technically we will be no more astute 
<br>
political-economic-religious than we are today.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was reading today a couple of speeches given by George Washington.  
<br>
Please remember that Mr. Washington had only two or possibly three years of 
<br>
schooling and in addition was not considered to be anywhere near the 
<br>
intellectual class of Franklin, Jefferson or Adams.  It was obvious that he 
<br>
had a level of education in philosophy and public affairs far beyond even our 
<br>
educated citizens of today.  IMHO we have a far better technical education 
<br>
than Mr. Washington had but we have not spent nearly as much time considering 
<br>
the eternal verities as he had.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me offer you a homely example.  We spend vast numbers of email 
<br>
discussing Transhumanism and ways of getting to that state.  Yet, the average 
<br>
college graduate that I rub elbows are no where near maximizing their 
<br>
personal development.  In other words I see a few scientists working on 
<br>
Extropy or Transhumanism, I hear a lot of speculation but I see little effort 
<br>
expended on goals that are actually attainable.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me offer you another homely example.  There is a man named Warren 
<br>
Buffet that out of his own mind earns the kind of money that would really 
<br>
boost our goals assuming of course that we personally possessed that kind of 
<br>
wealth.  In addition we would be improving our society as a main feature of 
<br>
the Buffet method is to encourage worthy corporations (in humanistic terms) 
<br>
by investing in them.  Yet not only don't the people on this list not know 
<br>
how Mr. Buffet does what he does I have querried 3 or 4 of my accounting 
<br>
instructors (after they had discussed how to invest wisely) about Mr. Buffet 
<br>
-- they hadn't a clue.
<br>
