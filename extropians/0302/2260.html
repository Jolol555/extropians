In this classic research below by Joseph Knoll, lab rats were treated daily
<br>
for life with selegiline (deprenyl) and compared to a control group treated
<br>
with saline water.
<br>
<p>The treated rats:
<br>
<p>1) had better life-long sexual performance (measured probably by total
<br>
mounts and total ejaculations, as in other such studies)
<br>
<p>2) had better learning performance (measured probably with the standard
<br>
sorts of mazes with which we humans like to aggravate lab rats), and
<br>
<p>3) had prolonged life-spans.
<br>
<p>In other words the selegiline (deprenyl) treated rats they lived longer,
<br>
sexier, smarter lives. They were transvermins.  :)

<p>ABSTRACT:
<br>
Sexual performance and longevity.

<p>Knoll J.

<br>
<p>ABSTRACT
<br>
<p>Sexually inactive (&quot;low-performing,&quot; LP) and highly active
<br>
(&quot;high-performing,&quot; HP) rats were selected from a sexually inexperienced
<br>
population. Saline control LP rats (n = 44) lived 134.58 2.29 weeks, their
<br>
HP peers (n = 49) lived 151.24 1.36 weeks. Life-long treatment with 0.25
<br>
mg/kg (-)deprenyl, a selective inhibitor of MAO-B that also stimulates
<br>
action potential-transmitter release coupling in the catecholaminergic
<br>
neurons in the brain (catecholaminergic activity enhancer, CAE, effect),
<br>
enhanced the sexual and learning performance of both LP and HP rats and
<br>
prolonged their life. LP rats (n = 48) treated with (-)deprenyl lived 152.54
<br>
1.36 weeks and HP rats on (-)deprenyl (n = 50) lived 185.30 1.96 weeks. As
<br>
an indicator of the basic activity of catecholaminergic neurons, the resting
<br>
release of dopamine from the striatum, substantia nigra, and tuberculum
<br>
olfactorium, and of norepinephrine from the locus coeruleus, was measured in
<br>
2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-week-old male and female rats. The release of
<br>
transmitters between weaning and the second month of age, i.e., during the
<br>
crucial developmental phase of life, was significantly higher than either
<br>
before or after that period, indicating that a CAE mechanism starts working
<br>
with high intensity after weaning, lasts until the completion of full scale
<br>
sexual development, and shows an unparalleled decay thereafter. It was
<br>
concluded that the CAE regulation in the brain, stimulated by (-)deprenyl,
<br>
controls general activity and consequently the longevity of rats.
