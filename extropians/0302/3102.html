<br>
<p>All those quotes regarding doubts about evolution got me to 
<br>
thinking -specifically, the quote which asserted that no species, 
<br>
not even Drosophila, has even been observed changing into another 
<br>
species...
<br>
<p>Wouldn't it be possible, at least theoretically, to actually _test_ 
<br>
this empirically?
<br>
<p>Given Drosophila's rapid rate of mutation, could one not isolate a 
<br>
population and...I dunno...say repeatedly expose them to radiation 
<br>
or some other stress...heavily alkaline water supply, 
<br>
something...then allow a few generations to survive and breed among 
<br>
themselves. Then one attempts to breed them with an un-mutated 
<br>
control population.
<br>
<p>If the mutant Drosophila couldn't interbreed with the control, but 
<br>
could interbreed with themselves, isn't that one of the determinants 
<br>
of species status?
<br>
<p>Or am I missing something profoundly obvious here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That's a perfectly logical and reasonable suggestion; and is in fact 
<br>
exactly what those decades of &quot;failed&quot; experiments, producing 
<br>
mutants by using x-rays and other external what-nots, were all 
<br>
about. As a consquence of all that scientific effort, the 
<br>
tautology &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; should have been replaced with 
<br>
the much more accurate slogan &quot;rejection of the mutants&quot; as a proper 
<br>
foundation for naturalism. But that would have totally undermined 
<br>
the evolutionary principle, and spoilt the whole established social 
<br>
order; which is running along very profitably without those sort of 
<br>
disruptive heresies, thank you very much. 
<br>
<p>What wasn't understood until quite recently, but is now throughly 
<br>
established, is that every organism, without exception, is totally 
<br>
integrated (like your PC) and all its parts must work together for 
<br>
it to function. (You can't fly on 2% of a wing).  Built into the 
<br>
data-base of every organism therefore, are instructions to reject 
<br>
ANY disruptive mutation -- THE VERY MUTATIONS on which neo-Darwinist 
<br>
theory DEPENDS for evolution to occur. And let's be clear about 
<br>
this - the drosophila experiments showed that ALL mutations are 
<br>
disruptive and are automatically rejected unless they are part of a 
<br>
totally integrated redesign of the entire organism. 
<br>
<p>A drosophila in the ointment.
<br>
The very changes that scientists failed to achieve with their x-ray 
<br>
zappings of drosophila happened over and over in real life in 
<br>
Hawaii, with hundreds of variations (species) developing in 
<br>
isolation from a few original types. 
<br>
<p>This is one of the best and clearest examples of &quot;micro-evolution&quot;, 
<br>
often used to support the Darwinist theory. The other equally 
<br>
appropriate description is &quot;variations WITHIN a kind&quot;, because the 
<br>
most certain finding of modern genetics is that &quot;macro-evolution&quot; 
<br>
(Darwinism) is a scientific impossibility. Fish cannot become 
<br>
squirrels. Genetic information boundaries are fixed. Apes can't 
<br>
become humans. 
<br>
<p>So the fruit-flies in Hawaii, just like the Galapagos finches, and 
<br>
EVERYTHING ELSE - ever, could only diversify en bloc, complete and 
<br>
whole and fully functioning, into a variation of fruit-fly. But not 
<br>
into a toad, a bat, or a butterfly.
<br>
<p>I'm pushing nobody's barrow - there is a consistency here though; 
<br>
which is, that just as the demography of the human race can be 
<br>
reasonably traced back in a graph to a single family point a few 
<br>
thousand years ago, so the same can be applied to &quot;micro-evolution&quot;. 
<br>
To take parrots as an example; the huge diversity of hundreds of 
<br>
modern parrot species of different colour, size and behaviour can be 
<br>
seen as spin-offs of just a few originals during the last few 
<br>
thousand years, (following the Hawaiian drosophila example) and 
<br>
further, we can logically trace them all back to an original pair on 
<br>
the shoulder of captain Noah, if we so wish. 
<br>
<p>We need to enquire into the mechanism of re-writes of &quot;complete&quot; new 
<br>
species --Darwin's incremental change fails - and everything that 
<br>
hangs on it. 
<br>
<p>vadar
<br>
<p>Take off your skepticles.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It is very easy to see that most of the theoretic science of the 
<br>
19th century was only a relation of reaction against theologic 
<br>
dogma, and has no more to do with Truth than has a wave that bounds 
<br>
back from a shore. Or, if a shop girl, or you or I, should pull out 
<br>
a piece of chewing gum about a yard long, that would be quite as 
<br>
scientific a performance as was the stretching of this earth's age 
<br>
several hundred millions of years.
