<p>
Might Singer's position on the severely disabled be a very dangerous one for
<br>
Transhumanism? 
<br>
<p>I would argue that, potentially, humans of average intelligence are to SI as
<br>
the massively mentally retarded are to humans of average intelligence.
<br>
<p>Singer's position seems to be that the intellectually able make decisions
<br>
for those who are unable to make decisions for themselves, because the
<br>
latter lack the facility of decision making. If a Peter Singer SI regards
<br>
average humans as unable to make decisions in any useful way (seeing that,
<br>
on scales relevant to SIs, such humans are unable to make decision sets
<br>
distinguishable from random noise), it might regard average humans as unable
<br>
to usefully make decisions regarding their own welfare. If it also decides
<br>
that humans suffer because of some SI discernable factor (not intelligent
<br>
enough to determine the point of their own existence? Quite possibly), or
<br>
that the happiness cost of killing the poor human is outweighed by the
<br>
happiness benefit from creating a new SI with the human's resources, then
<br>
humans are toast.
<br>
<p>This is a variant of the common fear of stratification in a post-human
<br>
future, into technological/intellectual haves and have nots, the fear being
<br>
that the haves will make decisions for the have nots (which will not be
<br>
pretty, think GATACCA, further down the line). Singer's theory applied to
<br>
Transhumanism is a straight line to the Brave New World meme.
<br>
<p>This is not the route for Transhumanism. We are about individual choice as
<br>
the primary axiom. Morphological freedom is something that I think the
<br>
disabled community would resonate with very strongly (see &quot;Unspeakable
<br>
Conversations&quot;, the author's discussion of her body's shape). Singer's
<br>
utilitarian approach seems to me to lead very quickly to a
<br>
group-dominates-individual situation; there are just too many requirements
<br>
for groups to judge individuals and take actions up to and including
<br>
involuntary euthanasia (wow!).
