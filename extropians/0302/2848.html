As described in the abstract below, selegiline (deprenyl) also blocks
<br>
the neurotoxic effects of MDMA (ecstasy). The mechanism by which
<br>
selegiline protects the brain from ecstasy is relevant to any discussion
<br>
of neuroprotection by selegiline. 
<br>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide is a toxic by-product of the deamination of dopamine
<br>
by MAO-B, one which can cause cell death by lipid peroxidation of cell
<br>
membranes. Selegiline inhibits MAO-B, thus reducing lipid peroxidation.
<br>
<p>This is however just one of the suggested mechanisms by which selegiline
<br>
is neuroprotective, and not the mechanism that I feel is most important.
<br>
In addition to reducing hydrogen peroxide levels, selegiline
<br>
up-regulates the production of SOD and catalase. Numerous experiments
<br>
show life-extension benefits associated with increased levels of these
<br>
two protective antioxidant enzymes.

<br>
<p>ABSTRACT
<br>
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced serotonergic
<br>
neurotoxicity was assessed in the striatum, hippocampus and frontal
<br>
cortex of rats by using [3H]paroxetine binding to label serotonin (5-HT)
<br>
uptake sites and 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels as
<br>
markers of serotonergic function. NMDA (40 mg/kg) induced a significant
<br>
decrease in both [3H]paroxetine binding Bmax and 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels
<br>
7 days after treatment. The monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor L-deprenyl (2
<br>
mg/kg) administered 30 min before MDMA blocked these decreases. MDMA (40
<br>
mg/kg) also maximally increased the formation of thiobarbituric acid
<br>
reactive substances (an indicator of lipid peroxidation) 12 hr after
<br>
treatment in all three brain regions studied. This increase in
<br>
malondialdehyde formation was also blocked by pretreatment with
<br>
L-deprenyl. Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activity was also significantly
<br>
reduced 18 hr after MDMA. L-Deprenyl reversed this decrease in TPH
<br>
activity. Another experiment confirmed that a significant fraction of
<br>
[3H]dopamine uptake into hippocampal synaptosomes was blocked by 500 nM
<br>
fluoxetine, a selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor. These data suggest that
<br>
the deamination by monoamine oxidase-B of excessive dopamine within the
<br>
5-HT terminal generates hydrogen peroxide that may lead to membrane
<br>
lipid peroxidation, and perhaps other oxidative insults, resulting in
<br>
selective 5-HT terminal degeneration subsequent to MDMA treatment.
