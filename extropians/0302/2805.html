<em>&gt; One of the programs I remember particularly well was a Thursday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evening talk show of an intense discussion with ~6
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicians/political party people and one journalist: Peter Arnett.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They were (of course) discussing the possible war in Iraq, and trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to understand the Bush administration motivations for such a war. At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one point Arnett said: &quot;You know you would never see such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion as this on American TV.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He's right, you know. So why not? Why is the current narrative of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. media in Bush's back pocket, if policies are forged that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affects everyone's (U.S. citizen's and others) lives? Who is paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for that narrative?
</em><br>
<p>I'm rather surprised that Peter Arnett, who is well known for his CNN
<br>
work here in the US, would make this sort of statement, but then again,
<br>
not very if he is personally typical of the newsmedia in general.
<br>
<p>Here in the US, we've had more than a decade of dealing with Saddam's
<br>
lies and deceptions. He is a known quantity, and for Americans, the
<br>
idea that there is any reason for any person with an ounce of
<br>
intelligence to have not made up their mind about doing something about
<br>
him by this point in time is ludicrous.
<br>
<p>What surprises me is that so many Germans, and others, seem to think
<br>
that the problem is with Bush and not Saddam. This is a blind spot on
<br>
the part of the Germans. While Arnett might be right about the US, I
<br>
can say the same thing about Germany: Germans do not seem to be
<br>
constitutionally capable of having a rational discussion about the need
<br>
to dispose of Saddam's regieme and free the Iraqi people. 
<br>
<p>Is it because German companies are so complicit in the Iraqi war
<br>
machine? How many German politicians are being paid off by these German
<br>
companies? How many German tv channels are owned by these companies?
<br>
<p>It is understandable that Germans are so hip-deep in their social
<br>
welfare state that the need to keep it financed is the primary domestic
<br>
and foreign policy dog-wagger, such that any policy by any country that
<br>
threatens it is automatically wrong and evil. Even socialists are
<br>
primarily motivated by self-interest, even if it is a collective one.
<br>
Given this, it is understandable that Germans cannot help but look on
<br>
Bush with distain and hate.
<br>
<p>As I've detailed recently, freeing the Iraqi people from Saddam and
<br>
opening Iraqi oil to full exploitation by western industry will cause
<br>
the collapse of the european social welfare infrastructure, because
<br>
doing so means one thing: cheap oil.
<br>
<p>When the French, Germans, and Russians accuse Bush of wanting to
<br>
control the Iraqi oil, they say this only because it is THEY who
<br>
currently have the most control over it, limited as it is by UN
<br>
restrictions. The last thing they want is free and unfettered
<br>
competition by all international oil companies to provide exploitation
<br>
services to the Iraqi government, which will only occur when sanctions
<br>
are lifted after the end of Saddam's regieme.
<br>
<p>Americans know what their self interest is, and that interest is to
<br>
take a principled stand for the liberty of the Iraqi people. I find it
<br>
rather hilarious that the French see no problem with themselves taking
<br>
unilateral action in the Ivory Coast for their own self interest, yet
<br>
continue to call the Anglospheric coalition of the US, Britain,
<br>
Australia, along with countries like Spain, Portugal, Italy, and many
<br>
eastern european nations a 'unilateral' action if we take it outside
<br>
the UN umbrella.
<br>
<p>While the French are preoccupied with teaching the US lessons in
<br>
'liberty' by refusing to extradite convicted murderers (Einhorn as well
<br>
as others) to the US, they also give political sanctuary to tyrants
<br>
like Saddam. Is this teaching us lessons in liberty?
