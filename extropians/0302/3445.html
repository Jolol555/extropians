<p><em>&gt; Barbara,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        The truth is that the US gets little oil from the middle east.  Iraq 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the middle east is where our allies France and Germany get their oil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        If we wanted to attack someone to protect our oil supply we would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack Venezuela or possibly Mexico.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ron h.
</em><br>
<p>But isn't there a global market for oil?  That is, as I understand
<br>
it, all the Alaskan oil goes to Japan, and the U.S. gets its oil
<br>
from Mexico or Venezuela (I guess, as you assert).  But if the
<br>
Mideast oil is cut off, everyone bids the price up, and it doesn't
<br>
really matter where it comes from.
<br>
<p>Yes, the U.S. is probably much more worried about cheap oil than
<br>
is Europe.  After all, if Mike Lorrey is right, then oil at high
<br>
prices suits them just fine---besides, they seem to enjoy having
<br>
their economies in the tank all the time.  But for the nations
<br>
with healthy economies (who does this include besides the U.S.?),
<br>
a lower price of oil will be quite enriching.
<br>
<p>Now, while I don't really like defending the French, here I
<br>
go again.  At least they're not stupid when it comes to
<br>
energy, and now have so much extra capacity from their clean
<br>
nuclear plants that they've got plans to start making and
<br>
selling hydrogen.
