Brian Booth opined:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; think people in the states must realise that the
<br>
anti war Demonstrations are not anti American it is
<br>
just Europes way of saying that we are fed up with
<br>
America throwing it`s wait around internationally..&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Do you really think that most Americans are grateful for your protests; aside 
<br>
form Hollywood foreign policy analyst, Susan Sarandon, of course? My guess is 
<br>
that the plurality of American citizens, whether for the deposition of 
<br>
Saddam's regime or not, are indeed not pleased by such protests. We'd have to 
<br>
see a poltical poll of this to verify it though.
<br>
<p><p><p>&lt;&lt;I and the argument that America has lost the lives of many
<br>
of it`s citizens,America has my sympathies in this
<br>
aspect but if every country started declaring war on
<br>
other countries because they had lost some of their
<br>
citizens through terrorist attacks then there would be
<br>
a war every other week.One must realize that one lands
<br>
pain at tragedy is no greater than any others.Take
<br>
care Brian Booth&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I recognize the &quot;humanity&quot; and the&quot;human condition&quot; that unites us all. Hence 
<br>
my persistence on this list. That being said, you seem to indicate, if I 
<br>
comprehend your position, that therefore the US should do nothing against the 
<br>
apparently predatory, nature of the axis of evil and weasels?  Well, as I 
<br>
have attempted to point out, more than once, on this list, when it happens to 
<br>
you, then you will know. Sorry, Bali was terrible, but Bali ain't Melbourne 
<br>
or Perth. Please remember this post, and when it happens, see if you blame 
<br>
the Americans or the Jihadi?
<br>
<p>Yours in Cthulu,
<br>
