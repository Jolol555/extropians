<br>
overreaction seems to be all you ever conclude when someone disagrees with 
<br>
your particular wrapped-in-the-flag position?
<br>
<p>Damien,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you sure you want to say that?  Wasn't it simply a knee jerk 
<br>
reaction to someone differing with your own political biases?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never wrap myself in a flag.  I defend the US often enough against 
<br>
people that are being devious in their criticism of the US.  But what is 
<br>
wrong with that?  I never attack other countries except it be in retort to 
<br>
something the other has said about my own.  If I read a good book I 
<br>
compliment the author.  I generally speak well of what I see good in other 
<br>
countries.  I don't think I have spoken ill of the UN, Germany or France for 
<br>
their opposition in the UN or in NATO. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yes when more people on this list speak in defense of ben Laden 
<br>
than of my country then I do rise to provide a little balance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, frankly I don't think you are motivated so much by ill will as by 
<br>
your desire to have Uncle Sugar do the things that you believe would benefit 
<br>
you instead of the US.  You are as familiar with the writing of Robert A. 
<br>
Heinlein as I am.  Fifty years ago he wrote about the tendency of the 
<br>
Commonwealth to believe that US should chose its policies for the advancement 
<br>
of the Commonwealth.  You can find that in Tramp Royale.  He made the case 
<br>
then and you haven't changed in the meantime. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I even believe that having the US defeat the Taliban and now to 
<br>
turn its sights on the Baath party could possibly frighten you.  Perhaps that 
<br>
power could be turned against you at a future date.  It could be but it won't 
<br>
and there is no evidence to suggest that is a real danger.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But reread what you have written.  You have made hasty personal 
<br>
attacks before and been called down for it.  Don't you wish to reconsider 
<br>
this one?
<br>
Ron h.
