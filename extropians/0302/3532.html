Earlier on this question (though not on this thread) I mentioned that I 
<br>
believe that EMP devices based on flux compressors were easy to make.  Here 
<br>
is some more detailed information.  To summarize, you can make a device 
<br>
capable of taking out a few blocks of civilian electronics with only a 
<br>
small piece of explosive and some stuff from a hardware sore, and you can 
<br>
fit it into a briefcase.  The military is also considering the use of flux 
<br>
compressors to power weapons like railguns or lasers.
<br>
<p>New Scientist's article on the dangers of EMP weapons:

<br>
to stupidity what might be due to ignorance.  And try not to assume you 
<br>
opponent is the ignorant one-until you can show it isn't you.
