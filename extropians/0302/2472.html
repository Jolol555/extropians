<em>&gt; (Gary Miller &lt;<a href="mailto:garymiller@starband.net?Subject=Re:%20Computer%20Poker%20was%20RE:%20kasparov%20vs%20junior%20drawn">garymiller@starband.net</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; There is now, however, a financial incentive for creating better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs: internet casinos. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where's the financial incentive when the program can look at your cards,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the deck if it wants to and you'd be none the wiser.  Their biggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem is not winning but letting the suckers who play them win often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enogh to keep them coming back with more money!
</em><br>
<p>I'm not talking about the management of the casino itself: I'm talking
<br>
about bots acting as players in a reputable casino.  Although I do not
<br>
play online myself, there are indeed quite reputable places that go to
<br>
great pains to ensure fairness and honesty, mainly by implementing
<br>
total transparency: every hand played by all players is logged, and the
<br>
logs of cards shown are available to the public so that they can do
<br>
statistical analysis and evaluate individual plays.  If any player
<br>
raises suspicion about any particular play, the management has a log
<br>
of the cards not shown as well, and can easily investigate.  Cheaters
<br>
have been caught and barred, and real people such as Mike Caro and
<br>
Phil Hellmuth do put their personal and professional reputations on
<br>
the line to vouch for the integrity of the places they sponsor.
<br>
<p>Yes, it's possible that a casino could add cheating shills to game;
<br>
but it would be very difficult for them to get away with anything
<br>
obvious, or even less-than-obvious things for very long.  Poker
<br>
players have been dealing with cheats for years and know how to spot
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>I do not play online, but a number of my professional and semi-pro
<br>
friends do, and they have about the same earning rate as they do in
<br>
brick-and-mortar casinos, which is itself statistical evidence that
<br>
they are probably run fairly (of course they only play in one of the
<br>
three or four well-known reputable casios, not the random ones you
<br>
get spam ads for).
