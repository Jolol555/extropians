<p>
As those of you who know me personally will be aware, I've been in shock
<br>
all day.  Unfortunately, I have a trial Monday morning, so I've had to
<br>
work through my pain.  A few preliminary thoughts, though ...

<em>&gt; Subject: RE: shuttle breaks up on re-entry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Officials are warning anyone who finds fragments to stay well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear, due to `lethal toxic fumes' from unburned fuel. Well, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hmm, that sounds implausible. Is this just an attempt to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent looting/souveniring of the flight recorder etc? Might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have been carrying something nasty and undisclosable?
</em><br>
<p>No way.  There's a real reason for this, since the hypergolic fuel of
<br>
the thrusters and main OMS engines is nasty, nasty stuff.  But the truth
<br>
is that most, if not all of that will have burned up in the
<br>
disintegration of the bird.  I'm sure at least one of the large
<br>
secondary puffs of smoke one can see in the video is one of the OMS pods
<br>
cooking off.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, I think your first guess was right: Warnings like
<br>
this were the first idea that popped into the NASA PAOs to KEEP PEOPLE
<br>
AWAY from wreckage so it can be examined in pristine condition for
<br>
forensic purposes, and to cut down on pilfering.  The debris field is
<br>
over a hundred miles long, from what I heard driving home from the
<br>
office just now, and some of the people in that area are, to put it
<br>
mildly, not too bright.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Swifter abandonment of the Space Station?
</em><br>
<p>Not abandonment.  The institutional inertia behind ISS is immense.
<br>
Abandoning it now would mean basically killing NASA as it exists today.
<br>
For better or worse, ISS is the primary work of NASA now.  However, the
<br>
program will be modified.  IIRC, an irony is that Columbia was the least
<br>
capable of the Shuttle fleet because it was the heaviest.  I know some
<br>
of its refits over the years lightened it, though.  I do know it had the
<br>
lightest work load in the ISS schedule.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Winding down of the clunky shuttle program, finally?
</em><br>
<p>Again, not any time soon.  The inertia behind the shuttle system is hard
<br>
to comprehend for people who haven't seen all the pieces of the system
<br>
and the huge array of support systems developed for it.  But efforts to
<br>
replace the shuttle will perforce be strengthened.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; A military satellite detected a heat spike. What exploded on board?
</em><br>
<p>Way too early to tell, but the train of telemetry data indicates a
<br>
cascading failure in the left wing area, the same area impacted by what
<br>
looked like ice falling from the ET.  Heat spikes are consistent with
<br>
secondary combustion/explosion of the fuel on board, especially the OMS
<br>
pods.
<br>
<p>Many, perhaps most, of us on the list find the current status of the
<br>
manned space program to be wrong-headed.  But as extropians we can all
<br>
admire the courage and vision of the people who ride rockets into space.
<br>
Losing any of them is a special loss for us.  Gone are seven of the best
<br>
of the best.
<br>
<p>Sadly, from Space City, USA,
<br>
