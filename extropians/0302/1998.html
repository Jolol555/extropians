<p>Kai, a couple of comments.  We are getting (a).  The Honda Civic Hybrid
<br>
recently released follows the path of development vehicles such as
<br>
the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius.  Some news items predict that
<br>
Toyota will be selling all gas-electric hybrids by 2012.
<br>
<p>The trick will be getting people in the U.S. out of their SUV's and trucks.
<br>
<p>Oil (or esp. methane) *could* be both unlimited and sustainable *iff*
<br>
it were produced in solar ponds instead of pumped out of the ground.
<br>
That however requires a fair amount of bioengineering.  But it is *not*
<br>
unreasonable to expect that it could be accomplished within a decade
<br>
if enough resources were devoted to the problem.
<br>
<p>One cannot produce enough energy to meet an average individual's
<br>
transportation requirements from the surface area of ones home
<br>
*but* I suspect for less than the cost of a few years gasoline
<br>
consumption one could buy some significant fraction of an acre
<br>
in a sunny location and produce sufficient energy resources
<br>
(such as methane) that your effective energy costs are zero
<br>
(i.e. you pipe your methane into one end of the pipeline
<br>
system and take it out the other end).  The Europeans should
<br>
be buying land close to the ocean in North Africa.
