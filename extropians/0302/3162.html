<em>&gt; The Gallup International survey, released on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tuesday, found 68 per cent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Australians backed some sort of military action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against Iraq.
</em><br>
<p>Does anyone have numbers on approximately how many
<br>
polls, that would by nature have to take in a random
<br>
sampling of the populace...lets use the US here...are
<br>
done each day (average of course)?  And an average
<br>
number of those polled for each issue?  I find myself
<br>
curious that so many polls represent the American
<br>
attitude (they sure have enough come election time),
<br>
yet neither I, nor anyone I know well enough to hear
<br>
if they received a poll some day, have ever received
<br>
one.  I'm excluding favorite radio station phone
<br>
calls, since oddly almost everyone I know gets those
<br>
at some time.
<br>
<p>Perhaps if anyone on the list has received them, and
<br>
has anyone received many?  My initial thoughts are
<br>
that I'm not experiencing a statistical anomoly, but
<br>
that the polls seem to go to certain people more
<br>
consistently than others.  I'm not quite sure what the
<br>
standard is though.  Registered voters?  Well no,
<br>
everyone else in my family is one and most of my
<br>
friends as well.  Taxpayers or citizens is definetely
<br>
not it, since everyone I refer to is both.  Perhaps
<br>
the same lists telemarketers get?  But I receive a
<br>
number of calls each day as do my family members,
<br>
again.  So what is it?  Or is it just my imagination,
<br>
and it's statistically lower that I'd know anyone who
<br>
received one than I suspected?
