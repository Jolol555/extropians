<em>&gt; &gt; All of your references pertain to the US support of Contras against

<em>&gt; &gt; the Nicaraguan Revolution and was refusing to hold democratic

<em>&gt; &gt; it was obligated to do in its agreements with the OAS.

<em>&gt; As far as I, as a foreigner, understand Brett's question, he asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for at least _one_ incident, where the US government broke a treaty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He didn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask why or if this breach was justified. He only asked for a case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Subsection 7 of the final decision [1] shows a &quot;*clear* and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *unambiguous* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance of a treaty breach by the US [...] of the sort an impartial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and reasonable third party would recognize&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;[...] by the acts referred to in subparagraph (6) ['laying mines in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the internal or territorial waters of the Republic of Nicaragua 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the first months of 1984'] hereof the United States of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its obligations under Article XIX of the Treaty of Friendship, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Commerce and Navigation between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the United States of America and the Republic of Nicaragua signed at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Managua on 21 January 1956;&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This treaty was with the previous government, NOT with the Sandinista
<br>
government. Historically, when revolutions occur, the new nations are
<br>
not bound to treaties signed by the prior governments, nor can nations
<br>
that had treaties with the prior government be obligated to observe
<br>
such a treaty if it obligates the other nation to hospitable treatment
<br>
and aid to a government hostile to it's interests.
<br>
<p>For example, the US once had treaties with Czarist Russia, especially
<br>
with regard to American investments in Russian industry. After the
<br>
Bolsheviks took over and started infiltrating agents into the US, it
<br>
was no longer in our national security interest to observe treaties
<br>
signed with the Czarist state. Most european governments were in a
<br>
similar position in the same period.
<br>
<p>Because of these historical precedents, the decision of the
<br>
International Court is wrong and evidence of their communist bias.
