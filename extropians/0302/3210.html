This message was prompted by Ron's recent message (perhaps
<br>
for no reason other than circumstance), but may be useful
<br>
from a &quot;reputation&quot; analysis standpoint.
<br>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to sit down with Mez and
<br>
converse with him for a couple of hours on extropic topics.
<br>
I would simply like to urge people to take him and/or his
<br>
comments very very seriously.  I suspect his signal-to-noise
<br>
ratio is higher than most on the ExI list (including my own).
<br>
<p>On Thu, 20 Feb 2003 <a href="mailto:Dehede011@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Egypt%20(was:%20Bush%20budget%20has%200%20dollars%20for%20afghanistan)">Dehede011@aol.com</a> wrote:

<em>&gt; second only to Israel.
</em><br>
<p>Mez's points are very valid IMO -- the bottom line appears to be
<br>
that the U.S. bought Egypt.  We have &quot;bought&quot; them through several
<br>
decades and several political administrations.  Until we acknowledge
<br>
and/or resolve that situation it seems unlikely that a really
<br>
productive relationship may develop.
<br>
<p>It seems (to me) that the U.S. bought off a resolution to the 1967
<br>
and/or Yom Kippur wars and has been paying ever since.  The points
<br>
that Mez makes appear to be quite valid and open for debate
<br>
*what* are we getting *now* for our money?
<br>
<p>The thread of who made statements becomes somewhat complex at
<br>
this point, so please pardon any misquotes/attributions...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin suggested to you that you read the book by Hernando de
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soto, The Mystery of Capitalism.  I suggest you do so also.
</em><br>
<p>I have not had the opportunity to read TMoC.  Though I believe I
<br>
think and espouse many of the principles I would hope it promotes.
<br>
My impression of the position that Mez holds seems to *not* be
<br>
significantly different from mine or that I would expect to find
<br>
in TMoC.
<br>
<p>So the question of why one would be urging Mez to read TMoC
<br>
remains open.  A better question might be why in the hell is
<br>
the U.S. supporting an undemocratic regime Egypt to the tune
<br>
of 3+ billion dollars per year some 20 years after we bribed
<br>
our way into producing a peace seattlement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would like to start you down that road, to understanding the US,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with this thought -- can you believe we sort of stumbled into our success
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern and even today 98% of our people haven't got the foggiest idea what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was that we did (and are doing) that was right?
</em><br>
<p>Ah, this is a *key* insight.  And it is one that de Soto
<br>
or any other economist may not stumble across.
<br>
<p>While capitalism and/or libertarianism are key elements that
<br>
I know people on the ExI list will swear up and down are the
<br>
essential components they may neglect another critical component.
<br>
<p>By and large the U.S. population was self-selected!
<br>
Any economic/political discussion that leaves out the
<br>
genetic components of the U.S. population I will always
<br>
view as incomplete.  The same may be viewed of the
<br>
Australian population (though my understanding of what
<br>
fraction of self-selection may have taken place there
<br>
is much less certain).
<br>
<p>It is a fundamental question -- does one sacrifice
<br>
ones current security (limited as it may be) for
<br>
a completely unknown security in a foreign land?
<br>
<p>In response to the above point (98% of our people don't
<br>
know what we are doing right) I would like to suggest
<br>
that the ancestors of many/most Americans selected
<br>
to take the risk.  Americans are fundamentally a
<br>
&quot;risk taking&quot; population.  Those who are descended
<br>
from people who did not immigrate are in the
<br>
&quot;risk opposed&quot; population.
<br>
<p>And that may make all the difference with respect
<br>
the economic performance of a country.
<br>
<p>It might have little or nothing to do with the
<br>
academic structures that support capitalism and
<br>
might have a lot to do with the people who actually
<br>
implement it.
