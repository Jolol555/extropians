<em>&gt; &quot;The Big Bang theory supposes that at the instant of creation, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum singularity that became the universe would need to have infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; density and temperature.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Btw, many years ago somebody performed real experiments following
<br>
another idea. Unfortunately I've lost references and results. But, 
<br>
I suppose, many authors already performed similar experiments in their
<br>
s.f. books!
<br>
<p>Let us imagine it is possible to build a consistent model
<br>
of photons (and gravitons? why not?), with a &quot;retarded&quot; wave 
<br>
(from the past to the future) plus an &quot;advanced&quot; wave (from the 
<br>
future to the past). Ok it is the usual Feynman-Wheeler approach.
<br>
<p>But the &quot;advanced&quot; wave (we can imagine) needs the &quot;existence&quot; of 
<br>
a &quot;target&quot;. Because the photon comes into existence if there is a 
<br>
&quot;source&quot; (emitter of the retarded wave) and also a &quot;target&quot; (emitter 
<br>
of the advanced wave).
<br>
<p>I remember that John Bell, talking with Davies, told him that a
<br>
&quot;super-determinism&quot; would perhaps solve the business of QM (The Ghost 
<br>
in the Atom, page 47). Now the retarded + advanced waves model actually 
<br>
imposes a &quot;super-determinism&quot; on the universe.
<br>
<p>Now imagine there is a discrete and real &quot;target&quot; out there (hence
<br>
in a different time).
<br>
<p>In example, assume the earth is x years old. An emitter of the retarded
<br>
wave, far away from the earth, required (x light years ago) that the
<br>
forming earth (&quot;target&quot;) must emit the advanced wave backwards in time.
<br>
<p>A highly collimated laser radiating into the outer space, with
<br>
a very very small angle, could show some effect. Because if waves were
<br>
beamed, at various directions in the outer space, and some power
<br>
fluctuations in the transmitter were observed, it could mean that the
<br>
outer space is not uniform. That is to say that sometimes there are,
<br>
or there are not, out there, &quot;targets&quot; receiving retarded waves and 
<br>
emitting advanced waves. 
<br>
<p>Ok here we might find something similar to the Olbers' paradox! So,
<br>
better to stop here.
<br>
<p>Oh no, wait. Sometimes science &gt;&gt; fiction. I do not remember if
<br>
Greenberger or who else wrote that it is possible to write down 
<br>
a quantum state [I remember this state written on a blackboard]
<br>
in which (not just 2 but) 3 particles are entangled in a very 
<br>
peculiar way. This one. If particle 1 is found to have the spin 'up', 
<br>
then particles 2 and 3 are entangled. If particle 1 is found to have 
<br>
the spin 'down', the particle 2 and 3 get disentangled. Now let us 
<br>
put particle 1 in a remote (say space-like separated) region. 
<br>
Yet a 'chance' event, befalling particle 1, strongly influences 
<br>
the mutual relationship betwwen particles 2 and 3!
