<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;The Big Bang theory supposes that at the instant of creation, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quantum singularity that became the universe would need to have infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; density and temperature.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Let us examine the question from the point of view of topology.
<br>
Now (for those, excluding scerir, who don't know what I'm talking
<br>
about, an &quot;open&quot; interval (0,1) does not contain its endpoints, 0
<br>
and 1, while the closed interval [0,1] does).
<br>
<p>Our concepts of the early universe often involve extremely early
<br>
instants in the chronology of the universe, e.g., 10^-43 seconds
<br>
(the Planck time).  A number of our conceptual troubles, it seems
<br>
to me, arise from insisting that the point 0 be included in our
<br>
discussions.  Why not regard the instant of the big band itself,
<br>
0, as not existing?
<br>
<p>In other words, we think of the open &quot;segment&quot;, and, upon a proper
<br>
mapping, simply imagine the true time-equivalent to reach infinitely
<br>
far back &quot;towards&quot; zero.  So, we might speak of 10^-N seconds, for
<br>
all positive integers N, and never deal with the troublesome limit
<br>
point itself, where N takes on the dubious value of infinity.
<br>
Is this a common idea?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let us imagine it is possible to build a consistent model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of photons (and gravitons? why not?), with a &quot;retarded&quot; wave 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (from the past to the future) plus an &quot;advanced&quot; wave (from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future to the past). Ok it is the usual Feynman-Wheeler approach.
</em><br>
<p>I'm following.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the &quot;advanced&quot; wave (we can imagine) needs the &quot;existence&quot; of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;target&quot;. Because the photon comes into existence if there is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;source&quot; (emitter of the retarded wave) and also a &quot;target&quot; (emitter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the advanced wave).
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  I had always wondered about that.  After all,
<br>
when you study Special Relativity, you understand
<br>
that the from the photon's point of view---if we
<br>
may indulge ourselves---its emission and absorption
<br>
occur at the same time.  Thanks very much for this
<br>
explanation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I remember that John Bell, talking with Davies, told him that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;super-determinism&quot; would perhaps solve the business of QM (The Ghost 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the Atom, page 47). Now the retarded + advanced waves model actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imposes a &quot;super-determinism&quot; on the universe.
</em><br>
<p>Fascinating.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now imagine there is a discrete and real &quot;target&quot; out there (hence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a different time).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In example, assume the earth is x years old. An emitter of the retarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wave, far away from the earth, required (x light years ago) that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forming earth (&quot;target&quot;) must emit the advanced wave backwards in time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A highly collimated laser radiating into the outer space, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a very very small angle, could show some effect.
</em><br>
<p>Do you really think that it would?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because if waves were beamed, at various directions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in outer space, and some power fluctuations in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmitter were observed, it could mean that outer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space is not uniform.  That is to say that sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are, or there are not, out there, &quot;targets&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receiving retarded waves and emitting advanced waves. 
</em><br>
<p>Your explanation is wonderfully clear.  And so Tipler
<br>
and others may totally use this argument!  After all,
<br>
we think the universe to be accelerating in its
<br>
expansion, with sufficiently distant galaxies receding
<br>
from us faster than light.  (Not of course, actually
<br>
moving through their own space faster than light---
<br>
that would be impossible according to relativity.)
<br>
<p>So, the fact that all our photons appear to be eventually
<br>
collected can only mean that the universe ultimately
<br>
collapses.  Or does it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ok here we might find something similar to the Olbers'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradox! So, better to stop here.
</em><br>
<p>One man's paradox is another man's escape from prison!  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh no, wait. Sometimes science &gt;&gt; fiction. I do not remember if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Greenberger or who else wrote that it is possible to write down 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a quantum state [I remember this state written on a blackboard]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which (not just 2 but) 3 particles are entangled in a very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peculiar way. This one. If particle 1 is found to have the spin 'up', 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then particles 2 and 3 are entangled. If particle 1 is found to have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the spin 'down', the particle 2 and 3 get disentangled. Now let us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put particle 1 in a remote (say space-like separated) region. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet a 'chance' event, befalling particle 1, strongly influences 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mutual relationship between particles 2 and 3!
</em><br>
<p>I will have to dwell for a while on the implications of
<br>
what you are saying here.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
