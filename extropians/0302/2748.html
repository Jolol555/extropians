The following is from an earlier exchange on &quot;anti-war&quot; protestors.

<p>Samantha, I hear your voice.  I may not agree with your views but I do
<br>
support freedom of speech.  That some of those protesters have good
<br>
intentions is not the point I was trying to make.  The WWP folks are
<br>
professional agitators whose agenda is socialism at any price.  I keep
<br>
hearing complaints about the lack of freedoms and human rights.  The
<br>
least whiff of perceived &quot;police state&quot; actions by the DOJ is trumpeted
<br>
as signaling the downfall of the U.S. Constitution.  I don't see it.
<br>
<p>BTW, anti-war protesters in Bisbee, Arizona this weekend numbered 300.
<br>
Impressive for a population of 6,358 (1998).  Bisbee is the county seat for
<br>
Cochise County and has long since metamorphosed from a mining town to
<br>
an arts and tourism center.  The town has a fair population of aging
<br>
hippies and yuppies of various descriptions.
<br>
<p>No protesters in Sierra Vista, Arizona with a population of 38,068 (1998).
<br>
I must admit this statistic is slewed as our town is adjacent to Fort Huachuca.
<br>
Last week an additional 400 troops from the U.S. Army 11th Signal Brigade began
<br>
deploying to classified locations.

<p>You'll be hearing a lot about antiwar protests in the next few days, but
<br>
our lazy press probably will not exert itself overmuch to tell you about
<br>
the jolly organizers. This connects some interesting dots.

Delurking for a moment... Are anti-war protests in the US also anti-American,
then?And I'd differ on the Gore thing, too. Gore wouldn't neccessarily look for
any reason he could find to attack Saddam. He would more likely have attempted
to actually prosecute, or as GBII might say, persecute, a war on some actual
terrorists rather than invading an already broken and mostly contained nation.

     &lt;snip&gt;Anti-war protests are merely anti-American protests, under the
     anti-war figleaf.Had Al Gore achieved a plurality in the electoral
     collage, and become President; the world-wide protests against
     American actions would have still persisted, unabated.
