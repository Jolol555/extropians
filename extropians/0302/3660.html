<p>
While we're sharing letters, I thought I would offer this one for public 
<br>
consumption. I don't feel it necessary to comment on most of Mr. Kiesling's 
<br>
letter, as I feel &quot;a baggage of my upbringing to give back to my country&quot; 
<br>
stinks of pretentious noblesse oblige and speaks for itself. Except of course 
<br>
his last statement, which I feel that I must.
<br>
<p>&quot;I have confidence that our democratic process is ultimately 
<br>
self-correcting, and hope that in a small way I can contribute from 
<br>
outside to shaping policies that better serve the security and 
<br>
prosperity of the American people and the world we share.&quot;
<br>
<p>I find it laughable at best to make a comment of this sort when the question 
<br>
is Iraq, a people who most certainly DO NOT share in the prosperity and 
<br>
quality of life enjoyed by Americans.
<br>
<p>In closing, let me merely point out again the final legacy of our withdrawal 
<br>
from Indochina, a period that he merely describes as one of &quot;systematic 
<br>
manipulation of American opinion.&quot; That is a charge than can most certainly 
<br>
be filed against more than just our government during that era. On the 
<br>
morning of April 17, 1975, the last remnants of the US diplomatic presence in 
<br>
Cambodia bid a hasty retreat from that tortured land. John Gunther Dean, the 
<br>
US Ambassador, sent word to several high ranking Khmer Republic officials 
<br>
that the United States would escort them out of the country and offer them 
<br>
asylum. Here is Premier Sirik Matak's response:
<br>
<p><p>Dear Excellency and Friend
<br>
<p>I thank you sincerely for your letter and for your offer to transport me 
<br>
toward freedom. I cannot, alas, leave in such a cowardly fashion. As for you, 
<br>
and in particular your great country, I never believed for a moment that you 
<br>
would have this sentiment of abandoning a people which has chosen liberty. 
<br>
You have refused us your protection, and we can do nothing about it. 
<br>
<p>You leave and my wish is that you and your country will find happiness under 
<br>
this sky. But mark it well, that if I shall die here on the spot and in the 
<br>
country I love, it is too bad, because we are all born and must die one day. 
<br>
I have only committed this mistake of believing in you.
<br>
<p>Sisowath Sirik Matak
<br>
<p>Sirik Matak would be executed soon after the fall of the capital of Phnom 
<br>
Penh later that day. He was one of the first of roughly two million 
<br>
Cambodians to perish under the Pol Pot regime.
<br>
<p><p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
