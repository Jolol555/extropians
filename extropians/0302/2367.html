<p><em>&gt;        There is a political principle that says the more things you regulate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the more things you have to regulate.  In fact Hayek says that it is this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea that eventually leads all statists to a dictatorship.  The number of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things being regulated become so numerous and the changes required to keep up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so numerous that eventually a court or legislature becomes incapable of doing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the job.  Eventually the country arrives at a point it requires a man on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horseback to make all the decisions for everyone.  Of course the more he is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuck in one place making decisions the more he is out of touch so the worse 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his decisions get.
</em><br>
<p>Basically, yes.  But it appears from Mancur Olsen's &quot;Power and Prosperity,
<br>
Surviving Capitalists and Communist Dictatorships&quot;, that there *is* one
<br>
way for &quot;the man on horseback&quot; to know what is going on and how to control
<br>
it.  Stalin seems to have understood this, but not his successors.  (It's
<br>
difficult to say anything more after Hayek has spoken, but some are now
<br>
doing it!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        You could argue that the reason that Germany &amp; the Soviet fell was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because their leaders became progressively more and more out of touch until 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they fell of their own weight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        After the fall of the Soviet, questions were asked why our CIA was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised by the collapse.  The answer seems to be that the Soviet citizens 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were so afraid to fail, least they be punished, they never reported the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth.  We had spies inside the KGB and were totally fooled because we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought KGB numbers would be correct -- in the end even the KGB didn't know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what was going on.  &lt;G&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You have pinpointed the problems that arise in these situations,
<br>
but not the category.  It turns out that it is *collusion* among
<br>
the underlings and workers.  To satisfy their higher-ups, meet
<br>
quotas, and evade the system, they get to know each other and
<br>
establish trust.  This trust is *vital*, because otherwise it
<br>
would be easy for any of them to be denounced to the KGB or
<br>
whoever.
<br>
<p>But the trust takes years to grow, yet insidiously grow it does.
<br>
What Stalin would do is periodically kill everyone off in 
<br>
purges, thus upsetting the links that were growing.  Now
<br>
whether or not *psychologically* the Soviet Union or any
<br>
other country can tolerate that indefinitely is something
<br>
else.  But productivity did remain high during the Stalin
<br>
years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Ford Motor Company production supervisors told me that under McNamara 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he would tell them to do as they were told or he would replace them -- a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really tough guy.  According to the old timers they got to count any car 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming off the end of the production line and they dared not make their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quota.  As a result they were rolling cars off the end of the production line 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that weren't finished.  They would then finish building the car out in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parking lot.
</em><br>
<p>A perfect example.  Note that this could not occur unless the
<br>
workers trusted each other (and whoever was watching them) not
<br>
to tell McNamara.  What McNamara needed to do was purge the
<br>
workers periodically to destroy the trust that would otherwise
<br>
build up.
<br>
<p>Or.  Or, of course, adopt better, more humane, and ultimately
<br>
more profitable strategies.  I think.
<br>
<p>Hmm.  Right now, a ruthless tyrant at Ford or anywhere else will
<br>
get such bad PR that he cannot do this kind of thing.  But if PR
<br>
were not a factor, what then?  Could a ruthless tyrant like
<br>
McNamara be the optimal manager?  (After all, &quot;purges&quot; here are
<br>
relatively benign affairs.)
