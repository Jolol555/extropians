Spybot (not Spycop!) is an excellent free tool for removing lots of
<br>
malware, including keyloggers, from your PC.
<br>
See: <a href="http://spybot.eon.net.au/">http://spybot.eon.net.au/</a> for a full description and download.
<br>
You have to be slightly careful when using it, as you may not wish to
<br>
remove everything that it reports finding.
<br>
(I remove everything, but I'm paranoid about security!)
<br>
<p>PestPatrol comes very highly recommended. It is as good as Spycop, but
<br>
slightly cheaper.
<br>
January 7, 2003 - PestPatrol, Inc (www.pestpatrol.com), the leading
<br>
provider of tools to protect against spyware, adware, trojans and hacker
<br>
tools today announced the availability of PestPatrol Home Edition 4.1.
<br>
In addition to the recently introduced user interface update, the new
<br>
PestPatrol now offers CookiePatrolT for automated spyware cookie
<br>
blocking, including unknown spyware cookies, and KeyPatrolT, for generic
<br>
keylogger detection and removal. In addition to the newly incorporated
<br>
unknown pest detection, the significantly expanded database in this new
<br>
version detects and removes more than 60,000 known pests.
<br>
<p>PC Magazine's 10th Annual Ultimate Utility Guide awards PestPatrol five
<br>
stars, calling it the most mature product reviewed and praising the
<br>
easy-to-use interface and broad range of malware detection and removal.
<br>
<p>PestPatrol does detect ISPYNOW as well as many other pests.
<br>
<p>Spycop is also a best buy, but more expensive than PestPatrol.
<br>
<p><p>If your PC is properly protected (big if), then remote installation of
<br>
any software is not possible without your active cooperation (i.e. click
<br>
and run an executable). And even if it was installed, your firewall
<br>
should stop that program accessing the web unless you specifically give
<br>
it permission to do so.  If you click and run an executable, you could
<br>
be installing anything on your PC, overwriting files, wiping your hard
<br>
disk, anything .......
<br>
I emphasise that when you get an email it is not necessarily coming from
<br>
the friend whose name is at the top. Treat all emails with attachments
<br>
as you would an unexploded bomb.
<br>
<p>Some web sites that you browse using MS Internet Explorer can try to
<br>
install software on your PC (via ActiveX), but you can protect against
<br>
this by not using Explorer as your browser, or keeping it fully patched
<br>
and installing yet more security software.
<br>
<p>Security is a never-ending battle. Especially if you like to wander into
<br>
the nether regions of the net, you have to have your PC fully kitted up
<br>
with every defence you can think of.
<br>
<p>Best wishes, BillK
