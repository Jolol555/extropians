<p>I am reasonably certain I have seen papers strongly correlating
<br>
certain aspects of the brain architecture that may involve
<br>
intelligence (neurotransmitter levels, variants in receptor
<br>
polymorphisms, etc) with pathologies (e.g. depression, suicide,
<br>
etc).  Anders probably knows this literature much better than I.
<br>
<p>But the consequence is that using current brain architecture
<br>
we may be pressing up against the limits.
<br>
<p>Now, *if* we equate &quot;intelligence&quot; with &quot;OPS&quot; (a stretch,
<br>
but perhaps not too unreasonable) then my work on Matrioska
<br>
Brains, depending in part on Anders' work on Jupiter (Zeus)
<br>
and Dyson (Uranos) brains.  [We will ignore his Neutronium
<br>
(Chronos) brains, depending in part on I think some comments
<br>
by Moravec that go a bit over the edge into &quot;magic physics...],
<br>
though Anders isn't alone in his area as it has been explored
<br>
somewhat in work by Seth Lloyd and Michael Franks.]  (This
<br>
isn't a small body of work but can be worked through within
<br>
a couple of days -- refs provided on request if those below
<br>
are insufficient)
<br>
<p>All of this is well documented, see:
<br>
<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/</a>
<br>
and
<br>
<a href="http://www.jetpress.org/volume5/Brains2.pdf">http://www.jetpress.org/volume5/Brains2.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>The number I cite for a Matrioshka Brain is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;a trillion trillion human minds&quot;
<br>
<p>One is talking roughly 10^42 instructions per second
<br>
assuming the consumption of the entire solar power
<br>
output and the most efficient (projected) nanocomputational
<br>
capacity that Drexler has proposed.
<br>
<p>This isn't the hard limit as it would be for Matrioshka Brains
<br>
of typical solar system sizes.  Provided they can harvest
<br>
more material as they migrate through the galaxy, they can
<br>
possibly grow to several light years in size.  The additional
<br>
growth does have a property of diminishing returns beceause
<br>
it does impose increasing time delays on thought processes.
<br>
But it does have the property of increasing their aggregate
<br>
thought capacity (and therefore presumably, intelligence).
<br>
<p>Recent progress with configuration of FPGA's for specific
<br>
applications (and their availability for general purpose
<br>
computers) suggests that the general concept of &quot;intelligence&quot;
<br>
will need to be reexamined (see for example the Minsky/Loebner
<br>
debates over the last decade or so).
<br>
<p>I believe that I have previously proposed (perhaps on the list
<br>
itself) MBrains optimized to think about certain topics.  Such
<br>
entities would only have a specific-purpose &quot;intelligence&quot; (not
<br>
unlike &quot;Deep Blue&quot;) and a fully optimized version would bypass
<br>
the heat cooling requirements and essentially melt itself at
<br>
the precise time it computed the result it was designed for.
<br>
<p>Raises a very interesting question with regard to the Fermi
<br>
Paradox.  Is the reason that the universe seems empty is
<br>
because all &quot;intelligences&quot; are eliminated at the end of the
<br>
period of what they are invented to do?
