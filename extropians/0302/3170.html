From: Michael M. Butler [mailto:<a href="mailto:mmb@spies.com?Subject=RE:%20Not%20about%20IRAQ%20at%20all,%20was%20Re:%20Bush%20budget%20has%200%20dollars%20for%20Afghanistan">mmb@spies.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; A very significant stumbling block on the way to the kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amity which ought to be possible emerges when one looks at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the driving dynamic of places missing those qualities listed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the text I snipped out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Roughly, it reads as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;_Finally_ we can get those &lt;x&gt; bastards back.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I agree.  This has sabotaged peace again and again the world over.
<br>
<p>Still, while we can't prevent this, we can reduce its likelihood.
<br>
Rich people are less into this kind of revenge than poor people.
<br>
People in democracies with a police force and a strong respect for law
<br>
are less likely to engage in revenge than people in functional
<br>
anarchies or dictatorships.
<br>
<p>The desire for retribution is one of the reasons that, if the US goes
<br>
into Iraq, it needs to be prepared to stay there for a long time to
<br>
come to put that country back on its feet.
