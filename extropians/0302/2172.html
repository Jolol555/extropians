<em>&gt; In Praise of Roe v. Wade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee Daniel Crocker, January 22, 2003
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The United States Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been maligned by both sides of the abortion debate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout the 30 years since it was issued on January 22, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1973. It has been called a &quot;non-decision&quot;, a &quot;cop-out&quot;, &quot;political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weaseling&quot; and much worse. You've probably heard some of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those opinions recently.  Even though many lawyers will tell you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that in a civil case, a judgment that both sides complain about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is probably a good one, they nonetheless will call this decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;cowardly&quot; or &quot;muddled&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the facts are that the decision itself stands up remarkably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well to detailed analysis of the issues involved, and when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; add in all that we have learned about biology in the years since,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can even seem prescient.  I doubt that my words here will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuade any of those who are truly commited to either side 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this debate, but I believe I can at least show that the justices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really did know what they were doing, legally, morally, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biologically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, let's make it clear what they really decided, since there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is confusion even over this.  In a recent episode of ABC's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; series &quot;The Practice&quot;, for example, lawyer Eugene Young
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ridicules the decision as &quot;nine men in robes making a decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  for the rest of us&quot;. But Mr. Young's tirade is 180 degrees 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the truth.  The court did  not &quot;make the decision&quot; for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone; they did exactly the opposite:  they said that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Texas legislature, despite being a group even larger than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; court and directly elected by the people of that  state, cannot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the decision for every woman in Texas.  But the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision was a bit more complex than that.  They further 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divided pregnancy into trimesters, and said that different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules apply to each.  In the first, only the woman involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can decide for herself, and no legislature or court can interfere;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the second, the state can regulate to some degree; and in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the third, the state can step in and even ban abortion outright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it chooses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That three-part standard is what both sides complain about:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who believe that all abortion is wrong don't like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; court allowing women that choice even in the first trimester 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pregnancy, and those who favor absolute choice don't like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that the court let the state step in before birth at all. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both sides refuse to recognize any substantive difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between a first-trimester pregnancy and a third-trimester one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as far as fundamental rights are concerned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So let's look at the issues involved, starting at the end: birth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no question in our society that once a child has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; born, the umbilical cut and its lungs full of air, killing that child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is seen as a despicable crime.
</em><br>
<p>Actually there is *some* question. The likes of Peter Singer
<br>
have questioned whether a neo-nate should really be regarded
<br>
as the moral equivalent of an older child or adult. I like that he
<br>
*questions* this because all boundaries that are not arbitrary
<br>
or not of mere convenience can withstand such questioning and
<br>
&nbsp;remain in place with greater justification, whereas there are many
<br>
conventions that are merely arbitrary or historical artifacts that 
<br>
have outgrown their usefulness. Nonetheless, when Singer runs
<br>
this sort of argument many people, including him it seems, do 
<br>
have a pretty understandable negative gut reaction. Most of us
<br>
find it pretty distasteful when someone seems to be chiming in 
<br>
with a &quot;few good words about infanticide&quot;. In the end though it
<br>
seems to me that is must be healthier and more moral to consider
<br>
more of our social premises. Particularly those social premises
<br>
which we have in the areas effected by increasing knowledge
<br>
of biology and developmental processes. These are areas where
<br>
science hits us squarely where we live even if most folks in a
<br>
society don't or can't make the connection between what's 
<br>
discussed in labs in scientific jargon and what's going on with the
<br>
standard of health and wellbeing of themselves and their families.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  There have certainly been societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where that was not the case: infanticide was tolerated and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common in some cultures, but not here.  Our culture, unlike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many, even assigns gender to infants: we call them little boys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and little girls from the moment of their birth, while most cultures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only separate men and women after puberty, treating all children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as just  &quot;children&quot;.  Our attitudes are more in line with the facts. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The qualities that we admire, even revere, about people that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make us revile harming them are just as evident in an infant as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an adult: people think, and feel, and dream, and laugh, and love,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and want; infants do as well.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is more true than false but I understand that neo-nates 
<br>
enter the world with some significant brain development yet to 
<br>
be done. I think there may be physiological changes happening in
<br>
the brain up until around the age of three and this does have 
<br>
some impact on the sorts of mental processing that very young 
<br>
children are capable of. Specifically I think it is quite difficult to
<br>
form certain types of memory before around the age of three. 
<br>
Others on this list will know more about this than me. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Infant boys and infant girls have different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills and different personalities that can be observed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measured right from birth.
</em><br>
<p>I don't reckon personality could have the same meaning when
<br>
a neo-nate is the referent as opposes to say a five year old 
<br>
child because of the still-developing brain. Piaget outlines 
<br>
stages of development/learning that most children go through.
<br>
The actual stages still seem to hold true even though the rate
<br>
at which a particular child goes through them can vary.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  Infants may not be be able to express
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves as well as adults, but they clearly are /selves/,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking and feeling as whole people. 
</em><br>
<p>I think neo-nates still have to work out the boundaries of
<br>
their self. They flap arms and legs about for a while as if they
<br>
have yet to discover what it and is not part of them. Cognitively
<br>
there is much development going on in the early years. Young 
<br>
children seem to think out of sight is out of existence up until 
<br>
a certain stage. An object like a ball that rolls behind something
<br>
else and is out of sight seems to be regarded as no longer there
<br>
until the child learns that it is. I think this may be part of the
<br>
&quot;peek a boo&quot; games adults play with little kids. There's nothing 
<br>
'sacred' anymore ;-). Some psychologist or other will analyse
<br>
almost anything. (Aside: I hope its possible to live in and enjoy
<br>
the world even after analysing it or I am in big trouble. I am
<br>
also skimming across the surface of the truth here rather than
<br>
dipping deeply in. Sorry time constraints.) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the past people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asserted that infants didn't feel pain, or never remembered 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events from their infancy, but we now know these beliefs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false,
</em><br>
<p>On the remembering, I don't know it to always be false.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that infants do feel pain and joy much as adults do, and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adult lives are affected by events in infancy, and even by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences before their birth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The third-trimester rules of Roe acknowledge a simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological fact: that there is little fundamental difference in kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between a child just before and just after birth.  
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Hospitals are full of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infants born weeks early, and while they may need a bit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assistance from modern medical technology, we clearly think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them as &quot;people&quot; in every important legal and ethical sense,
</em><br>
<p>We do. And I'm glad we do. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are in a womb or an incubator doesn't much affect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluation: they have thoughts and feelings and experiences in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either case, and the thought of ending their lives bothers us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a person there, and it is reasonable for a state to step
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in and protect that person from harm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The picture at the beginning of pregnancy is very different. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begins with the event of conception, 
</em><br>
<p>Ah there is a possible trap here. Many of us in Western
<br>
countries heavily seeped in the traditions of Judeo/Christian
<br>
religions have picked up and conflate some of the terminology
<br>
of religion and we use it interchangeable with science.
<br>
Conception, as I understand it (I googles recently but not today)
<br>
is a religious phenomenon, fertilization is a scientific one. Often 
<br>
the general public use them interchangeably. Sometimes though
<br>
to do this may be to loose some valuably insights into the way 
<br>
&quot;society&quot; sees things the way it does. The Christian church which
<br>
is the source of the concept of conception is considerably older
<br>
than the cell theory. Christian churches did not and could not 
<br>
have moral positions on embryos, ovum, sperm etc until *after*
<br>
scientific inquiry and discovery put these phenomenon on the
<br>
sociological map as new physical realities. They did have notions
<br>
on conception especially immaculate conception and later they 
<br>
were into notions of reproduction involving the homonculus. (Little
<br>
people fully formed within the sperm).  But once they (scientific
<br>
explanations of embryos, sperm, eggs, fertilization etc) were 
<br>
there, religion adapted to the presence of the new reality and
<br>
incorporated them. And religion will keep on adapting and 
<br>
incorporating new scientific knowledge, but it also acts as a bit
<br>
of a retardant to the rapid acquisition of new knowledge 
<br>
because religion simplifies and caricaturises scientific 
<br>
knowledge for &quot;all too human&quot; non scientific purposes.  
<br>
<p>In Galileo's time considerable trouble might have been saved if
<br>
some characters had looked through the telescope to see for
<br>
themselves. Nowadays its the microscope that might be the
<br>
more clarifying and educating instrument if only some could be
<br>
encouraged to look.. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
I think it is worth watching out for some ramifications of the 
<br>
use of different words like conception and fertilization. Its
<br>
worth knowing which tradition of thought one is operating in.
<br>
Its also worth recognizing that it is scientific inquiry, experiment,
<br>
and research that has placed many of the biological facts that
<br>
both empower us and require new moral decisions of us,
<br>
in front of us. Religions are not big on doing scientific discovery
<br>
per se they are big on integrating scientific discoveries into a 
<br>
broader contextual framework. perhaps even a more human
<br>
framework and thereby telling folks what these discoveries
<br>
actually &quot;mean&quot;, but religions don't actually make the
<br>
discoveries which prompt the new sorts of moral questions..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; though &quot;event&quot; isn't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right word because even conception is a complicated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process in many stages that can be accomplished in many ways. 
</em><br>
<p>This is true both for conception (religious phenomenon) and 
<br>
fertilization (scientific phenomenon). The distinctions matter in
<br>
part because religious phenomenon are more debateable whereas
<br>
scientific phenomena are verified or falsified and incorporated into
<br>
other types of world views and can thereby become religious 
<br>
phenomena (or perhaps not) as well. Perhaps not, because I don't
<br>
think there is a Christian or Muslem position on quarks, liposomes
<br>
or mitochondria though recently &quot;the rights of mitochondria&quot; got a
<br>
bit of a run on this list. I'm still waiting to see the T-shirt &quot;if you
<br>
love your mitochondria set them free&quot;. Could make a buck with it
<br>
at the next Green rally. I just hope the royalties get back where
<br>
they belong. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment I'll concede the point.  Once the DNA from the egg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and sperm have combined, the newly-formed zygote then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begins to divide into two cells, four, eight, and so on.  At this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point there aren't yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any specialized cells: they're all stem cells, and will only take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on specialized roles as organs, nerves, and so on much later in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the process of development.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The process of development itself can take many turns.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of the time, in fact, the process results in nothing at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all: most conceptions are simply flushed out with the mother's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next menstruation, and never develop, and the woman never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knows that any conception occurred at all.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah looking at this (which is essentially true) I can understand
<br>
another reason why conception could get used. In developmental
<br>
biology or embryology there are a number of different terms
<br>
used to describe the &quot;conception&quot; at different stages. These terms
<br>
in some cases are only jargon. To further differentiate can simply
<br>
obscure the point that is being made. But *sometimes* by 
<br>
adopting non scientific terms to describe processes we lose a
<br>
large part of the clarity and discrimination that may be necessary
<br>
for making moral judgements within the grey zones. The way in
<br>
which complexity is simplified for general consumption can itself
<br>
be a political process. I am in favor of citizens in democracies
<br>
engaging in genuine moral debate but all too often what happens
<br>
is not a genuine moral debate but a competition by folks with
<br>
agendas to caricaturise complex issues into simpler bite size forms
<br>
so that the ordinary citizen voter is more likely to decide in favor
<br>
of the person who presents the &quot;prettiest&quot; caricature. We take 
<br>
this route to some extent when we get too fast and loose and 
<br>
falsely-economical with certain words. Extropes, perhaps more
<br>
than most, can get the words right, we do have the education
<br>
and the technology, and in getting them right and talking more
<br>
clearly within our local communities we can empower our local
<br>
communities to a better understanding of the actual moral issues
<br>
being debated as a result of new biological understanding and 
<br>
possibilities. Individual extropes that talk to other people in their
<br>
communities about what they think can empower others in their
<br>
community with the tools to get better involved in understanding
<br>
the real moral trade-offs rather than merely observing and choosing
<br>
between caricatures presented by priests, bioethcists, public
<br>
commentators, even stem cell lobbyists and patient advocates.
<br>
Its good for society if more voters understand what they are voting
<br>
on and a big part of the problem is that the jargon disenfranchises
<br>
voters from some of the most important policy decisions and laws
<br>
that are made which will effect their lives and the lives of their 
<br>
families. Extropes can help bridge the jargon-knowledge gap 
<br>
with an effectiveness in their local communities and the people they
<br>
talk too far beyond their mere one vote each.  Sorry soapboxing
<br>
over.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  In those fewer cases where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the zygote does make it through the tubes to implant in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uterus, its fate is still undetermined.  It might develop into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person, or two people, or three, or half.  Identical twins, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, result when the multi-celled zygote splits at some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point, and both portions go on to implant and develop into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully formed unique people (albeit with identical DNA).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Identical triplets are quite rare, but also possible.  Another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even rarer possibility is that two different zygotes will merge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at some point in their development, and develop into a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully-formed person with two sets of DNA.  These are called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tetragametic chimeras, and are often born with defects, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can also be born as perfectly normal infants who may never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that they were the product of two different conceptions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is where the &quot;life begins at conception&quot; argument falls 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down:
</em><br>
<p>(also true for fertilization)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; yes, a zygote after conception is living, in the same sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that any of our skin cells or liver cells is living. They can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divide and grow (indeed, we can now grow skin and muscle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tissue in vitro from a single cell), and contain a full set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic material.  But the legal question is not whether the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing is living or not, or even whether it is human.  The legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question is &quot;is it a person?&quot;, in the sense of laws that make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harming people an act of violence we detest, or is it merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a collection of cells like the skin cells we flush down the drain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when we wash our hands, or blood cells that we donate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Red Cross?  What is it about people that makes them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specially deserving of such protection?  A good way to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer that is to think of the twin case: why do we consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twins to be two people, not one?  It's simple: each twin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinks and feels and dreams independently.  Each has its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own personality and its own desires and fears.  It is untenable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to argue that the single zygote that would later develop into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these two people had any of those qualities: it has no brain, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no nerves, no eyes, no ears.  It had only the potential for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing those things--and we don't know  yet from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zygote stage exactly what it might develop into.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might become a person, or two, or half, or it might not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Likewise, there is nothing special about the type of cell that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the zygote.  We retain stem cells even into adulthood, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of them also has the potential to develop into any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of cell. The day is not far off--if it hasn't happened 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already--when a single cell from an adult human will be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to produce a cloned person, just as Dolly the sheep was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created from a cell of her mother. Clearly, it would be morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repugnant not to grant that person the same legal rights as other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, because she will have the same thoughts and feelings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as any other infant, despite the fact that she was not the product
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of conception at all. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, literally, a clone is statistically more likely to be a 
<br>
&quot;conception&quot; (someone's particular idea actuated) than the average 
<br>
neo-nate who may or may not have been &quot;planned&quot; and whose 
<br>
genetic make-up almost certainly wasn't so vigorously &quot;selected&quot;.
<br>
<p>Also when society affords person-like rights to non-persons it 
<br>
reduces its capacity to fully resource those rights it could or would
<br>
have liked to grant to persons. (Eg. There is a real trade off between
<br>
the rights we as society chose to allocate to an embryo such as a 
<br>
spare IVF embryo or an embryo created specifically to be used as 
<br>
a source of embryonic stem cells and the rights we allocate to sick
<br>
persons). Unfortunately (or otherwise) the real world is contingent. 
<br>
It requires that sometimes we (society) must make moral choices 
<br>
and balance trade offs and these choices necessarily have negative
<br>
consequences for some forms of human life, just as making no
<br>
choice also has consequences. Regardless of how people actually
<br>
decide to weight the various trade-offs its seems we should be able
<br>
to agree to at least look at the biological facts that inform a moral
<br>
decision. At present this doesn't really get to happen for most 
<br>
voters. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whether or not you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approve of cloning, the fact is that it demonstrates vividly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that the concept of one-conception-one-person doesn't fly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the first trimester rules of Roe also reflect what we know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about biology: a few cells don't make a person, and it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make sense to arbitrarily grant them the rights of a person when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't even yet know what they may develop into.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mother, on the other hand, is quite clearly a person, and her rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can and should be protected.  Laws against birth control, &quot;morning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after&quot; pills, and yes, even first-trimester abortion clearly do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victimize real women, and we simply can't legally or ethically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justify that to protect what is clearly not a person.
</em><br>
<p>If only we could teach children this distinction with their times 
<br>
tables and spelling. What makes a person a special entity not in
<br>
religious but in civil society. Or maybe the difference between life,
<br>
human life, human being and person would be better explained not
<br>
with the times tables but with some basic set theory. A simple book
<br>
on this theme would be pretty handy in the chambers of government
<br>
in the West right now. I wonder what sort of graffiti they might have
<br>
in the toilets. A few Venn diagrams would be good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lastly, there's the middle ground: the second trimester.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justices here make another wise statement: we don't know.  At 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this point in the development of what's now a fetus, it begins to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resemble a person.  Twins have already split, chimeras have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already joined, and it begins to develop a brain and eyes and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ears.  It might have the beginnings of something like thoughts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and feelings, or it might not--we just don't know.  And because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't know, the justices leave the issue for further debate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the people's representatives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, the justices in Roe weighed the legal and biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts before them, and reached the right decision, despite the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that they had to decide decades before some of the biology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mention above was known.  I for one find that remarkable and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worthy of praise.
</em><br>
<p>Me too. I'd not seen Roe vs. Wade presented like this. Thank you.
