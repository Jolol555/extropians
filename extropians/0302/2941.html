<p><em>    &gt;&gt;He had a massive army and after he swallowed
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;&gt;Kuwait he could have taken over Saudi Arabia in
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;&gt;just a few days if he wanted to and he certainly
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;&gt;wanted to, the only reason he didn't is fear of the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;&gt;USA, and if he knew the president was listening
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;&gt;to advise from you he would have no fear and
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;&gt;the world would be a sadder and more dangerous
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;&gt;place today.

<br>
<p><em>  &gt; The evidence of this massive army was doctored. Sorry if you are
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; not informed of this.
</em><br>
<p>100% certified grade A Baloney. The same huge army that conquered Kuwait
<br>
could have done the same thing to Saudi Arabia in a matter of days and
<br>
undoubtedly would have if not for the USA.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Let me get this straight.  Saddam is the ONLY leader who wants
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; WMD?  You must be kidding.
</em><br>
<p>No, you do not have that straight and no, I am not kidding. What I said was
<br>
&quot; Saddam is the only leader in the world who wants weapons of mass
<br>
destruction, invaded his neighbors twice, has a chance to control the
<br>
world's supply of oil and has actually used chemical weapons on his own
<br>
people and on others.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sorry about your reading comprehension problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We were fully behind the Iraq/Iran war if that is part of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are referring to.  We helped build up the military strength
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Iraq and encouraged them.
</em><br>
<p>I don't give a damn because it has no relevance regarding what the present
<br>
policy should be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We have used chemical weapons and  have conducted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experiements on our own citizens.  Does this mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we should be invaded?
</em><br>
<p>I don't give a damn because nobody is able to do so.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;We would like to control the world's  supply of oil.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;Should we be invaded?
</em><br>
<p>I don't give a damn because nobody is able to do so.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;The supposed gassing of  the Kurds is actually under
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;some contention as it was during the  Iraq/Iran war
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;and the actual gas used judging from the examination
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;of the victims appeared to more likely be of the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;type employed by Iran.
</em><br>
<p>I'm curious, does being a apologist for a butcher like Saddam ever make you
<br>
uncomfortable?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Frankly, I find the US position and intentions in this matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoroughly sickening and utterly reprehensible.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. We've all heard you say that many many times, but I don't recall one
<br>
word of criticism about Iraq, I guess you think it's a clear cut case of
<br>
good verses evil. If so then I'm on the side of evil and proud of it.
