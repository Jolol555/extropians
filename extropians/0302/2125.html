Matt had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Government spending is a (very big) issue that is separate from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue of how best to raise the money to run government. Would you be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better or worse off if your oil heating bill increased by $200 next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; winter AND you also got an additional $200 in your tax rebate check?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is the question I am asking.
</em><br>
<p>and Rafal replies
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### For me the answer would be easy - I'll take the tax rebate, and use it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to upgrade my furnace. Next year I would still get the tax rebate, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heating bill would be no longer 200$ higher.
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't this miss the point of the question?  The idea is that you
<br>
are financially no better off---the effects precisely cancel each
<br>
other.  Therefore, if it would be wise for you to invest in upgrading
<br>
your furnace, it would also be if you had simply had to pay the same
<br>
the other way.
<br>
<p>I consider Matt's question perplexing.  I infer that Matt expects the
<br>
government to get the $200 from the oil producers by placing a tariff
<br>
on oil.  I don't see how this directly relates to his earlier scheme:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i.    Tax oil *at the barrel* (i.e. not at the pump)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ii.   Prices of oil based products; fuel, plastics, etc. naturally rise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iii.  Alternatives to oil based products appear a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       little cheaper. I.e. wood or metal instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       of plastic, bicycling instead of driving etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iv.   Some consumption shifts away from oil to alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; v.    Demand for oil decreases slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vi.   To maintain revenues oil producers drop prices a little (*)
</em><br>
<p>That is, if everyone were to obtain such a rebate from the government,
<br>
then no part of his scheme would actually be placed into operation;
<br>
though everyone would pay more for oil, it would be exactly canceled
<br>
by the rebate.  So instead, where he must be going is that the $200
<br>
is not *directly* related---rather it is some general dividend from
<br>
the government that would *not* depend on how much oil you used.
<br>
<p>All right, so trying to follow what would transpire, his steps (ii)
<br>
and (iii) kick in.  People would start to use less oil, encouraging
<br>
the processes of (iii) and (iv).  But hold it!  Once less oil is
<br>
consumed, the revenue from the tariff falls, and so does the (in
<br>
effect) $200 per capita rebate.
<br>
<p>I'm just guessing, but it still seems like people are getting their
<br>
ends accomplished in a more expensive way.  That is, oil is cheaper
<br>
that the alternatives, and what the scheme does is to make it *appear*
<br>
more expensive.  No matter how you slice it, it seems that the society
<br>
gets less mileage for its buck.
<br>
<p>To use the argumentum ad absurdum (or in this case, perhaps a better
<br>
phrase would be &quot;taking the argument to an extreme) to illustrate,
<br>
the government could place such a high tariff on the oil that
<br>
practically none of it was purchased.  Then the whole society
<br>
just has to make due with more costly substitutes, lowering the
<br>
whole standard of living.  This whole discussion may be nothing
<br>
more than an illustration of TANSTAAFL.
