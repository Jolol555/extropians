Kai reported:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Regarding &quot;democracy&quot;: I just found an article in the german online 
<br>
magazine Telepolis[1] about an anti-war demonstration in New York on 
<br>
Saturday. They say the police built barricades, hindered demonstrants to 
<br>
reach the place of the event, beat up people and used almost every 
<br>
non-democratic way to keep this demonstration small. Nevertheless, First 
<br>
to Fifth Avenue were crowded with people. Seems that slowly, slowly, the 
<br>
US authorities really drift from &quot;freedom and democracy&quot; towards banana 
<br>
republic.

<br>
<p>Rather than defend the US against your allegations, or the allegations of the 
<br>
article you have cited, let us try a different tack. There are T-shirts sold 
<br>
in Deutschland, asking; &quot;What Will We Do About the US?.&quot; Let us assume that 
<br>
the accusations of barbarism or whatever, are factual. What will the world do 
<br>
about it? 
<br>
<p>This is a good question given the fact that so many wish, and wished, to do 
<br>
nothing against the Islamic Militants, North Korea, the Balkans massacres, 
<br>
the Rwanda massacres, Mao's China, Pol Pots Kampuchea, Idi Amin,the old 
<br>
Soviets, the Japanese Imperialists, the National Socialists, Mussolini's 
<br>
smashing of the Ethiopians, etc., ad naseum.
<br>
<p>So basically, I am inquiring, how are we US fascist exploiters to be 
<br>
punished, to be corrected, so we can be forced to conform to the &quot;proper&quot; way 
<br>
of thinking? The Russians had an expression called Kto Kogo, which means 
<br>
&quot;who, whom?&quot; It asks the question; who can do what, to whom? Perhaps a 
<br>
disinvestment in US companies, the closing of embassy's, a military assault? 
<br>
I am pretty confident that protests and rallies, however persistent, and 
<br>
televised will not suffice to change American policy against our poor 
<br>
victims, so...?
<br>
<p>Yours in Cthulu,
<br>
