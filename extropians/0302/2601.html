<p><em>&gt; The classic reason for parallel universes to be depressing is because

</em><br>
<p>I think this depressing line of thinking can be traced to a false
<br>
definition of identity, the same false definition against which I railed
<br>
so vociferously (and probably to no avail) with fellows like Corbin and
<br>
Rafal a couple of months ago.
<br>
<p>As I see it, those other instances of &quot;you&quot; in alternate MWI universes
<br>
are not actually you in any meaningful (non-nominal) way, so their
<br>
decisions and activities should be of no concern to you for purposes of
<br>
asking questions about your possible free will or lack of it. Those
<br>
alternates of you are you only in *nominal* ways: they look like you and
<br>
carry identification cards that look similar to yours. Otherwise they
<br>
are not you in any meaningful *non-nominal* way. 
<br>
<p>They are &quot;you&quot; nominally, i.e., they are qualitatively you in the same
<br>
way that all people named &quot;Emyln&quot; are you. I'm sure you'll agree it
<br>
would be a nonsensical to expand your idea of self to include all people
<br>
named &quot;Emyln.&quot; I maintain that we make the same mistake when we try to
<br>
expand our identities to include alternate versions of ourselves in
<br>
alternate MWI universes. The temptation to do so is greater only because
<br>
those alternates share much more than our simple names: many of them
<br>
share duplicates or near duplicates of our families and of our homes and
<br>
friends, etc, but these duplicated elements are objectively no different
<br>
than the duplications of our nominal names. In *non-nominal ways* each
<br>
of our alternates are entirely different from one another, each with his
<br>
own personal experience of living.
<br>
<p>As evidence of this, consider a thought experiment in which one of those
<br>
other instances of you were to, by some miracle of physics, suddenly
<br>
appear in this (your) universe. You could, if you so desired, kill that
<br>
alternate instance of yourself and then go on living as though he had
<br>
never existed. Granted it might be a crime and it might be emotionally
<br>
distressing to see an alternative of oneself be killed, but in essence
<br>
your life would continue normally. If the murder took place at someone
<br>
else's hand, without your knowledge, then you would be none the wiser
<br>
for it. That murdered instance of &quot;you&quot; cannot therefore rightly be
<br>
considered to have been you. 
<br>
<p>However we may ultimately decide to define human self-identity, surely
<br>
the capacity to experience one's own individual existence is a necessary
<br>
prerequisite. So then, if I terminate the existence of entity A without
<br>
entity B's knowledge, and if B then continues without noticing a
<br>
difference in his life due to the termination of A, then surely entity A
<br>
is not entity B! For this reason our alternates in alternate universes
<br>
should by no means be considered ourselves. If they cannot be considered
<br>
ourselves then their existence can have no bearing on questions of our
<br>
free will.
