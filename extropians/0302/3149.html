<p>Australia the most pro-war: poll
<br>
Tuesday 4 February 2003, 14:05PM
<br>
<p><p>Australia is the country most in favour of military action against Iraq,
<br>
an international poll of 39 countries has found.
<br>
<p>The Gallup International survey, released on Tuesday, found 68 per cent
<br>
of Australians backed some sort of military action against Iraq.
<br>
<p>However, 56 per cent were in favour only if the United Nations supported
<br>
it, while just 12 per cent of Australians supported unilateral action by
<br>
the United States and its allies.
<br>
<p>Some 27 per cent of Australian respondents said they would not support
<br>
war under any circumstances - five per cent didn't know.
<br>
<p>In Australia, levels of support for war outstripped even the US, where
<br>
the poll showed 67 per cent supported some type of military action.
<br>
[image]&quot;);document.write(&quot;  advertisement&quot;); } } // --&gt; 
<br>
<p>However, 33 per cent of Americans supported unilateral action, and 34
<br>
per cent backing action if it was UN-sanctioned.
<br>
<p>Some 21 per cent of Americans said they would not support war under any
<br>
circumstances and 12 per cent didn't know.
<br>
<p>Public opinion is split in Britain, where the Blair administration has
<br>
lined up with Australia to support the US in its military build-up in
<br>
the Middle East.
<br>
<p>While 39 per cent of Britons were in favour of UN-backed military action
<br>
against Iraq and another 10 per cent supported unilateral action, 41 per
<br>
cent were opposed to military action under any circumstances, and 10 per
<br>
cent didn't know.
<br>
<p>The poll also found the vast majority of people in most countries
<br>
thought war was likely to break out in the next few months.
<br>
<p>Some 89 per cent of Australians expected an imminent war with Iraq, and
<br>
53 per cent said Australia should support the war if it breaks out.
<br>
<p>In the US, 73 per cent of people would support their country's
<br>
involvement in conflict with Iraq.
<br>
<p>The poll also revealed that most people in more than two-thirds of the
<br>
countries surveyed, including 51 per cent in Australia, think US foreign
<br>
policy has a negative effect on their nation.
<br>
<p>In Australia, the survey was conducted by Roy Morgan late last month.
