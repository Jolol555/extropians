<em>&gt; &quot;Iran, 1953: When the government of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nationalized the Anglo-Iranian oil company, the resulting sanctions on      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the country &amp;#8211; led by Great Britain and the United States &amp;#8211;      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulted in                                                                 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic hardship and political unrest. Fearing that such instability       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could result in a communist takeover and concerned about the precedent      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of nationalization on American oil companies elsewhere in the Middle        
</em><br>
<em>&gt; East, agents of the Central Intelligence Agency organized a military        
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coup in 1953, ousting the elected prime minister. The United States         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; returned the exiled Shah to Iran, where he ruled with an iron fist for      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than a quarter century. Tens of thousands of dissidents were           
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortured and murdered by his dreaded SAVAK secret police, organized and     
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trained by the United States. The repression was largely successful in      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiping out the democratic opposition. The SAVAK was less successful in      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infiltrating religious institutions, however, so when the revolution        
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finally took place, toppling the Shah in 1979, the formerly secular Iran    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came under the leadership of virulently reactionary and anti-American       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islamists. The result of the Islamic revolution was not only the end of     
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of America&amp;#8217;s strongest economic and strategic relationships in

<em>&gt; the                                                                         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Middle East, but also the hostage crisis of 1979-81, Iranian support for    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-American terrorist groups, and a series of armed engagements in the    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Persian Gulf during the 1980s. Had the United States not overthrown         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iran&amp;#8217;s constitutional government in 1953 and replaced it with the     
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictatorial Shah, there would not have been the Islamic Revolution and

<em>&gt; its bloody aftermath.&quot;                                                      
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I am appreciative of your response, Sean, but I disagree completely  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with it.                                                                    
</em><br>
<p>To which Samantha responded:
<br>
<p>&quot;According to people I know who escaped from Iran, it is quite                
<br>
accurate.&quot;                                                                    
<br>
<p>With all due respect, all of the people I've met from the former South Vietnam
<br>
describe the Communist regime as a horrible, nightmarish one and applaud our
<br>
efforts in Indochina, something you seem unwilling to accept. Therefore, I
<br>
suggest that we refrain from using personal acquaintences from a given country
<br>
as experts in the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we wish to continue the rotating game of                                 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assigning blame, then I could then say this.                                
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Do you think that is all or even primarily what this is?&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, in terms of the way the dialogue was progressing, I do. I believe that
<br>
Mez, Sean, and I all made points in our posts worth elaborating on, something
<br>
I did with Mez. But the discourse as presented in this thread originally
<br>
lacked any historical perspective and was more directed toward assigning blame
<br>
and criticism.
<br>
<p>&quot;To me it looks more like attempting to honestly understand what              
<br>
happened.  It may not be the whole story but it is one important              
<br>
slice of the story.&quot;                                                          
<br>
<p>As I pointed out in my subsequent reply, and you seem to ignore, I don't
<br>
feel that Sean's description as presented helped anyone honestly understand
<br>
what happened. In his post, he does not address the Soviet Union's actions
<br>
in Iran, the region, or the world once when describing the period of the
<br>
Shah's rule. You cannot seriously consider US foreign policy abroad without
<br>
doing so. He merely illustrates ONLY the negatives of the Pahlavi regime,
<br>
which serves only to give the reader a negative opinion of the United States
<br>
efforts abroad with none of the perspective required to make an informed
<br>
judgment. Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's flaws are a part of the story, but they are
<br>
nowhere near the most important part of the story.
<br>
<p>&quot;If it is excluded out of discomfort or disagreement with other takes then    
<br>
our understanding is poorer and we are less likely to reach conclusions and   
<br>
take actions                                                                  
<br>
that are actually helpful toward our deepest goals.&quot;                          
<br>
<p>Again, considering that not only did I point out the Shah's repression in my
<br>
rebuttal post, but also illustrated examples by South Korea's Syngman Rhee
<br>
and other US proxies, I do not see where your point about it being excluded
<br>
comes in. I would argue then that Sean is more guilty of this, since he at no
<br>
point illustrates the positive aspects of the Shah's regime. If one is truly
<br>
interested in deeper understanding of an issue, then one should welcome the
<br>
study of both the good and bad of any given issue. Failing to do so in my
<br>
mind merely allows one to remain stuck in the mold of whatever ideology they
<br>
subscribe to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Had not Islamic fanatics of                                                 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the terrorist organization Fedaiyan-e Islam (Devotees of Islam)             
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assassinated then Iranian Prime Minister Ali Razmara in 1951, Mohammed      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mossadegh would never have been appointed Prime Minister in Iran (by the    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shah, who you heavily criticize, a point I will address shortly).           
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Razmara staunchly opposed nationalization of the oil companies on the       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounds that Iran should abide by its international agreements and          
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because he felt they could not run the oil fields alone.                    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Does this though deny the other side or add aspects and                      
<br>
dimensions to the unfolding story?&quot;                                           
<br>
<p>Yes, I believe it does, given that it illustrates that not all Iranian
<br>
political thought was united on the course of action subsequently taken by
<br>
Mossadegh. Moreover, it also illustrates the role Islamic fundamentalists were
<br>
playing in the destabilization of the Iranian domestic political situation
<br>
some thirty years before the Iranian revolution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        A continued Razmara administration then would not have nationalized  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the oil fields, the sanctions you speak of would never have occurred,       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a pro-western regime endorsed by the Western powers would have been     
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continually aided and supported Iran for the foreseeable future. Therefore, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not only are the Islamic fundamentalists to blame for the chaos in Iran in  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1978-79, they are also to blame for the difficulties which occurred in the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1950's.                                                                     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;This seems rather silly doesn't it?  You are claiming one                    
<br>
assassination is responsible for everything?&quot;                                 
<br>
<p>No more so than Sean is claiming the US instigated coup against the Mossadegh
<br>
regime subsequently prevented Iran from achieving democracy and that the US is
<br>
therefore responsible for everything which subsequently happened.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Let me say now that I am partly to blame for this game of &quot;Who did   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what&quot; oneupsmanship. In responding to Mez originally, as is seen above, I   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responded more forcefully than perhaps what was appropriate. I took strong  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue with his apparent claims that US foreign policy during the Cold War   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was somehow intentionally anti-democracy. In my subsequent discussions with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mez we were able to clarify and elaborate on our positions. Though I did    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not agree completely with him, I found him to be a fair, thoughtful, and    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent poster. But, given my initial reaction, I am not surprised that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sean replied in the manner in which he did.                                 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;It is well known that we have often acted intentionally anti-democracy in
<br>
several countries in the world.  It is pointless and unhelpful to deny this.&quot;
<br>
<p>I find your characterization of US decisions completely unfair. As I pointed
<br>
out at length to Mez, and as Lee Corbin eloquently stated recently, the choice
<br>
abroad for the United States during the Cold War era was not one between
<br>
democracy and authoritarianism. It was a choice between authoritarianism
<br>
and far worse. Democracies did not just spontaneously appear and thrive
<br>
during the world of the 1950s and 1960s. To illustrate what I mean, all one
<br>
need do is study the histories of the African nations Ghana, the Gambia,
<br>
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Libya, the Central
<br>
African Republic, and Uganda, (among many others) to see examples of where
<br>
democracy was hoist upon a country and it was swallowed up by military coup
<br>
d'etat. Most of these nations were outside the interest/touch of Cold War
<br>
geopolitics. Democracy was a process that evolved and took several centuries
<br>
to take hold in the West. To expect it to magically take hold and thrive
<br>
overnight in nations with dissimilar political traditions is folly. Is it
<br>
not more logical to subscribe to Lee Corbin's excellent point that these
<br>
nations in many cases are not the ideal hosts for overnight democracy? Or
<br>
shall people instead cling to the nonsensical argument that the US is at
<br>
fault for democracy failing to be spread abroad? The United States has done
<br>
more to further the spread of democracy and freedom than any other nation
<br>
in the world. To attempt to deny this fact is pointless, unhelpful, and
<br>
intellectually dishonest.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;        Having addressed the hyperbole on both sides, I would like now       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to address my main concern with Sean's post. As I commented to Mez, I       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot abide judgments passed on US foreign policy that make it appear      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these decisions were being made in a vacuum. To &quot;describe&quot; the US-Iranian   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship during the Cold War without once mentioning the Soviet Union,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Sean does, is to simply ignore reality.                                  
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Do you then believe the Cold War justifies real terrorism                    
<br>
against societies and governments around the world?  That the                 
<br>
end, slowing, halting and rolling back Soviet expansion,                      
<br>
justified any and all means?  If so, then why would you have                  
<br>
trouble admitting just how vile some of the means were?&quot;                      
<br>
<p>Again, at one point do I not fully acknowledge and catalog the sometimes
<br>
unfortunate means that were required to combat Soviet expansionism? But I will
<br>
not subscribe, as you seem to be doing, that there existed an option for the
<br>
United States that involved sitting back and doing nothing that somehow would
<br>
have delivered us a world which was more pro-freedom and democratic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I find it even more unfortunate that he did not in his rebuttal address my   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point, which was that the abdication of the Shah played a direct role in     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. It is simply not realistic to    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggest otherwise. The transformation of Iran from a pro-western nation      
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with US bases to a nation completely hostile to it had a profound impact on  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Soviet thinking. All one need do is look at a map of the region.             
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                                                             
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I think your point is rather minor in this fuller context presented, don't
<br>
you?&quot;
<br>
<p>How is my point, that involved a lessening in the quality of life for both
<br>
the Iranian and Afghani people, not to mention the Soviet troops fighting
<br>
to conquer Afghanistan, &quot;rather minor&quot; and somehow not a &quot;fuller context&quot;
<br>
than that of a limited description of the domestic situation in Iran? I must
<br>
honestly admit that I believe you are the one guilty of not acknowledging the
<br>
&quot;fuller context&quot; in this instance.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Another serious issue I have with Sean's post is his characterization of    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the regime of the Shah of Iran. In his post Sean succinctly points out      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the methods of repression used by the Shah, methods which would lead to     
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the imprisonment (and in many cases deaths) of thousands of Iranians        
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during his 25 year regime. This was the dark side of the Pahlavi regime,    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and something that should be rightfully pointed out.                        
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Good.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, Sean in no                                                         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way gives any sort of historical context to his analysis. What third        
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world regime of this era did not utilize these tactics?                     
</em><br>
<p>&quot;But how many of them were proped up so strongly by the US?&quot;
<br>
<p>To answer your question directly, Samantha, the answer is not the majority
<br>
of them. Again, Samantha, whether you wish to admit it or not, the question
<br>
for the US was one of choosing between authoritarianism and something worse,
<br>
not between democracy and authoritarianism. Let us now take the example of
<br>
South Korea. In 1950, the United States had the option of choosing between
<br>
Syngman Rhee, an authoritarian thug, or allowing that nation to fall into
<br>
the totalitarian hands of the Communist Kim Il Sung. The United States
<br>
chose to support the authoritarian Rhee. Today, the people of South Korea
<br>
enjoy a quality of life better than most nations of the world, including
<br>
their neighbors to the North, who are starving and remain backward and as
<br>
anti-extropian as they come. Now, are you seriously going to suggest that
<br>
because the United States supported an antidemocratic regime in South Korea,
<br>
that the subsequent gains made by the people there are somehow tainted?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Anwar Sadat, a man whose courage to deal with the Israelis is something I    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;greatly admire, was certainly guilty of this kind of repression. Syngman     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rhee executed 2000 suspected Communists in South Korea without trial in the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;early 1950's. Certainly no regime in the Communist camp could plead innocent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to this barbarism. In illustrating that other regimes operated in the same   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way, I do not seek to excuse or justify the Shah's repression. I merely      
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean to make clear that to pretend or ignore that others didn't is at best   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ridiculous.                                                                  
</em><br>
<p>&quot;How is this even relevant?  That other monsters existed did not              
<br>
make the Shah, who we supported, any less monstrous.&quot;                         
<br>
<p>It is relevant because Sean's characterization of the Shah was one that
<br>
suggested he did nothing positive for the people of Iran. More importantly,
<br>
it suggests in his view that no regime that engaged in that sort of behavior
<br>
could be supported by the United States. Ninety percent of the regimes in
<br>
the world during this era actively participated in repression of dissent, so
<br>
it would've been impossible for the United States to contain communism, let
<br>
alone conduct any sort of foreign policy if this standard was used as the
<br>
basis for interaction with other nations. To hold the regimes of this era to
<br>
the standard of the contemporary United States is absurd, and illustrates a
<br>
profound lack of understanding for 20th century world affairs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To allow unfettered dissent in such                                         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a time was to show weakness and vulnerability and sow the seeds of one's    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own demise, as the Shah would learn a quarter century later. This was       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the unfortunate reality of this era.                                        
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Would you support the US deciding this is the reality and using              
<br>
such means on its own citizens?  The legal instruments that                   
<br>
would eventually allow it are being forged even as we discuss                 
<br>
this.&quot;                                                                        
<br>
<p>I initially thought I would not address a point as hyperbolic as this,
<br>
but I feel it must be addressed. It is obvious that you are not a fan of
<br>
the current US administration, but I think you do the quality of debate a
<br>
great disservice when you recycle old Vietnam era arguments that the United
<br>
States is in the process of becoming a garrison state. The United States
<br>
is doing less to silence dissenting voices in times of war than it ever
<br>
has before. During World War I, German-Americans were persecuted, and the
<br>
socialist candidate for president, Eugene Debs, was thrown in prison for
<br>
making anti-war statements. 120,000 Japanese nationals were imprisoned in the
<br>
&quot;internment&quot; camps of World War II. 6000 draft resisters were prosecuted in
<br>
the US during that same war. Democracy has grown stronger, not weaker in this
<br>
country since then. The government chose not to prosecute for treason any of
<br>
those US citizens who had offered &quot;aid and comfort&quot; in North Vietnam, a direct
<br>
contrast to each of our prior military engagements. If you wish to debate the
<br>
merit of our past decisions abroad, fine, but let us not become entangled in
<br>
fanciful discussions on the impending doom of democracy in the United States.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The majority of nations in the                                              
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world were not democracies during the 20th Century. A large portion of      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the blame for this can be placed on the Soviet Union, which attempted to    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foster a climate of the exact opposite system of government throughout      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the globe. To somehow blame repression, or worse a lack of democracy, on    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the United States is absurd, as it somehow suggests that the world would    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have had more democracies had the US chosen a policy of inaction and        
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less influence.                                                             
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                                                             
</em><br>
<p>&quot;When we support and prop up governments making them much less                
<br>
likely to be subject to change by their people, we act                        
<br>
anti-democractically and act to repress those who would change                
<br>
their country toward greater democracy.&quot;                                      
<br>
<p>Your argument does not stand up to historical scrutiny. South Korea, Greece,
<br>
and the Philippines, for example, all had regimes supported for a decade or
<br>
more by the United States that were not democratic, and yet each country
<br>
managed to achieve democracy through their own internal efforts. This was not
<br>
the case anywhere in the Communist world during the ascendancy of the Soviet
<br>
Union. Had we not &quot;propped up&quot; the authoritarian regime of Syngman Rhee in
<br>
South Korea, then there would be no democracy in that nation today. You seem
<br>
to be suggesting that the United States was the main culprit in preventing
<br>
democracy abroad, when it is readily apparent that it was the most positive
<br>
force for its spread, directly or indirectly, that the world has ever seen.
<br>
<p>&quot;Influcence and action                                                        
<br>
that increases what we do not want and gets little of what we do              
<br>
want is not very wise action or influence.  Historically we must              
<br>
understand what we actually did and its unintended consequences.&quot;             
<br>
<p>These actions achieved what we did want, the containment and eventual end
<br>
of expansionist Communism. In many cases, it provided the opportunity for
<br>
democracy to thrive where it would not have otherwise. (South Korea, Taiwan,
<br>
etc.) In simply focusing upon the failings of the regimes the US supported,
<br>
you fail to paint a clear picture of what positives were achieved, both abroad
<br>
an in terms of the quality of life for the peoples of the nations in question.

<p><p><em>&gt;        He was also determined that his people become a literate one. The    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literary rate in Iran in 1977 was 85%. Today, it is only 72%, with Iraq at  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 58% and Egypt at 51%. Primary school attendance rose from 270,000 in 1960   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to over 10 million in 1977.

<p>&quot;The Shah did some great things, sure.  So did the Soviet Union.  But that    
<br>
doesn't mean we did not also err greatly in our                               
<br>
support for him when we did not do more to stop his very                      
<br>
negative and anti-democratic aspects.&quot;                                        
<br>
<p>And allowing him to fall has somehow bettered the lives of the Iranian
<br>
people? I dare say the fall of the Soviet Union has bettered the lives of
<br>
Eastern Europeans among others, even though you suggest that regime &quot;also
<br>
did great things.&quot; This has simply not been the case in Iran. All of the
<br>
achievements which I mentioned regarding the Shah's have seen reversals in
<br>
present day Iran. He had many faults, as I have readily acknowledged. But he
<br>
also brought a better quality of life to his people than that enjoyed by most
<br>
of the people in the Middle East even today.
