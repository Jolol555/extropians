nuclear technologies can be easily subverted for weapon production. 
<br>
<p>Rafal,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem to remember that in the late 60s Herman Kahn wrote a book 
<br>
called The Next Two Hundred Years.  As I recall he predicted a particular 
<br>
peak population of about 15 to 25 billion in the year 2176 AD.  He also 
<br>
assumed the per capita use of energy would continue growing at the same rate 
<br>
as it has in modern America and would spread to the rest of the world's 
<br>
population on the same basis.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then made various predictions as to whether or not the Earth could 
<br>
be made to produce the necessary amount of food and other where withal 
<br>
without resort to resources from space.  As I recall he felt that the Earth 
<br>
could sustain us.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I remember distinctly that when he looked at the availability 
<br>
of nuclear material he calculated that energy from nuclear sources was 
<br>
entirely too limited to become much more than a secondary source of energy.  
<br>
I seem to remember that he thought nuclear energy was just a passing thing.  
<br>
The ore supply isn't there as far as he could tell at that time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am getting into this discussion late but has Kahn's viewpoint been 
<br>
discussed?  BTW, I looked on Amazon.com and his book is still available on 
<br>
the 2nd hand market.
