<p>
Somebody fire the script writer please.  This drama is not playing
<br>
out the way it should.  We were told there would be a war now.  Or
<br>
armed conflict, military intervention, whatever.  You know, pretty
<br>
Top Gun-style pictures of military machinery, explosions, the good
<br>
stuff from the movies.  This was hyped as the TV event of the season,
<br>
but so far it has been a big letdown.  The audience is disappointed.
<br>
All that anticipation has been build up, but there's no war in
<br>
sight.  Not only has the climax been delayed, it may never happen
<br>
at all.  Lousy script that.
<br>
<p>In case you lack the proper perspective:  For all of us, this war
<br>
thing is nothing but a TV event.  If you consider the global
<br>
population, in a first order approximation nobody is involved.
<br>
Certainly we in the First World aren't.  I guess some Iraqis will
<br>
be killed, and Al Jazeera will provide us with some gruesome pictures
<br>
(part of any good TV show, of course), but these are strange people
<br>
in faraway places nobody would otherwise care about at all.  It
<br>
will be their ten minutes of fame, they should be thankful for that.
<br>
Okay, so there will be some US and British soldiers involved.  But
<br>
hey, those are paid professionals who joined the military in order
<br>
to go to foreign places and kill people there.  With some luck,
<br>
they may be able to do just that.
<br>
<p>It's only pictures in the tube.  Really.
<br>
