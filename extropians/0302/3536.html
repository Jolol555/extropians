<br>
truly shameful time in our history
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, once an old Indian Chief told the whites at a treaty conference.  
<br>
&quot;You have made us many promises -- more than there are leaves on the trees.  
<br>
But only one promise have you kept.  You promised to take our land and you 
<br>
have took it.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in addition there were the laws you had that discriminated against 
<br>
us.  Missouri had laws for many years that an Indian was not allowed to 
<br>
reside within the state.  Other states had similar laws.  Many states had 
<br>
laws that we could not testify against a white man in court.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Cherokee often had extremely good farms.  If a white man wanted our 
<br>
land he took it.  If we killed him we were murderers, if we went to court we 
<br>
could not testify against him.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even this is not the greatest harm that was done.  Today in many 
<br>
places an Indian will only recognize someone as Indian if that 2nd person has 
<br>
a paper from the white government saying they are Indian.  For me that is the 
<br>
sign of a society that has completely cracked from pressure.
