<br>
<p>I think Kai is saying that by driving, you are polluting, polluting which
<br>
can kill people.  By driving under the influence, you an also kill people.
<br>
That appears to be the correlation you are drawing.  Of course, one could
<br>
draw that argument to the logical extreme and say that by existing you are
<br>
killing people (demanding resources that pollute the environment, etc.)  One
<br>
must draw a line of reasonability somewhere, Kai appears to draw a more
<br>
conservative one on this point at least.  
<br>
<p>This is the same guy, however, who thinks the possibility of a nuclear
<br>
reactor killing millions is worse than the 3 million people who die every
<br>
year from the pollutants from the combustion of fossil fuels.  I can only
<br>
surmise that he feels lots of death spread out geographically and over time
<br>
is less bad then lots of death confined geographically and by time.
