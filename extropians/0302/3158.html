Mike Lorrey:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Every left wing nutjob that gets wasted helping the Iraqis commit war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crimes will be doing their part to reducing the erosion of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrity of the republic by removing their corrosive presence from our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body politic... I promise to nominate anyone who goes to Iraq for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose for posthumous Darwin Awards. You are certainly worth the effort.
</em><br>
<p>Sure the human shield idea is ridiculous and there ARE a bunch of lunatics
<br>
in the peace movement.But you can't do away with lots of millions of
<br>
*normal*
<br>
people demonstrating against the war last weekend. People like Tim May and
<br>
the human shield supporters are an extremely insignificant voice within this
<br>
group.
<br>
<p>You falcons do not seem to realize that the US will be an aggressor no
<br>
matter
<br>
how terrible Sadam is. It is against international law to invade a country
<br>
under the given circumstances. And the way the Bush administration
<br>
disregards the objections of the rest of the world is unbearable. Don't you
<br>
see, that the US is internationally isolated , not Germany or France.
<br>
<p>The true war criminals will be Bush and Rumsfeld when the rally is over.
<br>
People will be shot in the head, their limbs will be torn apart, their guts
<br>
will fall out. Desert Storm One: approximately 300.000 Iraqis dead. No true
<br>
democratic nation can get away with this kind of aggression. I sincerely
<br>
hope that Bush and Rumsfeld and their submissive ally states will be dragged
<br>
in front of the Hague tribunal and be punished and thrown in prison. But no:
<br>
Bush will be reelected and the murderers receive an enthusiastic parade on
<br>
their return home.
<br>
<p>Now THAT is really sickening to know
<br>
