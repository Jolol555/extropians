</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this does not mean that there is no self. It only means that we are a

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, the well-known split brain experiments, and other recent discoveries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell us that we are not quite who we think we are.  So how far might this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extend...?
</em><br>
<p>I talk about this in an old essay &quot;The Dissolution of Identity&quot;,
<br>
<a href="http://www.leecorbin.com/dissolu.html">http://www.leecorbin.com/dissolu.html</a> , which still accurately
<br>
conveys my worries about that.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Changes are part of being alive. We are running the program so to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; speak.  If we did not change we would be in a state of death.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; living is changing.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with what Max literally writes, but perhaps not with
<br>
what he means.  An old argument on this forum is the degree
<br>
to which one can be said to be living if one is in a loop,
<br>
say, experiencing the same year over and over again exactly.
<br>
I consider that to be quite alive, thank you, and if I get
<br>
my way, someday I'll have versions of myself running which
<br>
do nothing but re-experience 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and
<br>
so on.  (If CPU time is cheap enough, of course.)  If there
<br>
is an objective physics time pointer, and the value of that
<br>
pointer is (at the instant I am typing this) 2262 AD, then
<br>
I am indeed glad that a future me has succeeded in having
<br>
2003 run again!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think we are referring to two different things here.  I agree with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that living implies changing.  I was saying people conventionally think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of themselves as having some essentially continuous or unchanging aspect,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and suggesting that this too is suspect and will have low value to us as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we advance beyond our evolutionary bonds.
</em><br>
<p>But some of our aspects, like our beloved old memories are
<br>
unchanging, or as nearly so as we can manage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You have yet to prove that the self is illusionary!  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theory goes against both common sense and observations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I say it's illusory because it's not what it appears.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not arguing that self is not a useful concept.  I'm sure that a sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self has been essential to survival at the most fundamental level.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful organism must distinguish between Inside and Outside in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight and defend.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm suggesting that the conventional concept of self is due for upgrading as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we move beyond evolutionary constraints.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think that you and Max are converging here, and I do
<br>
agree with you.  Except that while I indeed hope my self
<br>
evolves---perhaps in the direction you indicate---that should
<br>
not have to occur at the expense of my backup versions running
<br>
the old selves.
<br>
<p>And it is for sure that one of the primary motives for wishing
<br>
that lives be saved is that the selves who inhabit those lives
<br>
are real and ought to persist and prevail.
