<p>What Would Satan Drive?
<br>
<p>America, they say, has come to despise SUVs. We hit the road to find out 
<br>
just how much.

<p>FORTUNE
<br>
<p>Tuesday, February 4, 2003
<br>
By Brian O'Reilly
<br>
<p>We are driving down the New Jersey Turnpike, waiting for the cellphone 
<br>
to ring. Normally we'd hope that the damn thing never made a sound. But 
<br>
today we are plumbing the depths of resentment that Americans bear 
<br>
toward those polluting, car-crushing, un-Christian, Osama-funding road 
<br>
monsters known as SUVs. Our vehicle is a canary-yellow, three-ton, 6 
<br>
1/2-foot-high Hummer H2, with tires that look as if they came from an 
<br>
earthmover. On the rear is our phone number and a big sign inviting 
<br>
motorists to call.
<br>
<p>Oh, it sounded like a great assignment at first. &quot;I want you to do 
<br>
something with a Hummer,&quot; said the editor. I assumed it was an update of 
<br>
a story I'd done years ago about the testosterone-enriching off-road 
<br>
capabilities of the original Humvee, splashing across streams and 
<br>
creeping over boulders. Later my editor's intent became clear: Cruise 
<br>
the suburbs and the urbs, highways and bird sanctuaries, attracting and 
<br>
chronicling anti-SUV sentiment. Thanks, chief.
<br>
<p>But today something's amiss. On the turnpike our fellow New Jerseyans 
<br>
are uncharacteristically restrained. We press on and park the Hummer at 
<br>
a rest stop on I-95 in Maryland. From a table inside, son Paul and I 
<br>
watch for someone in the parking lot to spew venom at the truck. Is the 
<br>
thing invisible? Later, as we rumble through Washington, D.C., nary a 
<br>
catcall, brickbat, or middle finger greets us.
<br>
<p>We arrive at our destination: a Baptist church near downtown Washington, 
<br>
the ministry of Rev. Jim Ball. He is the guy who dreamed up the &quot;What 
<br>
would Jesus drive?&quot; campaign that has seemed to stir up a storm of 
<br>
Hummer hatred. His campaign distilled a free-floating hostility toward 
<br>
the giant sport utes that now account for about a fifth of all cars sold 
<br>
in the U.S. Pranksters slap stickers on SUVs' rear bumpers with the 
<br>
mocking message I'm Changing the Environment. Ask Me How. A television 
<br>
ad campaign argues that SUVs' thirst for gasoline is funding terrorists. 
<br>
Surely Rev. Ball will shake a wrathful fist at us.
<br>
<p>&quot;Wow. That really is a truck,&quot; he says, eyeing with amusement the way it 
<br>
towers over everything else in the parking lot. He explains gently that 
<br>
his campaign was a natural extension of the question evangelical types 
<br>
commonly ask--&quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; If we go to war with Iraq in part 
<br>
because of our huge demand for foreign oil, Ball says, well, that 
<br>
wouldn't be right, would it? We stare at our feet.
<br>
<p>Ironically, Ball has gotten more heat from fellow evangelists about WWJD 
<br>
than we got cruising 500 miles (at 10 1/2 per gallon) in a Hummer. 
<br>
Televangelist Pat Robertson accused him of blasphemy. Rev. Jerry Falwell 
<br>
told Ball on a talk show that he wished he owned a Hummer. On the phone, 
<br>
a Falwell spokesman told us that the minister believes Jesus would have 
<br>
driven a Hummer too. We decided Falwell needed a ride in a Hummer, so we 
<br>
started off for his church in Virginia. But God had other plans: He hit 
<br>
northern Virginia with an ice storm, thwarting our exegesis of His taste 
<br>
in automobiles.
<br>
<p>So we headed north to Atlantic City, figuring sinners might explain what 
<br>
the godly could not. On the way we spotted a remote wetlands 
<br>
environmental center--surely a hotbed of big-car antipathy. Anxious 
<br>
about our reception, we briefly drove the Hummer down what turned out to 
<br>
be a delicate footpath through the center's bird sanctuary. An elderly 
<br>
worker emerged from a building and pointed us in the proper direction. 
<br>
&quot;Boy, you need tires like that on a day like this,&quot; she said admiringly.
<br>
<p>In Atlantic City we spotted another Hummer parked near some casinos and 
<br>
waited for the owner to show up and tell us what it's like to be a 
<br>
pariah. He turned out to be a Danny DeVito-esque fellow named David 
<br>
Branderbit, owner of a local copier-repair business. He squinted and 
<br>
thought hard for a moment when asked if he'd been affected by the &quot;What 
<br>
would Jesus drive?&quot; campaign. &quot;I think I heard about that,&quot; he said 
<br>
dubiously. Does he get any crap from strangers about what he drives? 
<br>
Branderbit gestured at his Hummer as though the answer were obvious. 
<br>
&quot;They wouldn't dare.&quot;
<br>
<p>We came to a startling conclusion: Nobody gives a damn what you drive. 
<br>
&nbsp;From New Hampshire to California, the answers from Hummer owners were 
<br>
the same. &quot;The only negative comment I ever got was 'That's the ugliest 
<br>
thing I've ever seen,'&quot; says Kelley McNally, a petite San Francisco woman.
<br>
<p>Far from being defensive, a surprisingly large number of Hummer owners 
<br>
viewed their oversized, go-anywhere vehicles as helping them make the 
<br>
planet a tad better. Susan Andersen uses her Hummer to save giant 
<br>
Neapolitan mastiff dogs from being euthanized. The dogs can grow so big 
<br>
and unruly that their owners take them to be destroyed. Andersen once 
<br>
drove 25 hours from her home in Manhattan to Canada to transport a 
<br>
condemned mastiff to a new owner. &quot;I was driving through three feet of 
<br>
snow. Nothing else would get me through.&quot;
<br>
<p>Other Hummer owners say that their travels through the forest keep fire 
<br>
roads open or that they can help rescue stranded hikers and motorists. 
<br>
In Pennsylvania a Hummer owner who calls himself Biker Bill doesn't 
<br>
worry what Jesus thinks. Because his Hummer seats only five, he bought a 
<br>
Suburban, too, to collect his adult children and drive them to church on 
<br>
Sundays. &quot;They had a habit of saying they'd meet us there. They didn't 
<br>
always make it.&quot;
<br>
<p>So where does all the anti-SUV rhetoric come from? &quot;It comes from you 
<br>
guys back there on the East Coast,&quot; says Michael Lawler, a founder of 
<br>
the Hummer Club in Los Angeles. &quot;We love big trucks out here.&quot; Biker 
<br>
Bill says, &quot;It's a West Coast thing. Back here, we leave each other alone.&quot;
<br>
<p>There was time left for one last attempt to flush out the anti-SUV 
<br>
crowd. My son and I roared along the beach in Brigantine, N.J., up 
<br>
(legally) into a huge wildlife preserve. Aha! A woman was watching the 
<br>
birds. She spotted us. She raised her hand! This was it!
<br>
<p>Alas, she waved. She smiled.
