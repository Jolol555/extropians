<em>&gt; &gt; If take a look at the behavior of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complex system with multiple feedback
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; loops, you might feel that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; amazingly responsive to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment, but you won't necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; find any one-to-one mapping or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; representation of the outside world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; within the system being examined.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could try to build it that way, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wouldn't be efficient, and at the lowest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level the mapping wouldn't hold true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, this is one point of view.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are many intelligent people that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree with this.  But it is my opinion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this view is wrong and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applicable to us.  We have very rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious representations that map very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closely to the reality we are aware of.
</em><br>
<p>That's one possibility, and I'll admit, the
<br>
most likely one.  Jef's theoretical point
<br>
is still valid, IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Everything we know is not the object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself, but our conscious representation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it.  It is my opinion that accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representations are the most efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at being intelligent in versatile and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creative ways.  If an intelligent being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knows something, there is something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is part of him that is that knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>Suppose I wonder whether there is such a
<br>
representation of my monitor---on which
<br>
I'm reading email---in my brain.  It turns
<br>
out that there is.  In our visual cortex
<br>
(I forget whether it's V4 or what), there
<br>
indeed is such a literal mapping:
<br>
<p>Monkeys eyes were held fixed while they
<br>
steadily looked at a certain geometric
<br>
figure (a grid or a triangle, I forget).
<br>
Then they were instantly killed, and it
<br>
was found that this same grid was
<br>
present, and spatially too, in their
<br>
visual cortex (at the back of their heads).
<br>
So it seems that we do have a picture in
<br>
our heads for visual information.
<br>
