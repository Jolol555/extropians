<p>I don't know Dian, but Terry is a longtime and valued subscriber to 
<br>
Politech. NASA still has Dian's bio online, which says she was a 
<br>
propellant engineer:

<br>
<p>Also, while it may be just a coincidence, remember that Columbia 
<br>
carried Israel's first astronaut and came as tensions in the Middle 
<br>
East are growing:

Subj: re: Challenger - Fw: I  F-ING WARNED THEM.
From: <a href="mailto:terry.s@juno.com?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20[forteana]%20Politech%20on%20Columbia%20disaster">terry.s@juno.com</a>
Dian is a naturist friend in Florida.  She's one of the first two women
in the country to have gone through US Marine EOD, Explosive Ordnance
Disposal school.  She also has some stories about being subjected to a
made-for-TV arrest in the time since being fired by NASA for allegedly
threatening a politician, a misuse of felony law a la &quot;Homeland Security&quot;
trying to silence her political outspoken attitude and frequent directed
criticism newspaper letters to editors.   --  Terry
====
Two years ago, I was a highly decorated NASA engineer.  I was awarded
their highest medal, for Exceptional Achievement -- something that is usually
reserved for senior managers -- because of my expertise.
I was a safety engineer.
I was removed from my GS-13 position, as an internationally-recognized
authority on hypergolic propellants and explosives, and forced off the
Kennedy Space Center.  At gunpoint.
Their excuse was that I had &quot;abused government equipment.&quot;  Because I
sent a friend an e-mail joke.
The reality was that I wouldn't play their &quot;political ball.&quot;
I F-ING WARNED THEM.
I told them that the technicians and engineers were overworked.  I told
them that there were too many managers and too many meetings and
&quot;dog-and-pony&quot;
shows.  I told them that their senior &quot;face time&quot; play games, while they
spent all their time plotting how to give each other pay raises, and left
the guys on the floor to struggle day to day with obsolete and overpriced and
unqualified equipment, was going to result in another Challenger.
I was there for Challenger.
I saw the same exact conditions happening again.  Overpaid, lazy,
irresponsible managers concerned solely with their climbing up their
ladders.
I told them they were skimping on inspections.  I told them that the
ground  crews were asleep on their feet from exhaustion.  I made as 
much noise as I  knew how to make about the top-heavy bureaucracy 
sitting around in their
fancy panelled offices, giving whorish press interviews in their
smugness, while they did not have a clue what was going on in the 
real world where I was working.
They fired me.  They fired a GS-13 civil servant, with an Exceptional
Service medal and ten dozen commendations.  For sending an e-mail joke.
In reality, for objecting to political fat-cats sitting on their fat rear
ends and failing to do their jobs.
Like Challenger, those who are most guilty are the ones who will attempt
to make the most political capital out of it.  But the blame for Columbia
lies entirely and totally with the NASA administrators.  They should all be
investigated for their criminal negligence.  They should all serve time
in jail.
I warned them.  They did their best to destroy me, because I warned them.
It's too bad that innocent astronauts paid with their lives for NASA
managers greed and political ass-kissing.
But I am not surprised.
Two years ago, I warned them.
