<p>Competition between groups, particularly given WoMD, will prevent every
<br>
speck of matter from being used.  Civilizations have continual internal
<br>
struggles for power which can become very dramatic with increasing size
<br>
and complexity.  The existence of geometrically replicating von Neumann
<br>
probes would only increase the possibilities for military tension
<br>
between competitors.  Why would any group willingly give up resources to
<br>
competitors which might overwhelm you with geometric replication.
<br>
<p>If it became apparent that nano-technology was taking over a planet,
<br>
denying those resources to my human group, it would be time to unleash
<br>
round the clock H-bombs until the nano-technology was stopped.
<br>
<p>Why is it assumed that consuming every speck of matter for computational
<br>
purposes is an optimal situation?  Any given individual within this
<br>
scenario would be better off if unused resources were readily available
<br>
rather than having to displace a competitor already controlling every
<br>
speck of matter.
<br>
<p>With WoMD [geometric destruction] and geometric replication [von Neumann
<br>
probes/biological systems] it is not obvious that there will ever be any
<br>
situation where everything is used up.  It is my considered opinion that
<br>
the cost function of destruction is much cheaper than that of
<br>
replication.  That is the primary reason for the stability of the
<br>
stealth, nomadic, decentralized civilizations.  Dispersal increases the
<br>
cost function of WoMD to the point that a steady state of
<br>
replication/destruction is created.  The sparseness of this steady state
<br>
will be directly related to the technology available and physical first
<br>
principles limiting WoMD and information technology.  Since information
<br>
exposes you to WoMD I expect very, very sparse dispersals will be
<br>
required in the long run.  Communication will need to be nearly
<br>
impossible to distinguish from white noise.  Leave little evidence of
<br>
your passing and pass through quickly.  von Neumann probes would find
<br>
their greatest use in pre-positioning supplies which only you are able
<br>
to locate easily.  Your von Neumann probes will have to quietly hunt
<br>
other von Neumann probes or be exposed themselves.
