<em>&gt;Very interesting analysis from Mick Hume at the excellent Spiked-Online:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;<a href="http://www.spiked-online.co.uk/Articles/00000006DC61.htm">http://www.spiked-online.co.uk/Articles/00000006DC61.htm</a>
</em><br>
(from the article)
<br>
<em>&gt;&quot;In an age of political passivity, why were so many moved to march on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issue? It seems unlikely to be solely out of concern for the Iraqi people.
</em><br>
[Š]
<br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;The two biggest factors motivating Saturday's marchers were the growing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  atmosphere of mistrust towards government institutions, and the pervasive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  culture of fear and risk aversion.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I think that writer presents a narrow and odd view, Fabio. The shadow
<br>
sides of humans encompass many aspects of ourselves, not only fear, although
<br>
fear is a very large driver. Those shadow parts of us are stories that
<br>
ultimately provide us with the most energy  because they are the
<br>
denied parts of ourselves, the most unknown. The shadow parts are also
<br>
the darkness that we cannot escape and is the most difficult to
<br>
contact because we abhor and disdain those parts. When one can openly
<br>
admit that those parts exist, or even that they _might_ exist, then a
<br>
door is opened. The control it has over you might not be as great, but
<br>
it is a large source of energy and knowledge nonetheless to use to
<br>
channel and transform in other parts of your life. You see there is a
<br>
positive side to the shadow.
<br>
<p>One of my favorite books and writers (Deena Metzger: _Writing for your
<br>
Life_) talks about one way to tap into the shadow. She says:
<br>
<p>&quot;Imagine that a mad person is someone who has a story to tell that
<br>
cannot be told, that each one of us has a story inside of us that we
<br>
have not been able to tell, that there is a mad or maddened person
<br>
inside each of us. Find this voice. Write whatever comes to mind.
<br>
Begin with whatever odd words come up from this voice, which you may
<br>
never have contacted before. Go down into the dark place to find this
<br>
creature, the one with the denied vision, the one who has been
<br>
inarticulate for so long. This mad voice must be heard. Let the
<br>
creature speak.&quot;
<br>
<p>Back to that article about the marches. I'm not sure that the
<br>
unconscious fear is one reason for the large turnout but I do believe
<br>
that fear is one of the main reasons (unconsciously or consciously)
<br>
that a large number of people want governments to help them run their
<br>
lives. It's too overwhelming and frightening for many to think that each
<br>
of us can know how to make the right decisions to live a good life, so one
<br>
turns that task over to a larger entity, not thinking carefully enough
<br>
if that entity is any smarter than each of us are. I think that if a
<br>
government disappeared miraculously tomorrow, people would quickly put
<br>
another one in its place because the fear of how to run our own lives
<br>
can be too large.
<br>
<p>The governments of today are thriving on this fear- it has the same
<br>
feedback loop in place that Anders talked about some days ago with the
<br>
media. To some extent, the governments' existence and power are the
<br>
result of people's own fears. Then the very structure of the
<br>
government can easily amplify those fears, and so we have the paranoia
<br>
multiplying exponentially.
<br>
<p>People who have lived under totalitarian and paranoid governments know
<br>
what it is like and should be able to tell others who have not lived
<br>
under such a government what is the end result. Is that happening? I am
<br>
not sure, but I don't think so. There are a lot of closed ears now to
<br>
hear it, and there are a lot of people who simply forgot their own
<br>
history.
