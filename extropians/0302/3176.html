</em><br>
<p>Yes.  The inimitable Charles Heston, of course.  But also
<br>
Bruce Willis and the Kevin Arnold of &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;.
<br>
Actually, few can be named, because conservatives dare
<br>
not speak up, or they get black-listed real fast.
<br>
<p>&lt;Spoilers for SimOne --- which I intend to view
<br>
tomorrow night --- elided ;-) &gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why did all the right wingers end up on the radio?
</em><br>
<p>Originally?  Because they had a Message that wasn't getting
<br>
out.  Rush and the others usually don't have guests, but
<br>
just articulate the logic of their positions over and over.
<br>
(And, of course, sometimes the illogic, like on abortion---
<br>
though it's interesting that this is seldom discussed!)
<br>
<p>Up until 1988, I had been waiting twenty-five years for some
<br>
mass media personality to carefully articulate conservative
<br>
positions.  It was practically unbelievable when it happened.
<br>
So there was an enormous market out there, which had been
<br>
somehow cordoned off by the journalism schools and the tight
<br>
cliques that control broadcast television.
<br>
<p>But it's no longer just radio.  There are one or two cable
<br>
TV channels that are either conservative, or balanced (it's
<br>
always hard to tell---the only thing that's easy to see
<br>
is that they're not uniformly laying out the usual liberal
<br>
pabulum).
