<p><p><em>&gt; The sense of self is an illusion.  Science has begun to show that our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of self, which seems to us continuous and central, and -- important --
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness or self-awareness.
</em><br>
<p><p>I understand the argument, and that our bodies and minds are playing

trcks on us. Delivering senses late, and then afterrationalise. Taking 
<br>
decisions and then telling the self that it was it who did it. But this 
<br>
does not mean that there is no self. It only means that we are a 
<br>
slightly more distributed system than most people think.
<br>
<p>But we do make conscious decisions every day, and rational ones at that. 
<br>
Or else we and society could not exist.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What even most technophiles don't realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that this sense of self is under constant revision, with memories lost,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and sometimes replaced with various degrees of inaccuracy, emotions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changing, and even &quot;processing capability&quot; changing all the time.  The sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self is an illusion.
</em><br>
<p><p>No. Changes are part of being alive. We are running the program so to 
<br>
speak. If we did not change we would be in a state of death. So living 
<br>
is changing.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What I find strange is that many people would generally agree with the above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paragraph, but then continue to think that preservation of this illusionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;self&quot; is an all-important goal.
</em><br>
<p><p>You have yet to proove that the self is illusionary! The theory goes 
<br>
against both common sense and observations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Philosophically-thinking (as opposed to evolutionarily-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-preservation thinking) perhaps we should value and promote the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;extropy&quot; of an individual.
</em><br>
<p><p>If there is no self, and no consciousnes, then there is no individual. 
<br>
So there is litlte meaning in being humanist at all. I need more 
<br>
evidence before I will change my beliefs that deeply.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; On this basis, I strongly disagree with Lee's assertion that the life of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 85-year old is less valuable than that of a 15-year old.  In extropic terms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think carrying on the 85 year-old knowledge base (given the means to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that)  is much more valuable.  In evolutionary-based terms, of course, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feels right to value the 15-year old who can better carry on the genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legacy.
</em><br>
<p><p>That is not all. It is also a question of &quot;economics.&quot; What will give 
<br>
the most years of high quality?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;The flesh is only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;interface that allows us to experience the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is this &quot;us&quot; you speak of, Human?  It is confusing to think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow &quot;you&quot; are separate from &quot;the world&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>But that is exactly the point! I am the state and the process. This 
<br>
state and process can be extracted and run in another computing media 
<br>
than this wetware. By current technology standards I am coupled together 
<br>
with the flesh, but theoretically it is possible to extract &quot;me&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It's a stretch to say that mathematics can be self aware.  It might be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful to say that self-awareness is an emergent property of certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information-processing systems, which can be described by mathematics.
</em><br>
<p>Yes that is more precise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;So the amusing thing is that, given enough time, it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;possible to run a program with a pencil, on a piece paper, that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;intelligence and conscience. If you stop writing the life ends and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;you kill your 'creature'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is this &quot;life&quot; you speak of, Human?  To make sense of this, you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only refer to information processing. If the program is written such that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has the feedback loops we call self-awareness, then it can be said to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious, without implying anything mystical.
</em><br>
<p><p>I am not implying anything mystical at all. But it is mind bending to 
<br>
think about. You remember, like being a child an imagining the 
<br>
endlessnes of the Universe.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Implying that something dies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the program stops running implies that there was something additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there that &quot;died&quot;.  That sense of self &quot;dying&quot; is the illusion I mentioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earlier. It's just a program running.  There is no &quot;self&quot; to die (in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger context.)
</em><br>
<p><p>No. Dying is the program stopping, and the computing medium being 
<br>
destroyed. Not nessecarily in that order ;-) There is no spirit. No life 
<br>
force, or anything like that. But there is a self, I am convinced. 
<br>
Naturally I will change my mind given the right evidence, but only then 
<br>
it will not be &quot;me&quot; that changes my mind, cause there would be no &quot;I&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; (I understand what is conventionally meant by &quot;self&quot;, I live with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion constantly *myself*, but we're seeing enough cracks in this theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now, and understand enough of it's evolutionary basis, that I'm suggesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we start getting used to a broader view, beyond personal identity (beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee's level 7)).
</em><br>
<p><p>I have read some articles, and a book, about it, but you should by no 
<br>
chance have some links? Then what is not i (WINI) would like to read more.
