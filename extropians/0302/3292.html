<p>Grisly Mexico Factory Breeds Man-Eating Flies

<p>By Elizabeth Fullerton
<br>
<p>TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - Tucked away in southern Mexico's 
<br>
jungly Chiapas state, scientists work around the clock using radiation and 
<br>
powdered blood to produce one of the area's most cutting-edge exports -- 
<br>
man-eating flies.
<br>
<p>Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, better known for spawning an 
<br>
armed rebellion in 1994 by guerrillas fighting for Indian rights, is home 
<br>
to the world's only New World screwworm plant, breeding millions of insects 
<br>
each week.
<br>
<p>Named for the corkscrew motion with which they burrow into flesh, the 
<br>
screwworm larvae can kill their victim -- human or animal -- in five days. 
<br>
The worm's Latin name, cochliomyia hominivorax, means &quot;fly that devours men.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;They feed off fresh blood, not dead tissue as other species do. That's why 
<br>
they are extremely dangerous. It's very hard for an animal to defend itself 
<br>
against something like that,&quot; said Alfredo Alvarez, a biologist at the plant.
<br>
<p>In the 1950s, U.S. scientists pioneered a strange but effective way of 
<br>
eradicating the pests. The flies are zapped with high doses of radiation to 
<br>
sterilize them then released into the wild to mate with their fertile 
<br>
counterparts.
<br>
<p>The females only mate once, so if they do so with the sterile flies, they 
<br>
will not reproduce.
<br>
<p>Using this technology, the United States by 1982 wiped out the bug that had 
<br>
threatened swathes of the nation's livestock.
<br>
<p>With the aim of gradually eradicating the worm from the American continent, 
<br>
the fly-producing factory in southern Mexico was started in 1976 by a joint 
<br>
U.S.-Mexican government commission and by 1992 Mexico was declared free of 
<br>
the screwworm.
<br>
<p>But there have been recurrences in Mexico recent years, some, ironically, 
<br>
due to errors at the fly factory that allowed millions of the killer flies 
<br>
to escape.
<br>
<p>Machine failure at the plant caused an outbreak of the disease in January 
<br>
that Alvarez described as a &quot;disaster.&quot;
<br>
<p>But thanks to the 27-year-old plant, the flies have been mostly wiped out 
<br>
in the southern United States, Mexico, Libya and across most of Central 
<br>
America.
<br>
<p>In the early 1990s, Mexico exported the flies to Libya, which was 
<br>
contaminated by South American cattle imports.
<br>
<p>The U.S.-Mexican commission is now selling its unusual product to Panama 
<br>
and Jamaica, where what look like cardboard lunch-boxes packed with black 
<br>
buzzing flies are dropped from planes to rid those areas of the 
<br>
bloodthirsty insect.
<br>
<p>VITAL ORGANS
<br>
<p>A fetid, overbearing stench of decay -- the odor from the waste that about 
<br>
90 million flies produce each week -- hits a visitor on arrival at the fly 
<br>
plant.
<br>
<p>It pervades clothing, hair and nostrils long after one leaves the plant, 
<br>
despite obligatory rigorous showering.
<br>
<p>Security is tight. All visitors and personnel are given clean overalls and 
<br>
boots for entering the production area, which is locked after them and has 
<br>
no windows.
<br>
<p>In the so-called &quot;fly colony,&quot; a loud buzzing emanates from row upon row of 
<br>
metal cages where thousands of fertile flies are kept alive and fattened 
<br>
for breeding.
<br>
<p>To the untrained eye, they resemble common house flies with blue-green 
<br>
bodies but these have bulging orange eyes.
<br>
<p>After seven days, the flies are mature enough to lay their eggs and are 
<br>
taken to a darkened room. They lay their eggs along long wooden sticks 
<br>
smeared with a gel that to them smells similar to a wound. The fly's 
<br>
average life cycle is 20 days.
<br>
<p>One fly can lay up to 400 eggs in a wound. Within 24 hours these hatch into 
<br>
larvae and begin burrowing into the meat.
<br>
<p>In two days, an open sore in an eye, for example, will turn into a 
<br>
grapefruit-sized festering wound of raw, pulpy flesh. The larvae eat their 
<br>
way toward the victim's vital organs.
<br>
<p>&quot;If the wound is in the stomach, they'll try to get to the liver or 
<br>
intestines. If it's in the head, they'll attack the eyes, the ears. They 
<br>
can reach the brain and then it's adios,&quot; said Alvarez, who is employed by 
<br>
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.
<br>
<p>The worm comes in two species -- the New World screwworm, native to the 
<br>
Western Hemisphere, and the Old World screwworm, found in Southeast Asia, 
<br>
the Middle East and parts of Africa.
<br>
<p>TRICKING THE WORMS
<br>
<p>In the incubation room, live wounds are mimicked in racks of hundreds of 
<br>
trays, using a brown gel containing powdered blood, milk and egg among 
<br>
other ingredients.
<br>
<p>Workers scrape the fly eggs off the wooden sticks and deposit them in these 
<br>
trays on top of a piece of paper towel.
<br>
<p>As they hatch into larvae, tiny white grubs begin to swarm over the brown 
<br>
muck. &quot;They are totally convinced they are attacking a warm animal,&quot; said 
<br>
Alvarez.
<br>
<p>Within 48 hours, the grubs have grown fatter and their diet must be 
<br>
replenished. &quot;This is equivalent to a worm moving to another zone of the 
<br>
body to find fresh flesh,&quot; said Alvarez.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From a distance, the huge trays resemble baking trays of brownies but at 
<br>
close range the mixture bubbles with the gouging and squirming of around 
<br>
20,000 worms per tray.
<br>
<p>By the third day the trays brim with thick brown-red goo as more gel is 
<br>
added to satisfy the worms' rapacious appetite. The smell is at its most 
<br>
rancid.
<br>
<p>As they reach maturity, the grubs jump out of the trays, falling into 
<br>
funnels where they are scooped up and poured by the thousands into trays 
<br>
with sawdust covering them. They are left for 24 hours to develop a shell 
<br>
and become pupae.
<br>
<p>After five and a half days the pupae are put in plastic cylinders and 
<br>
exposed to around two minutes of radiation. The amount of radiation is 11 
<br>
times the minimum needed to kill a human being but the flies are tough.
<br>
<p>Once they have been irradiated, the pupae are placed in ice coolers to slow 
<br>
the process of their maturing into flies.
<br>
<p>The high-tech plant, a rarity in the impoverished and heavily agricultural 
<br>
state of Chiapas, exports the &quot;chilled flies&quot; twice-weekly to Panama and 
<br>
Jamaica.
<br>
<p>INVASION OF THE FLIES
<br>
<p>The United States now plans to build a plant in Panama to create a sterile 
<br>
fly barrier against flies from South America.
<br>
<p>But the story has its failures too.
<br>
<p>Despite stringent security procedures such as numerous fly traps in and 
<br>
outside the plant, special clothing and the stationing of boxes of sterile 
<br>
flies around the perimeter to mate with fertile escapees, there have been 
<br>
outbreaks.
<br>
<p>Last month, the plant had its worst ever when a radiation machine 
<br>
malfunctioned. Millions of fertile flies were sent into the wild in Mexico 
<br>
and Panama. To date 50 cases of the disease have been found in animals in 
<br>
Panama and 44 in Chiapas.
<br>
<p>The damage could escalate and take months to repair.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a disaster for us. We're on national alert,&quot; said Alvarez. &quot;The 
<br>
outbreak gives us an inkling of what could happen if the flies were used as 
<br>
a biological weapon in a terror attack. It could be very dangerous.&quot;
