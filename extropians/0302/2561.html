<em>&gt; One of the things our excessive taxations are used for is an extensive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public transporation system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have subsidided trains and busses galore, so that nobody actually

<p>I disagree. I live less than 100 feet away from a main north/south Train line 
<br>
in England and just 5 minutes walk from the local station. I live outside the 
<br>
M25 and can travel to london in about 30 minutes by train. Fantastic!. 
<br>
However The nearest large town is just 6 miles away and to the west. in order 
<br>
to get there by train, I have to travel 20 miles south, change lines and then 
<br>
out to my destination. The train journey takes over 90 minutes. In the car, I 
<br>
can get there in 10 minutes and the same driven journey by Bus takes around 
<br>
40 minutes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble with public transport systems is that they don't get you 
<br>
where you want to go either quickly enough, Cheaply enough or comfortably 
<br>
enough. I wouldn't care if the bus journey went via the moon if the journey 
<br>
met the above three criteria. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my situation travel by public transport is only an option when 
<br>
travelling north/south and when I travel to London, 90% of the time I go by 
<br>
train. East/west journeys are strictly car only.
<br>
<p>I came up with an idea a while back when working a fair distance from home. 
<br>
the reason I was having to travel so far every day was that I couldn't find a 
<br>
similar job locally. The funny thing was that I knew someone that I used to 
<br>
work with, who was doing almost an Identical job to me in the town next to 
<br>
mine. The funnier thing was that the town I travelled to was the town where 
<br>
he lived.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed each other on the same motorway every day as we both fought 
<br>
our way through traffic.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't take a genius to see what's wrong with this picture. So It 
<br>
raises the question. What would happen if a law was passed that meant you 
<br>
could only work within a certain radius of your home? This is probably a tad 
<br>
strict, so I thought a better way would be to Tax people on the distance they 
<br>
travel to work.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure whether this would change how far people travel in 
<br>
general. Common sense says it would, but Then common sense also says that you 
<br>
pay more in Fuel Tax by travelling further anyway. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aside, have you ever tried to get a wheel chair on a bus? It 
<br>
isn't pretty.
