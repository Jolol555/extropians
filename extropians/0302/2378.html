I saw an interesting company in Northern Ohio, can't remember the name
<br>
right now, but at the same time  they built their new manufacturing
<br>
facility in a highly rural area, they built a housing development and
<br>
apartment complex within eyesight of the plant and opened the housing
<br>
only to company employees.
<br>
<p>Can you imagine how much commute time and energy cost is being saved by
<br>
the people walking, biking, or hopping on the Van shuttle to get to
<br>
work?
<br>
<p>If they installed an underground tunnel between the apartment complex
<br>
and the plant you wouldn't even need to step outside on a snowy day.
<br>
<p>Has there been any studies on planned communities like this and the
<br>
return on investment?
<br>
<p>I commuted 1 1/4 hrs each way to work for 4 yrs. And had at least 5 very
<br>
close calls on the highway.
<br>
I wasted $100/month on gasoline $360/month auto wear and tear.  The
<br>
above company was very forward thinking.  The government should initiate
<br>
some type of tax incentive for companies who do this type of thing!

<p><p><p>Spike:
<br>
<em>&gt; Those nations such as Italy and Babylon, that were invented before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there were cars, are set up differently.  Ive seen pictures of them, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its truly amazing.  There are *homes* right down *in* the city with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the businesses and stuff.  They needn't drive far.  What a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept!
</em><br>
<p>In the ancient Rome traffic was a real tragedy. Carts, beasts
<br>
everywhere. And no sidewalk was there. And stalls spread all over the
<br>
city. Caesar issued a law to prevent daily traffic, from dawn to sunset.
<br>
Just very important people could send their carts for shopping. So
<br>
later, at night, the traffic was constant. So Adrianus issued another
<br>
law, to prevent traffic from sunset to dawn!
