</em><br>

<em>&gt; The problem seems to be that it gets fashionable in the US and Europe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to transform democratic structures into bureaucratic and eventually
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; sliding down a slippery road to totalitarism.
</em><br>
<p>It is popular to blame lobbyists, but one has to remember that it is
<br>
the citizens that largely endorse the system and keep incumbents in
<br>
power by not speaking out.  There is nothing inevitable in democratic
<br>
declines, it is just that it is both a public good problem and that
<br>
many feel it hard to struggle against &quot;the way things are&quot;. But in the
<br>
end it is a cultural matter.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the thing to aim for is to create institutions that prevent
<br>
such bureaucratic-totalitarian slides (division of power,
<br>
accountability, freedom of information rules, budget limitations) and
<br>
to create institutions intended to bootstrap the next reasonable
<br>
government after the current one has calcified. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally, I find the current copyright craze even more scary. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I read how eagerly McCarthy's heirs (Homeland foobar) grab power

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hope the Americans don't wait 'till witch hunting starts.
</em><br>
<p>A lot hinges on the civil society and its values. That is why I'm not 
<br>
that worried about the US becoming McCarthyland (or Europe, for that 
<br>
matter), there is too much diversity and acceptance of diversity these 
<br>
days. Which doesn't mean things can't become very nasty, but it seems 
<br>
likely that the &quot;forces of evil&quot; do not have the cultural advantage 
<br>
even if they gain the organisational advantage. But the political 
<br>
developments over the last years have been frightening, mainly because 
<br>
the new threats against freedom have arrived from very different 
<br>
directions - anti-terrorism, intellectual property, 
<br>
internationalisation of law etc. Many of these threats are completely 
<br>
incidental, the decline of freedom is not a goal at all of the groups 
<br>
pursuing them. Unintended consequences are everywhere.
<br>
<p>I guess one thing we as transhumanists can do is to exploit our
<br>
somewhat different perspective. We see technology and humanity
<br>
co-evolving, the present merely as a phase in a far greater process
<br>
and have great liberty in what issues and concepts to problematize. 
<br>
That means we can bring fresh perspectives completely outside the
<br>
mainstream discourse into it, which is efficient at meeting the often
<br>
conventional-thinking based threats.
