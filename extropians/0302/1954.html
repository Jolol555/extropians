<p>Greg, this will likely become a matter of focus
<br>
in the next few weeks.  Had the shuttle been able
<br>
to make it to the ISS with damaged wing tiles,
<br>
they still would have been cooked, because the
<br>
ISS has no means of repairing tiles on orbit.
<br>
Of course the crew might have been able to sit
<br>
tight at the station and be rescued by the ACRV
<br>
or something I suppose.
<br>
<p>In those cases where they cannot reach the ISS,
<br>
NASA has decided there is no point in going
<br>
outdoors on an EVA.  It would be like being
<br>
lost at sea waiting to perish of starvation
<br>
or thirst, with the exception that they would
<br>
be full in radio contact with earth.  spike
