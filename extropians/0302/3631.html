A few thoughts on mass panic....
<br>
<p>I think that there ARE real new threats everyday. To deny this is
<br>
irrational. To react with reason, moreso than fear is logical. 
<br>
<p>The Politicans and their families in Washington DC have more to fear
<br>
than most anybody, as DC is probably pretty high on terrorists target
<br>
lists. 
<br>
<p>Fear can be used as a motivator for good or bad. In boxing and martial
<br>
arts for example, if you can strike fear into your opponent, you have an
<br>
advantage. Your opponent, however, fearing losing, may train very hard
<br>
and be prepared come fight day.
<br>
<p>I talk to most of my friends and many of the emotions that I see are
<br>
fatalism, fear, who cares, or a fighting attitude. Very few are actually
<br>
preparing for much of anything. Most seem to want to just go along as if
<br>
nothing has changed.
<br>
<p>Many friends say something like &quot;more people are killed in car accidents
<br>
than terrorism&quot; to which I say &quot;You must look at the rate; 10 years ago,
<br>
car deaths were X, today they are ~ X+10%, whereas 10 years ago, there
<br>
were X terrorism incidents (in USA) today there is ~10X&quot; Extrapolate out
<br>
this trend, the rate of increase of terrorism is increasing much faster
<br>
than anything, except obesity in USA :-) 
<br>
<p>To pretend that things are the same does not help anybody. If I were a
<br>
fighter and was told I had to fight Mike Tyson, I would first shit, then
<br>
train like mad, then tape my ears up, then fight! I would pretend he is
<br>
just another average fighter.
<br>
<p>This is a stress on society, much like the ice age was on our ancestors.
<br>
Probably some of them said &quot;don't worry, it will not get much colder&quot;
<br>
while others developed fire and moved together as communities to stay
<br>
warm.
<br>
<p>What I am fearful of is that I feel that technological innovation is
<br>
forcing us to evolve rapidly as a society but everybody in doing the
<br>
wrong things. Many are saying &quot;Don't Worry&quot;, the military at the same
<br>
time is co-opting technology in the name of preparing. Nanotech,
<br>
Biotech, Infotech all may become weapons of tomorrow.
<br>
<p>I would advocate the opposite appraoch, be concerned, but use it to come
<br>
together as a society and world. Small groups can cause increasingly bad
<br>
things to happen. I agree, subways may be a bad investment. Air travel
<br>
and tourism are not good investments. Globalism might not be the best
<br>
economic trend. Invest in plastic bubbles! Unfortunately, nobody is. So
<br>
the problem I see is that in addition to depressed economies from lack
<br>
of tourism, we also will not have plastic bubbles! That is called
<br>
lose-lose. Use technology to feed the poor so they do not want to kill
<br>
the rich!
<br>
<p>What we do not want to do is let fear motivate bad decisions by our
<br>
leaders. Fear of terrorism in Israel has allowed them to stay in thie
<br>
fear mode and not look for solutions. The threat is not just Islamists,
<br>
if the gov cracks down hard enough here, homegrown terrorists will
<br>
emerge, or just sociopaths (12 monkeys)
<br>
<p>I consider myself a Brinista, who believes lots of Transparency, not
<br>
imposed Orwellian like on us, but volunteered in a positive way is part
<br>
of the solution.
<br>
<p>At 40, I no longer think heart disease is my biggest risk, weapons of
<br>
mass destruction are. I am simply a concerned moderate person who is
<br>
trying to think of SOLUTIONS.

Subject: weapons of mass panic
<br>
<p><p>Nova, the science and technology TV program, has
<br>
demonstrated to the entire world some relatively
<br>
easy and cheap ways to spread radiation using
<br>
any metropolitan subway.  They correctly reported
<br>
that the subway could be made effectively useless
<br>
even with an amount of radiation far below what
<br>
would pose an actual significant health danger.
<br>
<p>Some months ago I speculated similarly, that a
<br>
terrorist could easily obtain some type of legal
<br>
and harmless radioactive material such as Americium
<br>
from smoke detectors, power it, spread it using
<br>
ordinary commerically available fireworks, then
<br>
watch the proles panic.  Geiger counters do not
<br>
actually identify the type of radiation, only
<br>
that there is radiation of some kind.  If a news
<br>
agency reported that a low level of radiation
<br>
is discovered in the subway, the people wouldn't
<br>
even read the second line, that the level is
<br>
considered harmless.
<br>
<p>I have never seen it used as an argument against
<br>
mass transit, but we should consider that especially
<br>
subways are so vulnerable to terrorists they might
<br>
already be considered a very bad investment of
<br>
public funds.  spike
