</em><br>
<p>I don't think its so much the number of people deciding an issue 
<br>
that determines whether or not any decision is rational what seems
<br>
to be more important is the process by which they decide. Because
<br>
the UN is a &quot;club&quot; of Member nations who gets to sit in the General 
<br>
Assembly and on the Security Council on behalf of their particular
<br>
country will in very large part be effected by the processes of
<br>
by which governments are formed (which in turn appoint their
<br>
representatives) in any particular country. What I think we can be 
<br>
fairly confident of however is that those who are representing any
<br>
country at the UN will be pretty capable in comparison to the run
<br>
of the mill member of their society when it comes to being able to
<br>
make and rebut arguments. Intelligence matters in all countries and
<br>
all countries have enough members to choose from to ensure that
<br>
more rather than less intelligent representatives will represent the
<br>
governments of those countries at the UN.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then the media takes hold of the positions and propaganda 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flourishes. Before you know it you have two people arguing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over wether France sold Iraq illegal weapons. To argue about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something when neither party in the argument can give accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information is futile. 
</em><br>
<p>Its only futile if you assume the point of all arguments is to 
<br>
communicate or to find the truth. In political forums this is almost 
<br>
never the case. In political forums the point of argument is seldom
<br>
to persuade the person one is ostensibly arguing with the point is 
<br>
to make some sort of impression on the far greater numbers of 
<br>
people listening in. In political forums it is more often numbers that
<br>
count not the power of an arguement. A powerful argument is only
<br>
of interest politically when it results in larger numbers of people 
<br>
agreeing with what you (or your government) want them to agree
<br>
with. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be like me trying to argue that two people on this list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know but I heard from this third person are idiots. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument is meaningless.
</em><br>
<p>Its only meaningless if you keep thinking in two dimensions as 
<br>
an argument being basically about two adversaries engaged in 
<br>
a search for the truth. If you think that the speakers are speaking
<br>
for the benefit of the audience then a lot more things will make
<br>
sense.
<br>
<p>The truth is almost never the point in political discourse, because
<br>
political discourse is concerned with creating an environment that
<br>
will facilitate a particular outcome and this usually takes numbers.
<br>
In political discourse what matters is which &quot;truth&quot; gets to be talked
<br>
about. If you and I were to get into a public discussion about the
<br>
truth or falsehood of me being a rotten scoundrel then regardless 
<br>
of whether I am a rotten scoundrel or not I would in most cases
<br>
be performing poorly as a politcal operator to even be having 
<br>
such an unhelpful discussion for me in front of an audience. If your
<br>
intention was to discredit me and you could entice me into a
<br>
serious discussion about whether or not I was a rotten scoundrel
<br>
then their would be a point to what you were doing and I would
<br>
be obliging you by taking you up on your choice of topic rather
<br>
than making another one of my own. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The  first question of an argument 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be &quot;what are we hoping to solve&quot; it he answer is nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than what's the point?
</em><br>
<p>This is true if both parties are seeking to discover shared truth. Alas
<br>
when you add an audience as in debates in front of an audience 
<br>
or in all political exchanges it ceases to be entirely about that.
