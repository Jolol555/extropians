<em>&gt; What's good about defending a country?  I certainly don't give a damn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the US or any other country, and I have little patience for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patriots of any stripe.  How about standing up for /principles/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of countries like a rational forward-looking person should?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The old concept of &quot;country&quot; is one whose time is passed.  Let's move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the future and support the rights of sovereign sentient beings.

<p>That's all well and good, but nations are key in these affairs. There is a
<br>
fundamental issue of representation (or lack thereof), in aggression between
<br>
nations, because the citizens of any given nation are not represented by
<br>
other nation's governments. Thus the concept of democracy breaks down in
<br>
these issues of world governance (a euphemism which grants the benefit of
<br>
the doubt to the involved parties). I believe that this issue is at the
<br>
heart of much of the world's problem with the concept of anyone playing
<br>
&quot;World Policeman&quot; (again a favourable euphemism).
<br>
<p>So IMO the main issue in the Iraq situation is that of domination of the
<br>
majority by the minority. Even domination of the minority by the majority
<br>
would be a problematic situation. The principle involved is Freedom, and
<br>
it's worth jumping up and down about.
<br>
<p>I think LDC is not a big fan of nations, and I certainly agree with him on
<br>
that one. Ignoring them is not an option, however, and declaring them
<br>
dinosaurs wont stop me becoming T-Rex breakfast.
