<p>Friend mez, that's like paying a gila monster to not have toxic saliva.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be building schools and
<br>
<em>&gt; training teachers.  We should be paying the poor of impoverished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries to build infrastructure in those places, just as we did in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US during the great depression.
</em><br>
<p>And that's labeled cultural imperialism, neocolonialism and oppression.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Those are the steps that will reduce global poverty, hopelessness, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fanaticism.
</em><br>
<p>As the old gentleman farmer said in the joke, &quot;Y' can't get theyah from heyah&quot;.
<br>
<p>I hear (I give it about 30% odds) that there are Masai kids watching MTV
<br>
videos in grass shacks in Africa with satellite dishes. See my second
<br>
comment.
<br>
<p>I share your opinion about the several sources of grievance. But the future's
<br>
not being evenly distributed is even trickier than the solutions you propose
<br>
can solve.
<br>
<p>E.g., the people most motivated to do good works in downtrodden places tend
<br>
to be religieuses or other do-gooders with side effects. Just giving aid
<br>
money or goods out has predictable consequences, too (theft by autocrats,
<br>
warlords, etc.). And _everyone_ wants a quick fix for exactly the subset of
<br>
&quot;the&quot; problem, pretty much everywhere, that _they_ care about--that's a
<br>
tautology. Do this, but leave that alone or I'll hate you.
<br>
<p>And on top of that, the cultural effects of the deluge of media tend to run
<br>
wild overall. I'm not in a position of advocating censorship, but the blender
<br>
gets some realy strange bits whizzing around in it.
<br>
<p>Trickle-down plus spin-around are not doing it, I agree. Maybe I'm more
<br>
bitter than I admit to myself.
<br>
<p>MMB
