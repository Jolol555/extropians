<p>Part of this is just that NASA is run politically.  The Shuttle program,
<br>
in particular, is so focused on reusability that efficiency falls by the
<br>
wayside.  (Okay, I'm ready for a certain rocket engineer to chime in
<br>
with &quot;you don't throw away a 747 everytime you fly it.&quot;  If the cost of
<br>
maintaining the plane after one flight were more than building a new, I
<br>
would.  Throwaway Saturn Vs would probably be more efficient and maybe
<br>
even safer than the Shuttles.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Replacements cheap enough to operate that

</em><br>
<p>It's not just that, but also the culture at NASA.  It's slowly changing,
<br>
but it seems focused on a certain type of conservatism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, don't accuse me of being insensitive here.
</em><br>
<p>It's not insensitive to discuss these issues openly.  I think all of us
<br>
feel some loss here.  This does not mean we shut off our brains.

<p><em>&gt; One of the mission specialists was a personal

<p>I'm not so sure, but I tend to side with you here.  We have to get the

facts in first to see what happened and why before judging this

particular tragedy.
<br>
<p>BTW, I posted this on Starship Forum

Subject: [Starship_Forum] Rocket engine performance
<br>
<p>A few days ago, SpaceDaily.com reported that &quot;Ion Engine Prototype
<br>
Passes 18000 Hours Of Autonomous Operation.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/rocketscience-03b.html">http://www.spacedaily.com/news/rocketscience-03b.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;]  This brings to mind a problem that will have to be solved for long
<br>
duration missions and space settlement: long-term performance of rocket
<br>
engines.
<br>
<p>There are three not so radical solutions I can conceive to this problem.
<br>
One is to design engines that are more reliable and have better
<br>
long-term performance, including being able to start and stop frequently
<br>
as well as remain active and inactive for long periods without a
<br>
noticeable degradation in performation.  This is the Rolls-Royce
<br>
approach, though the name shouldn't make it sound expensive.  The goal
<br>
is to produce an overall excellent engine.
<br>
<p>I can imagine such engines being tested just like the Japanese ion
<br>
thruster above -- set to run and run and run.  (In fact, part of the
<br>
design process could be to just take an existing prototype, running it
<br>
for a long time until it fails, then creating a better prototype to
<br>
account for the failure(s), and repeating the process.  This incremental
<br>
approach might work.)
<br>
<p>Another is to come up with maintenance and repair processes for engines
<br>
so that degradation in performance can be corrected.  This is kind of
<br>
the Oil Change approach -- keep it well maintained and fix any problems
<br>
to extend equipment life span.
<br>
<p>Such engines would either have to be designed for easy maintenance and
<br>
repair or [an inclusive &quot;or&quot;] maintenance and repair methods will have
<br>
to be designed to make this work.
<br>
<p>A third approach is to make cheap modular engines -- the &quot;Throw Away&quot;
<br>
approach -- that can be pulled when they degrade.  This can be extended
<br>
to cheap throw away propulsion systems -- where the whole propulsion
<br>
system is replaced when it starts to degrade.
<br>
<p>Conceptually, this is simpler and might allow for a variety of
<br>
propulsion systems if modularity is taken to an extreme.  One could
<br>
imagine a spacecraft that can be mated to any sort of standard plug in
<br>
propulsion system -- be it chemical, ion, nuclear electric, or something
<br>
else -- if object-oriented design is observed.
<br>
<p>This same sort of logic -- Rolls-Royce vs. Oil Change vs. Throw Away can
<br>
be applied to all other spacecraft systems, such as life support, waste
<br>
management, power supply, heating/cooling, information systems, and
<br>
communications.  No doubt, all three approaches will be used.  I can
<br>
imagine, especially, wanting life support and power systems to be more
<br>
like Rolls-Royces, while propulsion in some cases being Oil Change, and
<br>
many other minor systems being Throw Aways.  No doubt, the mix will be
<br>
different depending on a host of factors, inlcuding how well established
<br>
trade is (the spectrum can run from highly integrated to autarkic).
<br>
<p>What do you think?

<p>BTW, earlier, I was mistaken about astronaut Ilan Ramon's parents.  It
<br>
was, from what I've now heard, his grandmother who was a survivor of a
<br>
concentration camp.
