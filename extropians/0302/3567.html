Spike:
<br>
<em>&gt;Nova, the science and technology TV program, has demonstrated to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entire world some relatively easy and cheap ways to spread radiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;using any metropolitan subway.[...]
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Some months ago I speculated similarly, that a terrorist could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easily obtain some type of legal and harmless radioactive material
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such as Americium from smoke detectors, power it, spread it using
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ordinary commerically available fireworks, then watch the proles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;panic.[...]
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I have never seen it used as an argument against mass transit, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we should consider that especially subways are so vulnerable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorists they might already be considered a very bad investment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;public funds. spike
</em><br>
<p><p>What is going on here? Perhaps your report is true, but isn't it too
<br>
much? Haven't you reached a point where you say to yourself: 'enough
<br>
is enough'? For me that point, was 1 1/2 years ago.
<br>
<p>Shall we live in underground bunkers, fearful to breathe, fearful to
<br>
walk, fearful to think ...? We hear 'War on Terrorism' used in the
<br>
same fascist way as the 'War on Drugs' and now 'Weapons of XXXXXXX'
<br>
(fill in your latest fear) in the same way! Now on the transhumanism
<br>
lists are people speculating endlessly about how a handful of
<br>
extremists can bring on the extinction of our species and we should
<br>
greatly change and alter our lives, accordingly, based on that fear.
<br>
The Grand Security Theatre is doing a fine job at promoting that fear.
<br>
<p>Apparently, I'm not 'getting the message' that many of you are
<br>
getting, because I find myself more and more frustrated and sad to
<br>
see people's obsession with fearful thoughts. This is *your life*.
<br>
Do you really want to spend it this way?
<br>
<p>I won't change my life for the latest government / media report of
<br>
the scare-of-the-week, because it looks like more  Paranoia-Ville.
<br>
and I refuse to buy into that.
<br>
<p>To save my typing fingers I'll paste what I wrote to the wta-talk
<br>
list a few days ago on the same topic.

<p>Subject: Re: Re: Magic duct tape
<br>
<p>I am not sure if the topic here is self-defense or security, but
<br>
regarding security, I am very sad that so many people's lives are
<br>
absorbed with the (false) notion of 'safety'.  And I am very angry
<br>
that a few people in control-happy and and power-hungry governments
<br>
have seized on (and taken advantage of) people's fears from
<br>
September 11 to massively build up (what did already exist) the
<br>
Security Theatre and the Military Machines that we are experiencing
<br>
in the world today. There's an enormous amplifying feedback loop
<br>
monster in place now. This monster is the collection of human
<br>
violence, fears, anxieties, hatreds, suspicions, which was present
<br>
before, but emerged in a new form. I had a fleeting hope after
<br>
September 11 that government entities and a large number of people
<br>
would reflect on their actions and work to understand what happened
<br>
to diffuse the monster. But instead of diffusing that monster,
<br>
foreign and defense policies (especially those of the United States
<br>
government) are amplifying the fears to a WWIII.
<br>
<p>There have always been and there always will be extremists at the
<br>
boundaries of societies and cultures. You (general &quot;you&quot;) have
<br>
choices. You can choose to live your life motivated by your own life
<br>
or you can choose to live your life motivated by others, including
<br>
those extremists.
<br>
<p>If you choose the first, then what are some things that might happen
<br>
as you are life-propelled? In that case the extremists are actively
<br>
ignored, they might direct their deathist wishes on each other, and
<br>
eventually they will die. Along the way, your actions might serve as
<br>
an example of the good things possible. And even if those 'better'
<br>
ways are not understood by others, leaving them alone to their
<br>
choices shows respect for other people, places, and cultures.
<br>
<p>For the latter, those that want to wipe out the extremists have to
<br>
expend something and there are aftereffects. How much attention,
<br>
(money and time) is it worth to one's life to making your life
<br>
'safe' (safe: what an weird concept!) from those extremists? Is it
<br>
worth 50% of your life? 70%? 90% ? Your whole life? Your progeny's
<br>
lives? What if the aftereffects are that the number of extremists
<br>
increases exponentially?
<br>
<p>In my opinion, these are the questions what every person should be
<br>
asking themselves.
<br>
<p>(What to do about existing large rogue governments is yet another
<br>
topic.)
