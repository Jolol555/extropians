<p>
Lee,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;(by the way, welcome back to the list, Brent!)&lt;&lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<p>Thanks!  It’s great to be back.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I guess that the closest I'm coming so far to your
</em><br>
position is a 2D picture of the 3D object.  You believe
<br>
that there is a little 3D model of the external object
<br>
somewhere in the brain.  Right? &lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>The thing we know for certain is that subjectively, the information is 3D.  
<br>
There are many great, IMO, arguments that it is indeed more or less 3D in the 
<br>
brain also – but this need not be the case.
<br>
<p>For example lets take your 2D picture and look at the layer of neurons just in 
<br>
front of (closer to the center of the brain) than where the scientists found 
<br>
the picture of the display.  I would argue that this layer likely represents 
<br>
the space just in front of the monitor.  (Of course since the space in front of 
<br>
the monitor is empty the people observing the monkeys brain wouldn’t have 
<br>
noticed anything even if they were looking for something.)
<br>
<p>You could take some of these neurons in front of the display and move them to 
<br>
some other different location in the brain, while maintaining the same synaptic 
<br>
connections and subjectively the experience would be the same 3D one even 
<br>
though the spatial location in the brain was now different.  But the more you 
<br>
have this kind of deviation, the longer and more complex the synapse wiring has 
<br>
to be to achieve the same subjective experience.  This is simply one good 
<br>
argument for real 3D representations.
<br>
<p>But this is all of lesser importance to the fact that we experience a real 3D 
<br>
subjective space.  There is some way that our brain represents this subjective 
<br>
space, even if it isn’t with actual voxel (3D pixel) neurons in the same 3D 
<br>
configuration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, again, the words can mean either thing.  It's a
</em><br>
little bit like the puzzler &quot;do we see airplanes, or
<br>
do we see the photons reflected off the airplanes?&quot;
<br>
I like to say that we see the airplanes, but I know
<br>
what people mean when they say that we see photons.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Precisely.  The only thing that sees the airplane is the photons.  The only 
<br>
thing that sees the photons is the surface of our retina… and so on down the 
<br>
causal chain of perception.  It is physically impossible for us to be directly 
<br>
aware of the airplain the way it SEEMS we do.
<br>
<p>Finally all this cause and effect results in a subjectively 3D representation 
<br>
of the airplane with a subjective representation of ourselves looking out holes 
<br>
in our skulls at it.  All of this subjective information being in our brain.  
<br>
When we say &quot;we see the airplane&quot; this entire process is what this means.  We 
<br>
must remember that cause and effect perception only goes one way.  It SEEMS 
<br>
like we look out of the holes in our skulls through the windows of our eyes to 
<br>
see the airplane, but in reality the cause and effect of perception flows in 
<br>
the opposite direction.  You have to think very carefully not to think 
<br>
irrationally about this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;What you need to stress---and you do---
</em><br>
is that there is some kind of true-to-life model in
<br>
the brain, whereas I think that most people on this
<br>
list believe that the representation of objects in
<br>
the brain is much more subtle, the encoding much, much
<br>
more obscure. &lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>People tend to think this way when they aren’t thinking clearly and rationally 
<br>
about how cause and effect perception works.  People think that red is 
<br>
something on the airplane and they think our brain doesn’t require anything 
<br>
like red to represent this.  If people would just stop and think carefully 
<br>
about this things become very clear, simple and obvious.  When this happens you 
<br>
can finally realize what the future holds for our minds once we start effing, 
<br>
expanding and sharing the conscious experience in our brains.
<br>
<p>Once you realize all this you know how stupid it is to think things like the 
<br>
Turing test will forever be the best tool we have to determine how conscious 
<br>
another being is and so on.  I wish people on this list, science fiction 
<br>
writes, and people like Raymond Kurzweil and most everyone else would stop 
<br>
being so foolish and irrational in this way.
<br>
