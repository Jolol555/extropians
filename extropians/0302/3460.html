Stirling Westrup, Wed Feb 12, 2003 09:47 pm:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yeah, I guess the 'polarizing incident' is a correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assessment. I have a real problem with the fact that the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;majority of times I've talked to a proponent of theory &lt;X&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;said &quot;You know, the recent discovery of &lt;Y&gt; is inconsistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with this theory&quot;, the response has been a personal attack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Usually it takes the form of an assumption that I must be in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some non-&lt;X&gt; camp, or that I therefore believe any number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insane theories from the lunatic fringe.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe that person is simply overworked, leaving very little buffer
<br>
to talk normally ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Its been rather rare, but refreshing, when the answer is a shrug and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an &quot;Well, we're looking into that. We may need to change the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think scientists are any different from 'normal' people who
<br>
have a hard time admitting that they are wrong or that they don't know
<br>
something. That's a tough one for many people, and I think that
<br>
psychologists have just as many clients who are scientists as people
<br>
who work in other professions (that would be an interesting
<br>
statistic to see though). Writing a PhD should break some of those
<br>
bad habits, though, because I think that's a very humbling
<br>
experience, right at the beginning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not anti-science, just anti-stupidity, and the point I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attempting to make was that stupidity and rigidity of thought are as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prevalent in the sciences as everywhere else, and (as far as I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discern) in roughly the same proportions as in any other field of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human endeavour including, for example, business administration.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I was initially very surprised at this, since I had always assumed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the sciences would be self-selecting for the best and the brightest,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and that scientists would be interested foremost in the truth, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would not heavily invest ego into whatever theory they currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;favoured.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know who were all of the scientists you met- there are
<br>
different fields with different proportions of ego-heads. The cosmic
<br>
dust field, for example, has almost none of that ego-head nonsense.
<br>
(My sample is about 50 people)
<br>
<p>I would still say that scientists are a little more interested in
<br>
true answers than other people, but I don't think that they are
<br>
vastly different in psychological profile regarding ego. The only
<br>
area that they might be self-selecting that looks different is their
<br>
willingness (mapping to a daily motivation) to work hard for little
<br>
money.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;All that being said, you will note that the vast majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cosmological press releases (including the one someone included in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this thread) emphasize not the changes to theories that the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;results will require, but how well they always fit with existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theories.
</em><br>
<p>They might be using 'theory' too vaguely. There's the following
<br>
aspects to consider too. (Some quotes... A friend gave me some nifty
<br>
quotes by astronomers and other scientists yesterday and I'm itching
<br>
to use them)
<br>
<p>&quot;The trouble is that inflation is a paradigm rather than a model,
<br>
and has many different realizations which can lead to a range of
<br>
different predictions.&quot; ---Andrew Liddle
<br>
<p>&quot;A theory has only the alternative of being right or wrong.  A model
<br>
has a third possibility: it may be right, but irrelevant.&quot;
<br>
---Manfred Eigen
<br>
<p>&quot;The purpose of models is not to fit the data but to sharpen the
<br>
questions.&quot; ---Samuel Carlin
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My own personal theory is that they are afraid that any portrayal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the most exciting part of scientific discovery, the &quot;Uh oh, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of result is THIS?&quot;, will somehow allow the lunatic fringe to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gain a toehold and start announcing that the universe is shaped like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a chicken, or some nonsense.
</em><br>
<p>No that doesn't seem right to me. The scientists I have experience
<br>
with truly love that moment when the see something and say to
<br>
themselves: &quot;Oh.. now _that_ is odd ...&quot; I don't know of scientists
<br>
who are motivated by what the lunatic fringe will think. Even the
<br>
Mars scientists I know, who have more than their average volume of
<br>
fringe people to deal with, are not driven that way.
<br>
<p>Could it be that there was a dropout in proper lingo so that you
<br>
weren't communicating the question(s) clearly, or else they
<br>
were not grasping the meaning of your words? Maybe they thought
<br>
you meant something different.
<br>
<p>If the scientists treat something that is a model as a 'law' then
<br>
they are wrong to approach it that way, but I don't think that the
<br>
fringe element has anything to do with that behavior. More likely
<br>
the scientist is ignorant of the context of the model, in other
<br>
words, what are the ranges of relevance of that model and so
<br>
they might be applying the model too broadly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Anyway, I hope that the above post gives a better understanding of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where I was coming from in my last post. To bring things full
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circle, my original reply to the post that started this thread was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just trying to point out that it is generally not possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determine the &quot;likelyhood&quot;, &quot;strength&quot;, &quot;staying power&quot; or similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;metric of a given theory by either consulting the popular press or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surveying random scientists in the field. Either method will end up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heavily biased in favor of whatever is the current big theory.
</em><br>
<p>I would think that surveying random scientists (in the field in
<br>
question) would yield a good approximation of the best theory,
<br>
though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I suppose you could even test this statement, given a sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;historical database of now-defunct theories and the popular and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;private communications of the major scientific players in the field.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Certainly, the (admittedly small amount) that I have read on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history of scientific innovations seems to support my conjecture.
</em><br>
<p>It's a history of science question, so perhaps there's a thesis
<br>
completed on this topic ..? (out of my area of expertise ..
<br>
maybe someone in extroland can answer this )
