ML&gt; Successfully used public mass transit is a
<br>
ML&gt; paramount sign of a mature and ingrained socialist society.
<br>
<p>DB&gt; I dunno about that, but it sure makes life in Melbourne considerably
<br>
DB&gt; more comfortable and pleasant than it would be otherwise. New York,
<br>
DB&gt; too, for that matter.
<br>
<p>Yep, I think Mike's case is a bit overstated.  There can be, and has
<br>
been, successful private profit-making mass transit.  One I remember,
<br>
for example, is the private bus system that Las Vegas had until it was
<br>
taken over by force and replaced with a government system.  It was sold
<br>
to the public as a way to make the system cheaper and ensure that it
<br>
would cover outlying areas that the successful private system didn't.
<br>
It does in fact now cover more areas than the private system did, but
<br>
it is now more expensive and far less reliable.
<br>
<p>BART in the San Francisco area is nominally a private enterprize, but
<br>
it does benefit from some subsidies.  It certainly could be successful
<br>
as a private system, since it is extremely useful to residents and does
<br>
in fact make about as much money in fares as it takes to maintain.  One
<br>
major reason it isn't, though, is that the bus and taxicab lobbies are
<br>
fighting hard against allowing it to extend to the airport, which would
<br>
likely double its revenues with little extra expense.
