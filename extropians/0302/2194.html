<p><em>&gt; If there is no soul, as I am convinced. And if uploading is possible, as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am convinced, then the I/mind is just the calculations taking place 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside the brain. It is not the brain itself.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I would say that that is the more accurate way of speaking,
<br>
but people (that we would agree with) can hardly be blamed for
<br>
saying that computers feel or act when they mean the programs
<br>
in them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well this has been obvious for me for a long time. But what freaked me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out a bit, is that it is not the flesh that has conscience but the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'calculations' that is done in the flesh. And the flesh is only the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interface that allows us to experience the world.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And it is pretty hard to imagine mathematics that is self aware, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that must be the consequence.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't go that far.  We pious platonists believe (in the
<br>
very worst way that Brett Paatsch describes) that the mathematical
<br>
entities such as perfect triangles, the number seventeen, and all
<br>
other mathematical ideas exist in a timeless platonic space;  less
<br>
figuratively and more concretely I describe this as a set of real
<br>
constraints on possibilities in physical space.  (For example,
<br>
certain physical objects (computers) when set to methodically
<br>
detonate a bomb when they find solutions for x^n + y^n = z^n
<br>
for integers greater than two, will, it turns out, never explode.)
<br>
<p>But actual thoughts and feelings occur (I claim) only in
<br>
*processes*, that is, successive states of physical entities
<br>
in which information flows from one state to the next.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is what makes it so hard to grasp unintuitively that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence can take place there.  The [Chinese] room
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself is not what is alive to intelligent, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculations taking place on those paper pieces are.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's interesting that the latter makes so much
<br>
more sense to you that the former.  I doubt that
<br>
we disagree here, but I don't object to calling the
<br>
room itself a system that is intelligent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The room is just the interface with the world. A very bad interface. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence that could take place in those pieces of paper would have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor understanding of the world.
</em><br>
<p>Not sure that I understand you here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So the amusing thing is that, given enough time, it should be possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to run a program with a pencil, on a piece paper, that has intelligence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and conscience. If you stop writing the life ends and you kill your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'creature'.
</em><br>
<p>Quite so!  Or, better, you've just &quot;suspended&quot; your creature.
<br>
But if you wipe out the information necessary to resume the
<br>
computation, we then should say that then the creature has died.
<br>
In the most pristine form of talking, we should speak about
<br>
whether or not the entity gets run time.  If you kill it,
<br>
then, in our universe, it ceases to get run time nor (unless
<br>
Tipler is correct) will it ever again.  But as Hal Finney
<br>
pointed out not so long ago, we may rest assured that it
<br>
gets run time in other universes, provided that you join
<br>
the physicists who believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation,
<br>
and that that's right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This opens up for all kinds of opportunities for where life can exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It makes you wonder if life can suddenly come into spontaneous existence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the computations that is taking place on the net.  I cannot see why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not. Surely it cannot be a worse medium than atoms in water. Unless it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is too deterministic.
</em><br>
<p>I agree---at some point computer life over our internet (perhaps
<br>
later after it's thousands of times larger than now) may spontaneously
<br>
evolve.  But friends of mine have speculated that this may already
<br>
be true of *nations*.  One might argue (and they do) that nations
<br>
are already complex enough to support thought and feeling.  I demur.
