<p>Yeah. I think its real old. Like maybe ancient Greek sort
<br>
of old. But I'm not sure either. And because I'm not sure I
<br>
wonder if its significance has been fully appreciated. I 
<br>
wonder if it is an instance of a class of phenonenon that has
<br>
largely been neglected.
<br>
<p>For some reason I felt inclined to check out ternary logic
<br>
(tri-nary logic) via Google to see how ternary logic relates
<br>
to binary logic. I'm still messing and mulling but getting some
<br>
resonation.

<p>Thanks for pointing that out. I hadn't seen that side. Though there
<br>
does seem to be a certain aesthetic symmetry in having two 
<br>
answers. I note that one still can't tell whether they have spoken
<br>
to the liar or the truth teller but one still gets the necessary
<br>
information and one doesn't have to invert what one is told. 
<br>
Neat.
