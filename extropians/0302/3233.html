<p>Well, I know a powerful German executive who has recently
<br>
spoken of the Fourth Reich!
<br>
<p>Actually, he was a hippie in in 1960's so it's not *that*
<br>
kind of Reich.  But he's quite serious in that the 84 million
<br>
Germans have not yet reached their economic or political
<br>
apogee in Europe.
<br>
<p>The way that power politics *always* works out is that 
<br>
Europe feels a need (here I may be taken as speaking
<br>
either of its leaders and most influential people, or
<br>
about &quot;abstract&quot; Europe) to assert itself internationally.
<br>
<p>(Too long was Europe split, and overshadowed by the
<br>
U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A.  With a precedent going back
<br>
even much further than Charlemagne, the dissolution
<br>
of the bi-polar world urges Europe towards unity and
<br>
concomitant domination.)
<br>
<p>Still, &quot;Europe&quot; has to deal with the individual agendas
<br>
of its member nations, like &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Italy&quot;, or, 
<br>
maybe later certain unnamed Eastern European countries.
<br>
That's always been the case: were the American colonies
<br>
(including the Canadian ones) going to unite against
<br>
England or not?  You can never tell just how successful
<br>
(or desirable) coalitions are.
<br>
<p>But it would still be nice to hear about how it's going
<br>
in France itself.
<br>
<p>Lee
