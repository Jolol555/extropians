<p><p>I wouldn't be too worried about this.  First of all, urban areas are not 
<br>
the natural environment of a tank; the tanks long-range weapons are useless 
<br>
and it can't take advantage of cover very well.    Any tanks parked in 
<br>
places we know about, concentrated in towns won't be able to stop our tanks 
<br>
from driving to Baghdad in the wilderness around them.  Or we could just so 
<br>
round the towns and ask them to surrender.  If there are large casualties 
<br>
in the war, it will probably be in Baghdad.  We've seen Saddam use scorched 
<br>
earth tactics before, and he might (the army war college and popular wisdom 
<br>
disagree on this point) have used chemical weapons on his own people before.
