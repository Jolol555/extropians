<p>
<em>&gt; (I provide the above just as background for those interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and point out that because the Security Council met &quot;closed-door&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the two plans are not available for public viewing.
</em><br>
<p>The US/Britain/Spain draft resolution is posted at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.state.gov/p/io/rls/othr/17937.htm">http://www.state.gov/p/io/rls/othr/17937.htm</a>, and it just says:
<br>
<p>OP1: Decides that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity afforded 
<br>
to it in resolution 1441 (2002); 
<br>
<p>OP2: Decides to remain seized of the matter. 
<br>
<p>Here's an article which says that the Security Council must explicitly
<br>
authorize force against Iraq for an invasion to be legal:  
<br>
<a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=2880">http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=2880</a>
<br>
argues that just saying Iraq is in material breach isn't enough. It seems 
<br>
to me that the proposed U.S. resolution isn't really sufficient either.
<br>
<p>What do you think the consequences will be if the U.S. does decide to
<br>
breach the U.N. charter and invade Iraq without an explicit authorization 
<br>
from the Security Council? BTW, isn't the U.S. already in breach of the 
<br>
U.N. charter by enforcing the no-fly zones, which were never authorized by 
<br>
the Security Council? What about the 1989 Panama invasion, which was not 
<br>
authorized by the Security Council either?
<br>
<p>I haven't been able to find any amendments to the U.N. charter. Do 
<br>
any exist? For example has the Security Council chapter been amended to 
<br>
change one of the permanent members from the Soviet Union to Russia?
