<p>
Damien Broderick has written story which has a
<br>
skyhook being grown by a nanoreplicator.  As I
<br>
read the story, one of the many difficulties with
<br>
making an orbit-synchronous cable occurred to
<br>
me: that the cable would need to get an enormous
<br>
amount of angular momentum from somewhere in order
<br>
to keep one end pointed at the planet.
<br>
<p>Imagine a planet with a high-carbon satellite
<br>
conveniently located in synchronous orbit.  This
<br>
satellite is tidelocked to the planet, that is
<br>
the same face always points toward the planet.
<br>
So the sidereal rotation rate of the satellite
<br>
is one rev per &quot;day&quot;.
<br>
<p>Imagine nanobes on the satellite decide to build a
<br>
diamondoid cable down to the surface.  As they
<br>
do so, they manufacture and pay out cable into
<br>
space to maintain the CG at synchronous altitude.
<br>
<p>By the law of conservation of angular momentum,
<br>
the sidereal rotation rate of the satellite will
<br>
slow down as the moment of inertia of the satellite
<br>
goes up.  One can imagine that a completed cable/
<br>
satellite system would have a jillion times the
<br>
moment of inertia of the satellite without the
<br>
cable, so the sidereal rotation would have slowed
<br>
a jillionfold, so the cable is no longer synchronous.
<br>
The satellite still hangs in one spot over the
<br>
planet, but appears to be rotating about its
<br>
axis at about one revolution per day.
<br>
<p>One way to deal with this is to spin the satellite
<br>
at a jillion revs per day before the construction
<br>
begins, which presents its own practical difficulties.
<br>
<p>I wrote a paper once before about the problems
<br>
with making a geosynchronous cable, but I just
<br>
thought of this new one yesterday.
<br>
<p>Has anyone seen a study which deals with this
<br>
angular momentum problem?  Anders, Robert, have any
<br>
of you space cable fans recognized this problem?
