### I was even closer to Chernobyl when it happened - in southeastern
<br>
Poland. While of course I was angry at the communist regime for trying to
<br>
stall with informing the public, and I was appalled by the sloppiness shown
<br>
by Russians, I also know that most, if not all, of the &quot;losses&quot; of
<br>
agricultural produce outside Russia were due to ill-informed scaremongering,
<br>
rather than rational assessment of the situation. The amount of fallout was
<br>
minimal, well below level which can produce measurable health effects, most
<br>
of it in the form of short-lived isotopes, and therefore amenable to a
<br>
quarantine. The hysteria was fanned by the EU farmers, who saw imports from
<br>
the East as competition to their outrageously overpriced, heavily subsidized
<br>
produce.
<br>
<p>This said, nuclear power plants in the heavily populated Western Europe
<br>
would act as a force multiplier for any attacker or terrorist smart enough
<br>
to blow them up, so European reticence about placing them in (almost
<br>
literally) their backyards, is somewhat understandable.
