<p>It has never been my claim that selegiline is a cure for the disease, Rafal.
<br>
There is no cure for PD. Selegiline is merely a treatment for it. Once
<br>
diagnosed correctly with PD, the risk of dying from PD related causes is
<br>
basically 100 percent. So yes, of course there is no reduction in &quot;total
<br>
risk.&quot; But some studies do show an extension in lifespan in PD with
<br>
selegiline+levodopa vs levodopa alone.
<br>
<p>Many, many dozens of published studies state, suggest, or offer evidence of
<br>
the neuroprotective value of selegiline in PD. I'm amazed that you have not
<br>
done more research in medline into this area. The DATATOP abstract itself
<br>
begins to discuss the possible means by which selegiline is neuroprotective,
<br>
(which I notice that you have conveniently ignored), but in any case DATATOP
<br>
is not the only data available. In some studies selegiline does in fact
<br>
extend lifespan in PD patients, and it's certainly already done so in lab
<br>
animals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;As background: there was once a hypothesis that levodopa accelerates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;attrition of dopaminergic neurons, and that levodopa-sparing therapy would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;delay the onset of dyskinesias which usually develop after about 5-7 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;on levodopa, and perhaps prolong survival. A nice hypothesis, but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;true -substituting dopa-agonists or selegiline for levodopa in initial
</em><br>
treatment
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;does not delay the onset of dyskinesia. ...
</em><br>
<p>I think are mistaken here to include selegiline in the same class of drugs
<br>
as levodopa. Levodopa is merely a simple dopamine agonist -- actually it's
<br>
not even that -- it's merely an ordinary amino acid and a precursor to
<br>
dopamine. Selegiline's actions are far more complex and less well
<br>
understood.
<br>
<p>If you were really on top of this subject, Rafal, then I believe you and I
<br>
would not be arguing whether selegiline is neuroprotective. Instead we might
<br>
be arguing how and why it is neuroprotective. Several theories have been
<br>
advanced. For example it may protect neurons because it reduces the levels
<br>
of toxic by-products of MAO-B metabolism, or it may protect neurons because
<br>
it increases the levels of the natural antioxidants SOD and catalase. At
<br>
the moment I tend to support the latter theory.
<br>
<p>Below is yet another published study about selegiline and neuroprotection.
<br>
<p>In this abstract below, of a study published much more recently than
<br>
DATATOP, selegiline (deprenyl) was found to protect neurons from
<br>
free-radical damage in a dose dependent manner. It is suggested further that
<br>
the drug should be &quot;applicable to delay the deterioration of neurons during
<br>
advancing aging...&quot;

ABSTRACT:
Neuroprotection by deprenyl and related compounds

There is an increasing number of data by in vitro and in vivo experiments,
indicating that (-)-deprenyl is neuroprotective to dopamine neurons, even
though detailed mechanism remains to be clarified.  In this paper
neuroprotection by (-)-deprenyl and structurally related compounds was
examined in concern with the suppression of apoptosis induced by a reactive
oxygen species, peroxynitrite generated from SIN-1.  The apoptotic DNA
damage was quantitatively determined using dopaminergic SH-SYSY cells and by
a single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay.  DNA damage induced by
peroxynitrite was proved to be apoptotic by prevention of the damage by
cycloheximide or actinomycin-D. (-)-Deprenyl and other propargylamines
protected the cells from apoptosis in a dose-dependent way. (-)-Deprenyl
protected the cells even after it was washed out, suggesting that it may
initiate the intracellular process to repress the apoptotic death program.
The study on the structure-activity relationship of (-)-deprenyl analogues
revealed that a N-propargyl residue with adequate size of hydrophobic
structure is essentially required for the anti-apoptotic activity.  These
results suggest that (-)-deprenyl and related compounds may protect neurons
from apoptosis and be applicable to delay the deterioration of neurons
during advancing ageing and in neurodegenerative disorders.

I have spent literally years of life studying and following this drug
deprenyl (selegiline). I take a small dose of it every day, (with occasional
two week breaks), for anti-aging purposes, much in the same way that I take
my vitamins. I don't take prescription drugs lightly, but as someone
interested in anti-aging via any means (chemical or otherwise) I can tell
you that this drug is extremely interesting and very promising.
The only public relations black-eye the drug has ever suffered occurred a
few years ago, when an epidemiological study raised some concerns that
adding selegiline to l-dopa might increase rather than decrease mortality
rates in PD. However, as I've stated previously, subsequent metastudies have
removed those concerns and restored selegiline to its rightful place in PD
treatment. Other studies show that selegiline increases lifespan in animals
as well as human PD patients.
