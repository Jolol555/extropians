<p>
The recent discovery that sperm use temperature guidance or &quot;thermotaxis&quot; to
<br>
navigate the fallopian tubes and locate the egg[1] has led to a landmark
<br>
collaboration between Hughes Aircraft Corporation, makers of the AH-64D
<br>
&quot;Longbow&quot; Apache helicopter[2] and Organon, developer of the NuvaRing
<br>
Vaginal contraceptive device[3] to produce the first &quot;heat shielding
<br>
contraceptive capsule&quot; (HSCC).
<br>
<p>The birth control pill sized capsule makes use of gastrointestinal acoustics
<br>
as well as an undisclosed form of microfluidic propulsion to outpace the
<br>
sperm to the target egg whereupon it is mechanically enveloped. A series of
<br>
lateral vents are then employed to dissipate the egg's heat thereby
<br>
disguising it's IR signature and confounding the sperm's internal guidance
<br>
systems.
<br>
<p>A company insider at Organon claims that it's a design which has been on the
<br>
drawing boards for several of years but which has been delayed for lack of a
<br>
suitably small energy source  - a deficiency which has now been overcome[4].
<br>
Although the device is still in the field testing stage, engineers from both
<br>
companies are already collaborating with the Black Flag Corporation[5] to
<br>
develop a complimentary device which does not travel to the egg, but which
<br>
remains within the vagina radiating a comparatively large IR signature of
<br>
its own. It is hoped that the sperm will be attracted to this artificial IR
<br>
source which comprises numerous microscopic orifices through which the sperm
<br>
may only pass in one direction.
<br>
<p>Asked whether these revolutionary new devices will be able to economically
<br>
compete with more conventional forms of birth control, a Hughes Aircraft
<br>
spokesperson replied: &quot;The key issue is  perhaps not so much that these
<br>
devices will cost more, but the important scientific breakthroughs they
<br>
represent along with the projected commercial spin-offs we are likely to see
<br>
materializing over the course of the next few years.&quot;
