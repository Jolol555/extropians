</em><br>
<p>Yes. Here we follow the central directives of Socialstyrelsen (Ministry
<br>
of Social Health) and Läkemedelsverket (our FDA). Beside the extra
<br>
regulations imposed by other authorities. And since healthcare is
<br>
socialized (at least for major stuff like this) there is only one
<br>
provider. We are extremely free, I have been told by the government ;-)
<br>
<p>I think you misunderstood Rafals point: stem cell treatments are risky
<br>
and of unknown efficacy right now.  That doesn't mean they aren't
<br>
worthwhile to try for some people, but one shouldn't get one's hopes up
<br>
too much right now. There are other treatments that have shown great
<br>
promise such as brain pacemakers or even pallidotomy. Right now the
<br>
demand for treatments outstrips the supply, simply because it is highly
<br>
experimental, stem cells are hard to come by and the technique is
<br>
tricky. Once it is proven and the wrinkles come out it will no doubt
<br>
become far more common. Until then it is very much that patients are
<br>
selected by researchers.
<br>
<p>I listened to one of the researchers lecture in a neuroscience course I
<br>
attended, and it sounded promising but also rather primitive at present
<br>
(the sheer *size* of that screw they used to lodge the stem cells in the
<br>
basal ganglia! Ouch!).
