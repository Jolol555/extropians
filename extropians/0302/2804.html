<em>&gt; In the debate about the Fermi paradox Dennis May has

</em><br>
<p>I've also cross-posted your response back to Star_Ship forum to keep the
<br>
discussion going.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If you give yourself away to humans there is some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; chance you are giving yourself away to many other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; groups as well.  An advanced group might be aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that humans are a single breakthrough away from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; regular space travel and WoMD which cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; guarded against.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I consider all this quite silly.  Civilizations that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach approximately our level of achievement, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes merely a million years from the animal state,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly undergo some sort of singularity and expand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to encompass all solar systems in their galaxy.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires far less than one additional million years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So all told, we are talking about it taking less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two million years for an animal to conquer a galaxy.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not so sure I consider it silly.  You are accepting one of the
<br>
premises of May's argument: any two civilizations would eventually
<br>
become rivals for the same resources.  So, coexistence is not
<br>
possible -- or, at least, one can't assume another civilization will
<br>
want coexistence even if yours wants it.  The next point to be made
<br>
would be how does one prevent oneself from being destroyed or overcome.
<br>
May believes nomadism combined with stealth would be the answer.  This
<br>
way you don't draw the attention of current or future enemies.  (Also,
<br>
you might advance your own weapons and technology in the interim being
<br>
more ready for conflict should it come in the future.  A more
<br>
destructive/aggressive civilization might adopt the strategy of just
<br>
pre-empting all potential rivals.  A more peaceful one would be absorbed
<br>
and not be around to tell about it.  This all within May's model.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These arguments are bolstered to a rather definitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree IMO in Frank Tipler's &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Barrow and Tipler's &quot;The Cosmic Anthropological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Principle&quot;.  He points out that using &quot;Von Neumann probes&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a civilization converts the remaining part of its galaxy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to its own tissue (my words) in a geological eye-blink.
</em><br>
<p>This, however, would tend to support the idea that civilizations would
<br>
want to stop each other -- though likely the differences in
<br>
technological levels would make this an unequal battle with the more
<br>
advanced civilization destroying or absorbing the less advanced one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Talk about &quot;advanced ETI's&quot; somehow remaining aloof
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from our planet is merely emotionally appealing SF.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;There aren't any&quot;; that's the answer to the Fermi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.
</em><br>
<p>I tend to agree with the last point:  There are no ETIs yet.
<br>
<p>I also think that absent centralized control -- as would happen with a
<br>
civilization expanding into space -- there would be some chatter and
<br>
we'd have picked it up by now if they were such a civilization active in
<br>
our galaxy.  So, again, I accept the null hypothesis here.
<br>
<p>(But darn if Smart's transcension model doesn't entice me.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
