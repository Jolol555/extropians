#The Executive Branch, The Legislative, Judical, Pentagon, and perhaps 
<br>
350,000 residents of DC, Virginia, Maryland; all gone in a flash.
<br>
<p>Guess1: It would take months to establish some kind of government, probably 
<br>
military in nature, to maintain order, ensure command and control of nuclear 
<br>
warhead missles, submarines, etc.
<br>
<p>Guess1a) This might never occur in the face of a national insurrection
<br>
<p>Guess2: There would be a world-wide economic depression, as a result of the 
<br>
slowness of any kind of temporary or permanent government to take command. 
<br>
See Guess1, and refer to Guess1a for the reasons for a much longer economic 
<br>
depression.
<br>
<p>Guess2a) The ceasing of Social Security payments, entitlements, the physical 
<br>
destruction of DC records would also halt payments to State and city 
<br>
Governments; and thus ensure a depression happens.
<br>
<p>Guess3a) The possible fracturing of the US into geographic, religious, 
<br>
ideological, and race/ethic territories, would likely cause:
<br>
<p>a) cessation of trade with China, Japan, South Korea.
<br>
b) These states would likely then cease purchase from Europe.
<br>
<p>Guess4) China and Russia might negotiate spheres of influence, and perhaps 
<br>
seeing when the aquistion of American territory might be venturable. 
<br>
<p>Guess4a) Australia and New Zealand capitulating, as well as Japan, South 
<br>
Korea, and South East Asian under The New Chinese Hegemony
<br>
<p>The Former Soviet Union now establishing itself as nominal leader of the EU, 
<br>
or rather military leader. Read Russian hegemony. A new Russian Empire
<br>
<p>5)Allah has judged the Crusader! Now to liberate Al Quds from the Jews. 
<br>
Resulting in Israel using nuclear weapons against the newly energized 
<br>
Arab-Islamic movement.  What would result is not clear. Beyond many dead, 
<br>
that is. 
<br>
<p>6) Pakistan and India might stay out of this global mess, perhaps until the 
<br>
dust clears. Maybe they would get dragged in?
<br>
<p>There are other scenarios and and other games to play with such scenarios. 
<br>
The lesson to be learned may not be clear except that you may hate the USA, 
<br>
but it may not be until your great grandchildrens' adulthood, before most 
<br>
nations will experience the liberty we enjoy now.
