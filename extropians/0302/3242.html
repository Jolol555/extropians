<em>&gt; &gt; I've never read in a history book of an invaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; land...and I mean close enough proximity to see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where people were holding a peace protest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not scrambling for their lives.  Am I wrong?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Athens in the Peloponnesian War:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While Spartan forces were marauding the countryside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around Athens, the asshole Socrates and others were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying everything pro-Sparta that they could think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of.  A certain playwright was advocating peace and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disarmament in his theatrical productions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The worst crime of it was that a number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were listening to Socrates, and applauding those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productions, and this at a time when Spartan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tyranny was well-known.  So next time some loony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leftist seems to be going beyond all reason, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember that so did &quot;the wisest of them all&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alas, some people's emotions, healthy prejudices,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and natural human common sense are simply broken.

<p>There are a number of people in this debate who pretend to be
<br>
undecided about the issue, but clearly are pro-war. For the 
<br>
record, I'm extremely anti-war (hopefully that's not news).
<br>
Apart from anything else, Australia has been involved in far
<br>
too many wars of dubious merit (actually, downright stupid is
<br>
probably the best descriptor - gallipoli, vietnam, boer war? 
<br>
probably lots of others but I'm no war buff).
