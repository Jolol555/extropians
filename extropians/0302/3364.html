<em>&gt; &gt; Hal posted about &quot;stealth democracy&quot; and the researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; he quoted had me pegged pretty well: I wouldn't make (myself)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a great study of policy issues confronting my country, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather trust people whose ideology is close to mine, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who are presumably paid professionals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am sure many people in many aggressor nations and budding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fascist states said the same thing at some critical points in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history.  How is this different from leaving the moral questions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the hands of those paid to consider them?  What does that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make you?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, well, moral questions are something else altogether.
<br>
Consider the Bush administration's continuation of the
<br>
earlier administrations' War on Drugs, or consider their
<br>
take on cloning or abortion.  Naturally I disagree with
<br>
that.  But if they are such professionals, you are
<br>
probably wondering how it is that I can disagree with
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>After all, it's their job to think about such things,
<br>
and they have the advice of hundreds of medically
<br>
gifted people, and so on.
<br>
<p>Well, whenever I get a whiff of ideology, then I know
<br>
that merely acquisition of knowledge isn't sufficient:
<br>
(It's necessary, but not sufficient.)  I totally disagree
<br>
with the Bush administration about drugs and abortion
<br>
because I'm on the other side of an ideological divide
<br>
from them.
<br>
<p>When I spoke above of leaving &quot;policy issues in the
<br>
hands of professions&quot;, I'm sorry that I didn't make
<br>
this clear, and you were right to call me on it.
<br>
<p>What I do leave to them is---given that they have my
<br>
ideology---the intricate and deep issues of strategy.
<br>
For example, what should be the U.S. stance towards
<br>
Pakistan?  On the one hand, we must question and
<br>
criticize many things that go on there---but would
<br>
such criticism do more good or harm there, given the
<br>
details of the situation?
<br>
<p>Frankly, I am disappointed in people who only have
<br>
knee-jerk reactions to injustice.  It's as if they
<br>
never think of the difficulties involved.  It's 
<br>
almost as if they never heard of the idea of &quot;the
<br>
lesser of evils&quot;.  I have been aware of that idea
<br>
since I was twelve years old, and, more importantly,
<br>
keep *acting* on it.  Sometimes it---choke---is even
<br>
necessary to praise an evil, as hard as this is to
<br>
do, if it truly means preventing an even greater
<br>
evil.
<br>
<p>Naturally, all this is extremely complicated to try
<br>
to figure out.  Observe the complex scenarios discussed
<br>
by Max Plumm and Kai Becker:  trying to calculate what
<br>
would happen if the Shah of Iran were to lose power---
<br>
would it result that the people were more free of
<br>
tyranny, or would a Communist or Muslim religious
<br>
fanatic regime impose even greater tyranny?  Once
<br>
you have found the professionals with whom you agree
<br>
on an intellectual, a moral, and an ideological basis,
<br>
you MUST leave such questions to them.
<br>
<p>I understand the motivation for protesting in the
<br>
streets---you seek to weaken the power of your
<br>
ideological adversaries.  I do not understand an
<br>
inability to *understand* arguments based upon the
<br>
lesser of two evils.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Were you napping
</em><br>
<p>You and Mike Lorrey must derive great emotional
<br>
satisfaction from starting sentences like this ;-)
<br>
But that's okay..., it's entertaining!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; when Bush declared it as US doctrine that we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preemptively strike anywhere on Earth we feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threatened?
</em><br>
<p>In the context of what he meant, I totally approve.
<br>
How &quot;threatening&quot; is threatened?  I'm sure that you
<br>
would be the first, were you a part of some presidential
<br>
administration, to advocate instant and unilateral
<br>
action if intelligence people that you trusted said
<br>
that bio-scientists in Mexico City had just created a
<br>
plague that would finish all life on Earth, and it
<br>
was about to get out!  George Bush meant, for example,
<br>
if a *real* threat developed, he would not wait one
<br>
second for all these U.N. decrees, and permission
<br>
from Cameroon (no joke).
