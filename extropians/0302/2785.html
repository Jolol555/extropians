<p>
I was all warmed up today to do some serious debunking of
<br>
bad ideas, and sure enough, a few posts offered up some
<br>
choice pickings.  But no sooner ON AT LEAST THREE OCCASIONS
<br>
had I decided to shoot down a serious misconception or faulty
<br>
idea than I found that someone had beat me to it.
<br>
<p>Part of my enjoyment of this list comes from refuting
<br>
either improperly thought-out ideas, or notions at odds
<br>
with extropian insights and thinking.  But days like today
<br>
leave me little to do in this area, when I come late to
<br>
looking over the posts, and I was thinking that perhaps
<br>
some of us who have earned our spurs should be left with
<br>
at least a little in the way of bad arguments to refute.
<br>
<p>Now I am reduced to only a paltry ideological attack
<br>
on someone's position, or to meekly pointing out that 
<br>
certain things are not so simple as first appear.  Well,
<br>
I guess I should be grateful.  But I don't feel that way.
<br>
Sigh.  ;-)   I am made to feel superfluous.
<br>
<p>Lee
