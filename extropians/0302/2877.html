### I have been thinking about this issue for a long time. It sounds very
<br>
attractive, to have private, competing highway systems. One thing bugs me
<br>
however - the acquisition of the land for roads would be quite difficult.
<br>
You couldn't use eminent domain (or could you?). A single holdout on the
<br>
path of a planned highway could demand a lot of cash, or scuttle the project
<br>
altogether (e.g., the owner of a mountain pass). This would drive up the
<br>
prices. Also, in certain situations, if the ownership of roads in an area
<br>
became concentrated in one hand, there would be the risk of monopoly rents
<br>
being extracted from the citizens.
<br>
<p>How could you solve these problems?
<br>
<p>I was thinking about using the mechanism of hostile buyout of land. Let's
<br>
say, the local protection provider will accept a request to organize an
<br>
auction for any real estate from a party, against the wishes of the current
<br>
occupant. The requestor, however, has to pay a set premium over the final
<br>
auction price if he wants to actually buy it (e.g. double the previous
<br>
offer). If the property is sold for a price, the requestor has to pay some
<br>
fraction of this amount of money as fee for the auction, and can only buy
<br>
the property from the new owner at a premium (e.g. double the auction sale
<br>
price, with part of the premium going to the original owner, and part to the
<br>
buyer). In this way, the original owner is assured a premium over the market
<br>
price for his land, but the price itself can only with difficulty be subject
<br>
to speculation based on the intended use of the land. The requestor has to
<br>
pay to request the auction, so he cannot play games. The buyer can pocket
<br>
part of the premium, just as the original owner but in case he overpays and
<br>
the roadbuilder changes his mind, the buyer is stuck with a piece of useless
<br>
(for him) property, discouraging speculation. Collusion would be difficult
<br>
and honest dealing between the original owner and the roadbuilder would be
<br>
cheaper, eliminating the auction in most cases, I think.
<br>
<p>Additional considerations pertain to land with improvements.
<br>
<p>Sounds very complicated but so far it's the only solution without eminent
<br>
domain I could come up with.
