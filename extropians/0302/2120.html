<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Such a cycle would have to process the high-level waste as fast as it

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I haven't seen any serious calculation that takes all this into account 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and comes up with a positive sum.
</em><br>
<p>Argonne Labs here, had its IFR (Integral Fast Reactor) program almost ready 
<br>
for a commercial scale test when our beloved Bill Clinton axed the program. 
<br>
They ended up spending more to scrap the works than the budget to finish 
<br>
the testing. The reactor essentially had a robotic recycling facility built 
<br>
into the containment that separated the wastes from Pu and U fuel, 
<br>
reinstalled the fuel in the reactor, and the wastes in a blanket around the 
<br>
vessel. The design was such that it was fueled once, run for 30 or 40 
<br>
years, then sealed in place for the low-level remaining wastes to decay - 
<br>
say another 30 or 40 years, then decommissioned. I read on this list 
<br>
recently about a similar system - can't grab the post right now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;but the glass itself needs to be stored away from inquisitive persons...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;... not only persons, but also natural forces like earth quakes, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Which is why many of us here have been questioning the wisdom of &quot;Yucca 
<br>
Mountain&quot;, our high-level waste disposal site. Worse, Clinton planned to 
<br>
put Pu from spent fuel in there, rather than burning it up in a mixed-oxide 
<br>
system - even Pu from ex-Soviet warheads that we were buying up at the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And can we assure that this technology, power plants and such, will always 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be properly maintained and in the hand of responsible persons? There're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dozens of nuclear driven ships and subs of the FSU rotting in their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;habors. Many power stations are also rotten and only hold together with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;duct tape. Or what about a civil war in China, Japan, Africa or South 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;America, e.g. Brazil? The &quot;human factor&quot; is an incalculable risk in this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equation.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;FSU&quot; (good acronym!) has a multitude of sins to answer for - but I 
<br>
believe that in a free market, power plants would be built responsibly and 
<br>
run responsibly - because to do otherwise would ruin the profits. Only in a 
<br>
micro-managed system like our NRC can slipshod systems get by here - it's 
<br>
more &quot;economical&quot; to cheat knowing the bureaucracy won't catch up, and many 
<br>
of the record-keeping requirements are truly Byzantine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;The only way to eliminate the heat load of technology on the surface of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the planet is to eliminate the technology - something that is dear to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;hearts of too many enviro-wackos out there.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I'll think of fission power as a safe technology, as soon as someone shows 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me an effective method to stop radioactive decay or some device to bring 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tons of radioactive waste to a place _really_ outside our biosphere. Until 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then, the remaining risks are too high for my personal measure of safety. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If that makes me an &quot;enviro-wacko&quot; in your eyes, I'll  return this with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;friendly &quot;techno-loony&quot; :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Kai
</em><br>
<p>Not a loony, simply a knowledgeable, concerned person who lives a whole lot 
<br>
closer to Chernobyl than I do..
<br>
(I was upwind of TMI, too...)
<br>
<p>Personally, I vote for nuclear until we can get workable orbiting solar up 
<br>
and on the grids - then scrap all the old tech, except for a museum piece 
<br>
or two. Even counting the FSU, nuclear has a better record of not killing 
<br>
people than fossil fuel plants.
