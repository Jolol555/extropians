<p>He had plenty other cringeworthy things to say, but this one popped 
<br>
my bogometer's fuse so hard that it set off my apartment's smoke detector:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;
<br>
Gates argues that starting from scratch doesn't make software more secure. 
<br>
``Evolution has never started over,'' he said. ``So the best programming 
<br>
process known built upon its earlier work every step of the way.''
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Quiz: is Bill Gates:
<br>
<p>A. making a subtle genius-type joke that the reporter failed to catch
<br>
B. monstrously stupid, to the point that he is endangering shareholder value 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each minute that he retains his position as Microsoft Chief Architect
<br>
C. utterly morally bankrupt
<br>
D. in desperate need of having his prescriptions adjusted
<br>
E. some of the above
<br>
F. all of the above
<br>
<p>Next week, Bill Gates will explain why rubbish heaps are actually superior 
<br>
to art galleries, because nothing is ever thrown out of a rubbish heap. 
<br>
&quot;They're the sum total of our civilization&quot;, sources report he will say.
