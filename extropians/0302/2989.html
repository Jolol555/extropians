Emilyn quipped:
<br>
&lt;&lt;You say that like you think the Axis of Evil exists.
<br>
<p>Emlyn&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>David Frum, who wrote much of W's speech, originally had the phrase &quot;axis of 
<br>
hatred&quot;, but George changed it to axis of evil.  The Clinton administration, 
<br>
in all its phases was aware of the genie getting out of the box, in so many 
<br>
countries that were and are ant-American, plus anti-democratic, plus 
<br>
pro-active in their aggressions, plus spending large sums to arm themselves 
<br>
with WMD's and the means to deliver them.
<br>
It was a matter of how to deal with such nations. 
<br>
<p>Actually it was a matter of identifying publically such countries, and then 
<br>
what to do about them. Clinton, in North Korea, tried bribery. Clinton and 
<br>
Bush, in the case of Iraq, tried air-strikes. Clinton also tried hoping the 
<br>
problem will go away, hence 9-11 occuring. Protestors focus on W's &quot;perfidy&quot; 
<br>
and ignore the Saddam regime. You act as if this guy is a minor player.
