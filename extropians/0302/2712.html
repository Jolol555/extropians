<p><em>&gt; One point of the above essay is that the positive 'stories' come not

<p>To which I would like to add some words of the American physicist J. Richard
<br>
Gott. In his latest book &quot;Time Travel in Einstein's Universe&quot; he compares
<br>
the Egyptian pyramids with the Saturn V. There has been a comparatively
<br>
small time window in Egyptian history when the efforts to build such
<br>
incredible artefacts were successful. After that it was never attempted
<br>
again.
<br>
<p>The same seems to apply to the Apollo programm of the NASA with the Saturn V
<br>
rocket as a contemporary Cheop's pyramid. The time window for building such
<br>
roaring vehicles seems to be shut already, leaving the window for space
<br>
migration ajar for only a tiny amount of years in the late 1960's and
<br>
1970's.Gott fears that the efforts for space migration of the human race
<br>
will cease with each passing year and that Saturn V. has already become a
<br>
modern myth, an admirable piece of architecture, but never to be built
<br>
again, being useless like the pyramids.
