<p>Greg, I suspect lightweight pickups and SUVs are on the
<br>
way, even front wheel drive models, which should improve
<br>
fuel economy.  There are other reasons besides the security
<br>
aspect that give trucks and SUVs appeal, altho that probably
<br>
is most of it.  Part of what accounts for their popularity
<br>
may be the more upright seating posture.  This has its cost
<br>
in wind resistance, but as you pointed out, most drivers
<br>
live in the city, where top speeds are generally low, so
<br>
wind resistance is not that much of an issue.
<br>
<p>A few years ago a friend borrowed my truck and loaned
<br>
me her Pontiac Fiero.  I had the best handling fastest
<br>
little hotrod around for a few days.  I hated the thing.
<br>
Sure I could tear around town like my ass was on fire,
<br>
and yes that was fun, but the way down seating posture
<br>
was uncomfortable, it was hard to get in and out of,
<br>
inducing claustrophobia.  It wouldn't work for your
<br>
grandmother.
<br>
<p>Also at the stoplights I felt like a cockroach down there.
<br>
Now, of course, I *like* cockroaches, but still.
<br>
<p>Smaller, more economical cars will eventually become the
<br>
norm again, but we can be sure it won't happen while gas
<br>
is as cheap as it is.  And in this country at least, we
<br>
will unceremoniously hurl out of office anyone who
<br>
threatens to tax up the price of fuel.  This isn't a
<br>
comment about policy, rather a sure prediction of voter
<br>
behavior.
