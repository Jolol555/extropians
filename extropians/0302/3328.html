If you tend to use the same username/password in a lot of place 
<br>
then it is not particularly likely that said username/password 
<br>
was obtained by key-logging or other hacks on your machine.  It 
<br>
is more likely that it was obtained by any site you used it on 
<br>
that is a bit lax with the security of such user credentials. 
<br>
Then the offender could simply try it in other places where you 
<br>
have been seen on the Net.
<br>
<p>It is not terribly difficult to keylog Windows machines.  They 
<br>
are a lot of tools sold commercially for doing this and Windows 
<br>
does not easily lend itself to security methods against this 
<br>
sort of activity.  Some commercial software has actually been 
<br>
detected to include a hidden keylogger.
<br>
<p>Windows XP???  Microsoft also reserves the right to read over 
<br>
your shoulder whenever it likes!   :-)

<em>&gt; Normally I use this extropian forum to debate and pontificate about

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suddenly however I find myself feeling helpless and ignorant about an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important subject: computer keylogging and surveillance software. I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hoping some of the expert hackers here can offer some advice to help me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a rather upsetting situation. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It appears that my personal home PC has been hacked. Someone unbeknownst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me has discovered the password and email address that I once used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logon to a particular website. This person then impersonated me on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant site and used the resulting record of my activity in an effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to disrupt my personal life in a very destructive way. I have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence so far that this person is not also seeking to disrupt my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; financial or professional life. I use pretty much the same email and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; password for everything, though I have already rushed to change the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critical passwords in the wake of this incident. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My PC is generally not physically accessible to anyone other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself. My first guess therefore is that my security was compromised by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some kind of remote installation stealth keylogging software capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gathering my password information and transmitting back to the sender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the internet. It's my understanding that it is possible to install
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keylogging and screenshot copying software remotely via email
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attachments, attachments which would then, if executed, start sending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data secretly to the original sender via unseen email. Normally I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; careful to refrain from opening email attachments from strangers, (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know enough to protect myself against common email worms and viruses),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but in this case there is every reason to believe that the culprit was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no stranger. The primary suspect in my mind is one of a handful spiteful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and potentially treacherous ex-girlfriends who may now be trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sabotage my current relationship, and who might also possibly be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in doing financial or professional damage to my life as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As the saying goes, &quot;hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.&quot; And I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dated some very intelligent and computer savvy women in recent years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of whom might very well be feeling scorned. :/ (In fact the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely culprit knows of my membership here and might very well be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading these very words as I write or publish them. If so then so be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it! She might just as well know right now that I have every intention to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go after her ass with a vengeance. If possible I will press legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charges.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am running Windows XP Home Edition. Until a couple of week ago I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connected 24/7 via DSL, but in the last few weeks I have been using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dialup only. Normally I keep McAfee Firewall running, but I cannot say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with certainty that I have not manually allowed a suspect program access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the internet (that imo is a serious problem with these personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firewall programs... It's difficult for regular folks to know a bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program from a good one unless the app name is obviously familiar).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today, in an effort to find stealth keylogging programs, I installed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ran a trial copy of Anti-Keylogger, published by Raytown Corporation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anti-Keylogger identified these files as suspect on my XP system:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   -  c:\windows\system32\wbem\repository\fs\index.btr
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   -  c:\windows\system32\wbem\repository\fs\objects.map.new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   -  c:\windows\system32\wbem\repository\fs\index.map.new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   -  c:\windows\system32\wbem\repository\fs\objects.data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can anyone tell me if these files are in fact evidence of malicious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keylogging? Their location under windows/system32 leads me think they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are innocent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also I installed and ran a trial version of SpyCop version 5.2c. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trial version of the software found nothing suspicious, but according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the literature the trial software does not check every file. Is this a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program worth purchasing? If not, what anti-computer surveillance apps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should I consider? Note that these applications are in a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; category from anti-virus software. I already run anti-virus software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from McAffee, along with their firewall and anti-spam software.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In what other ways might someone gain access to my password and logon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information to impersonate me at a particular web site, short of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical access to my PC? Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.
</em><br>
