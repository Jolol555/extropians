</em><br>
<p>Sorry but as I said I just don't answer those kinds of questions! :-)
<br>
<p>The irony here is that I am really no dummy about software and computer
<br>
security. In fact I am a Microsoft Certified Visual C++ Product
<br>
Developer who once wrote a Windows front end for an old DOS version of
<br>
PGP. I'm no longer in the software business but I do know more than the
<br>
average bear about these subjects. If you did a google search on my full
<br>
real name (which for security reasons I no longer make easily available
<br>
in online communications) you would find me offering some interesting
<br>
discussion some years ago about a beta product designed to automate PGP,
<br>
and perhaps also find discussion by me about other security and
<br>
encryption products. At one time I even published a website designed to
<br>
help people ensure the security of their computers! Unfortunately that
<br>
was back in about 1997 (eons ago in hacking years), and I'm no longer in
<br>
the software business. In those days I'm not sure one could even send an
<br>
HTML email without attracting attention, if it was possible at all. And
<br>
since those days I've gotten a bit lax about my own security (how
<br>
embarrassing). I've been too busy with other projects to keep up with
<br>
developments in this area. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you mean by &quot;generally&quot;?  How often is your PC physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; accessible to someone else?  Once a week?  Once a month?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Basically, never. I can't think of a time that anyone had access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this computer without my close supervision, which is not to say it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; never happened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even under close supervision, if someone else was using your computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and went to a malicious site that'd drop a quiet in-the-background
</em><br>
<em>&gt; installer of a keylogger, do you think you'd be able to (1) know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to spot it happening, (2) be quick enough to catch it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening? 
</em><br>
<p>You'll just have to trust me on this: it would be a huge surprise to me
<br>
find out that 
<br>
anyone has ever physically accessed my PC in this way without my
<br>
knowledge. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I knew more about your life, would I be able to guess your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; password? 
</em><br>
<p>Very, very doubtful. You would need to be almost telepathic. This
<br>
low-security password of mine was discovered by someone in text form via
<br>
hacking, or by social engineering, (or perhaps over the shoulder, but
<br>
very unlikely). My best hope is that it was not discovered via any kind
<br>
of keylogging Trojan software, since this would mean my high-security
<br>
password was almost certainly not compromised. This is why I am so keen
<br>
on the idea of eliminating that possibility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Actually I do. I'm set up to automatically download and install
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; every [XP] patch. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm too paranoid to do that -- I'm still waiting for someone to 0wn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft Windows Update and widely distribute a backdoor/Trojan from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft's own servers.
</em><br>
<p>Well I will admit this much to you: despite my former affiliation with
<br>
MS, I have decided because of this security breach to eliminate all
<br>
dependence on MS for internet purposes. I've been using MSIE and Outlook
<br>
Express and Outlook XP, while hoping that my McAfee firewall and virus
<br>
software would protect me from their deficiencies, but I am no longer
<br>
convinced that anyone is really capable of protecting these MS apps.
<br>
They will be gone from my computer in short order, as soon as I can
<br>
decide on suitable replacements. I'm going to dissolve the damned
<br>
Microsoft CD's in acid so that I am no longer tempted to use them. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; I've had several different user accounts on my own PC over several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; different installations, each one a renamed admin account. One of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; them used the same password as that used on the hacked site. Stealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; software capable of recovering that owner password would have helped
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the hacker. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did you disable the Guest account?  If not, remotely someone could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have grabbed the appropriate file on your drive that contains the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passwords, and as you mention, go through the process of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; password-recovery of it. 
</em><br>
<p>The guest account is currently disabled, but I can't say for certain
<br>
that I disabled it immediately upon my last installation or upon my
<br>
previous installation. So that's a possibility. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm betting that the password was not a random sequence of letters and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers, and was probably a mnemonic of some sort, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceivably guessable given enough knowledge about you and the kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thing you may choose as a password.  A few very pointed (but still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benign) questions might be enough to reveal it.
</em><br>
<p>I dare you to try formulating those few pointed questions. ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You sound like a person who thinks they have something worth hiding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What could you possibly be protecting that's worth losing sleep over?
</em><br>
<p>If I answered that question then I would have to kill you. Lol. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm waiting for people to set up high-powered telescopes aimed at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public ATM keypads from a distance to surf people's PIN codes as well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a glance at their ATM card to get their account number, then see if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're signed up for web banking then *slurrrrrrrrrp* run off with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their money.  I cannot believe it hasn't happened yet, especially in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places like New York City.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Thanks for all your advice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Free advice is worth exactly what you paid for it.  :-)
</em><br>
<p>:-)
