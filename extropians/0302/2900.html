</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Meanwhile the people ask, &quot;Is it really true?&quot;, so often

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;What people anywhere would fail to be elated that their country

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those who oppose Saddam and wish for a regime change.  How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much they *personally* fear the kind of war that'll happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must surely vary a lot from person to person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I doubt very much that those who want a regime change within 
<br>
Iraq are overly given to wanting an invasion of foreign troops 
<br>
and in the main determination by foreign countries of what the 
<br>
new government and its leader should be.  I doubt many of them 
<br>
believe that further destruction of the countries infrastructure 
<br>
and further death of its citizens is the best way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Exactly how is this bad news or something that should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;dismay those of us who point out that there is no good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;reason for this proposed war?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm surprised that I should have to spell it out.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that merely shows how each of us finds the viewpoints
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and arguments of others comparatively alien.  You do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grant the possibility (though I expect you to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it somewhat less probable?) that the uniform pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the armed might of the world might cause him to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept one of the deals that is talked about, and just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abdicate?  Surely if he knew that it was a certainty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he was going to be captured by the allies, he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be more likely to choose exile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I do not think we are just positioning to get Saddam to stand 
<br>
down in the least.  I find your argument spurious.  Also I don't 
<br>
believe it is a legitimate tool of diplomacy or reasonable 
<br>
international relations to threaten a country with emminent 
<br>
invasion and mayhem unless it changes its leadership to suit you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;So while the effect of the demonstrations on the Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;administration and its allies will be minimal, of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;we can expect that any thoughts Saddam Hussein has of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;abdicating or to destroying his WMD are put on hold.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Alleged WMD.  We have no proof.  Zero, Nada.  No reason that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;stands scrutiny has been given for the carnage and cost, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;immediate and likely consequent, of this proposed action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All the news reports and discussions I've seen refer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a number of WMD that he had in 1996, and for which he has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failed to account.  What do you think happened to them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>They allege various things but where the hell is the beef? 
<br>
These allegations, even if all true which is extremely doubtful, 
<br>
would still be insufficient for the proposed action and the 
<br>
likely results.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;This resembles ever so much the Vietnam debacle a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;generation ago, the main difference being that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;addition to the encouragement and support given to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;the murderous Hanoi regime, western politicians were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;deeply affected by the demonstrations and protests
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;as the years went by.  At least this time there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;will not follow such tragic consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;If western politicians do not heed the cry of the people the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;consequences will be tragic indeed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, we have you on record as predicting that.   I'll go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on record as predicting that the deaths of Western soldiers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be less than a thousand, and that because of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficulty that capturing Baghdad poses.  It is said that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sectors of the city will be so willing to depose Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the first things that arriving troops should do is pass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out pistols.  Other areas are known to be quite loyal to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hussein.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The tragic consequences include the consequences to so-called 
<br>
democracies of ignorning and overriding the voices of their own 
<br>
people.  There are many other negative consequences of the 
<br>
proposed action, both planned consequences and likely ones.  But 
<br>
I was principally referring to the damage done to democracies by 
<br>
&quot;leaders&quot; callously dimissing the wishes of the people.  I am 
<br>
surprised I had to spell that out to you.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As for the deaths of Iraqi soldiers and civilians, as General
</em><br>
<em>&gt; McCafferty (or McCaffrey) said, there's little telling.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected that the Allied propaganda leaflets already dropped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will cause the main Iraqi army units to surrender quickly, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the Republican Guard units will not.  Civilian casualties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be almost entirely limited to Baghdad, and will be much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than in other wars in which a capital city was conquered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (e.g. Berlin) because of modern capabilities---no block by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; block, street by street fighting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So our unwarranted act of agression is something you think we 
<br>
can &quot;get away with&quot; with relatively low body count so we should 
<br>
proceed?   May history have mercy on such attitudes.
