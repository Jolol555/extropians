</em><br>
<p>It is interesting to analyse the rhetoric here. I guess it is 
<br>
best done in the original wording, but &quot;crimes against the human 
<br>
species&quot; does ring plenty of warning bells. If it had just been 
<br>
crimes against humanity the construction would have been somewhat 
<br>
in line with current legislative wording and the kind of 
<br>
declarations we have seen from the UN and Europa Commission. But 
<br>
adding &quot;species&quot; brings in a very ugly biologism, and seems to 
<br>
resonate with earlier &quot;crimes against the race&quot;. The problem here 
<br>
(just as in many of the less malign crimes against humanity 
<br>
claims against cloning) is that an abstraction - humanity or the 
<br>
species - is placed under protection against the interests and 
<br>
happiness of real, existing humans. It is the 
<br>
collectivist/Platonist fallacy all over again. It opens up for 
<br>
the worrying possibility that many other activities also could 
<br>
become crimes against the species. If this type of law is passed, 
<br>
then transhumanism is in very real trouble (but also will get the 
<br>
chance to defend itself in court - sufficiently well-publicized 
<br>
cases can do wonders with public opinion). 
<br>
<p>I seem to recall that France has relatively strict rules against
<br>
&quot;sects&quot;, with somewhat arbitrary enforcement? Overall the above
<br>
amendement seems directed specifically against the Raelians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I had a booklet in project about the topic (I am preparing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collection of booklets, each one offering food for thought about one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future-oriented topic); I guess it may, within a few days, become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illegal to publish it.
</em><br>
<p>So it might be useful to have it published beforehand, 
<br>
grandfathering it. 
<br>
<p>I wonder about the application of the law against francophone
<br>
pro-cloning material elsewhere. The Yahoo case seem to duggest
<br>
that at least some French courts claim the right to limit access
<br>
to unsuitable materials abroad, and I wonder about whether the
<br>
new extradition rules applies to this law. Overall, it may have a 
<br>
chilling effect on the debate, and represents a dangerous step 
<br>
that should be opposed firmly and loudly.
