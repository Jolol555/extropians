<br>
necessary, we will need to reconstruct Iraq massively, but there seems to be 
<br>
no program for doing this.  We seem to have dropped the ball in Afghanistan,

where was certainly necessary to get rid of the Taliban.
<br>
<p>Russell,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having rid the Afghanistan of the Taliban you seem to be taking on the 
<br>
additional burden of supporting them.  Even a little thought will show that 
<br>
your analysis is faulty.  One of the major concerns before destroying the 
<br>
Taliban was that there was going to be major loss of life due to starvation 
<br>
during the winter.  The Taliban had made no provision to feed the population 
<br>
and that was the result. Yet we know there was no major starvation in 
<br>
Afghanistan.  In addition we also remember the many stories about the 
<br>
schools, roads, etc., being rebuilt after the Taliban were gone.  In addition 
<br>
you have not accounted for the ability of the Afghanistani government and 
<br>
people to do for themselves.  They have a pipeline under development that is 
<br>
supposed to generate trillions of dollars of revenue so one might reasonably 
<br>
ask at what point the US is relieved of the necessity to do for the Aghani 
<br>
what they can easily do for themselves.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally the average person on this list does not get a daily report 
<br>
on expenditures inside Afghanistan so it is easy to come in here and feed us 
<br>
a cock &amp; bull story.  We are at war and from long experience we know we face 
<br>
at least two kinds of predators.  There are those on the other side that 
<br>
carry guns and attempt to kill us.  There are those within our own country 
<br>
that try to smooth the way for those with guns.
<br>
