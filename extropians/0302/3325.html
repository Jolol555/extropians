<p>This was in the NY Post a couple days ago.  Im not
<br>
enough of a history wonk to know if it is true or
<br>
just a joke.  Of course Im not enough of a history
<br>
wonk to know if General Washington defeated General
<br>
Grant at Waterloo, but thats my personal shortcoming.
<br>
What we need is a means of expressing history with
<br>
equations, then I would surely take more interest.
<br>
<p>The Complete Military History of France.
<br>
<p>Gallic Wars - Lost. In a war whose ending foreshadows the next 2,000 
<br>
years of French history, France is conquered by, of all things, an Italian.
<br>
<p>Hundred Years War - Mostly lost, saved at last by female schizophrenic 
<br>
who inadvertently creates The First Rule of French Warfare: France's 
<br>
armies are victorious only when not led by a Frenchman.
<br>
<p>Italian Wars - Lost. France becomes the first and only country to ever 
<br>
lose two wars when fighting Italians.
<br>
<p>Wars of Religion - France goes 0-5-4 against the Huguenots.
<br>
<p>Thirty Years War - France is technically not a participant, but manages 
<br>
to get invaded anyway. Claims a tie on the basis that eventually the 
<br>
other participants started ignoring her.
<br>
<p>War of Devolution - Tied. Frenchmen take to wearing red flowerpots as 
<br>
chapeaux.
<br>
<p>The Dutch War - Tied.
<br>
<p>War of the Augsburg League/King William's War/French and Indian War - 
<br>
Lost, but claimed as a tie. Three non-outright defeats in a row cause 
<br>
historians to correctly label the period as the height of French 
<br>
military power.
<br>
<p>War of the Spanish Succession - Lost. The war also gave the French their 
<br>
first taste of a Marlborough, which they have loved every since.
<br>
<p>American Revolution - In a move that will become quite familiar to 
<br>
future Americans, France claims a win even though the English colonists 
<br>
saw far more action. This is later known as &quot;Gaulle Syndrome,&quot; and leads 
<br>
to the Second Rule of French Warfare: France only wins when America does 
<br>
most of the fighting.
<br>
<p>French Revolution - Won, primarily due the fact that the opponent was 
<br>
also French.
<br>
<p>The Napoleonic Wars - Lost. Temporary victories (remember the First 
<br>
Rule!) due to leadership of a Corsican, who ended up being no match for 
<br>
a British footwear designer.
<br>
<p>The Franco-Prussian War - Lost. Germany first plays the role of drunken 
<br>
frat boy to France's ugly girl home alone on a Saturday night.
<br>
<p>World War I - Tied and on the way to losing, France is saved by the 
<br>
United States. Thousands of French women find out what it's like to not 
<br>
only sleep with a winner, but one who doesn't call her &quot;Fraulein.&quot; 
<br>
Sadly, widespread use of condoms by American forces forestalls any 
<br>
improvement in the French bloodline.
<br>
<p>World War II - Lost. Conquered French liberated by the United States and 
<br>
Britain just as they finish learning the lyrics for &quot;Deutschland Cber 
<br>
Alles.&quot;
<br>
<p>War in Indochina - Lost. French forces plead sickness, take to bed with 
<br>
the Dien Bien Flu.
<br>
<p>Algerian Rebellion - Lost. Loss marks the first defeat of a western army 
<br>
by a non-Turkic Muslim force since the Crusades, and produces the First 
<br>
Rule of Muslim Warfare: We can always beat the French. This rule is 
<br>
identical to the First Rules of the Italians, Russians, Germans, 
<br>
English, Dutch, Spanish, Vietnamese and Esquimaux.
<br>
<p>War on Terrorism - Surrenders to Germans and Muslims just to be safe. 
<br>
Attempts to surrender to Vietnamese ambassador fail after he takes 
<br>
refuge in a McDonald's.
