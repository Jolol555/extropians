<p>If I had a nickle for every time someone &quot;reproduces&quot; an experiment in the physical

sciences while *changing* big parts of it, I'd be independently wealthy.
<br>
<p>I think there's a funny kind of elitist/NIH/knowitall circuit at work. At a minumum
<br>
I wish they'd summarize experimental/methodological differences in the precis or
<br>
in a sidebar near the conclusion. Then one could, if warranted, pck that list apart
<br>
for completeness, too.
<br>
&lt;sarcasm&gt;
<br>
It's a big expensive honker; those peons should be flattered that LLNL deigned
<br>
to even dismiss their results.

<p>Excerpting:
<br>
<p>Researchers from around the world are using Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source (APS)
<br>
to see their experiments through new eyes. The nation’s most brilliant X-ray beams
<br>
for materials science research, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of
<br>
Basic Energy Sciences, has opened new doors for scientists in many different fields.
<br>
<p>The 1,104-meter circumference APS, large enough to house a baseball park in its
<br>
center, is a complex of machines and devices that produce, accelerate and store
<br>
a beam of subatomic particles that is the source of APS X-ray beams. Researchers
<br>
have formed groups, called collaborative access teams, to add instruments to enhance
<br>
various types of research at the APS.
<br>
<p>During 1998, the APS increased its brilliance, improved the particle beam’s vertical
<br>
stability, and developed a new method for maintaining a constant level of current in
<br>
the storage ring. These improvements have made the beam 10 times more brilliant than
<br>
its original specifications, and the particle beam’s vertical stability three times
<br>
better than its design goal.
<br>
<p>The new method of accelerator operation, called top-up, will maintain a constant
<br>
level of current in the storage ring. Top-up operation can also maintain constant
<br>
heat load on X-ray optics and storage ring components, maintain constant power
<br>
demands on radio frequency generators, and send a constant signal strength to
<br>
beam-position monitors.
<br>
<p>The second user beam run during 1999 showed the increasing reliability of APS beam
<br>
performance. Beam was available 95.6 percent of scheduled time during the 841-hour
<br>
run, and unscheduled beam loss occurred only once every 42 hours.
<br>
<p>These high-quality, reliable X-ray beams at the APS have brought about new discoveries
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in basic materials structure, encompassing industrial products, medical insights
<br>
and even archaeological information.

<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Measles, mumps are cousins to HIV, Ebola and influenza
<br>
