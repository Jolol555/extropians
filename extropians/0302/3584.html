<em>&gt; So it seems that you're only allowed to use force for

</em><br>
<p>I don't properly understand the relationship between the Security
<br>
Council the General Assembly and the International Court of Justice. 
<br>
<p>I am not sure that the ICoJ sits in the same relation to the Security
<br>
Council and the General Assembly as say the US Supreme Court 
<br>
sits in relation to Congress (the law making body) and the President
<br>
(and military security apparatus). 
<br>
<p>I know the ICoJ (unlike the Supreme Court) does not have full 
<br>
jurisdiction over all matters as some Member Nations have not 
<br>
agreed to accept its jurisdiction in all matters.
<br>
<p>I don't think a Security Council resolution is appealable to the
<br>
ICoJ for instance.
<br>
<p>What does seem to be a clear differentiator though (apart from
<br>
the fact that it is a current issue and not just a post-Cold-War-with
<br>
-only-one-military-superpower-issue) is that the Security Council
<br>
was specifically approached and asked to become &quot;seized of&quot; the
<br>
matters contained in 1441. 
<br>
<p>Having been approached and having become &quot;seized&quot; I don't think
<br>
there is any authority higher than the Security Council under the 
<br>
Charter. Not any Member nation, not the ICoJ and not even the
<br>
General Assembly. On this matter I think the Security Council's
<br>
authority (deriving from the Charter) is supreme. (That I only
<br>
think it and don't know it is a matter of my ignorance and shortage
<br>
of time to find out - someone else may know the facts or be able
<br>
to find them - it certainly seems like it would be a matter of fact 
<br>
whether or not the Security Council's authority on 1441 is 
<br>
superior to all other UN organs like the General Assembly and 
<br>
the ICoJ. I'm pretty sure that it is.) 
<br>
<p>I don't know enough about the UN to sort into hierarchical 
<br>
classes any and all prior breaches of UN resolutions by member
<br>
nations.
<br>
<p>What concerns me (at a minimum) is that the US, a member 
<br>
nation, is openly countenancing a breach of the Security Councils
<br>
authority (and thus the UN's authority) while the Security Council 
<br>
is actually engaged on the same matter. I think this (at least) is 
<br>
unprecedented. I think this (at least) is giving grounds for very
<br>
strong concern.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Most agreements between nations are going to have a lot of 
<br>
detail. Incidental breaches of some of those details will occur
<br>
from time to time and sometimes material or serious breaches 
<br>
will occur. But the Iraq situation covered by 1441 is not a 
<br>
mere detail. If the US, a permanent member of the Security
<br>
Council usurps the authority of the Security Council (for whatever
<br>
reason - and its worth remembering the UN was substantially a
<br>
US initiative in the first place) as blatantly as it seems to be 
<br>
currently considering doing then the Security Council will be
<br>
very publicly invalidated and so too will the UN. If the UN's
<br>
authority to maintain international peace and security is cast
<br>
aside publicly then confidence in international law and that 
<br>
countries will be both willing and able to honour their
<br>
agreements with each other gets cast aside too.
<br>
<p>Next to the paramount issue of security the other issues of 
<br>
&quot;emerging&quot; international law and the matters that are considered
<br>
by the ICoJ are almost window dressing. Further civilized 
<br>
behaviour and agreements are predicated upon meaningful security.
<br>
<p>If the Security Council's authority is cast aside a state of
<br>
international anarchy (perhaps undeclared) would exist. Anarchy
<br>
even between open societies of the west. A veneer of civility and
<br>
order might prevail on the surface for a time, but countries and 
<br>
businesses would be wondering in the absence of a UN whether
<br>
the agreements that they make could be relied upon. This 
<br>
increased uncertainty would run counter to the interests of the
<br>
United States and its citizens too. In the short term the US 
<br>
*might* find that it experienced a net security benefit by acting 
<br>
unilaterally and using its military might without regard for the 
<br>
concerns of  other open societies and their citizens but in the 
<br>
medium and long term the US would be effectively isolating itself
<br>
and then the US, for its own sake, would have to start building a
<br>
&nbsp;new UN version 3. And then it would have to start thinking about
<br>
how such a UN could hold the confidence of non-US citizens and
<br>
governments. It would have to consider how the new UN v3.0 
<br>
would handle security matters. It would not be tenable to expect
<br>
that a majority of the worlds citizens in open countries would
<br>
accept that the US President whom they get no chance to vote
<br>
for (and whom therefore would have little interest in looking out
<br>
for them) would alone get to set security policy (which trickle
<br>
&nbsp;feeds into all other forms of policy) for the whole world on an
<br>
&nbsp;ongoing basis. So a new security council would need to be built.
<br>
&nbsp;Personally I think the US would prefer to keep the security
<br>
&nbsp;council we (humanity) have and work to change it incrementally.
<br>
&nbsp;I don't think it (the US) could expect to put a better (sufficiently
<br>
&nbsp;broad based) Security Council in place more quickly than it
<br>
&nbsp;could reform this one. 
<br>
<p>I still think the best solution is for Bush to engage with Chirac
<br>
and to give Chirac the chance to step up and show his mettle.
<br>
Chirac is the leader of France. France is a permanent member
<br>
of the Security Council and has the responsibility as such to 
<br>
effectively maintain international peace and security (even in the
<br>
face of  new threats to it). Old outdated idealistic and rhetorical
<br>
notions that war &quot;is always, always&quot; the worst solution are not 
<br>
operationalisable, and indeed, when they are seriously held  (if
<br>
they are -as opposed to being held for domestic political
<br>
consumption) by a head of a permanent security council member
<br>
nation with a veto then they disable the *Security* Council from
<br>
being able to maintain *security*. 
<br>
<p>I don't know too much about France but I bet the French police
<br>
are not unable to put their hands on firearms when French 
<br>
criminals are able to posses them. The same principle applies 
<br>
internationally. Either there is a credible duly constituted authority
<br>
that will act to preserve international security or there will not
<br>
be any international security. International security is currently 
<br>
the responsibility of the Security Council. It is currently also 
<br>
Chirac's responsibility. It is therefore his responsibility to step
<br>
up and provide a standard or benchmark for when the Security
<br>
Council should act as the duly constituted body that it is to 
<br>
do its job. Bush should invite him to do just this. Bush should 
<br>
publicly ask Chirac (who may draw on all the formidable intellectual
<br>
resources of France and elsewhere if he so chooses) to come up 
<br>
with a practical benchmark for when the Security Council should go
<br>
to war in general. To produce such a benchmark should not take
<br>
Chirac long. It ought to be doable in days. This war is the last option
<br>
business is childish at the UN level as it amounts to an infinitely high
<br>
standard. At the level of the Security Council a far more balanced 
<br>
weighting should be made on each particular case sure but still against
<br>
some standard or benchmark not against some &quot;only as a last resort&quot;
<br>
and doesn't even articulate the earlier &quot;resorts&quot;.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the standard might be 'on the balance of reasonable risk'.
<br>
The arguments could then take place to allocate the risk to both
<br>
sides of the equation. These would include the risk of forbearing
<br>
from Security Council sanctioned military force for too long. Time
<br>
delaying would be one of the risk factors weighted. I am certain
<br>
the US is feeling a certain amount of time pressure over Iraq 
<br>
because of the situation with North Korea. Time risks of forbearing
<br>
can be factored in the case of Iraq just as can risks of going
<br>
to soon. But no meaningful demonstration of a just use of force
<br>
in a particular instance can be found unless there is at least a 
<br>
benchmark or standard for the Security Council going to war in
<br>
general terms existing.  1441 talks of serious consequences not
<br>
going to war. Serious consequences could mean military action
<br>
and that imo should be a bona fide practical option not one that
<br>
can never be used because of an infinite and self-defeatingly high
<br>
standard.
<br>
<p>Once a standard is in place a whole lot of new positive things 
<br>
become possible. And the actual likelihood of using the force that
<br>
the Security Council would be legitimately able to array would
<br>
be radically reduced because despots would know better than
<br>
to engage the Security Council in glorified games of chicken.
<br>
<p>It is even possible despots could themselves be extracted without
<br>
bloodshed into a UN sin-bin and be able to live out their own
<br>
lives in security and perhaps even with &quot;fame&quot; but without power. 
<br>
<p>There is an opportunity here to take civilization up a notch. I hope 
<br>
Bush and Chirac and others &quot;on&quot; the Security Council are capable
<br>
enough to seize it.
