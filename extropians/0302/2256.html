<em> &gt; Transportation is a necessity and cars the most flexible way of

</em><br>
<p>Both depends on several factors. First, do we really want to travel
<br>
every time or do we have to because there's not better alternative? One
<br>
hour between home and work, twice a day, too much traffic, the time lost
<br>
for better things, that's not freedom, that's stupid :-) Second, the
<br>
more traffic, the less flexible the system becomes and the more we have
<br>
to pay in terms of time and money, i.e. the use/hassle ratio drops.
<br>
<p>Wanted features of private cars: Always available (mostly...). Can reach
<br>
almost every place. Almost independent of external control systems (not
<br>
in large cities). Can be equipped with individual features. Also carry
<br>
our personal environment (feeling of safe surrounding). Many different
<br>
models for different requirements.
<br>
<p>Unwanted features of private cars: Standing unused most of the time,
<br>
requiring space unusable for other things (and expensive in heavily
<br>
populated areas). Expensive in Aquisition, necessary capital bound or
<br>
rates to pay. Looses most of its value rather fast, i.e. burning money.
<br>
Maintenance requires personal time and money. We only have what we have
<br>
bought, regardless of actual requirements (minibus for the kids, sports 
<br>
car for fun, pickup for shopping, small car for town trip). Uncontrolled 
<br>
traffic tends to break down in crowded areas. Driving requires a lot of
<br>
attention, the time is lost for more interesting things. Speed is not
<br>
appropriate for longer trips (&gt;1000km) and very slow in cities.
<br>
<p>I would like to have a transport vehicle when I need one and with the
<br>
features I need at that time. I don't want to care about fuel, parking
<br>
space and maintenance, but send the vehicle away when I don't need it
<br>
any longer. I'd like to drive it when I want to and leave the controls
<br>
to the vehicle when I've better thing to do. And I only want to pay for
<br>
the transportation, not for possessing the vehicle.
