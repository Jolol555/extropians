</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) It will be very difficult to take anything Tim May says 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously in the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty good ideas. The man has gone nuts.
</em><br>
<p>Some of the things he had to say in that piece were interesting, but by the
<br>
end (particularly the Nuke DC bit), well, yes, it seems clear that he's
<br>
insane.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) The lunatic fringe of the anti war movement is far crazier than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lunatic fringe of the pro war movement.
</em><br>
<p>I can't tell if that's true from here... I really can't find any evidence
<br>
for a pro war movement in Australia that includes anyone except the Prime
<br>
Minister and his cabinet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) It's counterintuitive but for some strange reason the war 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporters seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like nicer people that the anti war crowd; that doesn't mean 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What a stupid observation.
