So much vitriol these days. I'm not sure the cortisol levels on either side

permit much self-congratulatory feelgood neurochemistry, a recent post allegedly
<br>
about civility to the contrary...

<p>THE CURTAIN WILL COME DOWN ON THE PEACENIKS
<br>
<p>By Mark Steyn
<br>
The National Post | February 19, 2003
<br>
<p>The &quot;peace&quot; marches? Oh, I've nothing to say. Can't improve on Tony Blair,
<br>
looking out of his window and observing:
<br>
<p>&quot;If there are 500,000 on that march, that is still less than the number of
<br>
people whose deaths Saddam has been responsible for.
<br>
<p>&quot;If there are one million, that is still less than the number of people who
<br>
died in the wars he started.&quot;
<br>
<p>In other words, if it's a numbers game, those are the ones that matter. I'm
<br>
tempted to leave it there and go skiing, but let me come back to it in a
<br>
roundabout sort of way. The other day I got a copy of Andrew Roberts' new
<br>
book, Hitler And Churchill: Secrets Of Leadership, which sounds like some
<br>
lame-o management techniques cash-in, but is, in fact, a very useful take on
<br>
very familiar material. Most of us have read a gazillion books about the
<br>
Second World War (when I say &quot;most of us,&quot; I exclude the fellow in Hyde Park
<br>
on Saturday holding a placard with the words &quot;PEACE IN OUR TIME,&quot; and even
<br>
then I kind of hope he was some waggish saboteur, since the notion that the
<br>
peaceniks, though deluded, are that ignorant is a little mind-boggling).
<br>
But, comparing Britain's and Germany's wartime leaders directly, you can't
<br>
help feeling that victory and defeat were predetermined: As Philip Hensher
<br>
neatly put it in his review of Roberts' essay, &quot;Churchill knew very well
<br>
what Hitler was like, but Hitler had no idea what sort of man Churchill
<br>
was.&quot;
<br>
<p>Just so. When you read Hitler's private assessments of the man who stood
<br>
between him and world domination, they're just silly: Churchill was &quot;that
<br>
puppet of Jewry.&quot; OK, that's fine as a bit of red meat tossed to the crowd
<br>
when you're foaming at Nuremberg, but as a serious evaluation of your
<br>
opponent made in the quiet of your study it's simply ... inadequate. This
<br>
failure to engage with reality is particularly telling when you look at how
<br>
each leader dealt with setbacks: During the Blitz, Churchill would stand on
<br>
the roof and watch the Luftwaffe bombing London; in the morning, he would
<br>
walk through the ruins. Hitler, by contrast, never visited bombed-out areas
<br>
and, just in case the driver should take a wrong turn, he drove the streets
<br>
with his car windows curtained. His final days were spent in a bunker -- the
<br>
perfect ending for a man whose worldview depended on keeping reality at bay
<br>
no matter how relentlessly it closed in on him.
<br>
<p>Hitler's problem was that he was over-invested in ideology. He'd invented a
<br>
universal theory -- the wickedness of the international Jewish conspiracy --
<br>
and he persisted in fitting every square peg of cold hard reality into that
<br>
theory's round hole. Thus, Churchill must be a &quot;puppet of Jewry.&quot; As a
<br>
general rule, when it's reality versus delusion, bet on reality. That held
<br>
true in the Cold War. Moral equivalists like Harold Pinter insisted that
<br>
America and the Soviet Union were both equally bad. But the traffic across
<br>
the Berlin Wall was all one way. East German guards were not unduly
<br>
overworked trying to keep people from getting in. The Eastern bloc collapsed
<br>
because it was a lie, and the alternative wasn't.
<br>
<p>Well, the Soviet Union's gone now so Pinter no longer has to observe the
<br>
pox-on-both-their-houses niceties. Addressing the demonstrators on Saturday,
<br>
he declared that the U.S. is &quot;a country run by a bunch of criminals ... with
<br>
Tony Blair as a hired Christian thug.&quot;
<br>
<p>Got that? It's not Saddam who's the thug, it's Tony. It's not the Baathist
<br>
killers from Tikrit who are the bunch of criminals, it's the Republican
<br>
Party. It's not the million-man murderer of Baghdad who's the new Hitler,
<br>
it's George W. Bush. It's not the Iraqi one-party state with its
<br>
government-controlled media that &quot;crushes dissent,&quot; it's the White House.
<br>
It's not the Wahhabis who are the fundamentalists, it's Bush, Blair and the
<br>
other Christians. It's not Osama bin Laden who's the terrorist, it's
<br>
American foreign policy. Supporting the continued enslavement of the Iraqi
<br>
people is &quot;pacifist,&quot; but it's &quot;racist&quot; for America to disagree with the UN,
<br>
even though it's Colin Powell and Condi Rice doing the disagreeing and the
<br>
fellows they're disagreeing with are a bunch of white guys from Europe.
<br>
<p>The new Universal Theory, to which 99% of Saturday's speakers and placards
<br>
enthusiastically subscribed, is that, whatever the problem, American
<br>
imperialist cowboy aggression is to blame. In fact, it's not so different
<br>
from the old Universal Theory, in that the international Zionist conspiracy
<br>
is assumed to be behind the scenes controlling the cowboys: Bush is a
<br>
&quot;puppet of Jewry,&quot; just like Churchill was -- notwithstanding the fact that
<br>
America's Jews voted overwhelmingly for Gore. But, if you believe that the
<br>
first non-imperialist great power in modern history is the source of all the
<br>
world's woes, then logic is irrelevant. &quot;It's all about oil&quot;? Yes, for the
<br>
French, whose stake in Iraqi oil is far more of a determining factor than
<br>
America's ever has been or will be. &quot;America created Saddam&quot;? No, not
<br>
really, the French and Germans and Russians have sold him far more stuff,
<br>
and Paris built him that reactor which would have made him a nuclear power
<br>
by now, if the Israelis hadn't destroyed it in the Eighties.
<br>
<p>But, as Colin Powell and Jack Straw have surely learned by now, there's no
<br>
real point doing the patient line-by-line rebuttal: Nobody's interested in
<br>
French oil contracts or German arms sales or even Saddamite corpse tallies
<br>
because it doesn't fit into the Universal Theory which insists that
<br>
everything can be explained by the Evil of America. On the other hand, the
<br>
indestructible belief that &quot;over 4,000&quot; civilians were killed by U.S. bombs
<br>
in Afghanistan is impervious to scientific evidence because it accords
<br>
perfectly with the Universal Theory.
<br>
<p>How far are the &quot;peace&quot; crowd prepared to go? Well, they've stopped talking
<br>
about their little pet cause of the Nineties, East Timor, ever since the
<br>
guys who blew up that Bali nightclub and whoever's putting together those
<br>
&quot;Osama&quot; audio tapes started listing support for East Timor's independence as
<br>
one of the Islamist grievances against the West. But why be surprised? In
<br>
fall 2001, being pro-gay and pro-feminist didn't stop the left defending an
<br>
Afghan regime that disenfranchised women and executed homosexuals. Yet these
<br>
are the same fellows who insist that a secular regime like Iraq's would
<br>
never make common cause with Islamic fundamentalists, apparently requiring a
<br>
higher degree of intellectual coherence of Saddam than of themselves.
<br>
<p>You can believe all this if you want, just as Harold Pinter believed that
<br>
the Iron Curtain was only there to prevent fleeing Westerners from swamping
<br>
Warsaw Pact social services. But it depends on keeping reality at arm's
<br>
length or beyond: You're metaphorically driving around with the curtains
<br>
drawn. Perhaps that's why so many of the &quot;peace&quot; crowd get ever so touchy if
<br>
you question their slogans. If you ask a guy with an &quot;It's All About Oil&quot;
<br>
sign what he thinks of the recent contracts signed between Iraq and France's
<br>
Total Fina Elf, he looks blank for a moment and then accuses you of wanting
<br>
to crush dissent. It's not fair, you're trying to pull back his curtain.
<br>
<p>I bet on reality. The defining difference between Hitler and Churchill is
<br>
that, while the former presided over a court of sycophants, the latter
<br>
thrived on argument and antagonism. (Lord Alanbrooke's diaries are
<br>
especially recommended in this regard.) He had a not untypical background
<br>
for an Englishman of his time and class -- an unexceptional public school
<br>
education, a bit of colonial adventuring. It's what the multiculturalists
<br>
would have us believe was a narrow and blinkered upbringing. Yet an English
<br>
public-school debating-society approach to life served him in good stead: He
<br>
was utterly at ease with disagreement, quite happy to have any assertion
<br>
tested. In Saturday's demonstrations, the heirs to Churchill's Harrow
<br>
schoolmasters were well represented -- lots of teachers and professors. Yet
<br>
the difference between now and then is their reluctance to expose their
<br>
assertions to debate -- these days few institutions are as aggressively
<br>
protective of their fragile little pieties as the academy.
<br>
<p>Well, so be it. If everybody thought like Saturday's marchers, it would be
<br>
curtains for all of us. But we're not quite there yet, and reality will be
<br>
breaking in very soon. Saying that Bush is the real &quot;weapon of mass
<br>
destruction&quot; is awful cute the first nine or ten thousand times, but only if
<br>
you live in Toronto or Paris or Madrid. Viewed by an Iraqi from the reality
<br>
of Basra, it's pathetic.
