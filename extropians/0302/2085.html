<a href="mailto:maxmcorp@worldonline.dk?Subject=Re:%20Time.com%20asks%20you%20to%20vote%20for%20most%20dangerous%20country">maxmcorp@worldonline.dk</a> writes: I must say that I cannot really see much 
<br>
point of being on the list anymore either. It has allways had political 
<br>
undertones, but now it's so bad that it ought to be renamed to 
<br>
washington@extropy.org.
<br>
<p>Max,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how big an archive you have or if you can go back and 
<br>
reread what has been said for the past two or three months.  But, my 
<br>
impression is that you (plural) are not complaining about there being 
<br>
political expression on the Extropy list, you are complaining that when you 
<br>
express yourself politically there are those that refute your position.  I 
<br>
don't know if you agree or not but that is my definite impression of what the 
<br>
European contingent is saying.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what is or is not Extropian, I don't know how you separate the 
<br>
technical or scientific aspects from the cultural or political effects.  In 
<br>
my mind both will be proceeding simultaneously.  Not only that, but the 
<br>
future will proceed from the present as others have pointed out.  At the 
<br>
extreme there are forces loose in our world society that would not only kill 
<br>
scientific progress but also roll back many of the gains that we have made.  
<br>
I clearly remember as a boy during the beginning of WW2 how the adults 
<br>
characterized the effect Hitler was having in Europe, &quot;The lights are going 
<br>
out all over Europe.&quot;  We were proceeding backwards into savagery.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under those circumstances we would have no chance at all for 
<br>
scientific progress -- AI, Nanotechnology, Immortality, Art all gone and 
<br>
forgotten.
<br>
Ron h.
