<p>
Interesting the stuff that the editors of the leading science journals
<br>
deem worthy of discussion sometimes.
<br>
<p>I caught this one in the Jan 31 edition of Science.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/299/5607/625">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/299/5607/625</a>
<br>
<p>An Epidemic of Politics
<br>
Donald Kennedy
<br>
<p>&quot;Americans have come to accept the role of politics in the 
<br>
appointment of certain kinds of public officials. Few of us
<br>
are surprised, though some may be disappointed, when a 
<br>
federal judgeship is awarded because the candidate passes
<br>
a litmus test of loyalty to some principle important to the
<br>
president's party. Scientific appointments, however, should
<br>
rest on more objective criteria of training, ability, and 
<br>
performance--at least, that's what this community has always
<br>
believed. Thus we can view with relative calm the interrogation
<br>
of a future secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
<br>
about his views on abortion. But it seems out of place when 
<br>
appointees to scientific advisory committees are subjected
<br>
to tests of political loyalty. And study section membership,
<br>
which involves peer review of scientific proposals, surely
<br>
ought to be free of such barriers to entry.
<br>
<p>During the past fall, Science published several news stories
<br>
related to this practice. One involved the wholesale
<br>
replacement of members of the advisory committee to the 
<br>
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's)
<br>
National Center for Environmental Health, without 
<br>
consultation with the center's director. Another involved 
<br>
CDC's Advisory Committee on Lead Poisoning and 
<br>
Prevention. Still another covered the National Human
<br>
Research Protections Advisory Committee and the Advisory
<br>
Committee on Genetic Testing. Perhaps most telling was
<br>
the revamping of the membership of the study section that
<br>
evaluates grants for the study of workplace injuries for the
<br>
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. 
<br>
Advisory committees might have been vulnerable to 
<br>
occasional stacking of this kind in the past, though it is
<br>
&nbsp;a bad idea. But study sections?
<br>
<p>The present epidemic, in which advisory committees are
<br>
shut down and reassembled with new members, and 
<br>
candidates are subjected to loyalty tests, seems old hat 
<br>
to some observers. &quot;After all, that's fairly standard practice,&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;we have been told by officials in HHS. Well, it isn't--or
<br>
&nbsp;at least it wasn't. What's unusual about the current 
<br>
epidemic is not that the Bush administration examines
<br>
candidates for compatibility with its &quot;values.&quot; It's how 
<br>
deep the practice cuts; in particular, the way it now 
<br>
invades areas once immune to this kind of manipulation.
<br>
<p>In this space in the 25 October 2002 issue, Science 
<br>
published an editorial by David Michaels and a group
<br>
of colleagues. Several were distinguished former public
<br>
servants who had been involved with some of the
<br>
committees in question, and they brought a useful 
<br>
personal-experience perspective to the matter. Their piece
<br>
was a story in itself, but what followed was even more
<br>
interesting. It loosed a volley of letters to us in which 
<br>
scientists told of similar experiences. Here are two examples:
<br>
<p>A nominee for the National Institutes of Health Muscular
<br>
Dystrophy Research Coordinating Committee is vetted
<br>
by a staffer from the Office of White House Liaison, 
<br>
Health and Human Services. After being asked about her
<br>
views on various Bush administration policies, none of them
<br>
related to the work of the committee, she is asked whether
<br>
she supports the president's embryonic stem cell policy.
<br>
<p>A distinguished professor of psychiatry and psychology
<br>
receives a call from the White House about his nomination
<br>
to serve on the National Council on Drug Abuse. His 
<br>
interviewer declares that he must vet him to &quot;determine
<br>
whether he held any views that might be embarrassing to
<br>
the president.&quot; A series of questions follows, into which
<br>
the interviewer interpolates a running score, viz.: &quot;You're
<br>
two for three; the president opposes needle exchange on
<br>
moral grounds regardless of the outcome.&quot; He then asks
<br>
whether the candidate had voted for Bush, and on being
<br>
informed that he had not, asked: &quot;Why didn't you support
<br>
the president?&quot;
<br>
<p>This stuff would be prime material for a Robin Williams 
<br>
comedy shtick, but it really isn't funny. The purpose of 
<br>
advisory committees is to provide balanced, thoughtful 
<br>
advice to the policy process; it is better not to put the
<br>
policy up front. As for study sections, deciding which
<br>
research projects to support has always been a matter 
<br>
for objective peer review. Political preferences are for
<br>
the pork barrel, and the Congress is already doing too
<br>
much of that. Indeed, the applicable statute for all this--
<br>
the Federal Advisory Committee Act--specifically requires
<br>
that committees be balanced and &quot;not inappropriately 
<br>
influenced by the appointing authority.&quot; It would be a
<br>
good idea for HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson and the
<br>
White House Personnel Office to read the law, and then
<br>
follow it.&quot;
