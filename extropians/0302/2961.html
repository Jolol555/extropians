<p><em>&gt; What's good about defending a country?  I certainly don't give a damn

<em>&gt; about the US or any other country, and I have little patience for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patriots of any stripe.  How about standing up for /principles/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of countries like a rational forward-looking person should?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The old concept of &quot;country&quot; is one whose time is passed.  Let's move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the future and support the rights of sovereign sentient beings.
</em><br>
<p>The future won't be here for a while, and you surely understand
<br>
the evolutionary forces behind patriotism.  Don't you agree that
<br>
countries whose citizens are endowed with patriotism survived
<br>
throughout history whereas countries not so endowed perished?
<br>
<p>Yet you are not annoyed by the irrational love of a mother
<br>
for her child.  Why are you annoyed, then, by the irrational
<br>
love of someone for his or her nation?
<br>
<p>Now if you and I lived in a post-apocalyptic future and our
<br>
little commune's survival was at stake, I'll bet that your
<br>
instincts would rise to the occasion.  In some extensions, you
<br>
might even be willing to sacrifice yourself for the community.
<br>
Or would you head for the hills as soon as you had a chance?
<br>
<p>At times, I feel like a defector (in the game-theoretic sense)
<br>
when I don't feel much patriotism.  I'm here and alive because
<br>
my ancestors and their neighbors in America and Europe felt
<br>
some community spirit, and would defend their tribe based
<br>
partly on their feelings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that one must grant nations /practical/ import, the same way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one must recognize the physical power of the government you live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under to jail you or worse.
</em><br>
<p>And of course, your self-interest is clear here.  I don't blame you
<br>
for your self-interest in the slightest, but simply am reminding 
<br>
you that most people feel more than that at times, and you probably
<br>
do too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the post to which I was replying seemed to imply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that nations had some /moral/ import; he seemed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that the protesters were &quot;anti-American&quot;, as if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there were something wrong with that.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if I moved to China, there *would* be something 
<br>
wrong with me being &quot;anti-China&quot;.  At the very least,
<br>
it would be immense ingratitude to my neighbors.  As
<br>
for souls in other countries being &quot;anti-U.S.&quot;, most
<br>
of them deny it.  As for those who don't deny it, I
<br>
praise their candor, but have to also consider them
<br>
enemies of the folks currently giving me sustenance
<br>
and protection.  That makes them my enemies.
