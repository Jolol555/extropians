<p><p><em>&gt; Gentlemen;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not know if this is relevant to your discussion, and please forgive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me for butting in, but...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...'Geddy' has been taking Selegiline (R-(-)-Deprenyl hydrochloride)  @
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20mg daily  since 21st December 2002. Geddy is a 44-year-old male human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in average health who does not suffer from any neurological disorder,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and is basically taking selegiline to see what happens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are monitoring him. He intends to stay on the drug indefinitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless there are deleterious effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For obvious reasons Geddy wishes to remain low-profile! We're happy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discuss this trial and any clinical results if contacted WITH PGP at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  <a href="mailto:alex@ramonsky.com?Subject=Re:%20Performance%20enhancement%20with%20selegiline">alex@ramonsky.com</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is however happy for the world to know the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He has noticed several changes since beginning the trial. The first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change was an increase in confidence, he felt calmer and less shy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was able to communicate more easily. He felt more confident and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertive in business environments. Then he noticed that an annoying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nervous habit of wiggling his toes had stopped. He feels he can control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his emotions more sensibly and think more rationally under stress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His dreams have become more vivid, and he feels his fantasy life and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagination have improved. He explains an odd sensation of 'thinking too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast to be able to verbalise it', which is the only downer so far. On
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole he seems a great deal happier as an individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We may have to wait some time to see if he lives longer, of course. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other data are coming in, all along the way. As far as I know, this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first trial of a healthy human?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AR
</em><br>
<p>### If he's happy with it, more power to him. It is not proven that
<br>
selegiline will make you live longer, but then it won't cut your life short,
<br>
either. As long as it makes the user lead a happy, useful life, it's good.
<br>
