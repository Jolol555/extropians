Editorial in English Paper on 9/11
<br>
<p>No matter what your views on President Bush's statement of upcoming war,
<br>
this, from an English journalist, is very interesting.  For those of you not
<br>
familiar with the UK's Daily Mirror, this is a notoriously left-wing daily
<br>
that is normally not supportive of the Colonials across the Atlantic.
<br>
<p>Tony Parsons Daily Mirror September 11, 2002
<br>
<p>ONE year ago, the world witnessed a unique kind of broadcasting -- The mass
<br>
murder of thousands, live on television.  As a lesson in the Pitiless
<br>
cruelty of the human race, September 11 was up there, with Pol Pot's
<br>
mountain of skulls in Cambodia, or the skeletal bodies stacked like garbage
<br>
in the Nazi concentration camps.  An unspeakable act so cruel, so calculated
<br>
and so utterly merciless that surely the world could agree on one thing -
<br>
nobody deserves this fate.  Surely there could be consensus: the victims
<br>
were truly innocent, the perpetrators truly evil.
<br>
<p>But to the world's eternal shame, 9/11 is increasingly seen as America's
<br>
comeuppance.  Incredibly, anti-Americanism has increased over the last year.
<br>
There has always been a simmering resentment to the USA in this country -
<br>
too loud, too rich, too full of themselves and so much happier than
<br>
Europeans - but it has become an epidemic.  And it seems incredible to me.
<br>
More than that, it turns my stomach.
<br>
<p>America is this country's greatest friend and our staunchest ally. We're bon
<br>
ded to the US by culture, language and blood.  A little over half a century
<br>
ago, around half a million Americans died for our freedoms, as well as their
<br>
own.  Have we forgotten so soon?  And exactly a year ago, thousands of
<br>
ordinary men, women and children - not just Americans, but from dozens of
<br>
countries - were butchered by a small group of religious fanatics.
<br>
<p>Are we so quick to betray them? What touched the heart about those who died
<br>
in the twin towers and on the planes was that we recognized them.  Young
<br>
fathers and mothers, somebody's son and somebody's daughter, husbands and
<br>
wives, and children, some unborn.
<br>
<p>And these people brought it on themselves?  And their nation is to blame for
<br>
their meticulously planned slaughter? These days you don't have to be some
<br>
dust-encrusted nut job in Kabul or Karachi or Finsbury Park to see America
<br>
as the Great Satan.  The anti-American alliance is made up of self-loathing
<br>
liberals who blame the Americans for every ill in the Third World, and
<br>
conservatives suffering from power-envy, bitter that the world's only
<br>
superpower can do what it likes without having to ask permission.
<br>
<p>The truth is that America has behaved with enormous restraint since
<br>
September 11.  Remember, remember.
<br>
<p>Remember the gut-wrenching tapes of weeping men phoning their wives to say,
<br>
&quot;I love you,&quot; before they were burned alive.
<br>
<p>Remember those people leaping to their deaths from the top of burning
<br>
skyscrapers.
<br>
<p>Remember the hundreds of firemen buried alive.
<br>
<p>Remember the smiling face of that beautiful little girl who was on one of
<br>
the planes with her mum.
<br>
<p>Remember, remember - and realize that America has never retaliated for 9/11
<br>
in anything like the way it could have.
<br>
<p>So a few al-Qaeda tourists got locked without a trial n Camp X-ray? Pass the
<br>
Kleenex...
<br>
<p>So some Afghan wedding receptions were shot up after they merrily fired
<br>
their semi-automatics in a sky full of American planes?  A shame, but maybe
<br>
next time they should stick to confetti.
<br>
<p>AMERICA could have turned a large chunk of the world into a parking lot.
<br>
That it didn't is a sign of strength. American voices are already being
<br>
raised against attacking Iraq - that's what a democracy is for.  How many in
<br>
the Islamic world will have a minute's silence for the slaughtered innocents
<br>
of 9/11?  How many Islamic leaders will have the guts to say that the mass
<br>
murder of 9/11 was an abomination?
<br>
<p>When the news of 9/11 broke on the West Bank, those freedom-loving
<br>
Palestinians were dancing in the street.  America watched all of that - and
<br>
didn't push the button.  We should thank the stars that America is the most
<br>
powerful nation in the world.  I still find it incredible that 9/11 did not
<br>
provoke all-out war.  Not a &quot;war on terrorism.&quot;  A real war.
<br>
<p>The fundamentalist dudes are talking about &quot;opening the gates of hell,&quot; if
<br>
America attacks Iraq.  Well, America could have opened the gates of hell
<br>
like you wouldn't believe.
<br>
<p>The US is the most militarily powerful nation that ever strode the face of
<br>
the earth.  The campaign in Afghanistan may have been less than perfect and
<br>
the planned war on Iraq may be misconceived.
<br>
<p>But don't blame America for not bringing peace and light to these wretched
<br>
countries.  How many democracies are there in the Middle East, or in the
<br>
Muslim world?  You can count them on the fingers of one hand -assuming you
<br>
haven't had any chopped off for minor shoplifting.
<br>
<p>I love America, yet America is hated.  I guess that makes me Bush's poodle.
<br>
But I would rather be a dog in New York City than a Prince in Riyadh. Above
<br>
all, America is hated because it is what every country wants to be - rich,
<br>
free, strong, open, optimistic.  Not ground down by the past, or religion,
<br>
or some caste system.  America is the best friend this country ever had and
<br>
we should start remembering that.
<br>
<p>Or do you really think the USA is the root of all evil?  Tell it to  the
<br>
loved ones of the men and women who leaped to their death from the burning
<br>
towers.  Tell it to the nursing mothers whose husbands died on one of the
<br>
hijacked planes, or were ripped apart in a collapsing skyscraper. And tell
<br>
it to the hundreds of young widows whose husbands worked for the New York
<br>
Fire Department.
<br>
<p>To our shame, George Bush gets a worse press than Saddam Hussein. Once we
<br>
were told that Saddam gassed the Kurds, tortured his own people and set up
<br>
rape-camps in Kuwait.  Now we are told he likes Quality Street.  Save me the
<br>
orange center, oh mighty one!  Remember, remember, September 11.  One of the
<br>
greatest atrocities in human history was committed against America.
<br>
<p>No, do more than remember. Never forget.
