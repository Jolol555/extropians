<p>You give Bill too much credit. He is only defending his installed base using every
<br>
rhetorical means at his disposal. He'd appeal to Santa Claus if he thought it would
<br>
help calm the market more.
<br>
<p>He is claiming, grandiosely, that nature doesn't make mistakes when compared with
<br>
careful initial design. That, at least, is my facial interpretation of his wording.
<br>
He is, as crude people sometimes say, /jerking us off/.
<br>
<p>Of *course* one likes to fix only what's broken. I believe that successive refinement is often a good thing.
<br>
It is also, sometimes, only disguising a mudball. So...
<br>
<p>A fundamentally flawed interprocess communications model can be refactored *how*?
<br>
Truly secure capabilities a la KeyKOS can be added to the existing OS--*how*?
<br>
Brittle software systems can be made as reliable as a Rolls-Royce--*how*?
<br>
<p>I've been in the software business 30 years (no brag, just fact), and I think
<br>
I can at least sometimes tell the difference.
<br>
<p>If Microsoft can't factor out a web browser from its OS, as it claimed in its
<br>
recent court cases, what does that indicate?
<br>
<p>Or were they lying through their teeth? If so, what does *that* indicate?
