ABSTRACT

<br>
<p>There is an increasing number of data by in vitro and in vivo experiments,
<br>
indicating that (-)-deprenyl is neuroprotective to dopamine neurons, even
<br>
though detailed mechanism remains to be clarified. In this paper
<br>
neuroprotection by (-)-deprenyl and structurally related compounds was
<br>
examined in concern with the suppression of apoptosis induced by a reactive
<br>
oxygen species, peroxynitrite generated from SIN-1. The apoptotic DNA
<br>
damage was quantitatively determined using dopaminergic SH-SYSY cells and by
<br>
a single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. DNA damage induced by
<br>
peroxynitrite was proved to be apoptotic by prevention of the damage by
<br>
cycloheximide or actinomycin-D. (-)-Deprenyl and other propargylamines
<br>
protected the cells from apoptosis in a dose-dependent way. (-)-Deprenyl
<br>
protected the cells even after it was washed out, suggesting that it may
<br>
initiate the intracellular process to repress the apoptotic death program.
<br>
The study on the structure-activity relationship of (-)-deprenyl analogues
<br>
revealed that a N-propargyl residue with adequate size of hydrophobic
<br>
structure is essentially required for the anti-apoptotic activity. These
<br>
results suggest that (-)-deprenyl and related compounds may protect neurons
<br>
from apoptosis and be applicable to delay the deterioration of neurons
<br>
during advancing ageing and in neurodegenerative disorders.

<p>I'm reposting this abstract above, Rafal, because you failed to address it,
<br>
much less refute it, in your reply to the last message to you.

<br>
<p>I think I have already posted several that make that claim, and I don't know
<br>
&nbsp;why I should even bother to report more of them. I have quoted at least
<br>
half a dozen abstracts here, Rafal, and you have failed to address the data
<br>
and claims in those abstracts in any detail whatsoever! Instead you just
<br>
keep restating the same old argument (that selegiline is only helps with
<br>
symptoms rather than with neuroprotection, as if I didn't hear it the first
<br>
time), and you base that argument on the *single* study that *you*
<br>
personally prefer to recognize as the *only* valid study, as if I and
<br>
everyone here should consider you to be the world's leading authority on the
<br>
subject.
<br>
<p>You've given us no reason to believe that you have assessed the evidence
<br>
better than other experts who specialize in this field and who still
<br>
currently believe that the preponderance of the evidence supports the view
<br>
that selegiline is neuroprotective in PD. Maybe they are right or maybe they
<br>
are wrong, but you Rafal certainly don't have a monopoly on such knowledge.
<br>
I will however for the moment concede that the evidence for neuroprotection
<br>
in PD is not unequivocal, and in fact I sincerely do agree that isn't, just
<br>
so that we can get past this point. Okay? Nevermind PD for now.
<br>
<p>Here above is again is the abstract I posted in my last message, which you
<br>
ignored like most others I have posted. Please respond to it in
<br>
detail.Specifically, please explain why this research does not support my
<br>
contention that selegiline is neuroprotective *in general* -- setting aside
<br>
for the moment any specific contradictions that might be present in the PD
<br>
literature. (Perhaps PD is not a good model for general life-extension
<br>
purposes. After all neither you nor I have clinical PD (I hope) -- and as
<br>
stated in the header this discussion is really about performance enhancement
<br>
with selegiline for normal transhumanist folks like you and me.)
<br>
<p>I'd like to think you are not so closed-minded, Rafal. You have often
<br>
criticized me for such, yet on this matter you are speaking from the same
<br>
conservative perspective as do those who criticize the entire subject of
<br>
anti-aging medicine -- your hard-line skepticism about this subject is
<br>
hardly in the spirit of transhumanism or extropianism.
<br>
<p>Note that the abstract is dated 1999, far more recent than the study that
<br>
you've stated is &quot;the last word.&quot;
<br>
<p>Tell us why we should not accept this research as valid.
