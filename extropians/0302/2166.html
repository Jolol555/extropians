A Failed Mission
<br>
By PAUL KRUGMAN
<br>
<p>Some commentators have suggested that the Columbia disaster is more than a
<br>
setback - that it marks the end of the whole space shuttle program. Let's
<br>
hope they're right.
<br>
<p>I say this with regret. Like millions of other Americans, I dream of a day
<br>
when humanity expands beyond Earth, and I'm still a sucker for well-told
<br>
space travel stories - I was furious when Fox canceled &quot;Firefly.&quot; I also
<br>
understand that many people feel we shouldn't retreat in the face of
<br>
adversity. But the shuttle program didn't suddenly go wrong last weekend;
<br>
in terms of its original mission, it was a failure from the get-go.
<br>
Indeed, manned space flight in general has turned out to be a bust.
<br>
<p>The key word here is &quot;manned.&quot; Space flight has been a huge boon to
<br>
mankind. It has advanced the cause of science: for example, cosmology, and
<br>
with it our understanding of basic physics, has made huge strides through
<br>
space-based observation. Space flight has also done a lot to improve life
<br>
here on Earth, as space-based systems help us track storms, communicate
<br>
with one another, even find out where we are. This column traveled 45,000
<br>
miles on its way to The New York Times: I access the Internet via
<br>
satellite.
<br>
<p>Yet almost all the payoff from space travel, scientific and practical, has
<br>
come from unmanned vehicles and satellites. Yes, astronauts fitted the
<br>
Hubble telescope with new eyeglasses; but that aside, we have basically
<br>
sent people into space to show that we can. In the 1960's, manned space
<br>
travel was an extension of the cold war. After the Soviet Union dropped
<br>
out of the space race, we stopped visiting the moon. But why do we still
<br>
send people into orbit?
<br>
<p>In space, you see, people are a nuisance. They're heavy; they need to
<br>
breathe; trickiest of all, as we have so tragically learned, they need to
<br>
get back to Earth.
<br>
<p>One result is that manned space travel is extremely expensive. The space
<br>
shuttle was supposed to bring those costs down, by making the vehicles
<br>
reusable - hence the deliberately unglamorous name, suggesting a
<br>
utilitarian bus that takes astronauts back and forth. But the shuttle
<br>
never delivered significant cost savings - nor could it really have been
<br>
expected to. Manned space travel will remain prohibitively expensive until
<br>
there is a breakthrough in propulsion - until chemical rockets are
<br>
replaced with something better.
<br>
<p>And even then, will there be any reason to send people, rather than our
<br>
ever more sophisticated machines, into space?
<br>
<p>I had an epiphany a few months ago while reading George Dyson's &quot;Project
<br>
Orion,&quot; which tells the true story of America's efforts to build a
<br>
nuclear-powered spacecraft. The project was eventually canceled, in part
<br>
because the proposed propulsion system - a series of small nuclear
<br>
explosions - would have run afoul of the test-ban treaty. But if the
<br>
project had proceeded, manned spacecraft might have visited much of the
<br>
solar system by now.
<br>
<p>Faced with the thought that manned space travel - the real thing, not the
<br>
show NASA puts on to keep the public entertained - could already have
<br>
happened if history had played out a bit differently, I was forced to
<br>
confront my youthful dreams of space flight with the question, So what? I
<br>
found myself trying to think of wonderful things people might have done in
<br>
space these past 30 years - and came up blank. Scientific observation?
<br>
Machines can do that. Mining the asteroids? A dubious idea - but even if
<br>
it makes sense, machines can do that too. (A parallel: Remember all those
<br>
predictions of undersea cities? Sure enough, we now extract lots of
<br>
valuable resources from the ocean floor - but nobody wants to live there,
<br>
or even visit in person.)
<br>
<p>The sad truth is that for many years NASA has struggled to invent reasons
<br>
to put people into space - sort of the way the Bush administration
<br>
struggles to invent reasons to . . . but let's not get into that today.
<br>
It's an open secret that the only real purpose of the International Space
<br>
Station is to give us a reason to keep flying space shuttles.
<br>
<p>Does that mean people should never again go into space? Of course not.
<br>
Technology marches on: someday we will have a cost-effective way to get
<br>
people into orbit and back again. At that point it will be worth
<br>
rethinking the uses of space. I'm not giving up on the dream of space
<br>
colonization. But our current approach - using hugely expensive rockets to
<br>
launch a handful of people into space, where they have nothing much to do
<br>
- is a dead end.
