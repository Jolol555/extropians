<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;the Extropians list do so much better than this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't think it is either wise or even particularly clear to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ban discussion on anything that people think you *might* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think to be about the &quot;Iraq topic&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that you are proposing banning the topic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likely to be of *greatest* interest and *most* extropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consequence over exactly that period when it will be of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *most* relevance and of most natural concern to many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the list..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let us be very very clear here. You are not proposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; engaging further yourself to lift the level of debate, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are not proposing to just read around a topic that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have posted on yourself in the past, you are not making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some point about more efficient ways to communicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you are *actually* proposing closing down for three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  months what other people want to say *before*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the particular circumstances and ramifications they wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to discuss have even arisen. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is correct.  Why?  Because I see this discussion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying friendships, which might otherwise have proved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective in the pursuit of effective causes, and for nothing.
</em><br>
<p>If the friendships are not yet destroyed you are assuming
<br>
they will be. Perhaps they may emerge stronger.
<br>
<p>You are assuming not just a net loss but a total loss - &quot;for
<br>
nothing&quot;.
<br>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why people might be motivated 
<br>
to support a ban on discussion on a particular topic and almost
<br>
all of these concerns might be accomodated by innovation
<br>
rather than censorship.
<br>
<p>For instance if the topic of Iraq was sufficiently clearly 
<br>
qualified (I don't know how many of the current threads you
<br>
actually want to ban) I would be more than happy to 
<br>
accommodate other peoples desires not to hear about it by
<br>
prefixing the subject header as has been discussed by other
<br>
posters. But for this to be operationalizable the topic scope
<br>
needs to be pretty clear. Having such a process in place 
<br>
would not just give us a single solution for now but would
<br>
offer a generically applicable solution for future use - and 
<br>
without censorship.
<br>
<p>I have posted on the merits of over-engineering for
<br>
courtesy and efficiency before - it is not impossible to 
<br>
discuss a topic courteously and it is a choice that each 
<br>
of us can make. We can acknowledge systemic biases in
<br>
the structure of the list and it is certainly not impossible to 
<br>
set up processes that encourage more judicial choice
<br>
in how people choose to pursue discussions on the list. 
<br>
This has been discussed before. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Nonetheless it does seem to remain true that if you want
<br>
to get involved in the protection of people friendships from
<br>
those people themselves then you really may have to go for
<br>
censorship. *If* you want to. I can't see such an action as 
<br>
extropic but I can see it quite easily as the opposite.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To yield to the temptation to practice this sort of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; censorship looks to me like kicking an extropic own-goal. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I vote against. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But if you really want to go down the route of censorship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and I *do* note the support for it (and thankfully *some*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opposition) then at least do it properly. Set a time for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tallying the votes and I will abide by the will of the majority.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I recall correctly the list is a benevolent dictatorship of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ExI, though member-influenced, of course.
</em><br>
<p>For my part I'd comply with *either* a request from ExI *or*  
<br>
a majority of posted preferences up to a set time you choose
<br>
because you called for the ban.  
<br>
<p>I think it would be good to clarify this and more towards 
<br>
solutions rather than have to re-visit these procedural issues
<br>
over and over. Imo censorship is quite rightly *never* going
<br>
to sit well with extropians but innovative solutions and steps
<br>
taken to improve the quality of the discourse that don't require
<br>
censorship - surely we can do these. There is an opportunity
<br>
here if we choose to see it that way. Censorship can always
<br>
be the fallback position
