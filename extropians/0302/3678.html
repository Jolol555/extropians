<p>Again, that's because of NASA, not because of space
<br>
itself.  As I have posted on this list before, there
<br>
are several ventures operating right now that believe,
<br>
with significant justification, that they can create
<br>
their own manned &quot;space programs&quot; (space tourism and
<br>
other commercial ventures) for far less than one
<br>
billion dollars (investment before the operation
<br>
becomes self-financing, even profitable).
<br>
<p>As others have pointed out, there's also the flaw of
<br>
attacking this as &quot;either/or&quot;.  One of the main rules
<br>
of political budgets: if you successfully attack one
<br>
organization's budget, that frees up the money for
<br>
*ANY* other use, not just the one you were trying to
<br>
divert its resources towards.  If you shut down NASA,
<br>
who is to say the money won't go to, say, welfare or
<br>
the latest War On X instead of to undersea R&amp;D?  Lobby
<br>
for something on its own merits; don't lobby by
<br>
comparing it to a specific other.
<br>
<p>Though, that said, attacking the largest budgetary
<br>
consumptions, for instance the parts of the defense
<br>
budget even the DOD never asked for, could free up a
<br>
lot of money for other uses.  One could lobby for
<br>
oceanic R&amp;D as boosting the economies of (read: pork
<br>
to) every coastal state, which accounts for over 1/3,
<br>
maybe over 1/2 depending on how much coast you need
<br>
(especially if you include development of the Great
<br>
Lakes), of the United States.  Which is how these
<br>
unwanted DOD expenditures get approval in the first
<br>
place.
<br>
<p>So...anyone want to contact this author and get him to
<br>
form a suitably pork-barrel version of what he wants
<br>
and propose it to Congress?  If he proposes it that
<br>
way, he might find unexpectedly easy passage.
