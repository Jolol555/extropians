<em>&gt; Let me know thanks, Nate
</em><br>
<p>About 20 years ago I took a speed-reading course similar to the old
<br>
&quot;Evelyn Wood&quot; speed reading course. As I recall I was able to roughly
<br>
triple my reading speed to something like 1500-1800 words/minute. (They
<br>
say 3000+ words/min is possible, but I never reached that level.) I was
<br>
impressed with my increase in reading speed, but since then it has
<br>
dropped back to probably about 600-700 words/minute. I think my reading
<br>
speed dropped back because I actually enjoy the English language; speed
<br>
reading definitely hindered my ability to appreciate well written words,
<br>
even if I was able to comprehend the author's meanings.
<br>
<p>The trick to speed reading is learning how not to &quot;sound out&quot; the words
<br>
in one's mind as one reads. But as above it pleases me to sound out the
<br>
words in my mind as I read, and so I lost interest in speed reading.
