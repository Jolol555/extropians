</em><br>
<p>This sounds a little piqued Hubert, I mean no criticism by this as I
<br>
think that's natural enough given the topic and the strong feelings
<br>
many people have of it. But I am interested in your suggestion that
<br>
there might be an evolutionary and neurological bias towards 
<br>
feeling good about supporting a decision to engage in conflict. 
<br>
<p>I am sceptical myself that this is likely to be a significant bias but
<br>
what you saying is not obviously impossible (at least to me) do
<br>
you have an data or research to support your view?
<br>
<p>For my part I wonder sometimes if my atheism which I think is 
<br>
a position I've arrived at intellectually rather than emotionally
<br>
may bias my perceptions more towards being willing to be
<br>
hawkish when the circumstances require it. 
<br>
<p>I grew up in a Christian tradition (Roman Catholic secondary
<br>
school and all) and went through the stages of agnostic to atheist
<br>
in my mid to late teens. I think I can still recall and adopt a 
<br>
religious viewpoint quite easily but I don't know to what extent
<br>
my transition from theist to atheist is a unique one. I say this to 
<br>
identify a possible bias of my own so that I can now say this in 
<br>
the manner of a open question.
<br>
<p>I often wonder if belief in a &quot;higher being&quot; in some ways gets
<br>
believers off the hook a bit in having to face what seems to be
<br>
a fundamental but unpleasant truth. It certainly seems crystal clear
<br>
to me that sometimes we (individual people and groups of people)
<br>
simply do have to fight or die when we are confronted by others
<br>
who have decided to exercise their choice to regard us as prey.
<br>
Yet there are apparently a small but not insignificant percentage
<br>
of the population that say that they would oppose war in all 
<br>
circumstances. This I don't get. I can make sense of it if I consider
<br>
that theists are regarding this life as a precursor to another one
<br>
- that quite naturally would change the risk/return calculation a bit, 
<br>
but in the absence of the view that there is another life or that the
<br>
supernatural cavalry are going to come to our rescue in this life
<br>
(or the next) I really don't get how people could not see that the
<br>
loss of their own life and perhaps that of their families, friends, 
<br>
children who may depend on them is a more acceptable loss that
<br>
to fight back in self defence and if necessary kill the predator that
<br>
will otherwise kill them and likely others as well.
<br>
<p>Could there be a link between theism and pacifism and atheism
<br>
and the willingness to take arms against the sea of troubles?
<br>
Clearly some theists believe in just wars but are there atheist
<br>
pacifists that are willing to be killed by predators rather than 
<br>
fight back in self defence?
<br>

<br>
<p>(Aside: It would be great if we could have a non-vitriolic 
<br>
discussion on this folks as I really do want to understand )
