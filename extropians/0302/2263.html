<p>That is a problem with tiny cars. The driver in a large car has a six
<br>
foot crumple zone of metal in front of them when they drive into a tree.
<br>
In a micro car there is just you and the tree.
<br>
(Gives a new slant to the term 'tree-hugger' :-)).
<br>
That is part of what I was getting at when I said that micro cars lead
<br>
to a different style of driving. 'Aggressive' drivers won't last long in
<br>
a micro. A senior policeman (half jokingly) once said that the best road
<br>
safety measure for cars would be a large spike (sorry!) in the centre of
<br>
the steering wheel pointing straight at the driver's chest.
<br>
Driving a micro car is a bit like that.
<br>
<p>Spike's remark led me to some research. And he's right! A few years ago
<br>
there was a choice of several small cars in USA, then they all
<br>
disappeared. i.e. the Geo (Chevrolet) Metro, Suzuki Swift and Ford
<br>
Aspire. The new European and Japanese micro cars are more fuel-efficient
<br>
than even these cars, but it sounds like there is little chance of them
<br>
appearing in USA in the near future.
<br>
<p>I just ran a search at whatcar.com - a UK motoring magazine - for all
<br>
petrol engine cars available which average at least 50 mpg and it
<br>
produced a list of 24 models (8 cars with varying levels of trim and
<br>
equipment). If you include diesels, it returns 100 models which do at
<br>
least 50mpg (about 25 cars in various configurations).  Purchase prices
<br>
start new at around 5,000 GBP (8,100 USD, 7,500 Euros) and drop by about
<br>
a third for one-year old cars.
<br>
(And I believe car prices are cheaper in Europe than in UK).
<br>
<p>So Europe and Japan seem to be embracing wholeheartedly the idea of
<br>
reducing oil consumption and coincidentally providing cheap
<br>
transportation for the masses. 
<br>
Looks like the high taxes have convinced the population here.
