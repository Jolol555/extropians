Lee Corbin notes I diverge from the &quot;I&quot; discussion to uploading.
<br>
True... still, consciousness and uploading are interlinked discussions,
<br>
both interlink with the idea of consent.
<br>
<p>I believe that Tipler in the particular scenario of the Omega Point
<br>
theory of his book envisages us upgrading ourselves (or perhaps
<br>
uploading) into energy states (as all the matter in the universe is
<br>
transmogrified cosmologically in any case) and these are integrated
<br>
into the universal (truly) turing machine/computer matrix, which then
<br>
one presumes uses the photon signatures etc. to reconstruct the bodies
<br>
of the earlier dead just as they are about to die (prior to brain death) 
<br>
in virtualities which are made to allow for such (correct particle 
<br>
configurations, etc.) and then presumably these beings get to go through 
<br>
their options. But this process which occurs through quantum splitting 
<br>
is not strictly speaking uploading but splitting. There will have to be some 
<br>
mechanism for the Omega Point matrix to reconfigure the dying person 
<br>
(split B) to stop the process of death (or alternatively to then upload the 
<br>
dying person into a body which has no injuries or is a substratum of 
<br>
computronium).
<br>
<p>Of course, Tipler may be wrong about the whole procedure. What is 
<br>
exciting about Tipler for me is:
<br>
<p>. quantum splitting
<br>
. the demonstration that nanotech probes can reach all or most of the full
<br>
universe
<br>
. articulation of the principle of transference of the apparently dead
<br>
. articulation of the principle of seeking full extropy (infinite growth) [as you
<br>
know, some writers speculate even heat death can be used for this purpose]..
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Lee wants to know why I'm an augmenter rather than uploader.
<br>
<p>I reject uploading because of the principle of continuity being breached [and the
<br>
duplicate is only a rough approximation not quantum and therefore according to
<br>
Tipler a &quot;split&quot;].
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Just as an aside, Tipler does not talk about uploading everyone. Somewhat
<br>
sadly, in view of his otherwise wise thinking, he bows not just to generic
<br>
statements of support for monotheism but also makes the statement that
<br>
bad people will be left behind (an argument shared by many Christian churches
<br>
and some proponents of computronium matrixes/uploading). Personally my main
<br>
thrust ethically has always been to promote the notion of universal consensual
<br>
protective shielding as an alternative to non-consensual force or &quot;leaving behind&quot;
<br>
people to oblivion [this ties in with preventing non-consensual heavens and hells,
<br>
if actual overtually or virtually].
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>As another aside, I note that computronium has the potential to be both a neural
<br>
seat for a personality or an inforoad. That is, it can augment your brain, it can be
<br>
the whole of your brain, it can be used to connect brains through sensory
<br>
exchange or data exchange and it can be used as a matrix for all of these.
<br>
<p>In a way you could have an &quot;internet, a &quot;sensornet&quot; and a &quot;thought-pattern-by-
<br>
consensual-exchangenet&quot;.

<p>As I hold time travel to be unethical, without gaining the consent of
<br>
every person affected, the question does not arise for me.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p>Lee writes on whether it is ethical to create a new being with
<br>
memories inbuilt:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What makes new random memories preferable to the old?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reminiscent of the way that many on this list highly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value the memories and experiences of 85 year olds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your seem to be claiming that null memories are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferable to an 85 year old's, or at least that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the {destruction of 85-year-old's memories + insertion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of new random memories} is to you preferable to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuation of the 85-year-old's experiences.
</em><br>
<p>Ok: re: new births: 
<br>
<p>Memory insertion should be by consent, and 
<br>
consent requires adulthood. Since immature beings should be
<br>
protected, I guess this preserves the current state of things
<br>
(instinct-only birth, followed by adult memoryhood). Because we
<br>
are rooted in time, there will always be a moment of immaturity.
<br>
This is where my argument is weakest. For adults to assume
<br>
divergent memory and identity, to remold their own, to graft such
<br>
and reform, is all very well. But wholly new entities (i.e. not merged
<br>
but neurologically independent and born)...
<br>
<p>they should have free will
<br>
they should have the abililty to self-boost (upon adulthood)
<br>
they should be able to attain adulthood (without this being unfairly delayed)
<br>
and they should be able to choose to accept or reject the memories or specific 
<br>
personality patterns of another when reaching adulthood.
<br>
<p>Otherwise aren't we like Catholics, baptising babies at birth as &quot;Catholics for
<br>
eternity&quot;?
<br>
<p>But if you don't believe uploading (creating) a non-quantum close-duplicate without
<br>
broadcast linkage to you (the &quot;original&quot;) is a birth process, then the above moral
<br>
issues don't arise as it's &quot;you&quot;.
<br>
<p>So there you have a real difference of opinion.
<br>
<p>It's not as bad as &quot;rewiring out&quot; a brain's patterning to superimpose your own, but it
<br>
is an issue. I guess one can only say, if there really are &quot;two&quot; persons involved, how
<br>
would you have felt about being born with the memories of your father? Would you 
<br>
have minded? Would you like your son or daughter to have your memories on birth, to
<br>
build upon?
<br>
<p>I guess there is also the issue of potential, obvious in the human fetus versus 2-3 year
<br>
old argument. Memory-insertion into a developing-birthed being? Can one make an adult
<br>
from scratch without memory-insertion? Can consciousness exist without discrete 
<br>
memory, even in non-human forms of consciousness maps?
<br>
<p>Food for thought...
