ANNN to build Nano House
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
BY DARRYL NELSON (profile) | October 13, 2002
<br>
<p>The new Australian National Nanotechnoloy Network has announced its first collaborative effort, which will see the establishment of the Nano House, to be built using nano-engineered materials and devices. &quot;The house will take nanotechnology out of the realms of the scientist and into the general public, said Dr Braach-Maksvytis, co-director at the CSIRO's Nanotechnology Centre and the Network's chief coordinator. 
<br>
<p>Citing public awareness and education as two areas for the Network to focus its efforts, Dr Braach-Maksvytis said: &quot;There is a speed and unpredictability in this field. Some things we thought would take 10 years to develop are here now.&quot;  
<br>
<p>The Nano House project is a joint venture between UTS's Institute for Nanoscale Technology and the CSIRO. As well as demonstrating the Institute's energy-efficiency strand of nano research, the house will be used to teach the wider public about what nano-engineered technologies can offer, particularly with regard to reducing energy waste in the home. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We want to make homes energy efficient using nanotechnology in the materials and design, and make a real impact on the Greenhouse problem,&quot; said Carl Masens, the Institute's liaison officer. &quot;The house will also make a showcase for all the nano work going on in all the labs in Australia.&quot;
<br>
<p>Visitors to the Nano House will be able to see developments such as liquid-resistant materials, windows that filter out the ultra violet light and smart paint, capable of things like not fading.

<br>
<p>The Network hope's for the first part of the house to be ready by the middle of next year, with businesses and research centres providing the materials in exchange for exposure. It will be completed in stages, according to nanotechnology developments and interest shown by businesses wanting to get involved. &quot;We know that nanotechnologies exist for windows and for pumping cold light into the house,&quot; said Masens, although he admitted exactly which part of the house will be constructed first has yet to be identified.
<br>
<p>Neither is it yet known where the house will be built. &quot;My vision is to set it up at Uhluru (Ayers Rock),&quot; he added, as a good location to attract visitors. But it is envisaged that parts of the home will go on display at various locations such as the Powerhouse Museum, as they are built.
<br>
<p>Masens advised that businesses interested in contributing any nano-engineered products to the house should contact him at the UTS Institute in Sydney. A website will also eventually be created, in order to track progress and allow virtual visits to the house.
