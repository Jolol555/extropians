<p>I find it interesting, but not surprising, that so many are quick to
<br>
criticize the policies of the current leadership of the free world. From a
<br>
mehum perspective, I guess it's just good fun to poke our thumbs in our ears
<br>
and make moosey faces at a target characterized as simply &quot;The
<br>
Administration&quot;, &quot;The US&quot; or &quot;Dubya and his goons&quot;. So much the easier then
<br>
to imagine a gang of Saturday night rednecks cruising around in a pickup
<br>
truck in search of some hapless homo to beat up.
<br>
<p>But from a transhumanist perspective, such over-simplifications ought to be
<br>
viewed as noise. I mean we ARE talking about an incredibly complex
<br>
sociotechnopolitical human-machine symbiotic organizational entity here -
<br>
one that, for better or worse, currently sits in the driver's seat of human
<br>
evolution.

</em><br>
mass
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Instead we debate &quot;the one single reason&quot; America is going to war against
<br>
Iraq, as if such a complex decision has ever existed within the realm of
<br>
SINGLE reasons. There are a multitude of reasons, and foremost is the fact
<br>
that Saddam is a pain in the world's butt. And yes, even though the
<br>
temptation may to limit that by stating that he's a pain in America's butt,
<br>
who here supposes that when America gets a pain in its butt, the rest of the
<br>
world can avoid getting a pain in its butt.
<br>
<p>Also, since Saddam's not-nearly-so-complex sociopolitical organization has
<br>
yet to honor the ORIGINAL CONDITIONS   that led to a cease fire during Gulf
<br>
War 1, technically speaking, that war is still ongoing. All those who have
<br>
now flip-flopped to oppose taking the bull by the horns show only that they
<br>
are incapable of sustaining their resolve for any length of time against a
<br>
cunning, methodical adversary.
<br>
<p>Personally, I think if it can be shown that Saddam murdered ONE SINGLE HUMAN
<br>
BEING in order to attain or maintain his nefarious role as self-appointed
<br>
demigod to the Iraqi people, he should be removed IMMEDIATELY. The same
<br>
would go for George Bush of course, although the American system would make
<br>
short work of any politician who even tried killing his way to the top.
<br>
Another straw that really ought to break the camel's back is if Saddam has
<br>
directly (and obviously he has done this indirectly) prevented ordinary
<br>
Iraqi citizens from accessing the internet and the global mind. In my view,
<br>
that should now constitute a crime against humanity.
<br>
<p>So brian197, I too am growing frustrated with the current &quot;wait around&quot;
<br>
policy. And who exactly is footing the bill for all this waiting around to
<br>
see if Saddam will suddenly recognize just how UNITED the world is against
<br>
his particular brand of ideocracy.
