Subject: [LOGES-DE-CORBEAUX] Arthur Miller on War and Peace
<br>
<p>Your guest, Arthur Miller asked rhetorically why Bush cannot wait until
<br>
the UN inspectors have done their job. Indeed, UN peace keeping forces
<br>
have been in some world situations to keep the peace for years, even
<br>
decades. If that is how long it takes, why is that a problem to Bush?
<br>
If he wages a &quot;war&quot; (really a mass murder given that his military is 1,000
<br>
times stronger than Iraq's) the cost in lives will be in the thousands and
<br>
perhaps even millions. The cost in material assets destroyed will be into
<br>
the billions of dollars. By both criteria, the UN peackeepers in Iraq cost
<br>
far, far less.
<br>
<p>There is an irrefutable fact here which even Bush and their war
<br>
propagandists will not argue against.
<br>
<p>AS LONG AS THE UN INSPECTORS/PEACE KEEPERS ARE IN IRAQ, PEACE AND
<br>
STABILITY IN THE REGION AND THE WORLD WILL BE MAINTAINED.
<br>
<p>It doesn't matter if Iraq has been in &quot;material breech&quot; of this or that.
<br>
The UN inspectors will destroy the prohibited weapons. There is another
<br>
irrefutable fact. As Madelaine Albright and others have said, there are
<br>
some highly unpredictable aspects to a U-S-A invasion, as unpredictable as
<br>
peace and stability are predictable by continuing with present procedures
<br>
indefinitely. What will happen she asked, if U-S-A is in occupation of
<br>
Baghdad, the cultural centre of the Muslim world? At a time when European
<br>
cities were in darkness and superstition, Baghdad was a centre for
<br>
scholarship and enlightenment. How will the Muslim world react
<br>
psychologically to a modern occupation of Baghdad? General Scowcroft even
<br>
opined on this being the start of the Apocalpyse. The point is that we
<br>
don't know for sure what &quot;war&quot; will bring but we do know for sure what
<br>
continuing INDEFINITELY with the present peace process will bring.
<br>
<p>The only certain &quot;benefit&quot; of this pseudo-war would be to satisfy the
<br>
blood-lust of an alcoholic psychopath who now sits in the Whitehouse
<br>
because he won the toss of a coin, in effect, in the last presidential
<br>
election.
