Wei Dai writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead of replying to your long post, which seems to mostly repeat what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you wrote earlier, let me point to this essay written by Richard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Holbrooke, who was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President Clinton. He argues that we don't need a second resolution, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't have asked for one. Presumably this person knows more about how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Security Council works than either of us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45433-2003Feb21.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45433-2003Feb21.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>This curious article contains, first, 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The administration is now caught in a dangerous dilemma,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partly because its military and diplomatic tracks are out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of sync and partly because of its failure to maintain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America's historical leadership role in its core alliances...
</em><br>
<p>and ultimately blames this state of affairs on Bush not being
<br>
as decisive as Clinton (his boss) who went right ahead into
<br>
Yugoslavia without even bringing the issue up before the
<br>
U.N. (where Russia would have surely vetoed any action).
<br>
<p>But then he also says
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Over the past 60 years, the United States has consistently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combined its military superiority with moral and political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leadership.  Unfortunately, in the present case some members
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the administration, and many of its most fervent outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporters, have abandoned this tradition and acted as though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete superiority in such things as night-vision goggles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and other modern military technology) allows the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States to ignore the importance of traditional relationships.
</em><br>
<p>But then he also takes time to criticize the U.S. for helping out
<br>
Tony Blair domestically.  (!?)
<br>
<p>I am rather confused.  Is he complaining mainly because Bush
<br>
is not Clinton?  B is not C?  C is not B?
<br>
