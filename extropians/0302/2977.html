<em>&gt; As I and others have pointed out, the so-called Kuwaiti invasion

</em><br>
<p>An outright lie. The US ambassador told Saddam that arab problems
<br>
require arab solutions, in a rare instance where we tried to follow the
<br>
leftist policy of letting these third worlders govern themselves and
<br>
solve their own problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We then inflated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what was going on and faked (as later came out) satellite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence of a massive Iraqi Army maneuvering to also invade 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saudi Arabia. 
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, Iraqis actually invaded Saudi Arabia, in the battle of
<br>
Kafji. Lucky we were there...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We faked such emotional tear=jerkers as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testimony before the Senate of Iraqi soldiers barging into a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hospital and taking babies out of an incubator and throwing them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the floor.  Faked it at just the right time to ok the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agressions we already have planned.  Since then we have not only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imposed sanctions that are quite ruinous to the well-being of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Iraqi people.  The US and Britain have unilaterally imposed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no-fly zones and conducted bombing runs on various manufacturing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centers on the grounds that perhaps they could somehow be used 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for producing weapons.
</em><br>
<p>Faking something is quite different from giving the Iraqis the time to
<br>
destroy evidence of their crimes. Is a murder still a murder when you
<br>
can't find the body? Apparently not. Eyewitnesses just don't seem to
<br>
matter either...
