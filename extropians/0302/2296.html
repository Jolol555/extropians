I was just thinking that if your cells were full of Drexlerian molecular
<br>
supercomputers and cell repair devices it might be good to have an emergency
<br>
storage mechanism. Then if the body died and the brain could not actively
<br>
survive (say it lost energy sources for decades) then it could lock in
<br>
organic neural settings both chemical and electrical and store that
<br>
knowledge in a non-decaying positional-informational matrix. Then you could
<br>
rebuild the organic cells. But if you really believe that continuity is
<br>
vital then this is a &quot;new&quot; person, a duplicate, because there has been an
<br>
inactive period for the entire neurological structure all at once. Maybe
<br>
this is better for partial injuries of the brain.
<br>
<p>When we sleep our neurons are still active.
<br>
<p>Perhaps we are better off relying on protective shielding or Dr Tipler or
<br>
broadcast linkage. (Uploaders, however, should have no problem with total
<br>
inactivity breaks.)
