<p><em>    &gt; As I and others have pointed out, the so-called Kuwaiti invasion
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; was greatly inflated and partially a setup by America. [...]
</em><br>
<p>So, this list is asked to listen to the wisdom of someone who calls the
<br>
invasion of Kuwait  &quot;so-called&quot; and the political expertise of someone who
<br>
says it was somehow (not specified how or why) an American &quot;setup&quot;;
<br>
I don't think so.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;We then inflated what was going on and faked (as later came out)
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;satellite evidence of a massive Iraqi Army maneuvering to also 
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;invade Saudi Arabia.
</em><br>
<p>Baloney. He had a massive army and after he swallowed Kuwait he could have 
<br>
taken over Saudi Arabia in just a few days if he wanted to and he certainly
<br>
wanted to, the only reason he didn't is fear of the USA, and if he knew the
<br>
president was listening to advise from you he would have no fear and the 
<br>
world would be a sadder and more dangerous place today.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;The US and Britain have unilaterally imposed  no-fly zones
</em><br>
<p>Well Boo Hoo, poor Saddam has lost some of his power. So this list is asked
<br>
to listen to the ethical advise of somebody who thinks no fly zones are a
<br>
moral outrage but invading Kuwait is not. I don't think so.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;and conducted bombing runs on various manufacturing centers
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;on the grounds that perhaps they could somehow be used for
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;producing weapons.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps? For good or bad very soon now we are going to know for sure if
<br>
Saddam has weapons of mass destruction or not, you seem to be predicting
<br>
he does not, I'm predicting he does.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Saddam is far less dangerous than Israel or North Korea or even
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; Pakistan.
</em><br>
<p>Saddam is the only leader in the world who wants weapons of mass
<br>
destruction, invaded his neighbors twice, has a chance to control the
<br>
world's supply of oil and has actually used chemical weapons on his own
<br>
people and on others.
