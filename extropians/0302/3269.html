American politicians are elected by the American People to serve American
<br>
interests. That is the very nature of a democratic goverment. The UN in
<br>
neither a world goverment nor is it democratic by any means.
<br>
If you do not like that system then work to create a democratic world state
<br>
but don't believe it exists yet.

&quot;&quot;Anyway, coming back to the topic: The USA are NOT attacked by Saddam, so
<br>
they have no bloody right to invade his country and piss at his garden
<br>
fence with a GPS penis. It is a crime and Troubleyou Bush will be a criminal
<br>
if he does so. This is the democratic point of view. The momentary Bush
<br>
doctrine is an imperialistic stance which scares the rest of the world,
<br>
because it shows a tendency to drift away from democratic principles.&quot;&quot;

It's only democracy if you live inside the US. It is dictatorship, although
<br>
admittedly not totalitarian and even possibly benign for many, if you live
<br>
outside the US.
