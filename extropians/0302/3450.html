<em>&gt; I know better than to answer a question like that online. ;-) The password

<em>&gt; addresses/usernames/passwords on the sites that concern me most.
</em><br>
<p>This means it's probably shorter than 8 characters, which could be
<br>
reasonable to hack by brute-force.  If it were longer, you'd probably
<br>
respond &quot;of course it's much longer than 8 characters -- you wouldn't
<br>
bother trying to brute-force it, would you?&quot;  :-)

<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; My PC is generally not physically accessible to anyone other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What do you mean by &quot;generally&quot;?  How often is your PC physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accessible to someone else?  Once a week?  Once a month?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically, never. I can't think of a time that anyone had access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this computer without my close supervision, which is not to say it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never happened.
</em><br>
<p>Even under close supervision, if someone else was using your computer
<br>
and went to a malicious site that'd drop a quiet in-the-background
<br>
installer of a keylogger, do you think you'd be able to (1) know enough
<br>
to spot it happening, (2) be quick enough to catch it happening?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Occam's Razor would say your little conspiracy theory is a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unlikely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you knew more about my life and the placement of my computer then I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you find my remote keylogging theory to be the best explanation.
</em><br>
<p>If I knew more about your life, would I be able to guess your password?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am running Windows XP Home Edition. Until a couple of week ago I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; connected 24/7 via DSL, but in the last few weeks I have been using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; dialup only.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; h0 h0 h0!  Windows XP 0wned Edition connected 24/7 by DSL.  I bet you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probably didn't keep up with the latest security patches as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immediately came out, did you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually I do. I'm set up to automatically download and install every patch.
</em><br>
<p>I'm too paranoid to do that -- I'm still waiting for someone to 0wn
<br>
Microsoft Windows Update and widely distribute a backdoor/trojan from
<br>
Microsoft's own servers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Did you know enough to rename your owner account?  And put a password on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've had several different user accounts on my own PC over several different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; installations, each one a renamed admin account. One of them used the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; password as that used on the hacked site. Stealth software capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recovering that owner password would have helped the hacker.
</em><br>
<p>Did you disable the Guest account?  If not, remotely someone could have
<br>
grabbed the appropriate file on your drive that contains the passwords,
<br>
and as you mention, go through the process of password-recovery of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Anyone running Windows XP (Home or Pro, but /especially/ XP Home) should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at least glance over this web page at least three times:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     <a href="http://www.blackviper.com/WinXP/supertweaks.htm">http://www.blackviper.com/WinXP/supertweaks.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Specifically, number 12 which I'll quote here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very interesting (and another thing to be alarmed about).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However I don't believe I've ever used the default owner/admin account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without first renaming it.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, this is only useful to do if you've also disabled the guest
<br>
account as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If I were a betting person, I'd bet you a nickel that you got socially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; engineered or shoulder surfed, and not keylogged.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, social engineering is quite possible, as is shoulder surfing, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm usually extremely careful about the latter.
</em><br>
<p>I'm betting that the password was not a random sequence of letters and
<br>
numbers, and was probably a mnemonic of some sort, which is conceivably
<br>
guessable given enough knowledge about you and the kind of thing you may
<br>
choose as a password.  A few very pointed (but still benign) questions 
<br>
might be enough to reveal it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In case I haven't made it clear, my focus on anti-keylogging is due in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part to the fact that I have another password, one which I use for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high security purposes (e.g., encryption of data files). I'm most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned about that password, and it's not one that would normally be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accessible via such things as social engineering and shoulder surfing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Probably only a keylogger could capture it, because I use it only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rarely, (never on websites), and because I am in general very careful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about its use.
</em><br>
<p>You sound like a person who thinks they have something worth hiding.
<br>
What could you possibly be protecting that's worth losing sleep over?
<br>
Schematics for a space-temporal-transport-matter-thing-a-ma-dingy that
<br>
you received from your future self, or something?
<br>
<p>About the most worried I get with regard to passwords is the fact that
<br>
my bank uses my ATM's PIN code as the /same/ password for their online
<br>
banking interface.  Can you say &quot;brute force a password less than 8
<br>
characters and is entirely numeric&quot;?  I knew you could.
<br>
<p>I'm waiting for people to set up high-powered telescopes aimed at public
<br>
ATM keypads from a distance to surf people's PIN codes as well as a
<br>
glance at their ATM card to get their account number, then see if
<br>
they're signed up for web banking then *slurrrrrrrrrp* run off with
<br>
their money.  I cannot believe it hasn't happened yet, especially in
<br>
places like New York City.
<br>
<p>Regardless, whatever it is you're trying to either hide, or protect ...
<br>
sounds like you shouldn't be storing it on a machine that's ever
<br>
connected to a public network.  Otherwise, you might as well not be
<br>
protecting it -- locks only keep honest people out -- since you're only
<br>
inconveniencing yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thanks for all your advice.
</em><br>
<p>Free advice is worth exactly what you paid for it.  :-)
