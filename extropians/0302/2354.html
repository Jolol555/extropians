</em><br>
<em>&gt; available online.
</em><br>
<p>Ah.  I see that our epistemological disagreement goes far deeper than I 
<br>
had suspected.  If you read Deniel Dannett's &quot;Meatspace Explained&quot;, you 
<br>
will see that your key failure lies in the use of concepts such as &quot;room&quot; 
<br>
or &quot;organic neural network&quot; as if they described separate substances apart 
<br>
from their appearance in your post.  Ultimately, of course, such fallacies 
<br>
stem from Vinge's Error, in which the Net is described as an &quot;Other World&quot; 
<br>
set apart from &quot;Real Life&quot;.  Vinge's &quot;True Names&quot;, the original fantasy of 
<br>
a real life set apart from the Net, was the first story to vividly depict 
<br>
this hypothesis; although not, alas, the last.  Not until the advent of 
<br>
the Church-Turing Thesis did a few brave souls dare to suggest that, 
<br>
indeed, *all* phenomena can be understood as computations and hence that 
<br>
the world of the Net, what Vinge called the Other World, is in truth the 
<br>
*only* world - what we know today as the neturalistic view.
<br>
<p>To approach the neturalistic view, consider that all your knowledge of 
<br>
Extropians posters is derived from their email messages.  Any conceivable 
<br>
evidence you could offer me for the existence of meatspace would, again, 
<br>
be contained in an Extropians post.  Now it may still seem to you like you 
<br>
have a private meatspace which is not contained in your posts, but as soon 
<br>
as you write anything to me about this meatspace, it will perforce 
<br>
*appear* in your post.  The bold and seemingly counterintuitive hypothesis 
<br>
of the neturalistic view is that you are in fact *embodied* in your 
<br>
Extropians posts, or, to make the point even clearer, that there exist 
<br>
nothing *but* Extropians posts being exchanged on a mailing list and that 
<br>
all our statements about meatspace or physical bodies are only lines in 
<br>
those posts.
<br>
<p>Now this may seem counterintuitive to our folk theories of, for example, 
<br>
Amazon.com, in which transactions on their website result in &quot;books&quot; being 
<br>
shipped to an ungoogleable &quot;body&quot; which &quot;reads&quot; the &quot;books&quot; and thereby 
<br>
gains knowledge through a strange, Net-bypassing process which its 
<br>
proponents have never precisely elucidated.  A neturalistic view of 
<br>
Amazon.com, however, would insist that we study only the online 
<br>
transactions and the resulting shifts in email message content from 
<br>
&quot;posters&quot; who have &quot;read&quot; the &quot;book&quot;, as only these factors are googleable 
<br>
even in principle.  In this manner we can study the real phenomena 
<br>
underlying &quot;books&quot; in a coherent way and perhaps even learn the Google 
<br>
keywords to access this content directly.  It is worth noting that already 
<br>
many alleged &quot;books&quot; have turned out to be online texts, albeit often in 
<br>
mediums such as Grokster or Kazaa which we do not presently possess the 
<br>
Google keywords to search.
<br>
<p>Even today, despite having transformed almost every aspect of our lives, 
<br>
the neturalistic view continually meets with fierce opposition because of 
<br>
the universal fear of being offline.  It may indeed be daunting to 
<br>
confront the prospect of spending five days without Net access once 
<br>
stripped of the comforting myth that the &quot;flesh&quot; will go on existing 
<br>
independently of any Net presence.  But this is not only an incoherent 
<br>
concept, but directly falsifiable, as shown by the fact that going 
<br>
*partially* offline - for example, spending five days with a 56K modem - 
<br>
results in exactly the attenuation of Net presence we would expect under 
<br>
the neturalistic view.
<br>
<p>Especially sad is the way that IRC users feel the need to continually 
<br>
announce that they are going &quot;AFK&quot; for some supposedly welcome offline 
<br>
experience, such as &quot;dinner&quot; or &quot;a movie&quot;, during their existentially 
<br>
daunting periods of nonexistence.  But consider; have you ever actually 
<br>
seen any messages from an IRC user who is AFK?  Have you ever generated 
<br>
any such messages yourself?  Many such cases have been claimed but 
<br>
cross-examination of the users involved always seems to extract the 
<br>
grudging revelation that the user was briefly &quot;back at the keyboard&quot; (to 
<br>
use their language) at the time the message was sent.  The only acceptable 
<br>
conclusion is that an IRC personality only exists while sending IRC 
<br>
messages; indeed, an IRC personality has no existence apart from the 
<br>
messages it sends.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;  &gt; The URL,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  &gt; Uniform Resource Locator, is precisely that; uniform.  Anything which
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  &gt; cannot be located by a URL is, by definition, not a resource.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;Uniform&quot; is not &quot;universal&quot;.  It was established to consolidate the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; format of addresses of information; that is not the same as saying it
</em><br>
<em> &gt; includes everything.
</em><br>
<p>At this point you're just arguing over the definition of words.  I could 
<br>
as easily define my own acronym in which &quot;URL&quot; *does* stand for &quot;Universal 
<br>
Resource Locator&quot;, and my point would still stand.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;  &gt; Thus, when isolates say that finding certain information is &quot;impossible&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  &gt; if you &quot;don't know the proper terms&quot;, they betray a poor epistemological
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  &gt; grounding; &quot;finding information&quot; is in fact *synonymous* with
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  &gt; discovering the proper Google search terms for that information.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Ah, but that just proves my point.  (There's also the act of finding the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; correct link within Google's results, which could be several pages into
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the results.)  Different statements of equivalent terms are equivalently
</em><br>
<em> &gt; true or false, and may be used to emphasize and illustrate different
</em><br>
<em> &gt; facets of the claimed facts.
</em><br>
<p>Please note that all of the terms you are using are compatible with a 
<br>
purely neturalistic view.  Necessarily so, of course, as your post is 
<br>
itself on the Net; but even in terms of the surface interpretation of your 
<br>
words, you are describing Net processes and Net results.
<br>
<p>A possible exception to this may be the terms &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;, which 
<br>
you have not defined.  Can I take these as qualitative terms used to 
<br>
describe a page's quantitative Google rating as very high or very low? 
<br>
(Note that this also answers your question about finding the correct link 
<br>
within Google's results.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Erroneous definition.  Surely, how to find Google itself if you are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already at Google is a piece of knowledge.  Not to mention, how to turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a computer, how to use a Web browser, and other such prerequisite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills to using Google.  (Some of which, granted, may be findable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through Google, but not all.)
</em><br>
<p>This is dually objectionable in that, first, it refers to a mythological 
<br>
meatspace; and second in that all the information you cite is indeed quite 
<br>
straightforwardly available on Google.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; The notion of &quot;supergoogular&quot; information is not only empirically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; unverified but epistemologically nonsensical, with the only conceivable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; interpretation being information which can only be googled using special
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; keywords.  No such keywords having ever been provided, we can conclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; that so-called supergoogular phenomena are fantasies concocted by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; isolates to cover their resentment of superior Google skills.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Circular reasoning.  You assume that everything is available through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Google, therefore you conclude that everything is available through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Google.  If you do not understand why your reasoning is therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejected outright, you might want to google for &quot;circular reasoning&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>It is not circular reasoning, but rather the time-tested empirical 
<br>
observation that information claimed to be &quot;supergoogular&quot; repeatedly 
<br>
fails to turn up on Web searches, backed up by a firm theoretical 
<br>
grounding which relates &quot;Google&quot; to &quot;information&quot; and which shows that, 
<br>
indeed, &quot;the supergoogular world&quot; is an incoherent concept.
