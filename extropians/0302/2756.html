Thought this snippet of a discussion on Starship Forum might be of

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming that weapons development can drive

</em><br>
<p>Weapons of mass destruction change everything.
<br>
In space, the scale of mass destruction grows
<br>
without bound.
<br>
<p>Differing levels of the knowledge and availability
<br>
of weapons changes military strategies and the
<br>
societies which support them.  Feedback is part of
<br>
the process as societies adapt to the requirements
<br>
of the military technologies/strategies they have
<br>
developed to deal with outside/inside pressures.
<br>
Military technology/strategy is a part of the
<br>
political structure of any society.
<br>
<p>Kings could send their well trained soldiers in
<br>
heavy armor to rape and pillage peasants as they
<br>
saw fit, until crossbows made armor and long bow
<br>
training largely obsolete.  Kings could hide in
<br>
castles, largely impervious, until black powder
<br>
and cannon [offensive weapons] rendered that
<br>
kind of defense obsolete.  The strategies of
<br>
kings and tyrants had to adapt to the military
<br>
technology/strategies of their time.
<br>
<p>To this day the first step in any successful
<br>
tyranny is to dis-arm the populace.  It is not
<br>
just the soldier which can be laid to rest by
<br>
common weapons, but the tyrant himself.
<br>
<p>In space, the family truckster could be a kinetic
<br>
energy WoMD by its very nature.  The power plant
<br>
to run farms could  be a dual use producer of
<br>
fissionable materials for atomic weapons.  Mining
<br>
equipment could steer a large rock down a
<br>
gravitational well and destroy whole  civilizations.
<br>
How can space tyrants disarm a populace when dual
<br>
use includes WoMD capabilities?
<br>
<p>The next question is how to defend against
<br>
individuals and terror groups wielding these
<br>
same common industrial WoMD.
<br>
<p>Space societies, including Earth bound societies,
<br>
will have to adapt to these changes or be wiped out.
<br>
WoMD are getting cheaper and cheaper.  With an
<br>
increasingly wealthy society their cost will become
<br>
trivial and the knowledge of WoMD common.
<br>
<p>It has to change the arrangement of human societies.
<br>
Aliens will have the same problem - hence my solution
<br>
to the Fermi Paradox - only those who hide live in
<br>
the long run.  SETI's theory is to look for local loud-
<br>
mouths living contrary to this military model.  They
<br>
might eventually find a loudmouth, an accidental signal,
<br>
or a lure designed to expose other civilizations.  We
<br>
should expect these to be rare give the implications
<br>
of WoMD.
