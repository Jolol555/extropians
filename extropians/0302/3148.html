<p><em>&gt; From: Lee Corbin [mailto:<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=RE:%20Bush%20budget%20has%200%20dollars%20for%20Afghanistan">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I agree, but you are proposing to *change* the culture of an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entire nation.  This sounds distantly familiar: a century ago 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it was believed that war and poverty could be abolished by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; educating people properly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are in fact strong correlations between wealth, education, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy.  Countries that have a high median standard of living are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost all democracies.  
</em><br>
<p>But which is cause, and which is effect?  The best answers we have,
<br>
in my opinion, can be found in the works of savants who have studied
<br>
this problem for decades (see below).  I think that they're finally
<br>
onto something!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, Afghanistan has a democratically elected government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today.  That government has very little real power because it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have an adequate standing army or police force.  The military power is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hands of the regional warlords.  Hamid Karzai asked the US to help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct this and the US refused.  Why would we do that?  
</em><br>
<p>Good question.  I don't know.  I have several ideas, but only
<br>
speculation.  In historical parallels, surely any resisting Nazis
<br>
in the mountains of southern Germany would have been dealt with!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I just don't agree with this.  You can hire local workers to build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roads, a power grid, schools, and hospitals.  That sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure has a huge effect on a nation.  The process of building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it also pumps money into the economy in a more distributed and organic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner than the IMF or World Bank can.
</em><br>
<p>Are you sure that any exterior *power* really has the ability
<br>
to do such farsighted surgery on a nation, and change its
<br>
culture in the process?  It would be instructive to consider
<br>
cases in world history where this has been done.  Do you know
<br>
of any?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If you help a country too much, even in fighting its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rebels or its wars, it becomes dependent.  It does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; develop the ability on its own, which is absolutely crucial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goodness.  What we're talking about here are the basics.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroyed a country and toppled its government.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't that an exaggeration?  While the government was replaced,
<br>
do you think much else really changed there?  (And did not change
<br>
for the better?)  Third world countries are incredibly poor by
<br>
our standards, and what little economic activity is there cannot
<br>
be easily disrupted, at least not longer than for a few days.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I think that the crucial difference is that Japan and Germany 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were already extremely developed nations, and had the talent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to assimilate the habits of democracy.  Surely you don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suppose that Afghanistan is as capable as they were.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Japan and Germany were both fairly rich, educated countries, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly helped in their reconstruction.  At the same time, Japan had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no democratic tradition at all.  In both places it took decades of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heavy US involvement to get the country back on its feet.
</em><br>
<p>No, the Japanese were placed back &quot;on their feet&quot; almost immediately.
<br>
And that's because of them, not because of the occupiers.  All of
<br>
their vital economic infrastructure---highly developed internal
<br>
markets, factory know-how, an educated and hard-working population---
<br>
was already in place.  It simply took those people five or ten years
<br>
to rebuild.  Yes, the Marshall plan did help; but I'm convinced that
<br>
they would have soon made it anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Iraq also has a fairly well educated population.  It has natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources that can produce tremendous revenue.  What it will lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the US invasion is a democratic tradition, a force to guarantee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the country's stability while a new government is put in place, and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge amount of infrastructure that will have been destroyed in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack.   
</em><br>
<p>If that's so, then again it will be a year or so before *they*
<br>
rebuild.  But prosperity requires far more than having a well-
<br>
educated populace.  
<br>
<p>What really accounts for the differences between rich and poor
<br>
countries.  The following authors tell a very similar story:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Easterly     &quot;The Elusive Quest for Growth&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hernando DeSoto      &quot;The Mystery of Capital&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mancur Olson         &quot;Power and Prosperity&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom Bethell          &quot;The Noblest Triumph&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis Fukuyama     &quot;Trust&quot;
<br>
<p>I would summarize the lessons they teach as saying that the
<br>
following are absolutely necessary for prosperity:
<br>
<p>1. The legal rights of individuals must be sacrosanct,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all individuals must be equal before the law.
<br>
2. Government corruption must be minimal.
<br>
3. Private property must be totally respected under
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the law.
<br>
4. Private property must be an integral part of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legal system, and publicly registered.  This includes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all businesses and real estate.  (This is DeSoto's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conclusion after 20 years' study.)
<br>
5. A high level of trust for others outside one's own
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;family must be achievable, otherwise it is not possible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to create firms of any size.
<br>
<p>Everyone---conservatives, liberals, do-gooders, isolationists,
<br>
World Bank economists, leaders of advanced nations plotting
<br>
strategy---everyone, has been naive about the true sources
<br>
of wealth creation in nations.  And so difficult has this
<br>
analysis been, and so long in coming, we may not be assured
<br>
that even now the savants above have found the answers.
<br>
<p>For it can well-inhere in the cultural foundations of a 
<br>
society or civilization.  While Turkey, or perhaps soon
<br>
Iran or Iraq, may aspire to Western level prosperity, it
<br>
could be deep-seated relationships between the culture that
<br>
animates the lives of their millions of citizens, their
<br>
religions, and their histories that simply cannot be changed
<br>
except over the course of many, many decades, if at all.
