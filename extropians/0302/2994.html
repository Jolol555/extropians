<br>
<em>&gt; Besides wouldn't you be the first to criticize if the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US went in there rebuilding the country in our image?
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  I believe in projecting democracy and capitalism, rather
<br>
than merely projecting military force.  I believe that democracy and
<br>
capitalism outcompete the alternatives.  
<br>
<p>What I complain about is when the US goes into a country and props up
<br>
a dictator.  Or even worse, when the US overthrows a democratically
<br>
elected government to install a dictator.  Sadly, both of these are
<br>
standard events for the US.  Consider the following examples:
<br>
<p>- In the 1960s the CIA assisted in the assassination of democratically
<br>
elected president Allende of Chile and the installation of dictator
<br>
Augusto Pinochet.  Pinochet was notorious for his death squads and his
<br>
reign of terror using murder, torture, and rape.
<br>
<p>- In 1953 the US helped the Shah of Iran mount a coup against Mohammed
<br>
Mossadegh, the democratically elected prime minister.  For the next 27
<br>
years we supported the Shah, a corrupt dictator who stole from and
<br>
oppressed his own people, because he allowed us to use Iran as a base
<br>
for force projection close to the Soviet border.  The rise of
<br>
fundamentalist Islam in Iran can be directly traced to our support of
<br>
a regime that repressed the people and left fundamentalist Islamic
<br>
groups as the few willing and able to resist the dictator we'd
<br>
installed.
<br>
<p>- In the 1980s, the US sold chemical and biological weapons (as well
<br>
as conventional weapons) to Iraq and Saddam Hussein.  We knew very
<br>
well that those weapons were being used against the Kurds as well as
<br>
Iranian troops.  We knew very well that our actions violated
<br>
international treaties that we were party to.  But at the time we
<br>
feared Iran (a monster we created more than Iraq).
<br>
<p>- While we were selling chemical and biological weapons to Iraq, we
<br>
sold conventional arms to Iran (against our own laws) and used the
<br>
profits to fund a terrorist group called the Contras in Nicaragua
<br>
(also against our own laws).  We did this despite knowing in detail
<br>
about the torture, rape, murder, kidnapping, and mutilation that the
<br>
Contras used against their enemies.
<br>
<p>I could go on.  Suffice it to say, US foreign policy has not been one
<br>
of encouraging the spread of democracy and capitalism to the rest of
<br>
the world.  Much the opposite.  I would welcome a foreign policy that
<br>
was actually consistent with the principles this country was founded
<br>
on.
