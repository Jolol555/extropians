<a href="mailto:bill@wkidston.freeserve.co.uk?Subject=Re:%20Fuel%20Efficient%20Cars%20(was%20Oil%20Economics)">bill@wkidston.freeserve.co.uk</a> writes: But remember, Europe is not all small 
<br>
cars. Rolls Royce, Ferrari, Jaguar, Mercedes, and other large cars are all 
<br>
plentiful. You just have to spend lots of money on them. It's a lifestyle 
<br>
choice thing. If you have the money you spend it on what you want.
<br>
<p>Bill,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not picking on the Europeans or the Americans in asking my next 
<br>
question.  I've watched the various auto and fuel taxes or quote safety 
<br>
requirements unquote come and go.  After a long period of time I have to ask 
<br>
myself if prices are not kept high to push the lower economic class out of 
<br>
large cars, houses, etc.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all if I had an income of a $1,000,000 per year it would matter 
<br>
little to my budget if gas cost $5.00 per litre, gallon or 55 gallon drum.  
<br>
But if my income is $40,000 per year it means a great deal.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one fact that really came as a revelation to me was how much Henry 
<br>
Ford did to free the American working man when he put cheap flexible 
<br>
transportation on the road.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider before the T-Model Ford a person was limited in their job 
<br>
market to the distance they could walk, bicycle or perhaps find commuter 
<br>
transportation.  The personal auto not only extended the distance a worker 
<br>
could go and accept employment it also made it possible for the worker to 
<br>
travel distances looking for employment and then to move there.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was an infant my father routinely worked as far as two hundred 
<br>
miles from home.  He could easily go that far looking for work, find cheap 
<br>
lodging and then return home on weekends.  He had a job that paid very well 
<br>
when work could be found.  Prior to the T-Model Ford he was limited to 
<br>
working close to home.
<br>
