<p>Here are the relevant paragraphs from the U.N. charter:
<br>
<p>All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the 
<br>
threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political 
<br>
independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the 
<br>
Purposes of the United Nations. 
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of 
<br>
individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a 
<br>
Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken 
<br>
measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures 
<br>
taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be 
<br>
immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way 
<br>
affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the 
<br>
present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in 
<br>
order to maintain or restore international peace and security.
<br>
(end quote)
<br>
<p>So it seems that you're only allowed to use force for self-defence, or if
<br>
approved by the Security Council. My point is that since the U.S. has
<br>
violated this several times in the past without serious repercussions,
<br>
what makes this time different?
