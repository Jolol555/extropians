Lee Corbin said amongst other wise advices:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have to know, when you see yourself start writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this, knowingly advocating greater pain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering, that something is out of kilter.  Yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do appreciate that from your point of view, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are *ABSOLUTELY* no reasons whatsoever to invade Iraq,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so from your point of view we are all raving mad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Is this true, or not?  Or am I reading too much into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what *you* are saying, now?)  But that's what it sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like.
</em><br>
<p>Lee, I knew it would get me that far when I decided not to leave the field
<br>
to the war supporters of this list. I knew exactly that I would be
<br>
transformed into the same kind of dragon myself who I was fighting against.
<br>
But I can bear these complementary poles, It is an excellent exercise for
<br>
the unity of psychological opposite pairs you will probably have to bear as
<br>
a transhuman entity.
<br>
<p>I put on the shoe that Mike Lorrey threw at us war opponents*? So I tried
<br>
to come up with an equivalent of the pain of the poor
<br>
American soldiers and Iraqi civilians, he and the other hawks are willing to
<br>
accept. I am aware of this with every word I write, but I have it under
<br>
control, because I do it in the spirit of Carlos Castaneda's &quot;controlled
<br>
foolishness&quot; (retranslated from German, so I don`t know if it is the
<br>
original term) It is my drastic way of saying &quot;wake up!&quot; to those who
<br>
accept 300.000 dead and one million refugees and a lot of more misery
<br>
in Iraq. Actually I would never turn on this future Buddha machine
<br>
of all encompassing sympathy with the wounded. But there are moments
<br>
when I wished I had the guts to do it to my own body-mind-continuum
<br>
to experience what war suffering really means.
<br>
<p>Isn`t it strange: while writing down my fantasies about this side effect of
<br>
an uploading machine, I had to think about you and Rafal musing on capital
<br>
punishment a couple of months ago, how it was *me* who got infuriated by
<br>
your kind of sarcasm. At that time I thought about leaving the list and
<br>
started to insult you and you wrote back very calmly which impressed me, I
<br>
must say. I think I remember that you demanded freedom of thinking and
<br>
writing about all the funny things you wanted to impose on people who were
<br>
sentenced to death. Well, now I am on a similar level of writing here. I am
<br>
aware of it but I do not regret it. It only shows me what already the
<br>
*prospect* of a war is doing to the mind of an originally peaceful man.
<br>
<p>It's a shame and you can blame me for this. That's okay. I don`t have
<br>
anything to loose. This is a crucial moment of world history and I will not
<br>
shut up. Call it *aggressive pacifism* or *pacifimania* or whatever you
<br>
want. My family name is my life's program.
<br>
