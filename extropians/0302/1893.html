<em>&gt; Re-used?  Pah!  Re-used by whom?  NASA builds its stuff new for each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mission, and would sooner see its detritus 
</em><br>
<p>IMO, the space shuttle was invented mostly because NASA needed working 
<br>
space in orbit. We now have the working space in the ISS, so there's no 
<br>
need anymore to launch an almost complete space station every time.
<br>
<p>One alternative could be a modular version of &quot;ordinary&quot; rockets. The 
<br>
whole construction would go into orbit, perhaps with reusable boosters 
<br>
like on the shuttle.
<br>
<p>The expensive parts (control unit, engines) would be separate modules and 
<br>
could be regained (fished from orbit by remote control). Each module 
<br>
could be overhauled, replaced and tested on its own. If its broken, we 
<br>
would only throw away a module. This would make mass production possible 
<br>
and probably reduce maintenance costs.
<br>
<p>The main tank could be used as habitable space or for production. I'm 
<br>
sure that a secure environment could be build with inflatable bubbles to 
<br>
cover the walls, insulating foam and such. BTW, does someone remember 
<br>
Skylab? The modified second stage of a Saturn 5?
<br>
<p>The payload could be packaged like in ordinary rockets today. If there's 
<br>
no crew, then no life support and no reentry system is needed, which 
<br>
would reduce costs per payload.
<br>
<p>A reentry system for the engines, experiments or products would be much 
<br>
cheaper than for the crew. Like a reverse progress transporter. The crew 
<br>
reentry vehicle could probably also be cheaper, more like the early 
<br>
capsules, but more comfortable.
