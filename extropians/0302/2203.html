<p>Looking at old ecological data might be helpful. Unfortunately little
<br>
is known. A popular theory seem to be that the &quot;natural&quot; state of the
<br>
Amazon during the last ice age was mostly a svannah, with isolated
<br>
(but still sizeable) forest refuges at the edges. However, this
<br>
picture has been challenged:

<br>
<p>So, given the current uncertainty any climate ought to be possible. 
<br>
However, a darkening of the sky would likely kill off many trees. If 
<br>
this was just a few months seedlings would start sprouting almost 
<br>
immediately after (and during) the removal of the canopy, and they 
<br>
would within a few years (if the climate remained good enough)  sprout 
<br>
and start to become new trees.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Presumably they would die but a lot of the big trees would remain 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; left of these jungles? 
</em><br>
<p>What about this possibility: the old trees largely die, to be replaced 
<br>
by opportunists and stranglers like figs. The colder climate makes 
<br>
many of these fail, leaving a sparser ecosystem dominated by vertical 
<br>
&quot;weeds&quot; that use the remains of the trees to climb and get nutrients. 
<br>
The major loss of canopy would destroy many of the ecological niches 
<br>
for the cool unique animals, but seed-gathering birds, ants, 
<br>
wood-eating insects and the animals that prey on them would certainly 
<br>
remain.
<br>
<p>I think you have a fairly broad range of possibilities to play with 
<br>
here; you can fit the forest environment to the scenario you are 
<br>
setting up.
