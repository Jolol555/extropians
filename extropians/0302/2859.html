</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, the Taliban are not yet beaten. Their chief, Mullah Omar, 
<br>
has just issued another call for a djihad against the USA and the new 
<br>
government in Afghanistan. Several intelligence agencies have reported 
<br>
that the Taliban and other paramilitary groups are reorganizing their 
<br>
forces. Remember the attack two weeks ago?
<br>
<p>There seems to be a rising risk for another civil war, with ISAF in the 
<br>
middle... The real war in Afghanistan, the form of war that the russians 
<br>
couldn't win, has not yet begun.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is *one* area where we need some hardnosed policy debate (one of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many). I wish the peace marchers would devote their energies to this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of issue.
</em><br>
<p>That's one of the main arguments in the discussions here, but not many 
<br>
pro-war shouters seem to have listend: A war against Iraq now will mess 
<br>
up the whole region and drive thousands of new recruits into the arms of 
<br>
al-quaeda and the other muslim extremists groups. That's why we need 
<br>
more time to present real evidence, to form a coalition, keep all 
<br>
parties involved in line, etc.  That's why even the majority of the 
<br>
Iraqi opposition in exile is against a war at this time.
<br>
<p>It would/will take years to bring stability into Iraq, even if not all 
<br>
odds would be against such a goal. The organized Iraqi military - or 
<br>
whatever is left of it - is not real threat. But when Saddam and his 
<br>
murderous regime will be bombed away, Iraq will become prey to Iran, the 
<br>
Kurds, Turkey, Saudi-Arabia, Kuwait and dozens of groups of religious or 
<br>
political fanatics. This mess can not be solved with high-tech military 
<br>
alone.
<br>
<p>And there's a very good chance that if there are really hidden WMDs, 
<br>
that these groups will gain access to them long before the US troops 
<br>
will even know where they are. I've said it two weeks ago: Instead of 
<br>
one Saddam, this war will breed some dozen potential bin-Ladins and one 
<br>
of them might succeed in another 9-11 like attack. But well, this will 
<br>
at least give US &quot;Homeland Security&quot; some new arguments to further trade 
<br>
freedom for pretended safety and burn some more borrowed billions for 
<br>
non-productive, non-progressive things.
