Another thought on this topic, and referencing Spike
<br>
<p>(By the way, I have been lurking here for a few months, great
<br>
discussions!)
<br>
<p>I have given much thought to how extremists can screw things up. At
<br>
first I tried to alert some people, then I realized that the less said
<br>
the better. Many extremists and terrorists are copycats. Once people
<br>
started shottings in high schools and going postal, many others
<br>
followed.
<br>
<p>I spoke to someone in the Government who said that the TV show that
<br>
discussed how vulnerable subways are (Nova or 20-20?), they called
<br>
Terrorism 101. He said it was the _worst_ thing journalists could ever
<br>
have done!
<br>
<p>So I really do not talk about what things could happen to us. That is
<br>
better left for think tanks and commitees behind closed doors. The
<br>
discussions of how they could harm us, that is.
<br>
<p>A concern though is that perhaps they are not thinking of these things!
<br>
It does not take a intellectual giant to realize that a big city is more
<br>
of a target than a small town. Yet the dillema is that the momentum of
<br>
our society is still taking us towards greater centralization; more
<br>
skyscrapers, more subways, more more more. 
<br>
<p>So while I absolutely do not want to help the extremists, I do weant to
<br>
help our country (and world), but many in office are still thinking very
<br>
linearly. That 20 years from today will be as different as today is from
<br>
20 years ago. I doubt that!
<br>
<p>Things have changed, we must be very careful how we react, but react we
<br>
must.
<br>
<p>Having said all that, I see a dillemma; to prepare we must think about
<br>
what can hurt us, but by thinking about what can hurt us, we give ideas
<br>
to those that can hurt us! 
<br>
<p>Again, transparency, overlaid on a secular framework that respects as
<br>
many different belief systems as possible is the least bad solution I
<br>
can think of....

</em><br>
<p>Ja.  My comments were spurred by the Nova program.  I ordinarily never
<br>
think about subways.  I seldom ride one, for I don't live or work in a
<br>
big city.
<br>
<p>After I posted about the vulnerability of a subway system,
<br>
I began second guessing the wisdom of discussing publicly
<br>
such matters.  Then a good friend read my mind and suggested
<br>
I cork it, forthwith.  This brings us back around to another thread of a
<br>
few weeks ago, the one about scientists refraining from discussing
<br>
technologies that could be used to harm mankind.
<br>
<p>That being said, I will go off on a tangent of sorts.  My scenario was
<br>
one of mass disruption, a short-lived isotope that is easily available,
<br>
relatively cheap, legal, at least temporarily indistinguishable from
<br>
lethal radiation sources, but one that does not actually cause any
<br>
deaths.  My notion is that subways in particular are inherently
<br>
undefendable from such attacks.
<br>
<p>As for the more serious attackers that really wish to
<br>
cause harm, the subway is far more vulnerable to firebombing than a
<br>
train, because the tunnel traps heat, the wreckage is inherently
<br>
difficult to remove, and in a subway tunnel it is far more difficult to
<br>
evacuate the survivors.
<br>
<p>There *may* be a way to make a subway train entirely
<br>
from nonflammables.  However, as time moves forward,
<br>
societies with incompatible premises are brought into
<br>
ever closer contact.  Luddites and extremists have ever
<br>
greater power to tear down society and disrupt progress.
<br>
That is why I made the prediction that within a decade,
<br>
the world's subway systems will be rendered useless.
<br>
<p>That being said, I suggest that such a fate is not the
<br>
end of progress as we know it, for the Silicon Valley
<br>
is a prime example of an extended suburb that supports
<br>
plenty of technological innovation with few mass transit systems or sky
<br>
scrapers.  A total disruption of BART, the local subway, would scarcely
<br>
be noticed, for its ridership has never been high.
<br>
<p>The obstructionists, terrorists, the McVeighs,
<br>
Bin Ladins, Kazinskys of this world have convinced
<br>
me humanity needs to spread out and cover all the available real estate,
<br>
to make society inherently less vulnerable and less dependent on those
<br>
systems which cannot in principle be defended.
<br>
<p>If global warming is true and we really can melt off
<br>
all that ice, we need to get on that, release that
<br>
carbon, free up all that land that is currently
<br>
unavailable.  All of northern Canada, Siberia, the
<br>
deserts, make it habitable, spread out, build enormous, extended
<br>
tenuously populated but inhabited civilization on all of it, with
<br>
thoroughly mixed cultures so that no one religion or custom can take
<br>
hold of the minds of the people there.  All governments would need to be
<br>
secular and open minded.
<br>
<p>Siberia is a perfect example.  Russia needs money.  We
<br>
should be able to buy huge tracts of that empty
<br>
real estate and make something out of it.  The Luddites
<br>
and terrorists have shown that humans must stop
<br>
bunching up, spread out and reclaim unused, wasted
<br>
land.  And water.
<br>
<p>All that from a Nova program pointing out how easy it
<br>
would be to shut down a subway system.  spike
