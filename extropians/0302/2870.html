A Soldier's Viewpoint on Surviving Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Attacks
<br>
From: SFC Red Thomas (Ret) Armor Master Gunner Mesa, AZ 
<br>
<p>Unlimited reproduction and distribution is authorized. Just give me credit for
<br>
my work, and, keep in context.
<br>

<br>
<p>Since the media has decided to scare everyone with predictions of chemical,
<br>
biological, or nuclear warfare on our turf I decided to write a paper and keep
<br>
things in their proper perspective. I am a retired military weapons, munitions,
<br>
and training expert. 
<br>
<p>Lesson number one: In the mid 1990s there were a series of nerve gas attacks on
<br>
crowded Japanese subway stations. Given perfect conditions for an attack less
<br>
than 10% of the people there were injured (the injured were better in a few
<br>
hours) and only one percent of the injured died. 
<br>
<p>60 Minutes once had a fellow telling us that one drop of nerve gas could kill a
<br>
thousand people, well he didn't tell you the thousand dead people per drop was
<br>
theoretical. 
<br>
<p>Drill Sergeants exaggerate how terrible this stuff was to keep the recruits
<br>
awake in class (I know this because I was a Drill Sergeant too). Forget
<br>
everything you've ever seen on TV, in the movies, or read in a novel about this
<br>
stuff, it was all a lie (read this sentence again out loud!). These weapons are
<br>
about terror, if you remain calm, you will probably not die. This is far less
<br>
scary than the media and their &quot;Experts,&quot; make it sound. 
<br>
<p>Chemical Weapons 
<br>
<p>Chemical weapons are categorized as nerve, blood, blister, and Incapacitating
<br>
agents. Contrary to the hype of reporters and politicians they are not weapons
<br>
of mass destruction they are &quot;area denial,&quot; and terror weapons that don't
<br>
destroy anything. When you leave the area you almost always leave the risk.
<br>
That's the difference; you can leave the area and the risk but soldiers may have
<br>
to stay put and sit through it and that's why they need all that spiffy gear.
