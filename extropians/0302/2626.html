<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Suppose I wonder whether there is such a
</em><br>
representation of my monitor---on which
<br>
I'm reading email---in my brain.  It turns
<br>
out that there is.  In our visual cortex
<br>
(I forget whether it's V4 or what), there
<br>
indeed is such a literal mapping&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Yes, you’ve got it!  There is an actual scale model in our head!
<br>
<p>And the monitor that you are consciously aware of, that you only think is the 
<br>
real thing in front of your real head is really simply this &quot;mapping&quot; in your 
<br>
brain.  Just as your conscious knowledge of your head in front of the monitor 
<br>
is also a similar &quot;mapping&quot; in your brain.  Everything you are consciously 
<br>
aware of is simply information in your brain that represents the reality beyond 
<br>
our senses – not reality itself.  Some of these representations are more 
<br>
accurate than others, and others, such as our knowledge of a soul or minds &quot;I&quot; 
<br>
inside the head looking out the eyes, have no referent in reality at all.  
<br>
(i.e. it can be considered an &quot;illusion&quot;)
<br>
<p>The important thing is these conscious representations are more real than 
<br>
reality itself.  We know such exists more than we know reality itself exists.  
<br>
They are made of qualia or the phenomenal properties of something in our brain –
<br>
&nbsp;something traditional cause and effect science alone is unable to observe.  In 
<br>
order to discover and observe what/how these phenomenal qualities are requires 
<br>
effing. (see my paper at <a href="http://home.attbi.com/~brent.allsop">http://home.attbi.com/~brent.allsop</a>)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Monkeys eyes were held fixed while they
</em><br>
steadily looked at a certain geometric
<br>
figure (a grid or a triangle, I forget).
<br>
Then they were instantly killed, and it
<br>
was found that this same grid was
<br>
present, and spatially too, in their
<br>
visual cortex (at the back of their heads).
<br>
So it seems that we do have a picture in
<br>
our heads for visual information.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>This is new to me and frankly hard to believe.  The representations survive 
<br>
past death??  Do you have some references or something?
