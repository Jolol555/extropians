<em>&gt;I do not understand this statement. Why do you participate in a discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forum if you are not willing, or capable, to defend your positions to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with whom you have discussion? There is nothing wrong with having &quot;a peace
</em><br>
<em>&gt;loving&quot; attitude, my experience on this site leads me to believe it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something shared by everyone on this forum.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Are you sure? I suggest you think more about this last sentence. I don't
<br>
bother discussing at any depth my political philosophy or my
<br>
criticism of the U.S. government here any more, even though I agree with
<br>
most of Hubert's and Kai's and Dan's and Anders' and Damien's
<br>
(etc.) words, because I attracted a cluster of aggressive posters who
<br>
stereotyped and misinterpretted what I wrote, and it was tiring and
<br>
unpleasant to have to defend even the smallest and simplest of statements. &quot;
<br>
<p>Amara, I don't think that necessarily implies that the people who responded
<br>
to you are not 'peace loving' though they could serve to be a little more
<br>
calm, polite, and rational (as could I).  But I do still believe they could
<br>
be considered prefferring peace over non-peace.  I am fortunate enough in my
<br>
current daily employ that I have the time to read just about every message
<br>
that comes through on this list, and from my perception it did seem that you
<br>
received more than your fair share of 'nit picking' whenever you expressed
<br>
an opinion.  I am not sure why that is, though I think many of these
<br>
problems come from this medium as a form of communication.  Its very one
<br>
dimensional compared to our normal routes of communication and as such is
<br>
often open to misinterpretations, incorrect inferences, and just plain lack
<br>
of clarity.  We have no visual clues, no tones to pick up on, etc.  Also, it
<br>
is essentially anonymous.  I often find that respondents (including myself,
<br>
im sure) respond to what an author literally wrote instead of what the
<br>
author intended, an intention that would have probably become clear to the
<br>
responder if they took a moment to sit back and think about what the author
<br>
said.  Personally I experienced this much during my conversations on the
<br>
continuation of conscioussness through destructive copying mechanisms,
<br>
finding myself in a minority opinion with many people nit picking (it seemed
<br>
to me) every single sentence instead of responding to the concept I was
<br>
trying to relay.  Combining the difficulties of this form of communication,
<br>
the likely inability for me to obey my ideas clearly, and the tendancy for
<br>
responders to 'jump the gun' occasionally, it could seem that many people on
<br>
this list are brash, overbearing, or a little too confronontational.  
<br>
<p>That being said, I would be considered by many to be a 'hawk' and at
<br>
humania's implication not 'peace loving', furthermore, humania implied that
<br>
the loss of Eugen Lietl to this list was the fault of us hawks and we should
<br>
be ashamed of running him off.  But I refuse to be held accountable to
<br>
anyone's actions but my own, it is no fault of mine that Eugen felt it
<br>
prudent to leave this list.  I am saddened by the departure, and hope it is
<br>
only temporary, but the implication that I should stifle my opinions for
<br>
fear of offending or driving off others who are more valuable than I is
<br>
insulting.  If certain opinions are politically incorrect to present, than
<br>
extropy should make that clear.  And actually, they did...
<br>
<p>A few weeks back, Extropy Vice Prex Greg Burch specifically posted on the
<br>
IRAQ discussions on this list
<br>
<p>&quot;First, I've asked myself the question of whether the subject of the Iraq
<br>
war has a sufficiently transhumanist or extropian component to warrant such
<br>
a huge portion of the bandwidth here.  In many ways, the subject is skew to
<br>
extropians interests, since the potential combatants on both sides have so
<br>
little sympathy for extropian ideas and ideals.  But, ultimately I suppose
<br>
there is sufficient relevance to the reason for this List's existence to
<br>
tolerate such a large volume of discussion: To name just three, questions of
<br>
war and peace on such a scale can effect that march of progress toward a
<br>
transhuman world, the evolution of methods of warfare will be relevant to
<br>
our interests, and the geopolitical alignment of the large interest groups
<br>
in the world over the next few decades will certainly have an impact on our
<br>
goals. &quot;
<br>
<p>That disagreement here between 'hawks' and 'doves' essentially comes down to
<br>
a disagreement on which actions are most extropic, are most beneficial to
<br>
all of humanity and bringing about the singularity.  Both sides say thiers
<br>
is, while calling the other side 'non-extropic' yet the 'dove' camp insists
<br>
that the hawks are nothing less than 'horny war mongerers' (to use humania's
<br>
phrase)  Does humania truly think I am 'horny for war'?  Or is it possible
<br>
that with our (the 'hawks') range of knowledge and experience we truly
<br>
believe that in this event a pacifist diplomatic solution will result in a
<br>
world less extropic and less friendly to the progress of humanity?  
<br>
<p>Lee corbin posted a clear list of reasons why an extropian or person
<br>
generally concerned with the well being of humanity might support such
<br>
actions and why they might be considered extropic (and transhuman)
<br>
<p>(1) non-proliferation of WMD
<br>
(2) diminishing support for terrorists
<br>
(3) breaking monopolistic control of oil
<br>
(4) punishing the abrogation of treaties and agreements
<br>
(5) giving the evil and murderous Iraqi regime what it richly deserves
<br>
(6) instilling fear in small dictatorships in general, and also respect for
<br>
the West's values on human rights
<br>
<p>Damien recently posted (hopefully I am not misinterpreting his comments
<br>
here)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time goes on, the fewer reasons I can think of for not nailing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Bollocks.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Me too, iff it can be done without terrible aggravated entropic
<br>
consequences. (Lord Dehede has a conniption and falls in astonishment from
<br>
his chair. :)...Iff&quot;
<br>
<p>These are essentially the justifications that the 'hawks' have, contrary to
<br>
being 'horny for war' we (at least I) believe based on my accumulated
<br>
knowledge that this will have a net positive result, that we will remove a
<br>
murderous tyrant from pow.... Bla bla bla, its all been said before, you
<br>
know the drill.
<br>
<p>The same kind of conversations and emotions flared just post 9/11 and also
<br>
going into the Afghan conflict, they subsided, a normal much more 'extropic'
<br>
topics were again popular and dominated the threads.   
<br>
<p>I personally think it unreasonable to consider the question of going to war
<br>
with IRAQ as NOT having extropic consequences, and thus it would be natural
<br>
to discuss on an extropian list.  
<br>
<p>Bringing about a better world for all humans is not only going to happen
<br>
through science and technology, but will necessarily require changes in
<br>
politics, economics, and the humanities, and as such a concentrated effort
<br>
to bring about that better world will necessarily require discussions of
<br>
those topics.  
<br>
<p>Regards to those whom do not all ready have me in their kill file as a
<br>
'hawk' or 'aggressive poster',
<br>
