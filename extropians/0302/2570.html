This review appeared recently in a specialist insiderly sf zine, THE NEW
<br>
YORK REVIEW OF SCIENCE FICTION, and I'm mimicking Clute's own manner (the
<br>
second section flagrantly appropriates and reapplies reflexively a passage
<br>
from one of his own reviews), so don't get too annoyed if it seems
<br>
perversely obscure. Think of it as a movie: Being John Clute.
<br>
<p>=======================
<br>
<p>Appleseed, by John Clute
<br>
New York: Tor, January 2002; $25.95 hc; 337 pages
<br>
reviewed by Damien Broderick
<br>
<p><p><p>Once I dedicated a book of theory thus: For John Clute, the world's finest
<br>
science fiction critic. Yeah, but what's he done for us lately? An sf novel,
<br>
that's what he's done. Not many notable sf critics have dared that, not
<br>
unless they started out as fiction writers like Aldiss, Benford, Blish,
<br>
Budrys, Delany, Jones, Knight, Le Guin, Lem, Russ, a handful more. George
<br>
Turner's the only one who comes immediately to mind. He'd have detested
<br>
Appleseed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1: A Modest Proposal in a Time of Singularity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science aspires to the condition of deicide.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology aspires to the condition of theogenesis.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science fiction aspires to the condition of theophany.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2: Why, This is the Megatext, nor am I out of It!
<br>
<p>Like any really good  sf novel written by an intelligent author at the peak
<br>
of his craft, Appleseed is a byte dance and sorting of all the sf protocols
<br>
we are likely to call up from memory. In an afterword, Clute acknowledges
<br>
various predecessors on whom he has done, in echo of his deicidal,
<br>
theogenic, theophanous book, Oedipal riffsCJohn Crowley, Thomas M. Disch, L.
<br>
Frank Baum, Jorge Luis Borges, Rudyard Kipling, Arthur C. Clarke, Gene
<br>
Wolfe, Roger ZelaznyCand he could have mentioned quite a few more, Samuel R.
<br>
Delany and Dan Simmons, to name two, but perhaps there is no real need to be
<br>
explicit, for the book is radiant with the language and moves of the
<br>
genre-edge and all the way back to the deep center; and the thrill of the
<br>
thing lies in the sense of new things transfiguring the old.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a tale fetched up from the Ocean of Story; arguably, it is the story
<br>
of the Ocean of Story, which is us, is all.
<br>
<p>3. Of the Origin of Narrative Species
<br>
<p>Storytellers once spun out their inventions by the hour with rhythm, bold
<br>
colors, engaging or horrid characters: simple tricks. Then they took up
<br>
pens. After fiction and journalism parted company, manner swiftly put out a
<br>
thousand blooms. Matter grew baroque. On the tables of the languid, grand
<br>
operatic works groaned unread.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future shock put a brutal stop to that. Bullrings and blood and short hard
<br>
words.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kids of those kids went to school and studied fine art, high culture,
<br>
and the sentences went lacy again, and irony caught every word in a trap.
<br>
Who knew how to read?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of those without reading accreditation did it anyway, with factory
<br>
fairytales. They built bigger muscles in fourteen days or had their money
<br>
back. Sf was anti-mandarin. Punched like a rivet. It was, as well, magic out
<br>
of a whirling adolescent heart: it sang incantatory romance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally the thing went decadent with over-use. Sf risked expiring in this
<br>
terminal generation of embroidery on ideas which once... blazed. Still,
<br>
opportunities arise in a decadent art-form. As in a retirement village or a
<br>
jail, everyone knows the narrative shorthand. You can write whole novels in
<br>
the number of words it once took to get the spaceship out of the lab.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, it seems, it changed again, somewhat. Exfoliation happened. In the
<br>
first 63 pages of Appleseed what happens is that the chicken crosses the
<br>
road, ornately, or rather gets part of the way to the other side, then goes
<br>
back. That's all, really. What happens in the second chapter shows that this
<br>
estimate was too hopeful. In fact, the chicken does not get back from
<br>
attempting the curb until page 84, the end of the chapter, a quarter of the
<br>
way in. Later we learn that we have misunderstood the chicken, have
<br>
seriously undervalued and misidentified this baffled but plucky fowl. In
<br>
fact, the chicken (Nathaniel Freer, than whom nobody is, or is less than: O
<br>
paradox!) and his wife (named Ferocity Monthly-Niece, whom hereafter we
<br>
might be tempted to call PMT for short) will be the masters of the sevagram.
<br>
I bet you expected that.
<br>
<p>4: Clute For Dummies
<br>
<p>It's an involuted ocean, this Ocean of Story. The inside, as so often in
<br>
canonical sf, is larger than the outside. Wormholes eat at the core of the
<br>
apple, which is the world, which is Trantor, which is the Yggdrasil, which
<br>
is the Omphalos of the Pleroma, and so on, yet they don=t so much eat it as
<br>
constitute it, spiraling inward and outward like choirs of angels. Certainly
<br>
we can add Dante to that list above, and perhaps Geoff Ryman. Perhaps you
<br>
think I'm being irritatingly obscure or roundabout, but reading Clute does
<br>
that to you. Be prepared to work like buggery at this novel. Persist,
<br>
reader, there is treasure to be had.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I could tell you the plot, but then half the fun is gone, because
<br>
really there is no plot, just a revelation space in the core of the tumble
<br>
and burnished, blazing array of verbal icons telling a story of God as
<br>
shit-eater and the necessary revolt against themself. Killing God is not
<br>
very shocking these days, it being the escape artistry theme of the century
<br>
we've left behind, not when Philip Pullman can place it at the hinge of his
<br>
rather good children's trilogy (something earnest librarians urging kiddies
<br>
to try His Dark Materials have not noticed, apparently--but wait for the
<br>
plaque to hit the wall when they do). Appleseed is a puzzle palace, a memory
<br>
palace, a cryptic crossword, a map of the world carved up into small absurd
<br>
pieces and scattered, so that its gestalt recovery in the mind's eye urges
<br>
theophany, or its simulation. You don't get that from looking up the answers
<br>
in the back of the book, not even if the book's The Dark Night of the Soul
<br>
or Morte D'Arthur. That was a hint: it really the Matter of Britain on a
<br>
cosmic as well as the classic Glastonbury cosmogonic scale. Maybe that's not
<br>
surprising from a Canadian who has lived much of his adult and intensely
<br>
book-drenched life in England.
<br>
<p>5: Matière de Bretagne on Mars
<br>
<p>`Stinky' Freer is hired, or so he supposes, to convey in his starship Tile
<br>
DanceCwhich is laminated with Janus-faced tiles, congealed mindsCa cargo of
<br>
nanoforges from the planet Trencher, where he is nearly eaten, to the
<br>
unknown planet Eolhxir, but he doesn't need to know where it is because his
<br>
pilot is a parthenogenic tree named Mamselle Cunning Earth Link (and I don't
<br>
think it's a pun on cunnilingus, but what else can it be?) which proves
<br>
pregnant with the once and future king who is named, I kid you not, as such:
<br>
Arturus Quondam Captain Future. You might find this almost unbearably
<br>
whimsical and recursively knowing, but then Quondam's Mom apparently learned
<br>
her English from Alfred Bester's fabulous temporal beachcomber, tall, gaunt,
<br>
sprightly, bitter Mr. Aquila (from `5,271,009', half a century ago):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shivering with anxious joy, behold me, sure! O enormous masculine sophont
<br>
of dead Earth,' she continued, `bucking the bronco sigillum into badlandsÿ
<br>
Agog with flush was I, you can altogether bet! Seeing you in the skin that
<br>
wears those mighty bones! That was scrumptious! That was lagniappe! But reck
<br>
you, O striking figure of a man, that such solace of the senses was my
<br>
purpose down below? Nix!'
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's charming, that's lagniappe, and it goes on for pages, wonderfully
<br>
sustained, you can get hungry for its return in these densely wrought pages;
<br>
there were stretches, elsewhere, I could hardly bear to get through more
<br>
than a page and a half at a time. Freer buys and wakens an ancient AI battle
<br>
bot called Uncle Sam (later revealed to be SammSabaoth, which for all I know
<br>
is significantly Kabbalistic):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Uncle? said Freer into Teardrop.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archaic eyes of the truculent Uncle Sam glared at him, rimmed by
<br>
flaming grooves, which shifted and flowed and became the image of an open
<br>
fist, a fist appaumy, an heraldic warrior fist apparently aflame. The face
<br>
of the Uncle Sam was at one and the same time a face and a hand, a hand
<br>
which was a weapon, a weapon which raised a palm of peace, but a palm
<br>
clenched. (p. 26)
<br>
<p>And on and on. `Appaumy', I learn from the web (it's not in my fat
<br>
dictionary) is heraldic jargon for palm outward. The citation below is
<br>
niftier, but there's page after tens of pages of this Forbidden
<br>
Planet/Delanyesque/Gibsonish stuff as Freer gets from his spaceship (in
<br>
orbit?) down to (?) the planet Trencher (`Bite me!' as it were), like the
<br>
chicken and road joke indefinitely extended:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The braid did a loop-the-loop, gathering stray capillaries in like
<br>
knitting, and exited docking country, passing through walls of rock and into
<br>
a central intersection, seemingly roofed with glass, where bilateral and
<br>
non-bilateral networks linked briefly, where Trencher opened downwards and
<br>
up like the veined inner atrium of a dream of cities; vast artificial suns
<br>
and moons and discs flickered through luminescent cupolas miles above
<br>
Freer's head downwards through vertical arcades lined with mirrors. The
<br>
float skidded through terrifyingly open air, freefell down a spidery frond
<br>
curling for hundreds of yards over an abyss that dived downwards to magma.
<br>
They hurtled into darkness shot by fireflies which turned out to be argosies
<br>
ferrying homo sapiens upwards, perhaps heading towards an ark and the
<br>
deepest of senior-citizen sleeps. There were a dozen of them; more. The
<br>
inside of the world was churning.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Is this normal?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Aye aye, said the Uncle Sam.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They continued down, through a great shaft of light, dazzled, sigillated
<br>
by photonic data flows cascading downwards from far above, perhaps
<br>
ultimately from orbit, where the great Care Consortia arks shot perpetually
<br>
their perfume and their honeytrap slogans into the apertures of the planet.
<br>
Most of the data streams displayed the Insort Geront logo, the fiery
<br>
three-snake caduceus almost too bright to read, the marque of the vastest of
<br>
the godzillas--a ancient Human Earth term for any corporation, whether snail
<br>
or trad dotcom or seeded nous cube, which having gone rogue was no longer
<br>
subject to the rule of law of any individual state or planet or
<br>
system--prating `Enkyklios Paedia' incessantly, boring its mantra deep into
<br>
the bone of the planet. (pp. 31-2)
<br>
<p>And boring not just its mantra, I fear. This is overload in the service of
<br>
bedazzlement, but it keeps going wrong: godzilla is parochial enough, but
<br>
dotcom was dead before the book came out, and I doubt they'd have knitting
<br>
in this remote future. There's an explanation for the explanation, of sorts:
<br>
Freer's viewpoint is geared to ours, since our time is his selected `era of
<br>
empathy choice on Human Earth', the ancestral world of pheromone stenchy,
<br>
sex-obsessed bipedals now swallowed up, one gathers, like much of the
<br>
universe, by encrustations of  plaque, corrupted legacy data shit:
<br>
Malacandra, as C. S. Lewis told us long ago it was, and is.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All space opera aspires to the condition of Quest. Appleseed has more
<br>
grails than you can shake a lance at. Johnny Appleseed, a scabrous rogue,
<br>
wears one upside down upon his hairy head, like a tin pot, as in Vachel
<br>
Lindsay's folkloric poem (`The apple allied to the thorn/Child of the rose)
<br>
which is quoted in extenso in several places. He scatters his seed, we might
<br>
suppose, across the galaxy. All Quest aspires to the condition of Tantra,
<br>
delayed gratification to the max, unendurable pleasure indefinitely
<br>
sustained. Still, novels have climaxes, and Clute does not blink: as in
<br>
several Norman Spinrad space operas where captains literally fuck their way
<br>
through hyperspace, Freer and Ferocity screw the world back into place,
<br>
screw the inscrutable, as their ancient Predecessor starship, secret hero of
<br>
the tale, fucks the world back to heaven. Sort of thing.
<br>
<p>6. Holiest Communion
<br>
<p>Appleseed is a consummately Catholic novel. It's a God-eat-dog world, and
<br>
vice versa. In the hollowed fecundities of its grails lie lenses, hosts
<br>
which focus Eucharistic haecceity. They are, finally, eaten; almost
<br>
everything is. A malign triune godthing named Opsophagous of the Harpe (a
<br>
harpe is a scythe)--sons born endlessly in the dying belly of fathers, which
<br>
they munch--deliriously and continuously eats its own flesh in a Clutean
<br>
rapture of disgust. Luckily for the galaxy, it's a dog-fuck-dog world too.
<br>
Humans are, famously, on heat all round the clock. They can do it face to
<br>
face, looking scandalously into each others' eyes, but in this unbuckled
<br>
honest Darwinian future, 5000 years hence, reeking and leaking with sex day
<br>
and night, they start it doggie fashion, sniffing and licking and mounting
<br>
to heaven:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her body glowed with sweat...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shall we fuck slow?'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No,' said Ferocity. `No, I don't think I can.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaped toward him.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shifted sideways, slipped his hand between her legs, and they fell
<br>
through the light gravity on to the floating bed, hardly noticing as it rose
<br>
into the cupola, where windows real and universal gave them to the world.
<br>
They burrowed into position, as was the normal habit of homo sapiens
<br>
anywhere after the loss of Human Earth, lowering their heads to each other's
<br>
orifices, sniffing, touching tongues to the pomace of sweat and juices. It
<br>
was as though they were checking passports.
<br>
<p>Those windows are for seeing through. The Predecessors, we learn, `were
<br>
epithalamialÿ Anything an excuse for a marriage', and everyone loves to
<br>
watch. It's a robustly binary universe, which aspires to the condition of
<br>
unitarity (down there in the quantum foam, here in the human heart, the
<br>
wedding of Möbius), of dialectical sublation, and gets it, for a while. This
<br>
is not surprising to devotees of Clute's emergent theoretics. He has been
<br>
telling us for some years that the secret heart and driver of sf's mode is
<br>
exogamy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Tell me a story
<br>
<p>All art, all science, aspires to the condition of story. In the Ocean of
<br>
Story, which is the world, liturgy tells the world into being and sustains
<br>
it. In the liturgy of science fiction, new thing upon the face of history,
<br>
liturgy not only repeats, it insists upon the novum. In Appleseed, here is
<br>
the mantra refrain, universally acknowledged, before which all fall silent
<br>
and listen, or tell:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sacred is the new. Tell me a story.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Appleseed's world, the world is written on the face of words, but also
<br>
tucked away inside, doubled, mirrored, counter-braced, upended. Freer, we
<br>
learn, wears the face of Jim Thorne, Indian, finest American athlete of the
<br>
first half of the last century. (So? The thorn and the rose? The Glastonbury
<br>
thorn? On and on it goes.) On Trencher, Freer's ancient starship  buys him
<br>
those two Made Minds, bound to service, warbot Uncle Sam (or SammSabaoth)
<br>
and absolute navigator Vipassana, which Clute does not tell us is the
<br>
Buddhist term for clear insight, the Art of Mindfulness; this is a book of
<br>
ironies. Stinky's angel at the helm of Tile Dance or more truly Ynis Gutrin
<br>
(which is Glastonbury, cathedral of the Grail) is she/he quantum KathKirtt,
<br>
wedded Kirttimukha and his bride. Now Kirttimukha, as everyone surely knows
<br>
and so Clute need not tell us, and does not, is the horned, leonine `face of
<br>
glory' from Indian myth, but what of Kath? Here's my guess: she's Kathapitha
<br>
or Katha Sarit Sagara, from the same Sanskrit writings: Ocean of, of course,
<br>
Story.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sundered Möbius world they knit up and make new, reprieving its Waste
<br>
Land wound, is Klavier, reality's birth canal, perhaps, the cosmic bicameral
<br>
brain, all that, and in Klavier, of course, the condition of all things
<br>
aspires to the condition of music, Beethovian thunder, glory, molten light.
<br>
Appleseed is the fall of seed into fertile soil, kenosis, Clute tells us:
<br>
incarnation of `the divine into the progeria of mortal flesh'. That, at
<br>
least, is the opinion of `the theophrasts of the inner stars', but the novel
<br>
insists that the theophrasts are wrong. For all that, the machine angels of
<br>
the world `found it strangely thrilling to spreadeagle themselves on the
<br>
rack of time: to gape through the peepshow eyes of their chosen faces at the
<br>
meat faces of the mortals to whom they gave suck.' These faces are dual:
<br>
flyte and jack, out and in, maybe, or in and out. Don't ask me, you'll find
<br>
out, or won't. The narrative blows in the winds, the gales of time. It winds
<br>
in gyres. It closes in theophany and deicide, as space opera ought.
