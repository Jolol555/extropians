<p>I don't think that I agree with you. I do agree that there is no single
<br>
physical thing which is the self, but something is there; an epiphenomenon
<br>
most likely, but that can still be real. I think it's reasonable to be very
<br>
loose with a definition of self, as I think it is
<br>
personal/subjective/individual, a result of recursive mental processes. This
<br>
doesn't make it wrong.
<br>
<p>I wonder that, given your opinion on the self (which is a position worthy of
<br>
respect, I believe), you sign your post with a name. What does it signify?
