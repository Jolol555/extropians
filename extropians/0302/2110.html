<em>&gt;&gt;Temperature increases from global warming could cause millions of
</em><br>
deaths in developing nations that are very dependant on existing
<br>
climates.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Global warming until proven is just a theory.  We haven't been keeping
<br>
weather records long enough to know if the short trend of warmer weather
<br>
we are seeing is statistically significant much less caused by our
<br>
emissions.
<br>
<p>Geologists have shown by studying layers of the earths's crust that
<br>
there have been numerous shifts in the planets climate.
<br>
<p>Even if we are accelerating the warming effect, it will still happen
<br>
over a long long period of time allowing us to perfect alternate energy
<br>
sources as fossil fuels become scarcer and more expensive!
<br>
<p>What about the the cold and temperate zones on the planet.  Global
<br>
warming could yield milder winters and greatly lessen the energy needed
<br>
for heat.  People in Ohio where I live would appreciate shorter and
<br>
milder winters.
<br>
<p>Perhaps some areas will be intolerably hot but areas like the continent
<br>
under the arctic may become habitable!  As temperatures slowly increase
<br>
people will migrate to more desirable climates.  As Sam Kinison used to
<br>
be fond of saying, Don't give people in the desert food, get them the
<br>
F#@% out of the desert!
<br>
<p>I'm sorry but with all the worlds other immediate problems, I've never
<br>
been able to get too worked up over global warming!  I'm sure some of
<br>
you out there can tell me why I should be though!
