We're one short debate and vote away from a major hit to life extension
<br>
medicine:

<p>This sort of stuff really makes me mad. I mean, government agents really
<br>
don't have to *prove* that they can kill a whole bunch of people through the
<br>
machinations of a State and human nature. Theraputic cloning is currently
<br>
criminalized in France, and well on the way to being criminalized in the US.
<br>
<p>Last paragraph of this pretty much says it all:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.reason.com/rb/rb022603.shtml">http://www.reason.com/rb/rb022603.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Future generations will look back at the beginning of the 21st century with
<br>
astonishment that some very well meaning and intelligent people actually
<br>
wanted to stop biomedical research just to protect their cramped and limited
<br>
vision of human nature. They will look back, I predict, and thank us for
<br>
making their world of longer, healthier lives possible.&quot;
<br>
<p>It's lunacy. Self-destructive, murderous lunacy, egged on by the likes of
<br>
deathists such as Kass and Fukuyama. (They're more than deathists -- they
<br>
advocate that everyone be forced to suffer and become crippled too). If
<br>
unchecked this is lunacy that will kill most of us. Once legislation like
<br>
this passes, it can be decades before it's repealed.
<br>
<p>Gloomy, angry, fist-thumping-desk sort of day.
