</em><br>
<em>&gt; political expression on the Extropy list, you are complaining that when you

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>I don't have the slightest problem with people disagreeing with me. That 
<br>
gives the best arguments.
<br>
<p>But the problem is that americans and europeans discuss things differently.
<br>
<p>I wrote a lengthy post about this a few years back, but I cannot find it 
<br>
in the archives.
<br>
<p>But generally the difference is that the US' joins a discussion to win 
<br>
the argument through the presentation of facts, and the EU's wants to 
<br>
gain understanding by seing all sides of the argument.
<br>
<p>This makes the EU's seem to be whimpy and end leftist to the US', and 
<br>
the US' seem to be dogmatic and ignorant to the EU's.
<br>
<p>It comes from the differences in educational culture. And makes 
<br>
discussing subjects extremely difficult. Also it makes the differences 
<br>
seem larger than they really are.
<br>
<p>I really don't know what there is to do about it.
<br>
<p><p><p>But what I really don't understand is that there is a relatively large 
<br>
group here that practically *only* discuss politics. I frankly cannot 
<br>
see why they should choose to do it here. There must be more 
<br>
interresting venues for that.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the extropians list is really two lists. One where 
<br>
politics are discussed, and one where extropian ideas are discussed. And 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rarely does the two groups overlap.
