<em>&gt; Taxing the hell out of oil and spending 99% of those taxes on welfare

</em><br>
<p>Government spending is a (very big) issue that is separate from the issue of 
<br>
how best to raise the money to run government. Would you be better or worse 
<br>
off if your oil heating bill increased by $200 next winter AND you also got 
<br>
an additional $200 in your tax rebate check? That is the question I am asking.
<br>
<p>By the by, I've known some dang good workers who relied on welfare to get 
<br>
back on their feet from knocks beyond their control. If done wisely (and I 
<br>
acknowledge that often it is not) I think welfare can be an excellent 
<br>
investment in the future of the nation.
