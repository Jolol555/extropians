<p>
Opinions expressed are from a poster on the TLCB (see below) list:
<br>
<p>Terry
<br>
<p><p>This guy and another of the shields appeared on MS NBC tonight atop the shelter
<br>
in Bhagdad that the US killed 409 innocent civilians in &quot;WITH AMERICAN SCUDS&quot;. 
<br>
The newsguy actually cut him off, he was so off base in his script. Must have
<br>
been the long trip. 
<br>
<p>They were extrememly bitter in everything they said, and inaccurate also. 
<br>
(America has no Scuds) I think they missed the Monument to the gas victums
<br>
(10,000), the extinct Swamp Arabs (80,000), the Kurdish massacre sites (30,000),
<br>
or the  summarily executed Kuwaitis (7000).  Over 200,000 Iraqi dead are
<br>
attributed to Hussein.   Don't go east though.  Iran shared a little Saddam
<br>
history too (over 1,000,000 dead).  No doubt they will stand guard over the Baby
<br>
Milk Factory. 
<br>
<p>OOPs I forgot something.  500,000 Iraqi dead children.  More or less.   Well
<br>
guess what, the life expectancy of the Iraqi born today is now higher (some
<br>
sanctions!) than it was BEFORE the Gulf War, which was higher than it was BEFORE
<br>
the Iran War.  It seems that the life expectancy goes down when Iraq is at war
<br>
or shortly thereafter and then bounces right up.  Hmmmmm? 
<br>
<p>Well, Iraqi conscrpits are expendable, and post war massacres in both the upper
<br>
and lower Iraq created a need for a NO FLY ZONE to prevent further bloodshed. 
<br>
Now it is on the rise again.  My guess is that the blame for all of the dead
<br>
Iraqi offspring will be laid on George Bush even though the last President had
<br>
office for 90% of the time involved.  Seems fair to the Green Party.
