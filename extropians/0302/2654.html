Avatar Polymorph writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin notes I diverge from the &quot;I&quot; discussion to uploading.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True... still, consciousness and uploading are interlinked discussions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both interlink with the idea of consent.
</em><br>
<p>Yes; I was just noting it; no criticism meant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe that Tipler in the particular scenario of the Omega Point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory of his book envisages us upgrading ourselves (or perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading) into energy states (as all the matter in the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmogrified cosmologically in any case) and these are integrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the universal (truly) Turing machine/computer matrix,
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's one way to describe.  But to those of us who
<br>
consider all Turing machine equivalents to equally instantiate
<br>
an uploaded person, the exact means is not important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which then one presumes uses the photon signatures etc. to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reconstruct the bodies of the earlier dead just as they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about to die (prior to brain death)
</em><br>
<p>This is only how the data is collected.  And as for
<br>
&quot;reconstructing the bodies&quot;, why, no---not at all.
<br>
When you upload you no longer require a physical
<br>
body.  It's as I said before:  for all I know, my
<br>
brain could be in a jar in Moscow.
<br>
<p>From your remarks I wonder if I read &quot;The Physics of
<br>
Immortality&quot; too rapidly, or you didn't get what
<br>
Tipler was driving at.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in virtualities which are made to allow for such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (correct particle configurations, etc.) and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presumably these beings get to go through their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; options.
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea why you keep mixing the possible moral
<br>
questions with the descriptions of what *could* happen.
<br>
What is wrong with the simple picture here:
<br>
<p>Whether it's (a) I get resuscitated after a cryonic
<br>
sleep (b) I get uploaded by an SAI  (c) I get uploaded
<br>
at the Omega point, in one sense it's all the same to
<br>
me subjectively.  I don't die.  It's as simple as that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But this process which occurs through quantum splitting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not strictly speaking uploading but splitting.
</em><br>
<p>What the devil do you mean by this?  You are using the
<br>
terminology usually associated with MWI or quantum
<br>
mechanics.  If you mean having a duplicate created,
<br>
with the original preserved, you can always use Eugen
<br>
Leitl's term &quot;forking&quot;.  I guess that that's what you
<br>
mean.
<br>
<p>And, as you know, if I'm suddenly forked and a new
<br>
Lee suddenly comes to in Mongolia, that has nothing
<br>
to do with the one here, who won't be aware that it
<br>
happened at all.  Vice-versa, the one in Mongolia
<br>
will only wonder how he got suddenly teleported
<br>
there, and will be unaware that the original still
<br>
exists in California.  It's a very clear picture
<br>
from over here, Avatar.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There will have to be some mechanism for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega Point matrix to reconfigure the dying person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (split B) to stop the process of death
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  And if I'm dying of cancer there has
<br>
to be, duh, some treatment for Alcor to use to
<br>
save me from it, or they revived me too soon.
<br>
What could be more natural?  If one is resurrected
<br>
at the Omega Point, very simply one's disease will
<br>
not be loaded into the virtual reality one experiences.
<br>
I hope that this is clear.  If not, here is an example.
<br>
A person X has just died in a fiery automobile crash.
<br>
At the Omega Point, the state of his experiences just
<br>
as the fireball was killing him is re-created.
<br>
<p>&quot;Ouch!&quot;, he says.  &quot;What was that?&quot;  THE VOICE: &quot;You
<br>
died back in 2003 in an auto crash, remember?&quot;  The
<br>
resurrectee:  &quot;Yes, that's the last thing I remember.
<br>
What year is it now?&quot;, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (or alternatively to then upload the dying person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a body which has no injuries or is a substratum of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computronium).
</em><br>
<p>No one will need bodies by the time I'm either defrosted
<br>
or uploaded by the Omega Point!  And if uploading through
<br>
nanotech becomes available in 2017, I'll *both* upload
<br>
and remain in this body.  Why not?  I'd rather be alive
<br>
in two places than one anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, Tipler may be wrong about the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedure.  What is exciting about Tipler for me is:
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; . quantum splitting
</em><br>
<p>Now I am less sure that you meant before &quot;creating a 
<br>
duplicate&quot;.  Now I worry that this is about QM.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; . the demonstration that nanotech probes can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   reach all or most of the full universe
</em><br>
<p>Well, Tipler predicates his whole theory on the universe
<br>
curling up just so, so that this is necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; . articulation of the principle of transference
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   of the apparently dead
</em><br>
<p>Google for &quot;cryonics&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; . articulation of the principle of seeking full
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   extropy (infinite growth) [as you know, some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   writers speculate even heat death can be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   for this purpose]..
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee wants to know why I'm an augmenter rather than uploader.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I reject uploading because of the principle of continuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being breached [and the duplicate is only a rough approximation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not quantum and therefore according to Tipler a &quot;split&quot;].
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  And you are only a *much more rough* approximation
<br>
of the Avatar who wrote the post I'm responding to.  Did
<br>
he survive?  Well, if you've been around, you know that
<br>
we've been through the identity stuff a lot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I want to know why you do not consider your present atomic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; configuration to be a near-duplicate of your state yesterday.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; As I hold time travel to be unethical, without gaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the consent of every person affected, the question does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not arise for me.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, sorry for not clarifying.  This has NOTHING to do with
<br>
time travel.  The argument, again, is that you are concerned
<br>
that a non-exact duplicate of you is not you.  My counter is,
<br>
you are a non-exact duplicate of the person you were yesterday.
<br>
Yet he survives, because you and he are the same person.  It
<br>
was only that old point that I was making.  Time travel and
<br>
ethics have absolutely NOTHING to do with it.
<br>
