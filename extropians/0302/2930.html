<em>&gt;Emlyn intoned:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;&lt;People from Iceland raided England &amp; Ireland a lot! Rape, pillage,
</em><br>
burning
<br>
<em>&gt;stuff. Or was that Greenland? Hmm, a dodgy country if ever I saw one. Has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone considered if they might require a pre-emptive strike, too?&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Now the old clock on the wall indicates that this was some 12 centuries
</em><br>
ago! I seem to remember that Saddam 
<br>
<em>&gt; and his cohorts in Al Qeida are operating on a much faster clock then the
</em><br>
Saxon British. A much more recent
<br>
<em>&gt; vintage, yes?
</em><br>
<p>Sadaam and his cohorts in Al Qaeda? What a curious statement. As far as I am
<br>
aware, they are enemies.
<br>

<p><p><em>&gt;&lt;&lt;I can't find any instances of that, but Iceland is very angry about the
</em><br>
US's
<br>
<em>&gt;anti-whaling stance. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/16048/story.htm">http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/16048/story.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They are evil whale killers! They probably use chemical weapons on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actual whales! Show me proof that they don't.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Yah, the whales ain't thrilled with it either, however, those Icelanders
</em><br>
have yet to murder an American in NYC,
<br>
<em>&gt;or a Australian clubbing in Bali, yet have they?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know of anyone except Al Qaeda members/supporters who have been
<br>
involved in these events. Yet apparently those events are not part of the
<br>
criteria for determining war targets, if current policy is to be believed.
<br>
So Iceland is still in the firing line, imho.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&lt;&lt;This one is out of left field. In any case, how do you know that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;haven't tried and failed? Or succeeded, in fact? GWB might be an Icelandik
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mole (hard gig, digging in that frozen ground).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Emlyn &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>btw, what was that crack about assassinating the president all about?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Proving once again, that mothers should never let their babies grow up with
</em><br>
the name Emlyn :-)
<br>
<p>Now that's just mean :-(
<br>
