<p>There are several assumptions [variables] inherent
<br>
in your model which can turn out very differently.
<br>
Colonizing new land does not expand uniformly in
<br>
all directions.  It generally follows the path of
<br>
least resistance to the greatest riches in the
<br>
shortest time frame.  But settlers do not always
<br>
follow the rules.  In the United States some early
<br>
European settlers lived far from the settlement
<br>
front a century before the later Europeans.  Some
<br>
met the natives and traded with them long before
<br>
significant war between the groups occurred.
<br>
Many settlers bypassed the Indians effectively
<br>
leaving them in the middle while growth occurred
<br>
on both sides.
<br>
<p>I see no good reason to assume that the most
<br>
advanced technology will be found near the
<br>
center of the expansion sphere.  Did all
<br>
modern technology arise out of Africa or
<br>
did a great deal of it happen in the United
<br>
States while it was still being settled?

<p>Your nanotech will be fighting, evading,
<br>
and hiding from other nanotech [both your
<br>
own, competing groups within your own
<br>
expansion sphere, and alien] much like
<br>
ants battling for supremacy.  Nanotech
<br>
will have to remain stealth or be destroyed.
<br>
Corrupted or obsolete nanotech will have to
<br>
be hunted by other nanotech or its presence
<br>
will betray you militarily.  If you cannot
<br>
control your nanotech it becomes a liability.
<br>
Stealth is not about remaining invisible
<br>
under all circumstances, it is about
<br>
minimizing your exposure and making the
<br>
enemy expend great resources if he wishes
<br>
to find you.  His expenditure of great
<br>
resources exposes him.

The

<p>Even bacteria only expand geometrically under

ideal circumstances and only for a finite

amount of time due to finite resources.
<br>
Introduce a single pathogen and all bets are
<br>
off.  Introduce multiple pathogens or
<br>
competitors and you develop an ecology.
<br>
With an endless Cold War of WoMD in space
<br>
you will be more concerned about avoiding
<br>
destruction than mining every last piece
<br>
of usable rock.  There is plenty of good
<br>
rock to graze on as you live the nomadic
<br>
life.  A missing rock here or there will
<br>
not raise red alerts like whole asteroids
<br>
mined and built into thousand mile long
<br>
space stations.
<br>
<p>Think militarily, I'm sure others have and
<br>
will.
<br>
<p>I see interlacing civilizations of nomads,
<br>
not colliding brick walls.  Sort of like
<br>
different species of bees forming dispersed
<br>
swarms.  One swarm can pass right through
<br>
another without conflict.  When conflict
<br>
does occur the decentralized nomadic nature
<br>
of both keeps it from spreading far.  WoMD
<br>
ensure the wise policy is to keep right on
<br>
moving.  Any ground you might claim can
<br>
be destroyed for much cheaper than you can
<br>
defend it.
