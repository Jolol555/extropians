<p>Are you sure this is an argument that you want to push? Suppose you 
<br>
succeed and everyone accepts this argument. Now if the U.S. does go to war 
<br>
without a second resolution, the U.N. is finished. On the other hand if 
<br>
everyone accepts Holbrooke's &quot;spin&quot; that a second resolution is not 
<br>
necessary, the U.N. will survived this episode. Given that the U.S. 
<br>
government seems determined to invade Iraq even without a second 
<br>
resolution, wouldn't you prefer the latter?
<br>
<p>I wonder if there are some in the Bush administration who would rather see
<br>
the Security Council totally discredited so that it can create a new
<br>
Security Council from scratch. The fact that France, a medium-sized
<br>
country in Europe, has veto power doesn't really make sense to me, and
<br>
neither does the fact that the non-permanent members seem to be selected
<br>
more or less randomly. Does anyone have any ideas about how the Security
<br>
Council might be redesigned more rationally?
<br>
<p>P.S. There is a great article about Kofi Annan and the U.N. in the current
<br>
issue (dated 2003-03-03) of the New Yorker magazine.
