As I read Natasha's post I saw the words...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;President, Extropy Institute 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.extropy.org">http://www.extropy.org</a> 
</em><br>
<p>A quick visit to the ExI website (I need to visit there more often) told me she has held the reins of power since January 20th of this year!     
<br>
<p>The actual Extropian Institute website news brief:
<br>
After serving as President of Extropy Institute for fifteen years, Max More has stepped down. On January 20th, the ExI Board of Directors elected Natasha Vita-More as the new President. Max More has also been elected to the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors, which he has informally held for some time. 
<br>
<p>As Chairman, Max More will be guiding more frequent meetings of the Board, focusing on increasing activity and productive focus on priorities. The Board will provide feedback to the President, and they will work together to pursue additional funding for the Institute and push for more effective organizational processes. 
<br>
<p>Known as a pioneering transhumanist and author of the Transhumanist Statement (1982) and the Transhumanist Timeline (1997), Natasha Vita-More established a cultural arts movement by putting into action her earnest focus on the serious fiction of arts and sciences. As President of ExI, she intends to develop a stronger Advisory Team, Online Net Learning, more multidisciplinary venues for ExI, grant writing, and a top-notch Extro-6 Conference to be held in the spring of 2004. 
<br>
<p>Natasha joined Extropy Institute in 1992. Over the years, she has been one of the most vocal proponents of extropian transhumanist ideas in the media. &quot;Please don't expect me to fill the shoes of Max More! Not only are his feet several sizes larger than my own, I also have a different stride and my footprints have traveled from a different horizon. I look forward to working with the Board, a newly developed Advisory Team, and building strong communications with our members and affiliates.&quot; 
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I must say I enjoyed Natasha's comment about not wanting to be expected to fill Max's shoes! lol  Though Max was a very capable and beloved president, I think it's great to now have Natasha leading with her own unique approach to things.  I just hope the President is not in bed with the Chairman because there could be a major conflict of interest. heehee!  I'm sorry, I just could not resist saying that! : ) 
<br>
<p>My best wishes go out to you Natasha, as you move forward to achieve all your goals for ExI.  Go kick some butt on the forces of statism and entropy!!
<br>
<p>sincerely,
<br>
<p>John (who is quietly helping build something wonderful in Arizona)
