<p><em>&gt; &gt; Civilizations that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reach approximately our level of achievement, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; takes merely a million years from the animal state,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quickly undergo some sort of singularity and expand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to encompass all solar systems in their galaxy.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; requires far less than one additional million years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So all told, we are talking about it taking less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; two million years for an animal to conquer a galaxy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not so sure I consider it silly.  You are accepting one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premises of May's argument: any two civilizations would eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become rivals for the same resources.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I'm recalling the conclusions of the argument 
<br>
without providing all the reasons.  So suppose that
<br>
we shortly (on geological time scales) begin expanding
<br>
the influence of our singularity at the speed of light.
<br>
<p>(When seen from a distance, this is the inevitable
<br>
speed, because if thousands or millions of spaceships
<br>
/ Von Neumann probes are in motion at the same time,
<br>
the speed of the overall effect is determined by the
<br>
arrival time of the longest voyages.)
<br>
<p>If there are other civilizations in the visible universe,
<br>
then they'll have their own wave front expanding at the
<br>
speed of light, and yes, there will be a collision.  But
<br>
there will be no advance notice of the meeting.  Moreover,
<br>
the wave front itself will be at the stage of technological
<br>
development that characterized the beginning stages of
<br>
expansion, not the stage meanwhile reached at the centers.
<br>
<p>So the collision will be on approximately equal terms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; one can't assume another civilization will want coexistence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if yours wants it.  The next point to be made would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how does one prevent oneself from being destroyed or overcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; May believes nomadism combined with stealth would be the answer.
</em><br>
<p>I think that each side would receive support---i.e., more
<br>
advanced technology---from the direction of its own center.
<br>
Whether the conflict is peaceful or warlike undoubtedly
<br>
depends on the profitability of trade at the boundary.
<br>
<p>Given nanotech, how is stealth possible?  Why wouldn't
<br>
my local civilization expand to use every single last
<br>
asteroid in the neighborhood?  Certainly, no solar system
<br>
will escape notice.  The growth of the singularity will
<br>
be geometric, both locally and globally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also think that absent centralized control -- as would happen with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization expanding into space -- there would be some chatter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we'd have picked it up by now if they were such a civilization active in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our galaxy.  So, again, I accept the null hypothesis here.
</em><br>
<p>All the ideas I've just written are pretty old; at least I
<br>
entertained them fifteen years ago.  A few times I've even
<br>
started SF stories, e.g. &quot;The Alien Advent&quot; to depict what
<br>
might happen if the expanding wave front of a civilization
<br>
were to reach here right now.  (But it's the usual first
<br>
contact type story, set only slightly differently.)
<br>
<p>You don't &quot;pick up any chatter&quot; until the civilization is
<br>
almost upon you.  A first sign in my story was when astronomers
<br>
noticed a certain galaxy turning red (as its Dyson spheres
<br>
went up).  From then, it was merely a short time before the
<br>
expanding civilization arrived, just behind their photons.
