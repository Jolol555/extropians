<a href="mailto:humania@t-online.de?Subject=Re:%20Time.com%20asks%20%20most%20dangerous%20country">humania@t-online.de</a> writes: A German expert on Iraq has published a book with 
<br>
the title &quot;Who will be crying for Abdul and Tanyana&quot; trying to direct the 
<br>
attention on the misery of the civil deaths in Iraq. Think about dead women 
<br>
and children too, when you will be proud to have conquered the oil wells with 
<br>
your American marine friends
<br>
<p>Sadowski,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, please &quot;Think about dead women and children.&quot;  Think of the 
<br>
women, children and elderly that have been starved or that have died because 
<br>
they have not received adequate medical care so Humania's friend Sadaam could 
<br>
have the money to buy WMDs.  Think of the people injured, killed or raped 
<br>
when Sadaam invaded Kuwait.  Think of the people gassed when Sadaam used gas 
<br>
against his own citizens.  Think of the people injured or killed when Sadaam 
<br>
fired scud missiles at a country, Israel, that wasn't even at war with him.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then pray that when it is all over that Sadaam is disposed, unable to 
<br>
ever trouble the peace of the world again.  Think deeply about the people 
<br>
that are injured or killed in disposing of Sadaam -- those kind of deaths no 
<br>
matter how unavoidable, if people are to live in freedom, are never easy.  
<br>
They are never desirable.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then think of something written long ago -- all that is necessary for 
<br>
evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.  All we have to do is to 
<br>
listen to the apologists that would be protectors of men like Sadaam offer us 
<br>
as a rationale for being slaves.
<br>
