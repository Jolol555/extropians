<br>
<p>mmb, that is true.  When the speed differential is too great the guy coming 
<br>
up behind you has to react to fast.  On a high speed highway they aren't 
<br>
mentally prepared for really slow traffic ahead of them.  I kid you not.  I 
<br>
have had two or three incidents in the hills when things got a bit hairy -- 
<br>
and I knew what was coming but had done everything possible to maintain my 
<br>
speed and get out of the way of overtaking traffic.  It &quot;ain't&quot; fun.
