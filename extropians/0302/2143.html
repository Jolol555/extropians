-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: Max M [mailto:<a href="mailto:maxmcorp@worldonline.dk?Subject=RE:%20Time.com%20asks%20you%20to%20vote%20for%20most%20dangerous%20country">maxmcorp@worldonline.dk</a>] 
<br>
<p>&quot;But what I really don't understand is that there is a relatively large
<br>
group here that practically *only* discuss politics. I frankly cannot see
<br>
why they should choose to do it here. There must be more interresting venues
<br>
for that.  It seems to me that the extropians list is really two lists. One
<br>
where politics are discussed, and one where extropian ideas are discussed.
<br>
And rarely does the two groups overlap.&quot;
<br>
<p>Your statement seems to imply that politics and extropian ideals are not
<br>
related.  I can not think that anything would be further from the truth.
<br>
The two are intimately and intrinsically linked.  You should instead say
<br>
'one list where extropian political ideas are discussed' and 'one list where
<br>
extropian science and technological ideas are discussed' But often these
<br>
will overlap, as in the discussion on nuclear power.  As I said in my post
<br>
to Amara on this subject
<br>
<p>&quot;Bringing about a better world for all humans is not only going to happen
<br>
through science and technology, but will necessarily require changes in
<br>
politics, economics, and the humanities, and as such a concentrated effort
<br>
to bring about that better world will necessarily require discussions of
<br>
those topics.&quot;
<br>
<p>As Extropy Vice Pres Greg Burch said on this topic
<br>
<p>&quot;First, I've asked myself the question of whether the subject of the Iraq
<br>
war has a sufficiently transhumanist or extropian component to warrant such
<br>
a huge portion of the bandwidth here.  In many ways, the subject is skew to
<br>
extropians interests, since the potential combatants on both sides have so
<br>
little sympathy for extropian ideas and ideals.  But, ultimately I suppose
<br>
there is sufficient relevance to the reason for this List's existence to
<br>
tolerate such a large volume of discussion: To name just three, questions of
<br>
war and peace on such a scale can effect that march of progress toward a
<br>
transhuman world, the evolution of methods of warfare will be relevant to
<br>
our interests, and the geopolitical alignment of the large interest groups
<br>
in the world over the next few decades will certainly have an impact on our
<br>
goals. &quot;
<br>
<p>If you have a plan to achieve a singularity, or a better world in general,
<br>
that does not have anything to do with politics, I would love to hear it.
<br>
There will be no singularity if computers are outlawed and we are all
<br>
reduced to substinence agriculture.
