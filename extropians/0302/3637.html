<em> &gt; Is Google Invading Your Privacy?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;You have to install the bar for them to gather information, and if you have
<br>
&nbsp;ever paid attention to the installation process, you choose whether or not
<br>
&nbsp;you want to report.  This is not an invasion of privacy whatsoever.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; A Site called Google Watch also describes several privacy problems with
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Google and discusses how the Google virtual monopoly could be
</em><br>
<em> &gt; undermining the Web by the methods their webcrawlers use to construct
</em><br>
<em> &gt; their databases.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; e.g. If your web site doesn't match their selection criteria it will
</em><br>
<em> &gt; never appear in their search results.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I've shown up on google in several instances, never putting any effort into
<br>
&nbsp;making my website 'google compatible'.  (I think it is mainly because of my
<br>
&nbsp;slashdotted article though)
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Quote:---------------
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Question:  What would be the fastest, most efficient, and most revealing
</em><br>
<em> &gt; approach to data mining the Internet?
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Answer:    Pay Google for a back-door feed on who's searching for what.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;That's a loaded ethical question with topic self-serving answer.  Just
<br>
&nbsp;because they could, doesn't mean they will, and moreso than any other large
<br>
&nbsp;internet 'foundation' I've found google to express their concerns for
<br>
ethics
<br>
&nbsp;and privacy.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Question:  Has Google ever, in their entire existence, issued any sort
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of statement suggesting that their sense of public responsibility would
</em><br>
<em> &gt; preclude being used in this way, or that the information they collect
</em><br>
<em> &gt; would never be sold for a price?
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Answer:    Not convincingly.*
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Pointless.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Question:  If Google decided to sell out, could they be held liable for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; privacy violations? Would we even find out about it?
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Answer:    No. The Homeland Security Act exempts companies from lawsuits
</em><br>
<em> &gt; or government prosecution after they turn over information to the new
</em><br>
<em> &gt; agency. Such information is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Officials who release this information can get up to six months in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; prison and a $5,000 fine.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Assuming this is not just irrelevant 'FUD', is the problem here REALLY with
<br>
&nbsp;Google?  Have they considered what other very large information consuming
<br>
&nbsp;companies could also do the same thing?  (i.e. google is not the only
<br>
search
<br>
&nbsp;engine, see: yahoo.com msn.com etc.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;... A silly person emailed me this same quoted information (or rather, sent
<br>
&nbsp;it to me via the infamously annoying ICQ).  The belief of the 'information'
<br>
&nbsp;which is rather opinionated seemed to be a quality of his limited
<br>
&nbsp;personality.  I have to ask you, what would promote these obvious claims of
<br>
&nbsp;possible actions and outcomes in hypothetical situations?  That seems more
<br>
&nbsp;interesting to me.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Ciao
<br>
