<em>&gt; &gt; A highly collimated laser radiating into the outer space, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a very very small angle, could show some effect. Because if waves were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beamed, at various directions in the outer space, and some power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fluctuations in the transmitter were observed, it could mean that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outer space is not uniform. That is to say that sometimes there are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or there are not, out there, &quot;targets&quot; receiving retarded waves and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emitting advanced waves.
</em><br>
<p>[Damien]
<br>
<em>&gt; My suggestion had been that by using this fact (if it is one!) you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establish a code with your future self (or descendents/later
</em><br>
collaborators)
<br>
<em>&gt; permitting a message to be sent back to the present, depending on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absence or presence of absorbers at various locations. I still think it's
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; rather nifty idea. But I wonder if I might have lifted it from a Greg Egan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determinism short story. (I don't have his collections handy, alas.)
</em><br>
<p>The essence of the Feynman-Wheeler absorber theory is the claim
<br>
that the source-less field term (of a certain equation) vanishes.
<br>
<p>This equation says that
<br>
F(k) = F(j,retarded) + F(free) + F(k,retarded) - F(k,advanced)
<br>
<p>where F(k) is the field of source j, seen by particle k
<br>
where F(j,retarded) is the usual retarded field acting on k from source j
<br>
where F(k,retarded) and F(k,advanced) are k's own advanced and retarded
<br>
fields
<br>
where F(free) is the source-less field term (advanced + retarded)
<br>
<p>Wheeler &amp; Feynman gave many reasons for the vanishing of F(free),
<br>
and there is little question that there was a cosmological era
<br>
in which the universe was opaque, functioning as an absorber.
<br>
<p>Even the cosmological background radiation is the result of
<br>
gamma-gamma, e+e-, neutrinos, charged particles annihilations,
<br>
and not a F(free). In any case the vanishing of F(free) depends
<br>
essentially on the present properties of the (near) universe.
<br>
<p>Experimental attemps were made to observe a possible failure,
<br>
or partial failure of the absorption of F(free).
<br>
<p>In example alternately exposing an antenna to the sky, at night,
<br>
or shielding it. Figuring that the radiation reaction should be
<br>
affected, causing variations in the power or in the current in the
<br>
antenna or in something else there. Experiments were not conclusive.

for a possible Damienscope!
