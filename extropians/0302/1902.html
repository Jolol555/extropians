In a message dated 2/2/2003 11:16:29 AM Central Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:tilley314@attbi.com?Subject=Re:%20&quot;At%20NASA%20we%20believe%20in%20round-trips.&quot;">tilley314@attbi.com</a> writes: Do you ever see us going back to the moon?
<br>
<p>Yes, absolutely and to Mars also.  Help me come up with the name of Senator 
<br>
Bill______ the ex Astronaut from Florida.  My memory fails me at the moment.  
<br>
I shall refer to him here after as Senator Bill.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning I was listening to Senators Bill and Hutchinson on a TV 
<br>
talk (political) show.  They seemed to agree that 
<br>
1.  We cut the space program way back during the 70s.  That since that time 
<br>
we really haven't had a manned program that emphacized exploration.
<br>
2.  That someday the space program would pay great dividends and that the US 
<br>
should take the lead not wait for others to profit from space exploration.
<br>
3.  That we should step out and take the lead with bold programs not only 
<br>
aimed at putting man back on the Moon but also putting man on Mars.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator Bill also said that another ex-astronaut friend of his named 
<br>
Chang was developing a plasma rocket that would reduce a trip to Mars to:
<br>
1.  A matter of months.
<br>
2.  Provide a sense of gravity through constant acceleration.
<br>
3.  Provide magnetic protection against certain harmful radiation.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can any of you cast more light on this?
<br>
Ron h.
