Was the space shuttle useful? Not really.

<br>
<p>In the days since the explosion of the space shuttle Columbia, NASA officials
<br>
have repeatedly reminded us that space travel is inherently dangerous. They
<br>
clearly are right. If passenger aircraft blew up as often as space shuttles have
<br>
(twice in 113 missions), there would be 20 catastrophic accidents every day at
<br>
La Guardia alone. 
<br>
<p>The crashes of Challenger and Columbia killed 14 crew members and destroyed half
<br>
of America's original shuttle fleet. President Bush, the Wall Street Journal,
<br>
and others have assured us that enduring such extraordinary losses is both
<br>
necessary and worthwhile. In truth, though, the shuttle program has never been
<br>
either of those things. NASA's original plan was to create a vehicle that would
<br>
make quick round trips between the Earth and an orbiting space stationbut then
<br>
Congress, in 1969, refused to pay for both programs, and space officials, forced
<br>
to choose, elected to build the bus without the destination. They rationalized
<br>
their toy by claiming that it would make ordinary rockets obsolete. But the
<br>
shuttle has proved instead to be so expensive and undependable that virtually
<br>
all satellites nowadays are propelled into orbit on old-fashioned disposable
<br>
launchers. On the rare occasions when the shuttle is still used to launch a
<br>
satellite, the payload is typically one that originated with NASA itselfsuch as
<br>
Starshine, an inert, hollow, mirror-covered sphere 19 inches in diameter that
<br>
the crew of the shuttle Discovery carried into low orbit in the spring of 1999
<br>
and essentially threw overboard so that high-school astronomers (who had pitched
<br>
in to polish the mirrors) could track it with telescopes and predict when it
<br>
would plummet back to Earth, as it did a few months later. 
<br>
<p>NASA officials and their supporters have often claimed that the shuttle program
<br>
has produced a &quot;six-fold return&quot; on our staggering investment in it. For that
<br>
number to be accurate, though, each shuttle mission would have to have generated
<br>
something like $4 billion in economic benefitsan impossibility. In fact, it's
<br>
tough to identify any significant benefits at all. NASA annually produces a
<br>
publication called &lt;<a href="http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff2002/index1.html">http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff2002/index1.html</a>&gt;Spinoff,
<br>
which claims to document &quot;successfully commercialized NASA technology&quot; from the
<br>
preceding year, but almost all the shuttle-related claims are strained in the
<br>
extreme: A sports bra made from a material also used in shuttle spacesuits helps
<br>
to reduce &quot;mammary bounce&quot;; a type of synthetic netting used in shuttles has
<br>
also been used in the decks of racing catamarans; a composite material developed
<br>
by Babcock &amp; Wilcox for use in certain kinds of tubing on the space shuttle was
<br>
later also used for &quot;improving golf clubs&quot; by providing &quot;maximum distance.&quot; 
<br>
<p>It is almost impossible to find a shuttle spinoff that is the product of an
<br>
actual shuttle-based experiment or project rather than a result of the design,
<br>
construction, operation, or maintenance of the shuttle itself. For example, NASA
<br>
boasts that leftover fuel from shuttle missions is used &quot;to save livesby
<br>
destroying land mines.&quot; But any incendiary substance could be used to blow up
<br>
land mines; employing excess shuttle fuel for that purpose does not make
<br>
land-mine destruction a &quot;benefit&quot; of the space program. Almost all alleged
<br>
shuttle spinoffs are of this type. 
<br>
<p>When a commercial product or application truly is developed on a shuttle
<br>
mission, the shuttle's real contribution usually has to do only with marketing.
<br>
For example, in 1998, International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. sponsored a
<br>
shuttle experiment in which buds of a certain variety of rose were allowed,
<br>
under the supervision of John Glenn, to blossom during a shuttle flight.
<br>
According to IFF, exposure to microgravity during blooming led to an unspecified
<br>
&quot;shift in the scent&quot; of the blossoms. &quot;Essential oils&quot; supposedly similar to
<br>
those produced by the shuttle roses were later included, among roughly two dozen
<br>
other ingredients, in a perfume (called Zen) made by Japan's largest cosmetics
<br>
company. The IFF press release announcing the breakthrough said: &quot;This heavenly
<br>
scent has come down to Earth in a product designed to enhance mood as well as to
<br>
delight those who smell it. It also serves to remind us that reaching for the
<br>
stars can result in down-to-Earth delights.&quot; Last year, Unilever became the
<br>
second company to use the fragrance in a product by adding it to a deodorant
<br>
called Impulse, which &quot;caters to the energetic and vibrant girls who believe in
<br>
living life to the fullest!&quot; but isn't sold in the United States. 
<br>
<p>On that same shuttle mission in 1998, Glenn took part in a series of experiments
<br>
that NASA said had been inspired by apparent similarities between space travel
<br>
and old ageboth of which cause &quot;bone and muscle loss, balance disorders and
<br>
sleep disturbances.&quot; The investigation consisted of monitoring Glenn's
<br>
temperature at night, collecting samples of his blood and urine, and asking him
<br>
questions about the quality of his sleep, among other things. NASA hoped that
<br>
these data might lead to the creation of &quot;a model system to help scientists
<br>
interested in understanding aging&quot;although no such model resulted from the
<br>
mission, and no earthbound scientist not connected with the program ever asked
<br>
NASA to produce one. (Besides, if the apparent similarities between aging and
<br>
space travel really are meaningful, wouldn't it have made more sense to conduct
<br>
the experiment in reverse, by observing Earth's plentiful supply of old people
<br>
and then applying any lessons learned to the comparatively small population of
<br>
shuttle passengers? After all, we earthlings have been generating data about the
<br>
effects of aging for several million years, and we know exactly how the
<br>
experiment ends.) 
<br>
<p>The scientific investigations undertaken during Columbia's final voyage were
<br>
similar to those conducted during Glenn's mission five years earlier; indeed,
<br>
they were similar to the experiments conducted on nearly every manned American
<br>
space voyage that has ever taken place. For example, eight Australian spiders
<br>
aboard Columbia added to our understanding of weightless web-weaving, a subject
<br>
NASA first studied aboard Skylab in 
<br>
1973. (According to an Australian wire-service report filed three days before
<br>
the accident, the spider experiment &quot;could result in scientists mimicking the
<br>
structure of spider silk for use in aerospace structures and space
<br>
stations&quot;proving that NASA isn't the only hyperbolic self-promoter in the
<br>
world.) And International Flavors &amp; Fragrances was back on board, in partnership
<br>
with the Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics, to grow a few more
<br>
fragrant plants in one of the shuttle's standard glove-compartment-sized
<br>
experiment drawers. 
<br>
<p>There were more serious experiments on Columbia as well, of course. But all of
<br>
those experiments could have been performed more easily, economically, and
<br>
safely aboard an unmanned spacecraft (as in the case of the dust-storm
<br>
observation experiment); or addressed questions that NASA had already answered
<br>
years, if not decades, before (as in the case of all the experiments designed to
<br>
measure the effects of microgravity on living things); or had no chance
<br>
whatsoeverassuming that NASA's long history in this area provides an accurate
<br>
guideof leading to any truly useful discovery or breakthrough (as in the case of
<br>
all the experiments aimed at creating new drugs, growing proteins, curing
<br>
cancer, and the like). In the end, Columbia's main contribution to human
<br>
knowledge will likely be yet another candidate for Spinoff magazine, though it
<br>
will be a big one: By the end of this year, we will know more than we ever did
<br>
before about how to collect, catalog, and analyze the debris of a space-flight
<br>
disaster.
