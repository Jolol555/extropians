The Galileo tape-recorder is retired today. Then only realtime
<br>
(mostly infrequent) data.
<br>
<p>Saturday, September 20, 2003 is the day to tune in to Galileo
<br>
and its last nineteen hours of 'life' before impact into Jupiter.
<br>
<p><p>This Year on Galileo
<br>
November 5, 2002 - September 20, 2003
<br>
<p>The Story So Far...
<br>
<p>As usual for the combination of an aging spacecraft and an intensely
<br>
energetic environment, Jupiter dealt Galileo a temporarily crippling blow
<br>
during our flyby of Amalthea on Tuesday, November 5, 2002. Approximately 17
<br>
minutes after zipping by the tiny satellite at over 18 kilometers per
<br>
second (41,000 miles per hour), as the spacecraft neared its closest
<br>
approach to the giant planet, the intensity of the radiation caused a
<br>
failure in computer circuitry that handles timing of the events on the
<br>
spacecraft. This caused the computer to switch to a set of backup
<br>
circuitry, which is a serious enough change to warrant the computer to
<br>
declare an emergency, shut down operations, and phone home for help. Even
<br>
in this relatively quiet state for the spacecraft, the radiation
<br>
environment was still raging, and several additional faults triggered
<br>
repeated software requests to place (or in this case, keep) the spacecraft
<br>
computers in safe mode.
<br>
<p>Once Galileo had cleared the depths of Jupiter's radiation field, engineers
<br>
could start wading through the flood of error messages received to
<br>
determine which ones represented temporary conditions, now passed, and
<br>
which might represent permanent failures in spacecraft systems.
<br>
Surprisingly, with the exception of the switched timing circuit, there
<br>
appeared to be no hard failures! Indications were that we had successfully
<br>
captured two full tracks of recorded science data, including the orbiter
<br>
instruments' first taste of the environment well inside Io's orbit. It
<br>
appeared that the spacecraft systems, though showing expected additional
<br>
wear and tear due to the radiation exposure, were all still in operating
<br>
condition! Computer processing, telecommunications, and attitude control
<br>
were still providing the heartbeats of a working spacecraft.
<br>
<p>Then it was time to begin to retrieve the digital gold stored on the tape
<br>
recorder, and that was when the headaches returned. On Friday, November 8,
<br>
2002, test commands were sent to the recorder to attempt a short movement
<br>
of the tape. Engineering measurements indicated that the tape did not move,
<br>
and the signs pointed to a different problem than the sticky tape that has
<br>
affected operations in the past. Over the next month diagnostic tests were
<br>
run both on the spacecraft and on the ground that convinced engineers that
<br>
the problem was most likely a radiation-induced failure in
<br>
light-emitting-diode circuitry in the motor control of the recorder.
<br>
Radiation experts suggested that time spent away from the radiation
<br>
environment, as well as running current through the circuits without moving
<br>
the tape, might help anneal the circuitry and allow a return to operations.
<br>
<p>More tests were performed on the spacecraft, during which over 111 hours of
<br>
current was applied to the circuits, and eventually limited motion was
<br>
restored! (Imagine a doctor trying to diagnose an illness when the patient
<br>
is a half a billion miles away, and he has to wait at least an hour and a
<br>
half between asking a question and receiving an answer! This is the nature
<br>
of deep-space operations.) Though not fully operational, enough tape motion
<br>
was possible to allow the playback process to return data. Finally, on
<br>
Thursday, December 12, 2002, with careful control of the amount of motion
<br>
allowed, playback of the recorded science data began.
<br>
<p>Throughout this tape diagnostic period, standard maintenance of other
<br>
on-board systems continued. On November 15, December 6 and December 27, the
<br>
propulsion system was exercised to keep the lines cleared. On November 14
<br>
and January 7, tests of the gyroscopes were performed. These activities
<br>
were in support of the final attitude change in the mission, on January 15,
<br>
2003. This turn was also the largest that Galileo has performed in three
<br>
years, changing the pointing of the spacecraft by 18 degrees. At this final
<br>
attitude, the communications antenna is now pointed in a direction that
<br>
will be only 2.5 degrees away from Earth in mid-September 2003, when
<br>
Galileo next and finally encounters Jupiter.
<br>
<p>As part of final cleanup from the safing activities of early November, on
<br>
December 16 and 18 the Plasma Subsystem and Energetic Particle Detector
<br>
were turned on and configured for science data acquisition. These two
<br>
instruments were turned off in response to the problems encountered in the
<br>
intense radiation bombardment.
<br>
<p>Since very few communications passes are scheduled with the giant antennas
<br>
of NASA's Deep Space Network between now and September, on January 15, the
<br>
spacecraft was instructed not to worry if it doesn't hear from ground
<br>
controllers.
<br>
<p>The Story Yet To Come...
<br>
<p>Playback of the recorded Amalthea and Jupiter radiation environment data
<br>
will continue until Friday, February 28. At that time, the playback process
<br>
is stopped, and the tape recorder, that workhorse of data collection and
<br>
return for Galileo over the past seven years, is consigned to a
<br>
well-deserved retirement.
<br>
<p>With playback completed, the Fields and Particles instruments (Dust
<br>
Detector, Energetic Particle Detector, Heavy Ion Counter, Magnetometer,
<br>
Plasma Subsystem, and Plasma Wave Subsystem) are configured to send their
<br>
data directly to Earth in real time, and the spacecraft continues on its
<br>
long, slow loop away from Jupiter before returning for our terminal
<br>
encounter with the giant planet in September.
<br>
<p>At this time, the high level of spacecraft monitoring via the Deep Space
<br>
Network antennas that has characterized the past thirteen years drops to
<br>
one contact per week, just enough to verify the health and status of the
<br>
craft, and to verify that it is still on the correct trajectory. With the
<br>
exception of a few flight controllers, the flight team, which once numbered
<br>
in the hundreds, has moved on to other projects, other jobs, other lives.
<br>
<p>The distant orbital loop takes the spacecraft farther from Jupiter than it
<br>
has been since before entering orbit in December 1995. On April 14, Galileo
<br>
reaches 370 Jupiter radii (26.4 million kilometers or 16.4 million miles)
<br>
from the planet. This is about 1/6 the distance from Earth to the Sun, and
<br>
light takes nearly a minute and a half to travel from Jupiter to the
<br>
spacecraft!
<br>
<p>During the summer months, as the Earth proceeds in its own orbit about the
<br>
Sun, Jupiter, with Galileo in tow, appears to pass behind the Sun, an event
<br>
known as Solar Conjunction. This limits our ability to hear from the
<br>
spacecraft, due to interference from the Sun's turbulent atmosphere.
<br>
Between Monday, July 28 and Monday, September 15, the radio signal from
<br>
Galileo changes to put more power into the carrier signal, giving the
<br>
ground antennas a better chance to receive the signal.
<br>
<p>Between Tuesday, August 11, and Monday, September 1, the spacecraft is
<br>
within 7 degrees of the Sun as seen from Earth, and communications of any
<br>
sort are not expected. The spacecraft appears to be closest to the Sun on
<br>
Friday, August 22, when the separation between the two is only 0.83 degrees.
<br>
<p>On Thursday, September 18, Galileo is again streaking in towards Jupiter,
<br>
and reaches 50 Jupiter radii (3.6 million kilometers or 2.2 million miles)
<br>
from the planet. Finally on Saturday, September 20, just before 6 p.m.
<br>
Pacific Daylight Time, Galileo is just over 18 Jupiter radii out, and a
<br>
scant 19 hours before impact with the clouds.
<br>
<p>For the conclusion of Galileo's trek through the solar system, tune in
<br>
again in early September!
