<p>As stated in the following abstract, from DATATOP, &quot;The study found that
<br>
deprenyl [selegiline] treatment almost halved the risk of reaching a

stage of Parkinsonism at which the start of levodopa treatment becomes

imperative for lessening disability.&quot;

<p>That looks like potent neuroprotection to me.

<p>ABSTRACT:
<br>
Deprenyl's effect at slowing progression of parkinsonian disability: the
<br>
DATATOP study. The Parkinson Study Group.
<br>
LeWitt PA
<br>
Acta Neurol Scand Suppl 1991  136:79-86
<br>
<p>Studying a cohort of 800 mildly-affected parkinsonians, the North
<br>
American DATATOP* project has concluded that progression in disability
<br>
can be attenuated by the use of deprenyl, 10 mg/day. Interim results of
<br>
this controlled clinical trial were reported after participants received
<br>
treatment for an average of 12 months. The study found that deprenyl
<br>
treatment almost halved the risk of reaching a stage of Parkinsonism at
<br>
which the start of levodopa treatment becomes imperative for lessening
<br>
disability. In addition to this study end-point, other ratings supported
<br>
an improved clinical outcome from the chronic deprenyl (DP) regimen. The
<br>
34 investigators conducted clinical evaluations both while subjects
<br>
received medication and after a 4-week wash-out. Though some subjects
<br>
experienced mild symptomatic improvements of Parkinsonism from DP, these
<br>
effects were insufficient to account for the DP-treated group's delay at
<br>
reaching the study end-point. In addition to DP, this placebo-controlled
<br>
double-blind study also assessed the possibility of protective effects
<br>
from another antioxidative strategy, a 2,000 I.U./day regimen of
<br>
alpha-tocopherol. To date, results of the latter trial have not been
<br>
reported. Monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) metabolism of dopamine
<br>
generates hydrogen peroxide and, thereby, an oxidative stress on the
<br>
nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron. The inhibition of MAO-B by DP may
<br>
have been the means by which progression of Parkinsonism was attenuated,
<br>
although other mechanisms are also tenable. DATATOP has pointed to the
<br>
potential for arresting the progression of Parkinson's disease, and has
<br>
provided an unparalleled opportunity to study the clinical course and
<br>
neurochemical indices of untreated Parkinsonism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT
<br>
