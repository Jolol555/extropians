<p>Can't answer you directly, but I can tell you some stuff I _have_ read that relates.
<br>
<p>There are several remote-EM weapons types. Off the top of my head, and ignoring
<br>
overlap across categories for convenience, here are the ones I can think of:
<br>
<p>There's plain vanilla nukes and tailored EMP-rich nukes, at least in principle.
<br>
These can be subdivided into supercritical (boom) and subcritical (fizzle) systems.
<br>
<p>There's MHD-powered EM, both EMP and directed-microwave. Some of these configurations
<br>
destroy a baseball-style single loop coil and pinch exotic materials. In some designs
<br>
(don't know how practical), some of the stuff being squeezed is a subcritical nuclear
<br>
or thermonuclear &quot;pit&quot;. In others, it's all conventional-explosives driven into a
<br>
big old supercapacitor, and it emits a cone of microwaves down the axis of the
<br>
low-drag bomb. I've seen drawings of that one.
<br>
<p>Then there's HERF other than those sorts, for instance the weird but possibly-
<br>
practical-soon &quot;ionize air columns with a pair of lasers, then run gobs of ~100-MHz
<br>
RF through the columns and induce secondary currents in the interior&quot; one, and the
<br>
plain old &quot;hit them with a gob of microwaves from a gutted Radarange and see if they
<br>
fall over/see if their receiver input stage fries&quot; one.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/defense/DirectEngery.pdf">http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/defense/DirectEngery.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>has some stuff on microwave weapons. I love the typo in the URL.
<br>
<p>What little I *do* know about this stuff comes from the FAS and one electronics
<br>
seminar. The seminar used EMP strictly to refer to NEMP--Nuclear EMP.
<br>
<p>I think I have a copy of a paper around here somewhere called &quot;EMP will do WHAT?!?&quot;
<br>
(with the n-times-xeroxed smurfy guys rolling on the floor laughing, taken from the
<br>
ancient &quot;You want it WHEN?!?&quot; office art). All unclassified, but with some useful
<br>
hints. The paper was pretty much exclusively concerning nuclear weapons effects on
<br>
local systems; they didn't talk about zillions of volts being induced on long
<br>
telephone lines, etc. Let me recap what I think I know from that, about nuclear EMP.
<br>
<p>When a nuke goes off, you get a brilliant expanding shell of gamma radiation, something
<br>
around 90 nanoseconds thick. That's what they said; I'm guessing the duration of that
<br>
is useable to measure yield in a nonlinear way.
<br>
<p>EMP was described in that paper as AEMP and SEMP. A(tmospheric)EMP is to some degree
<br>
shieldable-against with one or more conductive (Faraday cage) layers. S(ystem)EMP, in
<br>
contrast, is vey hard to shield against.
<br>
<p>AEMP: comes from the massive gamma burst of a nuclear fireball getting forward-scattered, ionizing the heck out of the air, being
<br>
reradiated by ionized electrons falling back to lower states, and consequently smeared
<br>
into a DC-to-daylight stretched pulse of (RF/EM) photons, with both a strong e field
<br>
and a strong b (magnetic) field.
<br>
<p>SEMP: When the remaining gamma (and to a probably lesser extent, beta) penetrates into
<br>
the target, you get a buttload of EM, &quot;bremmstrahlung&quot; und so weiter, and the Faraday
<br>
shielding gets electrons knocked off of it just like any other X-ray-machine target.
<br>
<p>With both, you can also get the circuits inside responding to the various induced/
<br>
produced currents as transformer secondaries.
<br>
<p>A lot of EMP countermeasures boil down to &quot;shunt what you can&quot; (the &quot;lightning
<br>
arrestor&quot; approach), &quot;be built to take it&quot; (conservative design that can function after
<br>
degradation &amp; damage), and &quot;notice when you have latched up, and reboot&quot; (scr-latching
<br>
is a thing that happens when you bias some ICs' PNPN structure funny--they chip turns
<br>
into a big &quot;on&quot; power switch and basically shorts the power supply until you _completely_
<br>
remove the juice).
<br>
<p>Yes, UAVs are exposed. So are F-16s. There are always tradeoffs.
