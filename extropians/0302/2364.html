According to one TV programme, MJ has approximately $300million US under his
<br>
actual control. The rest is debted out.
<br>
<p>I don't know how serious he is about life extension. Another
<br>
millionaire -turned- cyber artist/wacko with 10 million $ US makes specific
<br>
reference to Mind Children as his &quot;go&quot; card for the future (see Wired, Nov.
<br>
2000 (Josh Harris) : &quot;Having read Hans Moravec's seminal book Mind Children,
<br>
Harris believes that the human race will, within the next century, replace
<br>
itself with intelligent machines or human-electronic hybrids. 'We're in the
<br>
middle of an evolutionary shift,' he says... 'I want to guide [the imminent
<br>
transition] it,'...&quot;) Someone should send him a copy of Engines of Creation!
<br>
<p>As an end note: the only good plastic surgery is that which cannot be
<br>
distinguished from the real thing. Current plastic surgery is only partial
<br>
in that there is no detailed control of the skin surface or scarring. Also,
<br>
skeletal alteration is very limited and extremely crude by forthcoming
<br>
standards. Genetic therapies can potentially alter skeletal structures
<br>
(100,000 genes). This will enhance surgery, along with nanotech
<br>
instruments/devices and techniques.

<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; The last I heard Michael Jackson had a net worth of several hundred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million dollars. Not to say that could not evaporate through business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealings. However, even if he has total control over say 100,000,000$ to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend on the sole purpose of keeping himself youthful, and functionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious for  an indeterminate  period of time in excess of 200 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is akin to a manhatten project to fight aging.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ====
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have read that Michael Jackson was on the verge of bankruptcy due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the large burn rate or the Neverland ranch upkeep.  He's playing zoo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tycoon and theme park tycoon with real money and he's the only paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customer.  Sure there's enough money for a hyperbaric chamber and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimental pharmaceuticals but I've yet to hear of any medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research funded by his wealth like the Bill and Melisa Gates foundation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While Bill is not publicly pushing the life-extension agenda at this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point.  You can bet with the existing infrastructure the foundation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building that he will bring resources to bear on aging as he gets older.
