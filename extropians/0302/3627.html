</em><br>
<p>I was actually able to find a passage which explains why augmentation is 
<br>
impossible.  In the second chapter, right before the singularity, Lawrence 
<br>
enters this into his creation:  &quot;Force Association: Interpreting the 
<br>
contents of a human being's mind in order to understand or predict its 
<br>
behavior shall be a violation of the First Law of severity two.&quot; This seems 
<br>
to pretty much prevent the enhancement of humans by the budding SI.
<br>
<p>The author goes into a bit of depth on exactly how the creator did so badly 
<br>
in making his SI:

<br>
<p>In short, the fictional programmer hadn't read anything by Eliezer on how 
<br>
to do it right.
<br>
<p>Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.  Don't assign 
<br>
to stupidity what might be due to ignorance.  And try not to assume you 
<br>
opponent is the ignorant one-until you can show it isn't you.
