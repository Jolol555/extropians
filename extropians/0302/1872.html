best to avoid adverts, but this (from the Opera webpages) was interesting to me...
<br>
Opera Small-Screen Rendering
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think it's absolutely phenomenal technology.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Michael Gartenberg, Jupiter Research 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...[Opera's]...new software will help transform the wireless web from a misnomer into a reality.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The Economist 
<br>
<p>Most sites are written for, and tested exclusively on desktop computers with large color monitors. Mobile wireless devices typically have much smaller screens, and until today, it has been a challenge to present Web pages on these. Opera's Small-Screen Rendering technology intelligently reformats today's Web sites to fit inside the screen width, thereby eliminating the need for horizontal scrolling.
<br>
<p>How do we do it?
<br>
Content reformatting - Instead of presenting table content in columns and rows, tables are reformatted into a one-dimensional structure that better fits smaller screens. Opera can selectively scale down large images or remove those that are superfluous, as well as some other tricks that make the pages fit small screens. And as a result, the user has no need for a horizontal scrollbar.
<br>
<p>Zooming - Additionally, Opera can zoom pages in and out, and this is a powerful way to get the overview of a complex Web page, while also being able to magnify certain parts of the page. Visually impaired users can zoom out on a page to achieve legible font sizes for reading. By reversing the operation, Opera can show a Web page written for desktop on a small screen.
