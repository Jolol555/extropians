<em>&gt; I have to disagree. It's not just that one more or less random attempt

</em><br>
<p>Sure. But there are many possible GM interventions; genetic regulation 
<br>
is a fertile field. For example, adding promotors to the genes that 
<br>
causes them to excise themselves (&quot;exorcist technology&quot; as ETC dubbed 
<br>
it) in the pollen seems to be a practical way of reducing the chance of 
<br>
spreading enormously. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt; But a senior lecturer at Melbourne University's Botany School, Edward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Newbigin, said that although the rate was not zero, it was &quot;not going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurable&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While the foreign gene infected one seed in 16,000, only one seed in about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10,000 made it to a neighbouring non-GM field. This was a total rate of one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seed in 160 million, he said. &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know how many seeds get sown in any given planting season. I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine it might be more than that. And Dr Newbigin didn't say, `Oh, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course they'll now abandon this failed approach.' He seems to imply that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk is acceptably small, which is only a relevant comment if the method is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be used, no?
</em><br>
<p>I doubt your interpretation about that the method is likely to be used
<br>
since he defended it that way. If you had spent a lot of time on a
<br>
project that didn't pan out, would you say that it was all bad or would
<br>
you say that it *nearly* worked? 
<br>
<p>But I agree that it is a somewhat lame attempt at avoiding GM fears.
<br>
People will indeed figure out that once chance in 160 million means a
<br>
lot, and given the use of the precautionary principle to mean &quot;if there
<br>
is any risk, forget about it&quot; even a small chance would be seen as too
<br>
risky. 
<br>
<p>There are acceptable risks, but they have to be explained more carefully 
<br>
than &quot;the risk is so small that you don't need to worry&quot;.
