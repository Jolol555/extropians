<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Buzz%20in%20Baghdad">samantha@objectent.com</a> writes: This is absurd.  I was a member of Quaker and 
<br>
other groups opposed to the war.  We received no funding from anyone except 
<br>
those who volunteered funds, needed materials, time and a lot of sweat and 
<br>
heart.  To believe some politicized claims at face value and to utterly 
<br>
disbelieve the integrity of all those who opposed Vietnam says very poor 
<br>
things about the credibility of your statements in this area.
<br>
<p>Samantha,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wish to learn for yourself there is ample evidence that you are 
<br>
wrong.  In the immediate sense you may not have known you were being led.  
<br>
But some of the people that led you have come forward to explain how they led 
<br>
you by the nose.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it is part and parcel of modern asymetric warfare theory 
<br>
to undercut our political leadership and our military by encouraging peace 
<br>
demonstrations.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example if you lurked among the Moslem site I listen in on you 
<br>
would know that the Moslems supporting Sadaam were among the planers and 
<br>
organizers of the English demonstrations.  Supporters of Sadaam Hussein are 
<br>
attempting to throw Tony Blair out of office for having the guts to oppose 
<br>
Sadaam.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, don't argue with those of us that tell you this -- go argue with 
<br>
those that led you and have since gone public.
<br>
Ron h.
