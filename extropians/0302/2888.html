I would say the thread was about Power rather then democracy.
<br>
But let us treat this as a thought experiment and deal with conclusions and 
<br>
goals, realistically, one hopes.
<br>
<p>I asked earlier, if we Ami's are so rotten, given the resistance of 
<br>
involvement in other areas where massacres might have been alleviated; what 
<br>
our the opponents of a new American empire going to do about it? My question 
<br>
is how can you enforce, what will you do to punish, what will you do to 
<br>
retaliate? 
<br>
<p>Can you compel the Americans to throw George Bush Jr. into prison? How might 
<br>
this be actually accomplished? Would you guess that foreign protests will 
<br>
influence American policy in a way that pleases you?
<br>
<p>Yours in Cthulu,
<br>
Mitch
<br>
<p>Humania opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;So, this mail exchange between you and Kai was about democracy, right? I 
<br>
remember one very young guy at the Berlin rally this weekend, where 500.000 
<br>
people protested against a war on Iraq, maybe he was 19 or 20. He carried a 
<br>
poster that said: &quot;Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity&quot;. When a 
<br>
reporter asked him about his political stance he said: &quot;I believe in 
<br>
democracy. That's what my parents learned from the USA. And if my trust in 
<br>
the American democracy is justified, George Troubleyou Bush will end his life 
<br>
in a prison as a war criminal.&quot;
<br>
 
<br>
Mitch, you see, we Germans have learned our lesson and do oppose governments 
<br>
who are about to commit a crime with a preemptive war.
