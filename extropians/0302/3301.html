<p><em>&gt; &gt; [Brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For my part I wonder sometimes if my atheism which I think is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a position I've arrived at intellectually rather than emotionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may bias my perceptions more towards being willing to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hawkish when the circumstances require it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I grew up in a Christian tradition (Roman Catholic secondary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; school and all) and went through the stages of agnostic to atheist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in my mid to late teens. ......
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I grew up with the very same mind set and became an atheist in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my late teens. But it was in post war Germany, so I aquired the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes of my  generation (I was born 1954) that no country 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should engage in a war anymore except when it is attacked.
</em><br>
<p>So if I understand you correctly you see your position as strongly
<br>
influenced by prevailing German cultural memes of post war
<br>
Germany which include a strong never-again reaction to Hitler
<br>
and his wars of invasion? And this is based on a rich appreciation
<br>
of the consequences of wars of invasion both for people in the
<br>
countries invaded and then ultimately for the German people 
<br>
themselves when the invasions were responded to ultimately by
<br>
counter invasion?
<br>
<p>Is this so?
<br>
<p>If it is so then I think maybe this is an understandable over-
<br>
correction but an over-correction nonetheless. 
<br>
<p>I see it as an over-correction because the logistics of modern
<br>
warfare are such that if you wait until the invaders are actually
<br>
attacking your country in force and don't take some preparatory
<br>
steps in response to what are apparently preparatory steps being 
<br>
made by the potential aggressor then you wait too long either to 
<br>
have a deterrent or to have an effective defence. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In that case, of course it is justified to defend your life and I would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably learn to use a gun very quickly. And I know that some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contemporary Christian think tanks (yes, the DO have some :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are finally talking about a &quot;just peace&quot; - in the case of Iraq - 
</em><br>
<p>Interesting. Is that &quot;just peace&quot; a reference to the war that hasn't
<br>
started (the US build-up of forces etc) or are they perhaps talking
<br>
of the need to bring peace to Iraqi citizen's under Saddam?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; instead of  a &quot;just war&quot; or a holy war, which had been a Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dogma through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ages. There is a congregation (?) in Rome, forgot its name. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were already nominated for the Peace Nobel Prize. Maybe one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our Italian friends knows who I am talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, coming back to the topic: The USA are NOT attacked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Saddam, 
</em><br>
<p>Granted. Not yet. But  Saddam was not cooperating with UN
<br>
resolutions and the terms of the Gulf War ceasefire. He definitely was
<br>
not doing so before Bush raised the ante on him with a military build up
<br>
and by lobbying, so hard, so far, within the appropriate forum, the UN
<br>
Security Council.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so  they have no bloody right to invade his country and piss at his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; garden fence with a GPS penis.
</em><br>
<p>The US hasn't done that yet and may not have to if the Security Council
<br>
members do their job's well enough. This is the pivotal point. If
<br>
the Security Council doesn't *effectively* provide *security* the
<br>
Security Council and the UN are not able to perform their functions
<br>
as agreed in the UN Charter. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is a crime and Troubleyou Bush will be a criminal if he does so.
</em><br>
<p>It is not a crime yet. Bush is not guilty of invading Iraq yet against the
<br>
UN Charter and against 1441 yet. He is engaged in brinkmanship 
<br>
with Saddam - a career brinkman who may not take anything else
<br>
seriously, but he has not yet invaded Iraq. It is not a *crime* to 
<br>
engage Saddam with brinkmanship. It is not a *crime* to lobby the
<br>
Security Council even very strongly. It is not a *crime* for a
<br>
US President to be a poor statesman or a poor communicator.
