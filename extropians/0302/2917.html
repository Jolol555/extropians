<em>&gt; ##Emlyn, please don't make such unfounded charges without any

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that charge -- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there isn't any.  
</em><br>
<p>The US has weapons of mass destruction. Nuclear weapons. It really does!
<br>
Just ask your government. I wasn't judging the morality of it, just stating
<br>
that it is so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You continue, &quot;has invaded its neighbours,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ## Gee, and the Mexicans &amp; Canadians haven't said a single 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word about that.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where, when, &amp; what are you talking about Emlyn?  Are you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussing Germany 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the Second World War?  Are you talking about when we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made the drug 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bust in Panama?  Or are you discussing when we took the anti 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aircraft weapons 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from the construction workers in Grenada that were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threatening our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medical students?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe I am. I would also have included all of South America as neighbours of
<br>
the U.S., which may be overly broad of me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You continue again, &quot;is fairly experienced at trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control the world's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supply of oil,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ##Now you inserted enough modifiers in that sentence that it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is hard to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide if you really meant what you said or not.  
</em><br>
<p>Ok, I meant it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Like other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries the US 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has tried to bargain down the price of oil.  
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. I don't think that's wrong, particularly (oil? couldn't care less),
<br>
I'm just pointing it out in relation to the post I was originally replying
<br>
to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, what I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't get is this -- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are perceptive enough to notice all the things the evil 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rascally US has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done wrong and still you didn't notice that the US had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively occupied 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saudi Arabia during the First Gulf War.  Then when the reason 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for their being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invited there had been accomplished the US loaded up and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; departed.  Imagine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, they had the oil supply of Saudi Arabia right under 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their thumbs and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they gave it back without delay and without discussion?  Of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course a fact 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like that wouldn't make it through your &quot;selectometer&quot; would it?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I've pretty much stopped pretending to understand the motivations of
<br>
the U.S. government. That was pre-September 11, and before the current
<br>
administration. Plus, the Saudis are pretty well behaved vis-a-vis oil
<br>
supply, are they not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You continued yet again, &quot;and has used chemical weapons on at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least its own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troops and certainly on the citizens of other countries 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (think Vietnam).&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ##Yes, I remember going through gas mask training three times 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tenure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the Navy.  I imagine others had the same experience.  To 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince us that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we really were in tear gas they made us remove our masks; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; march to the front 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the room, recite name, rank and serial number; and then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; march out of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; room.  If you rushed at any point you had to go to the rear 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the line and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wait without a mask.  Stories have been repeated that to get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Viet Cong out of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tunnels the US used the same gases we use on criminals in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this country.  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidently thought we would be ever so much nicer if we had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of getting them to surrender.
</em><br>
<p>Well, maybe it is justifiable, that's all well and good. I wasn't debating
<br>
the justifiability, just pointing out the simple fact of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you wrote this, &quot;I'm sure other countries would fit that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bill, too. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; North Korea would probably fit rather well if it had oil, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is morally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent unless you propose that having power over some of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world's oil 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is somehow morally damning.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ##Emlyn, I don't know what you were trying to say in that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last little bit.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please take it back and rewrite it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ron h.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>OK, I'll type slower.
<br>
<p>John Clark had listed points about Iraq having and wanting WMD, controlling
<br>
world oil supply, using chemical weapons on its citizens and others, and
<br>
invading its neighbours, as justification for invading Iraq. My point is
<br>
that many countries, including the US, fulfil the same criteria. Even more
<br>
fulfil the criteria if you leave out the point about oil. I contend that if
<br>
the point about oil cannot be left out, it means the assertion is being made
<br>
that oil is a good reason for war.
<br>
<p>Note that none of this particular line of argument involved judging Iraq or
<br>
the U.S. or anyone else on the morality of these points, or required
<br>
establishing that the points were actually true wrt Iraq. I merely wish to
<br>
challenge these criteria as justifications for declaring war.
