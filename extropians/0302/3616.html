<p>I think the problem is not rigidity. The problem is that the SI is not
<br>
really an SI. It's not especially intelligent. It can be fooled by
<br>
unaugmented humans, and it doesn't seem capable of augmenting human
<br>
intelligence (the story doesn't explicitly say this, but it's implied
<br>
because nobody in the story asks for augmented intelligence or encounters
<br>
anyone with augmented intelligence). What kind of an SI would have
<br>
unintentionally almost allowed somebody to die from rabies?
<br>
<p>Maybe an interesting question to explore is, what if this is the higest
<br>
level of intelligence that our universe is capable of supporting? I think
<br>
this is also implied in the story, because nobody bothers to try to make
<br>
the AI smarter or invent a new AI architecture that is capable of greater
<br>
intelligence. The author seems to argue that in this case the best thing
<br>
we can do is to go back to being hunter-gatherers, and if this involves
<br>
murdering trillions of people, so be it. Surely we can do better than
<br>
that?
