<p>&quot;Such a cycle would have to process the high-level waste as fast as it 
<br>
produces it. Have you calculated this? What about the medium and low 
<br>
active wastes? &quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;And can we assure that this technology, power plants and such, will 
<br>
always be properly maintained and in the hand of responsible persons? 
<br>
There're dozens of nuclear driven ships and subs of the FSU rotting in 
<br>
their habors.&quot;
<br>
<p>Um, Kai, what about the 3 million people who die, every year, right now,
<br>
from atmospheric pollutants?  You talk on and on about potential this and
<br>
risk factor that, but what about the people dying, right now, 3 million of
<br>
them, every year?  Have you been factoring them into your risk assessments?
<br>
Youre talking about nuclear powers *potential* to kill thousands or millions
<br>
in a single catastrophic event.  *potential*.  What about the millions that
<br>
ARE dying, *right now* from fossil fuel combustion?  The thousands who die
<br>
from CO inhalation, natural gas explosions, coal mining accidents.  There
<br>
are 10's of thousands of miles of explosive natural gas lines cris crossing
<br>
dozens of nations.  Temperature increases from global warming could cause
<br>
millions of deaths in developing nations that are very dependant on existing
<br>
climates.  
<br>
<p>&quot;Until then, the remaining risks are too high for my personal measure of
<br>
safety. If that makes me an &quot;enviro-wacko&quot; in your eyes, I'll 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;return this with a friendly &quot;techno-loony&quot; :-)&quot;
<br>
<p>The fact that you readily condemn a technology because it has a *chance* of
<br>
killing thousands or millions as a replacement for one that is ALL READY
<br>
killing MILLIONS *every year* paints you as a 'enviro wacko' in my eyes
<br>
because you value your pre-concieved idealogies over the lives of human
<br>
beings.  Unless you dispute the claim that pollutants from fossil fuel
<br>
combustion cause this intollerable number of deaths, then the chance of
<br>
nuclear power causing similar numbers in individual incidents still far
<br>
outwieghs coal, as it is here now killing millions.  There is 100% chance it
<br>
will kill millions every year.
