<p>There has also been the suggestion that the veto powers opposed to
<br>
a US invasion of Iraq might in the end decide not to veto it in
<br>
order to save the credibility of the Security Council, i.e. Iraq
<br>
would not be considered worth sacrificing the UN.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wonder if there are some in the Bush administration who would rather see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Security Council totally discredited so that it can create a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Security Council from scratch. The fact that France, a medium-sized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country in Europe, has veto power doesn't really make sense to me,
</em><br>
<p>France has a bit of military reach and a lot of influence in Africa
<br>
due to its colonial past.  France has a mature nuke program.  The
<br>
land based missiles were dismantled after the Soviet threat
<br>
disappeared, but there are a couple of French SSBN's floating through
<br>
the oceans, and there are nukes launched from air craft that could
<br>
be deployed from bases or the Charles de Gaulle.  This may all look
<br>
very puny from the US perspective, but as seen from the p.o.v. of
<br>
the average country on this planet, it is formidable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does anyone have any ideas about how the Security Council might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be redesigned more rationally?
</em><br>
<p>With nuclear proliferation looking inevitable--after all it *is*
<br>
1940's technology--the old structure looks bound to collapse, but
<br>
I have no idea how to replace it.
