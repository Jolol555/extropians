<p>Thanks Mez: Think you're very right about this! I also think it's
<br>
unbelievable how little money has been put into reconstructing Russia,
<br>
considering how much was being put into the Cold War. Democracy there is a
<br>
little quivery and they still retain equal numbers of nuclear weapons.
<br>
<p>I think the lack of Marahall Plan is linked to the lack of support for
<br>
democracies worldwide. You can see this in Australia's attitude to SE Asia,
<br>
where democracies like Thailand and South Korea are rater lower than racist
<br>
pseudo-democracies like Malaysia or Fiji and recent autocracies with
<br>
blood-soaked genocidal generals still wandering around like Indonesia.
<br>
Australia has little notion of rewarding democracies and sticking together,
<br>
unless they are white and speak English (with the exception of Japan).
<br>
Instead Australia goes resources as the primary motivational factor. Even
<br>
with East Timor, I can remember our current Prime Minister in 1982 railing
<br>
in favour of Indonesia instead of the East Timorese - his conversion to
<br>
assisting East Timor coincides with forcing a better deal on it for oil - I
<br>
worked on the Timor Gap treaty for a bit in 1989 - so now Australia stands
<br>
to gain well over two-thirds of the oil [as opposed to its previous deal
<br>
with Indonesia, which was going to give it about half, and international
<br>
law, which says Australia should get nothing - but we withdrew from the
<br>
jurisdiction of the relevant international court in order to ignore
<br>
international law]. Thus Australia pays for its troops salaries (we didn't
<br>
expend any munitions) and takes back a hefty several-billions dollar profit.
<br>
East Timor's population is low (1 million) compared to Australia's (20
<br>
million), so their remaining billions (several) might seem fabulous anyhow,
<br>
but Australia is a continent and they are a tiny island - they will have to
<br>
wait for assemblers once that oil money goes, and it will barely be
<br>
sufficient to establish an infrastructure for them. In contrast, Australia
<br>
will use up it's billions on one single item of line expenditure.

<p><p><em>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:Dehede011@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Bush%20budget%20has%200%20dollars%20for%20Afghanistan">Dehede011@aol.com</a> [mailto:<a href="mailto:Dehede011@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Bush%20budget%20has%200%20dollars%20for%20Afghanistan">Dehede011@aol.com</a>]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then you really have to look at a bigger picture.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; going into Afghanistan saved us being hit a 2nd time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by the Al Qaeda what is the cost for that relative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the cost of going into Afghanistan?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The bigger pictures is exactly what I'm talking about.  I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complaining about the cost of going into Afghanistan.  Rather, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointing out the huge disparity between the steps the US is willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take to address problems in the short term (invading a country, taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out a current terrorist group) vs. addressing problems in the long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term (spreading democracy, stabilizing fragile areas, stamping out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global poverty, ignorance, and oppression).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that terrorism is more dangerous than individual terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can kill all the terrorists we want, but unless we go after some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the root causes of terrorism, it's pointless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conversely, so long as the US props up dictators who oppress their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; populace, the US is investing in future terrorism.  So it seems to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we're taking short-term action against terrorists at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time that we're promoting terrorism in the long term.  Not very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clever.
