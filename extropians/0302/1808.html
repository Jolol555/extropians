<em>&gt; The idea behind hydrogen as an intermediate fuel is to go from a

<p>I don't think that is the biggest advantage of a H based economy.
<br>
<p>With oil we are dependent on getting it out of the ground in those few 
<br>
locations where it is. And there is a limited amount. Thus there is 
<br>
limited growth.
<br>
<p>What is special about H is that it can be generated practically 
<br>
everywhere. The availability is only limited by human imagination! And 
<br>
as &gt;H's it should be obvious what that means. The possibility for 
<br>
exponential growth in enviromentally neutral energy.
<br>
<p>With the added side effect that we can gain independence if political 
<br>
dangerous regions.
<br>
<p>If we have a H economy it opens up all kinds of entrepeneural 
<br>
oportunities. It is trivially easy to generate H, even in the poorest of 
<br>
countries. Storage, use and handling is currently difficult.
<br>
<p>But what would be really important would be the effetc of a large market 
<br>
for H energy. If it is a big part of the economy, and the availability 
<br>
is only limited by human imagination, we should soon se all sorts of new 
<br>
ideas pop up. And development should speed up.
<br>
<p>Somebody who made it 10% more efficient to generate H would not make a 
<br>
lot of money on it these days, but with H powered cars and home fuel 
<br>
cells he would make a killing.
<br>
<p>A H powered economy has the potential for imense wealth, while an oil 
<br>
powered economy is slowly but shurely grinding towards a lack of resources.
<br>
<p>Besides, if we get advanced nanotech, the only real currency will 
<br>
probably be energy.
