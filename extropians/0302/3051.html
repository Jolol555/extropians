</em><br>
<p>Absurd? Is it possible that some extropes have become so fixated
<br>
on a desirable destination that they have completely abstracted
<br>
away the requirement for any journey to get there?
<br>
<p>A nearby dictionary yields the following: 
<br>
<p>Patriotism. n. devotion to one's own country and concern for
<br>
its defence. 
<br>
<p>Well, I don't know about 'devotion' to my country I guess that
<br>
depends a little on whether I consider my country as primarily a 
<br>
piece of real estate or as mainly an extended social group that I
<br>
already have connections to and that just happen to be Australians.
<br>
<p>As I've grown older my opportunity to know people other than 
<br>
Australians has increased and I am glad of that but I see nothing 
<br>
absurd or exclusive in retaining a high regard for family and existing 
<br>
friends.
<br>
<p>I think it would be a strange variety of transhumanism that required
<br>
me to demote my family and friends to the mere status of abstract
<br>
instances of personhood rather than take the other route and *extend*
<br>
my connections, understanding and regard to people of other countries.
<br>
<p>The term patriot is not a self descriptor that I am likely to adopt but in
<br>
2003, whilst patriotism may be getting slightly over-ripe I don't think 
<br>
its yet become absurd.  When I can apply for citizenship of Earth I'll be 
<br>
very keen to check that out.
<br>
<p>In the meantime I am a little disconcerted when very capable extropes
<br>
seem to want to start a journey of becoming by assuming we have
<br>
already arrived. Such assumptions *might* actually *delay* arrival. 
<br>
<p>Onward yes, but let's watch the step. There might be a lemming word
<br>
for onward.
