Arti querried:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;As far as I know, the anti-war protests I have been involved with are 
<br>
basically anti-DEATH and speaking out  against bullying tactics by my own #$%&amp;
<br>
@! government! Anti-American??? I THINK NOT!   Anti-current warmongering 
<br>
policy, YES.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>America going after hostiles is by definition, war-mongering to you. Since 
<br>
neither you, nor I will be shouldering a rifle in this comming jihad, this 
<br>
relegates us to email flames, I'm afraid.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;What *I* want as a protester is a government that does not DICTATE to its 
<br>
citizens and the world that it means to be &quot;the boss&quot;, and that it is always 
<br>
RIGHT! Our government needs to continuously work harder with the other 
<br>
countries of the world and come together to deal more effectively with people 
<br>
like Osama who perpetuate fear and death among us human beings. We need to 
<br>
learn to deal effectively with problems like these on a global scale, not 
<br>
unilaterally as &quot;King George II&quot; wants to do.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>You want our government and other governments to behave as you would wish 
<br>
them, and so do I, but the wishes of you and I are diamterically opposed. We 
<br>
need to Boss other nations around because of so many Americans have died, by 
<br>
&quot;acting respectfully&quot;, which in most parts is seen as weakness. 
<br>
<p>I believe the nations like France, Germany, Belgium, Mother Russia, China; as 
<br>
a very brief summary, would like to see the United States (and by definition 
<br>
its citzenry) contained, broken, and perhaps destroyed, respectively. Its not 
<br>
paranoia when it happens before our electronic eyes and ears, and 9-11 
<br>
happended, and the Euro denouncements of the US are happening.
<br>
<p>Let me say that when thousands perish in Sidney, vis a vi, a successful 
<br>
attack; the choice for Australia's citizens will be clearer then. This will 
<br>
be a digital choice I am suggesting; 0 or 1, war or withdrawl, yes or no. We 
<br>
may discuss that later if you'd like?
<br>
<p>George hasn't found Osama, this is true, but Europe and China are not &quot;hot 
<br>
nuts&quot; for entering Pakistan and routing out the bastard and his ISI 
<br>
supporters either. I voted for Gore, last election because I liked his ideas 
<br>
on energy, which were better than no ideas, which GB2 seemed to exemplify. I 
<br>
surely support Bush2 now as a antidote to the nihilsm and strident 
<br>
Chamberlinist mentality pervading the Left and the Liberals too.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The world will always be full of &quot;thugs&quot;, I just don't think that the 
<br>
United States should become one of them by threatening other countries with 
<br>
it's own WMD's FOR ANY REASON! Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a JUSTIFIED 
<br>
war with conventional high-tech weapons, for reasons such as if a country 
<br>
tries to forcibly take over its neighgbor or perpetuates &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; 
<br>
or whatever you want to call it.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ok you've decided then to wait until a 1st strike, and absorb the deaths, and 
<br>
then react after the fact, and the body count has been conducted. Very well. 
<br>
I vociferously disagree to having my fellow citizens lying dead in the 
<br>
streets by the thousands, so the protestors can feel themselves to be morally 
<br>
justified. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;As for the &quot;rogue entities&quot; (meaning terrorist groups etc.), if they REALLY 
<br>
want weapons, there will always be people out there willing to sell to them, 
<br>
that is unavoidable no matter how many countries are involved in the &quot;War 
<br>
against Terrorism&quot;. I can't think of any real effective way of controlling 
<br>
the uncontrollable, but I do think that increasing national security is a 
<br>
good thing as long as our civil liberties are still protected (which I 
<br>
definitely think they are not!).  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, possessing and obtaining such weapons is surely, possible. However, if 
<br>
there is a rolling military and political campaign, joined by many nations as 
<br>
it gains steam, and fiercely enforced by the CIA, then even the Russian Mafia 
<br>
might find it not worth the trouble. 100 million for a stolen nuke is not 
<br>
worth it if you and your compadres' can't spend the money in hell.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Can we please stop this madness from spreading?
<br>
<p>Arti&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The madness, as you state it, is not a one-sided coin. The madness is a 
<br>
profilgate European and North Korean hunger for cash, and prestige, and the 
<br>
willingness to sell to people who have the mentality of Koba the Bandit (aka 
<br>
Stalin), whom happens to be Saddam's beloved role model from his youth. The 
<br>
madness is a citizenry of those states, willing to coddle terrorist and 
<br>
jihadi nations (including the USA's coddling of the Saudi Royals) and the 
<br>
wondering why the snake turns around and bites us in the bum?  You want a 
<br>
world where people sensibly negotiate, and exchange ideas through analysis 
<br>
and resolve? Good, then remove dictatorships, and the governments which suck 
<br>
up to them. Because these dictatorships and their quisling lakeys are holding 
<br>
up the arrival of such a world state.
<br>
<p>Yours, in peace
<br>
<p>Mitch
