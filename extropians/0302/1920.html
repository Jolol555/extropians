<em>&gt; The Shuttle program,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in particular, is so focused on reusability that efficiency falls by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wayside.  (Okay, I'm ready for a certain rocket engineer to chime in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with &quot;you don't throw away a 747 everytime you fly it.&quot;  If the cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of maintaining the plane after one flight were more than building a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new, I would.  Throwaway Saturn Vs would probably be more efficient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and maybe even safer than the Shuttles.)
</em><br>
<p>A new space shuttle cost to build, back in the 1980s, 1-1.5 billion
<br>
dollars. I suspect the cost would be somewhere upwards of $4 billion
<br>
today. A single flight, turnaround and refurbishment of the shuttle and
<br>
its SRBs, plus replacing the main fuel tank, costs about $100 million.
<br>
<p>The Saturn - Apollo project cost $25 billion dollars (in 1966 dollars)
<br>
by the time they put the first two men on the moon, and this counted
<br>
the first several missions being only Saturn IB boosters, which could
<br>
only put 19,000 lbs or so into orbit. Counting by Apollo missions, each
<br>
mission cost $2.21 billion in 1966 dollars. Taking inflation into
<br>
account, and accounting for the fact that this is old technology with
<br>
less R&amp;D requirements, this would be in the order of $4 billion per
<br>
mission today. At this rate, we are getting 22 Shuttle missions for the
<br>
price of one Saturn 5 mission.
<br>
<p>The Saturn project could only boost a crew of 3 at a time, and could
<br>
not return cargo to earth (like recovered satellites).
<br>
<p>The Saturn V booster was also the very most complex machine ever built
<br>
by man. It has several times more moving parts than the Shuttle system,
<br>
and is thus a more risky vehicle by that very fact. In all, there were
<br>
I think 18 Saturn missions. Columbia alone flew 22 times before it's
<br>
breakup, yet it has a slightly better accident rate than all of the the
<br>
Saturn (recall that Apollo I killed its crew on the launch pad) rockets
<br>
combined.
<br>
<p>An entire R&amp;D project would have to be undertaken to develop less
<br>
complex systems, thus more money...
<br>
<p>I might also point out that the Saturn's main booster burns methane,
<br>
not hydrogen, so the opposition of the environmental groups would be higher.
