</em><br>
<p>Actually, it is the UN and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which
<br>
tells Iraq and North Korea what weapons they can and cannot posess.
<br>
<p>Like North Korea, Iraq is trying to make the whole issue look like it
<br>
is being bullied by the US, when we are simply enforcing UN resolutions
<br>
that date back to 1990, and to the cease fire agreement that Saddam
<br>
signed in 1991 WITH THE UN. It is not our fault if some countries are
<br>
moral cowards and are sabotaging the effectiveness of the UN for their
<br>
own commercial enrichment (i.e. France, Germany, and Russia in their
<br>
business relations with Saddam).
<br>
<p>It is not we who are throwing our weight around, it is France and
<br>
Germany that are doing so, trying to establish an imperial europe under
<br>
their rule that has one rule: oppose or sabotage the US in any way
<br>
possible and make a buck however they can. It is France and Germany who
<br>
are throwing their weight around and destroying the international
<br>
system for their own profit. They claim it is about oil, and they are
<br>
right, oil that they want to keep for themselves and for their own
<br>
profit, at prices that will continue to lavishly finance their social
<br>
welfare states.
