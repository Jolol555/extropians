<p>
I hope this helps to satisfy some of the questions which have come up.
<br>
<p>(the following paragraphs are from a friend in Houston and contain bits from
<br>
several emails)
<br>
The day after Columbia's launch, engineers reviewed videotapes of the
<br>
shuttle's ascent and spotted the foam breaking off. An engineering analysis
<br>
developed during the flight, based on similar incidents in the past,
<br>
suggested that the foam could have damaged tiles on the left wing. Mission
<br>
managers judged that such damage would not pose a serious risk.
<br>
<p>NASA says Columbia didn't have the equipment to dock with the space station.
<br>
In addition, Columbia was flying in an orbit that was about 100 miles (160
<br>
kilometers) lower than the station, with a different orbital inclination (39
<br>
degrees vs. 51 degrees for the space station). The shuttle was not carrying
<br>
enough fuel to make what would have been a tortuous journey to the station.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for shuttle missions that are designed to include a space
<br>
station stopover, the orbital mechanics are so precise that the launch
<br>
window is limited to five minutes or less. For these reasons, it would have
<br>
been virtually impossible for the shuttle to get to the space station.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it were possible, it would be difficult to construct a
<br>
scenario for an in-orbit repair operation or a rescue. If NASA knew there
<br>
was a problem, Columbia could have stayed in orbit for an extra few days -
<br>
perhaps long enough for the emergency launch of another shuttle, Atlantis.
<br>
In a series of spacewalks, Columbia's crew members could have been
<br>
transferred over to the other shuttle. The operation would have required
<br>
NASA to throw out its rule book, involving extraordinary risks.
<br>
It's questionable whether the crew or anyone on the ground could have gotten
<br>
a direct view of the tile damage. Since Columbia was not being used for
<br>
spacewalks for this mission, the robot arm was not aboard the shuttle this
<br>
time around. A camera mounted on the robot arm might have been beneficial
<br>
for doing an inspection; a spacewalk would have been far riskier and less
<br>
useful.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the shuttle's astronauts, Michael Anderson and David Brown,
<br>
had been trained to do an emergency spacewalk if necessary - and their EVA
<br>
suits were aboard Columbia. But they had no equipment or safe procedure for
<br>
inspecting the tiles beneath the wing for damage.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, NASA has used military satellite imagery to look for
<br>
damage to the shuttle's tiles, but shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore
<br>
said the images &quot;were not very useful to us.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if tile damage had been detected, Dittemore said, &quot;we couldn't
<br>
do anything about it.&quot; In the early years of the shuttle program, NASA had
<br>
looked into developing a tile-patching kit that was basically a caulking
<br>
gun. But the gunk undermined the performance of the tiles and never flew.
<br>
The piece of foam came off the tank about 80 seconds after launch. If NASA
<br>
mission managers had spotted the potential problem in real time and
<br>
determined that it posed an unacceptable risk, they would have had several
<br>
options for aborting Columbia's flight.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first two and a half minutes after launch, the shuttle would
<br>
have returned to a Kennedy Space Center landing strip or a backup strip
<br>
along North America's east coast. After that, the shuttle would have had
<br>
another two and a half minutes to head for a landing at emergency runways in
<br>
Spain, Morocco or Gambia. There are also emergency procedures for putting
<br>
the shuttle into a lower-than-normal orbit.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's important to remember, however, that NASA did not regard the
<br>
foam break-off as a mission-ending emergency - even when it was spotted
<br>
after the fact.
<br>
<p>The only alternative would have been to bring the orbiter in at a different
<br>
angle of decent. Since the optimum decent is the one normally chosen, (for
<br>
the amount of heat and preservation of the shuttle), changing the decent
<br>
pattern might have saved the shuttle crew, but likely would have caused
<br>
major structural damage to the orbiter rendering it useless for future
<br>
missions, though permitting it to land. A long shot, but it was his only
<br>
suggestion.
<br>
<p>Obviously this would have been a choice of last resort, and might have
<br>
changed the tragic results. But this is assuming one knew that there was a
<br>
major flaw on the left side of the orbiter. But who knows what is what at
<br>
this point.
<br>
<p>Temperature readings jumped 60 degrees on the left side as opposed to 15
<br>
degrees on the right side. It appears the orbiter was experiencing some sort
<br>
of drag on the left side and the computers on board were struggling to level
<br>
the shuttle just prior to the disaster. Apparently there is 32 seconds of
<br>
computer data that was received after voice contact was lost, but it will
<br>
have to be uncoded by hand as it is garbled data, but hopefully it will
<br>
provide some further insight into those final moments.
<br>
<p>(end)
<br>
<p>Quarterbacking after the game is always an attractive past time, with many
<br>
people saying they should have done this or they knew about that. It is
<br>
however a useless endeavor and we all know that the rest of the astronauts
<br>
will climb on board the next flight knowing the risks. Is that the
<br>
definition of a hero, one who knows the risk and takes it not out of glory
<br>
but because it is their job? If it is there are a lot more heroes out there
<br>
than we give credit to. We do give thanks to many more of them today than we
<br>
did a few short years ago. We celebrate the heroism of our firemen and
<br>
police after 9/11 than we did previous to that day. We hold out armed
<br>
servicemen in higher regard today than we did just a few short years ago. We
<br>
still don't pay any of them what they are worth, nor the teachers in our
<br>
schools.
<br>
<p>The military astronauts loose their separate rations pay while on board,
<br>
they do however receive flight pay. Is it still an additional $50 a month?
<br>
<p>Has anyone else caught any of the CNN bloopers on the shuttle disaster. My
<br>
favorite was when they announced the shuttle was traveling at 15 times the
<br>
speed of light. I don't know who it was that first said something like the
<br>
following. science is good. Journalism is good. Put them together and
<br>
nothing good comes of it.
<br>
<p>Several of the people I have been exchanging emails with live in or near the
<br>
Johnson Space Center or Kennedy Space port many of them were friends or
<br>
worked with these fine folks and will miss them all.
<br>
<p>Keep 'em Flying
<br>
I really mean it...
