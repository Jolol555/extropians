<p>### Can you quantify the risk you are exposed to, if large amounts of
<br>
highly-radioactive waste are stored in a geologically stable underground
<br>
repository, in the form of vitrified, metal-encased logs?
<br>
<p>If you were to follow the calculations of nuclear engineers, the only
<br>
persons competent to make them, such danger to you would be probably less
<br>
than the danger of being killed by an asteroid.
<br>
<p>I hope that you would not opt to use the political process (rather than a
<br>
rational assessment of risks) to stop the engineers from doing their jobs,
<br>
that is, providing cheap and safe energy.
