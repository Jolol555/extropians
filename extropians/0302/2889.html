Moreover, even the Marshall plan did not get announced as policy until 1948. 
<br>
Policy doesn't run like a time piece, no matter what the rest if the world 
<br>
expects of us. 
<br>
<p>Ron h noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;They have a pipeline under development that is 
<br>
supposed to generate trillions of dollars of revenue so one might reasonably 
<br>
ask at what point the US is relieved of the necessity to do for the Aghani 
<br>
what they can easily do for themselves.
<br>
       Naturally the average person on this list does not get a daily report 
<br>
on expenditures inside Afghanistan so it is easy to come in here and feed us 
<br>
a cock &amp; bull story.  We are at war and from long experience we know we face 
<br>
at least two kinds of predators.  There are those on the other side that 
<br>
carry guns and attempt to kill us.  There are those within our own country 
<br>
that try to smooth the way for those with guns.
<br>
