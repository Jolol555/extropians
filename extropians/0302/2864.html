<br>
the german online magazine Telepolis[1] about an anti-war demonstration in 
<br>
New York on Saturday. They say the police built barricades, hindered 
<br>
demonstrants to reach the place of the event, beat up people and used almost 
<br>
every non-democratic way to keep this demonstration small. Nevertheless, 
<br>
First to Fifth Avenue were crowded with people. Seems that slowly, slowly, 
<br>
the US authorities really drift from &quot;freedom and democracy&quot; towards banana 
<br>
republic.
<br>
<p>Kai,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That article sounds strongly of fish.  It fits too well with what we 
<br>
know of German policy and doesn't fit well enough with what we saw happen 
<br>
over here.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sort of thing has happened before.  I was working in Chicago at 
<br>
the time of the 1968 riots.  I crossed the Loop twice a day.  The national 
<br>
media gave a very distorted view of what I saw personally.
