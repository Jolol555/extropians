<p><em>&gt; Yes, it's just like those awful anti-nuclear marches. All the so-called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;peace&quot; demonstrators---whose main effect was to increase the likelihood of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war--helped by their protests (which were greeted in the streets of Moscow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the greatest elation) to bring about the ruinous exchange in 1989 when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Soviet Union nuked the USA and vice versa.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh no, wait.
</em><br>
<p>I understand your sarcasm, and do grant the point that
<br>
you are trying to make.  Indeed, the peace protests in
<br>
the U.S. in the 1980's helped permit Soviet leaders to
<br>
take more chances---but this was perhaps not so great
<br>
an effect as that they evidently trusted Reagan and
<br>
Bush not to take advantage of their dissolution.
<br>
Still, you are entirely correct that the demonstrations
<br>
themselves had a salutary outcome.
<br>
<p>At least in this universe.  Recall the high chance that
<br>
some Soviet generals were not going to put up with an
<br>
end to their Soviet Union.  Signs of weakness in the
<br>
West motivated them to take a strong line.  Had we
<br>
someone besides Reagan/Bush, it raises the probability
<br>
that the Soviet hard-liners could have convinced the 
<br>
others that conquest of Western Europe was one way out
<br>
of the mess.
<br>
<p>But I find it interesting and significant that you 
<br>
didn't lay a glove on *my* points:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The news [of western protests] is greeted with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greatest elation by the government and Mr. Hussein.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we can expect that any thoughts Saddam Hussein has of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; abdicating or to destroying his WMD are put on hold.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He'll naturally grasp at whatever straws are offered,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and all the so-called &quot;peace&quot; demonstrators---whose main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effect is to increase the likelihood of war...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [Vietnam protesters significantly aided what proved to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be a murderous regime.]
</em><br>
<p>I failed to mention his alternative hope that NATO
<br>
discord can save him.  France and Germany are acting
<br>
in a most uncooperatively.  France's motive is apparently
<br>
financial (Saddam owes them so many billions), but I
<br>
guess that Schroeder is just reflecting public opinion,
<br>
and seems to have a better reputation than Chirac.
