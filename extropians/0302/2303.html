<em>&gt;&gt; The last I heard Michael Jackson had a net worth of several hundred
</em><br>
million dollars. Not to say that could not evaporate through business
<br>
dealings. However, even if he has total control over say 100,000,000$ to
<br>
spend on the sole purpose of keeping himself youthful, and functionally
<br>
conscious for  an indeterminate  period of time in excess of 200 years
<br>
that is akin to a manhatten project to fight aging.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;====
<br>
<p>I have read that Michael Jackson was on the verge of bankruptcy due to
<br>
the large burn rate or the Neverland ranch upkeep.  He's playing zoo
<br>
tycoon and theme park tycoon with real money and he's the only paying
<br>
customer.  Sure there's enough money for a hyperbaric chamber and some
<br>
experimental pharmaceuticals but I've yet to hear of any medical
<br>
research funded by his wealth like the Bill and Melisa Gates foundation.
<br>
While Bill is not publicly pushing the life-extension agenda at this
<br>
point.  You can bet with the existing infrastructure the foundation is
<br>
building that he will bring resources to bear on aging as he gets older.

<br>
<p>That kind of commitment is far above what all of Bill Gates 50 plus
<br>
billion has committed so far.  I know it is comparing apples and oranges
<br>
but I still have to think it is more efficient to watch as one person
<br>
does whatever it takes than to watch another invest in a long tedious
<br>
march.
<br>
<p>Better yet turn them both loose and wish them both  success.
