From July 2002, RMIT [tertiary institution]
<br>
<p>Victoria, Australia is working towards nanotech.
<br>
<p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p>RMIT University is among the recipients of science technology and innovation grants awarded by the State Government. 
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>Nanotechnology Victoria: 
<br>
<p><p>The State Government will invest $12M in nanotechnology - the study, manufacture and use of new functional materials atom by atom, which promises to revolutionise the fields of medical science, information and communications technology and advanced manufacturing. 
<br>
<p><p>Nanotechnology will impact on all industry sectors and technologies and has the potential to deliver: 
<br>
<p>· smarter, less toxic drugs to combat diseases such as cancer; 
<br>
<p>· a new generation of high-speed computers and telecommunications systems; 
<br>
<p>· lightweight, high strength materials for use in advanced manufacturing. 
<br>
<p><p>With fierce competition from interstate and overseas the establishment of Nanotechnology Victoria couldn't have come at better time. The $30M ($12M state contribution) Nanotechnology Victoria consortium, which includes RMIT University, will ensure that Victoria is well placed to exploit the benefits this new technology has to offer. It is expected that within five years expenditure on Nanotechnology R&amp;D in Victoria will exceed $125M a year. 
<br>
<p><p>The development of Nanotechnology capability is critical to underpinning Victoria's strengths in medical science, ICT and advanced manufacturing.
