<p>
The extro related issue here is: how does one cut through the posturing
<br>
/on all sides/ of important questions, rather than be sucked in by them
<br>
along with the hoi polloi?
<br>
<p>Suggestion/homework:
<br>
Note carefully the final paragraph. Ponder it, if you will. Or if you
<br>
can't, notice that fact.
<br>
<p>Full disclosure on my part:
<br>
I put a USA flag on my car after 9/11. I also have an Amnesty International
<br>
sticker on it (two, actually, as the first one has faded). Part of me was
<br>
doing what the lingerie shop owner did. But I'm proud of both affilations,
<br>
too--even though I disagree with some policies of both, as far as I grok them.
<br>
<p>Go figure.

<br>
<p>Ah, Those Principled Europeans
<br>
<p>By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN
<br>
<p>BRUSSELS -- Last week I went to lunch at the Hotel Schweizerhof in Davos,
<br>
Switzerland, and discovered why America and Europe are at odds. At the
<br>
bottom of the lunch menu was a list of the countries that the lamb, beef and
<br>
chicken came from. But next to the meat imported from the U.S. was a tiny
<br>
asterisk, which warned that it might contain genetically modified organisms
<br>
‹ G.M.O.'s.
<br>
<p>My initial patriotic instinct was to order the U.S. beef and ask for it
<br>
&quot;tartare,&quot; just for spite. But then I and my lunch guest just looked at each
<br>
other and had a good laugh. How quaint! we said. Europeans, out of some
<br>
romantic rebellion against America and high technology, were shunning
<br>
U.S.-grown food containing G.M.O.'s ‹ even though there is no scientific
<br>
evidence that these are harmful. But practically everywhere we went in
<br>
Davos, Europeans were smoking cigarettes ‹ with their meals, coffee or
<br>
conversation ‹ even though there is indisputable scientific evidence that
<br>
smoking can kill you. In fact, I got enough secondhand smoke just dining in
<br>
Europe last week to make me want to have a chest X-ray.
<br>
<p>So pardon me if I don't take seriously all the Euro-whining about the Bush
<br>
policies toward Iraq ‹ for one very simple reason: It strikes me as deeply
<br>
unserious. It's not that there are no serious arguments to be made against
<br>
war in Iraq. There are plenty. It's just that so much of what one hears
<br>
coming from German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and French President Jacques
<br>
Chirac are not serious arguments. They are station identification.
<br>
<p>They are not the arguments of people who have really gotten beyond the
<br>
distorted Arab press and tapped into what young Arabs are saying about their
<br>
aspirations for democracy and how much they blame Saddam Hussein and his ilk
<br>
for the poor state of their region. Rather, they are the diplomatic
<br>
equivalent of smoking cancerous cigarettes while rejecting harmless G.M.O.'s
<br>
‹ an assertion of identity by trying to be whatever the Americans are not,
<br>
regardless of the real interests or stakes.
<br>
<p>And where this comes from, alas, is weakness. Being weak after being
<br>
powerful is a terrible thing. It can make you stupid. It can make you reject
<br>
U.S. policies simply to differentiate yourself from the world's only
<br>
superpower. Or, in the case of Mr. Chirac, it can even prompt you to invite
<br>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe ‹ a terrible tyrant ‹ to visit Paris just
<br>
to spite Tony Blair. Ah, those principled French.
<br>
<p>&quot;Power corrupts, but so does weakness,&quot; said Josef Joffe, editor of
<br>
Germany's Die Zeit newspaper. &quot;And absolute weakness corrupts absolutely. We
<br>
are now living through the most critical watershed of the postwar period,
<br>
with enormous moral and strategic issues at stake, and the only answer many
<br>
Europeans offer is to constrain and contain American power. So by default
<br>
they end up on the side of Saddam, in an intellectually corrupt position.&quot;
<br>
<p>The more one sees of this, the more one is convinced that the historian
<br>
Robert Kagan, in his very smart new book &quot;Of Paradise and Power,&quot; is right:
<br>
&quot;Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus.&quot; There is now a
<br>
structural gap between America and Europe, which derives from the yawning
<br>
power gap, and this produces all sorts of resentments, insecurities and
<br>
diverging attitudes as to what constitutes the legitimate exercise of force.
<br>
<p>I can live with this difference. But Europe's cynicism and insecurity,
<br>
masquerading as moral superiority, is insufferable. Each year at the Davos
<br>
economic forum protesters are allowed to march through the north end of
<br>
town, where last year they broke shop windows. So this year, on
<br>
demonstration day, all the shopkeepers on that end of town closed. But when
<br>
I walked by their shops in the morning, I noticed that three of them had put
<br>
up signs in their windows that said, &quot;U.S.A. No War in Iraq.&quot;
<br>
<p>I wondered to myself: Why did the shopkeepers at the lingerie store suddenly
<br>
decide to express their antiwar sentiments? Well, the demonstrators came and
<br>
left without getting near these shops. And guess what? As soon as they were
<br>
gone, the antiwar signs disappeared. They had been put up simply as window
<br>
insurance ‹ to placate the demonstrators so they wouldn't throw stones at
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>As I said, there are serious arguments against the war in Iraq, but they
<br>
have weight only if they are made out of conviction, not out of expedience
<br>
or petulance ‹ and if they are made by people with real beliefs, not
<br>
identity crises.
