<p>[...] If we had built — they didn't need developing because NASA Ames had
<br>
already developed them, although NASA Houston killed the program — real
<br>
space suits, we would also have provided means for using them, including
<br>
some shuttle tile material and some super glue, tether lines, and
<br>
instructions in repair procedures; but because we have never had decent
<br>
suits, NASA preferred not to know about damage on takeoff. Me, I'd like to
<br>
know: at least there's a chance to say goodbye. And there's always a chance
<br>
that human ingenuity will come up with a miracle, as was done with Apollo
<br>
13. Not a high chance, but some of us would prefer to go out trying. Given
<br>
the size of the chunk that hit Columbia on takeoff there's a high
<br>
probability that inspection would have shown there was no chance of
<br>
surviving re-entry. That would leave rescue by Atlantis, a race against
<br>
time. Or a decision to go in, knowing there wasn't much chance. Or a search
<br>
for something else. But at least they'd know. [etc]
