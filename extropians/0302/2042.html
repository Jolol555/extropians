<p>Hamza: 'Disaster was sign from God'
<br>
19.17PM GMT, 3 Feb 2003
<br>
Controversial Muslim cleric Abu Hamza has said that the Columbia shuttle
<br>
disaster was a &quot;Trinity of Evil&quot; punished with death by Allah.
<br>
<p>The outspoken cleric, who until recently preached at Finsbury Park mosque in
<br>
north London, made the claim because the Columbia carried Americans, an
<br>
Israeli Jew and an Indian-born Hindu - and it blew up over an area called
<br>
Palestine.
<br>
<p>The cleric is now banned from preaching at the mosque because of his
<br>
inflammatory sermons.
<br>
<p>He said British Muslims would take the shuttle disaster as a &quot;sign from God&quot;
<br>
that the first Israeli in space was killed over an area of Texas called
<br>
Palestine.
<br>
<p>He added: &quot;The Muslim people see these pilots as criminals. By going into
<br>
space they would have sharpened the accuracy of their bombs through
<br>
satellites.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;These missions would increase the number of satellites for military
<br>
purposes. It would increase the slavery of governance of other countries by
<br>
America.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It is a punishment from God.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Muslims see it that way. It is a trinity of evil because it carried
<br>
Americans, an Israeli and a Hindu, a trinity of evil against Islam.
<br>
<p>&quot;The fact that the motor of the craft fell on Palestine - all these are
<br>
messages from God.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It is a strong message, for the Israeli, to be taken up there to space and
<br>
he spoke about the Holocaust, to try to make religious advancement from it
<br>
and gain some moral high ground, hence you have seen this message over
<br>
Palestine.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr Hamza, originally from Egypt, has been roundly criticised for his radical
<br>
views, and has been disowned by the Muslim community in Britain.
<br>
<p>However, Anjem Choudray, UK leader of Al-Muhajiroun, the radical group which
<br>
wants to turn Britain into an Islamic country, said Muslims &quot;would not be
<br>
shedding any tears&quot; over the accident which claimed seven lives.
<br>
<p>Mr Choudray, from Ilford, east London, said the Muslim community in the UK
<br>
believed the disaster was evidence of the work of God.
<br>
<p>&quot;We believe if anyone innocent dies, then that is something we would not
<br>
wish on anyone.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;However, this craft did also have one Israeli army official on board.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Especially at this time, Muslims would not be shedding any tears.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Ultimately the US is a country at war with all Muslims and we know it is a
<br>
sign from God.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;This is the reaction I have heard from the Muslim community in Britain,
<br>
that it is a sign from God. However sophisticated the technology, ultimately
<br>
life and death is in God's hands.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr Choudray said he makes a distinction between &quot;ordinary&quot; Britons and
<br>
Americans - who he invites to join Islam and live under Sharia law - and
<br>
those involved in war.
<br>
<p>But he said the US space programme was part of the country's military
<br>
complex.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is linked to the military. These people would be linked to satellite
<br>
systems spying on Muslims and using the same technology to bomb Muslims and
<br>
ultimately to commit mass murder in Iraq.&quot;
<br>
<p>All seven crew of the American space shuttle were killed when the craft
<br>
disintegrated just minutes before it was scheduled to land at Cape
<br>
Canaveral, Florida.
