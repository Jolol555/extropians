I would support a US invasion of Iraq if I thought the US was
<br>
committed to sticking around in that country for the decades necessary
<br>
to build a working, healthy democracy.  The Bush Administration has
<br>
held Afghanistan up as an example of their commitment to rebuild after
<br>
a war.  Those who've followed the news know the the US has actually
<br>
done incredibly little to help rebuild Afghanistan, making this
<br>
example a source of doubt about US behavior in post-war Iraq.  Now
<br>
comes even more evidence:  Bush's proposed budget to congress for 2004
<br>
contains 0 dollars in spending to help rebuild Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>From the blog of John Marshall:
<br>
<p>---------------------------
<br>
<p><a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/feb0302.html#0214031253am">http://talkingpointsmemo.com/feb0302.html#0214031253am</a>
<br>
<p>Remember that place Afghanistan? You know, we had some guys 
<br>
over there. And they wear funny hats and, like, Osama bin Laden had 
<br>
a vacation home there or something ... 
<br>
<p>This would seem rather to sum up how much the folks at the Bush 
<br>
White House remember about the place. Apparently when the 
<br>
budgeteers on the Hill started working their way through the 
<br>
president's new budget they discovered there was no money, not even 
<br>
a line item, for humanitarian or reconstruction funds for Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>Remember, that was the place we weren't going to leave behind and 
<br>
so forth. 
<br>
<p>Now at first I thought maybe this was a case where the money is in 
<br>
there but just not labeled as being for Afghanistan or something like 
<br>
that. But that really doesn't seem to be the case. Congress has had to
<br>
<p>go back and stick in $300 million. According to this report from the 
<br>
BBC ( <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2759789.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2759789.stm</a> )... 
<br>
<p>The chairman of the committee that distributes foreign aid, Jim Kolbe,
<br>
<p>says that when he asked administration officials why they had not 
<br>
requested any funds, he was given no satisfactory explanation, but did
<br>
<p>get a pledge that it would not happen again. 
<br>
<p>Jim Kolbe is a Republican, or course. So it's really not clear to me 
<br>
what interest he would have in making the folks at the White House 
<br>
sound like such goofs. I think you have to figure that it's as big a 
<br>
screw-up as it looks like. 
<br>
<p>The BBC report also says that Afghan President Hamid Karzai is going 
<br>
to be in town this month looking for aid. We'll see how he manages. 
<br>
What's really telling isn't the lack of money so much as the fact that
<br>
<p>Karzai and his people didn't even get a mention. They didn't even
<br>
merit 
<br>
the standard smoke and mirrors treatment! The ultimate indignity ...
