<p>
Several people have mentioned the novel The Golden Age, by John C. Wright.
<br>
I read this a couple of months ago and am re-reading it now.  It's a
<br>
terrific novel and I'm enjoying it even more the second time through,
<br>
as I see more clearly how Wright's future society works and has evolved.
<br>
<p>According to the TOR Books web site, the sequel, The Phoenix Exultant,
<br>
will be published in April, which is also when The Golden Age should
<br>
appear in paperback.  I did see a claim online that the second book got
<br>
too long and the series will now be a trilogy.
<br>
<p>Damien pointed last year to this interview with the author, a colorful
<br>
and curmudgeonly sort (warning, contains some spoilers):
<br>
<a href="http://www.sfsite.com/05a/jcw127.htm">http://www.sfsite.com/05a/jcw127.htm</a>.
<br>
<p>What I like best about the book is the variety shown in Wright's future
<br>
society, the Golden Oecumene (oecumene means world in greek/roman).
<br>
The big problem in any non-fantasy future story these days is how to
<br>
handle super-intelligence.  We can't appreciate a story in which there
<br>
are nothing but super-human beings.  So we have to focus on possible
<br>
futures in which there are some recognizable humans.  Then you need to
<br>
explain why these people still exist given the existence of superhumans.
<br>
<p>Basically what Wright has done is to show a possible variant on
<br>
Eliezer's &quot;Friendly AI&quot; scenario.  Humanity is shepherded and guarded by
<br>
super-intelligent AIs, the Sophotechs.  These beings take a relatively
<br>
passive role in human society, primarily acting as guides and aides.
<br>
They give advice, they run the virtual and augmented realities;
<br>
occasionally they invent things.  But what they also do, although it's
<br>
not depicted directly in the story, is prevent violence.  No one can
<br>
hurt or physically coerce anyone else.
<br>
<p>In short, the Golden Oecumene is a libertarian utopia.  It used to be
<br>
that when you joined the Libertarian Party you had to sign this little
<br>
card saying something like &quot;I promise not to use coercion on anyone else.&quot;
<br>
In the Golden Oecumene, this is the primary law.  No one can be coerced.
<br>
Everyone has complete freedom as long as they don't harm anyone but
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>What we see in the novel is the working-out of this principle as applied
<br>
to a world in which alterations to the mind and its perceptions can
<br>
be achieved almost without limit.  In fact this is to some extent a
<br>
&quot;travelogue&quot; novel, meaning one whose interest flows from the setting and
<br>
scenery more than the plot.  But in this case, the tour is of mentality
<br>
rather than of physical space.
<br>
<p>We've got the space elevator, terraformed planets, massive engineering
<br>
projects, but they aren't that interesting.  Where Wright is dazzling is
<br>
in presenting the range of human mental (and to some extent, physical)
<br>
adaptations and variations.  There are half a dozen different mental
<br>
organizations which are described in considerable detail: the Vulcan-
<br>
like Invariants; the Warlocks, who walk through a waking dream; the
<br>
Compositions, group minds; the Sophotechs, the super-intelligent AIs; the
<br>
Neptunians, who have rejected the Oecumenical principles of non-coercion
<br>
and whose super-cold organic brains approach Sophotech powers; and more.
<br>
<p>Add to this the capability of individuals to alter their brains,
<br>
their motivations and perceptions, as easily as we change our clothes.
<br>
It's a tremendous power, but extremely dangerous.  A single rash act
<br>
can put you on the path to mental self-destruction; and there can be
<br>
no intervention, nothing stronger than verbal persuasion is allowed
<br>
to try to rescue someone who has made such a mistake.  We see several
<br>
cases where good, strong people have destroyed themselves in this way.
<br>
The ultimate freedom is the freedom to be wrong.
<br>
<p>It's a good, philosophical book that faces these issues squarely.  As in
<br>
any real utopia, a substantial part of the population hates their society.
<br>
We hear their voices as well.  What meaning is there for life in a world
<br>
where anything a human can do, a machine can do better?  It's a tough
<br>
problem but it's one our descendants (and perhaps even we ourselves)
<br>
may have to deal with.
<br>
<p>Several reviewers have complained about the style.  It's a little rough
<br>
and old-fashioned, but I enjoyed it.  There are several hilariously
<br>
funny scenes that help to puncture some of the pomposity.  Also, on
<br>
re-reading the book it is clear that the main action of the story is
<br>
actually a distraction which is covering up the important event that is
<br>
really happening, which will presumably be the topic of the next book(s).
<br>
<p>It's interesting to compare Wright's society with Banks' Culture.
<br>
Both have augmented humans side-by-side with super-intelligent AIs.
<br>
The Culture is a socialist/communist utopia while the Golden Oecumene
<br>
is a libertarian one.  Both societies are fundamentally decadent by our
<br>
standards; both have strong threads of internal discontent.  I thought
<br>
in particular of Banks' recent Look to Windward as a good comparison
<br>
for The Golden Age.
<br>
<p>I'll wrap this up with some notes that might be of interest to others
<br>
who have read the book.  I've been going through and working out Wright's
<br>
chronology, the history of the Golden Oecumene, as I re-read the novel.
<br>
He leaks out bits and pieces here and there, and by playing detective I
<br>
have come up with a relatively coherent picture.  I haven't finished my
<br>
second run-through but here is how I see things so far.  I'll put in some
<br>
spoiler space for the benefit of those who haven't yet read the novel.

<p><p>Wright's characters describe history in terms of eras called Mental
<br>
Structures.  They are presently in the Seventh Mental Structure, aka
<br>
the Golden Oecumene (&quot;golden age&quot;).  Here is my reconstruction of the
<br>
earlier eras and their defining events:
<br>
<p>First Mental Structure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primitive hunter-gatherers.
<br>
Second Mental Structure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age of agriculture.
<br>
Third Mental Structure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Revolution.	We are in the late Third Mental Structure.
<br>
Fourth Mental Structure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to most of today's expectations, the Fourth Mental
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structure is not about AIs.  Rather, it is the age of the group
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minds.	It started with the First-Harmony Composition, whose
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waking to self-awareness defined the beginning of the Fourth
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental Structure.  During this era, individual consciousness
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;almost died out.  The Compositions offered a form of immortality,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as minds who joined were remembered forever.  The Fourth Mental
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structure was an eons-long era of peace.  It was during this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time that at least some of the new neuroforms were developed,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particularly the Warlock and probably the Invariant.
<br>
Fifth Mental Structure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fifth Mental Structure was a long period of chaos, beginning
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the Bellipotent Corporation re-invented murder and war.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bellipotents apparently engaged in warfare against Warlocks
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rapid advances in personal weaponry ensued.  It was during
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this era that the Eleemosynary Composition was founded which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;became one of the greatest and most powerful group minds.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ruled at least all of Asia and possibly the whole world.
<br>
Sixth Mental Structure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sixth Mental Structure was defined by the dawning of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine minds, the Sophotechs.	The Eleemosynary Composition
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;played an important part in the development of this AI technology.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The age of warfare was over as the Sophotechs imposed their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;benevolent rule on humans, forbidding violence.
<br>
Seventh Mental Structure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seventh Mental Structure dates from the development of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noumenal recording technology, which at last allowed true,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individual immortality.  The power of the group minds went into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decline as people preferred the idea of not dying over being
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well remembered.  This defines the current political/mental
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;configuration of the Golden Oecumene.  There are some indications
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the story occurs approximately 10000 years after the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beginning of this era.
