<p>Nanotechnology could save the ozone layer. Whilst experimenting with
<br>
nanospheres and perfluorodecalin, a liquid used in the production of
<br>
synthetic blood, researchers at Germany's University of Ulm have stumbled
<br>
across a phenomenon that could ultimately help remove ozone-harming
<br>
chemicals from the atmosphere. The perfluorodecalin, against all
<br>
expectations, was taken up by a water-based suspension of 60 nm diameter
<br>
polystyrene particles. (nanotechweb 1/30/03)

<p>Twenty Years until Anti-aging Nanotech: Zyvex Head. Stick around 20 years
<br>
and you could live to see medical nanotechnology battle aging, says the head
<br>
of a company that's making it happen. &quot;I think nanomedicine has such promise
<br>
for humanity that I have taken a small portion of my net worth and hired Rob
<br>
to write a book and to give us some ideas about what might be possible,&quot;
<br>
Texan millionaire Jim Von Her said in Wellington, New Zealand, while
<br>
attending a nanotechnology conference. &quot;We can't build any of the devices he
<br>
has designed yet because we don't have atomic precision. But in 20 years we
<br>
are going to be able to make little devices to go in your body and actually
<br>
fight diseases and cure some of the aging problems in cells. &quot;The &quot;Rob&quot; Von
<br>
Ehr refers to is Robert A. Freitas Jr., who is writing the books on
<br>
nanomedicine, called, appropriately, Nanomedicine. He has currently produced
<br>
two volumes. (Betterhumans 2/14/03)

<p>'Sticky' DNA crystals promise new way to process information. Imagine
<br>
information stored on something only a hundredth the size of the next
<br>
generation computer chip--and made from nature's own storage molecule, DNA.
<br>
A team led by Richard Kiehl, a professor of electrical engineering at the
<br>
University of Minnesota, has used the selective &quot;stickiness&quot; of DNA to
<br>
construct a scaffolding for closely spaced nanoparticles that could exchange
<br>
information on a scale of only 10 angstroms (an angstrom is one 10-billionth
<br>
of a meter). The technique allows the assembly of components on a much
<br>
smaller scale and with much greater precision than is possible with current
<br>
manufacturing methods, Kiehl said. The work is published in a recent issue
<br>
of the Journal of Nanoparticle Research. (EurekAlert 2/6/03)

<p>Education overhaul urged for nanotech revolution. Nanotechnology is taking
<br>
on a life of its own, inexorably changing electronics in the same way as the
<br>
transition from tubes to integrated circuits. But the educational community
<br>
has yet to respond, and research officials are concerned that the fledgling
<br>
industry will not grow unless nanotechnology becomes a standard part of the
<br>
U.S. physics and chemistry curriculum. Academics and research leaders aired
<br>
their concerns at a workshop devoted to nanotechnologies held here last week
<br>
in conjunction with the DesignCon 2003 conference. Some asked for
<br>
nanotechnology to be introduced in a preliminary stage to students at the
<br>
K-12 level. (EETimes 2/6/03)

<p>Governor breaks ground on advanced nano-research center at UCLA. Officials
<br>
broke ground Friday on what was billed as the world's most advanced facility
<br>
for atomic-level research. The California NanoSystems Institute at the
<br>
University of California, Los Angeles will explore the power and potential
<br>
of manipulating atoms to engineer new materials and devices. &quot;Nanotech may
<br>
be one of the world's smallest sciences, but it has the greatest potential,&quot;
<br>
Gov. Gray Davis said at the ceremony. The state will provide $100 million
<br>
for the facility, with another $138 million coming from private industry,
<br>
foundations and federal grants, officials said. (Modbee.com 2/14/03)

vision which has been outlined by scientists speaking at the American

<br>
have described how wires can now be made by yeast organisms, and how solar

<p>Race on to build first robot insect. Walking silicon chip only a year away.
<br>
By 2004 the world's densest computer - 400 of them could fit on the surface
<br>
of a grain of salt - could be powering the first walking silicon chip, with
<br>
legs that move like a Mexican wave. If that works, the next step could be a
<br>
robot insect the size of a housefly. Nanotechnology - the science of
<br>
materials and machines measuring a billionth of a metre - has become big
<br>
business, with more than 450 firms, 270 university departments and $4bn
<br>
(£2.48bn) worth of investment in the US, Europe and Japan. (Guardian

<p>Tiny technologies could help Oregon make it big. With a carefully trimmed
<br>
beard and wire-rimmed glasses, Kevin Drost seems like an ordinary man with
<br>
ordinary thoughts -- until the conversation turns to Siamese fighting fish.
<br>
In his eyes, the exotic fish holds an important key to Oregon's economic
<br>
future. Scientists believe they can produce a tiny biohazard sensor using
<br>
unique, toxin-detecting cells in the fish's skin. &quot;If we can do what I think
<br>
we can do, we can have multiple million-dollar business here,&quot; said Drost,
<br>
co-director of the Microtechnology Breakthrough Lab at Oregon State
<br>
University. &quot;We are way ahead of everyone else in this particular field.&quot;
<br>
Some of Oregon's most influential residents believe research done at the
<br>
tiniest of scales -- on molecules one-billionth and one-millionth of a meter
<br>
in size -- will save the state from its economic tailspin and prop up its
<br>
business infrastructure for years to come. Oregon has plenty of competition:
<br>
Dozens of states and individual universities have already delved into
<br>
so-called nano- and microtechnology research. (billingsgazette.com 2/15/03)

<p>Acid stops bacteria swimming. Microbes' motors are sensitive to their
<br>
internal pH. Lowering the pH inside a bacterium stops its motor, shows new
<br>
research. The finding could help those trying to learn how to make
<br>
microbe-sized machines. Spinning hairs called flagella enable microbes to
<br>
swim towards nutrients or away from toxins: they turn anticlockwise for
<br>
forward motion, and clockwise to change direction. Researchers are keen to
<br>
understand such chemically driven biological motors, which are only
<br>
millionths of a millimetre across, as electronics do not work on this scale.

<p>Chip is 400th the size of grain of salt. A microscopic computer chip so tiny
<br>
that 400 could fit on a grain of salt will begin to revolutionize
<br>
electronics next year, scientists said yesterday. Dr James Ellenbogen, a
<br>
physicist at the Mitre Corporation, a research institute based in Virginia,
<br>
said a working memory the size of a human cell would be complete by the end
<br>
of 2004. He told the American Association that it would be &quot;the densest
<br>
memory ever&quot;. &quot;When they introduced the IBM personal computer it came with
<br>
16 kilobytes of memory - eight times this,&quot; he said. &quot;You would have shrunk
<br>
the memory of an old IBM PC into the space of about eight human cells. It's
<br>
awfully small.&quot; The memory chip is created from a lattice of minute wires
<br>
upon which are placed individual molecules capable of storing digital
<br>
information. Dr Ellenbogen said that by stacking the chips on top of each
<br>
other it should be possible to store a gigabyte of information on a device
<br>
the size of a grain of salt.

<p>'Gadget printer' promises industrial revolution. The idea of printing a
<br>
light bulb may seem bizarre, but US engineers are now developing an ink-jet
<br>
printing technology to do just that. The research at the University of
<br>
California in Berkeley will allow fully assembled electric and electronic
<br>
gadgets to be printed in one go. The idea was revealed at a December
<br>
workshop on robotic algorithms in Nice. Instead of creating a casing and
<br>
then laboriously filling it with electronic circuit boards, components and
<br>
switches, the plan is to print a complete and fully assembled device. The
<br>
trick is to print layer upon layer of conducting and semiconducting polymers
<br>
in such a way that the circuitry the device requires is built up as part of
<br>
the bodywork. When the technique is perfected, devices such as light bulbs,
<br>
radios, remote controls, mobile phones and toys will be spat out as
<br>
individual fully functional systems without expensive and labor-intensive
<br>
production on an assembly line.
