Damien writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My suggestion had been that by using this fact (if it is one!) you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establish a code with your future self (or descendents/later collaborators)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permitting a message to be sent back to the present, depending on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absence or presence of absorbers at various locations.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, so here's a scenario that illustrates the difficulty
<br>
I see.  The year is 2010 and one DB is anxious to establish
<br>
communication with a future self.  Since going faster than
<br>
light is not possible, he's concluded that he must contact
<br>
himself after a Tipler Omega point has begun to form.
<br>
<p>So with the suitable kind of radio telescope, he aims at
<br>
a very specific place in the sky known to as many decimal
<br>
places as possible.  Sure enough, the transmitter has
<br>
trouble now and then, and in such a way as to reveal the
<br>
desired message.  A future person, who could only be DB
<br>
himself (because of the nature of the personal information
<br>
communicated) speaks to him!
<br>
<p>Then DB is hit by a bus, or fails to get frozen, or some
<br>
other horrible thing happens to him.  Then, 97 billion
<br>
years later, during the big crunch, quite a number of
<br>
versions of DB are run by the Omega Point.  Some want
<br>
to talk to the original DB.  One in particular &quot;remembers&quot;
<br>
the right coordinates, and starts picking up photons there
<br>
(with the permission of the Omega Point, of course.)
<br>
<p>Now then.  This becomes overly complicated in terms of 
<br>
MWI, because in MWI, it *definitely* will happen that
<br>
on October 9, 2010, a DB will do just as indicated.
<br>
And furthermore, on October 9, 97,003,192,226 A.D.
<br>
the &quot;receiving&quot; DB will establish contact.  But we
<br>
would have to ask the probability of this, and thus
<br>
enquire into the density or measure of this slice.
<br>
So we avoid this for now.
<br>
<p>The remote DB tries hard to remember exactly how his
<br>
end of the conversation went back in 2010.  Fortunately,
<br>
he's been equipped with some notes provided by the
<br>
Omega point, who collected photons at other places
<br>
which depict the notes nicely.
<br>
<p>However, any finite set of notes will be subject to 
<br>
random perturbations as the remote DB reads them and
<br>
recalls how the conversation went.  This will affect
<br>
the local DB, and the possibility of &quot;noise&quot; and
<br>
feedback will either halt communications or push them
<br>
onto a fixed point.  Or---more likely---a periodic
<br>
solution will obtain, with a cycle of points in the
<br>
space being reached.  To illustrate, remote guy recalls
<br>
A being said, but says A in such a way that B is heard,
<br>
which causes B to be said later, but C is heard, and
<br>
eventually we are back to A.  In non-linear dynamics,
<br>
this is call a periodic solution.  A fixed point is
<br>
a periodic solution with period 1.
<br>
<p>This is similar to a known method of dealing with 
<br>
time travel in SF.  In one of my favorite stories,
<br>
&quot;Other Tracks&quot;, the protagonist opportunistically
<br>
changes the past, and, after he's got what he wants,
<br>
changes it back again.  We can interpret this as an
<br>
ensemble of universes (similar to the ergodic
<br>
hypothesis in physics), where the point in the state
<br>
space eventually returns arbitrarily close to where
<br>
it began.  In other words, a periodic solution, or
<br>
an &quot;asymptotically periodic&quot; orbit is obtained.
<br>
(See the best book on non-linear dynamics, namely
<br>
&quot;Chaos: An Introduction to Dynamical Systems&quot;, by
<br>
Kathleen T. Alligood, Time D. Sauer, and James A.
<br>
Yorke(!), which is at the same time very accessible
<br>
and yet technically rather thorough.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I still think it's a rather nifty idea.  But I wonder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I might have lifted it from a Greg Egan determinism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short story. (I don't have his collections handy, alas.)
</em><br>
<p>I haven't seen it before, and I read Axiomatic pretty
<br>
carefully.  (Of course, he's written quite a few more
<br>
short stories than that.)
<br>
