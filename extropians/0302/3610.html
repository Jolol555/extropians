<p>This kind of notion is what motivates governments
<br>
to go to *any* extreme to deal with the source of
<br>
threats, in a courageous attempt to restore the
<br>
former sense of peace.  Bad move, Kai.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, which technology is _not_ vulnerable? Airplanes, power stations,

</em><br>
<p>I am arguing that subways are in a class all by themselves
<br>
for vulnerability.  They cannot reasonably set up a
<br>
passenger screening system like the airlines have,
<br>
yet any agent can slay an airplane-like load of
<br>
people with very little expense or effort.  The Korean
<br>
incident last week demonstrated that a dollar's worth
<br>
of flammable liquid and a match in the hands of a
<br>
single suicidal agent can slay 100 or more infidels.
<br>
<p>If the agent goes to a modicum of effort, she can
<br>
arrange a two minute ignition delay with a bottle of
<br>
alcohol in a backpack.  She most likely could pull
<br>
it off without being caught.  She could do it with
<br>
materials that are not in themselves illegal to
<br>
possess or carry around.
<br>
<p>Europe and Asia rely more heavily upon subways than
<br>
does the US I believe, perhaps because those continents
<br>
had a number of major cities that were invented before
<br>
cars, making them inherently more suited to subways.
<br>
<p>I predict that all the world's subways will be
<br>
effectively useless within 10 years.
