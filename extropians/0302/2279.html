<p>Well, I am not sure if the question is one of whether there are better 
<br>
spokespersons for immortalism than Jackson--I don't doubt that there are many 
<br>
worthy candidates. The Arnie scenario sounds great. But is that scenario 
<br>
presenting itself? I think Jackson's possible association with immortalism, 
<br>
cryonics, etc could be VERY good for the movement.  With respect to his 
<br>
status as a popular culture icon, he is on the verge of moving into uncharted 
<br>
terrtory.
<br>
<p>Jackson has also been rumored to have visited Alcor when it was in SoCal.  
<br>
<p>His previously referenced pro-immortalism statement was obviously sincere 
<br>
(given the obvious fact that he is a bad liar (see how he reacted to 
<br>
questions on how many facial surgeries he had)).
<br>
<p>I think Jackson is manipulating the media so as to improve his presence and 
<br>
visibility as a pop icon.  He may not want to be seen as &quot;all good.&quot; 
<br>
Being &quot;bad&quot; can be good for notoriety as a pop icon (like at rap hip hop 
<br>
stars, etc).
<br>
<p>I just hope that he does react to this latest round of publicity with more 
<br>
interviews. And if he does get interviewed, I hope the media asks him about 
<br>
immortalism, cryonics, extropianism, etc.  BTW, he is really the world's 
<br>
foremost transhuman. How can anyone here deny that? Some people here have 
<br>
changed their name and sculpted their bodies, but how do they compare to what 
<br>
jackson has done in the transhumanist realm? He comes across as almost non-
<br>
human.... If he aint the human most nearly posthuman, there cannot be but a 
<br>
very few ahead of him.
