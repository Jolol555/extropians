<em>&gt;Actually this is a more serious figure than ever before. This is the sort of commitment that led to higher figures in fusion research (before they pulled the plug, or most of it). Even if nano only gets 10 billion of the 100 billion it deserves, this will be enough. Nano is so broad it will have a &quot;snowball effect&quot;, just as the internet did. More and more projects will accumulate to it because nano applications and manipulations are as as broad as the material world itself. It is a sort of extension of life and sentiency into more of the substructure of the biosphere and the sentient-derived-gaiasphere.

<em>&gt;Scientists seem to believe in MEMS and materials nanotech no probs. My prediction for when they generically start to treat assemblers seriously (first stages): 2010, very seriously 2015.

<p><p>THe problem seems to be that the goal of most &quot;free market&quot; science
<br>
research is to get just enough research done to get a news article in
<br>
the papers, thus generating a boost in investment capital, thus
<br>
generating a fat bonus for the executives running the company, after
<br>
which the effort is abandoned, the purpose having been acheived, i.e.,
<br>
getting the execs rich, the research ends when the funding runs out.  
<br>
<p>Govt research, OTOH, has different goals. This govt research will
<br>
probably yield real results:
