<p><em>&gt; Here is a question for those of you with better maths than me. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Between about 2:50 gmt and 3:05 today I was locked out of my house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and standing on my front step. I noticed in the western sky at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 5 degrees or so from the horizon, there was what looked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like a wide, short con trail pointing virtually straight down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and slightly left.  It kind of resembled the shape of a comet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trail but was very short and squat.  The length was only about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5 time the width with a blunt pointed bottom and a more pointed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top.  It was slightly brighter than the clouds. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; It didn't move like the clouds so I could see that if was a long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way off and at high altitude.  It did move slightly to the left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over a period of 10 mins while I watched it.  My initial thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was that it was a meteor trail or a near earth brush through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upper atmosphere.  After watching it I concluded it must simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a very strange cloud. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Now having just seen the news and read the posts about the shuttle,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm thinking maybe that is what I saw.  But here is the stumper,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm in the UK! 
</em><br>
<p>So far as I can see, the only points above Texas that are visible
<br>
from the UK are at a height of about 3000 miles.  So that rules
<br>
out the Shuttle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the maths say it not possible then, what a weird coincidence. 
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, but if the Iraqis are right, and Allah has demonstrated His
<br>
displeasure with the U.S., then you may have witnessed an ancillary
<br>
Divine indicator.
<br>
