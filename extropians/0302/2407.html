<em>&gt; ### No, you got it backwards - it is the punishment of polluters that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduces pollution and saves lives. Punishing gas users is almost irrelevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this context - a 50 mpg car without catalytic exhaust harms more people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a 15 mpg car with it, both by increased pollution and decreased safety.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By confusing the issue of gas use with the issue of pollution you are doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a disservice to both of them.

<em>&gt; Data on survival in crashes shows that solidly-built cars do reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mortality rates. Rafal
</em><br>
<p>Oops I wrote a nearly identical comment a few minutes
<br>
ago, before I read this.  My comments are redundant.
<br>
<p>Regarding bigger cars saving lives in crashes, I would
<br>
certainly take the word of Rafal, who if I recall is
<br>
a doctor, and so would be in a position to see first
<br>
hand the results of car crashes.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, big cars are more expensive up front
<br>
and more costly to operate, so if people are motivated
<br>
to drive them, they will work harder and longer at
<br>
their jobs, which benefits everyone in the long
<br>
run.  Society benefits from their increased labors
<br>
and the worker has increased motive to be all that
<br>
she can be.  spike
