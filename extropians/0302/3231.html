&quot;&quot;Anyway, coming back to the topic: The USA are NOT attacked by Saddam, so
<br>
they have no bloody right to invade his country and piss at his garden
<br>
fence with a GPS penis. It is a crime and Troubleyou Bush will be a criminal
<br>
if he does so. This is the democratic point of view. The momentary Bush
<br>
doctrine is an imperialistic stance which scares the rest of the world,
<br>
because it shows a tendency to drift away from democratic principles.&quot;&quot;

in action. I think you are placing to much &quot;faith&quot; in Democracy

It's only democracy if you live inside the US. It is dictatorship, although
admittedly not totalitarian and even possibly benign for many, if you live
outside the US.
