need one and with the features I need at that time. I don't want to care

about fuel, parking space and maintenance, but send the vehicle away when I 
<br>
don't need it any longer. I'd like to drive it when I want to and leave the

controls to the vehicle when I've better thing to do. And I only want to pay 
<br>
for the transportation, not for possessing the vehicle.
<br>
<p>Kai,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, of course in one sense you will pay for possessing the car.  If 
<br>
a car has a useful life of 1000 hours and you rent it for an hour then you 
<br>
will pay for that 1/1000th of its life that you used.  On top of that you pay 
<br>
for upkeep and the owners time &amp; profit.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, if you were using airplanes Warren Buffett just bought a company 
<br>
that supplies a service very much like what you seem to be wanting.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Buffett sells memberships to his service.  He buys airplanes and 
<br>
has them available -- with a crew naturally.  When you need an airplane he 
<br>
guarentees that you can rent the plane.  I have no further details on the 
<br>
service he offers.
