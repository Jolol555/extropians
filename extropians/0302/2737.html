Fri Feb 14, 2003 08:20 am Rafal Smigrodzki wrote supporting Mike Lorrey:
<br>
<em>&gt; As indicated above, this (USA) death toll is already among the lowest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the world.
</em><br>
<p>How best to translate this claim?
<br>
a) Black is really rather whitish in color when you look at it THIS way?
<br>
b) 42,000 killed, $200 billion costs per year is really ok, nothing much
<br>
to worry about here?
<br>
<p>Rafal has seized on one way of comparing statistics between countries
<br>
that appears to put the terrible USA road death toll in a good light.
<br>
When you compare countries you have to think about exactly what you are
<br>
comparing.
<br>
<p>How many miles of freeway do you think Greece has compared with the USA?
<br>
That's right, - hardly any.
<br>
<p>What are the safest roads to drive on?
<br>
That's right, - freeways.
<br>
<p>What do Americans clock up lots of mileage on?
<br>
That's right - freeways, the safest roads in the world.
<br>
<p>e.g. For year 2000, fatalities by type of road were:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USA     Portugal
<br>
<p>Freeway                     5,587         130
<br>
Outside Urban Areas        26,028       1,142
<br>
Urban Areas                10,206         588
<br>
Total                      41,821       1,860
<br>
<p>Greece analysis not available.
<br>
<p><p>So what Rafal is really claiming is that bowling along the USA
<br>
interstate at a steady 60-70mph is among the safest driving in the
<br>
world. And, guess what - he's exactly correct! If other countries had
<br>
more freeways like USA (assuming they had the spare land available!)
<br>
they would also be much safer to drive in.
<br>
<p>The organisations concerned with road safety are very aware of this
<br>
statistic. Efforts spent on freeway safety will have little effect on
<br>
reducing the total road death toll. That is why much more attention is
<br>
being paid to safety measures on urban and local roads.
