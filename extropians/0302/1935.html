</em><br>
<p>Actually, I'd say he's right in many ways, although I think his analysis of 
<br>
the reasons for the mistrust of some Europeans is flawed.  I think the 
<br>
Euro-scepticism is more complex than simply glorified jealousy, but in many 
<br>
circumstances equally silly.  I don't think it's a matter of weakness so 
<br>
much as &quot;just couldn't be bothered&quot;, and perhaps to some degree, 
<br>
fear.  Quite apart from it being laughably wrong, I find the whole &quot;you 
<br>
hate us coz we're strong&quot; argument to be quite narcissistic.
<br>
<p>Personally, I'm fearful of anyone who quotes god in every damn speech he 
<br>
gives.  I'm more fearful of a system where this seems to be a 
<br>
requirement.  This is something many Europeans have picked up on.  As 
<br>
someone who is perhaps more aware than most Europeans of the nature of 
<br>
religion and Govt. in the U.S., I would have concerns about the U.S. that 
<br>
just wouldn't appear on the radars of most Euros.
<br>
<p>He's certainly right about the GMO issue, and I'll have to remember the 
<br>
GMO/smoking argument :)  I'm sure there's many I can catch out with that 
<br>
one!  (As an aside, there's a big push by Govt. here at the moment to ban 
<br>
smoking in pubs and restuarants, a major change given our pub culture.  I 
<br>
guess they've realized that ciggy smoke doesn't pay much attention to 
<br>
smoking and non-smoking sections).
<br>
<p>I'd certainly agree with his disdain for the 
<br>
anti-globalization/war/GMO/next big thing crowd, I'm not fan of them 
<br>
myself.  Speaking of the anti-war lobby, many of you may not know that 
<br>
little ol' &quot;neutral&quot; Ireland has been facilitating the movement of U.S. 
<br>
troops as part of the recent build-up maneuvers (I'm suspecting they're 
<br>
moving more than troops through too, but that's just my opinion).  There 
<br>
have also been well reported (here) anti-war demonstrations outside the 
<br>
airport where this has been going on, who are also suspecting there's more 
<br>
being moved through than simply armed troops.  I live very close to an 
<br>
Irish air corps base, and my wife has been awakened by some strange sounds 
<br>
coming out of it in the wee hours of the morning.  I've heard such &quot;noises&quot; 
<br>
in the past myself, typically around times of &quot;strife&quot; in the Middle 
<br>
East/Yugoslavia.  Since we have nothing more in our airforce than some old 
<br>
cast-off Magisters (and I've been at a few airshows in my time) I can tell 
<br>
you that, IMHO, it sounds awfully like a turbojet or two on reheat.  But 
<br>
hey, that's just my ignorant opinion.
<br>
<p>I'm personally not all that bothered by the whole neutral or not argument 
<br>
that's going on at the moment (let's face it, our neutrality is a joke - do 
<br>
you think we'd be so obliging to Iraqi troops?).  But I can tell you one 
<br>
things that's bugging me.  Another item probably not reported in your local 
<br>
news is the recent breach of security at this airport by a member of the 
<br>
supposedly &quot;peaceful&quot; anti-war group.  She proceeded to inflict a cool half 
<br>
mils worth of damage to one of the U.S. transporters.  What bugs me is 
<br>
that; 1) The state has to pay for this, with my money no less, and 2) 
<br>
depending on the nature of the damage, she may very well have put lives at 
<br>
risk.
<br>
<p>And the kicker?  RTE interviewed a spokesman for one of these groups, and 
<br>
he distanced himself from her actions but never once condemned it!  Instead 
<br>
he gave some spiel about people being &quot;frustrated&quot; and such rubbish.  What 
<br>
crap.  The only ones complaining about it are pretty much all located right 
<br>
there outside the airport!  The rest of us really couldn't be 
<br>
bothered.  We've little appetite for war, and none for your average Middle 
<br>
Eastern dictator.  And perhaps even less for most of the left wing tree 
<br>
huggers who have little better to do than camp outside airports and make 
<br>
mischief.
<br>
<p>Am I annoyed that the U.S. (plus allies) is going to get rid of 
<br>
Hussein?  Not really.  Beats having them financing the little bastard, I 
<br>
suppose.  I would be much more impressed if they'd put away the 'going in 
<br>
to help the poor Iraqi people' tripe though, and stick to admitting they 
<br>
want him out.  They may very well in fact provide the Iraqi people with a 
<br>
wonderful new chance, but no one's buying into that as a major policy driver.
<br>
<p>Do I believe he's been a naughty boy with regard to ABC weapons?  Most 
<br>
likely.  Do I believe that there's evidence linking him to Al-Qaida?  I've 
<br>
not seen it, so I can't say I'm convinced that it exists.  But the more 
<br>
time goes on, the fewer reasons I can think of for not nailing the Bollocks.
<br>
<p>In summary, I think the author was right but for the wrong reason.  Except 
<br>
in the final paragraph.  I think he was on to something there.

<br>
<p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
