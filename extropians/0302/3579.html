U-S-A suffers from delusions of grandeur. Western Europe is a larger
<br>
economic unit than U-S-A. The world without U-S-A makes everything it
<br>
needs from paper clips to rockets which take us into space. U-S-A is
<br>
Canada's biggest trading partner but if U-S-A were to drop into a black
<br>
hole in space tomorrow, Canada would suffer economically for only a few
<br>
years as it can trade quite well with Asia (another economic bloc as big
<br>
as U-S-A) and Europe. Also Canada is bigger in area than our neighbour to
<br>
the south and would quickly become the &quot;New West&quot;.
<br>
<p>Right now, El Moron is frightening, if not terrorising the world with his
<br>
war-mongering evil-doer ways. As long as the UN maintains a strong
<br>
presence in Iraq, there is no threat of war with Iraq's neighbours. UN
<br>
peacekeepers have stayed for decades in other parts of the world. Why not
<br>
Iraq? How should the UN pay for the peacekeepers? By selling enough Iraqi
<br>
oil. If the UN force costs in the billions, so be it. Iraq will pay and
<br>
the peace will be maintained. There is no need for time limits on Iraq.
<br>
The most they have is a few box cars of biological and chemical agents
<br>
buried in the desert. Agents the use of which would be suicidal as long as
<br>
UN has a presence.
<br>
<p>El Moron is a terrorist thug who threatens to destabilize the Gulf region
<br>
and the world with a war which has UNKNOWN CONSEQUENCES (a point raised by
<br>
Madelaine Albright recently on CNN). Keeping the UN peacekeepers there in
<br>
place of El Moron's blood-lusting alternative has KNOWN CONSEQUENCES, ie
<br>
the consequences of PEACE.
<br>
<p>Yes we need a new resolution...a resolution for peace.
