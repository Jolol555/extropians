<p>Meanwhile, Fukuyama and Kass are continuing their stated mission of
<br>
preventing a posthuman world. Do not underestimate the opposition, they
<br>
have some very good strategic thinkers that fully realize that today is
<br>
just the first step towards eventual mortalist triumph. While some short
<br>
sighted conservatives do not think about antioxidants, telomeres and
<br>
uploading, there are others who do. If the transhumanists are asleep
<br>
(ahem) the rug rats will end up living (and *dying*) in a world defined
<br>
by somebody else.
