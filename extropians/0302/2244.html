<p>
I was referred to as saying
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; On this basis, I strongly disagree with Lee's assertion that the life of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 85-year old is less valuable than that of a 15-year old.  In extropic terms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think carrying on the 85 year-old knowledge base (given the means to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that) is much more valuable.  In evolutionary-based terms, of course, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; feels right to value the 15-year old who can better carry on the genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legacy.
</em><br>
<p>Firstly, I think that practically everyone on this list agrees
<br>
that it's inappropriate to speak of &quot;valuing&quot; others in any
<br>
objective or societal sense.  A huge and mostly wasted discussion
<br>
revolved last summer about the &quot;lifeboat question&quot;, namely, 
<br>
whether women or men are the more valuable to save.  Some argued
<br>
that men were &quot;more valuable&quot;, but I attempted a partial retort
<br>
that the ancient Romans might actually consider women to be &quot;more
<br>
valuable&quot;, partly because I knew that this would appeal to the
<br>
particular person making the claim.
<br>
<p>In conclusion, no one here is talking of &quot;valuing&quot; people
<br>
at the present time.  Finis.  I hope.  And the accusation
<br>
that I ever made such an assertion, above, is totally false.
<br>
<p>What we can all agree on (probably) is that the memories and
<br>
experiences of the 85 year old are much greater and deeper
<br>
than those of the 15 year old, and that if one could have a
<br>
book that transcribed the experiences and memories of each,
<br>
one would have a huge multi-volume tome on the one hand in
<br>
comparison to a slender lightweight novel on the other.
<br>
<p>My point was, of course, that any of us unfortunate enough
<br>
to ever have to triage, i.e. to choose, might very well---
<br>
given that no other information was available---prefer to
<br>
triage in favor of those who had the greater life expectancy.
<br>
<p>But again (hoping that the paragraph just written is not taken
<br>
out of context), we must NEVER lose sight for a moment of the
<br>
eventual goal of saving EVERYONE'S life.  We must attain the
<br>
very highest moral position in all this, which is to understand
<br>
and accept N.F. Fyodorov's Common Task, that is, if scientifically
<br>
possible, the resurrection of every person who has ever lived.
<br>
I fervently pray that Tipler's hypotheses turn out to be correct,
<br>
that information is never in fact lost, and that through an
<br>
eventual Omega Point everyone lives forever.  About Fyodorov:
<br>
<a href="http://www.venturist.org/fyodorov1.htm">http://www.venturist.org/fyodorov1.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The best source material for those unacquainted with immortalism,
<br>
Fyodorov, cryonics, or Tipler are Mike Perry's &quot;Forever For All&quot;,
<br>
and Frank Tipler's &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;.
