Mez noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;I could go on.  Suffice it to say, US foreign policy has not been one
<br>
of encouraging the spread of democracy and capitalism to the rest of
<br>
the world.  Much the opposite.  I would welcome a foreign policy that
<br>
was actually consistent with the principles this country was founded
<br>
on.
<br>
mez&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Let me not defend the undefensible, but these were the days when Mother 
<br>
Russia's Empire was riding high, and it was determined to enforce its empire 
<br>
everywhere in the world. Support for brutal dictatorships did not happen in a 
<br>
vaccum, but were against the zero-sum game played by the ruling communist 
<br>
party, in the Soviet Union. They supported vile, evil, mass murderers, also; 
<br>
and were never criticized by the Left at all. 
<br>
<p>Holding the US to a &quot;higher standard&quot; because &quot;we expect more of you&quot; is 
<br>
merely a head game and did not change the brutal facts on the ground, one 
<br>
iota. So we either let the Soviets put in their goons and we lose, or we put 
<br>
in our goons and we win a little bit. Of course our claim to a high moral 
<br>
standard suffers, but then in a world were that phrase sugar-coats true 
<br>
behavior, the dogs bark but caravan moves on.
