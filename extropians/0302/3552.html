Terry: You garbled too many quotes. Please keep the appropriate
<br>
headers- the parts where I spoke and the parts where the
<br>
other scientists (cosmologists, physicists, astronomers, etc.)
<br>
spoke, and then there is a person whose name is at the end
<br>
named Robert Ebert that I guess was disagreeing with every
<br>
statement by all persons. Too confusing to me to sort it
<br>
out.
<br>

<br>
<p>BTW: news to me that a model is not a theory...
<br>
I wonder what I've been doing the last n years!
<br>
<p>(&quot;models are merely visualizations&quot; ... what???).
<br>
To my understanding and last 20 years experience,  models are the
<br>
*applications* of the theory, that is what it meant when you see the
<br>
term 'model' used in scientific journal articles as well as when you
<br>
hear scientists talk. Models are usually described with math,
<br>
sometimes with computer code and so on. Maybe Robert Ebert has
<br>
different experience with this term, mine comes from astrophysics,
<br>
atmospheric physics, planetary science, geophysics.
