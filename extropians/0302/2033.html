<p>(1) AFAIK, coal is not suitable for deadly weapons and therefore of no 
<br>
value for villains of any kind, including &quot;corrupt despotic theocratic 
<br>
murderous regimes&quot;.
<br>
<p>Agreed, and if 'suitability for deadly weapons' was the only consideration
<br>
of what type of power source should be utilized, you could make a strong
<br>
case against nuclear and for coal.  However, other factors include a) cost
<br>
b) number of people it kills every year d) monopolistic domination
<br>
potentials etc. etc.
<br>
<p>(2) Coal is almost no hazard for human health, except when swallowed or 
<br>
hit on the head and therefore doesn't have to be kept safe and secured 
<br>
at all times.
<br>
<p>Certainly NOT true, the atmospheric irritants emmited by the combustion of
<br>
coal, including
<br>
<p>Sulphur dioxide (SO2) - respiratory disorders, impaired breathing 
<br>
Nitrous oxide (NOx) - respiratory disorders, infections, pulmonary diseases 
<br>
Carbon monoxide (CO) - fatal angina, various other effects 
<br>
Ozone (O3) - respiratory disorders, impaired breathing, asthma, edema 
<br>
Particulate matter (PM10) - various toxic particle (organic matter, carbon,
<br>
mineral dusts, metal oxides and sulphates and nitrate salts) effects, main
<br>
mortality factor due to fossil fuels    
<br>
Toxic substances, heavy metals - specific substance effects  
<br>
<p>are estimated by the the WHO in its 1997 report on sustainable development,
<br>
to account for 6% of the total 50 million annual global deaths.  That's
<br>
approximately 3 million deaths *every year* from atmospheric pollutants
<br>
released from the combustion of fossil fuels.  These are real people dying
<br>
real painful deaths every year.  3 million.  Outdoor air pollution in the
<br>
U.S. due to particulate pollution alone was estimated by the Environmental
<br>
Protection Agency (EPA) in 1997 to cause at least 20,000 premature deaths
<br>
each year.  3rd world countries, many of which cook on wood or dung fired
<br>
stoves, fare much worse.
<br>
<p>(3) The by-products of coal mining can be put back without any hazard 
<br>
for the biosphere.
<br>
<p>Except for the billions of tons of harmful chemicals and radioactive uranium
<br>
dumped into the air.  Sure you got your facts straight on nuclear power?  
<br>
<p>(4) Coal ashes is not dangerous and does not need to be kept off our 
<br>
biosphere for thousands of years.
<br>
<p>Except for the radioactive uranium present in it.  As well as the arsenic,
<br>
cadmium, cobalt, lead, mercury, nickel and vanadium.
<br>
<p>(5) Even a very large malfunction in a coal fired power plant could not 
<br>
devastate a large area, cost millions of lives and billions of Euros 
<br>
(please read about the effects of Tschernobyl '86 in FSU and Europe).
<br>
<p>Sure, Chernobyl killed 31 people when a pressurized steam channel blew (not
<br>
even a chemical explosion, let alone a nuclear one) and released approx 6%
<br>
of the radioactive contents of the reactor.  The accident resulted in 31
<br>
short term deaths, with 28 due to extremely high radiation exposures.
<br>
Addiotionally, some 200,000 clean up workers received average exposures of
<br>
twice the yearly permitted, and a few thousand more receieved ten times the
<br>
permitted yearly doses.  Of the 116,000 nearby residents evacuated, 95%
<br>
received less than the average of the fist group of cleanup workers.  A
<br>
remaining 400,000 received significantly less than that.  For the 1,116,000
<br>
total affected out of the workers, evacuaees, and nearby residents, the
<br>
predicted long term radiation induced cancer deaths and normally non-fatal
<br>
throid cancers are projected to be some 3,500.  Mainly late in life.  Most
<br>
of these could have been avoided had the Soviet governemnt acknolwedged the
<br>
nuclear nature of the accident and adminstered the iodide pills it had all
<br>
ready stockpiled for just such an incident.  However, this reactor would
<br>
have never been built, licensed, or operated in any country that gave a shit
<br>
about its people, unlike the soviet union, which had a long track record of
<br>
sacrificing thousands if not millions for 'the good of the state'.
<br>
<p>In addition to the estimated 3 million annual deaths from atmospheric
<br>
pollutants...
<br>
<p>1984 Bhopal accident at a chemical plant in India caused some 3000 early
<br>
deaths and several hundred thousand severe health effects.
<br>
<p>Dam failures and overtopping have caused thousands of deaths and massive
<br>
disruption in social and economic activities with the displacement of entire
<br>
towns - the Varont dam overtopping in Italy and dam failures in Gujarat and
<br>
Orissa in India are three such examples, each with several thousand
<br>
fatalities. 
<br>
<p>Severe coal mine accidents causing several hundred deaths are not rare. 
<br>
<p>Explosions and major fires in the oil and gas industry have involved both
<br>
occupational and public fatalities and injuries. A pipeline gas leak
<br>
explosion in the Urals involved 500 fatalities. 
<br>
<p>There are estimated to be a few hundred CO related deaths every year in the
<br>
US due to faulty or innefecient fossil fuel burning home heating systems.
<br>
<p>On and on...
<br>
<p>(6) An exploding LNG tanker may have the mechanical power of a small 
<br>
A-bomb, but it will not make the whole area inhabitable for years. BTW, 
<br>
what would you prefer as a terrorist attack, an oil tanker rammed into a 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;harbour at full speed, or an atomic bomb on the same area?
<br>
<p>How difficult do you think it would be to detonate a single hulled tanker
<br>
full of LNG with the explosive capacity of a nuclear bomb?  How many of
<br>
these tankers sit unguarded in ports all over the world?
<br>
<p>&quot;All this results in much higher costs for nuclear power systems.&quot;
<br>
<p>All of this idealogicial intellectual dishonest endorsement of fossil fuels
<br>
over nuclear power leads to thousands if not millions of deaths every year.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Risk assessment calculates the probability of a risk multiplied by the
<br>
cost of the consequences. An important factor for the latter is, how many
<br>
people and their belongings (incl. industry) are affected. In
<br>
Western-Europe, with its population density between 200 and 300 p/km^2  (New
<br>
York: 270), the consequences of only one greater nuclear accident  outweight
<br>
every catastrophy even large numbers of exploding coal plants  could achieve
<br>
:-)&quot;
<br>
<p>But how many people die every year right now from fossil fuel combustion?
<br>
As I have said, its some multiple of millions.  Every year.  
<br>
<p>&quot;But I agree that burning fossil fuels is not very intelligent either. As
<br>
long as we don't have any technology to predict/control the large scale
<br>
effects of our actions, we are wise to reduce our influence on the ecosphere
<br>
wherever possible. On the long run, we will have to develop sustainable
<br>
technological systems on this planet, regardless of how complex and
<br>
high-tech they may be.&quot;
<br>
<p>I say a few well guarded breeder reactor plants to provide a majority of the
<br>
worlds power.  These same plants could electrolyze water to provide clean
<br>
drinking water and hydrogen as fuel for a 'hydrogen economy' or, at least,
<br>
create synthetic fuels through sabatier cells using existing hydrocarbon
<br>
infrastructures but not contributing to greenhouse gas increases (as the
<br>
sabatier cell needs CO2 from the atmosphere)  At least until fusion becomes
<br>
viable.  Reducing the global standard of living is not an option, as many
<br>
millions in third world countries need energy, and lots of it, to get out of
<br>
poverty.
