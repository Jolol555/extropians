<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be much more likely to incorporate a nano assembler in some

<p>If you are speaking of a general purpose mint: *Why* do this? The risks of
<br>
runaway go up vastly. Why not just create as many (small) isolated environments
<br>
(&quot;sandboxes&quot;) as are deemed prudent, put the GP mints there and keep them starved
<br>
for some rare feedstock?
<br>
<p>Even if you are talking about specialized assemblers, it's probably smart to include
<br>
multiple limitations into both the assembler and the biological source code.
<br>
And make the breeding of assemblers a throttleable process; consider carefully
<br>
whether most assemblers ought to be able to reproduce themselves at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However this would be very difficult for the

</em><br>
<p>True. So there's a tradeoff. Some stuff doesn't get efficiently made by bug chains.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When they do get these nano asseblers up and running in labs it will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting to see their evolution occuring even at that level. Maybe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the first one replicates 10 to the 100th power they will evolve 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough. But will they still be funtional? If we select the functional 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones to survive will they evolve enough?
</em><br>
<p>Evolution by mutation is risky. It appears that's what you're talking about here.
<br>
I don't want a general purpose assembler mutating but still functioning, and I'm
<br>
pretty cautious-minded about green goo in general.
<br>
<p>The &quot;standard model&quot; of molecular nanotech that some folks like to dismiss has it
<br>
that AIs will help to design better and better assemblers, along with better and
<br>
better AIs. We might get SkyNet or COLOSSUS, or we might get Friendly AI. Or the
<br>
bus might be late while we stand in the cold fog by the streetlamp.
<br>
<p>I expect back-pressure from society, and a few surprises. Unfortunately, the
<br>
surprises I anticipate are sometimes contradictory. Oh well.
