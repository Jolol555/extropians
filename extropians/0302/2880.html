<em>&gt; The FDA has a less progressive attitude than you, my friend, and I am

<p>### Psychoanalysis of my ego doesn't really strengthen your conclusions.

<p>At least we agree on the FDA.

<em>&gt; Below is yet *another* positive research finding concerning selegiline
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (deprenyl). In this double blind controlled study, selegiline was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found to improve verbal memory in Alzheimer's patients (we've been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussing Parkinson's here, mostly, but selegiline (deprenyl) has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also been found useful in Alzheimer's).
</em><br>
<p>### I am all for it. I never denied that deprenyl has beneficial symptomatic
<br>
effects.

<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Concerning this report below of enhanced verbal memory from selegiline
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (deprenyl), this is probably a good time for me to mention the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprising and unusual benefit that I *personally* have experienced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from this drug:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Immediately, literally on the day of my first 1 mg dose, I noticed a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dramatic improvement in my ability to understand the lyrics in music.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lyrics that had previously been lost in the loud background
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instrumentals suddenly became discernible to me. Popular tunes that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had heard and enjoyed literally hundreds of times over the years on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the radio, but without understanding most of the lyrics, suddenly made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lyrical sense to me. Moreover my general appreciation of music
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improved along with my ability to understand the lyrics. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased ability to appreciate lyrical music was entirely surprising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me. I would guess that this positive effect is related to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancement of verbal memory as seen in these Alzheimer's patients:
</em><br>
<p>### Good for you! I really have no problem with the promotion of deprenyl as
<br>
a nootropic, since here you present evidence of better quality, a
<br>
double-blind randomized trial.

<em>&gt; ABSTRACT:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; L-deprenyl therapy improves verbal memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in amnesic Alzheimer patients.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ABSTRACT
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Altered monoaminergic neurotransmission could play an important role
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the cognitive dysfunctions typical of dementia of the Alzheimer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; type (DAT).  DAT is not, however, a homogenous phenomenon inasmuch as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two forms are distinguishable: early onset (EO) and late onset (LO).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moreover, focal patterns of neuropsychological deterioration fall into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various subgroups. According to our hypothesis, DAT patients, who at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the onset of the disease mainly manifest memory disorders, also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represent a specific subgroup characterized by impaired cortically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projecting catecholaminergic pathways. In a 6-month randomized,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; double-blind, cross-over study versus placebo we analysed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence of L-deprenyl on the verbal memory of 19 amnesic EO-DAT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patients. Verbal memory was assessed by means of the Rey Auditory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Verbal Learning Test. The results obtained show significantly better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performances for L-deprenyl treated patients in learning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long-term memory skills. We suggest that L-deprenyl, through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selective inhibition of MAO-B and by increasing the activity of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catecholaminergic systems, positively influences cognitive functions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and behaviour founded on memory efficiency.
