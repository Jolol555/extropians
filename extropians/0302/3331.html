<p>
Spike posts a piece from the NY Post, a history quite
<br>
inaccurate in my view.  No mention anywhere of how
<br>
France got to be the biggest country in Europe.  No
<br>
mention of the wars they actually won, including
<br>
Louis XIV's extremely costly ones that gave France
<br>
its extensive boundaries.  No mention of the way that
<br>
French military science was so envied and adopted
<br>
around the world that even all our usual terms
<br>
---Captain, Lieutenant, Colonel, etc.,---
<br>
and so on, are mostly of French origin.  It was France
<br>
who ended Spain's near invincibility in 1650, and then
<br>
went on for over two hundred years being
<br>
the biggest and most feared superpower.  After Waterloo,
<br>
French might was still feared, much as Germany's was
<br>
and perhaps is.
<br>
<p>You know, speaking of nations that lose wars, it may have
<br>
a subtle effect on their psychology.  Notice how Sweden's
<br>
army terrorized Europe for centuries---so warlike, so
<br>
feared on the battlefield, until Peter the Great pulled
<br>
their teeth.  Since then---it seems to me they've been a
<br>
rather peaceful bunch.  And now, in another thread it's
<br>
wondered why the Germans sound so peaceful, e.g. on this list,
<br>
while it's the Americans and Brits who're warlike.  Well,
<br>
they've not had a drubbing recently.  Hmm.

<em>&gt; The Complete Military History of France.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gallic Wars - Lost. In a war whose ending foreshadows the next 2,000 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years of French history, France is conquered by, of all things, an Italian.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hundred Years War - Mostly lost, saved at last by female schizophrenic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who inadvertently creates The First Rule of French Warfare: France's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; armies are victorious only when not led by a Frenchman.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Italian Wars - Lost. France becomes the first and only country to ever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lose two wars when fighting Italians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wars of Religion - France goes 0-5-4 against the Huguenots.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thirty Years War - France is technically not a participant, but manages 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get invaded anyway. Claims a tie on the basis that eventually the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other participants started ignoring her.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War of Devolution - Tied. Frenchmen take to wearing red flowerpots as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chapeaux.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Dutch War - Tied.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War of the Augsburg League/King William's War/French and Indian War - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lost, but claimed as a tie. Three non-outright defeats in a row cause 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historians to correctly label the period as the height of French 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War of the Spanish Succession - Lost. The war also gave the French their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first taste of a Marlborough, which they have loved every since.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American Revolution - In a move that will become quite familiar to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future Americans, France claims a win even though the English colonists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw far more action. This is later known as &quot;Gaulle Syndrome,&quot; and leads 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Second Rule of French Warfare: France only wins when America does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of the fighting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; French Revolution - Won, primarily due the fact that the opponent was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also French.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Napoleonic Wars - Lost. Temporary victories (remember the First 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rule!) due to leadership of a Corsican, who ended up being no match for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a British footwear designer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Franco-Prussian War - Lost. Germany first plays the role of drunken 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frat boy to France's ugly girl home alone on a Saturday night.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; World War I - Tied and on the way to losing, France is saved by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United States. Thousands of French women find out what it's like to not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only sleep with a winner, but one who doesn't call her &quot;Fraulein.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sadly, widespread use of condoms by American forces forestalls any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvement in the French bloodline.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; World War II - Lost. Conquered French liberated by the United States and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Britain just as they finish learning the lyrics for &quot;Deutschland Cber 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alles.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War in Indochina - Lost. French forces plead sickness, take to bed with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Dien Bien Flu.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Algerian Rebellion - Lost. Loss marks the first defeat of a western army 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by a non-Turkic Muslim force since the Crusades, and produces the First 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rule of Muslim Warfare: We can always beat the French. This rule is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identical to the First Rules of the Italians, Russians, Germans, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; English, Dutch, Spanish, Vietnamese and Esquimaux.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War on Terrorism - Surrenders to Germans and Muslims just to be safe. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Attempts to surrender to Vietnamese ambassador fail after he takes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refuge in a McDonald's.
