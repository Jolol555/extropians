<p>Highest death rates in midsize sports cars: The vehicles with the
<br>
highest death rates are all sports cars -- the Chevrolet Camaro, Camaro
<br>
convertible, and Pontiac Firebird. These three models have very high
<br>
death rates in single-vehicle crashes, and this has been true model year
<br>
after model year (see Status Report, Oct. 9, 1996). The single-vehicle
<br>
death rates, including high rollover rates despite low centers of
<br>
gravity, reflect both the performance capabilities of the sports cars
<br>
and the risk-taking characteristics of many of their drivers.
<br>
<p><p>Interesting....
<br>
<p><p>Addittionally.
<br>
<p>In the last several years there have been (very approximately...I don't have 
<br>
the numbers in front of me) about 4 or 5 thousand of the above mentioned 
<br>
highway deaths that involved &quot;Big Trucks&quot;.....that is ....semi's.  Of that 
<br>
number the Federal Agency involved in regulating transportation... (what was 
<br>
it's name...let's see...FHMVSA?...DOT?....ICC?....dunno for sure....there are 
<br>
sooooooooo many of them)..........states that over 80% of all fatal accidents 
<br>
involving an automobile and a semi (a four-wheeler and a big truck)...were 
<br>
caused by the driver of the auto.
<br>
<p>All that being said.....
<br>
<p><p>Why is the government &quot;cracking down&quot;....viewing with alarm....and passing 
<br>
new (very onerous) regulations on BIG TRUCKS?...

Big Truck Driver
<br>
<p><p>ps...
<br>
<p>your typical big truck driver travels further in one month (12,000 miles)  
<br>
than the typical four wheeler does in a year...so far I've logged over a 
<br>
million miles...more than most 4-wheelers do in their whole lives..4 million 
<br>
is not uncommon for a big truck driver's career....some as many as 5million.
<br>
<p>The number of  accidents per mile driven of big trucks is the lowest of 
<br>
anything on the road..of fatal accidents by FAR the lowest...
<br>
<p><p>a big truck is NOT a pickup
