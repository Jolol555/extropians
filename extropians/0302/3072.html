</em><br>
<p>Neither necessarily. First, it's not my *position* that I would encourage
<br>
anyone to be concerned with, but rather my line of argument which
<br>
most people are capable of checking for themselves.
<br>
<p>I did outline some of the factors I had considered in getting to my
<br>
current position because I hoped that some others might check my
<br>
reasoning for errors.
<br>
<p>Since you ask, this is my current position.
<br>
<p>Should the US invade Iraq with Security Council approval if it can
<br>
get it?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;-  Yes.  (If the Security Council will give it. I'm satisfied that this
<br>
body
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would only actually make the decision to invade if it was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly warranted. ie. It will err on the side of not
<br>
invading)
<br>
<p>Can the Security Council invade Iraq WITHOUT Security Council
<br>
approval in the form of a new resolution releasing them from their
<br>
commitments under 1441 and the UN Charter?
<br>
<p>- No.     I don't think so.
<br>
<p>I think the US  NEEDS another resolution UNLESS it is willing to
<br>
invalidate its commitment to the UN under the Charter and the terms
<br>
of 1441.
<br>
<p>Can the US do this?    It can.  But it REALLY doesn't want to.
<br>
<p>As to do it WITHOUT a new Security  Council resolution given the
<br>
existence of the Charter which it signed and 1441 which it signed
<br>
would amount to the US breaching ITS OWN agreements with the UN.
<br>
This is very serious and would wreck the UN.
<br>
<p>In this circumstance the US would (as a matter of foreign policy not law)
<br>
need to give some justification for such a breach as the US is not going
<br>
to just become a rouge state. In my opinion the *only* justification the
<br>
US could give for not keeping its agreement with the UN would be to
<br>
argue that the UN itself had proven to be a flawed body incapable of
<br>
carrying out its purpose as described in Article 1. That is, the US would
<br>
have to argue that the Security Council had effectively refused to accept
<br>
the responsibility for *effectively* maintaining international peace and
<br>
security, generally, as a result of the Security Council specifically
<br>
failing
<br>
to decide that &quot;serious consequences&quot; under 1441 amount to an invasion.
<br>
<p>The argument by the US would be that the new global circumstances
<br>
of post-September 11 constitute a new type of threat and that the
<br>
Security Council was failing to effectively respond to that new type
<br>
of threat as per the Charter. That new type of threat would be the
<br>
coupling of a rouge State like Iraq's with its assumed capacity to
<br>
produce weapons of mass destruction and its assumed willingness to
<br>
arm terrorists of the sort of organisational skill and efficiency of the
<br>
September 11 group.
<br>
<p>Now if you are asking me if I think the US would be justified in making
<br>
such a tough call (which amounts to a wholesale negation of the UN
<br>
Charter) due to say intransigence on the part of other Security Council
<br>
members then I would have to say its IS possible but it depends.
<br>
<p>It depends on what the standard of proof should be in practice for
<br>
deciding to go to war. And here at last (imo) is the real problem. No
<br>
*practical* standard of proof for deciding when to go to war has ever
<br>
been agreed to.
<br>
<p>Consider. In a murder trial the standard of proof is beyond reasonable
<br>
doubt. That's quite a high standard but it is certainly not beyond *all*
<br>
doubt. To say beyond *all* doubt it to set the standard infinitely high
<br>
as who could ever say with confidence that absolutely all doubt had
<br>
been removed.
<br>
<p>In a civil trial the standard is on the balance of probabilities. This
<br>
lower standard is appropriate because the lower standard recognizes
<br>
that in matters such as torts, if a wrong decision is made the
<br>
consequences are less likely to be devastating. A wrongful conviction
<br>
for murder has high downside risk. This is not ultimately about the
<br>
downside risk to the individual wrongly convicted rather it is ultimately
<br>
about the downside risk to society of people seeing that someone like
<br>
them, an innocent, was wrongly convicted.
<br>
<p>Now consider the standard of proof that is being held up as necessary
<br>
in order to justify the decision to go to war. There is none. There is NO
<br>
serious *practical* standard of proof and this is *precisely* the problem.
<br>
<p>Everybody says War is bad and everybody is right.
<br>
<p>Everyone talks about war being the last option and many people agree
<br>
with that too. But such is not an operationalisable standard it is mere
<br>
rhetoric and idealism. It fails as a standard because it puts all the risk
<br>
on one side and effectively means no war can ever be launched in
<br>
practice for any reason.  Sound nice only if you are willing to forget that
<br>
this means that terrorist attacks on civilians would not be able to be
<br>
pre-empted they would only be able to be &quot;avenged&quot; after the fact.
<br>
<p>Let me give an example. I am not aiming at a moral argument I am
<br>
aiming to diagnose and resolve a problem.
<br>
<p>Consider this quote from Jacques Chirac from today's Australian.
<br>
(<a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,6007022%255E2">http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,6007022%255E2</a>
<br>
703,00.html - EU unites to warn Iraq. )
<br>
<p>&quot;'We consider that war is always, always, the worst solution....
<br>
which leads us to conclude that it is not necessary today to have a
<br>
second resolution, which France could only oppose,' Mr Chirac
<br>
said.&quot;
<br>
<p>Exactly. Chirac is starting from the axiom that war is always (x2) the
<br>
worst solution and then reasoning from it.
<br>
<p>Well that's pretty idealist and in practise it puts all the risk on the
<br>
side of not going to War even when it is almost definitely justified.
<br>
(This point would be true irrespective of the particular case of Iraq).
<br>
<p>Operationally the standard for going to War that Chirac is using
<br>
is an *infinitely* high one. It can never in practice be reached.
<br>
<p>So leave aside considerations of the actual risk of a go-to-war
<br>
don't-go-to-war as it relates to Iraq. The problem is that there
<br>
is no practical standard in place and that the worlds leaders do all
<br>
have very real pressures and very real constituents to satisfy.
<br>
<p>It serves no purpose to blame the French or the American's the
<br>
solution imo is.
<br>
<p>1) First recognize that the Security Council needs to have
<br>
a general standard of proof for going to war that is practical in
<br>
terms of managing the absolute risks not just the one side risk or the
<br>
unoperationaliseable &quot;war is always a last resort&quot;. If the Security
<br>
Council can't agree to this in principle than it is never going to be
<br>
able to solve a particular case satisfactorily and so imo any nation
<br>
would be entitled to walk away from the UN as its irrelevance
<br>
as a body for maintaining security would be conclusive..
<br>
<p>2) Only once it is clear that a general practical standard for deciding
<br>
when to go to war is in place (and this need not be made public
<br>
- Saddam for instance doesn't need to see it), only then should
<br>
the Security Council move on to the question of applying the specific
<br>
risks (including the risks of too-early-action and late-action)
<br>
to the general standard.
<br>
<p>My point is that step 1 should be relatively easy and the US would
<br>
be smart to get moving on it as a failure by the Security Council to
<br>
agree to the principle of formulating a practical standard would itself
<br>
imo simplify and crystallise the US position. If they have no choice but
<br>
walk away from the Security Council and the UN it is best that they
<br>
be able to show fair minded serious people why. Hence the prudence
<br>
of decoupling the steps..
