<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But the Samantha's of the world never notice that the Viet Cong was 
<br>
never heard of again after the Tet offensive.  We destroyed it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what has that got to do with Iraq?  It is the same thing.  Today 
<br>
Samantha is busy building the opposition up to be 10 feet tall.  The army 
<br>
that we destroyed in 3 days is now so fearsome that we dare not defend 
<br>
ourselves today.  The same people that delighted in seeing us bring Sadaam 
<br>
down a peg then is going to rise up in mass and smite us down today.  Heck in 
<br>
50 years of constantly trying they haven't even been able to bring down 
<br>
little Israel but we are helpless just the same.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However Samantha will have an effect -- possibly.  If she encourages 
<br>
Sadaam to resist us longer than he would have other wise then Samantha will 
<br>
have managed to get some people killed that would have lived otherwise.  That 
<br>
is certainly the lesson of Vietnam.  The Vietnamese say a million of their 
<br>
people died in that war while the North was being encouraged to hang on until 
<br>
the peaceniks could stop the resistance to their genocide.  Not pretty.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well put, Ron, but Samantha could care less as she has illustrated. 
<br>
The point being, in her mind, Saddam is not the villain, we are. The 
<br>
Indochinese communist butchers weren't the villains, we were.  Remember, the 
<br>
Vietnam War was &quot;senseless.&quot; I'm still trying to figure out why it was 
<br>
acceptable in most people's minds for us to oppose an invasion force of 
<br>
135,000 North Koreans in 1950 but the same folks could care less that a Viet 
<br>
Cong deprived North Vietnamese launched a 200,000 man strong invasion of the 
<br>
South in 1972.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wonder why the same people who constantly remind us of Kent 
<br>
State and My Lai are so silent about the North Vietnamese massacres at Hue 
<br>
during the Tet Offensive, when 25% of the population of that city were 
<br>
killed. In many cases, whole families were rounded up, surrounded by land 
<br>
mines, and exploded. Those that weren't were lucky enough to dig their own 
<br>
graves before being shot.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is of course Pol Pot's Cambodia, in which roughly 2 million 
<br>
lives were extinguished between 1975-79. One of the worst examples of this 
<br>
was Pol Pot's prison, Tuol Sleng, where of the 14,000 prisoners, only 7 
<br>
survived.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as we know, US involvement there was &quot;senseless&quot;, and &quot;the worst 
<br>
kind of tyranny.&quot; It's funny, Samantha and those like her tell us that we 
<br>
shouldn't remove Saddam, &quot;because there are worse dictators out there.&quot; Well, 
<br>
frankly I can't conceive of more heinous regimes than that of Pol Pot and Ho 
<br>
Chi Minh, but attempting to prevent their crimes is &quot;pointless and 
<br>
reprehensible&quot;, because &quot;we killed people too..&quot; It's odd, but &quot;we killed 
<br>
people too&quot; when we prevented the Nazis from dominating the world, and 
<br>
Samantha seems okay with that... :)
<br>
<p>Remember, ONLY the Nazis were bad...

America and little that is right.&quot;
