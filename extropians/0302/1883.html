<p><em>&gt; &gt; The biggest questions that such problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pose for me is &quot;why am I better informed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than my neighbors&quot;, and &quot;how do I account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for judging my information and knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be superior to theirs?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which is a valid reason for protesting instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something drastic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now, in certain contrived hypothetical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; situations, I really do have objectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better information, and would act on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I alone were talking to aliens on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; regular basis, and had a good explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as to why I was the *chosen* one, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there are all sorts of things that I might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do as a publicity stunt to get my views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; well known.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; sarcasm noted and all,
</em><br>
<p>I'm not being sarcastic!  (Why does this always
<br>
happen to me?  ;-)
<br>
<p>Use your imagination.  What if you really *were*
<br>
contacted by aliens, and over several years shown
<br>
many interesting and valuable things?  Suppose
<br>
further that you had good explanations for why
<br>
you weren't crazy.  (Of course, one can never
<br>
know for sure that one is *not* crazy, especially
<br>
under peculiar circumstances.  But there comes a
<br>
time when you'd have faith in yourself and Them.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If I don't, on the other hand, have special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowledge, then all I would do is vent my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; indignation by joining action committees,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; writing letters to newspapers and magazines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attending local neighborhood meetings, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; virtually anything that still fell within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Kant's Imperative.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Why are your methods acceptable and theirs not?  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you look to the history of most of our lovely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracies, not all the citizens have even been able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get any recognition in these manners while their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights were directly violated.  So are you just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; referring to current society, and assuming that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone has a say?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Everything that I'm saying is predicated upon
<br>
living in a democratic republic with safeguarded
<br>
individual rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or were the civil rights protests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the 60's obnoxious as well?  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, to me, they were.  Note I'm not debating the
<br>
efficiency of such tactics, but merely denying that
<br>
in this case the end justifies the means.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not all protests take to the streets, there are many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on college campuses, not in the way of anyone.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recall at the University of Rochester numerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protests against Sweatshop Labor since the Dean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refused to disclose information as to where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; University clothing was being made.  Never did they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interrupt learning, never did they infringe on anyone. 
</em><br>
<p>I have much less problem with those, then.  Probably
<br>
the organizers wouldn't mind a bit if their opponents
<br>
held counter-demonstrations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was in the habit of being annoyed at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all protests at the time and was generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather curt to them along with various other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protests on the campus.
</em><br>
<p>I'd still be annoyed.  But perhaps not so much
<br>
as I would be over a silly pep-rally!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But in retrospect I'd have never known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they might have had Sweatshop Labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produced nor would most of the rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the student body.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, to take the slower and fairer route
<br>
is not as efficacious, as I was saying.
<br>
I would still prefer posted flyers and
<br>
handouts over rallies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Dean was forced to come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clean and they achieved an end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good deed without causing any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grief except to the guilty party.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is undemocratic?
</em><br>
<p>Not in any major way, undemocratic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If you do disturb traffic, or &quot;march&quot; in support of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; various causes, how do you explain to yourself that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's all right for you to do this, but it wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be all right if everyone did it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This doesn't follow.  It wouldn't be 'alright' for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *everyone* to do most things that *some* people do. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This of course doesn't happen so we maintain diverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professions in the workplace and function as a nation.
</em><br>
<p>What examples are you thinking of?  Sure, I don't
<br>
want *everyone* to subscribe to this mailing list,
<br>
but at the same time I *do* want people to subscribe
<br>
to mailing lists and communicate the way we do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since it is legal to protest under certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulations, I assure you that the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of people who are driven enough to protest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already do [march &amp; protest], and to assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
</em><br>
<p>I think instead that there are many people
<br>
who care just as deeply, but who don't 
<br>
happen to be organized.  I hope that they
<br>
don't organize.  The present people who
<br>
*are* organized also hope that all the
<br>
rest of those who're unhappy don't organize.
<br>
It would be better IMO if everyone stopped
<br>
organizing for protest marches and demon-
<br>
strations.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The cause has to be strong enough for them to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivated to spend a lot of time, sometimes money,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes risking dismissal from their job which pays
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to feed their families.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Disturbing traffic is no more than a petty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconvenience for something that, you've so far not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinced me otherwise, is a good peaceful check in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the democratic process.
