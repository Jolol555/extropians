<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, I'd say he's [Thomas L. Friedman] right
</em><br>
<p>I have copied the Friedman remarks again at the bottom for easy reference.
<br>
Apologies to those who prefer bandwidth conserved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in many ways, although I think his analysis of the reasons for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistrust of some Europeans is flawed.  I think the Euro-scepticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more complex than simply glorified jealousy, but in many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances equally silly.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, one always runs grave risks when speculating about the
<br>
motives of nations or groups of people.  On its best reading,
<br>
Friedman is referring to the (probably existing) resentment
<br>
and envy afflicting some proportion of Europeans.  But by no
<br>
means can this suspicion be articulated against those who put
<br>
up logical arguments against U.S. policies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think it's a matter of weakness so much as &quot;just couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be bothered&quot;, and perhaps to some degree, fear.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's also a component of the mix.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Quite apart from it being laughably wrong, I find the whole &quot;you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hate us coz we're strong&quot; argument to be quite narcissistic.
</em><br>
<p>Agree totally.  Even calling it an &quot;argument&quot; is being too
<br>
generous by far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally, I'm fearful of anyone who quotes god in every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damn speech he gives.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I've heard every U.S. president from Eisenhower to Clinton
<br>
say almost the same thing (though perhaps less frequently).
<br>
The behavior, not the words, is what to watch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm more fearful of a system where this seems to be a requirement.
</em><br>
<p>Seems logical, but again, I'm not sure that we've seen actual
<br>
evil consequences flowing from all the &quot;God talk&quot;.
<br>
<p>I totally agree with the remainder of James' review, especially
<br>
his summary statement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Friedman]'s certainly right about the GMO issue, and I'll have to remember the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GMO/smoking argument :)  I'm sure there's many I can catch out with that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one!  (As an aside, there's a big push by Govt. here at the moment to ban 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smoking in pubs and restuarants, a major change given our pub culture.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess they've realized that ciggy smoke doesn't pay much attention to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smoking and non-smoking sections).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd certainly agree with his disdain for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-globalization/war/GMO/next big thing crowd, I'm not fan of them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself.  Speaking of the anti-war lobby, many of you may not know that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little ol' &quot;neutral&quot; Ireland has been facilitating the movement of U.S. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troops as part of the recent build-up maneuvers (I'm suspecting they're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving more than troops through too, but that's just my opinion).  There 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have also been well reported (here) anti-war demonstrations outside the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airport where this has been going on, who are also suspecting there's more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being moved through than simply armed troops.  I live very close to an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Irish air corps base, and my wife has been awakened by some strange sounds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming out of it in the wee hours of the morning.  I've heard such &quot;noises&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the past myself, typically around times of &quot;strife&quot; in the Middle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; East/Yugoslavia.  Since we have nothing more in our airforce than some old 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cast-off Magisters (and I've been at a few airshows in my time) I can tell 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you that, IMHO, it sounds awfully like a turbojet or two on reheat.  But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hey, that's just my ignorant opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm personally not all that bothered by the whole neutral or not argument 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's going on at the moment (let's face it, our neutrality is a joke - do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think we'd be so obliging to Iraqi troops?).  But I can tell you one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that's bugging me.  Another item probably not reported in your local 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; news is the recent breach of security at this airport by a member of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposedly &quot;peaceful&quot; anti-war group.  She proceeded to inflict a cool half 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mils worth of damage to one of the U.S. transporters.  What bugs me is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that; 1) The state has to pay for this, with my money no less, and 2) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on the nature of the damage, she may very well have put lives at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the kicker?  RTE interviewed a spokesman for one of these groups, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he distanced himself from her actions but never once condemned it!  Instead 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he gave some spiel about people being &quot;frustrated&quot; and such rubbish.  What 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crap.  The only ones complaining about it are pretty much all located right 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there outside the airport!  The rest of us really couldn't be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bothered.  We've little appetite for war, and none for your average Middle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eastern dictator.  And perhaps even less for most of the left wing tree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huggers who have little better to do than camp outside airports and make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mischief.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Am I annoyed that the U.S. (plus allies) is going to get rid of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hussein?  Not really.  Beats having them financing the little bastard, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose.  I would be much more impressed if they'd put away the 'going in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to help the poor Iraqi people' tripe though, and stick to admitting they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want him out.  They may very well in fact provide the Iraqi people with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonderful new chance, but no one's buying into that as a major policy driver.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do I believe he's been a naughty boy with regard to ABC weapons?  Most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely.  Do I believe that there's evidence linking him to Al-Qaida?  I've 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not seen it, so I can't say I'm convinced that it exists.  But the more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time goes on, the fewer reasons I can think of for not nailing the Bollocks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In summary, I think the author was right but for the wrong reason.  Except 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the final paragraph.  I think he was on to something there.

<p>Ah, Those Principled Europeans
<br>
<p>By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN
<br>
<p>BRUSSELS -- Last week I went to lunch at the Hotel Schweizerhof in Davos,
<br>
Switzerland, and discovered why America and Europe are at odds. At the
<br>
bottom of the lunch menu was a list of the countries that the lamb, beef and
<br>
chicken came from. But next to the meat imported from the U.S. was a tiny
<br>
asterisk, which warned that it might contain genetically modified organisms
<br>
&lt; G.M.O.'s.
<br>
<p>My initial patriotic instinct was to order the U.S. beef and ask for it
<br>
&quot;tartare,&quot; just for spite. But then I and my lunch guest just looked at each
<br>
other and had a good laugh. How quaint! we said. Europeans, out of some
<br>
romantic rebellion against America and high technology, were shunning
<br>
U.S.-grown food containing G.M.O.'s &lt; even though there is no scientific
<br>
evidence that these are harmful. But practically everywhere we went in
<br>
Davos, Europeans were smoking cigarettes &lt; with their meals, coffee or
<br>
conversation &lt; even though there is indisputable scientific evidence that
<br>
smoking can kill you. In fact, I got enough secondhand smoke just dining in
<br>
Europe last week to make me want to have a chest X-ray.
<br>
<p>So pardon me if I don't take seriously all the Euro-whining about the Bush
<br>
policies toward Iraq &lt; for one very simple reason: It strikes me as deeply
<br>
unserious. It's not that there are no serious arguments to be made against
<br>
war in Iraq. There are plenty. It's just that so much of what one hears
<br>
coming from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and French President Jacques
<br>
Chirac are not serious arguments. They are station identification.
<br>
<p>They are not the arguments of people who have really gotten beyond the
<br>
distorted Arab press and tapped into what young Arabs are saying about their
<br>
aspirations for democracy and how much they blame Saddam Hussein and his ilk
<br>
for the poor state of their region. Rather, they are the diplomatic
<br>
equivalent of smoking cancerous cigarettes while rejecting harmless G.M.O.'s
<br>
&lt; an assertion of identity by trying to be whatever the Americans are not,
<br>
regardless of the real interests or stakes.
<br>
<p>And where this comes from, alas, is weakness. Being weak after being
<br>
powerful is a terrible thing. It can make you stupid. It can make you reject
<br>
U.S. policies simply to differentiate yourself from the world's only
<br>
superpower. Or, in the case of Mr. Chirac, it can even prompt you to invite
<br>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe &lt; a terrible tyrant &lt; to visit Paris just
<br>
to spite Tony Blair. Ah, those principled French.
<br>
<p>&quot;Power corrupts, but so does weakness,&quot; said Josef Joffe, editor of
<br>
Germany's Die Zeit newspaper. &quot;And absolute weakness corrupts absolutely. We
<br>
are now living through the most critical watershed of the postwar period,
<br>
with enormous moral and strategic issues at stake, and the only answer many
<br>
Europeans offer is to constrain and contain American power. So by default
<br>
they end up on the side of Saddam, in an intellectually corrupt position.&quot;
<br>
<p>The more one sees of this, the more one is convinced that the historian
<br>
Robert Kagan, in his very smart new book &quot;Of Paradise and Power,&quot; is right:
<br>
&quot;Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus.&quot; There is now a
<br>
structural gap between America and Europe, which derives from the yawning
<br>
power gap, and this produces all sorts of resentments, insecurities and
<br>
diverging attitudes as to what constitutes the legitimate exercise of force.
<br>
<p>I can live with this difference. But Europe's cynicism and insecurity,
<br>
masquerading as moral superiority, is insufferable. Each year at the Davos
<br>
economic forum protesters are allowed to march through the north end of
<br>
town, where last year they broke shop windows. So this year, on
<br>
demonstration day, all the shopkeepers on that end of town closed. But when
<br>
I walked by their shops in the morning, I noticed that three of them had put
<br>
up signs in their windows that said, &quot;U.S.A. No War in Iraq.&quot;
<br>
<p>I wondered to myself: Why did the shopkeepers at the lingerie store suddenly
<br>
decide to express their antiwar sentiments? Well, the demonstrators came and
<br>
left without getting near these shops. And guess what? As soon as they were
<br>
gone, the antiwar signs disappeared. They had been put up simply as window
<br>
insurance &lt; to placate the demonstrators so they wouldn't throw stones at
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>As I said, there are serious arguments against the war in Iraq, but they
<br>
have weight only if they are made out of conviction, not out of expedience
<br>
or petulance &lt; and if they are made by people with real beliefs, not
<br>
identity crises.
