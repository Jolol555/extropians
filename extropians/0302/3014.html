I find this entire idea of &quot;banning&quot; Iraq discussion ridiculous, in the same 
<br>
sense that one might find the idea of banning stem cell research or abortion 
<br>
ridiculous. Let's just get a whole bunch of shouters together and silence 
<br>
public discourse. The fact that the war &quot;will not be decided here&quot; is 
<br>
irrelevant, given that almost anything not directly relating to the upkeep of 
<br>
this web site will not be directly &quot;decided here.&quot; So, why not ban all 
<br>
discussion?
<br>
And what's with randomly picking 3-4 months as the time frame of the ban? 
<br>
Should we, at the end of that period, call together the Extropian Security 
<br>
Council and vote to extend it if something so ghastly as differing opinions 
<br>
remain present? It has been said on this site before &quot;politics are only 10% 
<br>
of what's interesting that we discuss&quot;. That may be true, but it doesn't make 
<br>
it 10% of what's important. Almost any meaningful change in the foreseeable 
<br>
future will be need to be made through political/governmental channels, so we 
<br>
might as well acknowledge their existence.
<br>
In closing, I would say that it's unfortunate that some feel the list &quot;can do 
<br>
much better than this&quot; and feel the only solution is to dictate what should 
<br>
and what shouldn't be discussed. Some on the list have repeated the same 
<br>
frequent arguments, I agree. But others have repeatedly provided various 
<br>
links that I find both informative and or frightening. So I don't concur that 
<br>
the discussion is simply going around in a complete circle. There's room 
<br>
enough in my view for many different discussions on Extropy, and I for one 
<br>
think if you find the Iraq discussion less than illuminating, then don't 
<br>
participate.
<br>
