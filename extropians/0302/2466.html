<em>&gt;&gt;It is a fact that recent studies show that 1/3 of drivers

<p>This is somewhat hypocritical of me to say (been there, done that)
<br>
But if they could design a drug/alcohol tester similar to the diabetes
<br>
testers now on the market into the steering column of a car.
<br>
<p>They could prevent DUI's from both drugs and alcohol.  There would be
<br>
those 
<br>
who wire around such systems but that could be made a felony.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The paramount contributor to traffic deaths in the US is the
</em><br>
prevalence 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of youth drivers with insufficient training, and elderly drivers who
</em><br>
hold 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; onto drivers licenses long after they are no longer physically able
</em><br>
to be 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; responsible drivers. Other countries are much more strict about these
</em><br>
two 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; groups, which cause some 80% of all accidents.
</em><br>
<p>Many states are retesting seniors after they reach a certain age but
<br>
most only make 
<br>
them take the dring not the written part over.  They should include the
<br>
written
<br>
also because if you don't have the mental clarity to read the book or
<br>
answer the
<br>
questions, you don't belong behind the wheel either.

<em>&gt; The USA has 42,000 (and rising) traffic deaths per year. That is quite
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; a bit of damage to the economy, and to all the families involved.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This continuing increase in death goes along in line with the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The large size of the cars is *not* stopping the death toll on

</em><br>
<p>Actually, since the US road death toll has been DROPPING as a percentage
<br>
for a number of years, congruent with a rise in the use of SUV's, your
<br>
claims aren't so clear. I might also point out that the US death toll on
<br>
the roads used to be well over 50,000, but dropped significantly in
<br>
response to a society-wide campaign against drunk driving.
<br>
<p>It is a fact that recent studies show that 1/3 of drivers responsible

<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is very cynical to just shrug and say &quot;Well, people are free to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill themselves if they want to.&quot; Over half of these deaths are just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bystanders who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. People who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause accidents don't just kill themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To quote Leonard Evans again:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'U.S. traffic policy since the 1970s has been dominated by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delusion that safety can be achieved by changing vehicles to increase 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survivability in crashes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   As measured by traffic deaths per million registered vehicles, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. was the safest nation in the world in the early 1970s. Today it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in 13th place. Better-performing countries have not done anything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is either extraordinary or draconian -- they have simply not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fallen into the obsessive focus on marginal factors such as tires, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vehicle defects and airbags that dominate U.S. safety policy.'
</em><br>
<p>The paramount contributor to traffic deaths in the US is the prevalence
<br>
of youth drivers with insufficient training, and elderly drivers who
<br>
hold onto drivers licenses long after they are no longer physically able
<br>
to be responsible drivers. Other countries are much more strict about
<br>
these two groups, which cause some 80% of all accidents.
<br>
<p>In the US, despite state claims that driving is a 'priviledge' conferred
<br>
by the state, most citizens see driving as a right that should not be
<br>
confiscated under any but the most severe circumstances. There is the
<br>
popular notion that the UN Declaration of Human Rights declares a 'right
<br>
to drive'.
<br>
<p>ANY nation which is more free than another is going to have more of its
<br>
citizens being injured and killed from their own stupidity and
<br>
irresponsibility than those who live in the less free nation and are
<br>
coddle and protected by the state from themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By being dependent on excessive oil consumption, the USA is handing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over billions of dollars to the oil-producing countries and generating
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; huge amounts of wealth in those countries.
</em><br>
<p>Irrelevant. Fuel economy has no impact on vehicle safety, nor does the
<br>
degree to which gas consumers enrich third world thugs.
<br>
<p>I might point out that it is europe which consumes far more middle east
<br>
oil than the US does, so if anybody is enriching terrorists and tyrants,
<br>
europe is more to blame, which explains the current policies of France
<br>
and Germany.
