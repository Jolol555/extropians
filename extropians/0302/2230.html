Russell, Lee, and everyone:
<br>
<p>My most recent automobile purchase, and the *only* car I ever bought
<br>
new, was a Geo Metro.  Geo is a GM brand marketed in Canada for a number
<br>
of years, and was sold under various other names: Pontiac Firefly, Chevy
<br>
Sprint.  I has a 993cc, 3 cylinder engine and gets 50mpg in the city and
<br>
near 60mpg on the highway.  It was manufactured in North America.  It
<br>
was cheap.  I have had no troubles with acceleration or hills, and even
<br>
towed a 1000lb trailer across Canada without difficulty.  It'll do 75mph
<br>
all day, in hot weather, without overheating.
<br>
<p>I 'googled' the Geo Metro discovered that it was discontinued by GM in
<br>
1997.  I was flabbergasted!  This is a really good car, and I even like
<br>
its shape!  Mine is a 1996 with almost 50,000miles on the clock... and
<br>
nothing has ever broken!  North America car buyers *used to* have
<br>
options... I wonder why GM dropped this one?
