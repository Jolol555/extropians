<em>&gt; I am arguing that subways are in a class all by themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for vulnerability.  They cannot reasonably set up a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passenger screening system like the airlines have,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet any agent can slay an airplane-like load of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people with very little expense or effort.  The Korean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incident last week demonstrated that a dollar's worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of flammable liquid and a match in the hands of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single suicidal agent can slay 100 or more infidels.
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid I don't see this. Subways may be unusually vulnerable as a
<br>
transport system, although I actually doubt this - trains are just as
<br>
vulnerable as are major freeway systems. I vividly recall how the IRA twice
<br>
brought Britain's entire motorway network to a complete standstill with
<br>
strategically placed dummy bombs and bomb warnings. As for the other kinds
<br>
of technology Kai mentions how are these intrinsically less vulnerable?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe and Asia rely more heavily upon subways than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does the US I believe, perhaps because those continents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had a number of major cities that were invented before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cars, making them inherently more suited to subways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I predict that all the world's subways will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively useless within 10 years.
</em><br>
<p>If that happens several major cities (London being the first) will have to
<br>
be completely rebuilt or even abandoned (only 48% of Londoners own a car).
<br>
The point of course is that this won't happen because the threat is
<br>
overstated. I agree there are people other than terrorists who have some
<br>
kind of interest in causing major disruption/chaos e.g. the kind of idiots
<br>
who make false alarm calls but I don't see how they are enough of a problem
<br>
to cause that kind of disruption - *unless* the mass of the public are panic
<br>
prone enough to react in the way you suggest. A reassuring note on that
<br>
score: a few years ago, as you know, the then Government here announced
<br>
&quot;we've just had new advice from the scientist chaps, who tell us BSE can
<br>
actually get from beef to humans so we're facing human BSE and it could be a
<br>
handfull, it could be several million, we're not sure - but don't panic!&quot;
<br>
Price of beef falls to an all time low. TV news shows a woman pushing a
<br>
laden trolley of beef from a store. Asked &quot;Aren't you worried about BSE ?&quot;
<br>
she replies &quot;Well yes, a bit, but it's such a bargain!&quot; In fact the two
<br>
weeks after the announcement showed record sales of beef.
