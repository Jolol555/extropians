</em><br>
<p>Brinistas are guilty of injecting some objectivity into
<br>
the passion of a protest rally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bear in mind that a snapshot doesn't characterize the &quot;churn&quot; if any of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the crowd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To do that well, we would need to (oppressively?) track ins-and-outs 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No need for that at all.  Instead of reporting how
<br>
many people were at a rally, report the number of
<br>
human-hours were at such an event.  There will be always
<br>
a number of people who attend just long enough to
<br>
make the scene and say they were present, should it
<br>
become advantageous to do so, with little real interest
<br>
in the cause.
<br>
<p>A high flying Brincopter or equivalent, taking one photo
<br>
every minute for the entire duration, then integrating
<br>
over time would give a more accurate and meaningful
<br>
estimate of attendance.  It would be interesting to then
<br>
compare to a rock concert or the Bay to Breakers rallies,
<br>
a ball game or perhaps even a typical day at Disneyland.
<br>
<p>I would also want to compare the crowd to the ordinary
<br>
background rabble of proles one finds in any urban area.
<br>
I could go to Times Square at noon Monday with a ladder
<br>
and a bullhorn, shouting slogans in favor of universal
<br>
surveillance, then claim that 100k people attended my
<br>
rally.
<br>
<p>Just telling me how many people attended is meaningless.
<br>
I want to know how many are there for how long and how
<br>
many really mean it.
