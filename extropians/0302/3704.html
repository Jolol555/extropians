<p>Christian,
<br>
<p>So..., you don't feel this is playing out to be a truly heartfelt drama on the world stage which will deeply affect us?  Well, all I can say is that this is probably NOT going to be anything as definite and clearcut as a big-budget Hollywood production where the protagonist triumphs against the baddies in the end with every worry gone.  
<br>
<p>Afterall, where was Jack Ryan when those planes flew into the World Trade Center?  And where will he or James Bond be when in retaliation for the western occupation of Iraq, a large American city loses at least several hundred-thousand people (if not several million) to a bio-weapon, plutonium dispersal bomb, or a low kiloton nuke?
<br>
<p>If such a nightmare occurs, suddenly this &quot;tv war&quot; will become horrifying real to not only the friends and relatives of the dead, but to an entire nation and globe.  THE WORLD WILL THEN TRULY NEVER BE THE SAME.  It will be like we branched off into a parallel universe we don't want to inhabit.  
<br>
<p>I tend to think a big part of the reason Western Europeans are protesting the possible war so much is that they suspect the terrorists may decide to go after the &quot;European Satan&quot; by maiming one of its cities if the U.S. does move forward to occupy Iraq.  
<br>
<p>Still feeling so callous about things?  
<br>
<p>John
