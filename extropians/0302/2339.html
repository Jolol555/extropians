Spike:
<br>
<em>&gt; Those nations such as Italy and Babylon, that were invented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before there were cars, are set up differently.  Ive seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pictures of them, its truly amazing.  There are *homes* right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down *in* the city with all the businesses and stuff.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needn't drive far.  What a concept!
</em><br>
<p>In the ancient Rome traffic was a real tragedy. Carts, beasts
<br>
everywhere. And no sidewalk was there. And stalls spread
<br>
all over the city. Caesar issued a law to prevent daily traffic,
<br>
from dawn to sunset. Just very important people could
<br>
send their carts for shopping. So later, at night, the traffic
<br>
was constant. So Adrianus issued another law, to prevent
<br>
traffic from sunset to dawn!
