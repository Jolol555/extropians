### This law was in effect in Soviet Russia, with citizens forbidden to
<br>
travel more than a certain radius from the house assigned to them.
<br>
<p>If you, the other guy and both of your employers had access to all the
<br>
relevant information, arranging a job swap between the two employees so each
<br>
would work in his own town would be ... a snap. This would hopefully prevent
<br>
such sickening ideas as binding citizens to their house (also called
<br>
villeinage) from being formed.
