<p>Thanks, that one looks the most promising for the moment. Price is no
<br>
object.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I remove everything, but I'm paranoid about security!)
</em><br>
<p>I'm actually pretty paranoid about it myself, in case anyone has the
<br>
opposite impression. Though I was connected 24/7 by DSL, I was and am
<br>
still running the complete suite of McAfee internet security tools,
<br>
including firewall and antivirus. The antivirus app watches for suspect
<br>
email
<br>
attachments, yet even then I very rarely execute them. And yet my
<br>
low-security
<br>
password was still hacked remotely. I can only hope and pray that my
<br>
hi-security
<br>
password wasn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;. And even if it was installed, your firewall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should stop that program accessing the web unless you specifically give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it permission to do so.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and I suspect I may have been tricked by a &quot;friend&quot; into giving
<br>
something permission to bypass my fire-wall.
<br>
<p>One of the most important things I've learned from this is that today's
<br>
friends might turn into tomorrow's enemies. (Or, to put that another
<br>
way, today's friends may not actually be genuine friends.) This is a very
<br>
upsetting situation for me. I've barely slept in three days.
<br>
<p>Another thing I've learned, in reflecting at how I have responded to this
<br>
situation,
<br>
is that I have only the utmost admiration and respect and trust for the
<br>
people
<br>
here. This group was the first place I turned to for help. Thanks everyone.
