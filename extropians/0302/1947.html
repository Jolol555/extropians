</em><br>
<p>Kai:
<br>
<em>&gt; Yes I doubt about it, as far as Iraq and Saddam are concerned. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently has nothing to win with a war. Every open aggression would

</em><br>
<p>&quot;Currently&quot;, &quot;Concerned&quot;? Why? I understand that you acknowledge now the
<br>
positive role of democratic Power and US Army in history.
<br>
<p>&quot;Open agression&quot;? I think Saddam is specialist in secret aggressions. You
<br>
doubt about Second Holocaust  but I think it is very realistic scenario.
<br>
There is millions of people, tausends terrorists in Middle East that want do
<br>
it. He is dictator, that love Stalin and hate all others. He is psychic ill
<br>
and he has wmd. It will be very simple for him to transfer BC-weapon to
<br>
Israel, without trace. It is to dangerous for New York and for all others
<br>
too. Enough!!! Stop!!!. On this way we will never cross the Graet Filter.
<br>
Preston in last Wired:
<br>
WIRED: Does thinking about bioterrorism keep you awake at night?
<br>
PRESTON: Last fall, I started thinking that the anthrax terror attack might
<br>
be a prelude to a smallpox attack, and that kept me awake at night. Smallpox
<br>
is the one organism that makes me worry for my family.
<br>
<p>What makes it so much worse than anthrax?
<br>
<p>Smallpox knows how to make copies of itself. Unchecked, an outbreak of
<br>
smallpox will amplify globally in 20 weeks. The death rate for people
<br>
infected by natural, unmodified smallpox is one in three.&quot;
<br>
Kai, Hubert awake. It is not sci-fi. It is allready our real horror. Where
<br>
are we going to..?Somebody must end it, now. Not US is yours ennemy. We
<br>
haven't good law for such cases. Hubert, marines will do it, not for Pax
<br>
Americana, for my children (3, 7,9).  Later we can/must reorganize the
<br>
world. We will need extreme friendly social enviroments (democracy, much
<br>
love, no testosteron etc.) for new &quot;magic&quot; and dangerous technologies. Such
<br>
organisations as Iraq, North Korea should belongs to the past, or we
<br>
(people) have no future.
<br>
But now somebody must act!  You see yours ennemy in US.  I suspect you of
<br>
&quot;antiamericanismus&quot;, now &quot;typisch deutsch&quot;. Maybe I am wrong.  I come from
<br>
&quot;New Europe&quot; and trust in America more than Europe of Schroeder.
<br>
Sad?
<br>
No!
