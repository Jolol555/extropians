<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin said:

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Originally, Hubert, you wrote (and I quote)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; For the very very first time in the 48 years of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; life I feel a faint pride to be citizen of a nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that does not agree with US aggression all over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; globe, though its representatives may surrender at last.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now, either you must stand behind what you wrote, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maintain that that the U.S. is guilty of aggression all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over the globe, or you must clarify.  Which is it to be?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Guilty of aggression all over the globe as a FUTURE possibility IF the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperialistic dreams [of some] [and] imperialistic attitude of invading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one country after another that does not fit into Washington's concept.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for your clarification.  I had thought that you were
<br>
speaking of the present and past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Call me what you will or think of me what you will.
</em><br>
<p>Well ;-)  that applies to all of us.  I'll be the
<br>
last one to think badly of anyone because they
<br>
express coherent views on Extropians!   :-)  Thanks
<br>
always for yours too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will not engage in mind games about better or worse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superpowers anymore.
</em><br>
<p>Well, an important part of the truth is trying to see things
<br>
in relative perspective.  But, of course, suit yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am sick of being in the position where I must justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my peace loving attitude.
</em><br>
<p>I sincerely hope that you are not distressed by this.  I do
<br>
know that our exchanges can make us feel badly at times (for
<br>
I have also experienced revulsion at times).  But we can
<br>
try to take these matters in stride, and remain as clinical
<br>
as we can.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All of you, who are so war horny today, YOU (plural) are the ones who should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask yourselves if you still have anything to do with Transhumanism.
</em><br>
<p>We'll be dragging our evolutionary baggage with us probably
<br>
to the end of the universe.  No sense in hiding from it or
<br>
denying it.  When people are freely expressing views on subjects
<br>
close to them, it's inevitable that politics will come up.  I
<br>
don't really see anything wrong with it---when I'm not in the
<br>
mood for it, I skip such threads.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No power has the right to attack a country even if a monster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a dictator rules there.  The US/UK junta is going to ignite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a world fire pretty soon and the supporters of war among you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know it.
</em><br>
<p>Of course we don't know it!  We don't &quot;know it&quot; any more than
<br>
you &quot;know&quot; that the Middle East will be a lot better off after
<br>
the Western powers have gotten rid of Saddam Hussein.
<br>
<p>Lee
