<br>
<p>Addittionally.
<br>
<p>&quot;In the last several years there have been (very approximately...I don't
<br>
have the numbers in front of me) about 4 or 5 thousand of the above
<br>
mentioned highway deaths that involved &quot;Big Trucks&quot;.....that is ....semi's.
<br>
Of that number the Federal Agency involved in regulating transportation...
<br>
(what was it's name...let's see...FHMVSA?...DOT?....ICC?....dunno for
<br>
sure....there are sooooooooo many of them)..........states that over 80% of
<br>
all fatal accidents involving an automobile and a semi (a four-wheeler and a
<br>
big truck)...were caused by the driver of the auto.&quot;
<br>
<p>That doesn't seem surprising, since I would think there are a lot more Autos
<br>
on the road.  I would be interesting in seeing accident fault rates of autos
<br>
vs. big rigs that takes into account the relative number of each, and how
<br>
much time they spend on the road.  Though I suspect that the figure would
<br>
support the general gist of what your saying, since truckers drive
<br>
professionally as a job, its safe to say they are better at driving then you
<br>
average commute to work fella in a fancy SUV.  
<br>
<p>&quot;Why is the government &quot;cracking down&quot;....viewing with alarm....and passing
<br>
new (very onerous) regulations on BIG TRUCKS?...&quot;
<br>
<p>I think you answered your own question, BIG TRUCKS.  BIG TOBACCO.  BIG OIL.
<br>
BIG FAST FOOD.  Anything big is evil in the US, and the populace abandons
<br>
all notions of reason and logic if 'BIG' preceeds something.  
<br>
<p>&quot;your typical big truck driver travels further in one month (12,000 miles)
<br>
than the typical four wheeler does in a year...so far I've logged over a
<br>
million miles...more than most 4-wheelers do in their whole lives..4 million
<br>
is not uncommon for a big truck driver's career....some as many as 5million.
<br>
The number of  accidents per mile driven of big trucks is the lowest of
<br>
anything on the road..&quot;  
<br>
<p>Ah, guess that's what I was saying all along.  Interesting statistics
<br>
though.  
<br>
<p>&quot;of fatal accidents by FAR the lowest...&quot;
<br>
<p>This is the reason why I have fancied myself buying a big rig cab and using
<br>
it as my commuting vehicle (should I ever be able to afford a 80-90k
<br>
vehicle).  My favorite so far is the Volvo VN.

As a trucker, what kind of mileage do these things get when not hauling a
<br>
trailer?  The deplorably bad movie 'black dog' is an excellent excursion
<br>
into the safety of big trucks.
