<em>&gt; Neuroprotection by deprenyl and related compounds

<em>&gt; Mech Ageing Dev 1999 Nov; 111(2-3):189-200
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is an increasing number of data by in vitro and in vivo experiments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicating that (-)-deprenyl is neuroprotective to dopamine neurons, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though detailed mechanism remains to be clarified. In this paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuroprotection by (-)-deprenyl and structurally related compounds was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examined in concern with the suppression of apoptosis induced by a
</em><br>
reactive
<br>
<em>&gt; oxygen species, peroxynitrite generated from SIN-1. The apoptotic DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage was quantitatively determined using dopaminergic SH-SYSY cells and
</em><br>
by
<br>
<em>&gt; a single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. DNA damage induced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peroxynitrite was proved to be apoptotic by prevention of the damage by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cycloheximide or actinomycin-D. (-)-Deprenyl and other propargylamines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protected the cells from apoptosis in a dose-dependent way. (-)-Deprenyl
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protected the cells even after it was washed out, suggesting that it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiate the intracellular process to repress the apoptotic death program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The study on the structure-activity relationship of (-)-deprenyl analogues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revealed that a N-propargyl residue with adequate size of hydrophobic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure is essentially required for the anti-apoptotic activity. These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results suggest that (-)-deprenyl and related compounds may protect
</em><br>
neurons
<br>
<em>&gt; from apoptosis and be applicable to delay the deterioration of neurons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during advancing ageing and in neurodegenerative disorders.

<em>&gt; I'm reposting this abstract above, Rafal, because you failed to address
</em><br>
it,
<br>
<em>&gt; much less refute it, in your reply to the last message to you.
</em><br>
<p>### No need to refute it in the context of my claims - in vitro studies are
<br>
not evidence of anything whatsoever in PD, especially if clinical evidence
<br>
already excludes a clinical effect.
<br>
<p>See below.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think I have already posted several that make that claim, and I don't
</em><br>
know
<br>
<em>&gt;  why I should even bother to report more of them. I have quoted at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half a dozen abstracts here, Rafal, and you have failed to address the
</em><br>
data
<br>
<em>&gt; and claims in those abstracts in any detail whatsoever! Instead you just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep restating the same old argument (that selegiline is only helps with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symptoms rather than with neuroprotection, as if I didn't hear it the
</em><br>
first
<br>
<em>&gt; time), and you base that argument on the *single* study that *you*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally prefer to recognize as the *only* valid study, as if I and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone here should consider you to be the world's leading authority on
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; subject.
</em><br>
<p>### I don't need to address dozens of abstracts irrelevant to PD.
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You've given us no reason to believe that you have assessed the evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than other experts who specialize in this field and who still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently believe that the preponderance of the evidence supports the view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that selegiline is neuroprotective in PD. Maybe they are right or maybe
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; are wrong, but you Rafal certainly don't have a monopoly on such
</em><br>
knowledge.
<br>
<em>&gt; I will however for the moment concede that the evidence for
</em><br>
neuroprotection
<br>
<em>&gt; in PD is not unequivocal, and in fact I sincerely do agree that isn't,
</em><br>
just
<br>
<em>&gt; so that we can get past this point. Okay? Nevermind PD for now.
</em><br>
<p>### Experts at the American Academy of Neurology, as well as my mentors,
<br>
Professor F. Wooten, and other movement disorders specialists I am learning
<br>
from, have exactly the views I presented.  Experts in the field no longer
<br>
believe that selegiline is neuroprotective in PD. I am glad you agree on
<br>
this.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here above is again is the abstract I posted in my last message, which you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignored like most others I have posted. Please respond to it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detail.Specifically, please explain why this research does not support my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contention that selegiline is neuroprotective *in general* -- setting
</em><br>
aside
<br>
<em>&gt; for the moment any specific contradictions that might be present in the PD
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature. (Perhaps PD is not a good model for general life-extension
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purposes. After all neither you nor I have clinical PD (I hope) -- and as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stated in the header this discussion is really about performance
</em><br>
enhancement
<br>
<em>&gt; with selegiline for normal transhumanist folks like you and me.)
</em><br>
<p>### Now, as far as I remember, I never claimed that selegiline cannot be in
<br>
some regimens neuroprotective - my argument was strictly regarding the
<br>
neuroprotection in PD. Whether this drug is neuroprotective in tissue
<br>
culture, or in lab animals, or whether some dosing regimen (different from
<br>
the one tested in DATATOP) confers a clinical benefit, I do not know.
<br>
<p>In general, in vitro evidence can only be treated as a suggestion to start a
<br>
clinical trial, never as proof of clinical efficacy. If all that works in
<br>
the Petri dish or in a rat worked in humans, our life expectancy would be
<br>
two hundred years already. There are huge differences between what is
<br>
happening in your brain and in culture - these are different cells, in a
<br>
different medium, different oxygen concentration, their gene expression
<br>
patterns differ from the originals, there are significant interspecies
<br>
differences in anti-oxidant properties, and in susceptibility to
<br>
transformation, mostly they are actively dividing cells without the same
<br>
pattern of network connections, basically, comparing apples and oranges.
<br>
<p>Of course, since we have difficulty with looking at the brain in situ, we
<br>
have to use model systems, but always with the understanding that the final
<br>
arbiter of usefulness is the clinical trial.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to think you are not so closed-minded, Rafal. You have often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticized me for such, yet on this matter you are speaking from the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative perspective as do those who criticize the entire subject of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-aging medicine -- your hard-line skepticism about this subject is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardly in the spirit of transhumanism or extropianism.
</em><br>
<p>### You don't get much extropy from touting expensive medicines that work
<br>
only in rats but fail in clinical trials. I am full of hope and eager to see
<br>
progress in neuroprotection, in fact, this is the very subject of my own
<br>
research, to try to understand the mechanism of mitochondrial impact on the
<br>
death of neurons in PD and AD, but it is a hope tempered by a hard-nosed
<br>
skepticism - I see cool ideas that never pan out daily. One of the other
<br>
projects my group is working on now might actually lead to replacement of
<br>
damaged mitochondrial DNA - if..., if... if..., and I can see a lot of
<br>
reasons why it might fail. Maybe it will advance us into and era of
<br>
transhuman mitos, maybe not. .
<br>
<p>--------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that the abstract is dated 1999, far more recent than the study that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you've stated is &quot;the last word.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tell us why we should not accept this research as valid.
</em><br>
<p>### It's valid in its own right - as a suggestion for more basic research,
<br>
but not for popping pills.
