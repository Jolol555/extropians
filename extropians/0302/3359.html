<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wondered:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I should survive the global clean sweeping he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has in mind,
</em><br>
<p>Now look, you are reading a huge amount into one word
<br>
&quot;insane&quot; that Mike Lorrey happened to drop at the end
<br>
of one sentence in a very short, and rather emotional,
<br>
post.
<br>
<p>Even the title of this thread, which still includes
<br>
the questionable phrase &quot;Tim May calls for nuking of
<br>
D.C.&quot; which I leave here, reluctantly, only to make
<br>
my point, is highly questionable.  That too was *one*
<br>
obviously emotional phrase Tim May used at the end of
<br>
a post.  Well, please acknowledge: we all get worked
<br>
up from time to time, and we probably should not.
<br>
<p>No one here has called for all pacifists to be locked
<br>
up, and you know it.  So why the tremendous exaggeration?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; any pacifist from this list: please visit me in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CLIP - CLinic (for) Insane Pacifists -
</em><br>
<p>Talk about over-reacting!
<br>
<p>You or Samantha also wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and report me if America really has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; already returned to Cincinnatus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; farming or if they are still busy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; building new CLIPS.
</em><br>
<p>further fantasizing about CLIP, totally a
<br>
product of your and her imagination.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And Samantha invited me to her cuckoo-nest cell:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If the world survives you can come visit me in the next room any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time you like.  We can compare delusions of hope, peace and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; global prosperity and well-being.  We can get really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out-of-our-minds crazy and talk about a glorious future where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans transcended their slightly evolved monkey state and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prospered beyond any decent person's dreams.
</em><br>
<p>Everyone one on the *Extropians* list, for God's sake,
<br>
agrees with these eventual goals.  No one is questioning
<br>
that.  They simply contend that it won't be today or
<br>
even next week.  At best, this won't happen for decades,
<br>
and again, you know this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We also might muse about some new uploading techniques
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are not available yet.
</em><br>
<p>See, you think that the rest of us have just stopped 
<br>
thinking.  Few of us accuse *you* of that.  Give us
<br>
a break for a while---you are letting this Iraq thing
<br>
obsess you.  (Jesus Christ.  Now *I'm* starting to
<br>
almost say you're nuts!  I'm not so saying, because,
<br>
ordinary, fully sane people do simply get carried
<br>
away from time to time, especially when frustrated.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would really like to expand the body-mind-continua
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of some of our war supporters into the bodies of ALL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wounded but survived Iraqi civilians after Desert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Storm II with no more arms and legs and their guts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being fallen out so our hawks might experience their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain in a 10 second wave of encompassing sympathy.
</em><br>
<p>Gee, thanks for limiting it to ten seconds!  That's
<br>
really quite kind of you.  Appreciating the extent
<br>
to which some people's feelings have gotten clear
<br>
out of control, that's a nice concession.
<br>
<p>You have to know, when you see yourself start writing
<br>
like this, knowingly advocating greater pain and 
<br>
suffering, that something is out of kilter.  Yes,
<br>
I do appreciate that from your point of view, there
<br>
are *ABSOLUTELY* no reasons whatsoever to invade Iraq,
<br>
and so from your point of view we are all raving mad.
<br>
(Is this true, or not?  Or am I reading too much into
<br>
what *you* are saying, now?)  But that's what it sounds
<br>
like.
<br>
<p>How do you explain to yourself wishing totally 
<br>
gratuitous suffering on others publicly?
<br>
<p>(I admit that fleeting thoughts of revenge animate
<br>
the thoughts of most of us from time to time, but
<br>
most of us stay in better control!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Power to the insane!
</em><br>
<p>Try to stop yourself before you write things like
<br>
this.  I mean, for all I know, some of those memes
<br>
could really get back to you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Fight the assholicity of the Iraq war plans!
</em><br>
<p>Okay, but remain calm and try to stay relaxed and
<br>
rational.  (And the same for your opposite numbers
<br>
on the other side of the argument---like, hopefully,
<br>
me.)
<br>
<p>Lee
