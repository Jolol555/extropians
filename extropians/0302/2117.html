<p>
A spate of depressingly ignorant news coverage of the anniversary
<br>
inspired me to write this.  I'm not sure if there's any venue
<br>
that would interested in it, but there ought to be.  Also, since
<br>
this is an editorial piece rather than a scholarly work, I do not
<br>
include references for the assertions I make about human biology,
<br>
but I believe I have all my facts right.  Feel free to point out
<br>
any mistakes I may have made, though. 
<br>
<p>At any rate, it is an anniversay worth noting, and an issue worth
<br>
thinking about, because there will be more decisions in the area
<br>
of human reproductive technologies to come, and we should prepare
<br>
our arguments with an eye toward how non-extropians may view them.
<br>
<p><p>In Praise of Roe v. Wade
<br>
Lee Daniel Crocker, January 22, 2003
<br>
<p>The United States Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade has been
<br>
maligned by both sides of the abortion debate throughout the 30
<br>
years since it was issued on January 22, 1973.  It has been called
<br>
a &quot;non-decision&quot;, a &quot;cop-out&quot;, &quot;political weaseling&quot; and much worse.
<br>
You've probably heard some of those opinions recently.  Even though
<br>
many lawyers will tell you that in a civil case, a judgment that
<br>
both sides complain about is probably a good one, they nonetheless
<br>
will call this decision &quot;cowardly&quot; or &quot;muddled&quot;.
<br>
<p>But the facts are that the decision itself stands up remarkably
<br>
well to detailed analysis of the issues involved, and when we add
<br>
in all that we have learned about biology in the years since, it
<br>
can even seem prescient.  I doubt that my words here will persuade
<br>
any of those who are truly commited to either side of this debate,
<br>
but I believe I can at least show that the justices really did know
<br>
what they were doing, legally, morally, and biologically.
<br>
<p>First, let's make it clear what they really decided, since there is
<br>
confusion even over this.  In a recent episode of ABC's series
<br>
&quot;The Practice&quot;, for example, lawyer Eugene Young ridicules the
<br>
decision as &quot;nine men in robes making a decision for the rest of us&quot;.
<br>
But Mr. Young's tirade is 180 degrees from the truth.  The court did
<br>
not &quot;make the decision&quot; for everyone; they did exactly the opposite:
<br>
they said that the Texas legislature, despite being a group even
<br>
larger than the court and directly elected by the people of that
<br>
state, cannot make the decision for every woman in Texas.  But the
<br>
decision was a bit more complex than that.  They further divided
<br>
pregnancy into trimesters, and said that different rules apply to
<br>
each.  In the first, only the woman involved can decide for herself,
<br>
and no legislature or court can interfere; in the second, the state
<br>
can regulate to some degree; and in the third, the state can step in
<br>
and even ban abortion outright if it chooses.
<br>
<p>That three-part standard is what both sides complain about: those
<br>
who believe that all abortion is wrong don't like the court allowing
<br>
women that choice even in the first timester of pregnancy, and those
<br>
who favor absolute choice don't like the fact that the court let the
<br>
state step in before birth at all.  Both sides refuse to recognize
<br>
any substantive difference between a first-trimester pregnancy and
<br>
a third-trimester one as far as fundamental rights are concerned.
<br>
<p>So let's look at the issues involved, starting at the end: birth.
<br>
There is no question in our society that once a child has been born,
<br>
the umbilical cut and its lungs full of air, killing that child is
<br>
seen as a despicable crime.  There have certainly been societies
<br>
where that was not the case: infanticide was tolerated and even
<br>
common in some cultures, but not here.  Our culture, unlike many,
<br>
even assigns gender to infants: we call them little boys and little
<br>
girls from the moment of their birth, while most cultures only
<br>
separate men and women after puberty, treating all children as just
<br>
&quot;children&quot;.  Our attitudes are more in line with the facts.  The
<br>
qualities that we admire, even revere, about people that make us
<br>
revile harming them are just as evident in an infant as an adult:
<br>
people think, and feel, and dream, and laugh, and love, and want;
<br>
infants do as well. Infant boys and infant girls have different
<br>
skills and different personalities that can be observed and
<br>
measured right from birth.  Infants may not be be able to express
<br>
themselves as well as adults, but they clearly are /selves/,
<br>
thinking and feeling as whole people.  In the past people have
<br>
asserted that infants didn't feel pain, or never remembered events
<br>
from their infancy, but we now know these beliefs are false, and
<br>
that infants do feel pain and joy much as adults do, and their
<br>
adult lives are affected by events in infancy, and even by
<br>
experiences before their birth.
<br>
<p>The third-trimester rules of Roe acknowledge a simple biological
<br>
fact: that there is little fundamental difference in kind between
<br>
a child just before and just after birth.  Hospitals are full of
<br>
infants born weeks early, and while they may need a bit of
<br>
assistance from modern medical technology, we clearly think of them
<br>
as &quot;people&quot; in every important legal and ethical sense, and whether
<br>
they are in a womb or an incubator doesn't much affect that
<br>
evaluation: they have thoughts and feelings and experiences in
<br>
either case, and the thought of ending their lives bothers us.
<br>
There is a person there, and it is reasonable for a state to step
<br>
in and protect that person from harm.
<br>
<p>The picture at the beginning of pregnancy is very different.  It
<br>
begins with the event of conception, though &quot;event&quot; isn't really
<br>
the right word because even conception is a complicated process
<br>
in many stages that can be accomplished in many ways.  But for the
<br>
moment I'll concede the point.  Once the DNA from the egg and sperm
<br>
have combined, the newly-formed zygote then begins to divide into
<br>
two cells, four, eight, and so on.  At this point there aren't yet
<br>
any specialized cells: they're all stem cells, and will only take
<br>
on specialized roles as organs, nerves, and so on much later in
<br>
the process of development.
<br>
<p>The process of development itself can take many turns.  The
<br>
majority of the time, in fact, the process results in nothing at
<br>
all: most conceptions are simply flushed out with the mother's
<br>
next menstruation, and never develop, and the woman never knows
<br>
that any conception occurred at all.  In those fewer cases where
<br>
the zygote does make it through the tubes to implant in the
<br>
uterus, its fate is still undetermined.  It might develop into a
<br>
person, or two people, or three, or half.  Identical twins, for
<br>
example, result when the multi-celled zygote splits at some point,
<br>
and both portions go on to implant and develop into fully formed
<br>
unique people (albeit with identical DNA).  Identical triplets are
<br>
quite rare, but also possible.  Another even rarer possibility is
<br>
that two different zygotes will merge at some point in their
<br>
development, and develop into a single fully-formed person with
<br>
two sets of DNA.  These are called tetragametic chimeras, and are
<br>
often born with defects, but can also be born as perfectly normal
<br>
infants who may never know that they were the product of two
<br>
different conceptions.
<br>
<p>This is where the &quot;life begins at conception&quot; argument falls down:
<br>
yes, a zygote after conception is living, in the same sense that
<br>
any of our skin cells or liver cells is living. They can divide and
<br>
grow (indeed, we can now grow skin and muscle tissue in vitro from
<br>
a single cell), and contain a full set of genetic material.  But
<br>
the legal question is not whether the thing is living or not, or
<br>
even whether it is human.  The legal question is &quot;is it a person?&quot;,
<br>
in the sense of laws that make harming people an act of violence we
<br>
detest, or is it merely a collection of cells like the skin cells
<br>
we flush down the drain when we wash our hands, or blood cells that
<br>
we donate to the Red Cross?  What is it about people that makes
<br>
them specially deserving of such protection?  A good way to answer
<br>
that is to think of the twin case: why do we consider twins to be
<br>
two people, not one?  It's simple: each twin thinks and feels and
<br>
dreams independently.  Each has its own personality and its own
<br>
desires and fears.  It is untenable to argue that the single zygote
<br>
that would later develop into these two people had any of those
<br>
qualities: it has no brain, no nerves, no eyes, no ears.  It had
<br>
only the potential for developing those things--and we don't know
<br>
yet from the zygote stage exactly what it might develop into.  It
<br>
might become a person, or two, or half, or it might not.
<br>
<p>Likewise, there is nothing special about the type of cell that is
<br>
the zygote.  We retain stem cells even into adulthood, and any of
<br>
them also has the potential to develop into any other kind of cell.
<br>
The day is not far off--if it hasn't happened already--when a single
<br>
cell from an adult human will be able to produce a cloned person,
<br>
just as Dolly the sheep was created from a cell of her mother.
<br>
Clearly, it would be morally repugnant not to grant that person the
<br>
same legal rights as other people, because she will have the same
<br>
thoughts and feelings as any other infant, despite the fact that she
<br>
was not the product of conception at all.  Whether or not you
<br>
approve of cloning, the fact is that it demonstrates vividly the
<br>
fact that the concept of one-conception-one-person doesn't fly.
<br>
<p>So the first trimester rules of Roe also reflect what we know about
<br>
biology: a few cells don't make a person, and it doesn't make sense
<br>
to arbitrarily grant them the rights of a person when we don't even
<br>
yet know what they may develop into.  The mother, on the other hand,
<br>
is quite clearly a person, and her rights can and should be
<br>
protected.  Laws against birth control, &quot;morning after&quot; pills, and
<br>
yes, even first-trimester abortion clearly do victimize real women,
<br>
and we simply can't legally or ethically justify that to protect
<br>
what is clearly not a person.
<br>
<p>Lastly, there's the middle ground: the second trimester.  The
<br>
justices here make another wise statement: we don't know.  At this
<br>
point in the development of what's now a fetus, it begins to resemble
<br>
a person.  Twins have already split, chimeras have already joined,
<br>
and it begins to develop a brain and eyes and ears.  It might have
<br>
the beginnings of something like thoughts and feelings, or it might
<br>
not--we just don't know.  And because we don't know, the justices
<br>
leave the issue for further debate by the people's representatives.
<br>
<p>In short, the justices in Roe weighed the legal and biological
<br>
facts before them, and reached the right decision, despite the
<br>
fact that they had to decide decades before some of the biology I
<br>
mention above was known.  I for one find that remarkable and
<br>
worthy of praise.
