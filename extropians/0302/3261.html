<em>&gt; &gt; I've never read in a history book of an invaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; land...and I mean close enough proximity to see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where people were holding a peace protest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not scrambling for their lives.  Am I wrong?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Athens in the Peloponnesian War:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While Spartan forces were marauding the countryside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around Athens, the asshole Socrates and others were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying everything pro-Sparta that they could think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of.  A certain playwright was advocating peace and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disarmament in his theatrical productions.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I stand corrected.  Any good references, or
<br>
details on this event?  I didn't study really any
<br>
ancient Greecian history, but as I recall Socrates
<br>
didn't write any books, and his followers only
<br>
documented things in their aftermaths.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The worst crime of it was that a number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were listening to Socrates, and applauding those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productions, and this at a time when Spartan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tyranny was well-known.  So next time some loony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leftist seems to be going beyond all reason, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember that so did &quot;the wisest of them all&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>the wisest of all leftists, or the wisest of all
<br>
humans?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Alas, some people's emotions, healthy prejudices,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and natural human common sense are simply broken.
</em><br>
<p>Well, actually he didn't die until a later trial which
<br>
even then he could have chosen to flee rather than
<br>
become an intellectual martyr, so until I find out
<br>
more of his motives, and the scenario, I can't say for
<br>
certain that Socrates common sense was really broken.
