<em>&gt; <a href="mailto:rms2g@virginia.edu?Subject=RE:%20Hydrogen%20as%20SCAM?">rms2g@virginia.edu</a> writes: The main challenges to nuclear power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (aside from irrational fears of the greens) are terrorism and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that the peaceful nuclear technologies can be easily subverted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for weapon production.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rafal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I seem to remember that in the late 60s Herman Kahn wrote a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book called The Next Two Hundred Years.  As I recall he predicted a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular peak population of about 15 to 25 billion in the year 2176
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AD.  He also assumed the per capita use of energy would continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growing at the same rate as it has in modern America and would spread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the rest of the world's population on the same basis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        He then made various predictions as to whether or not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth could be made to produce the necessary amount of food and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where withal without resort to resources from space.  As I recall he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felt that the Earth could sustain us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        However, I remember distinctly that when he looked at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; availability of nuclear material he calculated that energy from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear sources was entirely too limited to become much more than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secondary source of energy. I seem to remember that he thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear energy was just a passing thing. The ore supply isn't there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        as far as he could tell at that time. I am getting into this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion late but has Kahn's viewpoint been discussed?
</em><br>
<p>### AFAIK, nuclear fission could sustain our civilization for hundreds if
<br>
not thousands of years - there is a huge amount of thorium, which can be
<br>
used with some modifications of current technologies, the usefulness of
<br>
uranium can greatly multiplied with breeder reactors (I know, they are
<br>
expensive and fault-prone, but I am merely describing the technical
<br>
possibilities, not the optimal solutions), so if we really wanted, we could
<br>
have a 100% nuclear economy.
