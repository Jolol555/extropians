Long time member of ExI Council of Advisors, our great friend and cohort in 
<br>
futurism, Bart Kosko is on Art Bell. Check it out!

Recap:
<br>
Bart Kosko (website), a professor at USC and expert in fuzzy logic, was the 
<br>
guest on Monday night. Defining fuzzy logic as a &quot;branch of machine 
<br>
intelligence that tries to get computers to think like people think,&quot; Kosko 
<br>
estimated that between 2015-2020 computers' processing power will equal or 
<br>
exceed the human brain's.
<br>
<p>Kosko said the 20th Century was about bringing the brain to the computer 
<br>
chip, but that our new century will reverse the process and we will 
<br>
introduce the chip to the brain. This will create possibilities for linking 
<br>
neural networks that could facilitate new types of communication and art 
<br>
forms that we can scarcely imagine now. In the nearer future Kosko 
<br>
postulated intelligent agents that can advise or console us...cont.
<br>
<p>Your New Brain is (Almost) Ready
<br>
Dr. Bart Kosko, the author of such books as Heaven in a Chip has pondered 
<br>
what the future may hold for our species. In a symposium on the TV program 
<br>
Closer to Truth, Kosko pointed out that while the human brain is a marvel 
<br>
of natural biology, it has certain limitations. &quot;We'll be re-engineering 
<br>
the brain a piece at a time, initially with implants and other supplements 
<br>
and ultimately engineering an outright replacement,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Kosko sees our evolution going in the direction of transferring our 
<br>
consciousness into increasingly advanced computer chips which would allow 
<br>
people to live theoretically forever. &quot;Just take the example of your past,&quot; 
<br>
he said. &quot;You can't remember a great deal of what you did three years ago. 
<br>
But if you had the detailed richness of that experience wholly embedded in 
<br>
a chip, you could not only relive it at will, you could edit it...cont.
