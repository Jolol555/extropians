<p>Yep, he means it.  A lot of people do.  They forget that you 
<br>
cannot &quot;wipe the world clean of their type&quot; without wiping it of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;yourself because you become exactly like that you abhor in 
<br>
such a campaign.  Without a clear and present real, not 
<br>
hypothesized, danger the US IS the aggressor if it attacks.

</em><br>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&lt;smirk&gt;  The world could use more real pacifists who think of

every possible solution and actually manage to practice some

real compassion rather than excusing violence as being &quot;for the

good of the Iraqi people&quot;.

<p><em>&gt;  If I should survive the global clean sweeping he has in mind, any pacifist

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If the world survives you can come visit me in the next room any 
<br>
time you like.  We can compare delusions of hope, peace and 
<br>
global prosperity and well-being.  We can get really 
<br>
out-of-our-minds crazy and talk about a glorious future where 
<br>
humans transcended their slightly evolved monkey state and 
<br>
prospered beyond any decent person's dreams.
