<p><em>&gt; What happened sixty years ago is in more than one way incomparable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we see today.
</em><br>
<p>Peace and war are very complex matter. We can understand it only when we
<br>
study the past, not the present or future.  And I know from the past that
<br>
nothing to do in complicated causal (social and political) enviroments is
<br>
very bad strategy.  Peace in 1933 - 1940 meant the catastrophe; it meant
<br>
very big war later.
<br>
Another analogy: Jews in WWII and now are in the same situation! When
<br>
US/West will not act Saddam will do the Second Holocaust. You doubt about
<br>
it?  Every peace activiste must know it.
<br>
OK, we know peacefull resistance, like Gandi. Just do it! But I think that
<br>
all &quot;Gandis&quot; in Iraq are allready dead. Analogy: I can't imagine, that Gandi
<br>
could win against Hitler. In such cases the US Army is better.
<br>
Conclusion: Our moral systems need knowledge, a.o. history,  to function
<br>
properly. I think we all want peace but universe is the computer and we must
<br>
calculate and act to reach it.
<br>
<p>And while Saddam Hussein surely is one of the worst
<br>
<em>&gt; dictators on this planet today, it's another game to cooly calculate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of deaths just for the risk of more terrorism and more chaos in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a region full of political complexity.
</em><br>
<p>OK, it is the question. But I think it is for the risk of more democracy,
<br>
more safaty, more extropy....
<br>
I hope Saddam Hussein will be one of the latest dictators on this planet.
<br>
The Others will not be so activ after his Fall . What we didn't know from
<br>
the past are new technologies/wmd in hands of dictators. Dictators + WMD = ?
<br>
But remember Fermi Paradox. We should be proactiv, help to build democracy
<br>
in
<br>
the muslim world and China, reconstruct UN towards World Republic, etc.
<br>
Peace is possible among democratic states.  Not till then can we use
<br>
technology safely to enhance homo sapiens. We can't build the extropy/future
<br>
when we haven't democracy everywhere. Don't cry for dictators!
