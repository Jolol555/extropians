<p>A common misconception among isolates.  I've heard legends about 
<br>
information that's supposedly &quot;not online&quot;, but have never managed to 
<br>
locate any myself.  I've concluded that this is merely a rationalization 
<br>
for inadequate search skills; isolates can't find some piece of 
<br>
information and so they conclude it's &quot;not online&quot;, which any diligent 
<br>
epistemological scrutiny easily shows to be a nonsensical conception.  If 
<br>
information exists it is necessarily online somewhere.  The URL, Uniform 
<br>
Resource Locator, is precisely that; uniform.  Anything which cannot be 
<br>
located by a URL is, by definition, not a resource.
<br>
<p>Thus, when isolates say that finding certain information is &quot;impossible&quot; 
<br>
if you &quot;don't know the proper terms&quot;, they betray a poor epistemological 
<br>
grounding; &quot;finding information&quot; is in fact *synonymous* with discovering 
<br>
the proper Google search terms for that information.  As for claiming that 
<br>
Google is an &quot;assistant to classical learning and knowledge&quot;, this ignores 
<br>
the fact that all classical learning and knowledge is available through 
<br>
Google.  (By definition; anything that is not only *not found* on Google 
<br>
but *not findable* through Google, even in principle, is not &quot;knowledge&quot;.) 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, much other information, such as online webcomics and today's 
<br>
weather, is available through Google, yet not a part of classical learning 
<br>
and knowledge.  Thus, classical learning, insofar as it is &quot;learning&quot; at 
<br>
all rather than random noise, is not an assistant to Google, but merely a 
<br>
subpart of it.
<br>
<p>The notion of &quot;supergoogular&quot; information is not only empirically 
<br>
unverified but epistemologically nonsensical, with the only conceivable 
<br>
interpretation being information which can only be googled using special 
<br>
keywords.  No such keywords having ever been provided, we can conclude 
<br>
that so-called supergoogular phenomena are fantasies concocted by isolates 
<br>
to cover their resentment of superior Google skills.
