<p><em>&gt; I just read this very informative, readable paper by Francis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heylighen which introduced me to the term &quot;ephemeralization&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>The essay, <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Info-Overload.pdf">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Info-Overload.pdf</a>
<br>
I find to be extremely well-written, though haven't finished
<br>
it. The concepts and imagery he introduces are also extremely
<br>
apt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm curious if any of you likewise see the described side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects - information overload, socio-institutional inertia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased unpredictability etc., as phenomena likely to delay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity?
</em><br>
<p>I'll keep that in mind as I continue reading.  I do, however,
<br>
question one item in the first paragraph.

<p>Heylighen writes
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosive development of the Internet and related
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information and communication technologies has brought
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into focus the problems of information overload, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the growing speed and complexity of developments in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;society.  People find it ever more difficult to cope
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with all the new information they receive, constant
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changes in the organizations and technologies they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use, and increasingly complex and unpredictable side-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effects of their actions.  This leads to growing stress
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and anxiety, fuels various gloom and doom scenarios about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the future of our planet, and may help explain the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increasingly radical movements against globalization.
<br>
<p>While he makes a crystal-clear presentation (later) of the
<br>
complexity and unpredictableness of those &quot;side-effects&quot;,
<br>
I would like to know if the &quot;growing stress and anxiety&quot;
<br>
is really symptomatic of our world at all.
<br>
<p>The people I'm around---even the people I listen to on
<br>
radio or read on this list---do *not* seem to be getting
<br>
more edgy or exhibit symptoms of growing anxiety.  But,
<br>
then, I've not been laid-off lately like many others
<br>
here in silicon valley, and in fact in the last months I've
<br>
been quite happy.  So maybe I'm really just not seeing it.
<br>
<p>I would appreciate anyone else's sense of the accuracy of
<br>
those introductory remarks.
<br>
<p>Thanks, Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know some will say an SI would transcend such side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects - but the near term development of a SI might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not?  Also, I see these problems as sure to manifest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an ever increasing techno-backlash as more and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are swayed by the (untenable) luddite appeal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a return to &quot;simpler times&quot;.
