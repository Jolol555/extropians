<br>
<p>INTRODUCTION
<br>
<p>Within the scientific community, as well as in the popular press and 
<br>
among science fiction writers, there has long been a concern with 
<br>
Extraterrestrials and the possibility of communication with them.  
<br>
This concern has led to such projects as the Search for 
<br>
Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) (Morrison, et al. 1977) that 
<br>
continues to be a focus of attention for many scientists even though 
<br>
currently facing reduced funding (Harrison and Elms 1990, Raybeck 
<br>
1992).  As recently as this year, Harrison published an intriguing 
<br>
paper concerning Extraterrestrial intelligence in one of psychology's 
<br>
major journals (Harrison 1993).  At the same time, scientists have 
<br>
theorized and speculated about the nature of Extraterrestrial 
<br>
intelligence and the problems involved in inter-sapient communication 
<br>
(Sagan 1973).  The general consensus has been that the universe is 
<br>
very likely to host other intelligent beings, that some of these will 
<br>
be more technologically advanced than current humanity, and that some 
<br>
will be trying to locate other intelligences.
<br>
<p>In the science fiction community, images of Extraterrestrials have 
<br>
been variegated in form, in intelligence and in intentions.  They 
<br>
range form the beneficent aliens of Julian May, who only wish to 
<br>
elevate the lot of humanity and facilitate our participation in an 
<br>
intergalactic &quot;milieu,&quot; (1987a, 1987b) to the malevolent 
<br>
Extraterrestrials of Greg Bear, who travel about the universe 
<br>
locating intelligent life forms and destroying them because they may 
<br>
be potential future competitors (1987).  Generally, however, images 
<br>
of aliens in the popular press and among the scientific community are 
<br>
positive.  It is widely believed that if a sapient form can achieve 
<br>
the degree of civilization necessary to support inter-stellar 
<br>
communication, it is unlikely to be characterized by hostile 
<br>
intentions.
<br>
<p>In this paper, I wish to examine this assumption.  As an 
<br>
anthropologist, I am aware that there are some markedly different 
<br>
paths to the evolution of intelligence.  These differences can provide 
<br>
us with models that can suggest some of the variety we may anticipate 
<br>
among Extraterrestrials.  I am concerned about the possibility that a 
<br>
technologically oriented intelligence may as likely be developed by a 
<br>
predatory species as by a non-predatory one.  I am particularly 
<br>
concerned with the kinds of stimuli that promote 
<br>
the development of intelligence, and with what sorts of ethical 
<br>
notions might be associated with these varying modes of evolving 
<br>
intelligence.  This exercise in modeling should have consequences for 
<br>
how we approach the possibility of Extraterrestrial communication.
<br>
<p>THE CASE FOR INTELLIGENCE
<br>
<p>Among the range of definitions for intelligence, one that is widely 
<br>
accepted is the ability to learn new response patterns (Jerison 
<br>
1973).  Generally, intelligence confers upon an organism greater 
<br>
adaptability and flexibility in dealing with environmental 
<br>
challenges.  However, many complex adaptations to the environment do 
<br>
not require the classical concept of intelligence.  Scientists have 
<br>
long known that insects are capable of complex adaptations to their 
<br>
<p>environments in a fashion that relies upon genetic programming rather 
<br>
than on learning (Wilson 1980).  Indeed, Schull has recently argued 
<br>
that even the adaptive characteristics of plant and animal species 
<br>
are related to information-processing and that it would be fruitful 
<br>
to view such species as intelligent (1990).  Overwhelmingly, however, 
<br>
the scientific community is persuaded that a greater capacity for 
<br>
learning is a superior adaptation to suggested alternatives.  
<br>
<p>In the evolution of intelligence on earth there has been a consistent 
<br>
trend from relatively closed instinctive patterns toward &quot;open&quot; 
<br>
learning.  (Hinde 1974, Sluckin 1965).  Jastrow has noted the 
<br>
evolution of intelligence from lower organisms to humanity and to 
<br>
computers (1981).  He and others believe that, if one has competing 
<br>
species, the evolution of intelligence is inevitable because the the 
<br>
advantages it confers upon the possessor (Itzkoff 1983, Sagan 1977).  
<br>
However, the questions concerning the rate at which intelligence is 
<br>
developed and the nature of the species that are most likely to 
<br>
possess it are more complex.
<br>
<p>Evolutionary theorists and developmental biologists have long been 
<br>
aware that the development of intelligence involves a series of 
<br>
interactions between organisms and their environment (Laughlin and 
<br>
Brady 1978, Laughlin and D'Aquili 1974, Manosevetz, et al. 1969, 
<br>
Mazur and Robertson 1972, Tunnell 1973).  The environment must 
<br>
contain conditions for which intelligence is an adaptive trait.  
<br>
Beings with greater intelligence then reproduce in increasing 
<br>
numbers, filling their eco-niches and driving out less intelligent 
<br>
competitors.  It is important to note, however, that the entities 
<br>
disadvantaged in this scenario are the ones that either compete 
<br>
directly with our intelligent others or are directly exploited by 
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>Complex environments select for intelligence by creating conditions 
<br>
where more intelligent competitors have an advantage in exploiting 
<br>
limited resources (Evans and Schmidt 1990, Robinson 1990).  Animals 
<br>
that proceed by instinct have a limited set of behavioral repertoires 
<br>
with which to respond to changing conditions.  They are limited not 
<br>
only by their physiology, but by their ability to perceive the 
<br>
existence of new demands and new resource possibilities.  Their 
<br>
coping equipment is genetically based and suited to the parameters of 
<br>
the environment in which the organism evolved.  Should that 
<br>
environment change, the organism may likely prove unable to adapt to 
<br>
the new circumstances and be seriously disadvantaged in its 
<br>
competition with other species.  (Daly and Wilson 1978, Dawkins 1976, 
<br>
Smith 1984).
<br>
<p>Generally, increasing intelligence confers upon an organism a better 
<br>
opportunity to model the environment, both natural and behavioral, so 
<br>
that food getting, mating and general survival strategies can be 
<br>
maximized.  Intelligence is selected for because it benefits the 
<br>
possessor, not because it is helpful to others.  
<br>
<p>Costs and Advantages of Intelligence
<br>
An increase in intelligence has meant a corresponding rise in brain 
<br>
size. As Jerison has noted, &quot;The mass of neural tissue controlling a 
<br>
particular function is appropriate to the amount of information 
<br>
processing involved in performing the function&quot; (1973: 8).  This has 
<br>
been true in organic evolution, and in the evolution of artificial 
<br>
intelligence as well (Gardner 1985, Goldstein and Papert 1977, 
<br>
Jastrow 1981, Llinas 1990, Nelson and Bower 1990, Schank and Childers 
<br>
1984).  It seems likely that, however information is processed, it 
<br>
would also be true for Extraterrestrials.  
<br>
<p>Intelligence is not without certain physical costs.  Particularly in 
<br>
<p>the case of high mammals, intelligence has been found to be expensive 
<br>
in terms of the body's resources.  Brain tissue requires large 
<br>
supplies of glucose and oxygen (Milton 1988), but these are justified 
<br>
by the advantages that intelligence confers.  Indeed, the costs of 
<br>
intelligence are evidence of its importance and success as an 
<br>
environmental adaptation.
<br>
<p>There are also social consequences that accompany the development of 
<br>
significant intelligence.  An increasing reliance on a learned 
<br>
repertoire implies an increased period of dependency on the part of the 
<br>
young.  The need for learning plus the problems of rearing 
<br>
learning-based offspring involve a very serious cost from an 
<br>
evolutionary perspective.  Such organisms have few offspring and this 
<br>
means that, unlike lower organisms that reproduce in greater numbers,  
<br>
the survival of each of these offspring is important.  This longer 
<br>
maturation period and the need for security creates a trend toward 
<br>
social living, as the infant and its mother are in need of the 
<br>
support of others (Laughlin and D'Aquili 1974).  This model is not 
<br>
only true for humans but also apes, cetaceans, elephants, and most 
<br>
other mammals with appreciable intelligence.   Further, as we shall 
<br>
see, the exigencies of social life can prove to be as strong a 
<br>
stimulus for the evolution of increased intelligence, as any other 
<br>
factor.  This creates a positive feedback loop in which intelligence 
<br>
promotes social living which, once established, makes increased 
<br>
intelligence highly adaptive. 
<br>
<p>Even among lower animals, greater intelligence means more flexibility 
<br>
in dealing with environmental conditions.  For predators this implies 
<br>
a greater ability to locate and consume prey, while, for prey, 
<br>
greater intelligence increases the likelihood of avoiding such a fate 
<br>
(Byrne and Whiten 1988).  
<br>
<p>As intelligence increases, other emergent properties appear which 
<br>
reflect the expanded complexity of the system, and which confer still 
<br>
greater advantages upon the possessor.  At some point, increasing 
<br>
intelligence should lead to self-awareness (Itzkoff 1985, Jastrow 
<br>
1981, Laughlin and D'Aquili 1974).  An organism equipped with self- 
<br>
awareness  can model not only the externals of the environment, but 
<br>
can now include itself as an element of attention.  It has a self- 
<br>
concept separable from the environment and capable of conscious 
<br>
examination and reflection (Tunnell 1973).  Concurrent with such a 
<br>
development is an increase in the organism's ability to construct an 
<br>
internal environment that can not only represent the external world, 
<br>
but also make possible the construction of symbols which are, by 
<br>
definition, arbitrarily related to their referents (Gazzaniga 1992, 
<br>
Laughlin and D'Aquili 1974, Laughlin, et al. 1990).  
<br>
<p>The capacity for symbolism represents an enormous evolutionary 
<br>
advantage for any intelligent species.  Prior to its appearance, 
<br>
communications are limited by environmental stimuli in what is termed 
<br>
a &quot;closed&quot; system (Hockett 1973).  In such circumstances, an organism 
<br>
emits a signal that is automatically called forth by an external 
<br>
stimulus.  There is no displacement in time or space, and such calls 
<br>
are generally mutually exclusive.  The information carrying capacity 
<br>
of the system is thus limited to the number of calls hard-wired into 
<br>
the organism.   With symbolism, organisms gain the ability to 
<br>
displace their messages and to combine them in ever more complex and 
<br>
novel assemblages.  Further, they can assign meanings in complex ways 
<br>
influenced, but not dictated, by biology.  This opens up the realm of 
<br>
culture, a learned set of patterns for behavior that are far more 
<br>
malleable than the biological substrate that made them possible.  
<br>
<p><p>While symbolism involves greatly increased freedom from the 
<br>
constraints of the organism's biological limitations, this freedom is 
<br>
not absolute.  For humans, the structure of our brain imposes limits 
<br>
both on the amount of information we can process at any given time 
<br>
(Miller 1956, Miller 1951), and on the kinds of information we can 
<br>
process (Ardila and Ostrosky-Solis 1989, Jerison 1990, Lenneberg 
<br>
1967, Thompson and Green 1982).  There is reason to believe that 
<br>
similar limitations and perceptual dispositions  would attend any 
<br>
evolving sentience (Gazzaniga 1992, Sauer and MacNair 1983, Stokoe 
<br>
1989, Wasserman 1989).  Given such an expectation, it seems likely 
<br>
that sentients who have evolved from a predator background would 
<br>
differ markedly from sentients whose gustatory preference run to 
<br>
plants.
