<em>&gt;     &gt;Frankly, Saddam as such is none of our business. [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;We would save a LOT more lifes if we dropped the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;sanctions tomorrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I must be the only member of this list who doesn't know if this war is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good idea or not. I do know there are valid reasons to be very nervous about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it but you haven't addressed any of them. Consider what you wrote above:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, I have addressed the so-called reason ad naseum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The sanctions started 12 years ago when Saddam invaded Kuwait, in the 6
</em><br>
<em>&gt; months after that before the first war started many people (and you too I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be willing to bet money on) said there should be no war because sanctions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would work and make him leave Kuwait. Give sanctions a chance they said,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and now these same people say there shouldn't even be sanctions.
</em><br>
<p>As I and others have pointed out, the so-called Kuwaiti invasion 
<br>
was greatly inflated and partially a setup by America.  We 
<br>
pretty much told Saddam that it was alright to take some action 
<br>
against Kuwaiti violations the week before.  We then inflated 
<br>
what was going on and faked (as later came out) satellite 
<br>
evidence of a massive Iraqi Army maneuvering to also invade 
<br>
Saudi Arabia.  We faked such emotional tear=jerkers as the 
<br>
testimony before the Senate of Iraqi soldiers barging into a 
<br>
hospital and taking babies out of an incubator and throwing them 
<br>
to the floor.  Faked it at just the right time to ok the 
<br>
agressions we already have planned.  Since then we have not only 
<br>
imposed sanctions that are quite ruinous to the well-being of 
<br>
the Iraqi people.  The US and Britain have unilaterally imposed 
<br>
no-fly zones and conducted bombing runs on various manufacturing 
<br>
centers on the grounds that perhaps they could somehow be used 
<br>
for producing weapons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As dangerous as Saddam is now just imagine if that advise had been followed,
</em><br>
<p>Saddam is far less dangerous than Israel or North Korea or even 
<br>
Pakistan.  He is orders of magnitude less dangerous to world 
<br>
peace than the only superpower that now claims the right to 
<br>
unilaterally bomb anyone and anything preemptively that it 
<br>
thinks might perhaps be a threat.  Get serious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; today he'd still be in Kuwait and because he saw how easy it was he'd almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly have annexed Saudi Arabia too. 
</em><br>
<p>Again, there is no proof he had ever any such intention or the 
<br>
means to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If that had happened Saddam would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have his hand on the throttle of the world economy by controlling the price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of oil.
</em><br>
<p>As opposed to us first invading and occupying Iraq to our 
<br>
satisfaction and financial gain and then finding ample reason to 
<br>
do the same with our former &quot;friends&quot; in Saudi Arabia?  The 
<br>
difference is, we are quite capable of doing it and have 
<br>
expressed intentions in that direction.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; He'd also be about a trillion dollars richer than he is today, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he wouldn't be spending all that money on hospitals and candy for little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kids I can tell you that. It doesn't sound like a world I'd like to live in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that's why Saddam is my business.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>As opposed to what we propose to spend trillions on?  Let us 
<br>
address the friggin' beam in our own eye once in a great while 
<br>
before beating our chests over some little splinter like Saddam.
<br>
<p>Really.
