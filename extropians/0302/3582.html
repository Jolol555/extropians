<p>
What is the Party of Citizens.  Is this just a single vocal
<br>
anti-American trying to make himself sound more important than he really
<br>
is, an Al-Qaida Public Relations cell, or a legitimite political
<br>
organization?
<br>
<p>After a web search I did find a reference to political party in
<br>
Vancouver.  It was a one page address essentially stating that they were
<br>
a political party.  Is this the same one?
<br>
<p>How many members are in the party?
<br>
<p>What does the party stand for other than disliking the United States?  
<br>
<p>When reading a posting such as this it helps to understand the source
<br>
and what their full agenda is.
<br>
<p>What has been pointed out previously on this list is that as soon as the
<br>
US pulls back their troops.
<br>
Sadam will once again cease to cooperate with or expel the inspectors.
<br>
Will Canada then who relies almost entirely on the US for it's defense
<br>
pay to redeploy troops to the gulf in the event that happens?
<br>

<p><p><p>U-S-A suffers from delusions of grandeur. Western Europe is a larger
<br>
economic unit than U-S-A. The world without U-S-A makes everything it
<br>
needs from paper clips to rockets which take us into space. U-S-A is
<br>
Canada's biggest trading partner but if U-S-A were to drop into a black
<br>
hole in space tomorrow, Canada would suffer economically for only a few
<br>
years as it can trade quite well with Asia (another economic bloc as big
<br>
as U-S-A) and Europe. Also Canada is bigger in area than our neighbour
<br>
to the south and would quickly become the &quot;New West&quot;.
<br>
<p>Right now, El Moron is frightening, if not terrorising the world with
<br>
his war-mongering evil-doer ways. As long as the UN maintains a strong
<br>
presence in Iraq, there is no threat of war with Iraq's neighbours. UN
<br>
peacekeepers have stayed for decades in other parts of the world. Why
<br>
not Iraq? How should the UN pay for the peacekeepers? By selling enough
<br>
Iraqi oil. If the UN force costs in the billions, so be it. Iraq will
<br>
pay and the peace will be maintained. There is no need for time limits
<br>
on Iraq. The most they have is a few box cars of biological and chemical
<br>
agents buried in the desert. Agents the use of which would be suicidal
<br>
as long as UN has a presence.
<br>
<p>El Moron is a terrorist thug who threatens to destabilize the Gulf
<br>
region and the world with a war which has UNKNOWN CONSEQUENCES (a point
<br>
raised by Madelaine Albright recently on CNN). Keeping the UN
<br>
peacekeepers there in place of El Moron's blood-lusting alternative has
<br>
KNOWN CONSEQUENCES, ie the consequences of PEACE.
<br>
<p>Yes we need a new resolution...a resolution for peace.
