<p>I have noticed over the years that Hollywood Incorporated
<br>
is very left leaning.  After Reagan left the biz, I cannot
<br>
name a politically conservative entertainer in television
<br>
or the movies.  Can You?
<br>
<p>There was a scene in S1mOne that makes me howl with
<br>
laughter every time I think of it.  Al Pacino is a
<br>
moviemaker, casts Winona Ryder, she goes to jail for
<br>
shoplifting, he uses instead a computer animated
<br>
woman, didnt tell anyone.  He makes her too perfect,
<br>
the proletariat clamors to meet her, so he devises a
<br>
scheme to ruin her career, make her so despised no one
<br>
will ever want to cast her, see any of her movies, etc.
<br>
<p>He has her do an interview where she spews a wickedly
<br>
funny scorching right wing canardic screed which
<br>
would make Rush Limbaugh blush.
<br>
<p>The great American proletariat react with stunning
<br>
enthusiasm.  Finally!  An actress who is a REAL PERSON!
<br>
<p>{8^D   HAAAAAAhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaa!
<br>
<p>Hilarious biting satire.
<br>
<p>Why did all the right wingers end up on the radio?
