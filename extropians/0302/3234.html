<p>But that's not the important part.  However these kinds of disclaimers
<br>
always puzzle me when the message is sent to a public mailing list.
<br>
I can't help worrying that I may be somehow violating the provision
<br>
and breaking the law.  Did Michael *really* intend me to read it?
<br>
Did he &quot;expressly state&quot; that the message was not confidential and was
<br>
unprivileged?  I didn't see anything like that.  The language seems a
<br>
bit unfriendly, threatening and heavy-handed.
<br>
<p>Anyway, he also asked about
<br>
<a href="http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/06news/NewsReleases/2001/NR-01-08-05.html">http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/06news/NewsReleases/2001/NR-01-08-05.html</a>:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From that paper - &quot;In other words, the X-ray irradiation did not decrease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time it takes for hafnium to decay; a result that Becker and the team
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim is consistent with nuclear physics&quot;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My knowledge is limited on this subject, but I was under the impression that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nucleons of Hafnium could be excited to higher energy levels and remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stable and coaxed to release their stored energy as gamma rays when hit with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; X rays.  The nucleonic excitation has nothing to do with the weak nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radioactive decay of the host atom.  So what does it matter that the LLNL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found that the X-Ray irradiation did not 'decrease the time it takes for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hafnium to decay&quot;  It shouldn't, it should, however, decrease the time it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes for the excited nucleons to decay to a non-excited state!  Did these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researches just misunderstand what was going on here?  Or am I just entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confused?
</em><br>
<p>I think all these uses of &quot;decay&quot; refer to the same phenomenon, the
<br>
decay from the excited state to the non-excited state.  Normally this
<br>
occurs very slowly, with a half-life of 31 years.  The claim is that
<br>
X-rays trigger the decay to happen quickly so that we get high energy
<br>
emissions.
<br>
<p>Re-read the article with the idea that whenever they talk about &quot;decay&quot;
<br>
they don't mean nuclear decay via alpha or beta emission to another
<br>
isotope, but rather emission of gamma radiation from an excited to an
<br>
unexcited nuclear state.  It is this form of decay which is supposed to
<br>
be accelerated by the X-rays and which LLNL did not observe.
<br>
<p>One possible explanation of the difference that occurs to me is that the
<br>
original report apparently used dental machine X-rays, while LLNL used
<br>
a third generation X-ray beam, their &quot;Advanced Photon Source&quot;, which
<br>
sounds pretty damn fancy, not to mention it's 100,000 times stronger.
<br>
Maybe differences in the triggering radiation could explain the different
<br>
results.
