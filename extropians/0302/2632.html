<em>&gt;### Subduction zones are geologically pretty unstable, and are covered with

How about reasonably deep burial (no need to be excessive), but vitrify 
<br>
it first.  If that doesn't seem sufficient, then embed the glass into 
<br>
asphalt, and bury that.  Leeching out of glass is slow, but leeching out 
<br>
of glass covered with asphalt would take???  If you're really paranoid, 
<br>
you could encase the whole thing in powdered plaster.  This would tend 
<br>
to keep any water that leaked in from leaking out.  My guess is that 
<br>
200' should be deep enough.  That way we can retreive it if we decide we 
<br>
need to.  Lots of the details about this could be argued, but even just 
<br>
as I said it, it should suffice.  The highly radioactive stuff only 
<br>
lasts a few years.  If the slightly radioactive stuff leaks out 
<br>
slowly... well, that's nothing new.  It's been doing that forever.
<br>
<p>That said, reasonable care is desireable.  It's just paranoia that 
<br>
isn't.  So make things as safe as is feasible, but don't worry about 
<br>
keeping things safe forever.
