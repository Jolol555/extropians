<p>Hmm, why do you think that? 
<br>
<p>What to look for is noise-amplifying processes, i.e. chaotic phenomena
<br>
or systems that very sensitively can move into two attractors (like a
<br>
GM counter or a neuron). Both are rather common in the world. Quantum
<br>
transitions likely color much of the thermal noise in our environment,
<br>
noise which in turn influences air movements and hence weather patterns
<br>
- here individual quantum 'choices' are invisible because there are so
<br>
thermodynamically many of them that we cannot make out any individual
<br>
contribution. But they would cause an ensemble of systems diverge with 
<br>
a speed set by their lyapunov coefficients.
<br>
<p>My guess is that the divergence is fairly steady most of the time, with 
<br>
occasional spikes. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (It's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting... I began this with a model of a continuum of universe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states, and have ended up much closer to the sheaves of similar 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes that are a stape of parallel worlds in science fiction.)
</em><br>
<p>Note that the MWI also contains the unlikely worlds, including truly
<br>
bizarre &quot;hell spaces&quot; where there is no order at all. But the
<br>
probability of finding onself in such a world is vanishingly small due
<br>
to decoherence, that leaves only the classically possible worlds with
<br>
much probability mass. So in one sense there is a continuum of worlds,
<br>
but only a tiny sheave matters - but this sheave on the other hand
<br>
contains many continuums (like the dimension 'where did the electron
<br>
end up?'). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A question might exist as to whether or not this differentiation is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantaneous, propagates at the speed of light, or perhaps propagates 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the speed of Wigner's paradox ... i.e., only with the transmission of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information.  OTOH, this may not be a meaningful question.  
</em><br>
<p>If you view the universe as a single state vector then there is no need 
<br>
for superluminal transmission or anything; the whole universe is a 
<br>
single object.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's not clear that it's possible, even in principle, to distinguish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between these variants.  Which is, itself, the major argument against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the multi-worlds hypothesis.  There's no obvious way to test it!
</em><br>
<p>Well, the MWI is a falsifiable hypothesis: if you ever observe
<br>
non-unitary evolution of quantum systems, it is out. So far it has not
<br>
been seen, not even with C60 'atoms'. 
<br>
<p>I think Tegmark explains it nicely in the paper that got this thread 
<br>
started.
