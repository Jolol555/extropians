<p>I see, but demonstrating that subways are the Luddite
<br>
and terrorist low hanging fruit is not necessarily
<br>
related to either 9-11 or Iraq.  The unabomber and
<br>
the KC bomber both predated 9-11-01 and the current
<br>
trouble with Iraq.  So I respectfully remove Iraq
<br>
from the subject line.
<br>
<p>I expect lone wolf home grown terrorists will be the
<br>
ones attacking the subways.  When I say home-grown,
<br>
I am not necessarily talking about Americans either
<br>
(altho both my examples were USian) since Europe has
<br>
more subways than the U.S. and Europe is more
<br>
dependent on them.
<br>
<p>Regarding Luddite attacks in the U.S. I could imagine
<br>
where two yahoos could arrange over the internet to
<br>
meet at a certain time going on the freeway in the
<br>
same direction using synchronized watches, drive parallel
<br>
for some distance, then in the middle of a tunnel of
<br>
some major artery, they would &quot;accidentally&quot; collide.
<br>
Most likely there would be no injuries, but the
<br>
disruption could be enormous, running into perhaps
<br>
millions of dollars with just an hour backup on a
<br>
major freeway.  Furthermore, the perps could get
<br>
away with it, for it would be impossible to prove
<br>
they had arranged the accident.  Insurance would
<br>
even cover the cost of it all.
<br>
<p>We have built a system that is so vulnerable it
<br>
almost invites obstructionists to destroy.  Humanity
<br>
needs to spread out.  spike
