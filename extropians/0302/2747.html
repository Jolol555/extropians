<p><em>&gt; For example lets take your 2D picture
</em><br>
<p>[the presumed part of one's visual cortex where indeed
<br>
a pattern has been found that corresponds to the visual
<br>
image one is looking at]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and look at the layer of neurons just in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; front of (closer to the center of the brain)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than where the scientists found the picture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the display.  I would argue that this layer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely represents the space just in front of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the monitor.
</em><br>
<p>Well, what is generally supposed is that the
<br>
areas closer to the center of the brain---
<br>
causally upward from the cruder level of the
<br>
sensory input---are where feature recognition
<br>
is performed.  The edges of a triangle, for
<br>
example, are abstracted.  This is the first
<br>
step along toward meaning taking by the brain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Of course since the space in front of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the monitor is empty the people observing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the monkeys brain wouldn't have noticed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything even if they were looking for something.)
</em><br>
<p>You stick to your 3D claim, of course, that
<br>
there is and must be a 3D faithful representation
<br>
right inside the brain.  I never have heard of
<br>
anyone in my life besides you who thinks so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But this is all of lesser importance to the fact that we experience a real 3D
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective space.  There is some way that our brain represents this subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space, even if it isn’t with actual voxel (3D pixel) neurons in the same 3D
</em><br>
<em>&gt; configuration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Well, again, the words can mean either thing.  It's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little bit like the puzzler &quot;do we see airplanes, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do we see the photons reflected off the airplanes?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I like to say that we see the airplanes, but I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what people mean when they say that we see photons.&lt;&lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Precisely.  The only thing that sees the airplane is the photons.  The only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing that sees the photons is the surface of our retina… and so on down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causal chain of perception.  It is physically impossible for us to be directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware of the airplane the way it SEEMS we do.
</em><br>
<p>I have suspected that you fail to grasp that most intelligent
<br>
people---or people who have given sense perception much
<br>
thought at all---find this exceedingly elementary.  Now,
<br>
yes, it's true that when I was eighteen this dawned on
<br>
me to the degree that I had an utter conviction that
<br>
most people didn't really understand that sense perceptions
<br>
come in from the outside and are handled entirely materialistically
<br>
by our brains.  So I used to try to emphasize this in diagrams
<br>
that I would show people.
<br>
<p>On the left part of the diagram I would show a circle
<br>
denoting someone's head, and then I'd draw their eye,
<br>
and show a tree on the right side of the diagram.  Then
<br>
I'd trace how the light rays would come from the tree
<br>
and cross over within the eye to create a representation
<br>
in the brain.  Just to be cute, I'd show the little tree
<br>
upside down inside the brain.
<br>
<p>But I have found since then that there seem to be just
<br>
two classes of people:  (a) those who understand that
<br>
already and have no need of such a lecture from me or (b)
<br>
those who could not care less about academic discussions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally all this cause and effect results in a subjectively 3D representation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the airplane with a subjective representation of ourselves looking out holes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in our skulls at it.  All of this subjective information being in our brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When we say &quot;we see the airplane&quot; this entire process is what this means.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must remember that cause and effect perception only goes one way.  It SEEMS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like we look out of the holes in our skulls through the windows of our eyes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see the airplane, but in reality the cause and effect of perception flows in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the opposite direction.  You have to think very carefully not to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrationally about this.
</em><br>
<p>This confirms my impression.  You still seem to be in the
<br>
grip of this being a profound idea, whereas I'm telling
<br>
you that to the people on this list this is entirely
<br>
commonplace.  I certainly *hope* that people here (and
<br>
elsewhere where you encounter people attending to these
<br>
issues) that the difference between object and sense-
<br>
datum, between appearance and reality, is already very
<br>
clear.
<br>
<p>Especially those of us who have known this for decades
<br>
do not &quot;have to think very carefully not to think
<br>
irrationally about this&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;What you need to stress---and you do---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that there is some kind of true-to-life model in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the brain, whereas I think that most people on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list believe that the representation of objects in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the brain is much more subtle, the encoding much, much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more obscure. &lt;&lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People tend to think this way when they aren’t thinking clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and rationally about how cause and effect perception works.
</em><br>
<p>You are so dead wrong here.  I don't know what your problem
<br>
is, but to imagine that the authors of innumerable books on
<br>
how vision works, brain scientists in general, and the vast
<br>
majority of people on this list who do not see it at all the
<br>
way you do are suffering from lack of clear thinking or
<br>
irrationality is outrageous.  Not at all, I dare say!  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People think that red is something on the airplane and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they think our brain doesn’t require anything like red
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to represent this.
</em><br>
<p>Oh dear.  The ultimate philosophical muddle has just been
<br>
raised---nothing is so difficult to discuss as color!  But
<br>
bravely Lee and Brent sally forth!  Ahem.  Okay, now you're
<br>
probably *not* wrong here, but the way I'd say it comes
<br>
out a lot different:  I say that there are two ways of
<br>
talking about it.
<br>
<p>A. &quot;Red paint is on the airplane&quot;, or &quot;the airplane is red&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider this quite defensible.  What the speaker means
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is that the airplane now reflects light of the appropriate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wavelength that anyone with normal human color vision will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testify that the airplane now has this property.  (And
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animals too, but that's harder to describe.)
<br>
<p>B. &quot;Wavelengths of certain frequencies are reflected by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the airplane, but its redness occurs only because
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the three types of cones---the type sensitive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to wavelengths between about 520 and 620 nanometers---
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fire and this signal is called &quot;redness&quot; by the higher
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level processes of the brain&quot;.  This is quite defensible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also, and may be preferable in a careful discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If people would just stop and think carefully about this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things become very clear, simple and obvious.
</em><br>
<p>You really have to stop deluding yourself about this.
<br>
I trust that you have studied a number of books on
<br>
how sense perception really works, and may I without
<br>
being presumptuous recommend another?  &quot;Eye, Brain,
<br>
and Vision&quot;, by David H. Hubel (a Scientific American
<br>
publication), is terrific.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When this happens you can finally realize what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future holds for our minds once we start effing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanding and sharing the conscious experience in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our brains.
</em><br>
<p>...finally realize...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once you realize all this you know how stupid
</em><br>
<p>...how stupid...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it is to think things like the Turing test will forever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the best tool we have to determine how conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another being is and so on.  I wish people on this list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science fiction writes, and people like Raymond Kurzweil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and most everyone else would stop being so foolish and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational in this way.
</em><br>
<p>...foolish and irrational...
<br>
<p>Well, Brent, aren't you getting a little well-seasoned
<br>
for such thoughts?  (I do appreciate your candor, however
<br>
---many think things like this but are too wary of really
<br>
coming out with it.)  Surely you're thirty, by now, aren't
<br>
you?
<br>
<p>(Like we used to say back in the sixties, never trust
<br>
anyone under thirty!)
