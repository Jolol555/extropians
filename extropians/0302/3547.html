<em>&gt; &gt; sometimes countries just do this, e.g., the U.S. is right

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, it is the UN and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which

</em><br>
<p>I stand corrected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Like North Korea, Iraq is trying to make the whole issue look like it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is being bullied by the US, when we are simply enforcing UN resolutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that date back to 1990, and to the cease fire agreement that Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signed in 1991 WITH THE UN.  It is not our fault if some countries are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral cowards and are sabotaging the effectiveness of the UN for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own commercial enrichment (i.e. France, Germany, and Russia in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business relations with Saddam).
</em><br>
<p>France and Germany could have secondary motives as well; moving
<br>
towards a united EU that would be a bigger player on the world
<br>
stage.  But if you are right about this---and I do recall reports
<br>
about France's being owed a lot of money by Hussein---then that
<br>
would be a primary motive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is not we who are throwing our weight around, it is France and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Germany that are doing so, trying to establish an imperial Europe under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their rule that has one rule: oppose or sabotage the US in any way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible and make a buck however they can.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, my way was another way of saying the same thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is France and Germany who are throwing their weight around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and destroying the international system for their own profit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They claim it is about oil, and they are right, oil that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to keep for themselves and for their own profit, at prices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will continue to lavishly finance their social welfare states.
</em><br>
<p>You have mentioned this intriguing hypothesis before.  But
<br>
if the worldwide price of oil fell following resumption
<br>
of Iraq's fields to full production, then countries financing
<br>
their welfare schemes through gas taxes could, I would think,
<br>
simply turn to their constituents and proclaim that although
<br>
the sales price was going down, taxes needed to be raised to
<br>
compensate.  What's wrong with that?
