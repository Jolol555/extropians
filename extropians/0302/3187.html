<em>&gt;&gt; Is it likely to enhance sex drive in normal healthy humans?
</em><br>
<p>Rafal answered:  &quot;don't know&quot;
<br>
<p>You should know Rafal that improved sex drive is a known side-effect of
<br>
many dopamine agonists in humans, as it is also with levodopa. From your
<br>
perspective it is listed as a &quot;side-effect.&quot; It should not be considered
<br>
unlikely by you then that a MAO-B inhibitor like selegiline, which
<br>
increases dopamine levels, would also increase sexual activity. The drug
<br>
works toward this end in a manner similar to the drug apomorphine
<br>
(Uprima), currently available in Europe for erectile dysfunction. Rather
<br>
than just working on the plumbing (like Viagra), apomorphine (Uprima)
<br>
actually stimulates dopaminergic neurons in the sex centers of the brain
<br>
in much the way as does selegiline. Apomorphine may be more selective
<br>
for this effect than selegiline, but they both work on the same
<br>
principle.
<br>
<p>I've already reported one study of this effect of selegiline in rats, in
<br>
which the animals enjoyed: 
<br>
<p>1) improved sexual ability, 
<br>
2) improved learning ability, and 
<br>
3) prolonged life-span. 
<br>
<p>Below is yet more evidence of sexual effects from another animal study:
<br>
<p>In this study below, young sexually active selegiline treated rats
<br>
enjoyed roughly *DOUBLE* the number of ejaculations compared to the rats
<br>
in the control group! 
<br>
<p>As in the previously mentioned study, they also learned better and lived
<br>
longer.

<p>ABSRACT:
<br>
Sexually low performing male rats die earlier than their high performing
<br>
peers and (-)deprenyl treatment eliminates this difference

<br>
<p>ABSTRACT 
<br>
<p>Out of 1600 sexually inexperienced 28-week old Wistar-Logan male rats 94
<br>
sexually inactive ('low performing', LP) and 99 highly active ('high
<br>
performing', HP) rats were selected.  The rats were treated from the 8th
<br>
month of their life three times a week, subcutaneously, with either 0.9%
<br>
NaCl or 0.25 mg/kg (-)deprenyl until they died. Their copulatory
<br>
activity was tested once a week and their learning performance was
<br>
measured in the shuttle box once in three months. The salt treated LP
<br>
rats (n = 44) never displayed ejaculation during their life time, they
<br>
were extremely dull in the shuttle box and lived 134.58 2.29 weeks.
<br>
Their (-)deprenyl-treated peers (n = 48) became sexually active, their
<br>
mating performance was substantially increased and lived 152.54 1.36
<br>
weeks, significantly longer than their salt-treated peers and as long as
<br>
the salt-treated HP rats.  The salt treated HP rats (n = 49) displayed
<br>
14.04 0.56 ejaculations during the first 36-week testing period and due
<br>
to aging they produced 2.47 0.23 ejaculations between the 73-108th week
<br>
of testing.  Their learning performance was high.  They displayed 78.45
<br>
3.01 conditioned avoidance responses (CAR) during the first 36-week
<br>
testing period and this dropped to 50.67 2.99 (p &lt; 0.01) during the
<br>
73-108th week of testing.  They lived 151.24 1.36 weeks, significantly
<br>
(p &lt; 0.001) longer than their LP peers.  The (-)deprenyl-treated HP rats
<br>
(n = 50) were sexually much more active than their salt-treated peers.
<br>
They displayed 30.04 0.85 ejaculations during the first 36-week testing
<br>
period and 7.40 0.32 ejaculations between the 73-108th week of testing.
<br>
Also their learning performance was substantially increased.  They
<br>
produced 113.98 3.23 CARs during the first 36-week-testing period and
<br>
81.68 2.14 CARs during the 73-108th week of testing.  They lived 185.30
<br>
1.96 weeks, significantly more than their salt-treated peers and out of
<br>
the 50 rats 17 lived longer than the estimated technical life span
<br>
(TLS).
