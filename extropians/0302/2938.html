<p>
It is to the best of my knowlege that the decisions of the UN and of each 
<br>
nation are still left up to a few people. The real questions should be of 
<br>
the poor logic of these people. However it is really just a &quot;hunch&quot; to 
<br>
understand why these people have chosen the position they do. Even with 
<br>
direct evidence it would be highly unlikely for an individual to sum up the 
<br>
opinions of one nations politicians. It is much more likely that the US 
<br>
choosing war or France choosing anti-war derives from irrational ideas of a 
<br>
few people. Then the media takes hold of the positions and propaganda 
<br>
flurishes. Before you know it you have two people argueing over wether 
<br>
France sold Iraq illegal weapons. To argue about something when niether 
<br>
party in the argument can give accurate information is futile. It would be 
<br>
like me trying to argue that two people on this lists I don't know but I 
<br>
heard from this third person are idiots. The argument is meaningless. The 
<br>
first question of an argument should be &quot;what are we hoping to solve&quot; it he 
<br>
awnser is nothing than what's the point.
