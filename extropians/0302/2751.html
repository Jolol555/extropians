<br>
<p>and here's a dismal but typical failure of imagination/understanding/nerve
<br>
from someone of whom we might have expected better:
<br>
<p>Matt Ridley
<br>
Author of Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters
<br>
One of the most far-reaching developments will be the discovery of the genes
<br>
that cause us to age.
<br>
<p>[yes]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Once we understand those genes, we will be able to counteract them.
<br>
<p>[surely]
<br>
<p>Then we will slow down the aging process dramatically.
<br>
<p>[slow down? that's like: breed really fast horses to pull our carts, right?]
<br>
<p>My great-grandchildren might live to 150 and not look very old at the end of
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>[150, eh. His *grand*children should live indefinitely, and not look very
<br>
human for very long. Maybe his children, or himself if he lives that long,
<br>
health and longevity improving incrementally]
<br>
<p>The social and economic consequences will be striking.
<br>
<p>[striking? that's like: new flint knapping techniques will improve our
<br>
axess]
<br>
<p>Careers would potentially go on forever,
<br>
<p>[careers? forever? good grief, what has happened to this man's fine brain?
<br>
that's like: flint knapping jobs will go on forever]
<br>
<p>and there's no particular reason why people should retire.
<br>
<p>[in 50 years, there should be no particular reason why people should or
<br>
could *work*, you ninny]
<br>
<p>People would delay having children in order to keep their career and mating
<br>
options open. If you could quite happily have your first child in your 50s
<br>
or 60s, a lot of people would do that, and population growth would start to
<br>
fall very rapidly.
<br>
<p>[well, yes, unless they have the technology to xox or upload themselves,
<br>
which might not be available by 2053, but don't bet on it]
<br>
