<p>Because until very recently, and perhaps even now, there has not

been a storage medium that could survive crash conditions that
<br>
could record a significant amount of video.  Videotape and probably
<br>
CD-RW or r-DVDs probably would not withstand any high temperature
<br>
conditions that might be encountered in a crash.
<br>
<p>I'm unsure what medium was used by older black boxes but the
<br>
newer ones are using solid state memory.

<p><em>&gt; I bet

</em><br>
<p>Escape pods have been proposed.  They could be introduced using
<br>
current technology.  The problem is they could only fit
<br>
4 or 5 of them in the the shuttle cockpit as currently designed.
<br>
They do add weight but it is primarily the reduction in crew
<br>
capacity that biased NASA against them.  NASA is also afraid
<br>
that they might fail under &quot;normal&quot; conditions (obviously they
<br>
need to be computer activated) and that would create more
<br>
problems than it might solve.
