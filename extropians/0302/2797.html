<p><em>&gt; I find it hard to believe that the liberal media myth hasn't been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoroughly deposed in a forum like the extropians list.  It's certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true that most _employees_ of the media are liberal-leaning, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations are owned, and the editorial decisions overseen and enforced,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by conservative media conglomerates.  ABC: Disney.  CNN: AOL/Time Warner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FOX: News Corp.  CBS: Viacom.  Liberally-biased?  Come on, now.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, it would be logical for the media to be biased
<br>
in whatever direction that their ownership is.
<br>
<p>Unless the ownership is enlightened enough to allow the
<br>
reporters a free hand.  The ownership is *primarily*
<br>
interested in making money, not in &quot;educating&quot; people,
<br>
a point that must be kept in mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The editorial agenda of all these media outlets is set by senior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; editorial and executive staff who report to Murdoch, Turner, and the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggressively conservative individuals in control of the media apparati.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The editorial staff themselves are, themselves, heavily conservatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biased.
</em><br>
<p>Have you really read the editorials of the major newspapers
<br>
in the U.S.?  (You may be right about the lesser newspapers.)
<br>
But that's not what we are talking about.  I thought we were
<br>
talking about the slant of the *news* articles, not the editorial
<br>
pages.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can't believe the liberal media fallacy stands up to the brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around here.
</em><br>
<p>I think that the most important thing that we've learned here
<br>
in the past year (I hope) is that it's definitely not a question
<br>
of brains.  Ideological differences run much deeper than that,
<br>
and it appalls me that people keep crying or thinking &quot;stupid!&quot;
<br>
when they read partisan opinions that differ from their own
<br>
partisan opinions.  :-)  Why can't you see that we ALL have
<br>
ideological blinders?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The ones who make up the famed &quot;liberal media,&quot; the working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stiffs in the trenches, covering the current stories, do exactly what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every other working stiff in the world does--make their bosses happy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and as I said, they make their bosses happy by doing their
<br>
jobs in an effective way, which means looking good on television,
<br>
or hiring competent employees to run their paper---and in the
<br>
case of liberal papers, to get higher status from other journalists.
<br>
See Ron H's remarks about the liberal ideologues that run the
<br>
journalism schools.
<br>
<p>But what you and I are debating, given our separate ideological
<br>
blinders, is who happens to be more blind in this case.  If it's
<br>
not you, and you say that the newspapers are conservatively
<br>
biased, then since I admit that the radio media are conservatively
<br>
biases, then you must not find much difference between them.  This
<br>
is surely easily seen by all to be contrary to fact.
