This is very interesting and pretty good.
<br>
<p>Add the following, which don't kill the idea, but augment it, and 
<br>
assume the orbiter's OMS capable of kicking it up to the station: 
<br>
Let's say they figured out on the 17th that something &quot;had to be 
<br>
done.&quot;
<br>
<p>1) Indeed, Columbia did not have a robot arm
<br>
2) Columbia was carrying two EVA suits. (I'll double check, but I 
<br>
think that's accurate)
<br>
3) The Spacehab RDM module is in Columbia's payload bay, and I am 
<br>
guessing that it could not be jettisoned - The port entrypoint on 
<br>
Columbia does not double as an airlock.
<br>
<p><p>The good part is that this plan does *not* involve parking Columbia 
<br>
on the ISS - no one should want to attach 232,700 pounds of 
<br>
deadweight to the station. Even if she could make it up the well that 
<br>
far, she'd bring the station down in a month without fuel to boost.
<br>
<p>Additionally, 3 people could have been back already, on the 
<br>
previously jettisoned Soyuez lifeboat in January, and up to three on 
<br>
the next one. Typically a shuttle can take three additional 
<br>
passengers on the second floor deck somehow (never saw the schematic) 
<br>
Bringing the total to 10.

<p><p><em>&gt;There are 2 airlocks on ISS -- one US and one Russian.  The pumpkin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suits are smaller than either the US IMU suit or the Russian Orlan suit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the airlocks are each designed to accommodate 2 astronauts suited
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for EVA and a good deal of equipment.  In the emergency situation we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;talking about, the pumpkin suits would be good enough to hold pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the transfer out the starboard side door of the shuttle.  Here's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mission profile:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- Columbia comes alongside and is grappled by the station's arm (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't know, but assume Columbia didn't have its arm fitted for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;SpaceLab mission).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- Columbia's crew begins shuttle power-down for on-orbit mothballing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indefinite duration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- Columbia's crew suits up in the pumpkin suits and goes on Columbia's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suit-supply air.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- ISS arm maneuvers Columbia as close to the Quest airlock on ISS as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible, with the starboard main shuttle door facing Quest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- 2 from ISS exit the Quest airlock and rig as many lines as possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around the passage between the two vehicles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- Columbia depressurizes and the two from ISS cycle three Columbia crew
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into Quest at a time (I'm sure it would hold three in pumpkin suits at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tight fit).  Columbia crew stay on air supplied from Columbia until it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their turn.  They're on suit air for max 20-30 minutes -- more like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;10-20.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- After the third cycle, the 2 from ISS do a minimal close-down of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Columbia's hatch, photo the damage on the left wing if there's time on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the EVA, disconnect safety lines and ingress Quest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Total EVA time &lt; 4 hours.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All assumes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1.  Sufficiently high-resolution pics of Columbia's left wing could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been taken to diagnose the problem to make this kind of wild decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2.  Columbia has enough delta-v to rendezvous with ISS.  (Note ISS has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some minimal on-board delta-v, and could have contributed slightly to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plane-matching manouver).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thereafter, Columbia's crew could be cycled down in Soyuzes over time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with resupply of ISS stepped up for the duration with Progress flights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If Columbia couldn't be salvaged, then the SpaceLab module could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been disconnected over time and incorporated into ISS, Columbia stripped
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and &quot;scuttled&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(An old salvage lawyer's mind at work, I guess ...)
