This is not just going on at Princeton and this idea is not his only
<br>
&quot;non-traditional&quot; idea.  Where I am currently enrolled, the professor who
<br>
teaches Medical Ethics has the EXACT same viewpoint and it is REQUIRED that
<br>
all nursing students take his class.  I am fortunate in that I had ethics
<br>
as part of my Associate Degree program and do not have to retake it for my
<br>
Bachelor's in Nursing.  My mother had to take his class a few years ago and
<br>
was failed because she dared to disagree with him.  She was able to appeal
<br>
and receive a B (she earned an A on all work).  It is VERY disturbing to me
<br>
that the next generation of nurses is being taught that infanticide of
<br>
&quot;imperfect&quot; children is acceptable, along with euthanasia and other things
<br>
you don't even want to think about.  Even more disturbing is that I see
<br>
this attitude starting to show in some of the younger generation of nurses.
<br>
I have heard colleagues express the same thing and even had one say when my
<br>
son was born that he should just be allowed to die because he would never
<br>
have a decent life.  What will happen to Peter Singer and others that think
<br>
as he does when they start to age and someone decides that their life is no
<br>
longer worth living?  Will they still hold to their sacred belief system?
