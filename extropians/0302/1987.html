I was reading Paul Johnson's &quot;A History of the American People&quot;
<br>
and he says on p. 236:
<br>
<p>&quot;The 'physical fallacy' is a belief that only those who worked with
<br>
their hands and brains to raise food or make goods were creating
<br>
'real' wealth and that all other forms of economic activity were
<br>
essentially parasitical.  It was commonly held in the early 19th
<br>
century, and Marx and all his followers fell victim to it.  Indeed
<br>
plenty of people hold it in one form or another today, and whenever
<br>
its adherents acquire power, or seize it, and put their beliefs into
<br>
practice, by oppressing the 'parasitical middleman', poverty invariably
<br>
follows.  The theory fell on a particularly rich soil because American
<br>
farmers in general, and Southerners in particular, already had a
<br>
paranoid suspicion of the 'money power' dating from colonial times.&quot;
<br>
<p>Other books I've been reading, such as DeSoto &quot;The Mystery of
<br>
Capital&quot;, Mancur Olsen's &quot;Power and Prosperity&quot;, and Easterly's
<br>
&quot;The Elusive Quest for Growth&quot;, all priase the very sophisticated,
<br>
intricate, and indirect kinds of markets, and blame a lot of
<br>
third world poverty on their absence there.
<br>
<p>So I did a Google search on &quot;physical fallacy&quot;, and came across
<br>
Peter Jaworsky's blog:
<br>
<p>12.10.02
<br>
A NOTE ON PROCESS part 2
<br>
&quot;the physical fallacy&quot;
<br>
<p>According to Sowell, &quot;in medieval times, the physical fallacy led to the doctrine that an object had a &quot;just price&quot; based upon
<br>
objective costs incurred by the producer and not upon the subjective valuation of the consumer.&quot; (Sowell, p. 67)
<br>
<p>The 'physical fallacy' is, roughly, the idea that only those who deal with things 'physically' or tangibly with their tactile senses
<br>
'actually' do something with whatever it is they're handling. It is an emphasis on less abstract activities--the placing of
<br>
ingredients into a pot, rather than the recipe itself. It emphasizes the role of physical composition, over abstract invention. The
<br>
physical fallacy is the idea, at core, that only those who deal physically with physical things are 'actually' doing anything.
<br>
<p>Take interest and the role of banks and lending institutions. For a lot of people, they do 'nothing' and, thereby, are making money
<br>
on our backs. The function of interest, the making of additional capital out of a set amount of capital (or money on money), is seen
<br>
as dishonest or, worse, downright immoral (not that dishonesty is moral...)
<br>
<p>Lending money, however, is a valuable function necessitated by a number of considerations. Not the least of which is the fact that
<br>
some of us 'know' what to do with a certain sum of money right now. Others amongst us sort of want money, but how much we want it is
<br>
dependant upon how much we are willing to give up in the future. That is, after all, the trade-off that we make--more money now, for
<br>
less money later (assuming borrowing, not earnings. What you earn today is typically less than what you will earn tomorrow).
<br>
<p>The function the lender serves is to bid up the price of current dollars (measured in future payments) until it more closely
<br>
approximates the value of that money amongst a various sum of individuals. The interest rate will change as people either want more
<br>
money now, or more of it later. Lenders are people willing to give up immediate satisfaction, for a greater satisfaction later on.
<br>
It is what we do when we invest either in financial things (stocks, bonds, whatever) or in personal capital (an education, piano
<br>
mastery and so on).  We give up immediate pleasure for a greater gain in the future.
<br>
<p>So too with the lenders.  No pleasure now, more pleasure later.
<br>
<p>We seem to hate the lenders, however, in accord with the physical fallacy. They do nothing, really, except change the time structure
<br>
of money. They allow others to bring capital to bear in the present, and await their enrichment later. Intertemporal employment, if
<br>
you will.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, the process is necessary and valuable. It allows those who value current money more than others to get at that
<br>
money--a valuable service.  Those who value present money a little less can make exchanges. In this way, we approximate actual
<br>
time-preferences of various actors on the market, and manage to satisfy more values, wants, needs and desires.
