<em>&gt; Here's the problem.  If we're not  committed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishing democracy in Iraq, we may be content to install 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or allow to come to power) a &quot;friendly dictator&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mez,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Personally I don't see how you avoid that.  I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know of a single democracy in that part of the world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excepting possibly Turkey.  As you are from Eygpt perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you know of one -- I don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Not only that but when I talk to my Moslem friends in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my neighborhood they don't seem to have a big demand for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy.  So tell me how we do this?
</em><br>
<p>Ron, I think we've hit an impasse here.  You seem to believe that
<br>
muslims just aren't cut out for democracy.  I disagree.
<br>
<p>Democracy has worked in Turkey.  It's slowly taking hold in Indonesia.
<br>
It works in Lebanon (and worked better before Israel invaded).  It
<br>
worked in Pakistan until the present dictator overthrew it.
<br>
Democratic reforms were starting to take hold in Iran until Bush
<br>
strengthened the hardliners with the &quot;axis of evil&quot; speech.  Qatar and
<br>
the United Arab Emirates are both taking steps towards democracy.  
<br>
<p>People in the middle east want a say in how they're ruled.  People in
<br>
the middle east want the wealth and opportunity that come in
<br>
capitalist democracy.  I say this based on the hundreds of people I
<br>
know and have talked to at length in the middle east.
<br>
<p>In any case, we seem to have both made up our minds on this issue, so
<br>
maybe we can move on to something else.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
mez
