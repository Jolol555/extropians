<em>&gt; &gt; Why is the current narrative of the U.S. media in Bush's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; back pocket, if policies are forged that affects everyone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (U.S. citizen's and others) lives? Who is paying for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; narrative?
</em><br>
<p>Of course it's not, and that this is quite a distortion.
<br>
One sees on American TV a variety of viewpoints.  Until
<br>
recently, it is true, one could only find liberally-biased
<br>
shows, but the Fox TV News channel offers (a sole, I believe)
<br>
alternative.
<br>
<p>On radio, the situation is almost entirely reversed.  More
<br>
stations carry conservative or right-wing shows, although
<br>
the conservative's monopoly of the radio waves is not nearly
<br>
so complete as the left domination of TV.  I find that radio
<br>
may at this point in history cater more to conservatism
<br>
because this is their moment, so to speak.  The long, rational,
<br>
coherent sentences of people articulating a comprehensive
<br>
point of view find their outlet in radio;  TV is the medium
<br>
of images and emotion, and one-liners.
<br>
<p>Sixty years ago it was the reverse.  Socialism was unopposed
<br>
intellectually, and radio talk-shows extolling socialism and
<br>
articulating the shortcomings of capitalism would have played
<br>
very well.
<br>
<p>Ron says,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        It has been shown that the vast majority of the main stream media 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voted for Gore and Clinton before him.  It has also been shown that time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after time when folks have the opportunity to chose between a conservative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a liberal talk show host they will go for the conservative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Given that the majority (estimated as slightly over 90%) of the main 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stream media voted for Bush's opponent it is hard to see how the media is in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush's back pocket.
</em><br>
<p>But what is the *reason* for the leftist control of traditional
<br>
media?
<br>
<p>It has nothing to do with anyone paying for a certain narrative,
<br>
as Amara suggests.
<br>
<p>I think instead that it is two-fold.  First, journalists are often
<br>
people idealists who became journalists in the first place because
<br>
they wanted to change the world.  Their idealism prompted them to
<br>
adopt collectivism for the sake of the world.  Persons more
<br>
narrowly focused on their own self-interest or on the interests
<br>
of people closer to them tend more towards economic exchanges
<br>
with others, and so have a tendency to form the entrepreneurial
<br>
classes.
<br>
<p>But a second powerful affliction is at work.  And that, simply put,
<br>
is the decline of a notion of objectivity in academia.  Were you
<br>
to bring up to Peter Arnett, Dan Rather, Walter Cronkite, Larry
<br>
King, Roger Mudd, Tom Brokaw, Katie Couric, or Peter Jennings their
<br>
bias and lack of objectivity, they'd simply reply that objectivity
<br>
is an illusion.  They'd point out that fashionable intellectuals
<br>
have dismissed objectivity from consideration long ago.
<br>
<p>My demand that a responsible and professional journalist deliver
<br>
the news in a manner that makes it nearly impossible to divine
<br>
his or her political leanings would evoke much mirth.
<br>
<p>&quot;Not only is what you are asking impossible,&quot; they'd reply, &quot;but
<br>
(just between you and me) I have a moral duty to try to fight
<br>
the good fight against poverty and injustice.&quot;
<br>
<p>But the key to getting their behavior to change---or since that's
<br>
going to be impossible, to affect the next generation of reporters
<br>
---is to emphasize that objectivity is *not* impossible.
<br>
<p>I am reading a terrific book called &quot;The Five Points&quot; which
<br>
describes the great slum of New York in the 19th century, on
<br>
which the movie &quot;The Gangs of New York&quot; is based.  The author
<br>
has had innumerable opportunities to betray his political
<br>
ideologies, but has stoutly avoided doing so.  He has striven
<br>
for utter objectivity and even handedness.  Even about the
<br>
terrible Irish famine, he explores what was going on at the
<br>
lowest levels, debunks common falsehoods, and shows that in
<br>
general there were few saints or sinners.
<br>
<p>So maybe he must be a conservative after all?  I mean, so
<br>
many liberals such as the above seem to consider it their
<br>
duty to be biased.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  For further reading on this subject, for those open-minded
<br>
enough to try, I suggest &quot;Coloring the News&quot;, by William McGowan
<br>
or &quot;Bias&quot; by Bernard Goldberg.
