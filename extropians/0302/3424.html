<p><em>&gt;That's a scientific fact. But you don't think you'll ever be in danger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from iraqi chemical weapons, do you?
</em><br>
<p><p>Huh? That's a scientific fact you say? But wait, it's not even remotely
<br>
related to salient point John Clark was making is it? No, you snipped that
<br>
part right outta there didn't you - the part about Iraq being CAUGHT RED
<br>
HANDED lying on multiple occasions and in direct violation of the original
<br>
GW1 CONDITIONS OF CEASE-FIRE.
<br>
<p>There's an old saying that goes something like:
<br>
<p>&quot;Cheat me once, shame on you. Cheat me twice shame on me.&quot;
<br>
<p>To that I would add - Cheat me three times, and perhaps I don't really
<br>
deserve the title of SUPERPOWER.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There are so many unanswered questions: Is there really VX (or other B/C
</em><br>
weapons)? Where? How much?
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>Really Kai, there are not. Your moronic questions bring to mind a
<br>
hypothetical scenario in which the tactical SWAT teams are swooping in on
<br>
the home of a serial killer - Jeffrey Dahmer say, and some fuckwad is
<br>
marching up and down the sidewalk yelling WAIT!! BUT BUT, THERE ARE SO MANY
<br>
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS HERE:
<br>
<p>Like what did the murdered victims actually TASTE like?
<br>
And how do we know poor Jeff is going to do it again? - maybe he's all full
<br>
now.
<br>
What's the real reason he felt a need to do this?
<br>
And you SWAT guys surely don't think you're personally at risk of getting
<br>
eaten up by Jeffery do you?
<br>
And can't we just set up a perimeter around his yard so he can't sneak out
<br>
and do it again?
<br>
And let's just think about this for awhile, what's a few more months anyhow?
<br>
And, in other words: Do you have any proof for your claims?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The CIA is neither convinced that Saddam _has_ significant amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weapons &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Even if that were true, and it obviously isn't, what's all this &quot;significant
<br>
amounts&quot; nonsense? What part of NONE do you not understand. IRAQ has legally
<br>
revoked its pre-GW1 right, by signing the cease fire to possess or conceal
<br>
ANY restricted weapons whatsoever. That means NONE, NADA, ZIPPO, ZILCH, NOT
<br>
ONE DROP, NOT AT ALL, IN NO WAY - PERIOD. Allied and Iraqi military leaders
<br>
meet on the battlefield to discuss terms for a formal cease-fire to end the
<br>
Gulf War. Iraq agreed to abide by all of the UN resolutions (Mar. 3, 1991).
<br>
The first Allied prisoners of war are released (Mar. 4). Official cease-fire
<br>
accepted and signed (April 6).
