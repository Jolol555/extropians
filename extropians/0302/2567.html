</em><br>
<p>I find it interesting that probabilities must work differently for these
<br>
two types of people. Consider a thought experiment where you're shown a
<br>
computer printout which is supposed to be the millionth bit in the binary
<br>
expansion of pi. However the computer is somewhat faulty and in 1% of the
<br>
branches of the multiverse it gives an incorrect answer. Now you're asked
<br>
to guess the true value of the millionth bit of pi (let's call this X). If
<br>
you guess correctly you'll be rewarded, otherwise punished, with about
<br>
equal severity. Suppose you see the number 0 on your printout, and that
<br>
you don't have any other information about what X is, and you can't
<br>
compute it in your head. Obviously both the egoist-temporalist and the
<br>
altruist-Platonist would choose to guess 0, but their reasoning process
<br>
would be different.
<br>
<p>Before seeing the printout, both types believe that the probability of X
<br>
being 0 is .5. After seeing the printout, the egoist-temporalist would
<br>
apply Bayes's rule and think that the probability of X being 0 is .99.  
<br>
He reasons that guessing 0 lead to a .99 probability of reward and .01
<br>
probability of punishment. His expected utility of choosing 0 is 
<br>
.99*U(reward) + .01*U(punishment).
<br>
<p>An altruist-Platonist would instead continue to believe that the
<br>
probability of X being 0 is .5. He reasons that if X is 0, then his
<br>
current measure is .99m (where m is the measure of himself before seeing
<br>
the printout), and if X is 1, then his current measure is .01m. So
<br>
guessing 0 would lead to a .5 probability of .99m people being rewarded
<br>
and .5 probability of .01m people being punished. His expected utility of
<br>
choosing 0 is .5*U(.99m people rewarded) + .5*U(.01m people punished).
<br>
Note that if he did apply Bayes's rule, then his expected utility would
<br>
instead become .99*U(.99m people rewarded) + .01*U(.01m people punished)
<br>
which would weight the reward too heavily. It doesn't matter in this case
<br>
but would matter in other situations.
<br>
<p>What's weird and interesting is that for the altruist-Platonist, emperical
<br>
data don't change his subjective probabilities of mathematical statements.
<br>
They only tell him what his current measure is and what the measures of
<br>
people can can affect are, under various mathematical assumptions whose
<br>
probabilities are determined only be internal calculations. This seems to
<br>
be a very alien way of reasoning, which I'm not sure any humans can
<br>
practice in daily life. But which type would the Friendly AI be, I wonder?
