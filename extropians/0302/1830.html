<p><p>Some things have been modernized, mainly the electronics.  The shuttles
<br>
are still, fundamentally, aging machines that are ever more expensive to
<br>
maintain and operate.  They needed to have been replaced a long time
<br>
ago.  Stuff like this will happen again if NASA maintains its present
<br>
course, instead of actually funding replacements* for the space shuttle
<br>
- and cutting off contractors that have failed in that project before
<br>
and have every financial reason to fail again if it'll sop up all of
<br>
NASA's resources on that project.
<br>
<p>* Replacements cheap enough to operate that they can be tested to the
<br>
point of failure so the rest of the fleet can, financially, be retired
<br>
(and replaced) before it gets there.  (Doesn't matter if it's
<br>
physically/technologically possible; it simply won't happen if it costs
<br>
way too much.)
<br>
<p>BTW, don't accuse me of being insensitive here.  One of the mission
<br>
specialists was a personal friend of my dad, and I had to comfort him.
<br>
Angry that NASA's mismanagement of replacement programs has allowed this
<br>
malfunction to happen, perhaps, but not insensitive.
