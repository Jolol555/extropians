Avatar's post on the Melbourne anti-war demonstration and Hubert's comments
<br>
force me to raise a sticky question.
<br>
<p>&quot;When do we act?&quot;
<br>
<p>Everyone is careful to say that they do not support Saddam Hussein but
<br>
nobody seems to have a concrete plan for getting rid of him.  And they
<br>
fail to mention the *real* loss of human life of allowing him to remain
<br>
in power (due to the sanctions against Iraq) and the potential for future
<br>
losses of human life should he remain in power (odds seem against Saddam
<br>
undergoing a miraculous transformation into a peacenik from his current
<br>
orientation of restoring the Arab/Islamic world to power with him as
<br>
its leader).
<br>
<p>Mind you, I am not in favor of a war if containment can work.  *BUT*
<br>
I've seen no reasonable discussion on whether the possible number of
<br>
lives saved by going to war and eliminating Saddam will exceed the
<br>
number of lives that might be lost in such a war.
<br>
<p>The entire &quot;peace&quot; movement I see here in Seattle (and perhaps
<br>
in Melbourne or Germany) seems to be based on the concept of
<br>
&quot;no war ever&quot;.
<br>
<p>The most recent episode of &quot;West Wing&quot; that I've seen here in the
<br>
U.S. was quite interesting.  [&quot;West Wing&quot; for those of you outside
<br>
of the U.S. is a prime time TV show about the intense environment
<br>
at the top levels of the executive branch within the &quot;White House&quot;.]
<br>
The President, at his second inauguration chose to adopt a policy
<br>
that the U.S. would intervene in international confrontations using
<br>
only the basis of &quot;moral correctness&quot;.
<br>
<p>The basis for this position is a fictitious confrontation in Africa
<br>
presumably derived from the events of the Rwanda slaughter which
<br>
the U.S., Europe, Australia, and the U.N. were content to ignore.
<br>
<p>Given the actions Saddam has taken against both foreign armies
<br>
(e.g. Iranian soldiers) as well as his own citizens, is this
<br>
man not a war criminal and guilty of crimes against humanity?
<br>
And if so -- *what* should the world be doing about bringing
<br>
him to justice?
<br>
<p>IMO, sticking ones head in the sand and hoping the problem will
<br>
simply &quot;go away&quot; isn't an extropic approach.  Go read the history
<br>
books on WWII to see how far that approach will get you.
<br>
