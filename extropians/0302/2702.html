</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Assuming that I understand what you are suggesting (Gee, that's
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I have always read that we got into this mess where we need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws to stop polluters because back in the 19th Century we made a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious decision to protect manufacturing, mining, etc., by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; removing the power to sue from individual citizens.  Yep, we said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those sectors of our economy were so important and needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encouragement to grow so bad that we wouldn't allow individuals to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sue them for damages caused by pollution and who knows what else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        If we want to stop pollution and other such offenses dead in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its tracks why don't we restore the right of individuals to sue?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without even getting heavy in our treatment can you imagine the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; him into small claims court for damage to their paint jobs either on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        their car or their house or maybe both? You know long before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OSHA, manufacturers lived in fear of their annual inspection by their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insurance company -- those guys could cancel your insurance or worse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet raise the premiums.  Many times the insurance guy's report took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the form, &quot;you are doing X.  Correct that situation by doing Y and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't raise your insurance premium by some astronomical amount Z.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Things tended to get fixed. Ron H.
</em><br>
<p>### Yes, this is what I mean. The ability to sue of course must be balanced
<br>
by appropriate safeguards, such as routine assessment of court costs to the
<br>
losing party, caps on punitive damages, appropriate standards for the use of
<br>
scientific evidence, drastic reduction in the number of statutes, and
<br>
perhaps other measures, but yes, I do think that this is a much better,
<br>
fine-grained instrument than OSHA's hammer.
