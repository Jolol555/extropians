<em>&gt;&gt; BTW, nuclear fission did not require significant tax money outside of
</em><br>
basic R&amp;D during the war (except perhaps in Europe, where everything
<br>
seems to be supported by taxes), and  if you take away the massive costs
<br>
imposed by regulation, political interference in waste disposal, and
<br>
legal attacks by greens, is still cheaper than wind power.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What would be the cost without regulation!  First Energy here in the
<br>
Ohio area had the cap from their reactor half eaten through before it
<br>
was caught even with the rigorous inspection process!
<br>
<p>They have been shut down for some time now just trying to decide if it's
<br>
worth replacing the multi-million dollar cap!
<br>
<p>Now that the problem was caught at First Energy I now understand that
<br>
the same problem's being found at other sites around the country.  
<br>
<p>At what about after they shut these plant down?  The cost extends how
<br>
many years past when they are done producing energy?   The cost to
<br>
protect and cleanup these shut down facilities will go on forever. 
<br>
<p>On another note:  Does anyone know what exists under the ground where a
<br>
nuclear bomb test has occurred?
<br>
<p>Is it a hermetically sealed glass container created by the blast itself
<br>
that is essentially hollow?
<br>
<p>How long does the ultra-high heat created in the rock take to cool.
<br>
<p>Could these pockets be used to create a closed system of geothermal
<br>
energy?  Pump water down one hole, use the steam coming up the other
<br>
hole to turn generator resend the cooled radioactive water back down the
<br>
first hole?
<br>
<p>If this was done in the desert with no water table to speak of, or at
<br>
one of the nuclear test sites that already exist, I would see minimal
<br>
risk of outside contamination if the proper safeguards were built in.
<br>
<p>I am aware that this is probably pie in the sky for some reason or
<br>
other, but I haven't found any research showing why this wouldn't work!
