Lee I believe I understand the point you hace presented. Now I will ask 
<br>
again, just to highlight this situation as reality.
<br>
<p>Question: If America wars against Iraq, what will those individuals and 
<br>
governments do to retaliate against the United States? Will this retaliation 
<br>
be effective?
<br>
<p>Lee noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;But my *attitude* towards, say, France or Germany invading
<br>
Bosnia would have been &quot;What affair is it of my country?
<br>
That's in Europe.&quot;  To be honest, I felt the same way about
<br>
Russia and Chechnya.  So one other item to put on the table
<br>
is, &quot;Perhaps other nations should mind their own business.
<br>
What happens in Iraq doesn't *directly* concern them.*
<br>
<p>Now I must quickly say that of course, talk is cheap and
<br>
everyone (including other countries, of course) is quite
<br>
entitled to their opinion.  But from the way some sound,
<br>
it's as if they regard the upcoming invasion as taking
<br>
place on their own soil!
<br>
<p>As for &quot;today, yes, it's Iraq, but tomorrow it may be Iceland&quot;,
<br>
that is so silly it hardly deserves comment.  I can just see
<br>
ten years of pressure from dozens and dozens of countries,
<br>
innumerable U.N. resolutions, thousands of flights over
<br>
Iceland to figure out just what those scoundrels are up to,
<br>
etc., etc.  ;-)
<br>
<p>Lee&gt;&gt;
