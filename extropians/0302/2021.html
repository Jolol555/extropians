Amara and all,
<br>
<p>This was one of my favorite sources as well.  I was glad to see it came
<br>
back.  
<br>
<p>The Rational Review has a similar daily news email which I tend to find as
<br>
valuable as the FMNews.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.rationalreview.com/news/">http://www.rationalreview.com/news/</a>
<br>
<p>That is, if you Liked FMNews, youll probably like RR news digest.

<p><p>Since late last December, Free-market.net has been homeless.
<br>
It looks like it found a new home.

<p>=========================================================================
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.free-market.net/">http://www.free-market.net/</a>
<br>
<p><p><p>Dear Free-Marketeers,
<br>
<p><p>We have great news for you! The International Society for Individual
<br>
Liberty has purchased Free-Market.Net. We have long admired ISIL
<br>
as an effective, principled libertarian organization that has built a
<br>
network of activists in nearly 90 countries. FMN now has a new lease
<br>
on life with the backing of a solid libertarian group that has been
<br>
active for 30 years.
<br>
<p>We believe this change of ownership will actually prove a boost to
<br>
both ISIL and FMN, a synergy that will empower both to promote
<br>
more freedom throughout the world than ever before. Did you know
<br>
that ISIL helped counsel the libertarians in Costa Rica who've made
<br>
such dramatic progress in that country? That kind of impact,
<br>
combined with the super-cost-effectiveness of FMN's internet
<br>
operations, will lead to many good things for people who care about
<br>
freedom.
<br>
<p>And that's important, because freedom seems to be in greater
<br>
danger than it has been for many years. Fortunately, in the midst of
<br>
crisis, there are also great opportunities emerging to advance liberty
<br>
in America and around the world.
<br>
<p>So please forgive our dust while we rebuild here at Free-Market.Net,
<br>
and get things back on track with the new FMN/ISIL team. The result
<br>
will be a leaner, more effective freedom network, which we hope you
<br>
will use, enjoy and support.
<br>
<p>If you would like to help jump-start FMN's rebirth -- and help ensure
<br>
the continuation of the best possible services and resources for
<br>
libertarians -- please consider making a contribution to ISIL today.
<br>
There's no such thing as a free lunch!
<br>
<p>They'll put it to work immediately in keeping FMN online and putting it
<br>
back in motion. You can make a tax-deductible contribution to ISIL
<br>
easily, online.
<br>
<p>Thank you for your support -- we look forward to the greatest
<br>
progress yet in realizing our mutually cherished dream of Freedom In
<br>
Our Time.
<br>
<p>In Liberty,
<br>
<p>Louis James
<br>
CEO, Free-Market.Net
<br>
<p>Vince Miller
<br>
President, ISIL
