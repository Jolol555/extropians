### Ah, Kai, you know I am a right-thinking guy, how *can* you suspect me of
<br>
supporting the jackbooted thugs?  :-)
<br>
<p>Actually, while using the direct regulatory powers of the government is one
<br>
of the ways of diminishing the harm to third parties (as in people getting
<br>
poisoned by exhaust), there are IMO better options, such as a well-regulated
<br>
liability insurance market. Imagine that all participants in the economy
<br>
would be required to obtain a general liability insurance of certain
<br>
quality, in a market with many independent providers, and with a free-market
<br>
court system.
<br>
<p>The upshot would be a very flexible system where harming somebody with your
<br>
exhaust would entail an increase in your insurance premium. You would be
<br>
still free to burn and pollute as you want to, except when you actually harm
<br>
another person. This would be different from the current system, where you
<br>
are forced to obey laws with only a very tenuous link the welfare of others,
<br>
laws which in the case of federal fuel efficiency standards were enacted for
<br>
pure political calculation, as a knee-jerk response to the 1970's oil
<br>
crisis.
<br>
<p>The Big Bad Government is frequently the first solution that comes to mind,
<br>
but the last solution that should be used.
