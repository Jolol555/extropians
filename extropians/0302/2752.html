### I do not quite understand your above paragraph. Specifically, I do not know what is &quot;voluntary cognitive part of conscious experience&quot;.
<br>
<p>In any case, my comment you quoted refers to the progressive increase in the percentage of neurons whose activity correlates with conscious experience as one goes from V1 to the parietal to frontal cortices. Please see the abstracts below.

<p>View from the top: hierarchies and reverse hierarchies in the visual system.

<p>We propose that explicit vision advances in reverse hierarchical direction, as shown for perceptual learning. Processing along the feedforward hierarchy of areas, leading to increasingly complex representations, is automatic and implicit, while conscious perception begins at the hierarchy's top, gradually returning downward as needed. Thus, our initial conscious percept--vision at a glance--matches a high-level, generalized, categorical scene interpretation, identifying &quot;forest before trees.&quot; For later vision with scrutiny, reverse hierarchy routines focus attention to specific, active, low-level units, incorporating into conscious perception detailed information available there. Reverse Hierarchy Theory dissociates between early explicit perception and implicit low-level vision, explaining a variety of phenomena. Feature search &quot;pop-out&quot; is attributed to high areas, where large receptive fields underlie spread attention detecting categorical differences. Search for conjunctions or fine discriminations depends on reentry to low-level specific receptive fields using serial focused attention, consistent with recently reported primary visual cortex effects.

<p>The role of primary visual cortex (V1) in visual awareness.

<p>In the search for the neural correlate of visual awareness, much controversy exists about the role of primary visual cortex. Here, the neurophysiological data from V1 recordings in awake monkeys are examined in light of two general classes of models of visual awareness. In the first model type, visual awareness is seen as being mediated either by a particular set of areas or pathways, or alternatively by a specific set of neurons. In these models, the role of V1 seems rather limited, as the mere activity of V1 cells seems insufficient to mediate awareness. In the second model type, awareness is hypothesized to be mediated by a global mechanism, i.e. a specific kind of activity not linked to a particular area or cell type. Two separate versions of global models are discussed, synchronous oscillations and spike rate modulations. It is shown that V1 synchrony does not reflect perception but rather the horizontal connections between neurons, indicating that V1 synchrony cannot be a direct neural correlate of conscious percepts. However, the rate of spike discharges of V1 neurons is strongly modulated by perceptual context, and these modulations correlate very well with aspects of perceptual organization, visual awareness, and attention. If these modulations serve as a neural correlate of visual awareness, then V1 contributes to that neural correlate. Whether V1 plays a role in the neural correlate of visual awareness thus strongly depends on the way visual awareness is hypothesized to be implemented in the brain.

<p>Visual field defects result from postgeniculate lesions. It is generally assumed that absolute defects are caused by total destruction or denervation of primary visual cortex (V1) and that the degraded but conscious vision that remains or returns in relative or partial defects is mediated by compromised V1 cortex that retains a sufficiently large population of functional neurons. We here report the results of three patients with long-standing postgeniculate lesions who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while their partial defect was stimulated with high-contrast reversing checkerboard stimuli. Although the stimulation evoked conscious visual impressions in all three, in only one patient did it activate perilesional V1. In the other two we found no evidence for perilesional activation, indicating that some conscious vision may return in the absence of functional ipsilesional V1. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.
