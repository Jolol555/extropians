[Damien]
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But wait! Here's this great swathe of possible paths, all of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taken, each of them the trajectory native to its own idiosyncratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world--but what *we* *here* experience is (almost) always that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; goddam minimal action path. This looks wildly inconsistent with MW to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me. (Of course it might be that in the MW manifold there is an a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; priori high p value for the least action path, so any observer is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; almost always in such a world--but that just establishes by fiat what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is meant to be explained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Any takers?
</em><br>
<p>[Rafal] 
<br>
<em>&gt; Let me guess: the measure of universes close to the minimal action path
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is much greater than the measure of universes diverging from it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a Damien who always wins the lottery :-)
</em><br>
<p><p>Griffiths and, later, Gell-Mann &amp; Hartle realized that it was possible 
<br>
to build an ontology, well maybe a ... cosmology on Feynman's 
<br>
representation. And they called it *consistent histories*. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The main principle of Griffiths' theory is this. If a quantum system 
<br>
has a certain value after a measurement, it had it shortly before the 
<br>
measurement,and it will keep it shortly after the measurement. The 
<br>
theory supposes established the initial and the final events, 
<br>
independently from whatever happened and from whatever will happen. 
<br>
<p>Shortly the *consistent* condition means that the effects of 
<br>
interference are negligible. And this means that there is no 
<br>
interference in quantum amplitudes propagating from an event to 
<br>
another event (in the Hilbert space) along *separate* paths.
<br>
If (and only if) the particular history is consistent it is 
<br>
also possible to attach a weight, or, let us say, to calculate 
<br>
a probability for that individual history. 
<br>
<p>Gell-Mann &amp; Hartle were the first top physicists who realized that 
<br>
decoherence was the missing point in Griffiths'consistent histories. 
<br>
A history (which here may be fine-grained or coarse-grained) is a 
<br>
particular sequence of alternatives. It is possible to have histories 
<br>
within histories, depending on the fine- or coarse- graining. 
<br>
Feynman liked so much this approach, also because its formalism 
<br>
is based on an application of Feynman's path integral representation.
<br>
<p>So, yes, Damien wins often the lottery if he focused and .. lucky.
