<br>
<p>If this were true then coroners could perform the same procedure on
<br>
murder victims and get an
<br>
Image of the murderer.
<br>
<p>I've seen this plots similar to this in B SciFi movies, but never
<br>
considered that this would actually be possible.

### This was a classical experiment with radioactively labeled
<br>
deoxyglucose (if I remember correctly) being taken up while the monkey
<br>
looked at a spiderweb grid (actually a target used in ophthalmology to
<br>
analyze visual fields). The nerve cells activated by the target burned
<br>
more energy, and took up the label more than inactive cells. Indeed you
<br>
could see a somewhat distorted but easily identifiable grid in their
<br>
primary visual cortex.
<br>
<p>However, we have to remember that only a very small number of neurons,
<br>
if any, in the primary visual cortex, is correlated with conscious
<br>
experience.
