<em>&gt; &quot;So you believe that &quot;our unrivaled power to crush our foes&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what will draw the Middle East into freedom and democracy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really? Isn't it more likely to increasingly lead to the US and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all it stands for being hated as the worst sort of tyranny? Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we reduced to &quot;we will crush you if you resist&quot;?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amazing. What brought Germany to freedom and democracy? What kept South
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Korea from falling into a Communist sponsored nightmare in 1950? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kept all of Europe from falling under the boot heel of Nazism?
</em><br>
<p>To which Kai responded to me:
<br>
<p>&quot;(1) To compare the Middle-East of today with Europe of the 30s/40s or 
<br>
Asia of the 50s/60s is not very sensible. The political structures and 
<br>
history, the different interests, the influence of religion, ethnical 
<br>
groups, the oil business, etc. are very different.&quot;
<br>
<p>And they were similar in Korea circa 1950 and Nazi Germany? It is only not 
<br>
sensible to those who do not acknowledge that force is sometimes required to 
<br>
maintain and defend one's ideals and freedoms. Our past successes are not 
<br>
meant to justify this action, they are merely to illustrate that we have had 
<br>
to use force in the past, and those actions proved successful and ultimately 
<br>
positive.  Additionally, one cannot compare the actions of the United States 
<br>
to those of the expansionist ones of the Nazis and Soviets as some have done. 
<br>
Our domestic record is not the same, nor is our international one. 
<br>
<p>(2) Even successful actions in the past can not flatly justify current 
<br>
actions; neither morally, nor technically. Every action stands for its 
<br>
own. To put it simple: Doing something good and sensible in the past 
<br>
doesn't excuse doing something wrong and stupid now :-)
<br>
<p>Nor at any point on this forum did I ever say it did. I have only pointed out 
<br>
that too many people have used examples of past entanglements to justify our 
<br>
not getting involved in this one, when they don't even have full command of 
<br>
the facts of those prior situations. I am simply seeking more justification 
<br>
for this action being inappropriate than &quot;we allied ourselves with Saddam in 
<br>
the past.&quot; So what? We allied ourselves with Stalin during World War II. Or 
<br>
&quot;Many people will die needlessly.&quot; Where is the factual basis for this? This 
<br>
is coming from the same people who said Afghanistan would turn into a blood 
<br>
bath for the US military. &quot;It will make the terrorists hate us more.&quot; Where 
<br>
are all the major attacks following our removal of the Taliban? 
<br>
<p>&quot;(3) The question, if a) a war, b) now will really solve more problems 
<br>
then messing things up, is still unanswered. As far as I've understood 
<br>
the Middle-East experts I've heard, they predict a rather uncontrollable 
<br>
outburst of violence in the whole region, as well as a much higher risk 
<br>
of terrorist actions. Or to refer to the historical events you mentioned; 
<br>
this war could turn into a second vietnam.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is precisely what I'm talking about. Explain to me how this would turn 
<br>
into &quot;a second Vietnam.&quot; What two major superpowers will be aiding Iraq 
<br>
during this war with weapons, supplies, and logistical aid? And, given that 
<br>
one of the worst holocausts in the 20th Century occurred in Indochina 
<br>
following the United States withdrawal, you only provide more proof with that 
<br>
sort of statement that is in everyone's best interests (save mustachioed 
<br>
totalitarians) for us to become involved.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
<br>
<p><p>&quot;At every turn, we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with 
<br>
America and little that is right.&quot;
