</em><br>
<p>Point granted, you obviously may know more about this since I've only
<br>
lived in Washington since ~'83.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Breeder reactors can either produce OR eliminate nuclear material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on how you tune them.
</em><br>
<p>Point also granted.  But they are *very* blunt tools for this job
<br>
(if they weren't it seems likely we wouldn't have all those storage
<br>
tanks out at Hanford...).
<br>
<p>I believe that the problem may relate to the fact that one has
<br>
to provide protons/neutrons at specific energies to optimally
<br>
transmute radioactive isotopes (this is related to their neutron
<br>
stopping/absorption effeciencies I think).
<br>
<p>So there are two problems with nuclear waste:
<br>
(a) separation -- ideally you want to *only* be dealing with the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radioactive isotopes.  I don't see this being solved until we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have real nanotech and molecular sorting (Nanosystems 13.2.2,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanomedicine VI Section 3.4.2) or molecular weighing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Nanomedicine 4.4.3 [single proton Massometers].
<br>
and
<br>
(b) transmutation -- which optimally involves tuning the energy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the transmuting (neutrons/protons) to match the absorption
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the isotope being transmuted.
<br>
<p>I think (b) is why the Los Alamos people have been leaning in the
<br>
direction of accelerators rather than breeder reactors.  (Control of the
<br>
energy levels (e.g. energy/neutron) in accelerators I believe can be
<br>
much more finely tuned.)
<br>
<p>It still however doesn't solve the separation problem which
<br>
is (I believe) why we still have places like Hanford.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You had one there for a while... I can show you pictures of the core
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being assembled if you like, complete with pictures of my dad looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Homer Simpson with sideburns, a lab coat, and clipboard looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on.... ;)
</em><br>
<p>Bring them to a future Extro Conf.  I would certainly enjoy looking
<br>
at them.  And I'm sure many others would be interested in seeing
<br>
a &quot;real&quot; breeder reactor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet where are the French storing their waste? Certainly not the way we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are right now.
</em><br>
<p>Let us be specific so we don't do hand waving.  There are two types of
<br>
&quot;waste&quot;.  Spent fuel rods and radioactive materials from decommissioning
<br>
plants.
<br>
<p>I suspect the French may be reprocessing the fuel rods [though I am not
<br>
sure -- this requires an expert opinion of someone really familiar with
<br>
the French situation.]  It seems unlikely that they are storing them
<br>
the way the utilities in the U.S. are -- something that creates a
<br>
significant terrorist hazard.
<br>
<p>The &quot;decommissioning&quot; problem is one that I suspect they haven't
<br>
had to deal with (significantly) yet because (most?) of the plants
<br>
haven't reached the end of their useful lives.  But it does really
<br>
press on (a/b) above.
