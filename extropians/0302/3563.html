<p>I do not believe that &quot;legal&quot; is the proper word.  The members of the
<br>
U.N. all have independent &quot;legal&quot; systems (which clearly do not agree
<br>
with one another).  I think the correct terms might be either &quot;approved&quot;
<br>
or &quot;sanctioned&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do you think the consequences will be if the U.S. does decide to
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Does the U.N. charter prohibit countries from acting in their national
<br>
interests?  [I don't think it does.]  If indeed it does -- then we have
<br>
probably had dozens of countries in &quot;breach&quot; over the last 50 years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I haven't been able to find any amendments to the U.N. charter. Do
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Very interesting point.  If it hasn't been amended, then one has to
<br>
presume that any votes (vetos, etc.) by Russia are null and void.
<br>
I believe that there was a lot of legislation within Russia in the
<br>
early '90s to &quot;assume&quot; all obligations (rights?) that were held
<br>
by the S.U.  Now whether such legislation is recognized by
<br>
everyone else is an interesting question indeed.
