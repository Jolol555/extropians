<p>Maybe I didn't get the clue, but as I understand it, a dangerous / 
<br>
polluting industry would still not be stopped by public will, as long as 
<br>
it delivers enough profit to pay the insurance. The problem of pollution 
<br>
would become only an economical equation: How much profit can we draw 
<br>
out of a business, before we have to pay for the consequences, 
<br>
regardless of the damages produces in between. What about global 
<br>
consequences? We still don't know how much we are responsible for the 
<br>
damage to the ozone layer, the global warming, and we still don't know 
<br>
for sure, what the consequences will be. But in the meanwhile, the 
<br>
companies responsible go bancrupt, the persons who were in charge retire 
<br>
or die, and maybe we all are responsible to a certain degree. How could 
<br>
any court ever decide such a case and how much money is a premature 
<br>
death by lung cancer worth?
