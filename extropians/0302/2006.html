</em><br>
<p>The problem seems to be that it gets fashionable in the US and Europe
<br>
to transform democratic structures into bureaucratic and eventually
<br>
totalitarian structures. Maybe it doesn't make that much sense any more
<br>
to oppose each single law and instead try to remind the law making
<br>
bodies that they must take the respective constitution more serious
<br>
than the lobbyists. This seems most urgent in the US which is already
<br>
sliding down a slippery road to totalitarism.
<br>
<p>Personally, I find the current copyright craze even more scary. And
<br>
when I read how eagerly McCarthy's heirs (Homeland foobar) grab power
<br>
in the US I am glad to live on the east side of the Atlantic ocean.
<br>
Hope the Americans don't wait 'till witch hunting starts.
