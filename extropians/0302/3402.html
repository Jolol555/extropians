<p><em>&gt; The transactional interpretation of QM uses retarded waves. Worth a look,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; other annoyances out of the window. As I understand it, it falls down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because a lot of other physical theories (outside my area of specialty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunately) demand that retarded waves don't exist or don't exist in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large numbers relative to advanced waves.
</em><br>
<p>You may not be able to get rid of Many-Worlds so easily.  I've seen
<br>
it suggested that the TI and other causal/deterministic quantum
<br>
interpretations like that of Bohm actually embed Many-Worlds in a
<br>
hidden form.
<br>
<p>The idea is that in the full MWI, we calculate what happens using the
<br>
Schrodinger equation.  Now, when there is a measurement, the equation
<br>
&quot;decoheres&quot; or splits into two causally discrete parts.  Each part can be
<br>
thought of as a universe which goes its separate way, unaffected by the
<br>
other part.  However, measurements are not perfect.  Hence decoherence is
<br>
never absolute, and therefore one universe does have an effect on another,
<br>
albeit an infinitisimal one in practice for macroscopic measurements.
<br>
<p>But the interference is still there, in the equations.  Any theory which
<br>
follows the mathematics of the Schrodinger equations, which I am pretty
<br>
sure the TI does, must get the same results as the MWI.  The TI denies
<br>
the existence of the other universes, but their effects on the one &quot;real&quot;
<br>
branch of the wave function are still there mathematically as much as
<br>
in the MWI.  They have to be there, because these are just different
<br>
interpretations of the same mathematics.
<br>
<p>Therefore, if you look sufficiently closely at the Transactional
<br>
Interpretation, you see other worlds.  That is, you have to calculate the
<br>
effects of other worlds in order to get a perfect calculation of the One
<br>
True Wave Function, which is the one we see in this world.  In effect,
<br>
the reality of the other worlds is denied by fiat in this interpretation.
<br>
We have to calculate as if they were there, but we simply declare that
<br>
they do not exist.
<br>
<p>This is not very attractive philosophically.  If we have to calculate
<br>
the effects of other worlds in order to model our own world, what right
<br>
have we to deny their existence?  That is an arbitrary and unrealistic
<br>
step.
<br>
<p>Anyway, that's the argument I have heard.  I don't actually know the
<br>
TI well enough to be certain that it applies to that case, but it makes
<br>
pretty good sense to me.  The Schrodinger equation strongly predicts
<br>
the existence of other worlds, and any interpretation which accepts the
<br>
reality of that equation has to be prepared to deal with the reality
<br>
of many worlds.  Most other interpretations sweep this under the rug
<br>
because it is only implicit and not explicit, but look closely enough
<br>
and it is there.
