-----Original Message-----

From: Damien Broderick [mailto:<a href="mailto:thespike@earthlink.net?Subject=RE:%20Iraq%20from%202%20Aussie%20points%20of%20view:">thespike@earthlink.net</a>] 
<br>
<p>&quot;The trouble with deciding whether or not a war is just is that it is
<br>
usually only possible to know when it is over. Most people would now agree
<br>
that World War II (but not the Vietnam War) was a just war. What if Saddam
<br>
is just as dangerous as Hitler was?&quot;
<br>
<p>As myself and others have frequently noted on this list, it is logical and
<br>
rational to consider the vietnam war as a just effort, and reasons for
<br>
thinking otherwise have so far seemed to be internally inconsistent, biased,
<br>
or ignorant of many of the events in Indochina.  But I of course agree that
<br>
'most people' do indeed consider the vietnam war as not just.  I have
<br>
wondered what 'most people' think of the Korean war, since they were so
<br>
similar, but I havent heard much on that.  It seems, from my limited
<br>
experience, 'most people' don't think much at all about the Korean war, even
<br>
enough to have an opinion on it.  
<br>
<p>But popular opinion doesn't not make something just or un just, as this is
<br>
the fallacy of 'voting = freedom' In unchecked system the majority can (and
<br>
do) vote away the rights of the minority.  In Vietnam the North attempted to
<br>
vote away by majority the right of the South to exist, in the US decades ago
<br>
the rights of minorities were easily voted away based on arbitrary traits,
<br>
today many rights of minority idealogies are readily voted away by the
<br>
majority in the US (atheists, people who choose to behave in ways not
<br>
socially condoned by the majority, and even extropians, who are forbidden by
<br>
law to combat with their intellect and determination the imprisonment that
<br>
their arbitrary set of genes places on them with enhancement treatments)  I
<br>
am sure similar events occur in many other countries consider 'modern'  For
<br>
me, these arent modern enough.  
<br>
<p>To consider something just or unjust we can not resort to popular opinion,
<br>
we must base that on a set of ethical principles, not moral relatives and
<br>
vague appeals to popularity, ignorance, or authority.  With that in mind,
<br>
the following text quoted in this email is absolutely deplorable, full of
<br>
half truths, misconceptions, and outright propoganda.  My comments on this
<br>
text are inserted below.
<br>
<p>&quot;So that's what people mean by a just war?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I guess so. A just war is when you have to defend yourself because someone
<br>
has attacked you. Or when a friendly country is attacked and its leaders ask
<br>
you to help them defend themselves.&quot;
<br>
<p>[In this example Vietnam falls into both of these catagories, it was
<br>
friendly to the US, and was attacked by an aggressive neighbor, and asked
<br>
for help.  Yet our involvment is consider by most to be morally unjust.  It
<br>
is rediculous of this author to imply that the only justifcations for war
<br>
are self defense in an invasion of domestic territory, or at the specific
<br>
request of another *country*.  What if that *country* is not a voice
<br>
representing its people?  (e.g. is a monarchy, theocracy, or dictatorship
<br>
that is despotic)  What if the country is murdering its own people?  Is it
<br>
morally just to stay out or morally *required* to intervene.  Was it moral
<br>
to ignore the plight of the cambodian people under pol pots regime?  Was it
<br>
moral for US congress to make it *illegal* to help the cambodian people?
<br>
Obviously the issua or a moral war is much more complicated then 'are they
<br>
attacking us'  What constites an 'attack'?  What if a state is funding the
<br>
attackers?  What if the attackers only hit targets that are non domestic?
<br>
What if they hit targets of allies?  Is it moral to stand by and watch a
<br>
corrupt murderous tyrant oppress his own people?  Is it moral to stand by
<br>
and allow that same murderous tyrant to control the worlds second largest
<br>
supply of energy?  We keep guns out of the hands of criminals, but claim it
<br>
unjust to yank the power to run armies and launch invasions out of the hands
<br>
of murderers?]
<br>
<p>&quot;So if America attacks Iraq and Iraq defends itself, that wouldn't be a just
<br>
war for America, but it would be for Iraq. And if Iraq asks one of its
<br>
friends to help it defend itself against America, that would be a just war
<br>
for the other country, right?&quot;
<br>
<p>And
<br>
<p>&quot;But if he doesn't attack anyone, how can invading his country be a just
<br>
war? According to you, invading another country would always be wrong.&quot;
<br>
<p>[1st of all, Iraq is not a moral state.  Saddam is a dictator and exists
<br>
only on the oppresion of the people.  A dictator has no *right* to be a
<br>
dictator, and similiarly has no *right* to even exist as a country.  2nd of
<br>
all, this statement ignores that justifacation that Iraq and Saddam
<br>
represent a clear and present danger to the United States and its citizens
<br>
and its allies.  It has numerous weapons of mass destruction that have been
<br>
unaccounted for, Saddam is west hating and has a clear record of murder and
<br>
tyranny.  An act of 'defense' does not require it to be in response as an
<br>
effect to an outright invasion or act of aggression.  Do we wait for our
<br>
neighbor to actually shoot at us before it is moral to shoot at him?  Are we
<br>
morally right to shoot at him just because he is pointing a gun at us?  Or
<br>
do we get concerned when he starts acting in a suspicious manner, murdering
<br>
and raping his kids, building an arsenal in plain view, posting signs and
<br>
stating publicly his his hatred of us, and attempting to acquire large bombs
<br>
and explosives?  The question of the morality of self defense is obviously
<br>
NOT as simple as this author portrays it to be.]
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, usually, but, see, everyone thinks Saddam has these really awful
<br>
weapons . . .&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Worse than America's?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Not worse, no. But, well, because he's a bad guy, people think he might
<br>
decide to use those weapons against some other country some day, so America
<br>
wants to invade his country and destroy the weapons before he can use them.&quot;
<br>
<p>[Even more rediculous.  Only comparing the extent of the damage that a
<br>
weapon can cause COMPLETELY ignores the fact that Our president has to
<br>
answer to his people on this use of these weapons.  He is a representative
<br>
elected official and as such has numerous checks and balances in place to
<br>
ensure he does not become a ruthless tyrant who does whatever he wants and
<br>
kills whomever he wants, including his own people, yet this is the exact
<br>
kind of government in place in Iraq.  Saddam needs no permission and answers
<br>
to no one, he can kill who he wants with whatever he wants.  Our weapon
<br>
aresenal is not sitting aimed at the end crosshair aimed by Bush, Saddam's
<br>
is.  Merely 'having' 'awful weapons' is not enough, being able to use them
<br>
is what matters.  The is the fundamental basis for the efforts to reduce the
<br>
profileferation of nuclear weapons.  Simpleminded automotans unfamiliar with
<br>
world affairs cry 'but the US has them as well!'  But the US can not use
<br>
them whenever and wherever they want, Despotic dictators can, and despotic
<br>
dictators with a clear record of murder, tyranny, and hatred for the US and
<br>
its allies represents a clear threat and a clearly more unique scenerio then
<br>
the Oprah esque question of whether his weapons are just &quot;Worse than
<br>
America's?&quot;]
<br>
<p>&quot;Hugh Mackay is an author and social researcher.&quot;
<br>
<p>[Obviously Mr. Mackay is a paragron of ethical principles and the founding
<br>
father of modern moral behavior.  Or not...]
<br>
<p>See - &quot;The justice of war&quot;
<br>
<p>This was written in regards to the Taliban and Afghanastan, but its points
<br>
on the moral justifaction for war remain valid and much more reasonably
<br>
sound that Mr. Mackay's.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Stephens, &quot;In conducting this war, America must use the
<br>
hierarchy of just-war principles, and refuse to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sidetracked or hamstrung by moral relativists who refuse to acknowledge
<br>
either the justice of the cause or the responsibility&quot;
