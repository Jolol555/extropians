Lee, I was thinking that if I was a European, against the war; how would I 
<br>
punish the US? If all they can do is hold demonstrations and complain, they 
<br>
will be seen, on all future occasions, as people who can be easily dismissed, 
<br>
if not ignored. This summation includes future estimations of reactions to 
<br>
the lost lives of Iraqi civilians, perhaps the suicide of Saddam in his 
<br>
Fuhrer Bunker, and perhaps a WMD strike at US forces, or the United States 
<br>
itself. 
<br>
<p>If all the opponents of this coming war can do is protest, and not persuade, 
<br>
then they will be rendered as inconsequential. As pundit, William Safire once 
<br>
noted: &quot;Nothing is as powerful as power&quot; and if those that demonize the US 
<br>
cannot successful retaliate, then their complaints are moot. I was trying to 
<br>
engage in some brains-storming with the other side, but that is not going to 
<br>
happen, as a direct response would identify the weakness of their position. 
<br>
Notice I do not care to invoke &quot;moral&quot; in this analysis.
<br>
<p>Sincerely, Mitch the Transhumanist 
<br>
(caterer to Yog Sothoth's Sweet Sixteen!)
