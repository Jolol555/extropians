Falling prey to machines - Can sentient machines evolve?

========================================================

<br>
<p>It's coming, but when? From Garry Kasparov to Michael Crichton, both
<br>
fact and fiction are converging on a showdown between man and machine.
<br>
But what does a leading artificial intelligence expert--the world's
<br>
first computer science PhD--think about the future of machine
<br>
intelligence? Will computers ever gain consciousness and take over the
<br>
world? &quot;Computer sentience is possible,&quot; said John Holland, professor of
<br>
electrical engineering and computer science and professor of psychology
<br>
at the University of Michigan. &quot;But for a number of reasons, I don't
<br>
believe that we are anywhere near that stage right now.&quot;

<br>
<p>Even without life extension advances, you can live to 90 and above
<br>
without forgetting friends' names or getting lost in your own
<br>
neighbourhood. A new Mayo Clinic study shows that memory can be sharp in

many people 90 to 99 years old, and that a significant percentage of

nonagenarians are free of dementia.

<br>
<p>Scientists have found a new way in which exercise may protect against
<br>
heart disease. Increased blood flow can mimic the powerful
<br>
anti-inflammatory actions of certain glucocorticoid steroid drugs,
<br>
according to researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Institute
<br>
for Medicine and Engineering. The researchers discovered that an
<br>
increase in shear stress - the drag force exerted by blood flowing over
<br>
endothelial cells that line blood vessels - results in the same sort of
<br>
anti-inflammatory events normally associated with high doses of steroids.

Bridging the â??Power Gapâ?? - Fuel-Cell Technology

<p>ABC News - Laptop and portable computers are getting faster and more

powerful processors. Bright, colorful display screens are appearing on
<br>
ever-smaller cell phones. And handheld computers are turning into
<br>
wireless radios to send and receive Internet data. But all of these

snazzy features have at least one thing in common: They demand lots of

electrical power. And experts say current rechargeable-battery
<br>
technology hasn't progressed at the same pace as these other portable
<br>
technologies, leaving a so-called power gap. But bridging that gap may

now be possible through fuel cells, a clean-energy technology that

produces electricity from the chemical reactions between hydrogen and
