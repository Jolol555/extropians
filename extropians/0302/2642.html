Wei mentioned Greg Egan's fictional Qusp, a computer for running an AI
<br>
in a deterministic way.  I made some comments on this concept on the
<br>
everything-list, which you can read at
<br>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list%40eskimo.com/msg04203.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list%40eskimo.com/msg04203.html</a>.
<br>
I didn't think the idea made that much sense when I wrote that, but on
<br>
second thought I can see a possible reason for it.
<br>
<p>The thing is, the Qusp is actually just an ordinary computer, as Wei
<br>
describes, something that does calculations in the same was as a Turing
<br>
machine or any other deterministic calculation model.  All of our computers
<br>
today would be Qusps, at least if we had AI programs to run on them.  So
<br>
what was there to design?
<br>
<p>My new thought is to imagine that in this future time, all computers
<br>
are quantum computers.  QCs are superior to classical computers in many
<br>
ways, but today we can't really build them.  Let us suppose that in a
<br>
few decades the technical problems are solved.  Then it is plausible
<br>
that this technology would be used for all high-performance computers.
<br>
<p>In that case the inventor of the Qusp might have a point, in that AI
<br>
programs running on the computers of his day have an inherent quantum
<br>
randomness due to the fact that they are running on QCs.  And likewise it
<br>
is plausible that our own brains are subject to quantum randomness due to
<br>
the messy and chaotic chemistry that is going on below the neural level.
<br>
Building a truly deterministic computer for the purpose of running an
<br>
AI would be a novel idea in that context.
<br>
<p>So he wants to make a deterministic computer.  Of course he can't just
<br>
dust off an old Pentium design from the year 2000!  That would be as
<br>
slow as an abacus compared to the computers of his time.  The challenge
<br>
is to come up with a new computer architecture that can match the
<br>
performance of the QCs in running an AI, without being subject to
<br>
the quantum non-determinism that is so essential to their operation.
<br>
Maybe he does still use quantum effects, but he has to do so cleverly
<br>
so that the high level brain functions are fully deterministic.
<br>
<p>I think Robin Hanson wrote a paper some years ago about how QCs could
<br>
speed up AIs.  They halve the depth of search trees, for example,
<br>
and searching is one of the key paradigms underlying many approaches
<br>
to AI.  It could be far from trivial to achieve this kind of performance
<br>
improvement while maintaining determinism.
<br>
<p>So I do think there is at least some justification for Egan imagining
<br>
a society where making a Qusp would be a project someone might try.
<br>
I still don't think that it really solves the problem of deciding things
<br>
both ways, or that that is truly a problem anyone should worry about.
<br>
But I acknowledge that some people do worry about it, so it does make
<br>
sense for Egan to write a story about the first guy who makes such a
<br>
machine, and the first AI who grows up with a Qusp as her brain.
