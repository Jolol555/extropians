<p>It really depends on how dark it gets for how long.  The Sagan lengthy
<br>
nuclear winter hypothesis has been fairly disproven I believe.
<br>
<p>First, many of the below canopy plants stand a good chance of surviving.
<br>
They are adapted to very low light conditions -- unless the &quot;winter&quot;
<br>
created *really* extended, totally dark conditions, some sunlight would
<br>
still make it through the clouds/fog.  Then you have to consider rain
<br>
forest plants -- these spend much of their time under a lack of direct
<br>
sun (in Seattle this is 7-8 months a year even not being in a rain
<br>
forest).  Finally, if the temperatures drop there are many plants
<br>
from tundra and high altitude environments that will just migrate
<br>
southward and to lower altitudes respectively.
<br>
<p>It might also depend what time of the year the nuclear exchange
<br>
took place.  Many plants, particularly in temperate zones store
<br>
a lot of their resources in their roots during the winter.
<br>
Provided some sunlight returns by the spring they are likely
<br>
to recover fairly well.  Equatorial forests do not do this
<br>
but the under-canopy growth should stand a fighting chance.
<br>
A better question might be how the &quot;endarkenment&quot; might
<br>
impact rainfall.  Less sunlight means less evaporation means
<br>
less rain (even though the small atmospheric particles might
<br>
be better at seeding increased rainfall).  The plants are
<br>
likely to suffer more from a lack of water (which drives
<br>
photosynthesis) than a lack of sunlight.
<br>
