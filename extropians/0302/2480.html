<p>
The classic reason for parallel universes to be depressing is because they
<br>
negate free will. No matter what &quot;you&quot; decide to do here, somewhere else
<br>
every other possible choice (and action) is made by &quot;you&quot; (and by your
<br>
environment). Here, while you are eating your breakfast, somewhere else an
<br>
infinite amount of instances of yourself are shooting themselves in the
<br>
head. Or picking their nose. Or shaving a hampster. So what ultimately
<br>
constitutes you, if your decisions are diluted by the effects of infinity?
<br>
<p>Personally, I think that in a mwi setting, you can see yourself as an
<br>
extended probability cloud, across all universes containing you. Even though
<br>
you may take each possible course of action in infinitely many instances of
<br>
yourself, a random finite sample would see some actions occuring far more
<br>
frequently than others. You could measure that 90% of you perform action X,
<br>
9% perform action Y, and all other possibilities crowd into the remaining
<br>
1%. If action X is the one you agree with, then there is still a strong
<br>
sense of personal integrity to be found. Maybe X is an heroic sacrifice?
<br>
That 90% of any sample of you would make it should be uplifting, even if
<br>
there are an infinite amount of you that don't. Perhaps there were
<br>
extenuating circumstances in many of those other cases, anyway, that made
<br>
the choice incorrect or irrelevant? They do diverge, after all.
<br>
<p>So I think there is still room for a sense of self in the face of an
<br>
extended multiverse. It just requires a relaxation / modification of your
<br>
self concept. Hey, it's arbitrary anyway :-)
