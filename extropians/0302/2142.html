That's odd. Javien Forum truncated my last message, but the copy I 
<br>
sent back to myself was OK. 
<br>
Anyway, here is the missing bit of my previous message.
<br>
---------------------------------
<br>
<p><p>From the US point of view there are many disadvantages to small cars, of
<br>
course.
<br>
<p>More people die in small cars than in big cars. (Not by being crushed by
<br>
SUVs as you might think, but by driving into solid objects). The more
<br>
crushable metal surrounding you, the safer you will be. So in USA,
<br>
people in SUVs will tend to live longer.
<br>
<p>Small engines mean a different style of driving. You tend not to burn
<br>
rubber between traffic lights. A small car can cruise at 80 mph on the
<br>
freeway, but it will take some 10-20 seconds longer to reach that speed
<br>
from a standing start. So in USA, you have to get rid of the 'Dukes of
<br>
Hazard' attitude before they will even think about a small car.
<br>
<p>Small cars tend to be noisier than big luxury cars. Thick soundproofing
<br>
and thick carpets add weight, which small cars don't like. That said, in
<br>
normal use, it isn't a problem. Especially if you have your boombox
<br>
blasting out heavy metal rock music.
<br>
<p>Small cars have no room for a gun rack. So, obviously they are out of
<br>
the question for middle America. :-)
<br>
<p>To sum up, even if petrol prices in USA double or triple, it will take
<br>
years before the American public will want small cars and dealers will
<br>
be able to provide them.
<br>
<p>Drive carefully, BillK
