<p><p>Because people keep asking, I'll submit the following. Please note 
<br>
that it would not have helped one iota last Saturday. But it at least 
<br>
puts the STS program in a better light.
<br>
<p>The Inflight Crew Escape System
<br>
<p>There are two types of aborts for the shuttle: intact aborts, and 
<br>
contingency aborts. Intact means the shuttle comes back to Earth in 
<br>
controlled flight and lands, &quot;contingency&quot; means that it does not.. 
<br>
In the event of needing to make a contingency abort after launch 
<br>
(after a major failure by say, one or more main engines early in 
<br>
ascent) the crew is supposed to utilize &quot;the inflight crew escape 
<br>
system&quot; before the orbiter ditches.
<br>
<p>The system involves pyrotechnic jettison of a pressure release valve, 
<br>
then the main side hatch, the deployment of an escape pole, and one 
<br>
by one egress of the vehicle via an attached lanyard/harness to said 
<br>
pole. The pole gets the crewmember to clear the left wing (beneath) 
<br>
after which they can open a parachute which is built into their crew 
<br>
altitude protection suit, among other things.
<br>
<p>The software for the orbiter can be commanded by the flight crew to 
<br>
&quot;maintain stable level flight&quot; which will maintain conditions optimum 
<br>
for bailout (15 degree angle of attack) the operation can be 
<br>
conducted with no one at the helm. Obviously this assumes a health 
<br>
shuttle as well.
<br>
<p>The system is only meant to function at approx. 25,000 feet or less, 
<br>
and at a speed of 230 mph (200 knots) or less.
<br>
<p>It is practiced, and should take 90 seconds for a full compliment of 
<br>
eight to bail out. Optimally, all crew are out by 10,000 feet.
<br>
