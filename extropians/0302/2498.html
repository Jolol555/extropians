Last week I was thinking about a quote of Giordano Bruno
<br>
whose vision of space was homogeneous, infinite, and 
<br>
populated by infintely many worlds:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a single general space, a single vast immensity which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we may freely call Void: in it are innumerable globes like this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one on which we live and grow; this space declare to be infinite,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since neither reason, convenience, sense-perception nor nature
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assign to it a limit.
<br>
<p>This is quite wonderful.  I think that he is the first person
<br>
to announce the complete end of anthropocentrism (in the sense
<br>
of there being nothing so special about us or Earth in the
<br>
whole cosmos).
<br>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, over the last decades it had gradually
<br>
dawned on me that despite all the interesting topologies one
<br>
hears about for our universe, no one had quite proclaimed that
<br>
the whole thing was finite.
<br>
<p>Yesterday I did a little calculation:  say that there are 10^51
<br>
atoms in the Earth, and suppose that morphologically there is
<br>
one Earth per galaxy.  Then we have, going in a straight line
<br>
from here about one Earth every two million light years.
<br>
<p>But of course, all those Earth-like planets up to geological
<br>
similarity cannot be expected to have people.  To complete
<br>
Bruno's vision I supposed that any configuration of the 10^51
<br>
atoms to be equally probably (and an extremely conservative
<br>
bound).  There would be about 10^51!  (that is, 10^51 factorial)
<br>
such configurations.  This is fewer than 10^51^51, which is
<br>
less than 10^10^53, a number that is so vast that if you
<br>
multiply it by a million light-years, you don't change its
<br>
value.  Thus, amazingly enough (or so I thought), one must
<br>
encounter a world exactly like this one in any direction
<br>
you go, if you go about 10^10^53 light years.
<br>
<p>But Amara suggests
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Astrophysics, abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astro-ph/0302131
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://it.arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302131">http://it.arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302131</a>
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; From: Max Tegmark &lt;<a href="mailto:max@hep.upenn.edu?Subject=Re:%20Cosmology%20Question">max@hep.upenn.edu</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Date: Fri, 7 Feb 2003 01:39:52 GMT   
</em><br>
<p>a new Tegmark essay.  Almost in the very first paragraph Tegmark
<br>
announces that you will almost surely find an Earth exactly like
<br>
this one only 10^10^29 meters from here!  A fantastically nice
<br>
reduction of my crude estimate.  (And, as any mega-mathematician
<br>
will tell you, whether you use meters or light-years when dealing
<br>
with this kind of magnitude is entirely immaterial.)
<br>
<p>Now (unless you were a cryonicist or other immortalist), would
<br>
you get at all excited to learn that there was an Earth almost
<br>
exactly like this one only 200 ly distant?
<br>
<p>You would?  Why?  What's the practical difference between 200ly
<br>
and 10^10^53ly?  An erudite off-list correspondent emphasized to
<br>
me in an email exchange that anything further away than 10^15
<br>
ly is beyond our event horizon, so we can't ever learn anything
<br>
about worlds 10^10^53 light years away, and so who cares?  Well,
<br>
I do.  It feels warm and comfy to know that only 10^10^53 ly
<br>
away another one of me is pounding out this same email.  Gives
<br>
me a sense of real community.
