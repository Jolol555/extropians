</em><br>
<p>Yes, well, other antidepressants also have rare side effects, including
<br>
(possibly) homicide and suicide in the case of SSRI's. 
<br>
<p>But again this is not a discussion of the merits of different classes of
<br>
antidepressants.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Okay I will offer a few abstracts below on that subject, but as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wrote above this is really beside the point. I'm not interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; defending selegiline only as an antidepressant. Its key value to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; transhumanists and others here is that it is a potent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; neuroprotectant, a cognitive aid, and a potential agent of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; extension.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### &quot;Potential&quot; is the key word here. So far there is no proof of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extension in humans, and no proof of neuroprotection in PD.
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me? There is EXCELLENT proof that selegiline offers
<br>
neuroprotection in Parkinson's Disease (PD). That is the sole reason it
<br>
is prescribed for the disease, Rafal. It most definitely increases
<br>
life-span in PD patients by protecting dopaminergic neurons.
<br>
<p>Its use for life-extension in healthy humans is admittedly still
<br>
untested and speculative, despite it's proven value for this purpose in
<br>
lab animals, but then the same can be said of CR and everything else in
<br>
the field. 
<br>
<p>It's notable that we are all ultimately destined to become PD patients
<br>
if we live long enough (after about age 40 we lose about 13% of our
<br>
dopaminergic neurons per decade, even without PD). In these terms
<br>
selegiline/deprenyl is clearly an aid to life extension.
