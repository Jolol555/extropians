<p><em>    &gt;Frankly, Saddam as such is none of our business. [...]
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;We would save a LOT more lifes if we dropped the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;sanctions tomorrow
</em><br>
<p>I must be the only member of this list who doesn't know if this war is a
<br>
good idea or not. I do know there are valid reasons to be very nervous about
<br>
it but you haven't addressed any of them. Consider what you wrote above:
<br>
<p>The sanctions started 12 years ago when Saddam invaded Kuwait, in the 6
<br>
months after that before the first war started many people (and you too I'd
<br>
be willing to bet money on) said there should be no war because sanctions
<br>
would work and make him leave Kuwait. Give sanctions a chance they said,
<br>
and now these same people say there shouldn't even be sanctions.
<br>
As dangerous as Saddam is now just imagine if that advise had been followed,
<br>
today he'd still be in Kuwait and because he saw how easy it was he'd almost
<br>
certainly have annexed Saudi Arabia too. If that had happened Saddam would
<br>
have his hand on the throttle of the world economy by controlling the price
<br>
of oil. He'd also be about a trillion dollars richer than he is today, and
<br>
he wouldn't be spending all that money on hospitals and candy for little
<br>
kids I can tell you that. It doesn't sound like a world I'd like to live in
<br>
and that's why Saddam is my business.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;continued inspections
</em><br>
<p>The only reason the inspectors are allowed into Iraq is the threat of
<br>
military force breathing down Saddam's neck, the instant that force is
<br>
reduced the inspectors will be kicked out so fast it will make your head
<br>
spin and we'll be back to square one regarding his weapons of mass
<br>
destruction. It's interesting that just a few years ago the USA was saying
<br>
Iraq should not be allowed to sell more oil until the inspectors are let in
<br>
and France said inspectors were not important and Saddam should sell as much
<br>
oil as he wanted, now France says inspectors are vitally important and the
<br>
USA is just greedy for oil. Odd.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;It is guaranteed  that many times that number of lives will be
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;lost in the war
</em><br>
<p>Guaranteed by who, you? Your prediction of the number of lives
<br>
that would be lost in the Afghanistan war was lousy.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; increased likelihood of terrorism
</em><br>
<p>That would imply that the reason there has not been a terrorist attack in
<br>
the USA in the year and a half since 911 is that Islamic fundamentalists no
<br>
longer hate us sufficiently. I don't buy it. The reason is a lack of ability
<br>
(so far) not a lack of will.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Many are there because this war has not been sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;justified for the costs in lives, finances,
</em><br>
<p>Ok, I over spoke before, you did  have one legitimate question and I don't
<br>
know the answer to it. I don't worry about making terrorists mad at us and I
<br>
don't worry about the injustice of depriving Saddam of the dictatorship of
<br>
Iraq, I do worry about civilians killed be nerve gas, house to house
<br>
fighting in Baghdad, Smallpox, Iraq turning into a Arab Yugoslavia, and 1500
<br>
oil well fires. I'm not saying any of that will happen I'm saying it might.
<br>
There are plenty of valid reasons to be apprehensive no need to make up BS
<br>
ones. There are dangers in going to war and dangers in not going to war,  I
<br>
just hope Bush is right about which is greater.
