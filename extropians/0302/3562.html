<p>
Nova, the science and technology TV program, has
<br>
demonstrated to the entire world some relatively
<br>
easy and cheap ways to spread radiation using
<br>
any metropolitan subway.  They correctly reported
<br>
that the subway could be made effectively useless
<br>
even with an amount of radiation far below what
<br>
would pose an actual significant health danger.
<br>
<p>Some months ago I speculated similarly, that a
<br>
terrorist could easily obtain some type of legal
<br>
and harmless radioactive material such as Americium
<br>
from smoke detectors, power it, spread it using
<br>
ordinary commerically available fireworks, then
<br>
watch the proles panic.  Geiger counters do not
<br>
actually identify the type of radiation, only
<br>
that there is radiation of some kind.  If a news
<br>
agency reported that a low level of radiation
<br>
is discovered in the subway, the people wouldn't
<br>
even read the second line, that the level is
<br>
considered harmless.
<br>
<p>I have never seen it used as an argument against
<br>
mass transit, but we should consider that especially
<br>
subways are so vulnerable to terrorists they might
<br>
already be considered a very bad investment of
<br>
public funds.  spike
