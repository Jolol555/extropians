Well, San Francisco may not have been build after the car, but it 
<br>
certainly grew to it's present size after the car.  Currently there are 
<br>
appearanly more cars than parking spaces in the city.  Ouch!  And this 
<br>
considering that the city is served by BART, Busses, and Trains.  It's 
<br>
true that there was a period during the 1950's when cars were the vogue, 
<br>
and the transit rails were ripped up.  (Courtesy of lobbying via GM, by 
<br>
the way.)  Within a decade people were really regretting this.
<br>
<p>OTOH, San Francisco sits on a peninsula, and occupies the entire tip.  
<br>
It can't expand any direction but up.  Perhaps anywhere that land 
<br>
becomes valuable enough to justify skyscrapers can also justify mass 
<br>
transit.  This doesn't mean that it's always a good answer, but it 
<br>
certainly isn't always a bad answer.  In an effort to cut down cars 
<br>
coming into the city, bridge tolls are only collected on the way in, 
<br>
certain lanes of the highway are restricted to cars that have 3 or more 
<br>
people, etc.  These measures aren't enough.  This isn't an argument that 
<br>
mass transit is cheap (though sponsors of cars never seem to count the 
<br>
cost of the roadways), but rather that autos don't fill the need.  
<br>
Parking costs of $2 an hour don't keep the cars down to a useable level 
<br>
(and private garages get that price).
<br>
<p>Nobody can claim that cars aren't more desireable to each individual 
<br>
than transit is.  The $20 a day surcharge proves that (there are various 
<br>
costs to the driver and the transit rider that I'm not listing, and this 
<br>
is a very rough estimate).  But even for that price the city can't 
<br>
support them.  It's true that the transit is subsidized, but not enough 
<br>
to get enough of the people to ride it... (there's a problem here:  if 
<br>
you make it too cheap, then people don't think it's worth caring for, 
<br>
and you get increased problems with vandalism of various sorts.  So you 
<br>
can't just use taxes on cars to subsidize the transit...besides, the car 
<br>
drivers are still the large majority, and they wouldn't vote for it even 
<br>
to make it possible to park.)
<br>
<p>The result is that people who really NEED to use cars, salesmen, etc. 
<br>
for example, are greatly hindered.  This will probably lead eventually 
<br>
to the development of cities based around each of the major surburbs.  
<br>
E.g., San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley.  But they are already showing 
<br>
signs of heading the same way.  The population is less, but the streets 
<br>
are laid out.  The major streets have already been widened, some of them 
<br>
twice.  The orchards have been gone for decades.  And the air pollution 
<br>
is already worse than San Francisco, because they are cut off from the 
<br>
ocean breezes.  And for some silly reason when they implemented their 
<br>
local mass transit, they used a different gague of rail than the BART 
<br>
system does.  So it's impossible to make smooth connections between the 
<br>
systems.  The worst of both choices!
