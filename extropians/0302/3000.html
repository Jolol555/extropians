I wonder if subvocalization is really a problem for speed. I know a blind
<br>
guy who listens to the Web &amp; email via a machine reader - and he has the
<br>
speed turned up so fast I couldn't even make out it was speech. It's
<br>
marvelous - he can process speech at a much faster rate than anyone can
<br>
speak in natural language. It seems then one could subvocalize also at a
<br>
high rate of speed...

<em>&gt; &gt; What are the best ways to increase reading speed. Does increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; speed have drawbacks. Do the computer programs give you results, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so how much are they exaggerating the results they advertize.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let me know thanks, Nate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The trick to speed reading is learning how not to &quot;sound out&quot; the words in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's mind as one reads. But as above it pleases me to sound out the words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my mind as I read, and so I lost interest in speed reading. &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nate, I second gts's comments, I read often and have read a lot about speed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading but was quite skeptical of it.  The other day I gave it a shot while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading something I didn't particular enjoy but needed to read.  You have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrate on not subvocalizing as you read (I understand some people do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, and I wonder if deaf from birth people read faster) because reading in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that manner limits your speed to the subvocalization speed.  As I understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, the process is something like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) brain recognizes word through pattern recognition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) word is subvocalized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) word entered into memory (kind of)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When looking at it like that, its hard to understand what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subvocalization is for, since part of recognizing a word necessarily entails
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognizing that word!  So anyway, I tried it the other day and made a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrated effort to not subvocalize but I lead my eyes in the reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a finger (another tactic often suggested) After each sentence I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop and attempt to repeat the sentence, to my astonishment I found I often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could repeat it word for word, with more accuracy than if I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subvocalized.  The retentioned seemed to be better than the conventional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; type of reading, but it is very difficult to get used to reading without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subvocalization, its like soaking up information without your upper level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conciousness being aware of it.  I think that might be the role
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subvocalization plays, your super fast pattern recognition and information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing capable brain telling your relatively dimwitted serial process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated 'conciousness' that you are in fact reading.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I need to practice more, but I keep tending back to subvocalized reading as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gts mentions, because it seems more enjoyable?
