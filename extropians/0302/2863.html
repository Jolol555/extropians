<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Rafal hangs his hat on a single study in which selegiline (deprenyl)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; slowed the progression of Parkinson's disease symptoms (a remarkable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; result!) but in which the drug was not found to actually extend the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; life of those same Parkinson's patients.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### I explained before but can do it again: selegiline did not slow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the progression of symptoms, merely symptomatically delayed the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to levodopa, as shown by the loss of efficacy during washout.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I stand by my words. Selegiline delayed the time to which symptoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become severe enough to require treatment with levodopa. That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease symptoms&quot; by anyone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition, Rafal.
</em><br>
<p>### No it isn't. The symptoms appeared at the same rate, but were delayed. I
<br>
was referring to the absence of any influence on the progression of the
<br>
underlying disease process. Slowing the progression of a neurodegenerative
<br>
disorder is when a treatment slows down the loss of neurons. It can be
<br>
postulated when even after the withdrawal of the treatment (the washout),
<br>
there is some improvement over placebo.
<br>
<p>If a treatment produces strictly symptomatic relief, it covers up the loss
<br>
of neurons by e.g. activating remaining neurons or other compensatory
<br>
mechanisms. However, once the treatment is withdrawn, the underlying loss is
<br>
again fully manifested, and the patient returns to the same state as the
<br>
placebo patient. This is exactly what happened with DATATOP patients during
<br>
washout.
<br>
<p>Additionally, there are more supporting data for this explanation - the time
<br>
to dyskinesias. Dyskinesias develop during treatment with levodopa when the
<br>
number of remaining dopaminergic neurons becomes critically low. It is a
<br>
marker of progression of the disease, independent (probably) of any
<br>
treatment. In DATATOP, both selegiline and placebo patients developed the
<br>
dyskinesias at the same absolute time since the onset of the disease,
<br>
implying (but not proving) that there was no slowing of the process.
<br>
<p>The only difference was a delay in the development of gait freezing, which
<br>
could indicate a slowing of neuronal loss in one of the populations involved
<br>
in gait ignition (premotor cortex?). However, this has a very limited
<br>
clinical significance.
<br>
<p>--------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only disappointing thing about that particular study is that these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patients did not also live longer than those who were treated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levodopa alone. A plethora of research outside of that study supports
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a neuroprotective role for selegiline, and in fact that study did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually disprove such a role.
</em><br>
<p>### It did disprove any clinically significant neuroprotection. See above.
