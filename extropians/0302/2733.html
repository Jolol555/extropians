D. Broderick noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Mitch, you know that `bully' is a word used by victims to condemn such
<br>
thugs.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, America is indeed, a bully to Iraq, and North Korea, and for that matter 
<br>
Serbia's Milosovic. Also Shiite terrorist Iran, I would hope. Yes, indeed. 
<br>
Hopefully we are victimizing the victimizers; those who have thrown the first 
<br>
sucker punch. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;More importantly, perhaps: I thought this was the extropian list, not the
<br>
committee to better ensure American safety.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I would say that Extropianism, and Transhumanism would not survive for long, 
<br>
at this stage, if the US were to disappear, dwindle, or withdraw into 
<br>
isolationism. Many would cheer all three of those occurrences, but I surmise 
<br>
they would not cheer, the ultimate, intermediate results. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;It might be that doing the latter via state military force is by and large 
<br>
a
<br>
prerequisite for the advancement of the extropian agenda, but that is not
<br>
entirely obvious, especially given the large proportion of extropians who
<br>
ardently dislike centralized authority, initiation of force, and so on.
<br>
Damien Broderick
<br>
<p>Again, Extropianism and Transhumanism would be back-burnered, even more then 
<br>
now, because the EU and whomever would then be greatly involved in what the 
<br>
Anthropologists call &quot;competitions.&quot;  You can't really afford to spend time 
<br>
analyzing the viability of space elevators, or the promise of uploading, when 
<br>
you are forced to defend your boarders. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;[currently in America and not all that eager to see American safety
<br>
compromised]  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>America compromised its own safety by not seeing a danger for what it was and 
<br>
is. Even our current leadership still has let the House of Ibn Saud off the 
<br>
hook for a lot of our deaths on the USS Cole, the embassy bombings, the 
<br>
khobar towers, 9-11, and so forth. This, again, is a problem of preception 
<br>
and political will. Our continuing fault in this case, not Europe's, but 
<br>
ourselves.
