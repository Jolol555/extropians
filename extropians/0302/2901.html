<em>&gt;     &gt; As I and others have pointed out, the so-called Kuwaiti invasion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; was greatly inflated and partially a setup by America. [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, this list is asked to listen to the wisdom of someone who calls the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invasion of Kuwait  &quot;so-called&quot; and the political expertise of someone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says it was somehow (not specified how or why) an American &quot;setup&quot;;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think so.
</em><br>
<p><p>Then don't.  Don't listen and don't bother.  This list?  This 
<br>
list has a vast variety of people and points of view on it 
<br>
regardless of whether you may wish it to more uniformly reflect 
<br>
your own.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;We then inflated what was going on and faked (as later came out)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;satellite evidence of a massive Iraqi Army maneuvering to also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;invade Saudi Arabia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Baloney. He had a massive army and after he swallowed Kuwait he could have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken over Saudi Arabia in just a few days if he wanted to and he certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted to, the only reason he didn't is fear of the USA, and if he knew the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; president was listening to advise from you he would have no fear and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world would be a sadder and more dangerous place today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The evidence of this massive army was doctored. Sorry if you are 
<br>
not informed of this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     &gt;The US and Britain have unilaterally imposed  no-fly zones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well Boo Hoo, poor Saddam has lost some of his power. So this list is asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to listen to the ethical advise of somebody who thinks no fly zones are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral outrage but invading Kuwait is not. I don't think so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Boo Hoo when nations take illegal steps against other nations. 
<br>
Boo Hoo when supposed civilized people do not see this as a 
<br>
problem.  Boo Hoo when the poverty and deaths of hundreds of 
<br>
thousands are excused so glibly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     &gt;and conducted bombing runs on various manufacturing centers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;on the grounds that perhaps they could somehow be used for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;producing weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps? For good or bad very soon now we are going to know for sure if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam has weapons of mass destruction or not, you seem to be predicting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he does not, I'm predicting he does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Predictions are NO REASON for an invasion.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     &gt; Saddam is far less dangerous than Israel or North Korea or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Pakistan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam is the only leader in the world who wants weapons of mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction, invaded his neighbors twice, has a chance to control the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world's supply of oil and has actually used chemical weapons on his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people and on others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Let me get this straight.  Saddam is the ONLY leader who wants 
<br>
WMD?  You must be kidding.  Or haven't you noticed the other 
<br>
nations that wanted and have WMD?  Were you sleeping through the 
<br>
news on N. Korea?  North Korea says it is developing and/or has 
<br>
WMD and it will use them at the slightest provocation, even of 
<br>
sanctions applied.  And we back down.
<br>
<p>We were fully behind the Iraq/Iran war if that is part of what 
<br>
you are referring to.  We helped build up the military strength 
<br>
of Iraq and encouraged them. We have used chemical weapons and 
<br>
have conducted experiements on our own citizens.  Does this mean 
<br>
we should be invaded?  We would like to control the world's 
<br>
supply of oil.  Should we be invaded?  The supposed gassing of 
<br>
the Kurds is actually under some contention as it was during the 
<br>
Iraq/Iran war and the actual gas used judging from the 
<br>
examination of the victims appeared to more likely be of the 
<br>
type employed by Iran.  Military studies at the time pointed 
<br>
this out.  But we conveniently ignore this as it is inconvenient 
<br>
for building up the war fever and justification.
<br>
<p>Frankly, I find the US position and intentions in this matter 
<br>
thoroughly sickening and utterly reprehensible.
