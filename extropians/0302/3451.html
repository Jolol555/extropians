Ron h. replied:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        The truth is that the US gets little oil from the middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; east.  Iraq and the middle east is where our allies France and Germany get
</em><br>
their oil.
<br>
<p>Barbara Lamar had already responded in advance:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It does not matter whether or not the U.S. itself imports
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant amounts of oil from Iraq. A disruption in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;segment of the world's oil supply affects the entire global
</em><br>
<em>&gt;market.
</em><br>
<p>But I thought far and away the more important point Barbara made was this
<br>
chilling comment:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;it seems that far more damage could be done and ultimately more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suffering and death inflicted on Iraq's enemies by torching Iraq's oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fields than by setting off a dirty bomb or turning loose some anthrax
</em><br>
bacteria
<br>
<em>&gt;in a NY subway. The economy of the U.S. is too fragile at the moment to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easily weather a significant increase in the price of oil.
</em><br>
<p>Think seriously about this. The man is a tribal megalomaniac from a machismo
<br>
culture. He spends vast treasure on palaces to glorify himself, his family
<br>
and his affines. Suddenly it seems the game really *is* up.
<br>
<p>What does he do?
<br>
<p>Suppose he wishes to punish the West fearsomely. He has no nuclear weapons
<br>
to explode in NYC, and anthrax is an overblown threat even if he has some
<br>
and a handy cropduster.
<br>
<p>No, he's already got his revenge nicely cooled under the sand. Blow the hell
<br>
out of his oilfields, set the whole damned lot on fire, maybe dumping in
<br>
some radiological material if any's to hand.
<br>
<p>He's dead, sure, but so is the West... As Gully Foyle vowed in THE STARS MY
<br>
DESTINATION, that great hysterical narrative of megalomania: `I kill you
<br>
filthy, Vorga!'
<br>
<p>Might a megalomaniac trapped in a fatal corner think like that? I don't
<br>
know. Will his likely successors know that he will think like that and try
<br>
to nip any such plan in the bud before he and his village pals get a chance
<br>
to put it into effect? Will they be able to?
<br>
<p>Game theory might find this kind of quandary rather too complex and
<br>
uncertain to model.
