</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &quot;as a base for force projection close to the Soviet border&quot;. With no

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; in December 1979. This led to the US and Chinese needing to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the Mujahadeen to expel the Soviets, which in turn led to the rise of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Osama Bin Laden and his cronies. So, to use your logic, the rise of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the terrorism that now threatens US and international security can be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To which Sean Kenny responded:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Iran, 1953: When the government of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nationalized the Anglo-Iranian oil company, the resulting sanctions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the country – led by Great Britain and the United States – resulted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic hardship and political unrest. Fearing that such instability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could result in a communist takeover and concerned about the precedent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of nationalization on American oil companies elsewhere in the Middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; East, agents of the Central Intelligence Agency organized a military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coup in 1953, ousting the elected prime minister. The United States
</em><br>
<em>&gt; returned the exiled Shah to Iran, where he ruled with an iron fist for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than a quarter century. Tens of thousands of dissidents were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortured and murdered by his dreaded SAVAK secret police, organized and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trained by the United States. The repression was largely successful in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiping out the democratic opposition. The SAVAK was less successful in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infiltrating religious institutions, however, so when the revolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finally took place, toppling the Shah in 1979, the formerly secular Iran
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came under the leadership of virulently reactionary and anti-American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islamists. The result of the Islamic revolution was not only the end of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of America’s strongest economic and strategic relationships in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Middle East, but also the hostage crisis of 1979-81, Iranian support for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-American terrorist groups, and a series of armed engagements in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Persian Gulf during the 1980s. Had the United States not overthrown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iran’s constitutional government in 1953 and replaced it with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictatorial Shah, there would not have been the Islamic Revolution and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its bloody aftermath.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I am appreciative of your response, Sean, but I disagree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely with it.
</em><br>
<p><p>According to people I know who escaped from Iran, it is quite 
<br>
accurate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we wish to continue the rotating game of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assigning blame, then I could then say this.
</em><br>
<p>Do you think that is all or even primarily what this is?  To me 
<br>
it looks more like attempting to honestly understand what 
<br>
happened.  It may not be the whole story but it is one important 
<br>
slice of the story.  If it is excluded out of discomfort or 
<br>
disagreement with other takes then our understanding is poorer 
<br>
and we are less likely to reach conclusions and take actions 
<br>
that are actually helpful toward our deepest goals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Had not Islamic fanatics of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the terrorist organization Fedaiyan-e Islam (Devotees of Islam) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assassinated then Iranian Prime Minister Ali Razmara in 1951, Mohammed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mossadegh would never have been appointed Prime Minister in Iran (by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shah, who you heavily criticize, a point I will address shortly). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Razmara staunchly opposed nationalization of the oil companies on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounds that Iran should abide by its international agreements and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because he felt they could not run the oil fields alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Does this though deny the other side or add aspects and 
<br>
dimensions to the unfolding story?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        A continued Razmara administration then would not have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nationalized the oil fields, the sanctions you speak of would never have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurred, and a pro-western regime endorsed by the Western powers would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been continually aided and supported Iran for the foreseeable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future. Therefore, not only are the Islamic fundamentalists to blame for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the chaos in Iran in 1978-79, they are also to blame for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficulties which occurred in the 1950's.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This seems rather silly doesn't it?  You are claiming one 
<br>
assasination is responsible for everything?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;        Let me say now that I am partly to blame for this game of &quot;Who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did what&quot; oneupsmanship. In responding to Mez originally, as is seen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above, I responded more forcefully than perhaps what was appropriate. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took strong issue with his apparent claims that US foreign policy during 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Cold War was somehow intentionally anti-democracy. In my subsequent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussions with Mez we were able to clarify and elaborate on our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positions. Though I did not agree completely with him, I found him to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a fair, thoughtful, and intelligent poster. But, given my initial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction, I am not surprised that Sean replied in the manner in which he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did.
</em><br>
<p>It is well known that we have often acted intentionally 
<br>
anti-democracy in several countries in the world.  It is 
<br>
pointless and unhelpful to deny this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Having addressed the hyperbole on both sides, I would like now to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address my main concern with Sean's post. As I commented to Mez, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot abide judgments passed on US foreign policy that make it appear 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these decisions were being made in a vacuum. To &quot;describe&quot; the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US-Iranian relationship during the Cold War without once mentioning the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soviet Union, as Sean does, is to simply ignore reality. 
</em><br>
<p>Do you then believe the Cold War justifies real terrorism 
<br>
against societies and governments around the world?  That the 
<br>
end, slowing, halting and rolling back Soviet expansion, 
<br>
justified any and all means?  If so, then why would you have 
<br>
trouble admitting just how vile some of the means were?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I find it even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more unfortunate that he did not in his rebuttal address my point, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was that the abdication of the Shah played a direct role in the Soviet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Union's invasion of Afghanistan. It is simply not realistic to suggest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise. The transformation of Iran from a pro-western nation with US 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bases to a nation completely hostile to it had a profound impact on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soviet thinking. All one need do is look at a map of the region.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think your point is rather minor in this fuller context 
<br>
presented, don't you?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Another serious issue I have with Sean's post is his characterization of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the regime of the Shah of Iran. In his post Sean succinctly points out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the methods of repression used by the Shah, methods which would lead to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the imprisonment (and in many cases deaths) of thousands of Iranians 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during his 25 year regime. This was the dark side of the Pahlavi regime, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and something that should be rightfully pointed out. 
</em><br>
<p>Good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, Sean in no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way gives any sort of historical context to his analysis. What third 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world regime of this era did not utilize these tactics? 
</em><br>
<p>But how many of them were proped up so strongly by the US?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Anwar Sadat, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man whose courage to deal with the Israelis is something I greatly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admire, was certainly guilty of this kind of repression. Syngman Rhee 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; executed 2000 suspected Communists in South Korea without trial in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early 1950's. Certainly no regime in the Communist camp could plead 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent to this barbarism. In illustrating that other regimes operated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the same way, I do not seek to excuse or justify the Shah's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repression. I merely mean to make clear that to pretend or ignore that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others didn't is at best ridiculous. 
</em><br>
<p>How is this even relevant?  That other monsters existed did not 
<br>
make the Shah, who we supported, any less monstrous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To allow unfettered dissent in such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a time was to show weakness and vulnerability and sow the seeds of one's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own demise, as the Shah would learn a quarter century later. This was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the unfortunate reality of this era. 
</em><br>
<p>Would you support the US deciding this is the reality and using 
<br>
such means on its own citizens?  The legal instruments that 
<br>
would eventually allow it are being forged even as we discuss 
<br>
this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The majority of nations in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world were not democracies during the 20th Century. A large portion of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the blame for this can be placed on the Soviet Union, which attempted to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foster a climate of the exact opposite system of government throughout 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the globe. To somehow blame repression, or worse a lack of democracy, on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the United States is absurd, as it somehow suggests that the world would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have had more democracies had the US chosen a policy of inaction and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less influence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>When we support and prop up governments making them much less 
<br>
likely to be subject to change by their people, we act 
<br>
anti-democractically and act to repress those who would change 
<br>
their country toward greater democracy.  Influcence and action 
<br>
that increases what we do not want and gets little of what we do 
<br>
want is not very wise action or influence.  Historically we must 
<br>
understand what we actually did and its unintended consequences.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;        He was also determined that his people become a literate one. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literary rate in Iran in 1977 was 85%. Today, it is only 72%, with Iraq 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at 58% and Egypt at 51%. Primary school attendance rose from 270,000 in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1960 to over 10 million in 1977.
</em><br>
<p>The Shah did some great things, sure.  So did the Soviet Union. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that doesn't mean we did not also err greatly in our 
<br>
support for him when we did not do more to stop his very 
<br>
negative and anti-democratic aspects.
<br>
<p>The literacy rate is sad when I think of the current only 88% 
<br>
literacy rate among Caucasians in the US and the approximately 
<br>
65% literacy rate of African Americans that I recently saw 
<br>
reported.
