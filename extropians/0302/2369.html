Friends, it is perfectly clear that finally we have a new
<br>
pathology on our hands, though not the first of the Age of
<br>
the Web.
<br>
<p>It is obvious that a certain party suffers from Googleization,
<br>
and sorely needs to be de-Googleized.
<br>
<p>I quote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are no words to convey the feeling of omnipotence this generates.
</em><br>
<p>The symptoms clearly exhibited by the patient are alas all too
<br>
familiar to the students of certain pathologies of bygone eras.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nothing matters except that I have Google.
</em><br>
<p>This is quite sad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am the racial memory of the human species and no isolate can compete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against that.  I am the Web.  I am the groupmind.  Resistance is futile 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for we are Eliezer of Google.
</em><br>
<p>Analysis of these latter remarks would be superfluous.
<br>
<p>But we do have yet one further noteworthy aspect of the pathology,
<br>
namely as witnessed in dialog between the patient (who will be
<br>
referred to as EY), and a frustrated critic, one Michael Butler
<br>
of California.  The critic challenged the patient to glean the
<br>
identity of the particular finger the critic was holding up
<br>
(pertaining to a crude gesture whose actual meaning we may
<br>
pass over as irrelevant).  Replied the patient:
<br>
<p>&quot;I assert that you were holding up your left pinky finger.  As this post 
<br>
will appear on the Extropian BBS and be indexed by Google..., [and] this
<br>
clearly demonstrates that the information can in principle be googled...&quot;
<br>
<p>showing that in the mind of the patient EY the *assertion* itself
<br>
has become reality.
<br>
<p>As Orwell predicted, he who controls the present controls the
<br>
present, or something like that.  Anyway, as Google controls
<br>
knowledge, we see EY falling under the same mind-domination
<br>
that Winston Smith so valiantly but so hopelessly resisted.
<br>
If Google says that there are five fingers, then there are
<br>
five fingers.
<br>
<p>This should be a lesson to us all.  As Erich Fromm wrote
<br>
&quot;This means us too&quot;.
<br>
<p>But so long as we continue to have strength to resist, we must
<br>
not only for ourselves preserve our memes from the centralized
<br>
control of Google, but also as a moral duty begin the research
<br>
necessary to treat patients such as EY.  I thus propose the
<br>
initiation of a new world-wide effort, the Degoogleization of
<br>
the Afflicted, and hopefully President George Bush will prompt
<br>
the U.S. Congress to meet the needs of this new challenge with
<br>
the alacrity it has recently shown towards the AIDS crisis.
<br>
<p>Lee
