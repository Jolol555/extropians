<em>&gt; &gt;     &gt;  Free speech can sometimes be cheap speech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It usually is, but so what?  If I say bad things about you it will only
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really damaging to you if my reputation is good.  If I have a history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; making similar charges that turned out to be untrue anything I say will
</em><br>
just
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be shrugged off. I think a free market of ideas should determine what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; true and what is not, the idea of some an official body making such a
</em><br>
decree
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gives me the creeps.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I agree, I think that it would be most enlightening to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more about the history of libel and slander laws.
</em><br>
<p>Me too. I did quite a bit of backgrounding on defamation at one point
<br>
by I've forgotten most of the details of what I learnt. When I get a chance
<br>
I'll check out the history a bit more and if it seems interesting I'll post
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can presently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of only two possibilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) Certain powerful individuals were embarrassed by what their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political opponents were able to reveal about them, and wanted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them shut up permanently.  So these individuals got behind laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to forcibly suppress denunciations against them.
</em><br>
<p>I think there is some truth in this but its not the whole picture. I don't
<br>
think contemporary Western democracies are configured in such a
<br>
way that a relatively few people can seriously threaten free speech.
<br>
Free speech has too many chamipons (journalists, civil lib types).
<br>
&nbsp;It can take a few bruises and scrapes here and there but I don't think
<br>
it is seriously in danger of  being lost as a general principle. Too many
<br>
capable and interested people make use of and defend it. In
<br>
democracies certain sorts of power can concentrate in the hands of a
<br>
relative few but I don't think the power to censor others in a serious
<br>
way is one of those sorts of powers. Could be wrong though certainly
<br>
free speech in Nazi Germany would have been somewhat limited but
<br>
whether free speech or democracy was curtailed first I've not really
<br>
thought through.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) The monopoly of information---i.e. newspapers---was so severe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it was thought by many prudent legislators that such power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed restraint.  Otherwise, at certain key moments those newspapers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had the power to critically damage a candidate.
</em><br>
<p>Newspapers, especially large circulation papers in the hands of private
<br>
owners must have had an impact on free speech at some stages when
<br>
the technology was rolling out that was greater than at earlier times.
<br>
<p>One vote each in a democracy still pretty much holds. But the real
<br>
point is that we have disproportionate power to influence each others
<br>
voting habits and opinions. A person with a private newspaper with
<br>
a high circulation clearly has a means of influencing and defaming
<br>
(especially in the absence of defamation laws) disproportionate
<br>
to other citizen voters. Without defamation laws it would seem that
<br>
people would need to have quite deep pockets for counter
<br>
propaganda in newspapers if they didn't own a newspaper of their
<br>
own. I'd reckon Adam Smith would hardly be impressed with this
<br>
as a model of economic efficiency, when defamation laws, sensibly
<br>
construed allow for better (more effective less wasteful) allocations
<br>
of societies resources.
