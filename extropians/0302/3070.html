Mez opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;You're right.  I'm willing to give the US a certain amount of leeway
<br>
for cold war events given the context.  But in the here and now I want
<br>
a US foreign policy that is focused on spreading the qualities that
<br>
make this country great.  I haven't seen that.  We're still propping
<br>
up corrupt dictators.  And when we see a country like Iran actually
<br>
making significant headway towards democracy (it's more democratic
<br>
than many of our so-called allies like Saudi Arabia or Egypt), we
<br>
respond by alienating them and strengthening the hardliners.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>No disagreement with what Egypt and Saudi have produced. Those two regimes 
<br>
need changing bigtime, especially Saudi, but also Baathist Egypt.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;.  What's
<br>
more, such a president would get my support for an invasion of Iraq
<br>
with the intent of putting in place a democratic government that does
<br>
not oppress it's people and is less likely to pursue nuclear weapons.
<br>
The current US administration doesn't meet my bar though.
<br>
<p>mez&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am not sure one can impose a Republic, any more than the accidental 
<br>
republic imposed by the Germans after WW1. Nobody really wanted it, so it was 
<br>
unstable when challanged by the Great Depression.  What we can do is pump the 
<br>
oil for the Iraqi people, rather then Saddam's palaces and weapons, and thus 
<br>
buy them some chance to stablize and develop. Perhaps a third way, not 
<br>
Jihadi, not Baathist, but a republic when an emphasis on capitalism rather 
<br>
the the Wahabbist Mercantilist state.  Also selling oil puts the Wahabs on a 
<br>
jihad diet--less cash for mullahs, and bombers. Borrowing a phrase from Billy 
<br>
Clinton: &quot;Lets not make perfect, the enemy of better.&quot; Of course he may have 
<br>
been saying that to Monica at the time.
<br>
<p>Lovecraftilly Yours
