How will Nano asseblers really work outside labs? It would be very difficult 
<br>
to build a nano assebler that would be able to deal with all the different 
<br>
evolutionary micro organism. It would have a hard time dealing with self 
<br>
organization of it's own molecular structure let alone the diverse attacks 
<br>
from other micro organism. Plus most micro organism really only function 
<br>
well at a certain tempature and ph. It seems highly improbable that a nano 
<br>
assebler can be created and be functional in a non-isolated enviroment. Why? 
<br>
because evolution would have already created them a thousand times over.
<br>
<p>It would be much more likely to incorporate a nano assembler in some type of 
<br>
existing organism. However this would be very difficult for the nano 
<br>
asseblers to do anything too complex as the organism would determining how 
<br>
they assembled together. It might require many stages of many slightly 
<br>
altered micro organism to get one simple effect.
<br>
<p>When they do get these nano asseblers up and running in labs it will be 
<br>
interesting to see their evolution occuring even at that level. Maybe after 
<br>
the first one replicates 10 to the 100th power they will evolve enough. But 
<br>
will they still be funtional? If we select the functional ones to survive 
<br>
will they evolve enough?
<br>
<p>I'm sure there are many things I'm overlooking here,
<br>
Thanks for your help, Nate
