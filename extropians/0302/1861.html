<p>
When sad things happen, I increase the abstraction level. The disaster 
<br>
has something to tell us. 
<br>
<p>The real tragedy here is that a single accident can be so devastating. 
<br>
If seven good people have been killed in a car crash it would at most
<br>
have appeared on local news, and a plane crash would at most merit a
<br>
small national news mention unless it was particularly bad. Right now
<br>
the space program is so small, so concentrated both in terms of money,
<br>
technology and symbolism that any setback is amplified to a major
<br>
setback. 
<br>
<p>In a mature field there would be many other groups and systems that
<br>
would to some extent buffer an accident - if a plane goes down, it won't
<br>
freeze air traffic as a whole. But in a highly concentrated field -
<br>
human gene therapy, the concorde, the space program - accidents not just
<br>
mean the direct loss, but also a setback for the entire field. In order
<br>
to avoid risks to the other important parts of the project all activity
<br>
is closed down in order to investigate.
<br>
<p>But there is a further problem. The early railway crashes did not end
<br>
railways, it just led to the creation of safer railways. But the
<br>
Hindenburg crash spelled the end of the whole field of commercial
<br>
zeppelins. The difference was the spread of active support for the
<br>
technology, how many different projects/approaches there are and
<br>
especially if the general perception of the technology is that it is
<br>
needed. Railroads were generally supported and explored, while zeppelins 
<br>
were a fairly elite project not giving much benefit to most travellers 
<br>
(who still went by boat). 
<br>
<p>We need to get away from this risky, brittle elite project stage for 
<br>
many of our pet technologies, especially genetics and space. Setbacks 
<br>
happen, but they should be something to learn from rather the end of the 
<br>
endeavor.
