</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is the question I am asking.
</em><br>
<p>### For me the answer would be easy - I'll take the tax rebate, and use it
<br>
to upgrade my furnace. Next year I would still get the tax rebate, but the
<br>
heating bill would be no longer 200$ higher.
<br>
<p>Lowering taxes *and* reducing the not-contracted-for services of the state
<br>
increases my freedom and my ability to increase my standard of living,
<br>
except in the special cases of national defense, information provision, and
<br>
a few other minor uses.

</em><br>
<p>### Agreed. Would you be interested in reading my &quot;poorhouse&quot; proposal in
<br>
the archives, and tell me what you think?
