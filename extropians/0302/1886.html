</em><br>
<p>I kind of feel the same way.  You bring up a good point here.
<br>
<p>On the purely intellectual side, one can't get depressed over every last
<br>
death -- whatever the cause -- because simply too many people die each
<br>
minute and almost all of them die anonymously -- meaning they're
<br>
strangers to you and I and even to almost the rest of humanity, &quot;six
<br>
degrees of separation&quot; not withstanding.  (I also tend to think the &quot;six
<br>
degrees of separation&quot; thing is a metaphor that's been taken too far.
<br>
It's more like an average.  To someone living, say, in the Amazon jungle
<br>
who has little contact with the outside world, she or he is probably
<br>
fifty (pulling a number out of a hat) degrees of separation or more from
<br>
everyone else.)  Getting totally wrapped up in each death or even in
<br>
just the major tragedies of each day -- a train crash here, a building
<br>
fire there, a terrorist attack somewhere else -- would completely swamp
<br>
my mind with grief and I wouldn't be able to function.
<br>
<p>On the purely emotional side, any death is sad.  Hearing of the deaths
<br>
from the cold in Bangladesh recently made me very sad too.  From the
<br>
view of losing scientific-technological-intellectual-artistic &quot;the best
<br>
of the best,&quot; these Bangladeshi losses probably will not have an an
<br>
averse impact on future progress.  (Still, we don't and probably won't
<br>
ever completely understand just how such progress proceeds.  Who knows
<br>
what villager there might have raised the next Edison or Chandrasekhar
<br>
or van Gogh?)
<br>
<p>The point in life, too, is to be live and be happy -- not to be just a
<br>
cog in the wheel of a social machine, judged solely on one's fit in the
<br>
overall scheme of things.  The important thing, from a purely
<br>
existential perspective, is not that one produces more than the next
<br>
person or one contributes to the overall progress of civilization or
<br>
technology (or to the coming of this or that Singularity), but just that
<br>
one is alive and has a private life with its myriad of private choices
<br>
and experiences.  In fact, I would turn things around and judge a
<br>
society, even a civilization by the degree to which it allows and
<br>
encourages people to live their lives as they see fit in pursuit of
<br>
their happiness.  (Of course, with the qualification that people who are
<br>
purely destructive -- i.e., violent types --are kept in check.)
<br>
<p>Some paleoconservative thinkers, such as the _Chronicles_ crowd
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/">http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/</a> ), would argue that our attachments
<br>
are really all local.  We feel more those we know and, in the extreme,
<br>
our compassion and empathy is stronger for close friends and close
<br>
family than for the larger circles of humanity -- that we are embedded
<br>
in attachments that are much more compelling the more local they are and
<br>
less so the further away (socially/culturally) they are.  They would
<br>
argue, this is how it should be.  One should feel more strongly bound to
<br>
one's family than for one's neighborhood, and more strongly to one's
<br>
neighborhood than to one's country, more strongly to one's country to
<br>
one's continent or to the sum of humanity.  They would argue, too, that
<br>
overturning this actually creates more problems than it solves.
<br>
<p>Hayek has some similar themes in his _The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of
<br>
Socialism_.  One of his points about socialism's failure is that it
<br>
attempts to substitute a sort of close familiar based social logic and
<br>
feeling for the whole of society.  The latter, for him, works better if
<br>
the anonymous, spontaneously rule-based order of the market is giving
<br>
wider lattitude.  (See also &quot;Accounting for Changes in the Family:
<br>
Toward a Market Process Approach&quot; by Stephen Horwitz and Peter Lewin
