I think Mike may have said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To answer your question, the French use breeder reactors to cleanly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dispose of their nuclear waste. We tried to build one here in the US,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the anti-nukers got it canned because if the nuclear waste problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was solved, they'd have to get real jobs.
</em><br>
<p>I think much of this statment may be inaccurate.
<br>
<p>My current records (I'll supply the spreadsheet for people who send
<br>
me offlist requests) suggest that the U.S. and Russian inventories
<br>
of Highly Enriched Uranium and Plutonium are respectively 645, 1050,
<br>
100 and 160 *TONS*.
<br>
<p>There *isn't* a problem of &quot;fuel&quot; resources.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, breeder reactors are designed to produce greater amounts
<br>
of fissionable material, *not* to dispose of nuclear waste.  I strongly
<br>
suspect that the breeder reactor programs in the U.S. got terminated
<br>
because the military concluded funding the production of more fuel when
<br>
it already had enough for 74000+ nuclear weapons seemed just a
<br>
*little* bit unnecessary.  (There are some technical details
<br>
with respect to turning fuel for nuclear weapons into fuel
<br>
for nuclear reactors but these are well understood technical
<br>
issues that can be resolved.)
<br>
<p>Living in the state of Washington, where the Hanford facility
<br>
and the waste on its premisese is a frequent source of news
<br>
I can express with reasonable certainty -- if a breeder reactor
<br>
could dispose of nuclear waste -- we would have one operating
<br>
in this state.
<br>
<p>The French have (largely) solved the problem of a standardized
<br>
reactor design, well trained people who can operate those
<br>
reactors and fuel for those reactors.
<br>
<p>The French have not solved (to my knowledge) the issues
<br>
of the decommissioning of those reactors or the safe
<br>
long term storage of the radioactive materials that
<br>
result from the operation of nuclear reactors.  This issue
<br>
is what has produced the intense Yucca Mountain debate
<br>
in the U.S.
<br>
<p>The production of non-radioactive isotopes from the radioactive
<br>
isotopes produced by nuclear activities is currently a research
<br>
activity by Los Alamos National Laboratory and in addition some
<br>
European labs (I believe).  I believe I have mentioned this on
<br>
this list before.  The technology anticipated for these activities
<br>
is accelerator technology (presumably to impact the radioactive
<br>
isotopes with neutrons or protons to transform them into non-radioactive
<br>
isotopes and is not &quot;breeder reactor&quot; technology.  (I suppose one
<br>
could loosely consider this breeder reactor technology but it is
<br>
very much separated from the historical breeder reactor technology
<br>
designed to produce greater quantities of fissionable materials.)
<br>
<p>Since I feel that I'm about to shift into &quot;rant&quot; mode
<br>
I'll terminate this message now.  A following message
<br>
may include some commentary related to this topic if
<br>
I get it past my self-censors.
<br>
<p>Robert
