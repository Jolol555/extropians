<em>&gt; It certainly

</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups of people)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply do have to fight or die when we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confronted by others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have decided to exercise their choice to regard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us as prey.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet there are apparently a small but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insignificant percentage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the population that say that they would oppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war in all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances. 
</em><br>
<p>I completely disagree.  I assert only that certain
<br>
questions phrased properly in a poll can cause people
<br>
to appear as if the oppose war in all circumstances.
<br>
<p>Ask this, how many of these people would both say that
<br>
they love/care deeply about their family and or
<br>
friends, and would not kill someone if that was the
<br>
only way to save all their lives.  I posit you won't
<br>
find a single athiest our there that supports this. 
<br>
(as atheists were what you were getting at).  And save
<br>
for those with clear mental disorders, I disbelieve
<br>
you'll find any theists that would support this
<br>
either.
<br>
<p>Now, as to how the information comes out as it is: 
<br>
It's very possible that there's people who'd say they
<br>
won't support any war in refferring to one fought by
<br>
the US.  Could be that they've weighed the US as the
<br>
greatest threat to their freedom, and would rather die
<br>
fighting an enemy themselves if needed than have the
<br>
US take care of it.  It does not equate to willingness
<br>
to be prey as they see themselves already as prey of
<br>
the government.  (I'm NOT supporting this view, just
<br>
pointing out it's possibility).
<br>
<p>Another possibility could be their alliance lies with
<br>
whatever 'enemy' it is the home country is going after
<br>
at the time.
<br>
<p>I've never read in a history book of an invaded
<br>
land...and I mean close enough proximity to see, where
<br>
people were holding a peace protest and not scrambling
<br>
for their lives.  Am I wrong?
