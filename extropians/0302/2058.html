<em>&gt;In the aftermath of the Columbia disaster, a question lingering amid the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sorrowful assessments of loss is whether anything could have been done to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rescue the seven astronauts had NASA determined that the orbiter was too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;damaged for a safe reentry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The short answer: No.
</em><br>
<p>On this particular mission, that *may* be correct (it all depends on
<br>
whether they could have made it to the ISS by jettisoning the spacelab).
<br>
<p>But a very reasonable emergency system COULD be put in place without losing
<br>
too much cargo capacity. It is very nearly criminal that NASA is keeping
<br>
the ISS up there, and yet has no contingency plans whatsoever to use it in
<br>
a Shuttle rescue. Here's how you do that:
<br>
<p>First...and I'm amazed this has to be said...take the frigging docking
<br>
adapter OFF the freaking Shuttle and put it ON the goddam station. It is
<br>
stupid and wasteful to pay money to launch the thing into orbit EVERY TIME
<br>
you want to dock with the station. Redesign the Shuttle's side hatch so the
<br>
adapter attaches there.
<br>
<p>Next, make it possible to resupply the Shuttle in orbit. This is already
<br>
done with the ISS, usually with Progress rockets. This would not only help
<br>
with emergencies, it would also make possible much longer Shuttle missions.
<br>
Of course, you put all the attachment machinery in the rocket so the
<br>
Shuttle doesn't have to schlep it each time (external fuel fittings already
<br>
exist on the Shuttle to attach to the external tank). Whenever you launch a
<br>
Shuttle mission, you make sure there's a Progress ready to launch within a
<br>
day or so.
<br>
<p>You always carry an emergency EVA suit onboard. This doesn't necessarily
<br>
have to be as good a suit as the usual EVA suit, you'd just want it good
<br>
enough for a short emergency EVA.
<br>
<p>You put sensors behind the critical heat tile areas, so you know if you
<br>
have a problem.
<br>
<p>You develop heat tile &quot;goo&quot; which can be spackled into the hole of a
<br>
missing critical tile. If you wanna get fancy (and a lot more expensive),
<br>
run goo pipes under the critical areas so you could fix the spot from
<br>
inside the Shuttle.
<br>
<p>At one time, NASA was experimenting with emergency re-entry bags,
<br>
collapsible fabric spheres that a couple of astronauts could fit into,
<br>
which could survive re-entry to Earth. Dunno whatever became of those, but
<br>
I'd bet modern materials make them a lot more feasible. If nothing else,
<br>
build emergency transfer bags that could be used to ferry people between
<br>
the ISS and Shuttle if spacesuits are not practical for some reason. Store
<br>
several of these on the ISS, and modify the Soyuz escape capsule so it
<br>
could be sent down to a stranded Shuttle. For that matter, give the ISS a
<br>
useful lifeboat that could be ferried up and down between Shuttle and ISS
<br>
many times.
<br>
<p>It is an absolute criminal waste that every Shuttle external tank is dumped
<br>
back into the ocean and lost. By spending just a bit more fuel, those could
<br>
be parked in orbit and used as storage facilities for emergency supplies. I
<br>
believe one NASA engineer even has detailed plans for making them
<br>
functional parts of the ISS.
<br>
<p>Yeah, all of this would cost money. A lot of chair-bound officials are
<br>
weeping their crocodile tears and saying &quot;space travel is inherently
<br>
dangerous,&quot; but with just a tad more cash, it could be made a LOT safer.
<br>
<p>And I've got a really good idea where we could get that cash. There's
<br>
another article in the Times today that describes the Pentagon's fast track
<br>
program (at a cost of some $1.25 BILLION) to make nuclear bombs more
<br>
usable...yes, I said MORE USABLE. There has already been talk about using
<br>
nukes when...um, ha ha, I mean IF we invade Iraq. They think &quot;nucyaler
<br>
devices&quot; would make dandy bunker busters. They're talking SERIOUSLY about
<br>
using first-strike nukes.
<br>
<p>OK, so let's follow this track of logic. Weapons of mass destruction are
<br>
bad. Really bad. They're evil. That's why Saddam has to go, because he has
<br>
WMD. Wellllll..the US has WMD too, what's the deal here, are WE evil? Why
<br>
of course not. OUR WMD exist only as deterrents. Nobody would dare nuke us,
<br>
because we would then nuke them. So we would NNNEEEVVVEERRRR use ours
<br>
first, you see...
