Kai observed:
<br>
&lt;&lt;And Saddam simply has no business with Israel. He isn't a fanatic muslim 
<br>
either, but has violently destroyed every political and religious 
<br>
opposition, especially the religious groups. That's why bin Ladin will 
<br>
most probably neither find shelter nor help in Iraq, and will probably 
<br>
not send Al-Quaida to help Saddam&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>He has played the &quot;muslim card&quot; quite well since 1992. The Islamists use him 
<br>
and he uses them. Its not a tight relationship, but a relationship of 
<br>
conveinience, as he gives them weaponry and a place to train, and the 
<br>
Islamists give him contacts and willing participants in which to hit at his 
<br>
external enemies with.  With the Shiites, this is of course, a non-started 
<br>
because of Iran. But with Sunni extremists, who are not too picky; Saddam is 
<br>
a benefactor. There is surely Al Qeida in northern Iraq, involved in the 
<br>
Kurdistan mixup (2 parties, one pro, one anti-Saddam).
