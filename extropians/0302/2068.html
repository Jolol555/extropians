<em>&gt;I do not understand this statement. Why do you participate in a discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forum if you are not willing, or capable, to defend your positions to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with whom you have discussion? There is nothing wrong with having &quot;a peace
</em><br>
<em>&gt;loving&quot; attitude, my experience on this site leads me to believe it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something shared by everyone on this forum.
</em><br>
<p>Are you sure? I suggest you think more about this last sentence.
<br>
<p>I don't bother discussing at any depth my political philosophy or my
<br>
criticism of the U.S. government here any more, even though I agree
<br>
with most of Hubert's and Kai's and Dan's and Anders' and Damien's
<br>
(etc.) words, because I attracted a cluster of aggressive posters who
<br>
stereotyped and misinterpretted what I wrote, and it was tiring and
<br>
unpleasant to have to defend even the smallest and simplest of
<br>
statements. I know of many others here in the last 1-2 years who have
<br>
left the political discussions for the same or similar reasons. I'm
<br>
very sorry Eugene unsubbed (I'm not a member here either, but look at
<br>
the Javien forum selectively), but I think I understand why he left.
