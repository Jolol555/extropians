<p>We never ratified the Kyoto Treaty, so we never belonged enough to
<br>
breach it. You can't breach a treaty you've never ratified.
<br>
<p>The ABM treaty was with the defunct Soviet Union, which no longer
<br>
exists. Furthermore, the ABM treaty has measures for the acceptable
<br>
means of ending participation in the treaty. If you follow the measures
<br>
(i.e.  6 months notice, etc) then under international law it isn't a
<br>
breach to do so. A breach is only a breach if a) more than one of the
<br>
signatory national governments are still in existence, and b) one
<br>
violates the treaty without lawfully withdrawing from it.
<br>
<p>For example, if Iraq announced in 1998 that it was withdrawing from the
<br>
1991 cease fire agreement that ended that phase of the Gulf War, then
<br>
that would be it's lawful choice under international law. It would then
<br>
be the UN's job to recognise that and the coalition members would be
<br>
obligated to restart hostilities against Iraq required under UN
<br>
resolutions passed in 1990.
<br>
<p>North Korea isn't violating any law by withdrawing from the Nuclear
<br>
Non-Proliferation Treaty, though I believe that that also has a 6 month
<br>
window, from the time of announcing the withdrawal to engaging in
<br>
violating activities, so the fact that it is withdrawing enriched
<br>
plutonium from the Yong Byong reactor just weeks after announcing their
<br>
withdrawal is in fact a treaty breach in form.
<br>
<p>The US withdrew from its treaty with the USSR in the ABM Treaty (first
<br>
by announcing that it no longer existed because the USSR no longer
<br>
existed), but it announced it's lawful withdrawal more than 6 months
<br>
prior to tests it wanted to make that might be construed to violate the
<br>
treaty.
<br>
<p>We acted within international law at all times and acted even as if the
<br>
USSR still existed in our behavior in regards to the treaty.
