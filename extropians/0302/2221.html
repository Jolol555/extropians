</em><br>
<p>### It isn't. DATATOP found a *delay* in reaching the levodopa-requiring
<br>
level of symptomatology, not a reduction in total risk. At the same time,
<br>
there was no delay in time to dyskinesias on levodopa, and no delay of
<br>
death. In other words, patients treated with selegiline had the same or
<br>
higher level of disability as patients on levodopa, levodopa became equally
<br>
ineffective at the same time, and they died at the same rate. The delay to
<br>
levodopa is strictly due to the symptomatic effect of selegiline
<br>
<p>As background: there was once a hypothesis that levodopa accelerates the
<br>
attrition of dopaminergic neurons, and that levodopa-sparing therapy would
<br>
delay the onset of dyskinesias which usually develop after about 5-7 years
<br>
on levodopa, and perhaps prolong survival. A nice hypothesis, but not true -
<br>
substituting dopa-agonists or selegiline for levodopa in initial treatment
<br>
does not delay the onset of dyskinesia. Since the substitutes tend to be
<br>
less potent than levodopa, patients have more disability while on them, then
<br>
they have to use levodopa anyway because of the progression of the disease
<br>
makes life on selegiline alone impossible, and then they develop dyskinesia
<br>
after a short period, at the same time as the cohort which was on levodopa
<br>
from the beginning. There is an isolated effect of deprenyl on gait
<br>
freezing, nothing more so far. The main difference is that they end up
<br>
paying for their treatment much more, since levodopa is cheap, but mirapex,
<br>
ropinirole, and selegiline are expensive.
<br>
<p>I note that the abstract you quote is quite old. There is a number of
<br>
excellent reviews of DATATOP with much more data, as well as the actual
<br>
primary publication (see below). It's useful to stay on top of your data.

<br>
<p>Annals of Neurology. 43(3):318-25, 1998 Mar.
<br>
<p>Abstract
<br>
Deprenyl (selegiline) delays the need for levodopa therapy in patients with
<br>
early Parkinson's disease, but the value of long-term treatment with this
<br>
type B monoamine oxidase inhibitor remains unsettled. We examined mortality
<br>
among the 800 patients with early Parkinson's disease who were not requiring
<br>
levodopa and who were randomly assigned in the DATATOP trial to receive
<br>
deprenyl, tocopherol, combined treatments, or placebo. Ascertainment of the
<br>
vital status of subjects in this double-blinded trial was performed
<br>
prospectively after the initial randomization, during open-label deprenyl,
<br>
and after a second independent randomization to continue active deprenyl or
<br>
switch to matching placebo. The study was conducted at 28 academic medical
<br>
centers in the United States and Canada. After an average of 8.2 years of
<br>
observation, the overall death rate of our subjects was 17.1% (137 of 800)
<br>
or 2.1% per year. The mortality rate was unaffected by deprenyl, tocopherol,
<br>
or combined treatment assignments and was about that expected for an age-
<br>
and gender-matched US population without Parkinson's disease. Neither
<br>
deprenyl, tocopherol, nor their combined treatments affected the duration of
<br>
life in our early Parkinson's disease patients. The deprenyl-related delay
<br>
in disability that we reported previously was not associated with a
<br>
deprenyl-related reduction in mortality.

<br>
<p>Abstract
<br>
OBJECTIVE: To study the development of freezing of gait in PD. BACKGROUND:
<br>
Freezing of gait is a common, disabling, and poorly understood symptom in
<br>
PD. METHODS: The authors analyzed data from 800 patients with early PD from
<br>
the Deprenyl and Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism (DATATOP)
<br>
clinical trial who were assigned either placebo, deprenyl, tocopherol, or
<br>
the combination of deprenyl and tocopherol. The primary outcome measure was
<br>
the time from randomization until the freezing of gait score on the Unified
<br>
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) became positive. RESULTS:
<br>
Fifty-seven patients (7.1%) had freezing of gait at study entry and 193
<br>
(26%) of the remaining patients experienced the symptom by the end of the
<br>
follow-up period. Those with freezing of gait at baseline had significantly
<br>
more advanced disease than those without the symptom, as measured by total
<br>
UPDRS and Hoehn and Yahr stage. High baseline risk factors for developing
<br>
freezing of gait during the follow-up period were the onset of PD with a
<br>
gait disorder; higher scores of rigidity, postural instability, bradykinesia
<br>
and speech; and longer disease duration. In contrast, tremor was strongly
<br>
associated with a decreased risk for freezing of gait. At the end of
<br>
follow-up, the signs most strongly associated with the freezing phenomenon
<br>
were gait, balance, and speech disorders, not rigidity or bradykinesia.
<br>
Deprenyl treatment was strongly associated with a decreased risk for
<br>
developing freezing of gait; tocopherol had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: Freezing
<br>
of gait is directly related to duration of PD. Risk factors at onset of
<br>
disease are the absence of tremor and PD beginning as a gait disorder. The
<br>
development of freezing of gait in the course of the illness is strongly
<br>
associated with the development of balance and speech problems, less so with
<br>
the worsening of bradykinesia, and is not associated with the progression of
<br>
rigidity. These results support the concept that the freezing phenomenon is
<br>
distinct from bradykinesia. Deprenyl, in the absence of L-dopa, was found to
<br>
be an effective prophylactic treatment and should be considered for patients
<br>
with PD who have an onset of gait difficulty.

<br>
<p>Abstract
<br>
In 1987, the DATATOP clinical trial was initiated to examine the benefits of
<br>
deprenyl (selegiline) and alpha-tocopherol in slowing the progression of
<br>
Parkinson's disease (PD). After 14 +/- 6 (mean +/- SD) months of controlled
<br>
observation, deprenyl 10 mg/day was found to significantly delay the time
<br>
until enough disability developed to warrant the initiation of levodopa
<br>
therapy. This effect was largely sustained during the overall 8.2 years of
<br>
observation, including open-label deprenyl treatment and a second treatment
<br>
randomization to continue deprenyl or switch to placebo. There were no
<br>
accompanying benefits of deprenyl in postponing levodopa-related adverse
<br>
effects or extending life. Alpha-tocopherol produced no benefits. The 2.1%
<br>
per year mortality rate of the DATATOP cohort was remarkably low, about the
<br>
same as an age-matched population without PD. Neuroprotective therapy
<br>
remains an elusive goal for the experimental therapeutics of PD. Advances in
<br>
understanding pathogenesis, a robust pipeline of rational treatments, and
<br>
the advent of valid and reliable biologic markers hold promise in the coming
<br>
decade for developing and achieving neuroprotective therapies for PD.
