<em>&gt;Subject: Re: shuttle breaks up on re-entry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I watched one of the NASA controllers say something today that is typical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of holding on to old technology too long. He said that they did not bother
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to check for tile damage in orbit because there is nothing they can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about it if there is any damage. This was true 20 years ago when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;designed the shuttle program, but now we have a space station, and vastly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advanced computer and robotic technology. True, no one would be happy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about a shuttle stuck at the station while the procedures to fix it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;space were developed (perhaps as long as a year or two), but it still beats
</em><br>
<em>&gt;total loss of the orbiter and the lives of the crew.
</em><br>
<p>I've been thinking something like that as a task for ISS.  Visual data from 
<br>
multiple angles is analyzed after take off.  If any problems are 
<br>
identified, these are communicated to the crew.  The decision is made as to 
<br>
whether the suspected problem is serious or not.  If it's deemed to be, 
<br>
they rendevous with ISS for inspection and repairs.  Not sure whether this 
<br>
would make much difference, but in this situation it may have, given what's 
<br>
been determined thus far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Old technology needs to be thrown out from time to time because it always
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has the assumptions of the past frozen into its very fabric. Today we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could design small robots who have the job of going out and inspecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;space craft while in orbit, and fixing a class of problems that could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have been fixed 20 years ago. Today there is no good reason to send the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;payload and crew in the same ship. Computers can fly the current (old)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;design just fine without the human crew, and a new smaller and safer space
</em><br>
<em>&gt;craft could be designed to carry the humans for linkup in orbit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Many other possibilities exist; it is time for new thinking.
</em><br>

<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
