</em><br>
<p>Welcome to the field of media studies. As far as I understand it, much 
<br>
of the entire academic field is based on the above, with heavy theories 
<br>
about how it happens, who is behind it and why they are. The analysis 
<br>
ranges from cheap conspiracy theories to quite elegant combinations of 
<br>
memetics, economics and social psychology, with an IMHO center of mass 
<br>
on the conspiracyish side. 
<br>
<p>When I read my first media study Ph.D. thesis I was shocked - how could
<br>
the author have gained a Ph.D. from *that*?! Then I slowly came to
<br>
realise that by the standards of its subject (at least in Sweden) it was
<br>
a typical thesis, and even had a few good points in the midst of what my
<br>
natural sciences reading first took as garbage. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I acquired this notion decades ago during the Viet Nam thing when what I was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing first hand in South East Asia didn't match what I was seeing second 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand on the tube......
</em><br>
<p>It happens all the time everywhere, and has done so since mass media 
<br>
began. The fun is to figure out the different biases and how to get 
<br>
around them.
<br>
<p>The real issue should be what forms of bias are really necessary to 
<br>
remove through laws, other forms of coercion or the setup of alternative 
<br>
institutions, and efficient ways of getting less biased information from 
<br>
biased sources. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; HOWEVER.........war protestors?   I hear lots and lots of war 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protestors.....a whole hour was devoted to an &quot;interview&quot; for example....
</em><br>
<p>Does the Clinton protestors fit into the narrative of the TV news? They
<br>
have a narrative of how war protestors work, a kind of ready-made story,
<br>
with a tone, images and message that reporters, producers and even
<br>
protestors tend to conform to. There is also the presidential protest
<br>
narrative, but it is different. These two narratives cannot be combined; 
<br>
the result would feel strange to the reporters and producers, and the 
<br>
story would not be sent since it seemed to be less good than the other 
<br>
stories of the day. 
<br>
<p>The same is true for other issues. Transhumanism can currently be shown
<br>
in the &quot;excentric people and inventions&quot; narrative, the &quot;wonders of
<br>
science&quot; narrative and the frankenscience narrative&quot;. The first one
<br>
trivializes us and our ideas - look how cute they are, believing in
<br>
crazy stuff like cloning and nanotech! The second deals with a gadget or
<br>
idea, reporting about its discovery, nifty features and glorious future 
<br>
(for fairness a naysayer is always included). The third shows how we are 
<br>
making a faustian pact with technology that will cost us (and everybody 
<br>
else) our souls. 
<br>
<p>We need to get out of these narratives and create our own narratives. 
<br>
Even ending up in the &quot;two sides debates a boring issue&quot; narrative would 
<br>
be great.
