&lt;&lt; U.S. Diplomat's Letter of Resignation
<br>
<p>The following is the text of John Brady Kiesling's letter of resignation 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Mr. Kiesling is a career 
<br>
diplomat who has served in United States embassies from Tel Aviv to 
<br>
Casablanca to Yerevan.
<br>
<p>Dear Mr. Secretary:
<br>
<p>I am writing you to submit my resignation from the Foreign Service of 
<br>
the United States and from my position as Political Counselor in U.S. 
<br>
Embassy Athens, effective March 7. I do so with a heavy heart. The 
<br>
baggage of my upbringing included a felt obligation to give something 
<br>
back to my country. Service as a U.S. diplomat was a dream job. I was 
<br>
paid to understand foreign languages and cultures, to seek out 
<br>
diplomats, politicians, scholars and journalists, and to persuade them 
<br>
that U.S. interests and theirs fundamentally coincided. My faith in my 
<br>
country and its values was the most powerful weapon in my diplomatic 
<br>
arsenal.
<br>
<p>It is inevitable that during twenty years with the State Department I 
<br>
would become more sophisticated and cynical about the narrow and selfish 
<br>
bureaucratic motives that sometimes shaped our policies. Human nature is 
<br>
what it is, and I was rewarded and promoted for understanding human 
<br>
nature. But until this Administration it had been possible to believe 
<br>
that by upholding the policies of my president I was also upholding the 
<br>
interests of the American people and the world. I believe it no longer.
<br>
<p>The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible not only with 
<br>
American values but also with American interests. Our fervent pursuit of 
<br>
war with Iraq is driving us to squander the international legitimacy 
<br>
that has been America’s most potent weapon of both offense and defense 
<br>
since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle the largest 
<br>
and most effective web of international relationships the world has ever 
<br>
known. Our current course will bring instability and danger, not security.
<br>
<p>The sacrifice of global interests to domestic politics and to 
<br>
bureaucratic self- interest is nothing new, and it is certainly not a 
<br>
uniquely American problem. Still, we have not seen such systematic 
<br>
distortion of intelligence, such systematic manipulation of American 
<br>
opinion, since the war in Vietnam. The September 11 tragedy left us 
<br>
stronger than before, rallying around us a vast international coalition 
<br>
to cooperate for the first time in a systematic way against the threat 
<br>
of terrorism. But rather than take credit for those successes and build 
<br>
on them, this Administration has chosen to make terrorism a domestic 
<br>
political tool, enlisting a scattered and largely defeated Al Qaeda as 
<br>
its bureaucratic ally. We spread disproportionate terror and confusion 
<br>
in the public mind, arbitrarily linking the unrelated problems of 
<br>
terrorism and Iraq. The result, and perhaps the motive, is to justify a 
<br>
vast misallocation of shrinking public wealth to the military and to 
<br>
weaken the safeguards that protect American citizens from the heavy hand 
<br>
of government. September 11 did not do as much damage to the fabric of 
<br>
American society as we seem determined to so to ourselves. Is the Russia 
<br>
of the late Romanovs really our model, a selfish, superstitious empire 
<br>
thrashing toward self-destruction in the name of a doomed status quo?
<br>
<p>We should ask ourselves why we have failed to persuade more of the world 
<br>
that a war with Iraq is necessary. We have over the past two years done 
<br>
too much to assert to our world partners that narrow and mercenary U.S. 
<br>
interests override the cherished values of our partners. Even where our 
<br>
aims were not in question, our consistency is at issue. The model of 
<br>
Afghanistan is little comfort to allies wondering on what basis we plan 
<br>
to rebuild the Middle East, and in whose image and interests. Have we 
<br>
indeed become blind, as Russia is blind in Chechnya, as Israel is blind 
<br>
in the Occupied Territories, to our own advice, that overwhelming 
<br>
military power is not the answer to terrorism? After the shambles of 
<br>
post-war Iraq joins the shambles in Grozny and Ramallah, it will be a 
<br>
brave foreigner who forms ranks with Micronesia to follow where we lead.
<br>
<p>We have a coalition still, a good one. The loyalty of many of our 
<br>
friends is impressive, a tribute to American moral capital built up over 
<br>
a century. But our closest allies are persuaded less that war is 
<br>
justified than that it would be perilous to allow the U.S. to drift into 
<br>
complete solipsism. Loyalty should be reciprocal. Why does our President 
<br>
condone the swaggering and contemptuous approach to our friends and 
<br>
allies this Administration is fostering, including among its most senior 
<br>
officials. Has “oderint dum metuant” really become our motto?
<br>
<p>I urge you to listen to America’s friends around the world. Even here in 
<br>
Greece, purported hotbed of European anti-Americanism, we have more and 
<br>
closer friends than the American newspaper reader can possibly imagine. 
<br>
Even when they complain about American arrogance, Greeks know that the 
<br>
world is a difficult and dangerous place, and they want a strong 
<br>
international system, with the U.S. and EU in close partnership. When 
<br>
our friends are afraid of us rather than for us, it is time to worry. 
<br>
And now they are afraid. Who will tell them convincingly that the United 
<br>
States is as it was, a beacon of liberty, security, and justice for the 
<br>
planet?
<br>
<p>Mr. Secretary, I have enormous respect for your character and ability. 
<br>
You have preserved more international credibility for us than our policy 
<br>
deserves, and salvaged something positive from the excesses of an 
<br>
ideological and self- serving Administration. But your loyalty to the 
<br>
President goes too far. We are straining beyond its limits an 
<br>
international system we built with such toil and treasure, a web of 
<br>
laws, treaties, organizations, and shared values that sets limits on our 
<br>
foes far more effectively than it ever constrained America’s ability to 
<br>
defend its interests.
<br>
<p>I am resigning because I have tried and failed to reconcile my 
<br>
conscience with my ability to represent the current U.S. Administration. 
<br>
I have confidence that our democratic process is ultimately 
<br>
self-correcting, and hope that in a small way I can contribute from 
<br>
outside to shaping policies that better serve the security and 
<br>
prosperity of the American people and the world we share. &gt;&gt;

<br>
<p>fyi,
<br>
