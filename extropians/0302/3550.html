</em><br>
<p><p>I don't think it is a miscalculation like that. There will probably be 
<br>
no consequences for/inside France because of it. Inside the EU there is 
<br>
a mild shaking if heads. Which is probably all the reactions it is going 
<br>
to get. We in Denmark also go critized, but we don't take the critique 
<br>
that serious. There has been this kind of &quot;family&quot; trouble before, and 
<br>
they get worked out.
<br>
<p>The main problem is the attitude towards new members. We have a great 
<br>
opertunity to create a huge zone of peacefull cooperation, and that 
<br>
should not be destroyed by some &quot;minor&quot; disagreement. A critique like 
<br>
that is likely to alienate those potential new members.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt;&gt;Which is plain stupid just before they are going to vote
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;on joining the EU.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Sorry, I'm a bit behind on this.  I thought that a number of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; smaller countries, in Eastern Europe primarily, were later on
</em><br>
<em> &gt; going to be trying to join the EU, and so France was telling
</em><br>
<em> &gt; them they'd be sorry for this attitude they have.  In your
</em><br>
<em> &gt; sentence here, who is voting for what?  Do you mean to say
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that countries like Denmark are *more likely* to try to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; punish France by making it *easier* for those Eastern
</em><br>
<em> &gt; European countries to join instead of harder?
</em><br>
<p><p>They are (most likely) going to join the EU. The financing and terms has 
<br>
been agreed on at the last summit. So the deal is done with the EU.
<br>
<p>But those countries still has have a vote as to whether they should join 
<br>
the EU. Most likely joining will mean some transfer of power from the 
<br>
national state, that should be approved according to their individual 
<br>
constituions, via a national vote. (cannot remember the english term.)
<br>
<p>So pissing of the population in those potential memberstates is foolish, 
<br>
if you want them to vote for joining the EU. But then again, France have 
<br>
never been that eager to make the new eastern european countries join 
<br>
the EU.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt;&gt;Chirac is arrogant and no better than Bush.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt; Okay, you're from Denmark, Max.  And it's not surprising that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; this strikes Danish people as arrogant.  Are we to suppose
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that people in France do not find this behavior questionable?
</em><br>
<em> &gt; What about Germany.  Surely you know something about how
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Germans are looking at this, or not?
