This is slightly wrong.  A more accurate statement would be &quot;The models 
<br>
used in game theory are often extreme oversimplifications...&quot;.  True, 
<br>
they MUST be, because otherwise the math becomes computationally 
<br>
intractable, but it's the model, and not the theory that are 
<br>
oversimplifications.  The theory quickly becomes complex beyond belief.
<br>
<p>OTOH, if you mean zero-sum two person game theory, then yes, it is 
<br>
often, even usually, an oversimplification.  And that's the one that 
<br>
gets used most often, because it's the easiest to figure out.  (Not 
<br>
because it's the most appropriate.)
<br>
<p>Yet again, in a way this is like saying that physics is an 
<br>
oversimplified model of the world... well, theoretically if you were to 
<br>
model each particle (with appropriate degrees of uncertainty), and then 
<br>
calculate forward the reactions... you would get the answer that 
<br>
actually occurs.  But it's a computationaly intractable approach, so 
<br>
nobody does it (well... you also don't really have the initial 
<br>
conditions).  Note that you wouldn't get one answer, you would get a 
<br>
sheave of answers.  This is the same result that a full application of 
<br>
game theory to a real situation would give.  Granted, in the game theory 
<br>
approach you might know the full relevant initial conditions, the answer 
<br>
would still be a statistical distribution (except in certain very simple 
<br>
cases).
