We just had 100,000 people protesting in Adelaide yesterday (what a stunning
<br>
event, really overwhelming I must tell you). Meanwhile, Sydney had 300,000
<br>
people (yes, Melbourne's record is beaten already, a very Sydney-Melbourne
<br>
thing), and Brisbane had 100,000. This is a LOT of people, given we are a
<br>
country of only 19 million.
<br>
<p>Also, I saw reports of 2 MILLION people gathering in London. Yow!

This talk about the moral imperative to remove dictators brings up something
that's been nagging at me about the holier-than-thou democracies proposing
to go around kicking out other people's governments. There is a moral
superiority granted to these governments (by themselves), deriving from
their democratic basis. However, when you attack another country, you are
not a democratic government with respect to the target population; you are
an hostile power attempting to impose your will. When you pressure other
governments, jackbootwise, into doing your bidding, you are again an hostile
power imposing your will by force. When you make it clear to the world that
you are comfortable with such behaviour, and in fact intend to continue in
it and increase it, you are to the population of the world at large, who
have no say in your election, a dictatorship. This is a dictatorship that is
at best benign and at worst tyranous and somewhat murderous, even though to
your own people you are a free democracy.
&lt;/flamebait&gt;

&gt; [demonstration? here they were singing 
&gt; wide and loud this strophe]

&gt; When you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's plains, 
&gt; And the women come out to cut up what remains, 
&gt; Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains 
&gt; An' go to your Gawd like a soldier. 
&gt; Go, go, go like a soldier, 
&gt; Go, go, go like a soldier, 
&gt; Go, go, go like a soldier, 
&gt; So-oldier of the Queen!
