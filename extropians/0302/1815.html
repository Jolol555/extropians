<p>
I recently considered the question of proving that Bayesian observations 
<br>
never actually *decrease* your knowledge.  To do this, I first had to 
<br>
define &quot;knowledge&quot;.  Let's say your prior knowledge is that the 
<br>
probability of case A is p, and hence that the probability of case ~A is 
<br>
(1 - p).  In this case, in p cases you would score p points and in (1 - p) 
<br>
cases you would score (1 - p) points.  For example, say that in a sample 
<br>
group of 100 patients, 20% have HIV - this is your prior knowledge and 
<br>
it's all the prior knowledge you have.  So for any given patient, your 
<br>
sole knowledge about them is that they have a 20% chance of being infected 
<br>
with HIV.  For 20 patients, or 20% of the group, the truth is that they 
<br>
have HIV; you score the 20% probability you assigned to this outcome.  For 
<br>
80% of the group, the truth is that they don't have HIV; you score the 80% 
<br>
probability you assigned to that outcome.  And your total knowledge is 
<br>
.2*.2 + .8*.8 = .68.
<br>
<p>The question I was considering was what a Bayesian observation does to 
<br>
&quot;knowledge&quot; as thus defined, and whether it's possible to prove that a 
<br>
Bayesian observation can never decrease your knowledge.
<br>
<p>Given Bayes' Theorem, with prior probability p, and conditional 
<br>
probabilities m and n:
<br>
<p>The prior knowledge is p^2 + (1 - p)^2
<br>
The posterior knowledge after making the observation is:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[(pm)^2 + ((1-p)n)^2]/[pm + (1 - p)n] +
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[(p(1 - m))^2 + ((1 - p)(1 - n))^2]/[p(1 - m) + (1 - p)(1 - n)]
<br>
<p>And the increase in knowledge is:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2[p(1 - p)(m - n)]^2/[pm + (1 - p)n][p(1 - m) + (1 - p)(1 - n)]
<br>
<p>I worked out this result last night and would like to know what 
<br>
probability theorists call it, and what term they use for &quot;knowledge&quot;. 
<br>
The equation for change in knowledge is very beautiful, since it behaves 
<br>
exactly as expected, and I'm posting it here in the hopes that someone 
<br>
recognizes it immediately.
<br>
<p>In other words, I'm looking for someone trained in probability math who 
<br>
can look at this and say, &quot;Oh, that's just &lt;Google keyword&gt;.&quot;
<br>
