<p>I assume an altruist-Platonist is supposed to try to maximize his global
<br>
utility. What role is the local utility supposed to play? BTW, the only
<br>
difference between your &quot;global&quot; utility and my utility is that I
<br>
subtracted out the parts of the multiverse that can't be causally affected
<br>
by the decision maker, so they're really equivalent. But for the argument
<br>
below I'll use your definition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If he sees X=0

</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected global utility is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(.99)*u(.99m observers see 0 =&gt; .99m observers choose 0 =&gt; .99m observers 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; observers are punished)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; +
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(.01)*u(.99m observers see 1 =&gt; .99m observers choose 1 =&gt; .99m observers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are rewarded &amp;&amp; .01m observers see 0 =&gt; .01m observers choose 0 =&gt; .01m 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observers are punished)
</em><br>
<p>Remember in my last post I wrote:
<br>
<p>Note that if he did apply Bayes's rule, then his expected utility would
<br>
instead become .99*U(.99m people rewarded) + .01*U(.01m people punished)
<br>
which would weight the reward too heavily. It doesn't matter in this case
<br>
but would matter in other situations.
<br>
<p>You're basically making exactly this mistake, and I'll describe one of the
<br>
&quot;other situations&quot; where it's easy to see that it is a mistake.  Suppose
<br>
in the thought experiment, the reward for guessing 1 if X=1 is 1000 times
<br>
as high as the reward for guessing 0 if X=0 (and the punishments stay the
<br>
same). Wouldn't you agree that in this case, you should guess 1 even if
<br>
the printout says 0? The way you compute global utility, however, your
<br>
utility is still higher if you guess 0 when you see 0.
<br>
<p>Here're the calculations. Let R stand for &quot;observers rewarded&quot;, E stand
<br>
for &quot;observers rewarded extra&quot;, i.e. rewarded 1000 times more, and P for
<br>
&quot;observers punished&quot;. And let u(E) = 1000*u(R) = -1000*u(P) = 1000.  
<br>
According to your utility function, the expected utilities of choosing 0
<br>
or 1 are:
<br>
<p>EU(choose 0)
<br>
.99*u(.99m R &amp; .01m P) + .01*u(.99m E &amp; .01m P)
<br>
=
<br>
.99*.98 + .01*(990-.01)
<br>
=
<br>
10.8701
<br>
<p>EU(choose 1)
<br>
.99*u(1m P) + .01u(1m E)
<br>
=
<br>
-.99+10
<br>
=
<br>
9.01
<br>
<p>If you do the same computations without applying Bayes's rule first,
<br>
you'll see that EU(choose 1) &gt; EU(choose 0), but I won't go through the
<br>
details. What's going on here is that by applying Bayes's rule, you're
<br>
discounting the extra reward twice, once through the probability, and
<br>
another time through the measure of observers, so the extra reward is
<br>
discounted by a factor of 10000 instead of 100. That's why I choose to
<br>
make the extra reward worth 1000 times the normal reward.
