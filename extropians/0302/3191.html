From: Lee Corbin [mailto:<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=RE:%20Not%20about%20IRAQ%20at%20all,%20was%20Re:%20Bush%20budget%20has%200%20dollars%20for%20Afghanistan">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; Are you implying that poor people, who indeed are more prone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this jealousy or irrational urge for revenge, become less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; envious or irrational if you give them money?  Quite the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrary---unconsciously, at least, it's a slap in the face. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All people's self-image is crucial.  Relevantly here, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most important thing is to remove obvious oppressors, but beyond
</em><br>
that?
<br>
<p>What I'm saying is that poor people with decent jobs and an optimistic
<br>
outlook on their economic future are less motivated to throw that away
<br>
through violence or crime than poor people without hope.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A fine list, worthy of dissection.  On each item, one must 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask &quot;Why didn't the World Bank or the IMF try this?  Or... did
</em><br>
they?&quot;
<br>
<p>The IMF forces countries who receive loans from it to engage in
<br>
certain market reforms and monetary reforms.  It has been accused of
<br>
pursuing a &quot;one size fits all&quot; plan that doesn't adapt the pace or
<br>
order of the reforms to the individual economy, but I don't know
<br>
enough about this argument to say much.
<br>
<p>I do know that the reforms the IMF seeks are economic ones, not
<br>
political ones.  It doesn't demand free elections, a free press, the
<br>
rule of law, or respect for civil liberties.  Perhaps it should.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Right now, it may be the wisest course 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the U.S. to *appear* to be doing little for the Karzai 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government. That way, the Afghanis could begin to develop the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills necessary to manage by themselves---and weave towards
</em><br>
progress.
<br>
<p>I can see why you think this, but I disagree.  I think the risk of
<br>
being perceived as an occupying power is worth it to really establish
<br>
democracy and affluence in a country.  I think the negative
<br>
repercussions of occupation start to fall away within just a few years
<br>
if its done right.  People can tolerate a foreign presence when it
<br>
comes with a rapidly rising standard of living.  We just have to
<br>
remember to get out at the right time as well.
