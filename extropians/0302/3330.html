<em>&gt; I am curious about this.  How can you compel the US to obey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your will?  What about breaking diplomatic relations, economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warfare of some sort?
</em><br>
<p><p>It is you pro-war because we can think of anything better folks 
<br>
who are into forcing obedience.  We will simply keep pointing 
<br>
out just how unjustifiable and wrong these choices are.  We will 
<br>
also find what means we can, peaceful for those who actually 
<br>
believe in peace but not necessarily ineffective for all that, 
<br>
to oppose this action.
<br>

<em>&gt; Hal posted about &quot;stealth democracy&quot; and the researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he quoted had me pegged pretty well: I wouldn't make (myself)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a great study of policy issues confronting my country, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather trust people whose ideology is close to mine, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are presumably paid professionals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am sure many people in many aggressor nations and budding 
<br>
fascist states said the same thing at some critical points in 
<br>
history.  How is this different from leaving the moral questions 
<br>
in the hands of those paid to consider them?  What does that 
<br>
make you?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But my *attitude* towards, say, France or Germany invading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bosnia would have been &quot;What affair is it of my country?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's in Europe.&quot;  To be honest, I felt the same way about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russia and Chechnya.  So one other item to put on the table
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, &quot;Perhaps other nations should mind their own business.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What happens in Iraq doesn't *directly* concern them.*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now I must quickly say that of course, talk is cheap and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone (including other countries, of course) is quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entitled to their opinion.  But from the way some sound,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's as if they regard the upcoming invasion as taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place on their own soil!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So, it is none of their business if we invade some other country 
<br>
but it is our business to invade some other country that isn't 
<br>
our business?  No, wait.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for &quot;today, yes, it's Iraq, but tomorrow it may be Iceland&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is so silly it hardly deserves comment.  I can just see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ten years of pressure from dozens and dozens of countries,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innumerable U.N. resolutions, thousands of flights over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iceland to figure out just what those scoundrels are up to,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc., etc.  ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Were you napping when Bush declared it as US doctrine that we 
<br>
can preemptively strike anywhere on Earth we feel threatened? 
<br>
Assuming those paid to think about such things are actually 
<br>
capable of meaning what they say, I think it is not too silly to 
<br>
worry about such things.
