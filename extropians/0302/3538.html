<p><em>&gt; [Christian wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The way this mess should have played out instead is that the EU
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sits down, after much painful negotiation comes to a common position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and declaration [concerning whether or not to support the U.S./U.K.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aggressive stance], and of course it is expected that the countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; poised to join the Union share the common values and policy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agree with this (or diplomatically shut up).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Well actually the EU had done that!  Then Germany and France held a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private meeting, where they made up their own minds, and their own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The other countries then made a reply to that, with the open letter, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that just stated the EU's original position.  France Chirac then makes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this stupid reply.
</em><br>
<p>This reply was not stupid in the eyes of Christian, who I believe
<br>
lives in Germany (although OF COURSE he does not and cannot speak
<br>
for all Germans).  My question, basically, originally, was does
<br>
or does not the statement by Chirac seem high-handed or arrogant
<br>
to people living inside France?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So actually Germany and France are acting over the heads of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of the EU.  Which isn't exactly a nice thing to do, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are getting angry when we don't just keep quiet about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When Chirac then makes a statement that the new countries should act 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more humble, he is making it all to clear to them that they are second 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate citizens in Europe.
</em><br>
<p>A miscalculation?  Are you saying that the leader of France
<br>
made a (perhaps hasty) miscalculation?  Yes, I do concede 
<br>
that this happens from time to time; on the other hand, in
<br>
this particular case he's throwing France's weight around;
<br>
sometimes countries just do this, e.g., the U.S. is right
<br>
now throwing its weight around with regard to countries
<br>
like Iraq and North Korea, telling them what weapons they
<br>
may or may not possess.
<br>
<p>But it is a miscalculation only if either (a) other EU
<br>
countries are sufficiently annoyed by this, or (b) even
<br>
the people within France find it unacceptable.  Of course,
<br>
if (b), then doubtless (a).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which is plain stupid just before they are going to vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on joining the EU.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I'm a bit behind on this.  I thought that a number of
<br>
smaller countries, in Eastern Europe primarily, were later on
<br>
going to be trying to join the EU, and so France was telling
<br>
them they'd be sorry for this attitude they have.  In your
<br>
sentence here, who is voting for what?  Do you mean to say
<br>
that countries like Denmark are *more likely* to try to 
<br>
punish France by making it *easier* for those Eastern
<br>
European countries to join instead of harder?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Chirac is arrogant and no better than Bush.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, you're from Denmark, Max.  And it's not surprising that
<br>
this strikes Danish people as arrogant.  Are we to suppose 
<br>
that people in France do not find this behavior questionable?
<br>
What about Germany.  Surely you know something about how
<br>
Germans are looking at this, or not?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
