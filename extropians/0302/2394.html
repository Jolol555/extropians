<p><em>&gt; Its structure that matters, not mass...To look on mass

</em><br>
<p>Yes, quite.  To anyone who supposes that it's mass alone,
<br>
just think for a moment which is more dangerous for the
<br>
occupants: a collision between two SUVs or between two
<br>
motorcycles.

<p>Bill refers to
<br>
<p><em>&gt; an article published in the SF Examiner 9th Dec 2002 by Leonard Evans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entitled 'We need higher taxes on gas' which eloquently sets out the case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Although there is no consensus on whether making vehicles more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuel-economic increases or decreases the total amount of fuel the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation uses, there is universal agreement among economists that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing the cost of a commodity reduces its consumption.'
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but the reason that an economic commodity is utilized
<br>
by freely participating individuals and firms in an economy
<br>
in the first place is precisely because it generates wealth.
<br>
*All* efforts to distort natural wealth-producing exchanges
<br>
decrease productivity and wealth creation.

<p><em>&gt; ### Ah, exactly, *somebody* must save my life against my will. I must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deprived of the ability to move around, so I won't get hurt on the way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a different two-point plan:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Rounding-up busybodies in camps where they can interfere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    only with each other... to reduce unwanted interference
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    and power of busybodies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) The freedom to propose restrictions on freedom must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    restricted in order to save freedom.
</em><br>
<p>Though a bit overstated (knowingly, for effect), I agree completely.
<br>
And from both an economic perspective, and from a perspective that
<br>
places as much value as is feasible on individual liberty.
<br>
<p>By *taxing* an activity, however well intentioned, you invariably
<br>
weaken and damage an economy.
