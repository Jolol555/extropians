Thanks Jacob.  The explanation you shared makes complete sense to me, but I
<br>
don't *feel* it.  That's why I said I don't &quot;grok&quot; it fully.
<br>
<p>I found it very interesting how many times the concept of &quot;self&quot; was
<br>
mentioned in the explanation. At the risk of sounding &quot;wishy washy&quot;, and
<br>
paradoxically at odds with the libertarian (Randian) aspects of extropian
<br>
thinking, I find the concept of &quot;self&quot; to be a pervasive illusion that leads
<br>
to a great deal of suffering in the world.
<br>
<p>I think we would do well to examine our evolutionary-based concept of self
<br>
and *consciously* ;-) decide to improve on it.
<br>

<p><p>Jef,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also realize I don't fully grok the concept. For example, I have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perplexed for years trying to understand how so many people adopt an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrary choice of sports team and behave as if &quot;their&quot; team winning is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearly a life and death matter.
</em><br>
<p>I read an explanation in a book, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by
<br>
Robert Cialdini, that I found interesting.
<br>
&quot;It's just a game! Isn't it? Hardly.  The relationship between sport and the
<br>
earnest fan is anything but gamelike.  It is a serious, intense, and highly
<br>
personal.&quot;...&quot;As distinguished author Isaac Asimov put it in describing our
<br>
reactions to the contests we view, 'All things being equal, you root for
<br>
your own sex, your own culture, your own locality....and what you want to
<br>
prove is that you are better than the other person.  Whomever you root for
<br>
represents you; and when he wins, you win.'  When viewed in this light, the
<br>
passion of the sports fan begins to make sense. The game is no light
<br>
diversion to be enjoyed for its inherent form of artistry.  The self is at
<br>
stake.&quot;
<br>
<p>He goes on to talk about how it is the association with the team that
<br>
affects our public image that makes it so important.  We have a &quot;desire to
<br>
bask in reflected glory,&quot; and people with a poorer self-concept need the
<br>
glory of the team to boost their sense of personal worth.  In that respect,
<br>
to some people it actually is about life and death.
<br>
<p>Hope this was at least slightly helpful in portraying one argument for the
<br>
cause of such fan frenzy.
<br>
