Lee Corbin noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Talk about &quot;advanced ETI's&quot; somehow remaining aloof 
<br>
from our planet is merely emotionally appealing SF.
<br>
&quot;There aren't any&quot;; that's the answer to the Fermi
<br>
question.
<br>
<p>Lee Corbin&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Just to chime in on this matter, I agree with LC to a great extent. My only 
<br>
caveats to his and Fermi's conclusion is that it has probably taken 10-13 
<br>
billion years for the cosmos to 'settle down' to the point where life can 
<br>
develop, expand, and evolve. Secondly, much to the chagrin of George Lucas, 
<br>
and Gene Roddenbury, technological life is probably pretty, freakin' rare in 
<br>
this cosmological era. What I am envisioning is the evolution of 
<br>
technological life every 100,000 years, in every Barred-Spiral galaxy (a 
<br>
guess) and that means for this galaxy--we is it, for now. Perhaps over the 
<br>
astronomical lifespan of a galaxy, of the barred-spiral type; it may produce 
<br>
20-200 such civilizations. Concluding, we have a few billion years to go 
<br>
before star material exhausts and everything is in white dwarf-ville, or 
<br>
neutron, or p-stars.
<br>
<p>Going to the Orions-Arm.org view of the deep future, we are more likely to, 
<br>
ourselves become Marvel Comic style X-Men, and send genetic, electronic, and 
<br>
cultural data, and replicate ourselves thus (perhaps narcissistically) among 
<br>
the galaxy. Additionally we have the Uplift phenomena, which may, in reality, 
<br>
be doable. Or not.
<br>
<p>Still, the SETI stuff may pan out after all and supply us with millenia of 
<br>
entertainment.
<br>
Its worth a good hunt.
