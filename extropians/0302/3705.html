I only recently discovered this provocative and creative article by
<br>
Tom W. Bell, who is hopefully known and respected by all of us, from
<br>
last October:
<br>
<a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/defensewrapper.jsp?PID=1051-350&amp;CID=1051-100402A">http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/defensewrapper.jsp?PID=1051-350&amp;CID=1051-100402A</a>0<br>
<p><em>&gt; The case for invading Iraq would command deeper and wider support,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, if we had good evidence that the Iraqi people want outside help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in overthrowing Saddam Hussein. But given his tyrannical grip on power,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how can we find out what his victim-citizens want? By bombing Iraq into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a democracy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine a &quot;ballot bomblet&quot; - a small, cheap, battery-powered device that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows one person one vote on one issue. U.S. military would scatter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ballots bomblets across Iraq in the same way that they might later scatter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explosive bomblets: by airborne express. Far from killing Iraqis, however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ballot bomblets could save them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Each ballot bomblet would transmit its single &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wirelessly to overhead planes or satellites, to secret local receiving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stations, or even to other ballot bomblets via a packet-switched,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peer-to-peer network. No matter how they get their messages out,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ballot bomblets would let the Iraqi people bypass Hussein's censorship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and express their opinions directly to the U.S. and the rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world. Only by voting from a distance - &quot;televoting&quot; - can those whom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hussein subjects to his rule freely voice their objections.
</em><br>
<p>I think this idea is best evaluated in a larger context than the specifics
<br>
of the current Iraq situation.  More generally it will undoubtedly be
<br>
the case for some time that the citizens of many countries will suffer
<br>
leadership which does not command popular support.  If some technology
<br>
like this could be used to make this fact public in an undeniable way,
<br>
it would impair the government's ability to distort the reality of the
<br>
situation and give itself a veneer of legitimacy.
<br>
<p>The transparency offered by &quot;ballot bomblets&quot; could be generalized to
<br>
other kinds of information channels.  I think there may have already
<br>
been campaigns to drop radios in some situations, and eventually even
<br>
internet access terminals will be small and cheap enough to be seeded
<br>
widely for availability to all.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately recent events have shown that even with access to
<br>
information, unfettered communications, and strong common interests,
<br>
communities can develop high levels of mutually hostile perceptions due
<br>
to cultural and historical differences.  I still hope and believe that
<br>
we will be able to develop new institutions and mechanisms that will
<br>
exploit the information flows of the modern age to reconcile these kinds
<br>
of differences.
<br>
<p>The direction I see as most promising is to separate values from facts,
<br>
and then to use something like Robin Hanson's Idea Futures market to
<br>
balance and moderate factual disagreements.  Think of the current disputes
<br>
between the U.S. and Europe as potential differences in the sense of
<br>
electricity or mechanics.  Then imagine that you could get rich off of
<br>
that differential.  Mechanisms to expose the costs of stupidity, to allow
<br>
people to literally profit from blindness and prejudice in others, could
<br>
go a huge way towards helping the human race to see with unclouded vision.
