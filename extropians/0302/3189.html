<br>
<p>Max, first let me say that I appreciate your deep knowledge of cold
<br>
war history and your thoughtful posts.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This gets to the heart of my problem with your argument. To 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest that the United States has had a foreign policy which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been &quot;the opposite&quot; of one that spreads democracy and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism is in my view at best unfair, if not dishonest.
</em><br>
<p>You're right.  Perhaps I should have said that US foreign policy,
<br>
historically, has been fairly indifferent to democracy.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Let me say now that I believe you and I are looking toward 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same thing, a free and democratic Iraq. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am of the opinion that US action in Iraq will have the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits for the Iraqi people, all the while satisfying our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal interests. I am also of the opinion, and only time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will tell the validity of it, that in the post-Soviet world, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US will be able to be more patient and allow more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic personalities to come to the fore. 
</em><br>
<p>I hope you are right.  To be completely clear, I agree with you that
<br>
the US *can* help build a democracy in Iraq.  And I think that can be
<br>
done even when our primary motive for invading is selfish.  Indeed,
<br>
building a democracy in Iraq serves our selfish interests in the long
<br>
turn.  The farther democracy spreads through the world, the safer and
<br>
more extropic the world becomes.
<br>
<p>However, building a democracy in Iraq will take a long, steady
<br>
commitment.  My complaint is that the administration has not displayed
<br>
a level of follow-through in their dealing with Afghanistan that
<br>
convinces me that they're up to the challenge of building democracy in
<br>
Iraq.  Even more importantly, Bush has not prepared the US public and
<br>
congress for the idea of a decade-long (or longer) engagement in Iraq.
<br>
That makes me deeply suspicious that we're going to install a
<br>
government and then leave the country to its own fate.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I for one do agree with your assertion that it will require a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prolonged US effort to see that a vibrant and free Iraq comes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pass. It is my opinion and my hope that they will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engaged in making the process work. However, the first steps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on that road do not need to be paved with altruism. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, as I've tried to make clear, spreading democracy and prosperity
<br>
through the world is beneficial from a purely selfish standpoint.
<br>
While I may be an altruist, I don't presume that the people I'm trying
<br>
to convince have any altruistic leanings.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
mez
