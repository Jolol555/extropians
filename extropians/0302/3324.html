<p>Uh huh.  Well, all the bullies I've ever met were generally 
<br>
bigger or at least able to hit damn hard.  Somehow it isn't 
<br>
Saddam that fits that image in the current situation.
<br>
<p>I don't favor fight or flight.  I favor finding more productive 
<br>
choices beginning with not reducing the world to simplistic 
<br>
&quot;analysis&quot;.  I favor building a world where all people have a 
<br>
strong and obvious stake in a future that increases the 
<br>
well-being and saftgety of everyone.  I don't think you get 
<br>
there by disowning large sections of the world or painting them 
<br>
as &quot;axis of Evil&quot;.  I don't think the reptilian brain is a lot 
<br>
of help either.
