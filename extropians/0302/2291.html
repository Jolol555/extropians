<p>&quot;The sense of self is an illusion.&quot;
<br>
<p>Assertions like this are missing a big part of the picture – the most important 
<br>
part of the picture!
<br>
<p>If this &quot;sense of self&quot; is an &quot;illusion&quot; – what then is this &quot;illusion&quot; made of?
<br>
<p>An &quot;illusion&quot; is some real conscious knowledge that inaccurately represents its 
<br>
referent.  For example, our knowledge of a pencil in a glass of water is not 
<br>
straight when the real pencil in the real glass of water is actually straight.  
<br>
We call this an illusion because our conscious knowledge doesn't accurately 
<br>
represent its referent.  But just saying it is an &quot;illusion&quot; doesn’t mean our 
<br>
conscious knowledge doesn't exist!  We know, more than we know anything else, 
<br>
that this conscious knowledge of the pencil exists regardless of the fact that 
<br>
it is an illusion and not straight.
<br>
<p>We also have conscious knowledge that is our &quot;I&quot; – even though there is nothing 
<br>
in physical reality that exists that this &quot;I&quot; represents.  We have conscious 
<br>
knowledge of our skull represented by our brain.  Inside this knowledge of our 
<br>
skull is real knowledge of an entity looking out through this knowledge of 
<br>
our &quot;eyes&quot;.  Just because this knowledge of this &quot;I&quot; is an illusion and there 
<br>
is nothing in reality that it is a referent of, doesn’t mean that it doesn't 
<br>
exist.
<br>
<p>I've written a short story and a paper on this topic that is available here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://home.attbi.com/~brent.allsop/">http://home.attbi.com/~brent.allsop/</a>
<br>
<p>In the short story I describe one possible way this conscious knowledge of 
<br>
this 'I' will be uploaded and what it will be subjectively like to experience 
<br>
such an upload.
<br>
<p>Always remember that even false conscious knowledge is still very phenomenally 
<br>
real!  We know this more than we know anything else.
<br>
<p>And the web is already self aware!  Google stores lots of information about the 
<br>
web.  Its just that this mathematical knowledge isn't phenomenally conscious 
<br>
knowledge of the web like that which exists in our brains.
