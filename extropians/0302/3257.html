&lt;&lt;Damien,
<br>
       If you are trying to say that the US hit Sadaam first then your syntax 
<br>
<p>may or may not be good but your facts are seriously faulty.  
<br>
       It is easy enough to say Sadaam &quot;may&quot; or again that he &quot;may not.&quot;  We 
<br>
don't intend to wait until he has hit the US nor until you openly agree with 
<br>
us.  He is going to great lengths in attempting to gain weapons with which he 
<br>
<p>can hit us or some other target.  That is as far as we intend to trust this 
<br>
man.
<br>
Ron h.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Let us cut to the chase, if we may, and re-direct the emphasis of this 
<br>
thread. I say the war will occur soon any way, no matter what the protestors 
<br>
say or do. I am in the pro-war camp, myself, though I cry my crocadile tears, 
<br>
I see no other way out of this. Big freakin' deal right? Fair enough.  Now 
<br>
what will those anti-War camp do now? 
<br>
<p>*Violent protests? 
<br>
*A reign of molotov cocktails ?
<br>
*Sit-ins ?
<br>
*Laying on tracks carrying military equipment ?
<br>
*A stern letter to the Times ?
<br>
*Death threats, pipe bombs ?
<br>
*Denial of service email attacks ?
<br>
*taking up arms against the American Imperialists ?
<br>
*Making common cause with the Iraqis, the Iranians,
<br>
the North Koreans?
<br>
<p>I am curious about this. How can you compell, the US to obey your will? What 
<br>
about breaking diplomatic relations, economic warfare of some sort? 
<br>
As Bill Safire said in the NY Times several years ago, &quot;Nothing is more 
<br>
powerful than power..&quot; A simple statement indeed, but one that needs to be 
<br>
considered. This question should be addressed, because the war is nearly 
<br>
here.
<br>
<p>Cheerfully Yours
<br>
Mitch
