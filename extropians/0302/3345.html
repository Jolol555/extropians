<em>&gt;     &gt; the people - you have cut my text most carefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; -  should be  able to decide for themself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but what on earth does that have to do with Iraq?
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. The US regime wont let the people of Iraq decide for themself. 
<br>
Instead, the victims of Saddam will now also become victims of the US. 
<br>
This is neither democratic nor free.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; I don't believe a bit of this &quot;we have to bring freedom and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; democracy&quot; rubbish. This will be a side effect, if it will happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't care if it's a side effect.
</em><br>
<p>I am pretty sure it won't happen at all. The campaigns for the 2004 
<br>
elections will start a few months after the supposed war. Mr. Bush will 
<br>
have to defend 600+x billion dollars of debts of which not a single cent 
<br>
has been spend for civilian purposes. i.e for the benefit of the people. 
<br>
He'll have to justify an economic breakdown (ah, what the heck, he has 
<br>
already ruined 3 other companies before), substantial loss of freedom, 
<br>
democracy, human rights and fair justice. To spend some more billion 
<br>
dollars to rebuild Iraq would be his political end. The reconstruction of 
<br>
the Iraqi oil industry will take circa a decade. So this is business for 
<br>
his time after being president (his pension, so to speak). He may be able 
<br>
to put up another scape goat to go after, though. As I said, there are 
<br>
strong interest groups that will try to turn his attention away from Iraq 
<br>
to get their share.
<br>
<p>So, IMO, (1) Mr. Bush will be most grateful for every distraction from 
<br>
the Iraq desaster to keep up the level of fear among the US people that 
<br>
justifies his politics. (2) Whoever will win the 2004 elections will not 
<br>
invest money, people or anything else into the reconstruction of Iraq, as 
<br>
long as US based companies control the oil resources. (3) Therefore, 
<br>
there will not be any democratic progress in Iraq after a war now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        &gt; These so called &quot;evidences&quot; wouldn't stand any trial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I really wish you were right but there is not a doubt in my mind you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be proven to be spectacularly wrong in just a few weeks, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days.
</em><br>
<p>I'll keep this mail until some years have passed and we maybe get some 
<br>
truth out of this propaganda war. As I said before, US regimes of the 
<br>
past haven't hesitated to lie to justify wars; Vietnam: That canon boat 
<br>
incedent. Grenada: The &quot;military&quot; airport that was not military. Gulf war 
<br>
I: The video about the slaughtered babys - faked and filmed by the CIA in 
<br>
London and the interview of an &quot;eye witness&quot; who happened to be the 
<br>
daugther of the Kuwaiti ambassador in Washington and hasn't even been 
<br>
near Kuwait at that time. Now we are talking about high-school level 
<br>
fabrication of chemicals or bio-chemicals in garage-like laboratories. No 
<br>
secret service in the whole western world has any hard facts that this 
<br>
stuff really exists. The alleged tons of viruses and chemicals have 
<br>
melted down to some cans, not usable as a WMD, because Iraq lacks the 
<br>
technology to prepare the fine powder. 
<br>
<p>This is the most ingenious scape goat ever made, because it's even 
<br>
invisible. That's the essence of what Mr. Powell presented to the UN: He 
<br>
has no facts that Iraq has WMDs, so he simply declared the hypothesis 
<br>
(Iraq has WMDs) to be an axiom (or dogma), therefore it cannot be 
<br>
discussed and the only answer left, why there are no hard facts is that 
<br>
Iraq must be so incredible[sic!] clever and dangerous that he can make 
<br>
all of this totally invisible.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately for Mr. Powell, some of the &quot;evidences&quot; found another 
<br>
explanation. Some truck movements, supposed container labs for WMDs, were 
<br>
inspected by the UN (that should be the scheme: total surveillance and 
<br>
immediate check on the ground). The inspectors found that these were 
<br>
ordinary troop transporters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      &gt;One could get the impression that the US administration is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;more carefull and diplomatic, the more WMDs a country has.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No shit Sherlock. It's too late to deal with North Korea or Pakistan,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's almost too late to deal with Iraq but perhaps not quite.
</em><br>
<p>You mean, if Iraq really had WMDs, the US would not use military force 
<br>
(because it'd be too dangerous) but &quot;deal with it diplomatically&quot;?
<br>
<p>If you don't have WMDs, we'll come and get you, just because we can, but 
<br>
if you really have WMDs, you are safe?
<br>
<p>Pardon, but if some small state is only safe from US foreign (military) 
<br>
politics if it has WMDs, wouldn't every dictator like Saddam try to 
<br>
really get WMDs as fast as possible? And since B and C WMDs can 
<br>
supposedly be produced in every high-school lab, isn't this US policy 
<br>
stupid, if not outright idiotic?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      &gt;You think a war  against Iraq will make the world a safer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;place?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly, but what I don't know is how high a price we must pay to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve it.
</em><br>
<p>What about starting with several hunderd thousand people dead, mutilated, 
<br>
starved to death, died of trival deseases? Ok, no US citizens, therefore 
<br>
maybe &quot;expendable&quot; from some presidents point of view. What about another 
<br>
region less to go for holiday or business? What about some thousand new 
<br>
possible suicide bombers and a dozen new bin Ladins?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;             &gt;It will turn Iraq into a bazaar for weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unlike the happy peaceful place Iraq is today.
</em><br>
<p>No, unlike the relatively &quot;ordered&quot; place the Iraq is today. No islamic 
<br>
terrorists, no fundamentalism, except for the small clique of mad men in 
<br>
the administration.
