</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, that's not what he said.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for your elucidation below, but what I wrote still sounds
<br>
like what he (and you) are saying.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's start with a dose of reality:  Just what significance has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position of Poland etc. in the big picture?  These countries cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project military force; if any of them happen to be in the Security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Council they have no veto power; they do not have the financial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources to significantly contribute either to a war effort or to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rebuilding afterwards.  In short, their position is irrelevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in practice and only an expression of moral support and political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; association.
</em><br>
<p>What?  Are you saying that might makes right?  So it's
<br>
okay that Germany or England speak up, but not appropriate
<br>
for the little guys?  This really is a cultural divide
<br>
between you and the Anglosphere.  In some places, like Oz,
<br>
giving the underdog a &quot;fair go&quot; is almost a national
<br>
obsession.
<br>
<p>Even in the U.S., there exists an egalitarian spirit
<br>
that seems foreign to what you say.  Besides, we have
<br>
this meme, this idea, especially on this list, that it's
<br>
okay for anyone to say anything they want.  (We only
<br>
debate the *wisdom* of what they say, not the propriety,
<br>
or the wisdom of speaking up itself.)
<br>
<p>Now if you or Chirac really blasted &quot;those idiots&quot; in
<br>
Eastern Europe &quot;for wrecking the chances of peace&quot;, or
<br>
any other thing you might say, that would be one thing.
<br>
But to attempt to intimidate and threaten them---well,
<br>
we just shake our heads at that.
<br>
<p>But thanks---it's becoming clearer that many Europeans
<br>
see power politics as more explicit (and less subtle)
<br>
than we do here.  The bullying can be upfront, instead
<br>
of hidden.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You might be under the assumption that those countries expressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their true support for the USA because of a common stance against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totalitarianism etc.  Around here, the perception is that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather sucked up to the USA out of political opportunism.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, it's fair to question someone's motives too.  But
<br>
this is to be done separately.  After all, it's speculation.
<br>
Who knows what Byzantine motives people or nations really have?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As you may know if you follow European politics, there have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ongoing efforts for the last several years to forge a common European
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign policy in order for Europe to be able to speak with a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and correspondingly more powerful voice.  The candidate countries--who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after all have much to gain from EU membership--now seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sabotaging this effort, which is already painful enough as is.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, then you TELL THEM THIS.  You TELL THEM THIS publicly, even.
<br>
And maybe---if you think that you can get away with it---you lower
<br>
yourself to privately threatening them.  But if it comes out, then
<br>
(at least in the Anglosphere) you look pretty bad for doing it.
<br>
<p>What was amazing to me, though you are helping to explain it,
<br>
is that to the French, and maybe Germans, Chirac didn't look
<br>
bad at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you want something from somebody, you don't start by offending them.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, for having plainly spoken their minds, those hopeful
<br>
entrants to the EU may have made a big mistake.  One does
<br>
not dare question La France publicly.  The very idea!
<br>
<p>(&quot;Revenge&quot; is a gallic word.)
