<p>Me too. My participation here has been particularly spotty
<br>
recently due to the demand of writing a dissertation and working
<br>
for a think tank, but even without these time constraints I would 
<br>
seriously have considered dropping the list. 
<br>
<p>What irritates me the most is not the cluster of aggressive 
<br>
posters - they can be ignored. What really bothers me is the 
<br>
spread of an attitude. It is an attitude of &quot;hobby 
<br>
transhumanism&quot;, where transhumanism is seen as something cool to 
<br>
play around with but without real effect on how one lives one's 
<br>
life. Where is the self-improvement? The most important part 
<br>
isn't about what supplements to take or how to work out, but how 
<br>
to extend one's thinking, knowledge and understanding in an 
<br>
extropic way. I see far too many closed minds, trapped in 
<br>
conformist politics or standardized worldviews that are not 
<br>
attempting to grow. I would like to see a list where everyone is 
<br>
doing their outmost to become more, to come up with *better* 
<br>
solutions rather than just quoting the solutions others have 
<br>
talked about forever, and to demonstrate their utility by 
<br>
reasoned arguments that fitted speaking with a transhuman rather 
<br>
than a child. 
<br>
<p>OK, this may be a bit unlikely to just happen. But we can each
<br>
hold it as an ideal to strive to wards and make parts of it true.
<br>
<p><p><p>BTW, Amara, beautiful visualisation of the dust streams!
