Resolution 1441 is actually the one solid reason that I've seen that might
<br>
justify war with Iraq. I don't think it binds the signatories to attack, but
<br>
does give them the option (subject to restrictions that Brett noted in his
<br>
excellent post). Whether that option should be exercised is another matter
<br>
entirely.
