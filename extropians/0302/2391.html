<p>Phenolic anti-inflammatory antioxidant reversal of
<br>
Abeta-induced cognitive deficits and neuropathology

<br>
<p>ABSTRACT
<br>
Both oxidative damage and inflammation have been implicated in age-related
<br>
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The yellow
<br>
curry spice, curcumin, has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities
<br>
which confer significant protection against neurotoxic and genotoxic agents.
<br>
We used 22 month Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to compare the effects of the
<br>
conventional NSAID, ibuprofen, and curcumin for their ability to protect
<br>
against amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)-induced damage. Lipoprotein
<br>
carrier-mediated, intracerebroventricular infusion of Abeta peptides induced
<br>
oxidative damage, synaptophysin loss, a microglial response and widespread
<br>
Abeta deposits. Dietary curcumin (2000 ppm), but not ibuprofen, suppressed
<br>
oxidative damage (isoprostane levels) and synaptophysin loss. Both ibuprofen
<br>
and curcumin reduced microgliosis in cortical layers, but curcumin increased
<br>
microglial labeling within and adjacent to Abeta-ir deposits. In a second
<br>
group of middle-aged female SD rats, 500 ppm dietary curcumin prevented
<br>
Abeta-infusion induced spatial memory deficits in the Morris Water Maze and
<br>
post-synaptic density (PSD)-95 loss and reduced Abeta deposits. Because of
<br>
its low side-effect profile and long history of safe use, curcumin may find
<br>
clinical application for AD prevention.

<em>&gt; &gt; Gentlemen;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I do not know if this is relevant to your discussion, and please forgive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me for butting in, but...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...'Geddy' has been taking Selegiline (R-(-)-Deprenyl hydrochloride)  @
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 20mg daily  since 21st December 2002. Geddy is a 44-year-old male human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in average health who does not suffer from any neurological disorder,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and is basically taking selegiline to see what happens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We are monitoring him. He intends to stay on the drug indefinitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unless there are deleterious effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For obvious reasons Geddy wishes to remain low-profile! We're happy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discuss this trial and any clinical results if contacted WITH PGP at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  <a href="mailto:alex@ramonsky.com?Subject=Re:%20Performance%20enhancement%20with%20selegiline">alex@ramonsky.com</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He is however happy for the world to know the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He has noticed several changes since beginning the trial. The first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; change was an increase in confidence, he felt calmer and less shy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was able to communicate more easily. He felt more confident and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assertive in business environments. Then he noticed that an annoying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nervous habit of wiggling his toes had stopped. He feels he can control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his emotions more sensibly and think more rationally under stress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; His dreams have become more vivid, and he feels his fantasy life and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; imagination have improved. He explains an odd sensation of 'thinking too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fast to be able to verbalise it', which is the only downer so far. On
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the whole he seems a great deal happier as an individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We may have to wait some time to see if he lives longer, of course. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other data are coming in, all along the way. As far as I know, this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the first trial of a healthy human?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; : )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AR
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### If he's happy with it, more power to him. It is not proven that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selegiline will make you live longer, but then it won't cut your life
</em><br>
short,
<br>
<em>&gt; either. As long as it makes the user lead a happy, useful life, it's good.
</em><br>
