<em>&gt; Well, hmm, that sounds implausible.

</em><br>
<p>I was watching yesterday and a reporter asked about if the shuttle had a 
<br>
&quot;black box&quot; flight recorder and the official said that it didn't have one. 
<br>
How many millions of dollars the thing was worth and they don't have BLACK 
<br>
BOXES??? That seems very strange to me, and I know that they have a 
<br>
continuous stream of data coming down through telemetry, but STILL?
<br>
<p>Also, doesn't the shuttle have some sort of emergency eject system? Of 
<br>
course, if they were at too high an altitude, or the explosion was too sudden 
<br>
for a crew reaction, this wouldn't be useable in any event, but I would think 
<br>
that the designers would have tried to account for such occurrances. Maybe 
<br>
making the entire crew cabin explosion-proof, sealed off from the rest of the 
<br>
craft during liftoff and reentry, and maybe a redundant chute/airbag kind of 
<br>
system? Does anyone have info on this?
