Anders,
<br>
<p>I'm not sure that I can add much to what you wrote. I agree with you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Since we often mimick what we experience, and much of our experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comes through the media there is a strong feedback loop where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;journalists and other media producers also get caught in typical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;working&quot; narratives and make them more common.
</em><br>
<p>It's almost a which-comes-first:-chicken-or-the-egg pictre, because
<br>
what we would like to see in the media are positive images; however
<br>
those reflect to some extent (in your feedback loop) the experiences
<br>
of the 'typical' person, whose actions are influenced by the media,
<br>
which reflects the experiences of .. and so on.
<br>
<p>The only way I see how to break out of this feedback loop is not to
<br>
pay too much attention to the media at all, but to focus on the
<br>
individual: Support the individual positive images and
<br>
accomplishments, and hope that the media picks up those stories, or at
<br>
the least, something helpful or wonderful naturally emerges which we
<br>
can use to support the larger group. However, this what the various
<br>
transhuman groups are already doing, yes? (or no?)
<br>
<p>If no, then encourage people to get back to that, the 'Basics', if you
<br>
will. Acting individually on positive-reinforcements instead of
<br>
fear-based-reinforcements is probably (and practically) more effective and
<br>
longer-lasting. However these positive stories don't get picked up by the
<br>
media often enough, but perhaps we shouldn't care overly much for how
<br>
the media portrays transhumans presently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What really got people pro-space in the tragedy was the mythical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspects - the disaster itself just got people to sit up and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;notice a myth that has been rather silent for a while (but now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also fits in with the somewhat more 40's/50's narrative elsewhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the media). Heroes dying on the way back to Ithaca in a great
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fireball. The promethean determination to dare dangers and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;occasional punishment for hubris in order to rise up to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stars.
</em><br>
<p>Yes... I have some text of how the mythic aspects of transhumanism is
<br>
important for it to succeed, here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.transhumanism.com/articles/2002/graps0202.php">http://www.transhumanism.com/articles/2002/graps0202.php</a>
<br>
<p>One point of the above essay is that the positive 'stories' come not
<br>
externally imposed from the outside, but from the individual exploring
<br>
their internal life stories. Already existing mythic templates can
<br>
provide clues and aid you from other human's experiences. Future mythic
<br>
templates naturally emerge on their own if enough clear voices are heard
<br>
to forge a  cohesive path in a particular set of transhuman life
<br>
experiences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Transhumanism can of course be clothed in the same mythical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;narrative, but the risk is that one looks more at the heroism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than the practical results - it is a basically romantic notion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looking more to ethos and pathos than logos.
</em><br>
<p><p>True, but I sense that the world could use a few more positive images,
<br>
and a few more heroes could aid in that. How one responds to or uses
<br>
those positive images practically in one's own life is yet another issue.
<br>
