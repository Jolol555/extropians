Dickey, Michael F:
<br>
<em>&gt;Bringing about a better world for all humans is not only going to happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through science and technology, but will necessarily require changes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;politics, economics, and the humanities, and as such a concentrated effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to bring about that better world
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p>And I'm sorry I'm not saying very much- my Internet access and
<br>
time here is pretty limited. Also, I'm not talkative on email lists
<br>
generally these days.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That disagreement here between 'hawks' and 'doves' essentially comes down to
</em><br>
<p>I don't see the disagreements here that way. In my view, 'hawks' and
<br>
'doves' is a narrow view, which doesn't help anyone understand each
<br>
other better because they are labels that pidgeon-hole someone and
<br>
closes people's ears that could be used for listening. I'm 100% pro
<br>
life and I prefer to view and live my world in that way. I don't think
<br>
that I'm a dreamer, because I have experienced a wide range of
<br>
perspectives/lives, at the same time, I don't think that I am a static
<br>
realist, because I have a long (and idealistic) time view of my life
<br>
and the life of the people I care about. So while I see divisions
<br>
between people (political, cultural, etc.) they don't strike me as a
<br>
hard barrier for me to get from here to there. And usually if
<br>
something difficult happens (and I have had a history of difficult
<br>
challenges), I look at the possible life-enhancing aspects. Perhaps
<br>
that is where I clash with some folks here,  in that, I sense often
<br>
with them a wish to crush the difficult things instead of working with
<br>
those things and using them to grow and learn and be bigger and
<br>
better.
<br>
<p>End of monologue. Thunder and lightening beginning again - should get
<br>
on my bike to go home before the storm starts.
<br>
