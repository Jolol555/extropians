</em><br>
<p><p>Which reminds me.  I was talking to my dad about this earlier today, and
<br>
he mentioned that the white tiles used for the shuttle's upper body
<br>
would make great housing material except for the cost: excellent
<br>
insulators, totally fire and termite proof, strength to weight ratios
<br>
far more than adequate for a typical house, et cetera and so forth.  The
<br>
only problem would be cost - which, of course, is often a killer for
<br>
this kind of thing.  But he was wondering if, perhaps, getting some
<br>
contractors hooked on using these for housing materials would drive the
<br>
point down, such that making them for the occasional spaceship would be
<br>
a cheap custom job rather than the elaborate undertaking it presently
<br>
seems to be.  (Then again, everything at NASA seems to be an elaborate
<br>
undertaking, so maybe it's not the material's fault.)  Can anyone here
<br>
with any experience in this comment on this possibility?
