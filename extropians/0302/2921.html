<p>For the record, I'm still undecided and ambivalent.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Someone tell me, poor silly fool that I am, why anyone would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to go to war with Iraq?
</em><br>
<p>Here's the best reason I can articulate: In 1991 Saddam Hussein agreed
<br>
to the terms of an armistice that mandated complete disarmament of WMDs
<br>
and transparent disclosure of all information regarding the WMD programs
<br>
Iraq had at the time.  This shifted the burden of proof to the Baghdad
<br>
regime to prove they had completely disarmed.  Hussein has not complied
<br>
with that complete disclosure and, over the last 12 years, has
<br>
repeatedly interfered with attempts to verify his compliance.  On a
<br>
purely legalistic basis, this is a breach of the terms of the armistice
<br>
and restores the situation to the status quo ante, i.e. UN-sanctioned
<br>
hostilities between the coalition powers and Iraq.  Further, given the
<br>
shifting of the burden of proof inherent in the terms of the armistice,
<br>
those favoring war can argue that we can presume Iraq's possession of
<br>
WMDs, justifying forced disarmament.  These are &quot;reasons&quot; to go to war
<br>
with Iraq in the simple sense that failure to do so undermines the force
<br>
of all international order: If the Baghdad regime can violate the terms
<br>
of the armistice with impunity, then no treaty is worth the paper it's
<br>
written on.
<br>
<p>Given the above, I'd say there is an ironclad &quot;legal&quot; argument
<br>
supporting resumption of hostilities against Iraq to carry through to
<br>
fulfillment the terms of the armistice.  Over against this are less
<br>
clear-cut, but nonetheless weighty arguments of diplomacy, statecraft
<br>
and humanitarianism, none of which support one side or the other of the
<br>
debate without doubt.  Thus my ambivalence.
