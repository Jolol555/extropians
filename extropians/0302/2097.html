<br>
<p>Chris,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds like an attractive idea that upon reflection is highly 
<br>
defective.  During the days when everyone thought the Earth was flat Gallileo 
<br>
would have been voted down.  And, if he persisted I suppose he would have 
<br>
been censored and possibly even disciplined if he persisted further.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That illustrates why some prefer a republic to a democracy.  There has 
<br>
to been guarantees for the minority.  Are you intending to give the majority 
<br>
the right
<br>
&nbsp;to do anything at all that they wish to the minority?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have saved Amara's latest contribution -- the one beginning, &quot;I 
<br>
don't see the disagreements here that way. In my view, 'hawks' and 'doves' is 
<br>
a narrow view, which doesn't help anyone understand each other better because 
<br>
they are labels that pidgeon-hole someone and closes people's ears that could 
<br>
be used for listening.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if her viewpoint or viewpoints had been censored by the vote of 
<br>
the majority?  She presented a view that I would never have imagined she had 
<br>
and frankly I would have been diminished by not having the privilege of 
<br>
reading what she has just written.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the term to apply to the present situation is that it is 
<br>
some form of a dialectic.  We argue it is true but we also inform and out of 
<br>
the complex circumstances of our discussions I believe we grow and learn.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As those that feel timid in presenting their case.  Well, in that case 
<br>
I can only speak for myself.  But I am reminded of Carl Sandburg's old story. 
<br>
&nbsp;Mr. Sandburg was very active at one time in the politics of the Democrat 
<br>
Party.  He saw a friend carrying a club and asked his friend where he was 
<br>
going.  His friend answered that he was on his way to a Democrat unity 
<br>
meeting.  That is not verbatim but close -- I think.  So, speak up, we aren't 
<br>
nearly that bad.  &lt;G&gt;
<br>
