I'm going to do something that is perhaps ill advised, and take this post at
<br>
face value...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I won't change my life for the latest government / media report of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the scare-of-the-week, because it looks like more  Paranoia-Ville.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and I refuse to buy into that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can't express how strongly I agree with this. Like Amara 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am both amazed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and disturbed by the obsession so many people have with an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unattainable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ideal of &quot;safety&quot;, to the point that they are prepared to sacrifice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything else to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am frankly bewildered by this.  Am I not watching enough television
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or something?  The people at work and on this list seem rather normal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I'm not hearing of untoward incidents in the Bay Area (that is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; California).  I did hear one report of a guy back east who wrapped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his entire house in plastic, but I thought that this was an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aberration.
</em><br>
<p>I think both Steve and Amara are talking about a more general propensity in
<br>
people toward letting fear dominate their thinking, and thus behaviour.
<br>
They're not talking specifically about mad survivalism.
<br>
<p>The problem is with a general trend toward a focus on safety and security,
<br>
rising from fear, in the west. It comes out in all kinds of funny little
<br>
ways, like people buying really big stupid cars (because they feel safer),
<br>
or people deciding they need guns under their pillows, or even people taking
<br>
a boring but career oriented job instead of doing what they really want to
<br>
do with their lives.
<br>
<p>It also comes out in more sinister ways. Our government (here I might
<br>
restrict myself to talking about Australia, but much of it applies to the
<br>
US) absolutely preys on the fears of middle australia, and has done since it
<br>
came into office (a lot of years ago, help me google!). 
<br>
<p>A very specific example to Australia is the ongoing public illegal immigrant
<br>
freakout that has occured here particularly in the last few years. Our
<br>
government (specifically federal, most specifically the PM) has gone to
<br>
extraordinary lengths to make us fearful of illegal immigrants turning up
<br>
here in massive numbers (in boats! sheesh) and swamping us or eating all our
<br>
hamburgers or something (it was never clear what the terrible consequences
<br>
would be I think). And people lapped it up. So what do we have as a result?
<br>
Concentration camps full of &quot;illegals&quot; (if you ask the govt) or
<br>
&quot;refugees&quot;(if you ask the people themselves), locked up for years as if they
<br>
were criminals. Turning away unseaworthy vessels from our waters (with at
<br>
least one mass drowning as a result). Internment of refugees on little
<br>
islands in the specific (Nauru? wtf?) in the middle of the specific, away
<br>
from nosy media (poor buggers).
<br>
<p>We have been soundly critisized for these practices, and rightly so imo, by
<br>
many humanitarian groups, including the UN (a human rights bit of the UN?).
<br>
<p>Other examples include the early demonisation of youth in Australia by our
<br>
current government, with many media reports of home invasions, lots of focus
<br>
of lazy dole bludging young people, etc. The result? Massive reduction in
<br>
social services for young people from the government, including effective
<br>
dismantlement of welfare for people under 23 (25?), and an increase in fear
<br>
among middle australia.
<br>
<p>And now, we've had the growing example of the mother of all scare campaigns,
<br>
beginning just after September 11 and continuing, with increased frenzy, at
<br>
the present moment. The War of Terror is a war on a concept. &quot;Terror&quot; is a
<br>
difficult enemy to pin down, but it scares the willies out of simple folk
<br>
(seemingly about 80% of the population). Now we're about to go to war with
<br>
Iraq, which I wont go into here, suffice it to say that the fear tactics
<br>
being used by the government are constant, and fairly unsubtle. There is a
<br>
campaign asking us to look out for terrorists in our midst, and report on
<br>
them to the government, with the slogan &quot;Be alert, not alarmed&quot; (which
<br>
invokes thought processes like &quot;Not alarmed? Why? Is there something I might
<br>
be alarmed about? Is it really that bad? Oh shit!&quot;).
<br>
<p>The result of these things combined, in this country, is a slow cultural
<br>
change, away from what has been a relatively open, accepting, friendly kind
<br>
of place (with its quirks, admittedly), and toward a fearful, closed,
<br>
suspicious mentality that results in us doing things as a nation that most
<br>
of us would be horrified to be personally involved with (like turning away
<br>
or incarcerating refugees, like putting young people on the streets, like
<br>
seriously considering attacking countries on the other side of the world
<br>
just in case). We have moved from a high trust society in the direction of a
<br>
low trust society.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; [The] powerful feed and stimulate panic and paranoia. They 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ascribable motives but why has this mania got such a hold 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; public, particularly (I have to say) in Anglo-Saxon countries?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What mania is this?  People seem about as unconcerned as all during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sixties when the chances of personal injury (due to atomic war)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were actually much greater.  Yes, starting in the eighties, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a certain amount of &quot;panic&quot;, but mostly in intellectual circles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the nuclear overkill, nuclear winter, and so on, and that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed been replaced by worries about global warming, genetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modified foods, alien abductions and so on; but the people who I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that are worried about the latter seem to be affected in only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a superficial matter---almost as though some part of them regarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it merely as entertainment.  In short, they didn't exhibit real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symptoms of worry and anxiety.
</em><br>
<p>The mania in question is an obsession with personal safety. More
<br>
insidiously, it is a negative obsession with the self which goes beyond the
<br>
rational into nasty, low trust thoughts and behaviour. I say its insidious,
<br>
because it is the unspoken motivator behind all the little collective
<br>
&quot;defector&quot; actions that end up making our social environment very much
<br>
degraded and dangerous for us all.
<br>
<p>Very importantly, I must here assert that I am indeed a transhumanist, and
<br>
an individualist. I have come to the position over many years that
<br>
individualism is an important conerstone of the future that I'd like to be a
<br>
part of. So I do believe in a focus on the individual, in a decentralised
<br>
approach to decentralised problems, in favouring innovation and
<br>
experimentation over supposed safety and control.
<br>
<p>However, I do believe that the individual focus encouraged by our government
<br>
is an extremely negative one, because the context in which it is placed is
<br>
that of central control. We are encouraged to fear for our security, our
<br>
material positions, and our social status (ye gods!). The kicker is that the
<br>
solution to our ills is in oppressive centralised controls - incarceration,
<br>
increased police powers, increased surveillance, increased military action,
<br>
increased censorship. In short, the solution to our fears about personal
<br>
safety is to relinquish our personal freedoms to the central authority.
<br>
<p>This slow creep toward what can only be thought of as democratic
<br>
totalitarianism also seems evident in the US, and I think it is a shared
<br>
problem. Indeed, the current generation of our governing party has always
<br>
modelled the US in its policies (they just aren't very creative).
<br>
<p>Hopefully it makes sense when I say that I think this trend to low trust,
<br>
fearful, self serving behaviour is only superficially individualistic; it is
<br>
when analysed more closely an extremely successful tactic employed by the
<br>
worst kind of central authoritarians. Extropianism in particular, founded on
<br>
dynamic optimism (remember dynamic optimism??) should recoil in horror
<br>
(though not in fear :-) ) from regressive modern social trends.
<br>
<p>Transhumanism and extropianism comprise a vision of a vastly different
<br>
different world from what is being created today by our politicians. For me,
<br>
this is the heart of why I get so riled up about this war on Iraq, as a
<br>
specific example; its because I see it as a really nasty symptom of the
<br>
underlying problem. This really taxes my dynamic optimism, I must tell you!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I find myself more and more frustrated and sad to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see people's obsession with fearful thoughts. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I were to speculate, I might wonder if some of us are more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than others, and if that were somehow at the base of it.  But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to entertain any kind of explanation, so bemused am I.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I haven't noticed whatever it is Amara and Steve are talking about,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless we've got a communication problem/misunderstanding at work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is my alternative explanation... some of us disagree fundamentally with
<br>
the defacto idealogy of the modern west, that being a culture of fear and a
<br>
negative individual obsession with unachievable personal goals like (total)
<br>
safety and security. We disagree with these because they run counter to the
<br>
fundamentals of true individualistic philosophies, transhumanism in
<br>
particular. I was utterly stunned when, post Sept 11, many people who had
<br>
formerly been raving libertarians, became raving statists and warmongers.
<br>
Preposterous! How can you reconcile an ideology of individualism, optimism,
<br>
and freedom, with networks of civilian spies, massive military mobilisation,
<br>
and the general and ongoing degradation of freedoms that have come in the
<br>
ensuing years?
<br>
<p>I've been accused of being a socialist on this list enough times over the
<br>
years that I can't quite grok the fact that I even have to post this.
<br>
Remember who we are.
