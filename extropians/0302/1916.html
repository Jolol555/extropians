<em> &gt; Gates argues that starting from scratch doesn't make software more

secure.

<p>&quot;Best&quot; being subjective.  Certainly, the human body - and most other
<br>
products of biological evolution - can be and are &quot;hacked&quot; by a number
<br>
of virii on a regular basis, some of which are quite damaging.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Quiz: is Bill Gates:

</em><br>
<em> &gt; D. in desperate need of having his prescriptions adjusted
</em><br>
<p>Metaphorically, perhaps.  True, that would be a way to make sure all the
<br>
neat little features Windows has built up over the years don't have to
<br>
be recreated (or forgotten entirely), but it places somewhat less of a
<br>
value on security than most readers of this list do.  (&quot;Security?  Sure,
<br>
it'd be nice, but if someone hacks into a system once in a while, we can
<br>
live with it.&quot; vs. &quot;By doing things this way, we can make sure no one
<br>
ever gets unauthorized access save by social engineering, which means we
<br>
can trust our lives to these machines in some cases - for instance, when
<br>
everyone with access knows their lives *do* depend on not giving
<br>
unauthorized access to their pacemakers et al, and what that entails.&quot;)
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Next week, Bill Gates will explain why rubbish heaps are actually 
</em><br>
superior
<br>
<em> &gt; to art galleries, because nothing is ever thrown out of a rubbish heap.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;They're the sum total of our civilization&quot;, sources report he will say.
</em><br>
<p>To be fair, most archaeologists interested in serious study of what a
<br>
culture was actually like would rather find a Roman trash heap than a
<br>
Roman art gallery, for pretty much that reason.
