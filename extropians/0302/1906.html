<p><em>&gt; The Saturn Vs seemed to fit that bill, if you ask me.
</em><br>
<p>Could be, or something simpler and smaller, use a gas pressure fuel system;
<br>
turbo pumps are expensive complicated and unreliable, fuel tanks are simple
<br>
cheap and reliable. True, the vehicles would be heavier but the true measure
<br>
of efficiency is not weight versus thrust but cost versus payload. This
<br>
really highlights what a complete and utter failure the entire shuttle
<br>
program is, and this was obvious well before the present tragedy.
<br>
The Shuttle was supposed to dramatically lower the cost of getting into
<br>
space but turned out to be more expensive than the Saturn and unlike the
<br>
Saturn was limited to low earth orbit, not exactly prime space real-estate.
<br>
They say the Shuttle does science but the stuff it does seldom makes it
<br>
to respected peer reviewed journals, it's a caricature of science, they take
<br>
ant farms into space, blow bubbles, bring science fair projects from high
<br>
school kids, and take geriatric senators on joy rides. It's not science but
<br>
nothing really wrong with any of those things except it cost about a
<br>
billion dollars a flight. It doesn't even have entertainment value, people
<br>
in tin cans just 200 up have spun around the earth for over 40 years
<br>
and people are board with it. NASA could produce ten times as much
<br>
good science with a quarter of its present budget if it would just stop
<br>
manned space flight.
