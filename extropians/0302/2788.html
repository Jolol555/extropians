Whatever, Rafal. As I was saying, it is clear that your ego is firmly
<br>
entrenched in your self-prescribed role as nay-sayer on this subject.
<br>
The FDA has a less progressive attitude than you, my friend, and I am no
<br>
fan of the FDA.
<br>
<p>Below is yet *another* positive research finding concerning selegiline
<br>
(deprenyl). In this double blind controlled study, selegiline was found
<br>
to improve verbal memory in Alzheimer's patients (we've been discussing
<br>
Parkinson's here, mostly, but selegiline (deprenyl) has also been found
<br>
useful in Alzheimer's).
<br>
<p>Concerning this report below of enhanced verbal memory from selegiline
<br>
(deprenyl), this is probably a good time for me to mention the most
<br>
surprising and unusual benefit that I *personally* have experienced from
<br>
this drug: 
<br>
<p>Immediately, literally on the day of my first 1 mg dose, I noticed a
<br>
dramatic improvement in my ability to understand the lyrics in music.
<br>
Lyrics that had previously been lost in the loud background
<br>
instrumentals suddenly became discernible to me. Popular tunes that I
<br>
had heard and enjoyed literally hundreds of times over the years on the
<br>
radio, but without understanding most of the lyrics, suddenly made
<br>
lyrical sense to me. Moreover my general appreciation of music improved
<br>
along with my ability to understand the lyrics. This increased ability
<br>
to appreciate lyrical music was entirely surprising to me. I would guess
<br>
that this positive effect is related to the enhancement of verbal memory
<br>
as seen in these Alzheimer's patients:
<br>
<p>ABSTRACT:
<br>
L-deprenyl therapy improves verbal memory
<br>
in amnesic Alzheimer patients.

<br>
<p>ABSTRACT 
<br>
<p>Altered monoaminergic neurotransmission could play an important role in
<br>
the cognitive dysfunctions typical of dementia of the Alzheimer type
<br>
(DAT).  DAT is not, however, a homogenous phenomenon inasmuch as two
<br>
forms are distinguishable: early onset (EO) and late onset (LO).
<br>
Moreover, focal patterns of neuropsychological deterioration fall into
<br>
various subgroups. According to our hypothesis, DAT patients, who at the
<br>
onset of the disease mainly manifest memory disorders, also represent a
<br>
specific subgroup characterized by impaired cortically projecting
<br>
catecholaminergic pathways. In a 6-month randomized, double-blind,
<br>
cross-over study versus placebo we analysed the influence of L-deprenyl
<br>
on the verbal memory of 19 amnesic EO-DAT patients. Verbal memory was
<br>
assessed by means of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. The results
<br>
obtained show significantly better performances for L-deprenyl treated
<br>
patients in learning and long-term memory skills. We suggest that
<br>
L-deprenyl, through selective inhibition of MAO-B and by increasing the
<br>
activity of the catecholaminergic systems, positively influences
<br>
cognitive functions and behaviour founded on memory efficiency.
