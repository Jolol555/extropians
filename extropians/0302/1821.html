<em>&gt; Seriously, it is the indirect attack done through third parties in the form

of terrorism which worries us about Iraq. We created this Frankenstein

monster and now we must go kill it. 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>To which Samantha replied:
<br>
<p>&quot;There is no good proof to date that Iraq is behind terrorism to 
<br>
any significant extent. So that can't be a serious supported 
<br>
reason for the proposed action. The thing about terrorism is 
<br>
that it can come from most any corner with sufficient rage and 
<br>
suprisingly little financing. It doesn't require a Saddam. 
<br>
Getting rid of him will do nothing to decrease terrorism. Most 
<br>
likely it will increase it.&quot;
<br>
<p>And this assertion is based on what? Where are the massive Al Qaeda assaults 
<br>
that were supposed to follow Mullah Omar's ouster in Afghanistan? Where are 
<br>
all the thousands upon thousands of casualties the US was supposed to suffer 
<br>
in removing the Taliban? Where are all the thousands upon thousands of 
<br>
casualties that the US was supposed to suffer in the Gulf War? Where's the 
<br>
prosperity and better quality of life the Communists were supposed to bring 
<br>
to Vietnam? As usual you are practicing your typical fear mongering.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's just very sad that several thousand U.S. troops may die in house to 
</em><br>
house fighting in Baghdad, but that's what they signed up for. I'm certain an 
<br>
oil company CEO would say that to his confidantes as they watch on the news 
<br>
the bodybags come home. 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;It is more than just very sad. It is morally reprehensible in 
<br>
the extreme that we would waste the lives of those sworn to the 
<br>
defense of the US in a senseless and unjustified aggression of 
<br>
this kind. It is senseless that their lives would be wasted 
<br>
putting ourselves and the world more at risk and increasing the 
<br>
ill will towards us. This is NOT what they signed up to do.&quot;
<br>
<p>Obviously the leadership of the United States, the UK, Spain et al would 
<br>
differ on your notion of unjustified. But worse yet, as usual, your practice 
<br>
of moral relativism is absolutely ridiculous. I have never once heard you 
<br>
refer to &quot;Saddam's aggression&quot;, &quot;North Vietnamese aggression&quot;, or even 
<br>
&quot;Communist aggression&quot;. But, if there is any opportunity for you to paint the 
<br>
United States as the second- coming of the Soviets, you jump at it. Our men 
<br>
and women in the military also did not sign up for the cowering in the sand 
<br>
appeasement offered by Bush's predecessor in regard to the North Koreans, who 
<br>
now seem to be a more palatable target for many on the left. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think there MAY be very positive effects to the U.S. led toppling of 
</em><br>
Saddam's regime. When our forces have vanquished his large middle eastern 
<br>
nation and are occupying it, the entire region will once and for all see our 
<br>
now unrivaled power to crush our foes is to be dearly respected. Of course 
<br>
heavyhitters like Russia and China (even North Korea or &quot;ally&quot; Pakistan) are 
<br>
still off the list since we would be biting off more then we could chew. lol 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;So you believe that &quot;our unrivaled power to crush our foes&quot; is 
<br>
what will draw the Middle East into freedom and democracy? 
<br>
Really? Isn't it more likely to increasingly lead to the US and 
<br>
all it stands for being hated as the worst sort of tyranny? Are 
<br>
we reduced to &quot;we will crush you if you resist&quot;?&quot;
<br>
<p>Amazing. What brought Germany to freedom and democracy? What kept South Korea 
<br>
from falling into a Communist sponsored nightmare in 1950? What kept all of 
<br>
Europe from falling under the boot heel of Nazism? Oh, but I suppose our 
<br>
attempts to resist Nazi and Soviet imperialism have already made us &quot;the 
<br>
worst sort of tyranny.&quot; 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree with Mez that the real potential problem is China. They have all the 
</em><br>
raw materials to over the next several decades grow into a serious regional 
<br>
if not global bully. I just hope they prove better than that. 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;But I thought you just praised being a global bully above, at 
<br>
least when we do it. Apparently it is just fine and to be 
<br>
applauded that we aren't &quot;better than that&quot;.&quot;
<br>
<p>All hail the queen of moral relativism. Yet again, without batting an 
<br>
eyelash, Samantha directly compares the foreign policy record of the United 
<br>
States to a (would-be) expansionist Communist state. Her ridiculous cries of 
<br>
&quot;Resist us and we will crush you&quot; are insulting at best and sickening at 
<br>
worst. Yes, the US has a long history of slaughtering innocents, just like 
<br>
the Prague Spring and Hungary circa 1958. Just like the Cultural Revolution. 
<br>
Just like Pol Pot's genocide. Just like Ho Chi Minh's land reformâ€¦I know, all 
<br>
of these pale in comparison to the four people that were killed at Kent 
<br>
State. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Peace.&quot;
<br>
<p>Look what it did for Indochina.

<p><p>Mao Zedong: Why have the Americans not made a fuss about the fact that more 
<br>
than 100,000 Chinese troops help you building railways, roads and airports 
<br>
although they knew about it?
<br>
<p>Pham Van Dong: Of course, they are afraid.
<br>
<p>Mao Zedong: They should have made a fuss about it. Also, their estimate of 
<br>
the number of Chinese troops in Vietnam is less than the real number.&quot;
<br>
<p>September 23, 1968, conversation between PRC Chairman Mao Zedong and North 
<br>
Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong.

<br>
Indochina, 1964-1977, p. 86)

<br>
Communist Party Secretary Alexander Dubcek following Dubcek's attempted

reforms. Brezhnev would order an invasion of Czechoslovakia of 500,000

communist troops to crush dissent shortly after this conversation in August 
<br>
1968.
