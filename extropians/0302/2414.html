<p>Both matter; it's not an either-or situation. If you add some more weight to
<br>
the axe, it will cut further (but be harder to lift).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; To look on mass alone seems to be one of the positive feedback loops

<p>There are many values and countless variables to consider, but there is also
<br>
the question that Brian asked: does new technology like airbags and the
<br>
stuff BMW advertises increase your safety more than just getting a
<br>
bigger/heavier car? The answer is &quot;no, getting a very large car would lead
<br>
to a much *larger* safety increase&quot;. This doesn't mean that those
<br>
technologies aren't valuable; they are.
<br>
<p>It also doesn't imply that people should buy bigger cars, or that the U.S.
<br>
should raise or lower taxes on oil, or that I have any opinion on those
<br>
issues.

If, hypothetically, mass was the only factor and everybody found out, would
everybody start driving tanks? Only if people tried to maximize their safety
at the expense of all other values and acted rationally. If you want to
increase your safety right now, you should wear a helmet when you drive,
travel only on slow roads, etc.
Even if everyone gets heavier cars, it would still lead to fewer deaths. The
main reason is that cars often hit inanimate objects and mass is always a
positive factor in those cases. The most commonly struck object that causes
a fatality is a tree.
