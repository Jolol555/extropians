<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;One of the best treatments of this subject I’ve recently encountered 
<br>
is by a French scholar who teaches at the London School of Economics, 
<br>
Nicholas Guilhot; he delivered the study at the most recent plenary 
<br>
gathering of the French Political Science Association in Lille. What 
<br>
makes this paper, which a former student of mine sent from France, 
<br>
especially intriguing is that Guilhot is clearly on the Marxist Left 
<br>
and, moreover, apparently unfamiliar with my writings. Nonetheless, he 
<br>
arrives at identical conclusions about &quot;la matrice trotskiste&quot; that 
<br>
nurtured the neoconservative view of the American managerial state as an 
<br>
instrument of world revolution.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>The notion of &quot;permanent revolution&quot; drawn from Trotskyist ideology is 
<br>
given a new meaning by being linked to an expansive American public 
<br>
administration that tries to replicate itself throughout the world. And 
<br>
though neocons in the seventies and eighties turn fanatically 
<br>
anti-Communist, Guilhot recognizes that his subjects are &quot;anti-radical 
<br>
radicals,&quot; opposing the Communists for betraying the revolutionary vision.
<br>
<p>Alan Wald makes the observation that &quot;the anti-Stalinist Left moves to 
<br>
the right for social and not ideological reasons.&quot; What may be more 
<br>
accurate to say is that they appear to move to the right in response to 
<br>
improved social positions, especially after taking over policy positions 
<br>
in the Reagan administration from a WASP establishment gone bad in the 
<br>
teeth. But this ascent to power does not really signify that those who 
<br>
are ascending are on the right. It merely enables the ascending group to 
<br>
pull toward the managerial Left the American Right and Right Center, 
<br>
while concluding a compromise with corporate capitalists.
<br>
<p>In return for the support of an expanding welfare state, neocons would 
<br>
deal Big Business in, exactly the way the Fascists did with European 
<br>
capitalists, that is, conditionally. Thus neocons would defend 
<br>
&quot;democratic capitalism&quot; or a mixed economy, together with global 
<br>
democratic military crusades and the opening up of foreign markets as a 
<br>
method of global transformation. Guilhot notes that the neocon usage of 
<br>
&quot;modernization,&quot; since the popularization of the term by Lipset in the 
<br>
fifties, has meant positive revolutionary change. It is a bootlegged 
<br>
Marxist value judgment pretending to be a neutral descriptive term.&gt;&gt;
