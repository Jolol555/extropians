<p>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps tonight I'll dream of standing naked before my grade school class
<br>
with tears streaming down my cheeks as students taunt me with questions such
<br>
as: HOW, HOW, HOW, will you control jillions of durable, microscopic robots
<br>
that breed even faster than rabbits, if thousands of scientists, engineers,
<br>
computers, backup systems, and checks and balances can't even keep one big
<br>
stupid macro vehicle from becoming an expensive photogenic meteor?
<br>
Well, goodnight to you all. I'm sincerely sorry for your loss, however you
<br>
may feel it.
<br>
Russell Evermore&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Some thoughts in response to your question?
<br>
<p>1. The threat from nanotech (gray goo etc.) may emerge as a serious issue 
<br>
far, far, later then most of this list would like. This also means that the 
<br>
promise of nanotech to revolutionize the world have been overstated; much as 
<br>
promises of cheap nuclear power, and early human landings on Mars. Again, 
<br>
this magical realm of technology may emerge many decades later then expected, 
<br>
by the worthies here.
<br>
<p>2. I was reading a suggested reason for the disaster today. One possibility 
<br>
was the peeling of the &quot;thermal protective tiles&quot; on the left wing of the 
<br>
shuttle. My concern is that we are still using, from a materials-science 
<br>
point of view, nomex or nextel tiles. This is ridiculous (if true) and speaks 
<br>
poorly of the aerospace firms that have continued to maintain the shuttles. 
<br>
Glue-on thermal tiles are definitely not the way to go, especially if the 
<br>
article I just read is proven true. There are metal alloys that would add 
<br>
weight, but serve even better for heat resistance. We haven't even spoken 
<br>
about advanced concepts aerospace planes. These need to be focused on, and 
<br>
the teams that decide who builds what concept needs to be redone. 
<br>
<p>3. Visionary Physicist, Freeman Dyson (as opposed to other physicists who 
<br>
merely collect checks) notes that certain big projects supported by 
<br>
governments, tend to be projects where one cannot afford to fail. The Shuttle 
<br>
is but one of these, the dirigibles of the 1920's and 1930's were another. 
<br>
One of the reasons, Dyson gives for the triumph of the airplane over the 
<br>
dirigible is that planes were robust, and their technology advanced extremely 
<br>
rapidly, compared to the dirigible. Dyson would conclude (me thinks) that we 
<br>
need a space program that lends opportunity for lots of experimentation for 
<br>
getting safely to orbit and back. 
<br>
<p>We need something that is a more reliable workhorse. This Shuttle takes lives 
<br>
every time it fails. This is the kind of bull puckey we, as tax payers, 
<br>
should not have to abide.
