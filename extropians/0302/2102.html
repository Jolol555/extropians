<p>
If the initial plan I outlined seemed to imply some level of censorship I
<br>
must take the opportunity to clear that up now:  I intend no ideas or
<br>
messages to be censored only rated by the readers who in turn will be rated
<br>
themselves.  So freedom of speech would be a founding principle. There would
<br>
be other founding principles that would attempt to establish a fair and open
<br>
area for debate by establishing rights for all participants.
<br>
As you well know systems of ratings are already being carried out, in an
<br>
abridged format, in places like epinions, amazon, consumer reports and
<br>
pcmag.com amongst many many others.  Pcmag.com has a rudimentary forum
<br>
rating system that allows people to vote on individual messages. I think
<br>
that this property when combined with the ability for the community to rate
<br>
the reviewers and then to filter the information as they wish would be more
<br>
compelling.  In addition to ratings on reviewers it would be helpful to have
<br>
real time polling on the critical points of argument in a sidebar.  
<br>
If we throw Galileo into the mix we can imagine any number of scenarios.  At
<br>
first his idea might be ridiculed by the majority.*  Evidence would likely
<br>
come from both sides of the debate - Ptolemic scholars would site the fact
<br>
that their astronomical predictions tended to be more accurate than
<br>
Galileo's (which appears to be a well accepted fact in our modern academic
<br>
literature).  Galileans would argue that their combination of simplicity
<br>
(Occams razor) and predictive ability gave them the edge(at some point the
<br>
sun-center method would result in superior predictive ability as well).
<br>
Over time the two sides would battle it out on the field of memetic warfare
<br>
and new evidence/information would be integrated until a new state of
<br>
equilibrium was reached.  
<br>
I think this sort of system where meaning is determined democratically (w/
<br>
high speed interconnections and an effective automated collaborative
<br>
filtering structure in place) would result in more efficient decision making
<br>
for individuals and societies. 
<br>
Implementing such a system - at least in a rudimentary fashion is becoming
<br>
less and less expensive over time and I think something like this would
<br>
serve our group well for a number of reasons.  As far as I can tell it would
<br>
play in to our support for the merging democratic and technological systems.
<br>
It would give us a concrete goal as a group and would allow us to begin to
<br>
work constructively together instead of spending most of our time locked in
<br>
bitter argument.   
<br>
This project would also fulfill some of our early supporters visions of how
<br>
information will be processed in the future - see Chislenko on ACF -

<p>*(Remember too that Galileo, in his time, was severely censored - this
<br>
system wouldn't completely avoid censorship but it would hopefully allow
<br>
censored memes to have their day in the sun earlier if they were in fact
<br>
deserving of such an honor.)

Subject: Re: Time to ask yourself....
<br>
<p><p>In a message dated 2/4/2003 11:42:08 AM Central Standard Time, <a href="mailto:CCamp@omm.com?Subject=RE:%20Time%20to%20ask%20yourself....">CCamp@omm.com</a>
<br>
<p>writes:  How is this achievable? I have a couple of suggestions.  Most 
<br>
arguments have identifiable points of dispute.  These points should be 
<br>
identified and polls should be taken.  Polls can be easily made via yahoo or
<br>
<p>other sources.
<br>
<p>Chris,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds like an attractive idea that upon reflection is highly 
<br>
defective.  During the days when everyone thought the Earth was flat Galileo
<br>
<p>would have been voted down.  And, if he persisted I suppose he would have 
<br>
been censored and possibly even disciplined if he persisted further.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That illustrates why some prefer a republic to a democracy.  There
<br>
has 
<br>
to been guarantees for the minority.  Are you intending to give the majority
<br>
<p>the right
<br>
&nbsp;to do anything at all that they wish to the minority?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have saved Amara's latest contribution -- the one beginning, &quot;I 
<br>
don't see the disagreements here that way. In my view, 'hawks' and 'doves'
<br>
is 
<br>
a narrow view, which doesn't help anyone understand each other better
<br>
because 
<br>
they are labels that pidgeon-hole someone and closes people's ears that
<br>
could 
<br>
be used for listening.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if her viewpoint or viewpoints had been censored by the vote of 
<br>
the majority?  She presented a view that I would never have imagined she had
<br>
<p>and frankly I would have been diminished by not having the privilege of 
<br>
reading what she has just written.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the term to apply to the present situation is that it is 
<br>
some form of a dialectic.  We argue it is true but we also inform and out of
<br>
<p>the complex circumstances of our discussions I believe we grow and learn.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As those that feel timid in presenting their case.  Well, in that
<br>
case 
<br>
I can only speak for myself.  But I am reminded of Carl Sandburg's old
<br>
story. 
<br>
&nbsp;Mr. Sandburg was very active at one time in the politics of the Democrat 
<br>
Party.  He saw a friend carrying a club and asked his friend where he was 
<br>
going.  His friend answered that he was on his way to a Democrat unity 
<br>
meeting.  That is not verbatim but close -- I think.  So, speak up, we
<br>
aren't 
<br>
nearly that bad.  &lt;G&gt;
<br>
