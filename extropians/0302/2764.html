On Sat, 15 Feb 2003, Technotranscendence (Daniel) forwarded this
<br>
piece from Starship_Forum, I'm responding to both groups.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Dennis May <a href="mailto:determinism@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20One%20solution%20to%20the%20Fermi%20Paradox">determinism@hotmail.com</a> wrote (to Starship_Forum):
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Weapons of mass destruction change everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In space, the scale of mass destruction grows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without bound.
</em><br>
<p>No it doesn't.  There are &quot;effective&quot; limits on everything.
<br>
Even the most energetic events in space such as stellar
<br>
collisions or gamma ray bursts have effective ranges.
<br>
If they didn't we would have been wiped out long ago.
<br>
See the Nov. 2002 issue of Scientific American, the
<br>
article &quot;When Stars Collide&quot; for further discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In space, the family truckster could be a kinetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy WoMD by its very nature.  The power plant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to run farms could  be a dual use producer of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fissionable materials for atomic weapons.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand where you are obtaining the energy from.
<br>
It sounds like you are planning on breeding elements lighter
<br>
than uranium into uranium or other higher MW elements that
<br>
are capable of fission.  The most readily available power
<br>
sources for this are light energy from a star (fusion) and
<br>
local fusion reactors.  This seems like it will be a very
<br>
inefficient process.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Mining equipment could steer a large rock down a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravitational well and destroy whole civilizations.
</em><br>
<p>Not any &quot;intelligent&quot; civilization.  An intelligent
<br>
civilization where individuals seek to live indefinitely
<br>
has to adopt a form of a distributed replicated intelligence.
<br>
(I pointed this out at the Extro 3 conference in 1997).
<br>
This thought vector subsequently led to the design civilizations
<br>
spanning solar system sized scales (e.g. Matrioshka Brains).  The
<br>
size limits for Matrioshka Brain civilizations powered by sol type
<br>
(G) stars are around 3 light years in diameter.  Hurling an
<br>
asteroid or a comet at such a civilization isn't going dent
<br>
its capacities even slightly, though it might annoy it
<br>
(which is probably *not* a good idea).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How can space tyrants disarm a populace when dual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use includes WoMD capabilities?
</em><br>
<p>This is still thinking too much along the lines of
<br>
primitive human space travel.  Things are quite
<br>
different when one takes ones entire star system
<br>
on the journey.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The next question is how to defend against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals and terror groups wielding these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same common industrial WoMD.
</em><br>
<p>Easy -- distributed, replicated intelligence.  The actions
<br>
of individuals or terror groups is pointless if they cannot
<br>
destroy &quot;all&quot; of you.  All they do by injuring part of you
<br>
is annoy you.  And as Khan observed, &quot;Revenge is a dish
<br>
best served cold&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Space societies, including Earth bound societies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have to adapt to these changes or be wiped out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WoMD are getting cheaper and cheaper.  With an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasingly wealthy society their cost will become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trivial and the knowledge of WoMD common.
</em><br>
<p>The WoMD paths do not (to a large extent) drive this.
<br>
The natural hazard function (sooner or later you will
<br>
be in the wrong place at the wrong time) drives it.
<br>
If you expect to extend your longevity to stellar
<br>
time scales you simply have to become a distributed
<br>
replicated intelligence.  (The only alternate path
<br>
that might be feasible is for an individual/civilization
<br>
to leave for intergalactic space where the hazard function
<br>
may be much lower.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It has to change the arrangement of human societies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aliens will have the same problem - hence my solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Fermi Paradox - only those who hide live in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the long run.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps true &quot;in the long run&quot;.  But the universe has
<br>
not reached the point where there are resource shortages
<br>
that would tend to promote interstellar warfare.  For now
<br>
there are lots of resources to supply the development of
<br>
multiple advanced civilizations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; SETI's theory is to look for local loud-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mouths living contrary to this military model.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might eventually find a loudmouth, an accidental signal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a lure designed to expose other civilizations.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should expect these to be rare give the implications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of WoMD.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;implications of WoMD&quot; have little or nothing to do
<br>
with whether civilizations &quot;announce&quot; themselves to their
<br>
local region of space or their galaxy.  All but the most
<br>
advanced civilizations must generate heat at detectable
<br>
levels.  Any civilization with advanced observational
<br>
capabilities will know where you are and what your
<br>
development (energy) level is unless you choose to
<br>
live within a dust cloud.  That will significantly
<br>
limit your ability to view other civilizations and
<br>
send out moderately high speed interstellar probes.
<br>
<p>Advanced civilizations care little about our current WoMD.
<br>
They do care about nearby star collisions or GRB and neutron
<br>
stars or black holes being hurled in their direction.  But
<br>
such events require a lot of planning and energy and can
<br>
probably be avoided by a civilization which is relatively
<br>
alert.
