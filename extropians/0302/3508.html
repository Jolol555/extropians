<p>Ethnic killings hit PNG
<br>
By Mary-Louise O'Callaghan, South Pacific correspondent
<br>
25feb03
<br>
<p>SEVEN people are dead and more than 20 houses have been destroyed in Port
<br>
Moresby during weekend clashes between rival Papua New Guinea ethnic groups.
<br>
<p>The deaths are the latest in a series of violent incidents to have beset the
<br>
capital since the country's economic downturn sharpened ethnic tensions.
<br>
<p>PNG has more than 700 different language groups, with many still practising
<br>
tribal warfare and the tradition of &quot;payback&quot; or revenge killings.
<br>
<p>At least three of the men killed at the weekend were chopped to death in one
<br>
of the town's more notorious outskirt squatter settlements, Nine Mile,
<br>
populated by people from the Central Province Goilala language group.
<br>
<p>The incident occurred when relatives of a Southern Highlands businessman,
<br>
who was killed after a dispute with people from Goilala the previous
<br>
evening, allegedly rampaged through the settlement, slashing the three men
<br>
and pulling down housing and shelters.
<br>
<p>Port Moresby police chief Geoffrey Vaki said he wanted &quot;instigators and
<br>
escalators&quot; of ethnic clashes to be dealt with harshly.
<br>
<p>&quot;I will not tolerate ethnic trouble here,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Not a weekend goes by without some sort of tribal clashes. It makes the
<br>
call for repatriation of people to their home (provinces) more credible,&quot; he
<br>
said in a reference to calls by PNG politicians for the repatriation of all
<br>
settlement dwellers from the capital.
<br>
<p>[etc]
