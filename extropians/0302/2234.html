<p>The turboDiesel has a promising future, but it has
<br>
never been a very practical roadcar option because
<br>
it has a funny shaped torque/RPM curve.  Diesels are
<br>
extremely peaky engines.  A gasoline motor has a lot
<br>
flatter and broader torque curve.  We say a Diesel
<br>
has 150 hp, but only when spinning at exactly 6820 RPM,
<br>
which is faster than one ordinarily spins an engine
<br>
on the street.  The Diesel rabbits actually had fairly
<br>
good peak horsepower, but they felt gutless when off
<br>
the cam, which is approximately always.
<br>
<p>If we had about a 700cc 25 kw (~35hp) turboDiesel
<br>
in a true series hybrid, we would have a very practical
<br>
economy car, acceleration almost so-so, capable of
<br>
120 kph indefinitely and would get twice the mileage
<br>
of current subcompacts.
<br>
<p>In 30 years, I expect racer-boy fun cars will burn
<br>
alcohol in a traditional internal-combustion-only
<br>
arrangement, with the other 80% of the proletariat
<br>
driving series hybrids with a boosted Diesel IC. spike
