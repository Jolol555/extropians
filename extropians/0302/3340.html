Hi
<br>
<p>Alex and Reason gave some excellent advice on backups, full antivirus
<br>
scans and installing a good firewall. (The XP built-in firewall is not
<br>
good enough).
<br>
<p>There are Trojan programs which can install a keyboard logger, which are
<br>
delivered via email and require you to click to run an attached file.
<br>
You should NEVER click on an attached file sent to you - even when they
<br>
appear to come from trusted friends. Save the attached file to disk
<br>
first and scan it with every security program you've got. Firstly, it
<br>
may only be pretending to come from a friend, and secondly, your friend
<br>
may have got a virus which is emailing itself out to everyone in his
<br>
address book.
<br>
But McAfee antivirus should detect them anyway (assuming you keep it
<br>
up-to-date!). You can always try different virus scanners for extra
<br>
security.
<br>
<a href="http://www.pandasoftware.com/activescan/">http://www.pandasoftware.com/activescan/</a>
<br>
<a href="http://housecall.antivirus.com/housecall/start_corp.asp">http://housecall.antivirus.com/housecall/start_corp.asp</a>
<br>
will both do a free on-line virus scan for you.
<br>
You may have to disable McAfee while competitive virus scanners are
<br>
running.
<br>
<p>One or two Anti-Trojan scanners are a good idea as well.
<br>
Try: <a href="http://www.anti-trojan.net/en/">http://www.anti-trojan.net/en/</a>
<br>
<p>Spycop is recommended if you suspect keyboard logging software has been
<br>
installed. Quote:
<br>
'SpyCop is the recognized leader in spyware removal and spyware
<br>
detection. It protects you against threats from spy software, covert
<br>
computer surveillance programs and network monitoring software. SpyCop
<br>
is similar to a virus scanner, except it searches for and tracks down
<br>
computer monitoring spy programs. Once downloaded and installed on your
<br>
PC, SpyCop can be used to scan your entire system for the presence of
<br>
any of the known computer monitoring spy programs available.'
<br>
<p>But people need physical access to your computer to install a keyboard
<br>
logging package, so if you find one installed then you've got serious
<br>
security problems. If they can install programs like that, they can
<br>
install anything else they want, copy any files in your computer or even
<br>
copy your whole hard disk. In this case you should assume everything in
<br>
your PC has been compromised.
<br>
<p>Best wishes, BillK
