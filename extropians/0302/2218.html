<p>Very true! If Americans were paying around 5 USD/gallon I am sure it
<br>
would concentrate your mind wonderfully on fuel economy.
<br>
<p>I think the reasons for the high tax in Europe compared with USA are
<br>
probably historical. USA had (have?) their own oilfields and started off
<br>
with cheap oil and long distances to travel. Europe has to import all
<br>
their oil and have shorter distances to travel. Europe has a much higher
<br>
population density and now has too many cars for comfort. Part of the
<br>
high taxes is to try to limit the growth in car numbers and part to try
<br>
to reduce the use of oil. Many towns are banning cars from town centres
<br>
or charging entrance fees to drive into town centres. And don't get me
<br>
started on the high parking charges in town!
<br>
<p>Greg mentioned that he sees lots of small fuel efficient cars in USA. I
<br>
think that this is a relative statement. Compared to his 'vette, then
<br>
yes, he probably does see a lot of more fuel-efficient cars. ;-)
<br>
According to the US Dept of Energy figures you have to drop down to
<br>
around 30 to 35 mpg average before you get a wide selection of cars
<br>
available in USA (apart from diesels). In Europe these qualify as large
<br>
family saloons, not fuel efficient cars at all.
<br>
Search in <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/">http://www.fueleconomy.gov/</a> from the US Dept. of Energy.
<br>
<p>Their figures for a 5.7 Litre 'vette are 19 mpg city and 28 mpg fway.
<br>
<p>But remember, Europe is not all small cars. Rolls Royce, Ferrari,
<br>
Jaguar, Mercedes, and other large cars are all plentiful. You just have
<br>
to spend lots of money on them. It's a lifestyle choice thing. If you
<br>
have the money you spend it on what you want.
<br>
