New DNA Computer Functions sans Fuel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
In 2001, scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel announced 
<br>
that they had manufactured a computer so small that a single drop of water 
<br>
would hold a trillion of the machines. The devices used DNA and enzymes as 
<br>
their software and hardware and could collectively perform a billion 
<br>
transitions each second. Now the same team, led by Ehud Shapiro, has 
<br>
announced a novel model of its biomolecular machine that no longer requires 
<br>
an external energy source and performs 50 times faster than its predecessor 
<br>
did.
<br>
<p>The Guinness Book of World Records has crowned it the world's smallest 
<br>
biological computing device. Many designs for minuscule computers aimed at 
<br>
harnessing the massive storage capacity of DNA have been proposed over the 
<br>
years. Earlier schemes have relied on a molecule known as ATP, which is a 
<br>
common source of energy for cellular reactions, as a fuel source. But in the 
<br>
new set up, a DNA molecule provides both the initial data and sufficient 
<br>
energy to complete the computation. Shapiro and his colleagues describe their 
<br>
DNA computer in a report published online this week by the Proceedings of the 
<br>
National Academy of Sciences.
<br>
<p>Both models of the molecular computer are so-called automatons. Given an 
<br>
input string comprised of two different states, an automaton uses 
<br>
predetermined rules to arrive at an output value that answers a particular 
<br>
question. For example, it can determine whether a string containing only a's 
<br>
and b's has an even number of a's, or if all the b's are preceded by a's. In 
<br>
the latest design, two DNA molecules bond together to perform the 
<br>
computational steps. An enzyme known as FokI acts as the computer's hardware 
<br>
by cleaving a piece of the input molecule and releasing the energy stored in 
<br>
the bonds. This heat energy then powers the next computation.
