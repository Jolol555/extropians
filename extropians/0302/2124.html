<p><p><em>&gt; I refer to the Argonne Labs IFR.  They had proof of concept reactors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running when my favorite Pres shut 'em down.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not saying it would violate the laws of physics but I don't see how it
<br>
could come close to being economically competitive.  I don't know what
<br>
reactors you are referring to but I'd be willing to bet they were a lot less
<br>
impressive than what you were talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Pu is good stuff - it fissions and makes lots of juicy heat, just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U...as long as it's sealed in the containment, who cares?
</em><br>
<p>A Uranium reactor might melt down but it could never explode like a bomb, a
<br>
Plutonium reactor could. Everything happens much faster with Plutonium too
<br>
and you have much less time to set things right when the reactor starts to
<br>
act odd, and at one time or another all reactors act odd. I don't think
<br>
Plutonium is good stuff at all.
