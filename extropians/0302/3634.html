<p>Yes I'm sure. There is no possibility that everyone will accept Holbrookes
<br>
spin or anyone elses spin for that matter, either from the US side or from
<br>
the
<br>
French side. Intelligence is not monopolized by any nation and there are
<br>
plenty
<br>
of capable minds (even if they are a small percentage of the total
<br>
population)
<br>
who are able to see through spin and recognize the truth that is written in
<br>
signed documents of the importance of the Charter and of 1441.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any ideas about how the Security Council might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be redesigned more rationally?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With nuclear proliferation looking inevitable--after all it *is*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1940's technology--the old structure looks bound to collapse, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no idea how to replace it.
</em><br>
<p>If the old structure means the current members of the Security Council
<br>
who are permanents remain permanents and some further incremental
<br>
changes are made to the non permanent members I cannot agree that
<br>
the &quot;old structure&quot; is bound to collapse. It might collapse but it is not
<br>
bound too.Whether or not it does depends first on the competence and
<br>
statesmanship of George W Bush and second on the statesmanship of
<br>
Jacques Chirac. Bush must make the overture or be judged by history
<br>
to have failed to do so. Chirac must respond when the overture is made
<br>
or the same consequence applies.
<br>
<p>If I had to accept a small but workable number of countries onto a
<br>
hypothetical security council that had the need to be both operationally
<br>
effective in the world and to represent a wide variety of interests and then
<br>
I found by some random chance that the permanent members that I just
<br>
happened to have to work with were the USA, the UK, France, China
<br>
and the Russian Federation then I would be astounded that I was so
<br>
lucky as to get these five. Certainly a case could be made for other
<br>
countries being as good as these but that is not the point. Other countries
<br>
can still play a role. What is the point is that it would be very hard to
<br>
produce a new Security Council in a new UN from the ruins of this one
<br>
that would actually be better in its composition that that which already
<br>
happens to be there.
