From: Lee Corbin [mailto:<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20Egypt%20(was:%20Bush%20budget%20has%200%20dollars%20for%20afghanistan)">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; But tell us more about Egypt.  Have you read Hernando
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DeSoto's book &quot;The Mystery of Capitalism&quot;?  He tries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to explain the poverty of Egypt, even given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peace and support over the past decades.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't read that book, but I can give you my own assessment of why
<br>
Egypt has not prospered.
<br>
<p>Some of it boils down to history.  In the 1950s, after Egypt won
<br>
independence from Great Britain, it aligned itself with the Soviet
<br>
Union.  In so doing it chose a model with a centrally controlled
<br>
economy, a large bureaucracy, and little in the way of civil
<br>
liberties.  By the early 70s Egypt and the Soviet Union parted ways
<br>
and in the late 70s the Camp David Accords with Israel brought quite a
<br>
bit of US good will.  However, the US in no way insisted that Egypt
<br>
change its domestic policies. As a result, Egypt is still largely a
<br>
soviet-block style society.  That, more than anything, has stunted its
<br>
growth.
<br>
<p>So the present situation in Egypt is:
<br>
<p>1) It has a mostly centrally controlled economy that is very slowly
<br>
decentralizing.
<br>
<p>2) It has a large and extremely corrupt bureaucracy.  Anything you
<br>
want to do in Egypt requires bribing someone.  You bribe the tax
<br>
inspector to reduce your taxes.  You bribe a city official to get a
<br>
building permit.  If you're a drug company, you bribe the minister of
<br>
health to get your drug approved in egypt.   
<br>
<p>3) There is no free press in Egypt.  The main newspaper is owned by
<br>
the president's son.  (Funny, that's how it is in Iraq as well.)
<br>
Every newspaper is told what to say by the government.  Criticizing
<br>
the president or the government is a crime.  
<br>
<p>4) There are no free elections in Egypt.  Every Egyptian &quot;president&quot;
<br>
has served until death.  The Egyptian constitution (hah) limits
<br>
presidents to two 5 year terms, but it has simply been ignored.
<br>
<p>5) The educational system in egypt has collapsed.  Elementary school
<br>
is now about 3 hours a day, in classrooms with more than a hundred
<br>
students per teacher.
<br>
<p>Most Egyptians are extremely cynical about their government.  They
<br>
know that it's dishonest, so they see no reason to be honest with it.
<br>
Stealing is very much taboo in egypt, but cheating on your taxes or
<br>
stealing from the government at any moment are considered just fine.
<br>
One of my relatives commented a couple months ago that he didn't know
<br>
a single person in egypt who didn't cheat on his taxes.
<br>
<p>The US provides $3B in direct aid to egypt.  That's second only to
<br>
Israel.  It's also around a quarter of the hard currency that flows
<br>
into egypt each year.  Yet the US applies little or no pressure to
<br>
open up the press, hold elections, crack down on corruption, or reform
<br>
the educational system.  
<br>
<p>I could go on, but it's rather disheartening.  The hardest thing is
<br>
talking to Egyptians about their country.  They know how screwed up it
<br>
is.  They have very little hope for things to get better anytime soon.
<br>
As I've said, I think hopelessness into the hands of fundamentalists
<br>
and terrorists.  If you want to encourage people to contribute to the
<br>
world, you need to provide them avenues via which to do so.
