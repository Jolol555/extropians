<p>The problem here is of course that it is impossible to determine what 
<br>
could be used. Maybe it will stop the paper describing that compound X 
<br>
(made by mixing dishwash detergents and cinnamon) is super-toxic, but 
<br>
what about the paper on the theoretical possibility of making 
<br>
macroscopic black holes if very theoretical conditions are true? Years 
<br>
later it is discovered that the conditions are true, and suddenly people 
<br>
can brew black holes. Should the report that the conditions be stopped? 
<br>
And what if nobody makes the connection until after the paper is out?
<br>
<p>There is also a more practical problem. Have terrorists to look at
<br>
scientific journals for terror ideas? I had a bull session yesterday
<br>
with a few friends, and we rapidly (~10 min) came up with at least four
<br>
realistic schemes to cause massive destruction/death in our home town,
<br>
some requiring extremely simple means. There is no *need* for censoring
<br>
scientific journals, since it is enough to know a bit about engineering
<br>
and the local infrastructure to do untold damage. Even if the results of
<br>
a research paper could produce tremendous damage, terrorists can easily
<br>
pick from the lower branches of the tree of knowledge. If one is really
<br>
is serious about preventing terrorists from acquiring dangerous
<br>
information, one has to censor basic engineering courses or monitor all
<br>
people who have passed them. 
<br>
<p>Again it is a case of chilling effects: systems of censorship are built,
<br>
that won't really prevent terrorism but makes people refrain from
<br>
working in fields where they know they won't be able to publish freely. 
<br>
In the long run that will hurt attempts to develop protections from
<br>
bio-, info-, nano- and other weapons. We are already seeing it in the 
<br>
realm of computer security.
