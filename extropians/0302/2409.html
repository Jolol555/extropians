<em>&gt; &gt; I know absolutely nothing about cars...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You know all you need, for you go on to say:

<em>&gt; &gt; So I do what any Child of the Internet would do in this situation. I

<em>&gt; &gt; fuel filter is almost completely blocked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Swap in a new fuel filter, drive away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So why stop at Googling up the answer and telling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the mechanic? Fuel filters really are an eeeasy fix,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideal for those who never fiddle with any mechanical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;device more complicated than a cereal box.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Get back on google, find a diagram of that 95 Ford

<em>&gt;Escort,
</em><br>
<p>Better yet, get a copy of the service manual (or the Haynes 
<br>
manual).  You'll have at your fingertips anything you'd need to know about 
<br>
your vehicle.  And you'd be able to pass on nuggets of useful information 
<br>
back into the net.  &quot;You take some out of the pool, you give some back to 
<br>
the pool&quot;.  True, there's much rubbish out there.  But that's why you 
<br>
develop &quot;mind filters&quot; for it.
<br>
<p>Better yet, here is the link to the Haynes site <a href="http://www.haynes.co.uk">http://www.haynes.co.uk</a>
<br>
<p><p>As Children of the Internet we are all siblings, therefore.  Do you see 
<br>
that we are your brothers?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;order the filter online, get under that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hood and fix it your own self. You can do it. Swap
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out the air filter while you are under there. With
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Google you really don't need a mechanic for those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easy common car maintenance jobs.
</em><br>
<p>I'm with Spike on this one, and possibly (probably) because we are both 
<br>
motorcyclists.  You really do need to know this kind of stuff on two 
<br>
wheels.  And I've sent manys the exasperated post to forums berating riders 
<br>
for not putting their repair/mainenance experiences online.  Part lists, 
<br>
tool lists, step-by-step illustrations, hints &amp; tips etc.  This kind of 
<br>
thing makes these kinds of tasks so much easier.  The more of this stuff on 
<br>
the net, the more difficult it becomes to naught but understand that which 
<br>
you didn't.
<br>
<p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again;
<br>
<p>I see and I remember,
<br>
I hear and I forget,
<br>
I do and I understand
<br>
