Ramez Naam comments:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I am indeed referring to Onan &quot;spilling his seed&quot;.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't heard that interpretation before, though it makes a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of sense.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, it's not an *interpretation*, it's what's right there on the page:
<br>
<p>Genesis 38
<br>
<p>6 Judah got a wife named Tamar for his first-born, Er.  7 But Er, Judah's
<br>
first born, greatly offended the Lord; so the Lord took his life.  8 Then
<br>
Judah said to Onan, &quot;Unite with your brother's widow, in fulfillment of your
<br>
duty as brother-in-law, and thus preserve your brother's line.&quot;  9 Onan,
<br>
however, knew that the descendents would not be counted as his; so whenever
<br>
he had relations with his brother's widow, he wasted his seed on  the
<br>
ground, to avoid contributing offspring for his brother.  10 What he did
<br>
greatly offended the Lord, and the Lord took his life too.  11 Thereupon
<br>
Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, &quot;Stay as a widow in your father's
<br>
house until my son Shelah grows up&quot; - for he feared that Shelah also might
<br>
die like his brothers.  So Tamar went to live in her father's house.
<br>
<p>Incredibly, the loons who have this posted at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.godsplanforlife.org/Onan_account.htm">http://www.godsplanforlife.org/Onan_account.htm</a>
<br>
<p>simply ignore what's on the page and editorially head the extract thus:
<br>
<p>&lt; The culture of death will not be defeated until there is repentance from
<br>
contraception. &gt;
<br>
<p>Ah well. For the continuing inspirational adventures of Tamar, Shelah and
<br>
that godly and horny man Judah, I refer you to the biblical text.
