I said about reptilian territory defense:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;This is a very powerful ancient evolutionary  program. Difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;overcome.
</em><br>
<p>And John Clark asked back:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would you want to overcome it? Over the last 600 million years or so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever since brains were invented the algorithm has proved itself to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerable survival value.
</em><br>
<p>It certainly had. But in this much more complex world of today, with the
<br>
cortex luxury at your free disposal, the reptile answer - much armour,
<br>
little
<br>
brain - is not adequate anymore. A certain amount of this cognitive brain
<br>
extravagance has even migrated into the armour by now: the surgical
<br>
destruction intelligence of contemporary US weapons is very impressive. And
<br>
I ask myself: if the industry that builds these weapons is only half as
<br>
influential as the American Rifle Association (or whatever it is called)
<br>
they will try their best to see their weapons applied in a real war.
<br>
<p>These things develop their own momentum. Though Saddam can by no means pee
<br>
at any WASP snow white garden fence in Washington or even San Francisco, the
<br>
propaganda artists in DC concentrate all available information about wars of
<br>
the 20th century, Saddam's crimes and Islam terror groups in such a clever
<br>
way that makes all garden fence owners nod in agreement and send showers of
<br>
fear through their reptile brains. So this powerful ancient program spins
<br>
off and makes you react stupidly and inappropriately and makes me wonder
<br>
what the cortex actually was made for.
