<p><em>&gt; &gt; Let's start with a dose of reality:  Just what significance has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; position of Poland etc. in the big picture?  [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What?  Are you saying that might makes right?
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  How do you get that notion?
<br>
<p>I'm merely pointing out that there are only two European countries
<br>
you have to take serious in the context of the Iraq conflict: Britain
<br>
and France.  Those have some non-negligible military reach, and
<br>
they have veto power in the Security Council.  They are the ones
<br>
for which a pro-war decision would inflict direct costs.  Everybody
<br>
else does just political posturing, which is cheap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So it's okay that Germany or England speak up, but not appropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the little guys?
</em><br>
<p>My reality check wasn't about speaking up but about whose voice
<br>
matters.  Britain and France are relevant here, at least if you go
<br>
the Security Council road, Spain and Germany as temporary members
<br>
rather less, and the rest of Europe is irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This really is a cultural divide between you and the Anglosphere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In some places, like Oz, giving the underdog a &quot;fair go&quot; is almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a national obsession.
</em><br>
<p>So I hope those places of the Anglosphere are cheering for Iraq in
<br>
the upcoming military conflict, where &quot;underdog&quot; is too favorable
<br>
a description for a country that in its present state could have
<br>
been blasted by any of the major combattants of WWII.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even in the U.S., there exists an egalitarian spirit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that seems foreign to what you say.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are totally misconstructing what I say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now if you or Chirac really blasted &quot;those idiots&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eastern Europe &quot;for wrecking the chances of peace&quot;, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any other thing you might say, that would be one thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But to attempt to intimidate and threaten them---well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we just shake our heads at that.
</em><br>
<p>Intimidate?  Threaten?  Chastising unruly children is more like it.
<br>
The message is that associating yourself with the USA to gain
<br>
political leverage against the EU when you are about to join it
<br>
will backfire badly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But thanks---it's becoming clearer that many Europeans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see power politics as more explicit (and less subtle)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than we do here.  The bullying can be upfront, instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of hidden.
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea where that conclusion comes from, especially since
<br>
it's just the opposite of the commonly held view.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As you may know if you follow European politics, there have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ongoing efforts for the last several years to forge a common European
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; foreign policy in order for Europe to be able to speak with a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and correspondingly more powerful voice.  The candidate countries--who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; after all have much to gain from EU membership--now seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sabotaging this effort, which is already painful enough as is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, then you TELL THEM THIS.  You TELL THEM THIS publicly, even.
</em><br>
<p>That's just what Chirac did.  The &quot;family&quot; thing and all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Indeed, for having plainly spoken their minds, those hopeful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entrants to the EU may have made a big mistake.  One does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not dare question La France publicly.  The very idea!
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense.
