<p>The figure of merit is not deaths per 100K population, but

rather fatalities per km driven.  The U.S. is a big country

get a high enough paying job afford the payments on that

home far from the city.

<p>Those nations such as Italy and Babylon, that were invented
<br>
before there were cars, are set up differently.  Ive seen
<br>
pictures of them, its truly amazing.  There are *homes* right
<br>
down *in* the city with all the businesses and stuff.  They
<br>
needn't drive far.  What a concept!

<p>People in Sweden drive more carefully because there is

ice on the road I suppose.

<p>I don't know why Portugal, but in Greece, perhaps
<br>
part of the problem may be those robes they wear
<br>
on the way to the colosseum interfere with braking.
