<p><em>&gt; Rafal, as far as I can tell you are not interested in fairly evaluating

</em><br>
<p>I'm going to offer to cut down the middle here (not having read any
<br>
previous exchanges) -- brain chemistry is *extremely* individual
<br>
specific due to the individual variations in receptor combinations.
<br>
Rather than hurling statements back and forth that selegiline does
<br>
or does not work I would much rather see comments on the exact
<br>
mechanism that selegiline is supposed to work from and an evaluation
<br>
as to when it might and might not work for individuals with specific
<br>
brain chemistry.
<br>
<p>The only way medicine and lifespan extension science is going to
<br>
make progress is to work its way out of the box that one size fits
<br>
all.  The best progress we might make is to acknowledge those situations
<br>
in which an individuals perspective may indeed be valid.  Should a
<br>
physician reject a treatment with which one in a million lives
<br>
might be saved?  Should a non-physician fail to acknowledge
<br>
that only one in a million lives might be saved (with no
<br>
evidence as to the facts from my personal perspective).
<br>
<p>I would urge both GTS and Rafal to take a step back and realize
<br>
that both of their perspectives might indeed be valid (mind you
<br>
I'm commenting without *any* literature review) and the real
<br>
question comes down to when their specific contextual perspectives
<br>
might be the better one to apply.  I don't know the answer to that
<br>
question -- but I think it is one worth a bit of study.
