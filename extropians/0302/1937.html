<em>&gt; &gt; NASA's been saying such a move would have been fruitless

<em>&gt; Hmm. Does ISS have a lock with doors big enough to pass a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pumpkin suit? Or would the idea be to de-press Columbia *and* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (part of) ISS for the necessary phases of the transfer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're the better student of the current configuration of ISS...
</em><br>
<p>There are 2 airlocks on ISS -- one US and one Russian.  The pumpkin
<br>
suits are smaller than either the US IMU suit or the Russian Orlan suit
<br>
and the airlocks are each designed to accommodate 2 astronauts suited
<br>
for EVA and a good deal of equipment.  In the emergency situation we're
<br>
talking about, the pumpkin suits would be good enough to hold pressure
<br>
for the transfer out the starboard side door of the shuttle.  Here's the
<br>
mission profile:
<br>
<p>-- Columbia comes alongside and is grappled by the station's arm (I
<br>
don't know, but assume Columbia didn't have its arm fitted for this
<br>
SpaceLab mission).
<br>
<p>-- Columbia's crew begins shuttle power-down for on-orbit mothballing of
<br>
indefinite duration.
<br>
<p>-- Columbia's crew suits up in the pumpkin suits and goes on Columbia's
<br>
suit-supply air.
<br>
<p>-- ISS arm maneuvers Columbia as close to the Quest airlock on ISS as
<br>
possible, with the starboard main shuttle door facing Quest.
<br>
<p>-- 2 from ISS exit the Quest airlock and rig as many lines as possible
<br>
around the passage between the two vehicles.
<br>
<p>-- Columbia depressurizes and the two from ISS cycle three Columbia crew
<br>
into Quest at a time (I'm sure it would hold three in pumpkin suits at a
<br>
tight fit).  Columbia crew stay on air supplied from Columbia until it's
<br>
their turn.  They're on suit air for max 20-30 minutes -- more like
<br>
10-20.
<br>
<p>-- After the third cycle, the 2 from ISS do a minimal close-down of
<br>
Columbia's hatch, photo the damage on the left wing if there's time on
<br>
the EVA, disconnect safety lines and ingress Quest.
<br>
<p>Total EVA time &lt; 4 hours.
<br>
<p>All assumes:
<br>
<p>1.  Sufficiently high-resolution pics of Columbia's left wing could have
<br>
been taken to diagnose the problem to make this kind of wild decision
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p>2.  Columbia has enough delta-v to rendezvous with ISS.  (Note ISS has
<br>
some minimal on-board delta-v, and could have contributed slightly to a
<br>
plane-matching manouver).
<br>
<p>Thereafter, Columbia's crew could be cycled down in Soyuzes over time,
<br>
with resupply of ISS stepped up for the duration with Progress flights.
<br>
<p>If Columbia couldn't be salvaged, then the SpaceLab module could have
<br>
been disconnected over time and incorporated into ISS, Columbia stripped
<br>
and &quot;scuttled&quot;.
<br>
<p>(An old salvage lawyer's mind at work, I guess ...)
