</em><br>
<p>This looks a bit like a sentiment I used to share. My view had
<br>
been - since when did it become the responsibility of the
<br>
accused to prove their innocence?R What great dangers lurked
<br>
for the world (and for US citizens themselves) if the Bush
<br>
administration (unelected but for Bush himself) and commanding
<br>
both the worlds most powerful military force and an extraordinary
<br>
capacity to put its own &quot;spin&quot; out through the media was to be 
<br>
permitted to appoint itself judge, jury and executioner and did 
<br>
not even seem to acknowledge that people in the free world
<br>
expected them to make their case?R Had the world forgotten
<br>
Nixon (that Presidential administrations could go off the rails?R)
<br>
Had Americans forgotten?R 
<br>
<p>Surely the greater threat, it seemed to me was the Bush 
<br>
administration's own approach. But something didn't make sense.
<br>
Why was it that Powell (who was more widely respected than
<br>
Bush) and even Hans Blix were also emphasising that it was up
<br>
to Iraq to prove it was cooperating and not up to the
<br>
investigators to find evidence of non-cooperation?R. This
<br>
looked to me to stand the normal burden of proof on its head. 
<br>
<p>Then I read Resolution 1441 which *all* members of the
<br>
Security Council (a body appointed to represent all Member
<br>
Nations of the UN) had agreed too. All includes France, 
<br>
Pakistan and Syria.
<br>
<p>(The UN link to 1441 is temperamental the US State Dept
<br>
holds a copy that is more likely to be reference at
<br>
<a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/topical/pol/terror/02110803.htm">http://usinfo.state.gov/topical/pol/terror/02110803.htm</a>. Its below
<br>
a page of State Dept. commentary.  )
<br>
<p>Resolution 1441 amounts to giving Saddam Hussein one last
<br>
chance after 12 years of non-compliance with UN Resolutions
<br>
and with the terms of the cease fire from the last Gulf War.
<br>
It needs to be understood in this particular context or it will
<br>
be misunderstood. I'm know because I misunderstood it. 
<br>
<p>I think the existence of Resolution 1441 with all 15 Security 
<br>
Council members supporting it has two important ramifications. 
<br>
<p>First, it is not just the United States that demanded that Iraq
<br>
disarm and to show that it had disarmed or that it would find
<br>
&nbsp;itself to be in &quot;material breach&quot; and face &quot;serious consequences&quot;
<br>
it was the entire Security Council, unanimously, back in November.
<br>
<p>Second, in my opinion, because the US and the 
<br>
UK two permanent Members of the Security Council also 
<br>
signed 1441, they, by that action, not only agreed &quot;to afford Iraq
<br>
by this resolution a final opportunity&quot; but they also implicitly agreed
<br>
that the decision as to what constitutes a &quot;material breach&quot; and as 
<br>
to what constitutes a &quot;serious consequence&quot; would be made by
<br>
the Security Council. Not just by the US or the US and the UK
<br>
together. 
<br>
<p>This in my opinion is an interesting detail because had the US not
<br>
taken the matter to the Security Council and signed off on 1441
<br>
then the US might have had grounds under Article 51 of the
<br>
UN Charter to take action against Iraq unilaterally (or with allies
<br>
in its own defence - using the circumstances of September 11
<br>
and the possibility of a nexus between terrorists and Iraq with 
<br>
WMD as grounds for an immediate response in the interests
<br>
of defending it citizens.) 
<br>
<p>(    <a href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html">http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html</a>
<br>
See Article 51 - Chap 7. ACTION WITH RESPECT TO
<br>
THREATS TO THE PEACE, BREACHES OF THE PEACE,
<br>
AND ACTS OF AGGRESSION    )
<br>
<p>However, having placed this matter in the hands of the Security
<br>
Council, and signed Resolution 1441 I do not see how the
<br>
United States (with the UK or any other nation that is a Member
<br>
of the UN and a signatory to the Charter) can now act on 
<br>
exactly the matter that the Security Council has before it without
<br>
Security Council assent without themselves breaching their
<br>
agreement with the UN as encapsulated in the Charter and 1441.
<br>
<p>In my opinion (which could be wrong) the US now  *needs*
<br>
a new resolution from the Security Council to at least release
<br>
it from it obligations under the Charter and 1441 or it will be
<br>
acting in breach of its these and will itself render the UN null
<br>
and void. This would not be a minor detail. This would be a
<br>
permanent Member of the Security Council (and quite possibly
<br>
two if the UK acted with it) breaching their agreements to the
<br>
UN. This breach would seem to render the UN Charter and 
<br>
the Security Council farcical. All international law (such as it is)
<br>
that derives from the UN would be undermined. Indeed international
<br>
laws which rely on the signatories of agreements to honour their
<br>
word would also be substantially undermined. 
<br>
<p>Some may argue it is already. But so far it is not farcical because
<br>
Permanent Security Council members (which the UN Charter
<br>
has no provision to expel or dismiss) are so far not acting in violation
<br>
of their agreements with the UN (and other Member Nations).
<br>
<p>So it seems to me the stakes are very high. The UN itself is in 
<br>
some real danger of being invalidated. The only justification that
<br>
the US and the UK could give for not honoring their agreement
<br>
to the UN would be that the UN had failed in its purpose and
<br>
had become irrelevant (this term sound familiar?R).
<br>
<p>The purpose of the UN as contained in Article 1 of the Charter
<br>
&nbsp;is &quot;to maintain international peace and *security*, and ...to take
<br>
&nbsp;*effective* collective measure for the prevention and removal
<br>
&nbsp;of threats to the peace&quot;). 
<br>
<p>(    <a href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html">http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html</a>
<br>
See Article 1 - Chap 1. PURPOSES AND PRINCIPLES )
<br>
<p>Civilization is a bootstrapping process. Bodies like the League of
<br>
Nations and the United Nations can indeed fail if they are not 
<br>
satisfying the practical purposes for which they were established.
<br>
They can of course also fail for a lack of good faith on the part of
<br>
their members.
<br>
<p>I think it is greatly to be hoped that the 50 plus year endeavour
<br>
that has been the United Nations does not fail and I think its worth 
<br>
recognizing that there are two ways in which it might fail in 
<br>
the present circumstances. A lack of will to take *effective* 
<br>
practical measures to maintain international security may be
<br>
grounds for failure (and each Member nation including and perhaps
<br>
especially the US must make this determination on the willingness
<br>
of other Security Council members for themselves to be willing to 
<br>
make hard decisions and to take effective means as each nation
<br>
has the responsible ultimately for the protection of its own citizens
<br>
as best it can). Poor faith on the part of some countries, again 
<br>
especially the US through the Bush administration acting too
<br>
precipitously might also wreck the UN.
<br>
<p>Personally I remain optimistic that the UN will not fail for 
<br>
either of these causes. I suspect a new resolution will be struck
<br>
that will at least allow the US and the UK with a &quot;coalition of 
<br>
the willing&quot; to take action without breaching their individual
<br>
Member obligations under the Charter and 1441. I hope my 
<br>
optimism does not prove to be misplaced. I suspect it won't
<br>
but I'd like to be surer.
