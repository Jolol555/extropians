<em>&gt; (Brett Paatsch &lt;<a href="mailto:paatschb@ocean.com.au?Subject=Re:%20artiificial%20poker%20player?%20%20(was.%20Re:%20Kasparov%20vs%20junior%20drawn)">paatschb@ocean.com.au</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One thing seems likely, though, the &quot;artificial player&quot; would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a pretty unreadable &quot;poker face&quot; and would hold up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well in the long sessions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyone know to what extend the mix is numbers and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory and to what extent its the capacity to read the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cues as opposed to the cards?
</em><br>
<p>In over-the-board play, reading people is definitely a skill
<br>
that makes a difference, especially at the high levels and at
<br>
no-limit play.  Just this Sunday I was watching the final
<br>
table of a no-limit Hold'em tournament at San Pablo (because
<br>
I had busted out of it earlier), and watched my friend Steve
<br>
Landrum make some fabulous reads: at about five players he
<br>
opened for a raise, a player moved all in, and he folded,
<br>
showing a pair of jacks--a huge hand in Hold'em.  Sure enough,
<br>
the other player showed kings.  At three players, he opened
<br>
with a raise, and an opponent pushed all-in with about 35% of
<br>
the chips on the table.  Steve called relatively quickly,
<br>
risking his own similar stack, with a pair of threes.  If his
<br>
opponent had any pair at all except deuces or threes, Steve
<br>
would have been more than a 4-to-1 underdog, but Steve was so
<br>
confident that he had no pair that he called, risking the
<br>
prize money difference of about $7000.  But this time he
<br>
called with his threes, and his opponent showed no pair, and
<br>
Steve went on to win.
<br>
<p>But that advantage is eliminated online, even for humans, and
<br>
pros still make money online.  Though it should be pointed out
<br>
that there are almost no no-limit games online.  Limit poker is
<br>
more a game of math than balls.  The two programs I mentioned
<br>
earlier only play limit poker.
