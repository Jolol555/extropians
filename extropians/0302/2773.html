Some people mentioned numbers in commentary on my reportage. If statistics have any context, it is interesting to note what the comparison would have been in the US with equal percentages.
<br>
<p>Number of Australians who died in Bali 80 [of 200] = x15 
<br>
equivalent in US terms 1,200 (compare World Trade Centre)
<br>
<p>Number of demonstrators in Melbourne (c. 200,000) = 4% of Victoria (5 million people) [other States like NSW have had their own demonstrations]
<br>
equivalent in US terms 12,000,000

<p><p><p><p><p>It's being dubbed the protest for the apolitical, the anti-war walk for those who usually don't wave banners, write letters to newspapers or lobby governments.
<br>
<p>Today at least 100,000 people are expected to gather in Hyde Park North to protest against Australia's involvement in a US strike against Iraq - and for some it will be their first protest.
<br>
<p>Liberals, trade unionists, religious leaders, professionals and university students will form an unusual alliance to send a clear message to Prime Minister John Howard: No war in Iraq.
<br>
<p>It will be the biggest rally in Sydney since up to 250,000 people walked across the Harbour Bridge in support of reconciliation and the biggest anti-war march since the Vietnam protests.
<br>
<p>Australians will be joining an estimated 10 million people in 600 cities today as part of global demonstrations against a war in Iraq. It is anticipated that the marches will be the largest ever for a single cause.&quot;]
