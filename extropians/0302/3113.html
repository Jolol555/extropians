</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  Or playing in a game in which his own cred is not worth much to
<br>
him.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) The lunatic fringe of the anti war movement is far crazier than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lunatic fringe of the pro war movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) It's counterintuitive but for some strange reason the war supporters seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like nicer people that the anti war crowd; that doesn't mean they're right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course.
</em><br>
<p>I think these things are a result of the views held, rather than the people that
<br>
hold them.  After all, it seems certain that there *will* be a war soon.
<br>
<p>A war supporter would believe that the world is going to be a safer
<br>
place shortly, and more stable.  If that weren't the case, they wouldn't, in
<br>
most
<br>
cases, be war supporters.  For those who are anti-war, however, the world
<br>
is quickly becoming a more dangerous place, and less stable.
<br>
<p>People who feel safer and in control are likely to act like nicer people than
<br>
those who think that things are getting worse and who fear the outcome of
<br>
likely events.  That shrill tone and those outrageous statements you hear
<br>
from the anti-war crowd are a symptom of fear, which follows quite closely
<br>
on having the view that the coming war will make things worse.
