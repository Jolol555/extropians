<em>&gt;The whole concept that you suggest, while having the advantage of
</em><br>
synergy of land use, begs the question of economic viability. What might
<br>
push a more, humble wind farm (non-hydrogenic) company, from emerging
<br>
profitability; into greater expense to move in a geothermal well, or a
<br>
photovoltaic array, is questionable. It might kill profits and eliminate
<br>
the wind farm company. Even with clean energy, please do not forget that
<br>
money is the mantra
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't expect the first energy farm of this type to turn a profit as it
<br>
would be highly experimental just as the first wind farms were.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It should be government subsidized as part of an overall government
<br>
energy research grant.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
And you would probably design and model the whole thing on paper first
<br>
to see what level of savings various synergies could achieve.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You may want to build the whole thing anyway just so that you can study
<br>
the synergy involved and attempt to increase it while decreasing costs.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Commercial energy ventures could study the design and chose to implement
<br>
the pieces parts that are most economically feasible.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It should produce a more stable supply of energy since if the sun's
<br>
shining the wind may not be blowing.  The wind blows at night while
<br>
solar would return nothing at night.

Subject: Re: Hydrogen as SCAM?
<br>
<p><p>Gary Miller asks:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Couldn't these be built in the desert where the land has limited use
<br>
for anything else? 
<br>
Couldn't solar arrays be place between the wind mills to increase the
<br>
energy output per acre? 
<br>
Even geothermal could be colocated in the same area. 
<br>
All these forms of energy generation could use much of the same
<br>
infrastructure. 
<br>
Plants farther away on the power grid near plentiful water could
<br>
generate the hydrogen. 
<br>
Also isn't the oxygen produced as a byproduct by the process also useful
<br>
in other forms of energy production such as the incineration  of waste
<br>
at high temperature? 
<br>
Colocation of multiple forms of power generation should reduce the cost
<br>
of each! &gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>The whole concept that you suggest, while having the advantage of
<br>
synergy of land use, begs the question of economic viability. What might
<br>

<br>
