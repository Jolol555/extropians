<p><p>Physicist Designs Perfect Automotive Engine
<br>
<p>COLLEGE STATION, Wednesday, February 26, 2003 -- Marlan Scully, the Texas A&amp;M 
<br>
University professor who applied quantum physics to the automotive engine and 
<br>
came up with a design that emits laser beams instead of exhaust, has been 
<br>
tinkering under the hood again. This time, he's sized up the perfect engine 
<br>
-- and improved it.
<br>
<p>Scully, known as the &quot;Quantum Cowboy&quot; for his innovations in quantum physics 
<br>
and his Franklin Society prize-winning research into beef cattle production, 
<br>
has invented a theoretical design more efficient than the Carnot engine, 
<br>
which had stood for nearly two centuries as the standard for efficiency -- an 
<br>
engine so ideal it exists only in theory. 
<br>
<p>In an article published this month in Science, Scully reveals a design that 
<br>
extends it. Scully's design employs lasers, mirrors and a concept known as 
<br>
&quot;quantum coherence&quot; to drive a piston with less wasted energy than in the 
<br>
Carnot model. 
<br>
<p>In Scully's engine, a quantum heat bath supplies the power: beams of hot 
<br>
atoms produce radiation whose pressure drives a piston. Scully likens the 
<br>
atoms to coal and the radiation to steam that drove early railroad engines. 
<br>
<p>Scully, a member of the National Academy of Sciences who holds joint 
<br>
appointments in physics and electrical engineering, is world-renowned for his 
<br>
work. But even though he and his collaborators have improved the engine that 
<br>
had been considered perfect, Scully makes clear that they have not rewritten 
<br>
the laws of physics -- the second law of thermodynamics is not violated, he 
<br>
says, and perpetual motion is still a dream. 
<br>
<p>The new engine model follows Scully's recent invention of the &quot;quantum 
<br>
afterburner,&quot; designed to capture energy from a car's exhaust, thus improving 
<br>
the efficiency of a classical four-stroke engine. The quantum afterburner 
<br>
uses a process that drains heat from the heat-engine gases and converts it 
<br>
into laser light.
