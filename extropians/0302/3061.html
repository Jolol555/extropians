<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why isn't the US going to war with Iceland, immediately?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't  think that the doves [hawks?] on this list have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; provided any solid reasons for not going to war with Iceland.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And who is any of us to say what the terrible implications of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not going to war with Iceland might be?  Iceland says it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have any WMD, but is there proof? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This looks a bit like a sentiment I used to share.  My view had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been - since when did it become the responsibility of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accused to prove their innocence?  What great dangers lurked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the world (and for US citizens themselves) if the Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration (unelected but for Bush himself) and commanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both the worlds most powerful military force and an extraordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capacity to put its own &quot;spin&quot; out through the media was to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permitted to appoint itself judge, jury and executioner and did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not even seem to acknowledge that people in the free world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected them to make their case?  Had the world forgotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nixon (that Presidential administrations could go off the rails?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Had Americans forgotten?
</em><br>
<p>After giving an extremely good description of his former
<br>
beliefs, Brett testifies as to what changed his mind:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Surely the greater threat, it seemed to me was the Bush 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration's own approach. But something didn't make sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why was it that Powell (who was more widely respected than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush) and even Hans Blix were also emphasising that it was up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Iraq to prove it was cooperating and not up to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigators to find evidence of non-cooperation? This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looked to me to stand the normal burden of proof on its head. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then I read Resolution 1441 which *all* members of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Security Council (a body appointed to represent all Member
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nations of the UN) had agreed to...
</em><br>
<p>I will forego quoting the remainder of Brett's well-written post.
<br>
<p>The important point is that we have here an interesting case of
<br>
someone who changed his mind, and what caused him to do so.  I
<br>
can myself express confidence in Brett's narration because of
<br>
the intelligence and sincerity of numerous prior posts.
<br>
<p>Now, if someone from the other side will give an honest account
<br>
of how *their* mind was changed, it would be most interesting.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
