<em> &gt;(I'd still like to know why the last US-invasion was stopped so soon.
</em><br>
<p>Because in 1991 virtually nobody (including me) thought Saddam could remain
<br>
in power more than a few weeks, a month at most, after such a humiliating
<br>
military defeat. We were absolutely certain he would be deposed from within
<br>
and we were dead wrong.
