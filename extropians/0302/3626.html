Christian does that which I really hate, post only the

irrelevant part of a reply.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What?  Are you saying that might makes right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh?  How do you get that notion?
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you read YOUR ENTIRE PARAGRAPH, 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's start with a dose of reality:  Just what significance has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position of Poland etc. in the big picture?  These countries cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project military force; if any of them happen to be in the Security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Council they have no veto power; they do not have the financial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources to significantly contribute either to a war effort or to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rebuilding afterwards.  In short, their position is irrelevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in practice and only an expression of moral support and political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; association.
</em><br>
<p>Then my question, &quot;What? are you saying might makes right?&quot;
<br>
is sensible because you explain your position by referring
<br>
to the fact that these countries like Poland cannot project
<br>
military force.  And that they have no veto power.  So that
<br>
they are irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm merely pointing out that there are only two European countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have to take serious in the context of the Iraq conflict: Britain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and France.  Those have some non-negligible military reach, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have veto power in the Security Council.  They are the ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for which a pro-war decision would inflict direct costs.  Everybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else does just political posturing, which is cheap.
</em><br>
<p>So everyone else should not express an opinion?  As I
<br>
carefully explained, we appear to have a cultural gap
<br>
here.  Your point of view seems repugnant to some of
<br>
the rest of the people here (doubly so, I might suggest,
<br>
for the residents of those small &quot;less significant&quot;
<br>
countries).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My reality check wasn't about speaking up but about whose voice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters.  Britain and France are relevant here, at least if you go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Security Council road, Spain and Germany as temporary members
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather less, and the rest of Europe is irrelevant.
</em><br>
<p>That's a little bit better, but your earlier remarks 
<br>
definitely denigrate such &quot;posturing&quot;, as you call it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This really is a cultural divide between you and the Anglosphere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In some places, like Oz, giving the underdog a &quot;fair go&quot; is almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a national obsession.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I hope those places of the Anglosphere are cheering for Iraq in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the upcoming military conflict, where &quot;underdog&quot; is too favorable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a description for a country that in its present state could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been blasted by any of the major combatants of WWII.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, some of the more obsessive types seem completely 
<br>
incapable of rooting for the bigger guy, no matter now
<br>
evil the smaller guy is. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Even in the U.S., there exists an egalitarian spirit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that seems foreign to what you say.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you are totally misconstructing what I say.
</em><br>
<p>Oh yeah?  See the next section; I'm telling you that
<br>
there is some kind of psychological or cultural 
<br>
difference going on.  You next dismiss the countries
<br>
of Eastern Europe as &quot;unruly children&quot; (!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now if you or Chirac really blasted &quot;those idiots&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Eastern Europe &quot;for wrecking the chances of peace&quot;, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any other thing you might say, that would be one thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But to attempt to intimidate and threaten them---well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we just shake our heads at that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intimidate?  Threaten?  Chastising unruly children is more like it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The message is that associating yourself with the USA to gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political leverage against the EU when you are about to join it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will backfire badly.
</em><br>
<p>The arrogance of looking down one's long nose at the
<br>
&quot;unruliness&quot; of these incompetent children---who should
<br>
obey their superiors---is quite remarkable, and galling.
<br>
At least it would be in the Anglosphere, I submit.
<br>
Yes, La France will &quot;chastise&quot; these poor inferior types.
<br>
<p>I repeat: you make such warnings *in private* if you
<br>
don't want to be seen as extremely arrogant.  But then,
<br>
is there a word for arrogance in French?  Or does it merely
<br>
translate as &quot;acknowledgment of one's own strength&quot;?  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But thanks---it's becoming clearer that many Europeans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see power politics as more explicit (and less subtle)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than we do here.  The bullying can be upfront, instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of hidden.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no idea where that conclusion comes from, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since it's just the opposite of the commonly held view.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  Yes.  To you, it's invisible, I guess.  So telling
<br>
the smaller countries &quot;shut up, or else&quot;, is not bullying
<br>
to you?  Or what?  (Thanks for any insight you have, here.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; As you may know if you follow European politics, there have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ongoing efforts for the last several years to forge a common European
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; foreign policy in order for Europe to be able to speak with a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and correspondingly more powerful voice.  The candidate countries--who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; after all have much to gain from EU membership--now seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; sabotaging this effort, which is already painful enough as is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Okay, then you TELL THEM THIS.  You TELL THEM THIS publicly, even.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's just what Chirac did.  The &quot;family&quot; thing and all.
</em><br>
<p>No, he added the &quot;or else&quot;, didn't he?  It was *not* a high-minded
<br>
lecture on unity, as I recall, but a blunt warning.  Isn't that
<br>
so?
