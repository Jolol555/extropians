It goes like this.....
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>A traveller &quot;X&quot; wants to get to St Ives and arrives at a T intersection
<br>
(see Fig A. below) at which stand two &quot;custodians of the pass&quot;
<br>
&quot;O&quot; and &quot;O&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><p>(path 1)          &lt;-----------------------------&gt;     (path 2)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O      |      O
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(custodian C1)  |      (custodian C2)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X  (the traveller)
<br>
<p><p>(Fig. A.)
<br>
[How things *look* to traveller X approaching the T intersection
<br>
with two &quot;custodians&quot; and two possible paths. ]
<br>
<p><p>Traveller X has been reliable informed that the correct path
<br>
to St Ives can be taken by either turning left or turning right
<br>
but he has not been told which.
<br>
<p>Traveller X knows that one of the custodians of the pass
<br>
will always respond to questions with a lie and the other
<br>
will always respond with the truth. Both of these custodians
<br>
know each other well and both know the actual way to
<br>
St. Ives. T does not know which custodian is the liar and
<br>
which is the truth teller.
<br>
<p>He is permitted only one question to one of them to determine
<br>
the way to St Ives. But one question is enough.
<br>
<p><p>What is the question?.
<br>
<p>(answer at bottom of the post just in case anyone doesn't
<br>
know and wants to try and work it out themselves)
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>Fig B. Shows the truth that Traveller X can't &quot;see&quot;.
<br>
<p><p>(path 1 is ....                                              ( path 2 is....
<br>
the way to St. Ives)  &lt;---------- ---------&gt;  NOT the way)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O    |     O
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C1 always tells the truth)     |     (C2 always lies)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X
<br>
<p><p>Figure B.
<br>
-----------------
<br>
<p><p><p>[The answer:]
<br>
<p>Traveller X can ask either custodian &quot;which way would
<br>
he (the other custodian) have told me to go if I had
<br>
asked him the way to St Ives.
<br>
<p>Then Traveller X knows the way is the opposite.
<br>
<p>Traveller X still does not know if he spoke to the liar
<br>
or the truth teller and he doesn't care as he is already
<br>
on his way to St Ives.
<br>
<p>-----------
<br>
<p>Lee is quite reasonably sceptical about the use of the
<br>
term &quot;game theory&quot; in relation to the Iraqi crisis.
<br>
<p>I applaud that scepticism, and if I can explain my &quot;reasoning&quot;,
<br>
without losing too much time I'd like to give it a shot. In
<br>
some ways its easier to just give &quot;the answers&quot; and not &quot;the
<br>
method&quot;. The answers should be testable, and challengeable
<br>
themselves even if the method is not. (The first &quot;answer&quot; was
<br>
that Bush should approach Chirac and ask him to come
<br>
up with a standard of proof to be applied generally by the
<br>
Security Council in order to decide whether a particular
<br>
go-to-war decision was warranted. This answer has the
<br>
appeal of preserving the UN and affixing accountability for
<br>
failure and of making poor faith or poor judgement
<br>
apparent - I think).
<br>
<p>I don't know if the above problem is really about &quot;game
<br>
theory&quot; per se. But the phenomenon that is that problem and
<br>
Axelrods &quot;discovery&quot; that the principles of tit for tat are
<br>
teachable and once learnt constitute a strategy that cannot be
<br>
beaten in iterative prisoners games even by those who know
<br>
they are playing against it has certainly influenced my sense
<br>
that the current Iraq crisis and the &quot;standoff&quot; within the UN
<br>
is rationally resolvable despite human passions.
<br>
<p>I don't know that what I am actually doing is game theory with
<br>
capital letters. I think what I am doing is trying to come up with
<br>
a set of rules or a procedure which is guaranteed to give the best
<br>
possible outcome given certain facts and given that those facts
<br>
can be presented to free agents who have choice but who are
<br>
bounded to act in the social world in only finite and limited ways.
<br>
<p>Perhaps rather than game theory I am doing a sort of transaction
<br>
analysis.
<br>
<p>Maybe I'm just being a w**ker. But if so I am not being so
<br>
knowingly.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
