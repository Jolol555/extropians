&quot;Kai Becker&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:kmb@kai-m-becker.de?Subject=Re:%20IRAQ%20sort%20of:%20Re:%20Tim%20May%20calls%20for%20nuking%20of%20D.C.">kmb@kai-m-becker.de</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If WMD are ever used by Saddam or any other terrorist organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; against America I expect they will be shipped just like any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; package, by UPS or Federal Express.
</em><br>
<p><em>            &gt; And why should he be so stupid?
</em><br>
<p>Except for internal Iraqi politics Saddam has demonstrated he is very stupid
<br>
indeed, that's why he's so dangerous.
<br>
<p><em>      &gt;  It doesn't take 200,000 soldiers to maintain the pressure.
</em><br>
<p>200,000 soldiers would not be nearly enough if they did what you want and
<br>
made it clear that they would never be used. The threat of war is the only
<br>
thing that made Saddam let the inspectors back in and the longer they are
<br>
not used the more hollow that threat will seem to him. When that happens the
<br>
inspectors will be kicked out and we'll be right back where we started from.
<br>
<p><em>            &gt;The USA military bases in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Turkey were
</em><br>
<em>            &gt;able to ensure the no flight zones for twelve years now.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. So what?
<br>
<p><em>            &gt;How much more would it take to extend this zone across the
</em><br>
<em>            &gt;whole country and have daily practice with AWACS,
</em><br>
<em>            &gt;U2 and other systems?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know or care because that would never make Saddam disarm. Saddam
<br>
just LOVES his WMD, he has given up several hundred billion dollars in oil
<br>
revenue over the last decade to keep them and thinks it's worth it. I think
<br>
Saddam would rather die than give up his beloved WMD and some U2 flights
<br>
will not faze him in the slightest.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me:
<br>
<em>      &gt;&gt; Force? How?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Read my mail again:
</em><br>
<p>No need, I read it the first time and it's not like it was very deep and
<br>
needed study. Saddam is a evil man, to get him to do the right thing you are
<br>
going to have to force him and my question was how. I want specifics, what I
<br>
read from you was little more than wish for peace love and happiness.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Ah, okay. But those weapons have been destroyed, right?
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.
<br>
<p><em>            &gt;Do you have the hard facts that Mr. Powell failed to present?
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps it is a language problem, perhaps the words &quot;hard facts&quot; has some
<br>
strange meaning I am unaware of. The UN says the have something, Iraq admits
<br>
to having it, but I must supply &quot;hard facts&quot; that they have it. I'm
<br>
confused.
