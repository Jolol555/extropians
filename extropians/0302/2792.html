<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I suppose Darwinism is a good place to see if people really can 
<br>
be &quot;Fortean&quot;. Fort's entire point was that the alleged 
<br>
'certainty' of modern man about this, that and the other thing is 
<br>
just the result of people, lemming-like, putting their trust blindly 
<br>
in experts and adopting what are actually beliefs while thinking 
<br>
themselves above all that.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
He was truly a free thinker and skeptic in the true sense. All 
<br>
things were open to questioning. That's the real attitude of science 
<br>
that has brought us forward. But how often is it actually being 
<br>
practiced now? Instead dogmatism has taken over again.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I agree with all that you've said there. Forteana began with &quot;The 
<br>
Book of the Damned&quot;, but it's easy to overlook that central point of 
<br>
Fort's; to put it another way - that it's the dominant prevailing 
<br>
belief system that actually defines and damns - whatever undermines 
<br>
it's credibility.
<br>
<p>Anomolies are just facts that don't fit into the current belief 
<br>
system - so what other system could be devised where they wouldn't 
<br>
be considered anomolous?
<br>
<p>The first and most obvious answer that comes to mind is; ANY system 
<br>
that doesn't exclude the reality of some-sort-of God or spirit-
<br>
beings. 
<br>
<p>In other words, ANY culture anywhere in the world in any age - NOT 
<br>
based on the exclusionism of Darwinism - would not need to debate 
<br>
the very existence of phenomena such as poltergeists, apparitions, 
<br>
BVMs, EVP, John Edward, and &quot;contacts&quot; and mediums in general, 
<br>
ectoplasm, spirit photography, levitation, ouija boards and 
<br>
automatic writing, UFOs and abductions, Crop Circles, OBEs and NDEs, 
<br>
reincarnation, freaky coincidences, miraculous recoveries, SHC, 
<br>
precognition, prophecy; even alternate theories of psychology, 
<br>
emotion, hallucinations and schizophrenia, illness and health, the 
<br>
whole gamut.......could all be objectively studied to find out 
<br>
what's real and what isn't, how it's done and what it means, without 
<br>
the mechanistic assumptions that now limit knowledge.
<br>
<p>The list could be extended into &quot;natural&quot; areas that Darwinism has 
<br>
also &quot;damned&quot;, like &quot;blood rains&quot; and other things that fall from 
<br>
the sky, comets and their cargoes, asteroids, anomolies of the solar 
<br>
system and beyond, civilization-destroying world catastrophes, mixed 
<br>
fossil dinosaur and human footprints, out-of-place artifacts, 
<br>
cryptoids &amp; BCs, origins - of coal and oil, of life, species, man, 
<br>
rise and fall of empires and what happened to them, &quot;what it's all 
<br>
about&quot; in general...., which CAN all be sensibly related to one 
<br>
another in a universe NOT based on the evolutionary model.
<br>
<p>Quickly adding that, in reality, religion-based societies 
<br>
(especially the monotheistic) have been (are now, will be again?) 
<br>
the harshest and most intolerant despostisms of all - heretics need 
<br>
not apply.
<br>
<p>The Darwinian era has at least ALLOWED a &quot;golden age&quot; of Fortean 
<br>
research for those individuals with a taste for delving. It's up to 
<br>
each of us to work around whatever the system puts in the way and 
<br>
take account of the heretics too - even (from my perspective) 
<br>
Darwinists and atheists :-)
