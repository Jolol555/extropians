I understand what you are saying. My point is simply this: why are we doing
<br>
these messages on this email list. You may be able to sway peoples opinions,
<br>
big deal. Shouldn't we be much more worried about the truth? I get tired of
<br>
reading through emails that I can gain no information from. Isn't there some
<br>
type of qualification for an argument being moot when there is nothing it is
<br>
trying to prove? So we might as well cancel the argument out. Too bad it
<br>
couldn't cancel itself out like anti-matter matter does.
<br>
Brett thanks for the reply, Nate

<em>&gt; &gt; It is to the best of my knowlege that the decisions of the UN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and of each nation are still left up to a few people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mine too. At least a relative few.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  It is much more likely that the US choosing war or France
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; choosing  anti-war derives from irrational ideas of a  few people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think its so much the number of people deciding an issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that determines whether or not any decision is rational what seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be more important is the process by which they decide. Because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the UN is a &quot;club&quot; of Member nations who gets to sit in the General
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Assembly and on the Security Council on behalf of their particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;country will in very large part be effected by the processes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by which governments are formed (which in turn appoint their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;representatives) in any particular country. What I think we can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fairly confident of however is that those who are representing any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;country at the UN will be pretty capable in comparison to the run
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the mill member of their society when it comes to being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make and rebut arguments. Intelligence matters in all countries and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all countries have enough members to choose from to ensure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more rather than less intelligent representatives will represent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;governments of those countries at the UN.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then the media takes hold of the positions and propaganda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; flourishes. Before you know it you have two people arguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over wether France sold Iraq illegal weapons. To argue about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something when neither party in the argument can give accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information is futile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Its only futile if you assume the point of all arguments is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communicate or to find the truth. In political forums this is almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never the case. In political forums the point of argument is seldom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to persuade the person one is ostensibly arguing with the point is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to make some sort of impression on the far greater numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people listening in. In political forums it is more often numbers that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;count not the power of an arguement. A powerful argument is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of interest politically when it results in larger numbers of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agreeing with what you (or your government) want them to agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It would be like me trying to argue that two people on this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't know but I heard from this third person are idiots. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; argument is meaningless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Its only meaningless if you keep thinking in two dimensions as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an argument being basically about two adversaries engaged in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a search for the truth. If you think that the speakers are speaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the benefit of the audience then a lot more things will make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The truth is almost never the point in political discourse, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political discourse is concerned with creating an environment that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will facilitate a particular outcome and this usually takes numbers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In political discourse what matters is which &quot;truth&quot; gets to be talked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about. If you and I were to get into a public discussion about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;truth or falsehood of me being a rotten scoundrel then regardless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of whether I am a rotten scoundrel or not I would in most cases
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be performing poorly as a politcal operator to even be having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such an unhelpful discussion for me in front of an audience. If your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intention was to discredit me and you could entice me into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;serious discussion about whether or not I was a rotten scoundrel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then their would be a point to what you were doing and I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be obliging you by taking you up on your choice of topic rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than making another one of my own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The  first question of an argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should be &quot;what are we hoping to solve&quot; it he answer is nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than what's the point?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is true if both parties are seeking to discover shared truth. Alas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when you add an audience as in debates in front of an audience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or in all political exchanges it ceases to be entirely about that.
