The first time I came across it was on an old Doctor Who episode, but I'm
<br>
sure they lifted it from elsewhere. I don't know where, though.
<br>
<p>btw, you can also ask either guardian &quot;If I had come to see you yesterday,
<br>
and asked you the way to St Ives, what would you have told me?&quot;. Whatever
<br>
answer the guardian gives will be the correct way.

<em>&gt; Subject: Anyone know the source of this old teaser? (was Skepticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Game Theory (was IRAQ sort of...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It goes like this.....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A traveller &quot;X&quot; wants to get to St Ives and arrives at a T 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intersection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (see Fig A. below) at which stand two &quot;custodians of the pass&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;O&quot; and &quot;O&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (path 1)          &lt;-----------------------------&gt;     (path 2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                      O      |      O
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                      (custodian C1)  |      (custodian C2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                               |
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                               |
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                              X  (the traveller)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Fig. A.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [How things *look* to traveller X approaching the T intersection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with two &quot;custodians&quot; and two possible paths. ]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Traveller X has been reliable informed that the correct path
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to St Ives can be taken by either turning left or turning right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but he has not been told which.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Traveller X knows that one of the custodians of the pass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will always respond to questions with a lie and the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will always respond with the truth. Both of these custodians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know each other well and both know the actual way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; St. Ives. T does not know which custodian is the liar and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is the truth teller.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is permitted only one question to one of them to determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way to St Ives. But one question is enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is the question?.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (answer at bottom of the post just in case anyone doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know and wants to try and work it out themselves)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fig B. Shows the truth that Traveller X can't &quot;see&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (path 1 is ....                                              
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ( path 2 is....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way to St. Ives)  &lt;---------- ---------&gt;  NOT the way)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                         O    |     O
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    (C1 always tells the truth)     |     (C2 always lies)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                                |
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                               X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Figure B.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -----------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [The answer:]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Traveller X can ask either custodian &quot;which way would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he (the other custodian) have told me to go if I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asked him the way to St Ives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then Traveller X knows the way is the opposite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Traveller X still does not know if he spoke to the liar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the truth teller and he doesn't care as he is already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on his way to St Ives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -----------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee is quite reasonably sceptical about the use of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term &quot;game theory&quot; in relation to the Iraqi crisis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I applaud that scepticism, and if I can explain my &quot;reasoning&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without losing too much time I'd like to give it a shot. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some ways its easier to just give &quot;the answers&quot; and not &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method&quot;. The answers should be testable, and challengeable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves even if the method is not. (The first &quot;answer&quot; was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Bush should approach Chirac and ask him to come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with a standard of proof to be applied generally by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Security Council in order to decide whether a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go-to-war decision was warranted. This answer has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appeal of preserving the UN and affixing accountability for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failure and of making poor faith or poor judgement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent - I think).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know if the above problem is really about &quot;game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory&quot; per se. But the phenomenon that is that problem and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Axelrods &quot;discovery&quot; that the principles of tit for tat are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teachable and once learnt constitute a strategy that cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beaten in iterative prisoners games even by those who know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are playing against it has certainly influenced my sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the current Iraq crisis and the &quot;standoff&quot; within the UN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is rationally resolvable despite human passions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know that what I am actually doing is game theory with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capital letters. I think what I am doing is trying to come up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a set of rules or a procedure which is guaranteed to give the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible outcome given certain facts and given that those facts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be presented to free agents who have choice but who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bounded to act in the social world in only finite and limited ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps rather than game theory I am doing a sort of transaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe I'm just being a w**ker. But if so I am not being so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowingly.
</em><br>
