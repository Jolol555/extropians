<p><em>&gt; &gt;When one wonders about &quot;reputable&quot; theories versus &quot;fringe&quot; theories, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;helps to consider the current STRENGTH of the consensus that modern science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;has on a given topic.  At the moment, the Big Bang theory is THE theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the evolution of the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's because it's now so strongly supported by evidence, that not to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe it would be perverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Untrue. Lets just take ONE recent discovery that contradicts the standard 
<br>
theory: Dark Energy expansion of the universe.  According to the 'standard' 
<br>
big bang theory, it shouldn't exist.  As far as anyone can model, to be 
<br>
consistent with the big bang theory, you have to assume that the repulsive 
<br>
effect of dark energy was initially very small and has only recently (the 
<br>
last billion years or so) started to cause accellerating expansion.
<br>
<p>Sure, there are ways to reconcile this with the old theory, but that just 
<br>
creates a new theory which is still incompatible with some dozen or other 
<br>
observations I can pull out.
<br>
<p>Now, AGAIN, I will reiterate that this DOES NOT MEAN that all of the fringe 
<br>
theories are automatically correct. It means (deep breath) WE DO NOT 
<br>
CURRENTLY HAVE A THEORY OF THE CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE WHICH IS CONSISTENT 
<br>
WITH *ALL* CURRENT OBSERVATIONS.	 That, pure and simple, is my point, and the 
<br>
fact that it makes some folks uncomforatable, bothers me not one bit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It isn't wrong and it isn't fatally flawed. What's fatally flawed are all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the alternative theories, which have now all been falsified by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observational evidence of the past several years.
</em><br>
<p>Bullpoop. Most alternative theories are so crackpot that they could never be 
<br>
tested, never mind falsified. Of those which DO sucessfully account for some 
<br>
of the observations which the big bang fails to account for, I know of none 
<br>
which successfully accounts for them all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;This makes such questions as &quot;would 20% of scientists agree...&quot; a poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;measurment of theory credibility, since (most) scientists do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;independantly hold opinions, but do so in consensus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You obviously don't understand how science works. Emotion, prejudice, and gut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feelings may play an important role early on, but eventually, all of that gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burned off in the crucible of science. Solid (and preferably replicable)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence is absolute king in the scientific world. NOTHING stands against that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for very long.
</em><br>
<p>I know that that is the &quot;myth&quot; promoted by the sciences. You obviously don't 
<br>
work with real scientists doing real research. As I've said before and will 
<br>
say again: 90% are dull witted (by extropian standards) sheep who follow the 
<br>
current consensus and couldn't innovate if you set them on fire.  Trying to 
<br>
find one who is willing to look at things entirely from a logical and 
<br>
evidential viewpoint is difficult.
<br>
<p>Now, much of research is dull, tedious, monotonous work which is well suited 
<br>
to be done by dull-witted sheep. The ability to create radical new paradigms 
<br>
and viewpoints when data are found to be contradictory is an ability of a 
<br>
depressingly small percentage of the scientists, but they account for most of 
<br>
the new ideas out there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include time dilation in the decay curves of distant type Ia supernova,
</em><br>
<p>Some measurements of which would have us conclude that some stars are older 
<br>
than the universe. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase in temperature of the cosmic background radiation (CMB) in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distant and early universe compared to today's universe,
</em><br>
<p>But said observations of the CMB show no sign of either the expected 
<br>
temperature increase due to energy dissipated during the gravitational 
<br>
collapse of galaxies from random dust, or of the gravitational effects that 
<br>
one would attribute to dark energy, if it was active in the distant past...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and its acoustic harmonic overtones in the anisotropy spectrum of the CMB,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the predicted dampening tail, and partial polarization of the CMB of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just the right kind that the big bang predicts. 
</em><br>
<p>This I agree with completely. Then again, I never claimed the Big Bang wasn't 
<br>
the BEST theory we have, just that its wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; NASA will release findings from the Microwave Anisotropy Probe that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure to strengthen these findings even more.
</em><br>
<p>Which I look forward to.
