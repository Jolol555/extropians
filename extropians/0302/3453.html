<p>
I'm having trouble getting email from the ExI server thru my
<br>
ISP again so apologies for not responding. I am getting posts
<br>
sent to me out of order and for large chunks of time (almost 7
<br>
hours late last night and early this morning Australian time) it seems
<br>
as though all posts from the ExI server routed to me as a subscriber
<br>
via my ISP bounced and they still have still not come thru now at
<br>
3.50pm).
<br>
<p>This is frustrating but short of emailing from the web list (which
<br>
I am reluctant to learn how to do just because I don't know why
<br>
the usual route isn't working) I currently seem to have to wait for my
<br>
ISP to get its act together and come up with a solution.)
<br>
<p>They say they had problems with a spam attack a couple of nights ago
<br>
and that they needed to add capacity but the problem they thought was
<br>
solved.. Unfortunately the times when I notice the problems
<br>
seems to be about 1am or later in the morning when the only people
<br>
on the help desk are first line tech support staff who are little more
<br>
knowledgeable than me and less interested in getting an understanding
<br>
of cause (which I want for confidence in having a reliable ISP). They
<br>
seem to think if no one is complaining the problem is solved.
<br>
<p>Aaagh.  ;-)
<br>
<p>My mailbox has not received the posts between this one below
<br>
(which I received at 12.06 (after midnight) on 24 Feb 03.)

I have an IT tech support background but most recently in management
not in tech support.
When it comes to conspiracy theories I am with Dossy on Occam's Razor
but given some of the stuff I am posting on- Game Theory &quot;solutions&quot; on
Iraq and questions on US breaches of treaties - and that some of the stuff
that is not getting to my mailbox are answers to these contemporary
questions
I would like to know why I'm not getting chunks of mail without long delays.
I wonder why my ISP in particular is getting spammed and why not all
messages are getting blocked.
A couple of nights again I could not send a test message to my own userid
without long turn around times. The first level help support guy at my ISP
couldn't get an email from me or send me one. He said he was at the mail
server. He also said he could see no buffered messages to me.
Any tech heads-up advice much appreciated. I'd like to be able to give my
ISP something to check or to know if I need to get away from my ISP.
I would like to know if particular messages sent and responses to them
can be buffered off.
Regards,
Brett
