FROM NANOTECHNOLOGY'S SIDELINES, ONE MORE WARNING
<br>
<p>February 3, 2003
<br>
By BARNABY J. FEDER
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/03/technology/03NANO.html?ex=1045299506&amp;ei=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/03/technology/03NANO.html?ex=1045299506&amp;ei=1</a>.33<br>
&amp;en=dc4c6b06081c0f81
<br>
<p><p><p>The ETC group releases nervous commentary on nanotechnology
<br>
in the same way a lot of companies update their software:
<br>
each version is compatible with what was said before but
<br>
adds new features.
<br>
<p>The latest effort by ETC - which pronounces its name &quot;et
<br>
cetera&quot; - is an 80-page illustrated manifesto called &quot;The
<br>
Big Down,&quot; its most elaborate effort yet to generate alarm
<br>
among the global network of social, labor and environmental
<br>
groups.
<br>
<p>Nanotechnology refers to the manipulation of matter at the
<br>
scale of atoms and molecules to create novel forms of
<br>
common materials, like carbon molecules arranged in
<br>
nanotubes, which are 100 times as strong as steel but much
<br>
lighter. Proponents describe a future in which
<br>
nanotechnology will lead to other wonders, like minute
<br>
diagnostic systems to detect cancers when they are no more
<br>
than a few cells in size, or data-storage systems that
<br>
could contain the Library of Congress in a device the size
<br>
of a sugar cube.
<br>
<p>But &quot;The Big Down&quot; warns of the risks of allowing big
<br>
business to pursue and promote technologies whose health
<br>
and environmental consequences may not be fully understood.
<br>
<p><p>The rhetoric is hardly dispassionate. &quot;Today,&quot; it warns,
<br>
&quot;mighty Goliath (industrial corporations) has learned his
<br>
lesson and is exploiting the power of small to become
<br>
mightier still, while little David (society) cannot even
<br>
see his opponent.&quot;
<br>
<p>That might all seem like ignorable fringe-group ranting if
<br>
ETC and its executive director, Pat Roy Mooney, did not
<br>
already have a reputation for successfully stirring things
<br>
up. During the 1990's, they faced down Monsanto and other
<br>
chemical giants in a public debate over the ethics of
<br>
creating genetically modified plants whose seeds were
<br>
sterile.
<br>
<p>And like the manifesto, Mr. Mooney is more often cautiously
<br>
earnest than shrill. &quot;We are not assuming this is an evil,
<br>
awful technology,&quot; Mr. Mooney said last week. &quot;I suspect
<br>
quite a bit can be done that's useful.&quot; The danger, he
<br>
said, is that governments and public interest groups do not
<br>
have enough control over assessing risks and setting
<br>
priorities.
<br>
<p>Mr. Mooney began distributing the report 10 days ago in
<br>
Porto Alegre, Brazil, at the World Social Forum, a
<br>
gathering held annually to coincide with the far more
<br>
well-heeled World Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland. It
<br>
is also posted on ETC's Web site (www.etcgroup.org).
<br>
<p>ETC consists of just seven employees in Winnipeg, Manitoba,
<br>
its headquarters, and in Carrboro, N.C.; Mexico City; and
<br>
Oxford, England. Its annual budget is roughly $525,000,
<br>
most of it raised from donors, like the Rockefeller
<br>
Foundation, that have long been involved with the needs of
<br>
developing countries.
<br>
<p>Mr. Mooney, 55, who has been legally blind since the age of
<br>
12, is a native of the prairies near Winnipeg. He
<br>
cheerfully admits that he dropped out of high school
<br>
shortly before he would have been kicked out for ignoring
<br>
his studies.
<br>
<p>His résumé includes working as a consultant for the United
<br>
Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization as a young man
<br>
and subsequent involvement in a wide range of development
<br>
projects in Asia, Africa and Latin America. But he has no
<br>
credentials as a researcher in nanotechnology, a field that
<br>
takes its name from the word nanometer - one-billionth of a
<br>
meter.
<br>
<p>In a telephone interview last week, Mihail C. Roco, the
<br>
head of the United States government's National
<br>
Nanotechnology Initiative, dismissed ETC as &quot;nonscientific&quot;
<br>
and &quot;a group that fights against technology.&quot; In fact,
<br>
though, Mr. Mooney agrees completely with authorities like
<br>
Mr. Roco that nanotechnology is the next big thing.
<br>
<p>But Mr. Mooney has trouble setting aside his fears that the
<br>
new technology will go awry. He is not particularly worried
<br>
about tiny robots creating copies of themselves until they
<br>
crowd out human life - the &quot;gray goo&quot; catastrophe posited
<br>
by some scientists and popularized in Michael Crichton's
<br>
recent novel, &quot;Prey.&quot;
<br>
<p>Instead, Mr. Mooney fears what he calls green goo:
<br>
microorganisms that have been manipulated through
<br>
nanotechnology to take over the function of machines but
<br>
that begin reproducing out of control. He worries about
<br>
environmental damage and diseases driven by unexpected
<br>
responses of people and other living things to the
<br>
accumulation in their systems of artificial particles the
<br>
Earth has never seen before.
<br>
<p>Nanotechnology experts who have been paying closer
<br>
attention to ETC and Mr. Mooney are less dismissive than
<br>
Mr. Roco. &quot;Making fun of Pat Mooney is not the way to go
<br>
here,&quot; said Christine Peterson, co-founder and president of
<br>
the Foresight Institute, nanotechnology's leading forum for
<br>
discussion. &quot;This is a sincere, smart man who doesn't have
<br>
any trouble with logic.&quot;
<br>
<p>Another expert who voices at least grudging respect is
<br>
Kevin D. Ausman, executive director for operations at the
<br>
Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology at
<br>
Rice University, a new federally financed research center.
<br>
&quot;ETC is the first nonscientific group to start to address
<br>
the issue of toxic impact of nanomaterials,&quot; Mr. Ausman
<br>
said. But he expressed dismay that ETC is warning of risks
<br>
he considers to be in the realm of science fiction, like
<br>
green goo.
<br>
<p>Putting Mr. Mooney most at odds with the nanotechnology
<br>
community is his call for a moratorium on research and
<br>
commercialization until international agreements have been
<br>
reached on ways to assess and monitor nanotechnology's
<br>
risks. Mr. Roco and others say that such problems are
<br>
already being addressed and that a research moratorium
<br>
would impede scientists' understanding of nanoparticles -
<br>
natural and artificial - that already exist, while delaying
<br>
the potential health and environmental benefits of new
<br>
nanoproducts and systems.
<br>
<p>But Ms. Peterson, of the Foresight Institute, recalls Mr.
<br>
Mooney's response when she questioned his strategy of
<br>
calling for a moratorium: &quot;It gets people's attention.&quot;
