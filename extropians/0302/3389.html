<p><em>&gt; &gt; You have to know, when you see yourself start writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like this, knowingly advocating greater pain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suffering, that something is out of kilter.  Yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I do appreciate that from your point of view, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are *ABSOLUTELY* no reasons whatsoever to invade Iraq,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and so from your point of view we are all raving mad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Is this true, or not?  Or am I reading too much into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what *you* are saying, now?)  But that's what it sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I knew it would get me that far when I decided not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave the field to the war supporters of this list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I knew exactly that I would be transformed into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same kind of dragon myself who I was fighting against.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I must say you're being a very reasonable and engaging
<br>
dragon.  Or hawk, whatever.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I can bear these complementary poles, It is an excellent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercise for the unity of psychological opposite pairs you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [we] will probably have to bear as a transhuman entity.
</em><br>
<p>Well, each to his own, and many people wish to *express* 
<br>
themselves in many ways here.  And as outrageous as some
<br>
of it sounds to others, we have to keep the physical
<br>
reality in mind: no one here is suffering as a result,
<br>
and it's highly unlikely that anyone in the world is
<br>
suffering as a result of what is said here.  So even
<br>
if someone said that he wished all the war-protestors
<br>
taken out and shot, it's a far cry from anyone getting
<br>
even a bad headache.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I put on the shoe that Mike Lorrey threw at us war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opponents*?  So I tried to come up with an equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the pain of the poor American soldiers and Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilians, he and the other hawks are willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it cannot be wrong to recall the moral costs of
<br>
making a decisive move, such as giving the final 
<br>
go-ahead for an invasion in which many will die.
<br>
Eisenhower, Bush, Hitler, and Saddam all have that
<br>
in common.  One can only hope that leaders of the
<br>
present and future do keep this reality in mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am aware of this with every word I write, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have it under control... It is my drastic way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of saying &quot;wake up!&quot; to those who accept 300.000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead and one million refugees and a lot of more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misery in Iraq.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but of course your opposite numbers can
<br>
always answer back about the future casualties
<br>
they extrapolate if action is *not* taken.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually I would never turn on this future Buddha machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all encompassing sympathy with the wounded.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's what always happens to me too.  After
<br>
I've read about some grisly murders---like the
<br>
snipers who killed so many in Washington D.C.,
<br>
I allow myself to think of the way I would leave
<br>
the killers in solitary confinement for a few
<br>
years, and when they are least expecting it, a
<br>
bullet comes from nowhere and smashes a kneecap.
<br>
But I'm sure that if I were really in charge of
<br>
the prisoners, I wouldn't have it done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But there are moments when I wished I had the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guts to do it to my own body-mind-continuum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to experience what war suffering really means.
</em><br>
<p>You're braver than I!  Seeing vivid depictions
<br>
on TV is about as much as I can stand.  Yet, as
<br>
you fully realize, the reality is so much worse.
<br>
Not only must we imagine the deaths themselves
<br>
of, maybe 100,000 Iraqis, but recall the pain
<br>
that their loved ones are going to experience.
<br>
Always think of 100,000 funerals to get the
<br>
clearest picture.
<br>
<p>So we hawks are thinking of the future atomic-
<br>
blasted cities, which are certain no matter what
<br>
happens.  We only believe that those attacks, with
<br>
their MILLIONS of casualties, can perhaps be
<br>
delayed a few years, or will be fewer altogether.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Isn't it strange: while writing down my fantasies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about this side effect of an uploading machine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had to think about you and Rafal musing on capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; punishment a couple of months ago, how it was *me*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who got infuriated by your kind of sarcasm.
</em><br>
<p>Sarcasm?  Was it that some scenarios that we were
<br>
mentally considering were too grisly, or in bad
<br>
taste?  I don't remember.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think I remember that you demanded freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thinking and writing about all the funny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things you wanted to impose on people who were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentenced to death.
</em><br>
<p>I do recall that Rafal and I would certainly look
<br>
into making prisons less comfortable than now.  We
<br>
probably are interesting in providing greater 
<br>
deterrence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, now I am on a similar level of writing here.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. Seems different.  You are talking about a real
<br>
war, about to happen, and he and I were discussing
<br>
hypothetical scenarios.  (In the first place, were
<br>
either he or I placed in charge of prisons, we would
<br>
be quite professional about studying the way they're
<br>
run now, and we'd listen very carefully to the
<br>
professionals and their arguments before deciding.)
<br>
<p>So your concerns are more immediate.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am aware of it but I do not regret it.  It only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows me what already the *prospect* of a war is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing to the mind of an originally peaceful man.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a shame and you can blame me for this.  That's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; okay.  I don't have anything to lose.
</em><br>
<p>Not truly lose anything, no.  But your speech was
<br>
hyperbolic, and, since you admit that you don't
<br>
really approve of any of us experiencing the real,
<br>
frightful agonies of the wounded, your speech was
<br>
exaggerated.  Which, of course, you realize.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a crucial moment of world history and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will not shut up.
</em><br>
<p>You are still entertaining, somehow, the suspicion
<br>
that someone wishes you'd shut up.  Not in any way!
<br>
Well..., at least not most of us ;-)   I think that
<br>
even your severest critics would actually be disappointed
<br>
if you didn't give them a target for their own thoughts
<br>
and feelings!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Call it *aggressive pacifism* or *pacifimania* or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever you want. My family name is my life's program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Okay, just don't start hitting anyone over the head
<br>
with those peace placards!  8^D
