<em>&gt; That being said, I am actually impressed that an aircraft that flies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such extreme performance regimes has lasted that long. It seems from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial evidence that it only failed due to something falling off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; main fuel tank striking the left wing and damaging its heat tiling.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am completely amazed at the longevity of the shuttles. They are tough old 
<br>
birds for sure.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I sincerely hope that NASA and our government takes this opportunity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop not just newer shuttles, but their outright replacement. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shuttle loss from skin damage due to things falling off the fuel tank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been a real threat. This isn't the first time some damage has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occured, either, there have been several instances where ice falling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off the tank has struck the shuttle and caused some damage, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never enough to cause a burnthrough like this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>We are now in the position where two catastrophic failures have resulted from 
<br>
issues with the main external tank (If the latest theory is true) 
<br>
If I were in front of a drawing board at NASA right now, I would be busily 
<br>
sketching out new tank designs or better yet, some new launch systems.
<br>
<p>Despite the age and extreme conditions that shuttles undertake. They have 
<br>
faired pretty well over the years with few actual shuttle failures. 
<br>
this shows something for safety and reliability of the reusable vehicle basic 
<br>
concept.
<br>
<p>I must admit that the heat tiles on the exterior have always made me laugh. 
<br>
The idea of taking a foot cubed block of the material and machining it down 
<br>
to an individual tile, That can only be positioned in one place is almost 
<br>
ridiculous. It would be more cost effective and quicker to manufacture the 
<br>
entire underbelly from one block. The logistics of getting thousands of tiles 
<br>
manufactured and fitted is incredible. Even keeping tabs on the masters used 
<br>
for the machining process must be a major headache.
<br>
<p>What about a spray on solution?
<br>
