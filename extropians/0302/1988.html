<p><em>&gt; I was thinking of a windfall as being something good that 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; profits.  However I do tend to think that the price of oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflects a very short sighted view.  It seems likely that my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children's children will live in a time of very expensive oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it also seems somewhat likely that their lives will be of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower quality because of that.  I see this as a threat to long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term progress.
</em><br>
<p>Not so great a faith in the future, eh?  ;-)  Many of us
<br>
are quite sanguine about the prospect of eventually running
<br>
out of oil.  I've even gathered that the Greens don't harp
<br>
on it much anymore, actually conceding that &quot;we'll never
<br>
run out of oil&quot;.  Presumably, they were talking about its
<br>
gradual price increase when it does start to threaten to
<br>
become more scarce.
<br>
<p>I daresay that most people on this list suppose that other
<br>
sources of energy will become available long before the
<br>
demise of oil.  And I'm sure that I'm not alone in noting
<br>
the tremendous material progress of the past centuries, and
<br>
it's almost certain likelihood of accelerating at an even
<br>
greater rate.  Have you read any of the very Extropian 
<br>
literature around, like Damien Broderick's &quot;The Spike&quot; or
<br>
&quot;The Last Mortal Generation&quot; (my favorite)?
<br>
<p>Few hear will join you in feeling sorry for your children's
<br>
children;  rather, extreme envy is the norm for most of us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - what if not only did a small group of people control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the oil reserves but all the land, mineral and water
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources of the world.  That group of people then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively enslaves the remaining people.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that from the perspective of taking mankind to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next level, however you envision that process, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aforementioned situation is harmful.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  But to me it's only harmful because they will
<br>
perhaps not choose to freely trade to their best
<br>
advantage.  It really doesn't matter how rich they
<br>
get.  What do they do with the money?  It's the same
<br>
paradox that afflicts Japanese, Chinese, and Europeans
<br>
that horde American dollars:  the best they can do with
<br>
it, pretty near, is invest it in the U.S. or some other
<br>
quite profitable Western country.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However the person who controls a resource (perhaps keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it out of the market and preventing someone else from making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic use of it) contributes nothing.
</em><br>
<p>That would be so, I think, if it were really possible.
<br>
Right now, I'm too tired to be able to imagine such a
<br>
thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The land speculator, the oil magnate, generally these folks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not doing anything for the economy
</em><br>
<p>Oh, but they are.  You may be falling into what is called
<br>
the &quot;Physical Fallacy&quot;.  I will post something on that
<br>
right now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; iv.   Some consumption shifts away from oil to alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; v.    Demand for oil decreases slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; vi.   To maintain revenues oil producers drop prices a little (*)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, say that the tax increases were infinitesimal, and so your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; price drop here is infinitesimal (by looking at the derivatives,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we might see the cause/effect relationship more easily).  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; did you say what happened to the consuming economy?  Does (vi)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; result in as much oil as used previously or not?  I guess that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; either way, your point is that the oil producing countries get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; less money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There would no doubt be unintended consequences. Are those unintended 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences greater than the unintended consequences of a tax on income? 
</em><br>
<p>It's beyond me.  But I think that someone opined on this not
<br>
long ago in this very thread.  Perhaps he or she will answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why must the consumption of oil return to its previous level for economic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harm to be prevented?  What if I replace my aged boiler with a more efficient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model since oil &quot;feels&quot; more expensive (it really isn't under my scenario)?
</em><br>
<p>I think of an economy as a natural ecosystem.  I realize
<br>
that there is a little bit of Rousseau here, but bear with
<br>
me.  It's almost as though an ecosystem maximizes complexity
<br>
with respect to the available energy in some sense.  (Kauffman
<br>
in his books, &quot;Investigations&quot; is a recent one, is always going
<br>
on about this.)  Well, a freely working Western type economy is
<br>
very much the same way:  it naturally maximizes total wealth,
<br>
save for the (a) disinclination of its members to engage in
<br>
trade and honest work (b) meddling of governments with taxes
<br>
and regulations.  Now, to be sure, both (a) and (b) are highly
<br>
culture dependent, so much so that there has yet to be a
<br>
culture that is capable of working with zero such interference
<br>
from the government.  Western societies are advanced primarily
<br>
for the reason that they *can* do quite nicely with only a
<br>
minimum amount of taxation and government regulation.  So
<br>
*any* taxation and regulation beyond this minimum is quite
<br>
harmful, taking us from one exponential growth curve to a
<br>
lower one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm using less oil and now I have more money for the movies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a US boiler making company just made a healthy sale to me.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it all comes down to *WHO* decides.  Who decides
<br>
that it's time for you to replace your old boiler?  Optimally,
<br>
the answer should be that you do, when and only when you really
<br>
need to.  Pushing you into a replacement that is *too early*
<br>
only destroys wealth.  It cannot create wealth.
<br>
<p>For example, all these stupid tax incentives to get people or
<br>
businesses to do something, only destroy wealth.  They provide
<br>
artificial incentives to get people to make intrinsically
<br>
uneconomic decisions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't remember Le Chatelier's principle, I'll have to go look it up! I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think taxing income is far more harmful to the economy than taxing oil 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imports.
</em><br>
<p>That principle in chemistry suggests that when a system is
<br>
in equilibrium, it kind of resists any change that you try
<br>
to make to it.  It's just a crazy intuition I have, that
<br>
somehow the economy is like that.  But it is true, as you
<br>
noted, that we always have to watch out for the unintended
<br>
side-effects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thanks Lee, and to the other contributors to this thread,
</em><br>
<p>Oh, that goes without saying!  Thank you!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I apologize for not addressing all your comments directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I must revert to lurking for a few days.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  We probably ought not to see our contributions
<br>
here being any kind of obligation ;-)  but rather just as
<br>
occasional creative exchanges when time and energy permit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (*) I have been developing a wood fired steam engine co-generation system in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my spare time over the past too-many-to-count years and I suppose I must come 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clean and admit that I might have a selfish reason to see oil imports taxed! 
</em><br>
<p>Great!  Your inventiveness may make all of us a tad bit richer.
<br>
Even if the odds are a hundred to one, the presence of hundreds
<br>
of people like you really does increase world wealth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But hey! It would mean more jobs if I could turn the blinking thing into a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product. :)  With heating oil at $1.50 a gallon its only another .50 to go to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic viability. Time to get back to work on the prototype...
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and don't forget it's your duty to get rich!
<br>
(By judicious economic exchanges with everyone
<br>
else, of course.)  Good luck!
<br>
