<p>London's little idea. Nanotechnology may be the science of the small, but it
<br>
is surely destined for bigger things. The new London Centre for
<br>
Nanotechnology (LCN), due to open in 2004, is a joint venture between
<br>
University College London and Imperial College, designed to put British
<br>
science at the centre of this emerging field. Based in a new building with
<br>
purpose-built clean rooms and laboratories, the centre is funded by a
<br>
£13.65m higher education grant under the Science Research Infrastructure
<br>
Fund. (BBC 1/27/03)

<p>Jefferson Lab's Free-Electron Laser explores promise of carbon nanotubes. A
<br>
research team led by Brian Holloway, an assistant professor at the College
<br>
of William &amp; Mary's Department of Applied Science, used Jefferson Lab's
<br>
Free-Electron Laser to explore the fundamental science of how and why
<br>
nanotubes form, paying close attention to the atomic and molecular details.

Already, in experiments, the William &amp; Mary/NASA Langley collaboration has
<br>
produced tubes better than those at other laboratories or in industry.

<p>Nanotech can be tragedy or triumph, says new group. A new non-profit
<br>
organization has been formed to advance the safe use of molecular
<br>
nanotechnology. The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology (CRN) was founded
<br>
by Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder in December 2002. The vision of CRN is a
<br>
world in which nanotechnology is widely used for productive and beneficial
<br>
purposes, and where malicious uses are limited by effective administration
<br>
of the technology.

<p>Very small solutions. One of the biggest names in the field of teensy
<br>
science was a huge hit with students at Dutch Hill Elementary School Tuesday
<br>
morning. Viola Vogel, director of the Center for Nanotechnology at the
<br>
University of Washington, wowed a roomful of curious students with her
<br>
expertise in the revolutionary field of nanotechnology. &quot;We were so lucky
<br>
she came,&quot; said sixth-grader Anna Boll. &quot;She knows the most, and it's going
<br>
to help us sound smarter in the competition.&quot; Boll and her classmates are
<br>
working to qualify for a state problem-solving competition. This year's
<br>
topic is nanotechnology. (Herald Net 1/29/03)

<p>Watchdogs say stop nanotech, start worldwide dialogue. An advocacy group
<br>
that helped quash efforts to introduce genetically modified products in
<br>
Europe, Africa and elsewhere intensified the spotlight on nanotechnology

<p>Nanotechnology, Coming Soon. There is currently a race in progress to
<br>
commercialize nanotechnology disk drives. The companies involved are IBM,
<br>
Hewlett-Packard, Philips, Seagate and Nanochip, and possibly others. Disk
<br>
technology based on a moving head that hovers over a spinning disk is
<br>
reaching its physical limits and if greater density of storage is to be
<br>
achieved then a different mechanism is required. Research in nanotechnology
<br>
has unearthed a mechanism that fits the bill.

<p>Devil in the details? The molecule-size machines long promised by
<br>
nanotechnology now seem menacing to some. Nanotechnology, touted as
<br>
promising supermaterials and molecule-size robots, is starting to know
<br>
sin-or at least some bad PR. In his new techno-thriller, Prey, author
<br>
Michael Crichton presents supersmall, supersmart nanobots as itsy-bitsy
<br>
baddies. And in some corners of the real world, environmental groups and
<br>
arms control advocates are raising questions about possible health effects
<br>
of nanotech's tiny particles and the weapons potential of its tiny machines.
<br>
Sean Howard, a British political scientist and editor of Disarmament

<p>Bucky Diamonds In The Rough. Nanometer-size diamonds could have a
<br>
buckyball-like shape, prompting researchers to coin a new term: &quot;bucky
<br>
diamonds.&quot; Both diamonds and the soccer ball-shaped cage molecules called
<br>
buckyballs are made of pure carbon, and according to the 24 January print
<br>
issue of PRL, nanoscale diamonds could surround themselves with buckyball
<br>
shells. But several experts in the field are not convinced by the data. If
<br>
the work is confirmed, this new family of carbon clusters may provide new
<br>
insights for the development of optoelectronics--futuristic devices that
<br>
process both light and electrical signals. (Physical Review Focus 1/30/03)

<p>(Join the discussion at Geek.com) The nascent field of nanotechnology is
<br>
attracting increasing attention from electrical engineers. The field of
<br>
nanotechnology, which at this point is really only nanoscience, has only
<br>
recently gained legitimacy. All signs indicate, however, that it is poised
<br>
for robust growth during the coming decade. One of the problems with this
<br>
subject, however, is that there is little agreement on what constitutes
<br>
&quot;nanotechnology.&quot; Some (including Intel) refer to nanotechnology as any
<br>
technology that utilizes components smaller than 100 nanometers. Others have
<br>
more radical visions of nanotechnology. These proponents foresee molecular
<br>
assemblers building computers that are millions of times faster than current
<br>
computers. User discussion: what jobs are there, Crichton's book Prey, and
<br>
education. (Geek.com 1/28/03)

<p>Ultra-High-Density Data Storage May Become Practical with Breakthrough in
<br>
Nanoscale Magnetic Sensors. A simpler and more reliable manufacturing method
<br>
has allowed two materials researchers to produce nanoscale magnetic sensors
<br>
that could increase the storage capacity of hard disk drives by a factor of
<br>
a thousand. Building on results reported last summer, the new sensors are up
<br>
to 100 times more sensitive than any current alternative technology. Susan
<br>
Hua and Harsh Deep Chopra, both professors at the State University of New
<br>
York at Buffalo, report in the February issue of Physical Review B on their
<br>
latest experiments with nanoscale sensors that produce, at room temperature,
<br>
unusually large electrical resistance changes in the presence of small

magnetic fields. (NSF 1/30/03)

<p>Disruptive technologies. Now is the time to prepare for two coming
<br>
disruptors: open-source software and nanotechnology. Two potentially
<br>
disruptive technologies watched closely by integrators today are open-source
<br>
software and nanotechnology. Each holds the promise of radically changing
<br>
the landscape of information technology. The concept of open-source
<br>
software, for example, challenges many notions about how software should be
<br>
created and sold. Linux, developed under the open-source license, is already
<br>
provoking turmoil in the market for operating systems. &quot;If you are an
<br>
entrenched proprietary software vendor, this paradigm shift can be
<br>
alarming,&quot; said John Weathersby, chairman of the Oxford, Miss.-based Open
<br>
Source Software Institute. However, integrators and vendors that exploit the
<br>
growing open-software movement in government can crack new markets,
<br>
especially in the Department of Defense, where numerous offices are using
<br>
open-source solutions as low-cost alternatives to commercial software. The
<br>
same holds true for nanotechnology. Although still a few years out,
<br>
nanotechnology can greatly expand the role of integrators as small, cheap
<br>
computational devices are placed in everything from shoes to unmanned aerial
<br>
vehicles. (Washington Technology 1/27/03)

<p>Scientists See Progress in Untangling Nanotubes. Scientists at the
<br>
University of Pennsylvania claim they have made progress toward a solution
<br>
for one of the biggest obstacles against implementing carbon nanotubes in
<br>
electronics, materials and healthcare applications. Carbon nanotubes have
<br>
frustrated researchers in every field with their stubborn and unhelpful
<br>
tendency to clump together in solution. According to the Penn scientists, a
<br>
readily available chemical, a surfactant called sodium dodecylbenzene
<br>
sulfonate (NaDDBS), disperses nanotubes in water with remarkable efficiency.
<br>
The discovery is described in a paper published this month in the journal
<br>
Nanoletters. &quot;Scientists have suggested many possible applications for
<br>
carbon nanotubes, but tube aggregation in solution has obstructed progress,&quot;
<br>
said lead author Mohammad Islam, a postdoctoral researcher in Penn's
<br>
Department of Physics and Astronomy. &quot;This new approach improves our ability
<br>
to manipulate single tubes. Single nanotubes can now participate in
<br>
controlled self-assembly, form fibers and composites, and serve as
<br>
microfluidic sensors in water.&quot; (Nanotech Planet 1/30/03)

<p>Nanoscale waveguides provide view of single molecules. A group of

researchers at Cornell University here perforated the top layer of a chip

with two million &quot;holes&quot; that serve as nanoscale waveguides for a

488-nanometer laser, allowing them to film individual molecules during
<br>
chemical reactions. Professor Watt Webb's group put 40-nanometer holes in
<br>
the aluminum top layer of a 25 millimeter square chip. &quot;Conventional wisdom
<br>
would tell you that this is not a single- or multimode waveguide, since its

size is ten times smaller than the light going through it. Rather, we call
<br>
it a zero-mode waveguide,&quot; said postdoctoral fellow Michael Levene. (EETimes
