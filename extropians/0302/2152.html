<p>Well, I think the VW Rabbit is an old design (correct me if I'm wrong).
<br>
Diesel engines are not noted for performance (even turbocharged
<br>
diesel engines). But modern small petrol-engined European cars are
<br>
designed to be able to keep up with the traffic and are very lively to
<br>
drive. Cheeky, some might say, after one cuts in front of you in city
<br>
traffic into an impossibly tight space. Five and six speed gearboxes and
<br>
very high-revving engines make them pretty capable performers.
<br>
(You ever seen the way Italians drive ?!!)
<br>
<p>I have never heard of a minimum speed limit in UK. I don't know about
<br>
Europe. On the freeway, the UK has an official maximum speed limit of 70
<br>
mph, though most traffic seems to run at around 75-80 mph. (10% excess
<br>
is usually permissible :-)!) On long uphill stretches, loaded with two
<br>
people plus luggage, I might have to drop down from fifth gear to
<br>
fourth, but it will still manage 60-70 mph fine. Holdups in UK are
<br>
generally caused by very old cars (20-year old cars are not unusual) and
<br>
cars towing caravans.
<br>
<p>I agree that I also try to keep a big space between me and other cars.
<br>
(Defensive driving, they call it. They run training courses on it in UK)
<br>
<p>But driving toy cars does require a different attitude of mind, (even if
<br>
it is fun), that I think Americans will have difficulty adjusting to.
<br>
<p>Regards, BillK
