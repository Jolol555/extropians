<p>Exactly! Why on earth don't you just IGNORE these threads instead of
<br>
implanting scissors into the brains of your community members? Though I
<br>
hated the gun dicussions of the past years I nevertheless got infuriated
<br>
when they were banned. And I feel the same when it comes to this new kind of
<br>
mild censorship.
<br>
<p>I can tell you, the Iraq discussions cost a lot of nerve cells. I never
<br>
expected to have to deal with people here on the list who end every email
<br>
with a quote from Richard Nixon and use a George Orwell impression from the
<br>
1940s to push pacifist into the circle of fascists. Or people who say they
<br>
passed a place where massive violations of democratic rights took place
<br>
(Chicago 1968/9?) twice a day and did not notice anything wrong. This always
<br>
leaves me speechless . . .
<br>
<p>BUT....
<br>
<p>now that an imbecile US President who believes he is God sent wants to set
<br>
the world on fire it would be remote from reality to ban such a vital topic.
<br>
Despite some flame mails I still believe in the rational mindset behind all
<br>
the stirred up emotions and I still regard  a conservative, patriotic and
<br>
war supporting transhumanist as a member of this community. So I want to
<br>
listen to what he says because in the end I do have trust in them and
<br>
believe that we have very important common goals that I would not find in
<br>
the majority of my like minded pacifist friends. And anyway...it always
<br>
sharpens your intellectual tools to deal with those who oppose you stance.
<br>
Always receiving applause is getting boring.
<br>
<p>So please, all you wannabe banners: simply ignore the Iraq threads and let
<br>
us in &quot;peace&quot;, with our war.
