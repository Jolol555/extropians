You sound pretty juiced about this.
<br>
===================================
<br>
Well, yeah, absolutely, how could you not be?
<br>
===================================
<br>
I don't know, but after awhile you've worked in the government a long time. 
<br>
You know the political side of all of this. You know the limitations. Yet 
<br>
you think there's still great possibilities and probabilities here.
<br>
===================================
<br>
They're just around the corner. It's always the amazing thing about working 
<br>
a portfolio like this and working in an exciting agency like this is that 
<br>
just around the corner you know there's something else just that more 
<br>
fascinating that you didn't see the day before and it, it's just a really 
<br>
uplifting kind of a challenge to be pursuing and one that really expands 
<br>
your creative juices a lot. It really does.
<br>
===================================
<br>
And in a job like this you have to rely on those people who live on the 
<br>
edge and love to live on the edge.
<br>
===================================
<br>
Positively.
<br>
<p><p><p>Do you ever see us going back to the moon?
<br>
==========================================
<br>
...but our mission right now is to be sure we can go there (or anywhere 
<br>
else), quickly.
<br>
And for people to be able to survive the experience...And that's the two 
<br>
areas we're looking for: power generation and propulsion capabilities, and 
<br>
human endurance. To assure that they are safely returned.
<br>
At NASA we believe in round-trips. That's the primary effort.
