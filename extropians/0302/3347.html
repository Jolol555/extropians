<p><em>&gt; What I mean is this: to many in the U.S. (or the Anglosphere?)

<em>&gt; hopeful entrants to the EU:  &quot;You must do as I say.  You may
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own opinions.  Just wait and see.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's not what he said.
<br>
<p>Let's start with a dose of reality:  Just what significance has the
<br>
position of Poland etc. in the big picture?  These countries cannot
<br>
project military force; if any of them happen to be in the Security
<br>
Council they have no veto power; they do not have the financial
<br>
resources to significantly contribute either to a war effort or to
<br>
the rebuilding afterwards.  In short, their position is irrelevant
<br>
in practice and only an expression of moral support and political
<br>
association.
<br>
<p>You might be under the assumption that those countries expressed
<br>
their true support for the USA because of a common stance against
<br>
totalitarianism etc.  Around here, the perception is that they
<br>
rather sucked up to the USA out of political opportunism.
<br>
<p>As you may know if you follow European politics, there have been
<br>
ongoing efforts for the last several years to forge a common European
<br>
foreign policy in order for Europe to be able to speak with a single
<br>
and correspondingly more powerful voice.  The candidate countries--who
<br>
after all have much to gain from EU membership--now seem to be
<br>
sabotaging this effort, which is already painful enough as is.
<br>
<p>That the French, who usually employ much more diplomatic language,
<br>
choose such direct and forceful expression should be evidence in
<br>
itself just what an affront this has been.
<br>
<p>The way this mess should have played out instead is that the EU
<br>
sits down, after much painful negotiation comes to a common position
<br>
and declaration, and of course it is expected that the countries
<br>
poised to join the Union share the common values and policy and
<br>
agree with this (or diplomatically shut up).   If you want something
<br>
from somebody, you don't start by offending them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, intimidating Iraq is okay, but if Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was to secretly say to the leader of Spain, &quot;you better sign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that letter or else you'll be sorry when it comes to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next round of trade negotiations!&quot;, it would be ABSOLUTELY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DISASTROUS if that leaked out (as it invariably would).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be seen as attempting compulsion.
</em><br>
<p>Funnily enough, around here the view is that's exactly what's going
<br>
on now as the USA is rallying up votes from the non-permanent members
<br>
of the Security Council.  (Not regarding Spain of course, but
<br>
concerning countries susceptible to US foreign aid, loans, etc.)
