<em>&gt;&gt; ### Good for you! I really have no problem with the promotion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; deprenyl as a nootropic, since here you present evidence of better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; quality, a double-blind randomized trial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well that's certainly a refreshing change of tune from you, Rafal.
</em><br>
<p>### Responding to a change of focus from hypothesizing about PD to
<br>
description of practical benefits proven in controlled studies.
<br>
<p>-----------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A few messages ago you were telling me that this drug was a waste of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time and money. You even suggested indirectly that my way of thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could kill people (re: my comparison of DATATOP to the recent halted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; study of female HRT).
</em><br>
<p>### If you hope for a longer survival in PD, it is a waste. If all you hope
<br>
for is hearing music better, etc., you are apparently getting your money's
<br>
worth.
<br>
<p>--------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Is it likely to enhance cognitive ability in normal healthy humans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it likely to enhance sex drive in normal healthy humans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it likely to improve mood in normal healthy humans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it likely to protect neurons from neurotoxins and excitotoxins in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normal healthy humans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it likely to improve life-expectancy in normal healthy humans?
</em><br>
<p>### My answers: yes, don't know, yes, unknown, unknown.
<br>
<p>------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately drug companies do not spend R&amp;D money in an effort to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve the lives of normal healthy humans, so we are forced to base
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our opinions on indirect data and personal experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### That drug companies do not address the life-enhancement and
<br>
life-extension issues is indeed quite bad. I think it is due to drug
<br>
prescription laws, and the over-reliance of customers on health insurance.
<br>
If citizens used health insurance only for catastrophic spending (surgery,
<br>
etc.), paid for routine medications cash, and could buy it without
<br>
prescription, the prices of drugs would be lower, and the incentive to prove
<br>
their efficacy beyond medical situations would be much higher - cash paid
<br>
for deprenyl taken for depression would be the same if it was taken for
<br>
life-extension. All we would need would be an independent authority (perhaps
<br>
derived from the FDA) verifying the claims of drug makers, but not
<br>
restricting their sale.
<br>
<p>Well, just dreaming.
<br>
<p>Rafal
