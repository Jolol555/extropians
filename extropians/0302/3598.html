Science Frontiers, No. 146, Mar-Apr, 2003, p. 3
<br>
<p>BIOLOGY
<br>
<p>Did ID have dimensional limits?
<br>
<p>ID (for &quot;Intelligent Design&quot;) is a hot topic in evolutionary philosophy.
<br>
Some scientists, such as M.J. Behe and W.A. Dembski, exhibit many examples
<br>
of what they term &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; in terrestrial life forms---
<br>
biochemistry in particular.  These, they claim, necessitated the
<br>
application [of] intelligent design by some &quot;unspecified&quot; entity.  ID
<br>
opponents assert that natural, *random* processes and natural selection
<br>
are sufficient to have created everything we now observe in our world,
<br>
limited though it may be.  But, *surprise,* hot as this subject may be,
<br>
we [have a]nother species of fish to fry in this item.
<br>
<p>We have netted two intriguing articles from the *Creation Research Society
<br>
Quarterly* that deserve the attention of anomalists and even the most
<br>
fervent reductionists---whatever their philosophical predilections.
<br>
<p>In the first article, W.I. Sivertsen takes four criteria established by C.
<br>
Sagan for the recognition of intelligent signals from space.  These criteria
<br>
are basic to the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) project.
<br>
The four criteria are:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Elegance;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Complexity;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Internal consistency; and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Possessing &quot;utterly alien&quot; characteristics
<br>
<p>Sivertsen applies these SETI criteria to DNA and finds that DNA easily meets
<br>
them.  We cannot deny that DNA is geometrically elegant, chemically complex,
<br>
and possesses internal consistency.  But is it &quot;utterly alien?&quot;  Sivertsen
<br>
so claims in these words:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth criterion raises several complex questions.  Does &quot;alien&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mean another rational mind besides a human mind?  If so, we would need
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ways to distinguish these non-human signals and to classify them as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;intelligent.&quot;  In the case of DNA, I submit that the *determinative*
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code relationships evident between codons, anticodons, and the amino
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acids in the resulting proteins are complex in a manner that is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different or &quot;alien&quot; in comparison to the *symbolic* code relationships
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in human code systems.
<br>
<p>Sivertsen's conclusion, as one would expect, is that DNA is the product of an
<br>
intelligent design.
<br>
<p>(Sivertsen, Walter I.; &quot;SETI and DNA,&quot; *Creation Research Society Quarterly,*
<br>
39:190, 2002.)
<br>
<p>In an earlier article in the same journal, J. Bergman and D.B. DeYoung make
<br>
a similar case for intelligent design in the realm of subatomic particles---
<br>
those fundamental [?] building blocks of matter.  Although, they do not
<br>
employ Sagan's exact terminology, we will do so as we mention some of their
<br>
examples.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Elegance (the neat 8-fold way);
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Complexity (the existence of over *500* different subatomic particles);
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Internal consistency (the symmetry and conservation rules);
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Utter alien-ness (dark matter, dark energy, etc.)
<br>
<p>Like Sivertsen above, these authors conclude that the subatomic realm was
<br>
intelligently designed.
<br>
<p>(Bergman, Jerry, and DeYoung, Don B.; &quot;Particle Physics and Paley's Watch,&quot;
<br>
*Creation Research Society Quarterly,* 39:73, 2002.)
<br>
<p>Comments.  This is all intriguing, but intelligence is a human construct.
<br>
Why should aliens be intelligent by our definition?  They may be
<br>
&quot;more-than-intelligent&quot; or &quot;other-than-intelligent.&quot;
<br>
<p>SETI searches for electromagnetic messages from outer space.  We have not
<br>
heard any signals of this sort, but we *do* find amino acids in meteorites;
<br>
maybe, eventually, we'll discover meteor-borne DNA, too.  Perhaps amino
<br>
acids and DNA *are* really messages from some intelligent entity---who need
<br>
not be supernatural.
<br>
<p>We can also apply Sagan's four criteria to cosmology (*greater* dimensions
<br>
than earth life) and, in the other direction, to whatever *smaller* &quot;things&quot;
<br>
make up the subatomic particles.
