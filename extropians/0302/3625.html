<p>You mean that we couldn't become any smarter because
<br>
we would go mad/crash/lose out on some other important
<br>
cognitive ability? I don't think there are any really
<br>
good evidence for this. Sure, bipolar disorder seems
<br>
to be overrepresented among mathematicians and
<br>
Asperger's syndrome among computer people, but that is
<br>
likely just that people with certain cognitive
<br>
pecularities seek out fields that fit them. 
<br>
<p>In my own field of memory research there might be some
<br>
limitations, due to upper bounds on the speed of
<br>
synaptic plasticity, the plasticity/stability dilemma
<br>
and the abstraction/representation dilemma.  But that
<br>
is not really about intelligence per se. 
<br>
<p>General intelligence seem to correlate with brain size 
<br>
and processing speed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the consequence is that using current brain architecture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we may be pressing up against the limits.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps. I'm not very convinced the human brain as it
<br>
is right now scales well (especially not in its
<br>
current energy-hungry, fragile and slow wetware
<br>
substrate), but it could be that a similar basic
<br>
architecture could be scaled up quite a bit and result
<br>
in a &quot;smarter&quot; system. An architecture with a square
<br>
kilometer of association cortex, basal ganglias meters
<br>
across and fast optronic updates might have the
<br>
potential to be very smart - but I wouldn't want to
<br>
bet on if it is by a hundred, a thousand or ten 
<br>
thousand &quot;IQ points&quot; (or however one measures 
<br>
intelligence for this kind of systems). 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Now, *if* we equate &quot;intelligence&quot; with &quot;OPS&quot; (a stretch,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but perhaps not too unreasonable)
</em><br>
<p>One could always think in terms of communities. A
<br>
Matrioshka running a few trillion trillion human minds
<br>
in parallel could solve problems in the same way as
<br>
human societies or civilizations do - lots of divergent
<br>
solution attempts, local criticism and resource
<br>
constraints promote initially promising solutions, they
<br>
become more widely used and explored by whole
<br>
institutions, and so on upwards to the highest
<br>
hierarchical levels. The advantage is that single minds
<br>
may have limited knowledge and resources, but through
<br>
their ant-like cooperation and clever institutional
<br>
means like markets it can be shared and amplified. 
<br>
<p>Still, I wonder if there is an upper limit to the 
<br>
cleverness of the kind of problems that can be solved 
<br>
by a society of minds of a certain complexity. 
<br>
Sufficiently large problems will of course not fit, but 
<br>
there could also be problems that cannot efficiently be 
<br>
handled by groups. Hmm, it would be interesting to find 
<br>
a way of characterizing the *problems*. Maybe the big 
<br>
problem isn't how to build intelligence, but how to 
<br>
characterize it...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Raises a very interesting question with regard to the Fermi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paradox.  Is the reason that the universe seems empty is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because all &quot;intelligences&quot; are eliminated at the end of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period of what they are invented to do?
</em><br>
<p>You mean there are a lot of civilizations around, but they are
<br>
all busy contemplating printouts with the solution to chess,
<br>
the complete set of fundamental equations for physics and the
<br>
number 42?
