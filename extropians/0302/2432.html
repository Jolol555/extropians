<p><em>&gt; From: Anders Sandberg [mailto:<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=RE:%20Cosmology%20Question">asa@nada.kth.se</a>] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think most cosmologists think of spatially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unbounded universes when they consider the open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universe scenario (although it is not topologically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; required). These would have an infinite number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; galaxies, although I don't think this is widely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remarked on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really?  I'm no cosmologist, but this doesn't jive with my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding.  An open universe is one that will expand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinitely and is therefore *eventually* infinite in volume.
</em><br>
<p>I'm no cosmologist either, but I think that your statement
<br>
applies to the *visible* universe---and THAT won't ever quite
<br>
be *infinite* itself:  at any point t in time, it'll still
<br>
have just finite volume.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, an open universe has finite mass, which clearly limits the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of galaxies.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree, and was hoping to get confirmation along the
<br>
lines that Anders has provided.  I believe that all the
<br>
confusion (when people speak of &quot;the universe&quot;) comes from
<br>
failing to distinguish between the visible universe---only
<br>
10 to 15 billion light years in radius---from the entire
<br>
universe, which IMO is infinite in radius.
<br>
<p>Here is why: if we assume isotropy (and whatever else it was),
<br>
then no one has center position.  Therefore, even the most
<br>
remote galaxies that we see, why, they think (in terms of
<br>
their own observations) that they're in the center too.  And
<br>
the most distant objects THEY can see, in the opposite
<br>
direction to us, also lie at the center of their visible
<br>
universe, and so on and so on, ad infinitum.  Thus the 
<br>
universe on this reading is infinite in extent.
<br>
<p>So unless the universe has a topology that results in it having
<br>
finite volume at any time---one way is to have a closed universe,
<br>
I guess---then not only is there no boundary, but the homogeneous
<br>
material (galaxies) extend infinitely far, just as do the integers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Indeed, if an open universe had an infinite number of galaxies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would have infinite mass, which would result in a mass density
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would guarantee collapse...
</em><br>
<p>Not if the initial acceleration away from each other is great
<br>
enough!
<br>
<p>But suppose that it is not great enough, and that there is a kind
<br>
of collapse eventually.  This still hardly precludes there being
<br>
infinitely many galaxies!  While we have trouble visualizing
<br>
infinitely many of anything rushing together to a &quot;point-like&quot;
<br>
place that has no &quot;center&quot;, there is a trick I have found to
<br>
visualize it.
<br>
<p>Say that right now two particular atoms are at distance apart X.
<br>
Then later, when a collapse has begun, they eventually find
<br>
themselves only X/2 distance apart.  We may visualize this as
<br>
being exactly the same as if each become twice as large, but
<br>
their positions did not change.  This I claim to be exactly
<br>
equivalent.
<br>
<p>The advantage of this latter way of looking at it, is that we
<br>
can imagine each atom---in the final moments before the utter
<br>
collapse---as becoming unboundedly large.  (One can easily 
<br>
construct functions, such as the redoubtable y = 1/x, which
<br>
have the property of assuming infinite values at the singularity
<br>
of x=0.  So think of the atom as following this course as x-&gt;0,
<br>
and assuming a size without bound.)
<br>
<p>I personally have less problem with imagining infinitely many
<br>
atoms each over time becoming bigger and bigger without bound
<br>
than I do with infinitely much matter converging to a point.
<br>
The difficulty with the latter picture is that it appears to
<br>
leave a vast space behind where the matter used to be, which
<br>
is incorrect.
<br>
<p>So on my contrary view, let us suppose that we can then visualize
<br>
the moment at which each atom is infinitely big and there is
<br>
no space at all between the atoms, and indeed they completely
<br>
overlap.  This is the Omega point when collapse is total.
<br>
<p>Now, by rewinding the picture from this point, we have a 
<br>
way of thinking about the Big Bang that begins with infinite
<br>
mass so-called &quot;concentrated at a point&quot; (but which I shall
<br>
prefer to equivalently think of as just being composed of
<br>
particles infinitely large all overlapping).  Then for any
<br>
positive epsilon greater than Zero (the time of the BB)
<br>
atoms have finite size yet there are infinitely many of
<br>
them---or whatever their primordial soup equivalents are.

<p>Perhaps, but I was excluding views not held by 20 percent
<br>
or more of physicists, and I personally don't have a 
<br>
problem with the BB (not that my credentials mean a damn).

<p><em>&gt; At the moment, the Big Bang theory is THE theory of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarded as being fatally flawed in a number of different ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is, we know that, as currently stated, it's wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Do you think that more than half of the professional 
<br>
physics community would agree with your statement that
<br>
the Big Bang theory is wrong?
