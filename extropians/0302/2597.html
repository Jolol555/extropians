<br>
<p>The currently favored theory of lunar origin is the giant-impact hypothesis.
<br>
Recent work that has modeled accretional growth in impact-generated disks
<br>
has found that systems with one or two large moons and external debris are
<br>
common outcomes. In this paper we investigate the evolution of terrestrial
<br>
multiple-moon systems as they evolve due to mutual interactions (including
<br>
mean motion resonances) and tidal interaction with Earth, using both
<br>
analytical techniques and numerical integrations. We find that multiple-moon
<br>
configurations that form from impact-generated disks are typically unstable:
<br>
these systems will likely evolve into a single-moon state as the moons
<br>
mutually collide or as the inner moonlet crashes into Earth.

<br>
<p>We perform three-dimensional N-body integrations of the final stages of
<br>
terrestrial planet formation. We report the results of 10 simulations
<br>
beginning with 22-50 initial planetary embryos spanning the range 0.5-1.5
<br>
AU, each with an initial mass of 0.04-0.13M&amp;oplus;. Collisions are treated
<br>
as inelastic mergers. We follow the evolution of each system for 2x108 years
<br>
at which time a few terrestrial type planets remain. On average, our
<br>
simulations produced two planets larger than 0.5M&amp;oplus; in the terrestrial
<br>
region (1 simulation with one m&gt;=0.5M&amp;oplus; planet, 8 simulations with two
<br>
m&gt;=0.5M&amp;oplus; planets, and 1 simulation with three m&gt;=0.5M&amp;oplus; planets).
<br>
These Earth-like planets have eccentricities and orbital spacing
<br>
considerably larger than the terrestrial planets of comparable mass (e.g.,
<br>
Earth and Venus). We also examine the angular momentum contributions of each
<br>
collision to the final spin angular momentum of a planet, with an emphasis
<br>
on the type of impact which is believed to have triggered the formation of
<br>
the Earth's Moon. There was an average of two impacts per simulation that
<br>
contributed more angular momentum to a planet than is currently present in
<br>
the Earth/Moon system. We determine the spin angular momentum states of the
<br>
growing planets by summing the contributions from each collisional
<br>
encounter. Our results show that the spin angular momentum states of the
<br>
final planets are generally the result of contributions made by the last few
<br>
large impacts. Our results suggest that the current angular momentum of the
<br>
Earth/Moon system may be the result of more than one large impact rather
<br>
than a single impact. Further, upon suffering their first collision, the
<br>
planetary embryos in our simulations are spinning rapidly throughout the
<br>
final accretion of the planets, suggesting the proto-Earth may have been
<br>
rotating rapidly prior to the Moon-forming impact event.

<br>
<p>We present the first published numerical calculations of accretion of an
<br>
impact-generated protolunar disk into a single large Moon. Our calculations
<br>
are based on the model developed by R. M. Canup and L. W. Esposito (Icarus
<br>
113, 331-352, 1995) to describe accretion in the Roche zones around the
<br>
giant planets. Previous numerical simulations of a large impact event
<br>
predict the formation of a disk of material centered near or within the
<br>
Roche limit (~2.9R_&amp;oplus;). A natural expectation based on our previous
<br>
results and comparison with the satellite systems of the outer planets would
<br>
be for multiple small moons to arise from such a protolunar disk. Multiple
<br>
moonlets could accrete to form a single Moon if they evolved into crossing
<br>
orbits due to tidal interaction with the Earth. This would occur if the
<br>
innermost moonlet in the disk were also the most massive, so that it evolved
<br>
outward at the relatively fastest rate and swept up all exterior material.
<br>
Our calculations, which include both moonlet accretion and orbital
<br>
evolution, demonstrate that forming massive moonlets in the inner disk near
<br>
the Roche limit is extremely difficult. We conclude that an Earth system
<br>
with multiple moons is the final result unless some particularly severe
<br>
constraints on initial conditions in the disk are met. A disk with a lunar
<br>
mass of material exterior to a ~ 3.5-4R_&amp;oplus; or an extremely steep radial
<br>
surface density profile at the onset of collisional growth is required for a
<br>
single, lunar-sized body to result from accretion of silicate density
<br>
material in a protolunar disk. The former corresponds most closely to disks
<br>
produced by impactors with nearly twice the mass of Mars and about twice the
<br>
angular momentum of the current Earth/Moon system. Other processes, such as
<br>
gravitational instability or primary accretion of an iron core in the inner
<br>
disk, might be able to ``seed'' accretional growth and allow for the
<br>
formation of a single Moon if disk temperature and compositional
<br>
requirements are met. Our analysis demonstrates the need for more detailed,
<br>
higher resolution impact simulations.

<br>
<p>This paper reports the current status of my SPH simulations of the formation
<br>
of the Moon. Since the Moon has recently been found to have been formed
<br>
approximately 50 million years after the solar nebula itself was formed, I
<br>
have placed the lunar formation problem in the entire context of the
<br>
formation and early evolution of the solar nebula. This set of processes
<br>
remains controversial, and I have outlined what I believe to be the
<br>
essential physical processes involved. These start with the formation of
<br>
short-lived (now extinct) radioactive nuclides in a massive supernova. Then
<br>
follows the probable role of the supernova ejecta in triggering the collapse
<br>
of a core in a molecular cloud to form the solar nebula, and the injection
<br>
of the radioactivities into the collapsing cloud core. Most of the solar
<br>
nebula dissipates to form the Sun, and what remains becomes relatively
<br>
quiescent. Gas drag acting on interstellar grains and the dustballs formed
<br>
from them, due both to vertical descent to midplane and inward spiralling in
<br>
midplane, quickly causes growth of the solid materials to form
<br>
planetesimals. When these bodies reach the kilometer size range and beyond,
<br>
gravitational forces dominate the accumulation process. The accumulation of
<br>
the Earth requires of the order of 10(8) years. About half-way through that
<br>
process the giant impact occurs with the next largest accumulating body near
<br>
the protoearth. I have been simulating the giant impact using smoothed
<br>
particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with 100,000 particles. The simulations of
<br>
three of these runs are depicted in detail with a series of color images. It
<br>
is shown that conventional accumulation simulations that assume Keplerian
<br>
orbits and that merge bodies upon collision are misleading because they
<br>
cannot take account of tidal stripping nor of loss and gain of particles
<br>
during the accumulation. In addition, the large rotational flattening of the
<br>
protoearth renders the orbital motions nonkeplerian. The simulations that
<br>
are shown in detail have been followed for just over a week of real time,
<br>
and in that time the largest accumulating clump has reached about half or
<br>
more of the mass of the Moon and additional clumps have accumulated into
<br>
bodies in the range of 1 to 20 percent of a lunar mass. It is important to
<br>
note that although these runs have given very promising results, the
<br>
parameter space that could plausibly be associated with the giant impact is
<br>
not yet adequately explored.

<br>
<p>The depletion of moderately volatile elements in planetesimals and planets
<br>
is generally considered to be a result of removal of hot nebula gases. This
<br>
theory can be tested with Sr isotopes. The calculated initial 87Sr/86Sr of
<br>
the angrite parent body (APB), eucrite parent body (EPB), the Moon and the
<br>
Earth are significantly higher than the initial Sr isotopic composition of
<br>
the solar system despite the volatile-depleted nature of all of these
<br>
objects. Calculated time-scales required to accomplish these increases in
<br>
87Sr/86Sr with a solar Rb/Sr in a nebula environment are &gt;2 Myr for the APB,
<br>
<em>&gt;3 Myr for the EPB and &gt;10 Myr for the Moon. These times are more than an
</em><br>
order of magnitude longer than that expected for cooling the nebula in the
<br>
terrestrial planet-forming region and correspond to the period during which
<br>
most of the mass already should have been accreted into sizeable
<br>
planetesimals and even planets. Therefore, incomplete condensation of the
<br>
nebula does not provide an adequate explanation for the depletion in
<br>
moderately volatile elements. The data are better explained by a protracted
<br>
history of depletion via more than one mechanism, including processes
<br>
completely divorced from the earliest cooling of the circumstellar disk. The
<br>
Sr model ages are maximum formation ages of the APB and EPB and indicate
<br>
that these are most probably secondary objects. With independent estimates
<br>
of their minimum age, a time-integrated Rb/Sr can be calculated for the
<br>
precursor materials from which they formed. These are consistent with
<br>
accretion of the APB and EPB from objects that at one stage may have
<br>
resembled carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies in terms of volatile budgets.
<br>
At some late stage there were large losses of volatiles, the most likely
<br>
mechanism for which is very energetic collisions between planetesimals and
<br>
proto-planets that, in the case of the Asteroid Belt, have since been lost.
<br>
The same applies to the Moon, which presently has Rb/Sr=0.006 even though
<br>
the material from which it formed had a time-integrated Rb/Sr ratio of
<br>
~0.07, consistent with a precursor planet (Theia) that was even less
<br>
volatile element-depleted than the present Earth (Rb/Sr=0.03). The
<br>
time-integrated Rb/Sr of Theia is similar to the present Rb/Sr of Mars
<br>
(0.07). There is suggestive evidence of a similar time-integrated value for
<br>
the proto-Earth (~0.09). Therefore, prior to the later stages of planet
<br>
formation involving giant impacts between large objects, the inner solar
<br>
system may have had relatively uniform concentrations of moderately volatile
<br>
elements broadly similar to those found in volatile-depleted chondrites.
<br>
Correlations of the present Rb/Sr ratios in planets and planetesimals with
<br>
ratios of other volatile elements to Sr can be used to infer the
<br>
time-integrated composition of precursor materials. The time-integrated
<br>
inferred K/U ratios of the proto-Earth, as well as Theia, were ~20000, so
<br>
that early radioactive heat production may have been ~40% greater than that
<br>
calculated by extrapolating back from the Earth's present K/U. Higher C and
<br>
S bulk concentrations may have led to concentrations in proto-cores of
<br>
0.6-1.5% C and 4-10% S. These are significantly higher than those
<br>
anticipated from the degree of volatile depletion of the present silicate
<br>
Earth (~0.12% C, ~1.3% S). If the late history of accretion did not involve
<br>
large-scale re-equilibration of silicates and metal, the present core may
<br>
have inherited such high C and S concentrations. In this case, S would be
<br>
the dominant light element in the present core.
