<a href="mailto:jef@jefallbright.net?Subject=Re:%20Time.com%20asks%20you%20to%20vote%20for%20most%20dangerous%20country">jef@jefallbright.net</a> writes: I also realize I don't fully grok the concept.  
<br>
For example, I have been perplexed for years trying to understand how so many 
<br>
people adopt an arbitrary choice of sports team and behave as if &quot;their&quot; team 
<br>
winning is nearly a life and death matter.
<br>
<p>Yes Jef, I have noticed that tendency myself.  Some people seem motivated by 
<br>
having their favorite isms protected than in learning what is going on in the 
<br>
real world.  In a matter of life and death where thousands have died and more 
<br>
are threatened they even call those who oppose them terms that come down to 
<br>
meaning tacky and others describe folks that don't agree with them as sports 
<br>
fans.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They treat an email announcing that we would be entering the next 
<br>
interstellar dust cloud in roughly 10,000 years as appropriate to our list 
<br>
about the spike (actually I also think it is appropriate) but anyone that 
<br>
expresses a concern about a mad man halting our progress toward the spike as 
<br>
an inappropriate political intrusion.
