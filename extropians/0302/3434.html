</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;The greater danger to the U.S. than any direct harm that could be done by
<br>
Iraqi weapons is the harm that would result from disruption of the oil
<br>
supply. I've heard a number of people, including Saddam Hussein, make
<br>
accusations that Bush and his allies are concerned about oil. For the most
<br>
part, Bush, Blair et al seem to have avoided addressing the extent to which
<br>
an attack on Iraq is motivated by Iraq's oil. But I suspect that the fear of
<br>
disruption of the oil supply from that region is a major motivating factor,
<br>
given that Saddam has exhibited a willingness to attack neighboring
<br>
countries and a lack of ordinary prudence bordering on insanity. It's
<br>
politically unpopular to suggest that the main reason for attacking Iraq
<br>
would be to maintain control over the oil supply. But given that every
<br>
aspect of the U.S. economy (and the economy of every other nation that
<br>
depends on synthetic fertilizers, industrialized farming, modern
<br>
transportation, industrial production of goods, etc.) is heavily dependant
<br>
on a steady supply of relatively cheap oil, it seems that far more damage
<br>
could be done and ultimately more suffering and death inflicted on Iraq's
<br>
enemies by torching Iraq's oil fields than by setting off a dirty bomb or
<br>
turning lose some anthrax bacteria in a NY subway. The economy of the U.S.
<br>
is too fragile at the moment to easily weather a significant increase in the
<br>
price of oil.
<br>
<p>It does not matter whether or not the U.S. itself imports significant
<br>
amounts of oil from Iraq. A disruption in any segment of the world's oil
<br>
supply affects the entire global market. A large % of the current proven
<br>
reserves of oil (well over 50%, I believe) are located under Iraq and
<br>
neighborning countries.
<br>
<p>Pragmatically speaking, given where we are today, the question is whether an
<br>
attack on Iraq would decrease or increase the liklihood of a significant
<br>
disruption of the world's oil supply. If the decision is that attack would
<br>
be the preferable course of action, then delay will hurt the chances of the
<br>
hoped for outcome.
<br>
<p>My own position on this is that I hate the idea of war. I would support, and
<br>
fight in, a war to defend my own land, and I would support a war to defend
<br>
an ally under some circumstances. I think there's a lot I (and most people)
<br>
don't know about the present situation with Iraq. From the facts I do have,
<br>
I think an attack against Iraq is probably necessary at this point in order
<br>
maintain the U.S. standard of living (i.e. avoid major unemployment,
<br>
homelessness, soup lines, etc.) and that it has been inevitable for some
<br>
years. The only way to have avoided this would have been an internal revolt
<br>
in Iraq. I would never have wanted the U.S. to be in a situation where its
<br>
economy depends on the global oil supply. That this is a tragic situation
<br>
goes without saying. For many years I have done whatever was within my power
<br>
to support the development of alternative fuels, alternative agricultural
<br>
methods, and alternative life styles. I think we're moving in that
<br>
direction, but it hasn't happened fast enough, so here we are.
