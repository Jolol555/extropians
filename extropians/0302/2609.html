</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I was trying to point out your double discounting by doing the same
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt; again:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; p(.99)*u(.99m observers see 0 =&gt; .99m observers choose 0 =&gt; .99m
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; observers are rewarded &amp;&amp; .01m observers see 1 =&gt; .01m observers

<em> &gt;&gt; .01m observers see 0 =&gt; .01m observers choose 0 =&gt; .01m observers are
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; punished)
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Now compare this to what I wrote:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt; EU(choose 0)
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt;  .99*u(.99m R &amp; .01m P) + .01*u(.99m E &amp; .01m P)
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt;  =
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt;  .99*.98 + .01*(990-.01)
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt;  =
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt;  10.8701
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; Um... I just don't see where you get these numbers.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I got them by simple substitution from your own formula. Other than
</em><br>
<em> &gt; substituting some words with symbols, I just replaced &quot;.99m observers
</em><br>
<em> &gt; are rewarded&quot; inside .01*u(...) with &quot;.99m E&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Ah.  Okay, now I see where you got that from and *now* I understand where
<br>
your doubling is coming from.
<br>
<p>Before you see anything, the expected global utility is maximized by
<br>
following the rule &quot;always choose 1&quot;.  After you see 0, your local utility
<br>
is maximized by choosing 1, according with your *previous* expected
<br>
global utilities for what you would do *after* seeing evidence.  However,
<br>
on the next round, if you see 0 *again*, this time it will make more sense
<br>
to choose 0.  So if you see 0, you wish that you could tell all the
<br>
observers that you saw 0, in which case it would make more sense for
<br>
everyone else to follow the policy &quot;choose whatever number you see&quot;.
<br>
However, you can't tell them this.  Your expected local utility after
<br>
seeing evidence should always be consistent with your expected global
<br>
utility before seeing evidence.  After you see evidence your expected
<br>
global utility for policies will change, reflecting the new strategy that
<br>
you would feel best for the second round.
<br>
<p>I apologize for not making this clearer in my original reply.  The
<br>
original statement I was replying to was:
<br>
<p>[Wei Dai:]
<br>
<em> &gt; Note that if he did apply Bayes's rule, then his expected utility would
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  instead become .99*U(.99m people rewarded) + .01*U(.01m people
</em><br>
<em> &gt; punished) which would weight the reward too heavily. It doesn't matter
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in this case but would matter in other situations.
</em><br>
<p>[Eliezer's response:]
<br>
<em> &gt; Roughly speaking, if a Bayesian altruist-Platonist sees X=0, his
</em><br>
<em> &gt; expected global utility is:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; p(.99)*u(.99m observers see 0 =&gt; .99m observers choose 0 =&gt; .99m
</em><br>
<em> &gt; observers are rewarded &amp;&amp; .01m observers see 1 =&gt; .01m observers choose
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 1 =&gt; .01m observers are punished)
</em><br>
<p>This was a description of &quot;expected global utility&quot; in the sense of
<br>
describing what the observer thinks has *already* happened.  This is
<br>
a confusing and inconsistent sense of &quot;expected global utility&quot;, which I
<br>
used without thinking, and I apologize for it.  I should have called it an
<br>
&quot;outcome estimation&quot; or something like that.
<br>
<p>There is nothing inconsistent about having a global policy such that:
<br>
<p>1)  The expected global utility of all observers, before the evidence, is
<br>
maximized by the policy &quot;always choose 1&quot;.
<br>
2)  The expected local utility of a Bayesian observer, after the evidence,
<br>
is maximized by &quot;always choose 1&quot;.
<br>
3)  If a Bayesian observer sees 0, his outcome estimation for all
<br>
observers having followed the rule &quot;always choose 1&quot; will be less than vis
<br>
&quot;wistful hindsight outcome estimation&quot; for the rule &quot;choose what you see&quot;.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; BTW, I wish you would answer my question about global versus local
</em><br>
<em> &gt; utility.  Which one is the altruist-Platonist supposed to maximize, and
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  what's the purpose of the other one? If there is any misunderstanding
</em><br>
<em> &gt; on my part about what you're saying, getting this question answered
</em><br>
<em> &gt; should help correct that.
</em><br>
<p>You're supposed to maximize global utility.
