Anders Sandberg said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is revealing. Note that the nature article simply shows that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea doesn't work, but the newspaper (and subject line here) turns it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a danger message - it didn't work, so there is a risk!
</em><br>
<p>I have to disagree. It's not just that one more or less random attempt
<br>
failed to work. The reason it didn't work is revealing, showing a failure
<br>
mode that might almost inevitably occur in a whole class of GM
<br>
interventions.
<br>
<p>&lt; Once you know there is traffic from the crop to the wild you know you are
<br>
going to have a certain level of contamination through pollen. &gt;
<br>
<p>Note the comment at the end, trying to counter the perceived
<br>
scare-mongering:
<br>
<p>&lt; But a senior lecturer at Melbourne University's Botany School, Edward
<br>
Newbigin, said that although the rate was not zero, it was &quot;not going to be
<br>
measurable&quot;.
<br>
<p>While the foreign gene infected one seed in 16,000, only one seed in about
<br>
10,000 made it to a neighbouring non-GM field. This was a total rate of one
<br>
seed in 160 million, he said. &gt;
<br>
<p>I don't know how many seeds get sown in any given planting season. I can
<br>
imagine it might be more than that. And Dr Newbigin didn't say, `Oh, of
<br>
course they'll now abandon this failed approach.' He seems to imply that the
<br>
risk is acceptably small, which is only a relevant comment if the method is
<br>
likely to be used, no?
