<p>### I fully agree with you that dumping money on the corrupt rulers of the
<br>
poor people is highly counterproductive. In this context, American
<br>
occupation of Afghanistan (and later Iraq) offers the opportunity to give
<br>
real help, not to be diverted to nefarious schemes and Swiss bank accounts
<br>
(well, at least not all of it). Instead, basic education, sound fiscal
<br>
policy, support for the legal systems, protection of the free markets,
<br>
building of protected free trade zones in areas under US control, giving the
<br>
locals an economic stake in the benefits of the zones, expansion of the
<br>
orderly way of business across the land, access to information, and even, in
<br>
some special cases, limited humanitarian help, could eventually make a
<br>
difference.

<em>&gt; It's easy to wave one's hands and say &quot;schools, infrastructure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and investment&quot;, but, as the old saying goes, you can't teach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone how to fish by throwing a fishing pole his way, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if he'd rather do something else, like fight other tribes.
</em><br>
<p>### This is a slow process, to be sure.
<br>
<p>---------------
<br>
<em>&gt; I think that the crucial difference is that Japan and Germany
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were already extremely developed nations, and had the talent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to assimilate the habits of democracy.  Surely you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose that Afghanistan is as capable as they were.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### You are correct, I think, but we are not talking about transforming
<br>
Afghanistan into the new economic tiger. A small absolute improvement from a
<br>
low point can be a large improvement in relative terms, and a big change in
<br>
the likelihood of terrorism.
