<p><p>I've concluded that your opposition to protests is aesthetic. Which is fine,
<br>
and I respect that. Just like I have an aesthetic opposition to eating meat,
<br>
smoking pot, crossdressing, or drinking alcohol (though I invariably stick up
<br>
for the carnivores, potheads, transies, and drunks when some goody-two-shoes
<br>
moralist opens their big mouth).
<br>
<p>You basically don't seem to be denying that people have a right to *peaceably*
<br>
assemble. You're just expressing irritation that they chose to exercise
<br>
this right all the time. But you would never prevent them, certainly not
<br>
coercively, because that would go against your stated principles. So, all I
<br>
can say is, great! I wish more people felt the way you do.
<br>
<p>By the way, what do you think of more creative forms of protest? Such as
<br>
registering a domain name that sounds like the bad guys (whoever your bad
<br>
guys happen to be) and directing it to a site that makes fun of them (or
<br>
even pretends to be them and says outrageous things on their behalf)? Or
<br>
patenting/copyrighting something crucial to the bad guys' plan (which through
<br>
some oversight they forgot to nail down) and then prohibiting them from using
<br>
it? Or offering a reward to people who most correctly predict mishaps that
<br>
strike the bad guys? Or ratting them out to the press? Or luring them into a
<br>
lawsuit that they'll either lose or look like total grandpa-rapers if they
<br>
win?
