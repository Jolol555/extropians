Unfortunately if the public perceived a politician to be serving other
<br>
interests over American interests he would not stay in office very long. The
<br>
Kyoto treaty is a good example..The Senate was not going to ratify for any
<br>
reason, had the president pushed for it he would have been  killed at the
<br>
polls. States have always acted in there own best interest and it is very
<br>
naive to believe otherwise. If the rest of the world disagrees with American
<br>
action they will attempt to change things. This is a MAJOR flaw in the UN
<br>
charter. The security council does not give the great powers any real way to
<br>
solve there conflicts. And the General assembly gives the lesser powers far
<br>
to much say over the middle and great powers. The only real answer would be
<br>
to either get rid of the great power veto (impossible) or make votes in the
<br>
general assembly weighted (on population, wealth, military power, GNP..or
<br>
some combination) Or scrap the whole thing and start over.
<br>
I guess the point of my rant is....The world is, for now governed by power.
<br>
this is a fact. If we want things to change we can work at that but we
<br>
should not pretend that &quot;international law&quot; is really LAW. It can and has
<br>
changed many times over the last few centurys at the will of great powers
<br>
and will change to meet their needs many times in the future.
<br>

<br>
okay end of rant

<br>
If (US)American politicians only care for (US)American interests, 
<br>
they'll soon see, that the other 5.75 bio. humans have ways to make 
<br>
their interests clear. Be it diplomatic talks, demonstrations - or 
<br>
attempted airplane landings in large buildings.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; The UN in neither a world goverment nor is it democratic by any means.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you do not like that system then work to create a democratic world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state but don't believe it exists yet.
</em><br>

<br>
No, such a democratic world government doesn't exist yet, and perhaps we 
<br>
shouldn't want one, but there are such things as international treaties 
<br>
and one party - by far not the only one, but the most important - that 
<br>
ignores signed treaties is the US government. They broke bilateral 
<br>
treaties (Nicaragua, th US got even convicted for this), presented faked 
<br>
evidence to justify wars (Vietnam, Golf War I, Grenada), support 
<br>
dictators, war lords and even extreme religious fanatics and give a shit 
<br>
for freedom and democracy, whenever they have to choose between what is 
<br>
right and what serves US interests. Saddam Hussein got his Anthrax stems 
<br>
from Mr. Donald Rumsfeld himself.
<br>

<br>
It's no wonder we see no progress in non-military solutions of 
<br>
conflicts, when the most important factor for this process doesn't 
<br>
behave in a civilized way. The message to other regimes is clear, 
<br>
especially to those with a likewise &quot;flexible&quot; moral: Might makes right. 
<br>
Therefore, the US foreign policy of the last 40 years is one of the 
<br>
major forces _against_ more democracy and freedom.
