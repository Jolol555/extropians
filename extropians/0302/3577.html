Amara said in response to Spike
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is going on here? Perhaps your report is true, but isn't it too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much? Haven't you reached a point where you say to yourself: 'enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is enough'? For me that point, was 1 1/2 years ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shall we live in underground bunkers, fearful to breathe, fearful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walk, fearful to think ...? We hear 'War on Terrorism' used in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same fascist way as the 'War on Drugs' and now 'Weapons of XXXXXXX'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (fill in your latest fear) in the same way! Now on the transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lists are people speculating endlessly about how a handful of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremists can bring on the extinction of our species and we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatly change and alter our lives, accordingly, based on that fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Grand Security Theatre is doing a fine job at promoting that fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently, I'm not 'getting the message' that many of you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting, because I find myself more and more frustrated and sad to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see people's obsession with fearful thoughts. This is *your life*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you really want to spend it this way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I won't change my life for the latest government / media report of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scare-of-the-week, because it looks like more  Paranoia-Ville.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I refuse to buy into that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I can't express how strongly I agree with this. Like Amara I am both amazed
<br>
and disturbed by the obsession so many people have with an unattainable
<br>
ideal of &quot;safety&quot;, to the point that they are prepared to sacrifice
<br>
everything else to it., and by the way all sorts of people, many of them
<br>
powerful, feed and stimulate panic and paranoia. They at least have
<br>
ascribable motives but why has this mania got such a hold on the general
<br>
public, particularly (I have to say) in Anglo-Saxon countries?
