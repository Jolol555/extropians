<em>&gt; &gt; Many people agree with you on this, but a rising

<em>&gt; &gt; religious undertone is showing blind support to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government which is spreading (effectively)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propaganda,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The biggest questions that such problems pose for me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;why am I better informed than my neighbors&quot;, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do I account for judging my information and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be superior to theirs?&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Which is a valid reason for protesting instead of
<br>
something drastic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, in certain contrived hypothetical situations, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really do have objectively better information, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would act on it.  If I alone were talking to aliens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a regular basis, and had a good explanation as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why I was the *chosen* one, then there are all sorts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of things that I might do as a publicity stunt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my views well known.  I might chain myself to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; front gate of the White House, as Bobby Fischer's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mother is said to have done.
</em><br>
<p>sarcasm noted and all, the insane probably wouldn't
<br>
listen to your reasons against protesting.  I think
<br>
chaining yourself to the White House is illegal
<br>
although I'm not entirely sure.  In theory though, the
<br>
aliens could have told her to go out and kill as they
<br>
seem to do a lot, but luckily they suggested an action
<br>
that really didn't hurt anybody.  Good for the aliens
<br>
to believe in protesting instead of violence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now of course protests in reality often fall far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of any reasonable claims (animal rights activists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; storming Wendy's), but you claim it's about as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; uncooperative a thing as you can do in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; country.  If this is universally true, then how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you respond in this situation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I don't, on the other hand, have any special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then all I would do is vent my indignation by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action committees, writing letters to newspapers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magazines, attending local neighborhood meetings,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtually anything that still fell within Kant's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imperative.  (This, of course, is what I would also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefer that everyone else do.)  I would feel this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and restrain myself accordingly no matter how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I felt about something.
</em><br>
<p>Why are your methods acceptable and theirs not?  If
<br>
you look to the history of most of our lovely
<br>
democracies, not all the citizens have even been able
<br>
to get any recognition in these manners while their
<br>
rights were directly violated.  So are you just
<br>
referring to current society, and assuming that
<br>
everyone has a say?  Or were the civil rights protests
<br>
of the 60's obnoxious as well?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is extremely easy for people to suppose either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have special knowledge, or that they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality.  In their own minds this justifies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often up to and including violence.  You can easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine the chaos if we all took to the streets, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; barricaded the entrances to buildings, or simply lay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down in the driveways of the homes of those we felt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were on the wrong side of some issue.
</em><br>
<p>Not all protests take to the streets, there are many
<br>
on college campuses, not in the way of anyone.  I
<br>
recall at the University of Rochester numerous
<br>
protests against Sweatshop Labor since the Dean
<br>
refused to disclose information as to where the
<br>
University clothing was being made.  Never did they
<br>
interupt learning, never did they infringe on anyone. 
<br>
I was in the habit of being annoyed at all protests at
<br>
the time and was generally rather curt to them along
<br>
with various other protests on the campus.  But in
<br>
retrospect I'd have never known that they might have
<br>
had Sweatshop Labor produced nor would most of the
<br>
rest of the student body.  The Dean was forced to come
<br>
clean and they acheived an end good deed without
<br>
causing any grief except to the guilty party.  This is
<br>
undemocratic?
<br>
<p>Furthermore the protesters are generally the ones that
<br>
are non-violent and I thought it went without my
<br>
saying that violent protests are not acceptable.  Some
<br>
violence breaks out as does in any crowd, but then we
<br>
should be against large concerts too?  Mainly though,
<br>
it's those who try and suppress the protest that
<br>
create the violence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you do disturb traffic, or &quot;march&quot; in support of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various causes, how do you explain to yourself that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's all right for you to do this, but it wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be all right if everyone did it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This doesn't follow.  It wouldn't be 'alright' for
<br>
*everyone* to do most things that *some* people do. 
<br>
This of course doesn't happen so we maintain diverse
<br>
professions in the workplace and function as a nation.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Since it is legal to protest under certain
<br>
regulations, I assure you that the number of people
<br>
who are driven enough to protest already do, and to
<br>
assume otherwise doesn't make a whole lot of sense. 
<br>
The cause has to be strong enough for them to be
<br>
motivated to spend a lot of time, sometimes money,
<br>
sometimes risking dismissal from their job which pays
<br>
to feed their families.
<br>
<p>Disturbing traffic is no more than a petty
<br>
inconvenience for something that, you've so far not
<br>
convinced me otherwise, is a good peaceful check in
<br>
the democratic process.
