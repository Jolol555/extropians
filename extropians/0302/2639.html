<p><em>&gt; Lee said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Suppose I wonder whether there is such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation of my monitor---on which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm reading email---in my brain.  It turns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out that there is.  In our visual cortex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I forget whether it's V4 or what), there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed is such a literal mapping&lt;&lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, you’ve got it!  There is an actual scale model in our head!
</em><br>
<p>No, I guess that the closest I'm coming so far to your
<br>
position is a 2D picture of the 3D object.  You believe
<br>
that there is a little 3D model of the external object
<br>
somewhere in the brain.  Right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the monitor that you are consciously aware of, that you only think is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real thing in front of your real head is really simply this &quot;mapping&quot; in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain.
</em><br>
<p>Well, sorry to pick a nit:  but to be clear, when I refer
<br>
to &quot;my monitor&quot; I am not referring to what's in my brain.
<br>
I am referring to the glass and plastic item eight inches
<br>
from my brain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Everything you are consciously aware of is simply information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in your brain that represents the reality beyond our senses –
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not reality itself.
</em><br>
<p>Well, again, the words can mean either thing.  It's a
<br>
little bit like the puzzler &quot;do we see airplanes, or
<br>
do we see the photons reflected off the airplanes?&quot;
<br>
I like to say that we see the airplanes, but I know
<br>
what people mean when they say that we see photons.
<br>
<p>You are totally correct, of course, that the information
<br>
must be represented in my brain somehow.  It would be
<br>
VERY hard to find anyone on this list who'd disagree
<br>
with that.  Therefore, the point does not need to be
<br>
stressed IMO.  What you need to stress---and you do---
<br>
is that there is some kind of true-to-life model in
<br>
the brain, whereas I think that most people on this
<br>
list believe that the representation of objects in
<br>
the brain is much more subtle, the encoding much, much
<br>
more obscure.  For example, the pattern might even have
<br>
a dimension in time (I don't know that it doesn't), so
<br>
that when I visualize a cube it's like my brain is a
<br>
computer rapidly executing thousands of instructions
<br>
the way that a scanning beam on a TV does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The important thing is these conscious representations are more real than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality itself.  We know such exists more than we know reality itself exists.
</em><br>
<p>This is true, because, as materialists have realized for
<br>
centuries, my brain might be in a vat in Moscow for all
<br>
I know.  As to what is more &quot;real&quot;, my mental representation
<br>
or the physical plastic and glass in front of me, well, that
<br>
depends on how &quot;real&quot; is taken.  As a devout materialist and
<br>
realist, I consider the real monitor in front of me to be
<br>
certainly no less real than any representation I may have of
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They are made of qualia or the phenomenal properties of something in our brain –
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something traditional cause and effect science alone is unable to observe.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to discover and observe what/how these phenomenal qualities are requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effing. (see my paper at <a href="http://home.attbi.com/~brent.allsop">http://home.attbi.com/~brent.allsop</a>)
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I studied your paper last year.  I should look at it again
<br>
because I know that you were in the process of improving it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Monkeys eyes were held fixed while they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; steadily looked at a certain geometric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; figure (a grid or a triangle, I forget).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then they were instantly killed, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was found that this same grid was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; present, and spatially too, in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; visual cortex (at the back of their heads).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So it seems that we do have a picture in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our heads for visual information.&lt;&lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is new to me and frankly hard to believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The representations survive past death?
</em><br>
<p>Oh yes.  But this is a 2D representation, so don't
<br>
get too excited.  The scientists took a cross
<br>
section of some part of the visual cortex, and
<br>
when they stained that thin slice in the right
<br>
way, they got the picture of what the monkey
<br>
was looking at.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you have some references or something?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, no.  I read this perhaps 15 years ago in
<br>
some book.  But I remember quite clearly that
<br>
this is how it is.  Now, since we would hardly
<br>
be surprised to learn of a retinal image of
<br>
the geometric object, why should we be surprised
<br>
that this is relayed to the visual cortex in a
<br>
way that preserves its 2D features?
<br>
