</em><br>
<p>The friction I described was not WRT the swivel chair
<br>
itself, but WRT the ground.  Though, giving the right
<br>
bearings friction could serve the same purpose.  (Of
<br>
course, certain other bearings would not help.  Which
<br>
is which is left as an exercise to the reader; one
<br>
hint: if it looks like adding friction to the bearing
<br>
you're thinking of would prevent what I suggest,
<br>
that's not the bearing I mean.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;It is the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;effect that happens when a cat falls down and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;on its feet - by twisting its torso.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Twist to get at least one paw on the floor, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest of the body twists the other way...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The cat stretches her front paws and pulls in her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rear paws, twists her body.  The rear half turns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than the front half, since it has a smaller
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment of inertia.  Then she stretches out her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rear paws and pulls in the front, twists back the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other way.  Now the front turns more than the rear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Repeat process.  The cat can turn herself around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in freespace without touching the floor and without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violating any conservation of angular momentum laws.
</em><br>
<p>Problem: conservation of angular momentum when
<br>
stretching out or pulling in the paws of the
<br>
(spinning) front or rear half.  Angular momentum is
<br>
conserved across that action too, so as to conserve
<br>
the angular momentum of the whole feline, even if that
<br>
means merely pulling in or stretching out the paws
<br>
causes a change in rotation speed of that half of the
<br>
cat.  Ask any ice skater about pulling in arms while
<br>
spinning to spin faster, even without applying any
<br>
other torque.
<br>
<p>All forces are always in effect, so for all actions,
<br>
compute their effect on all forces.  Most seeming
<br>
loopholes in momentum result from failure to account
<br>
for the effect of some action on some force, but
<br>
reality never makes this oversight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;This new paper deals with the same idea and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;with a curved 4D 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;spacetime. By stretching and retracting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;limbs&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;of a body, Wisdom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;showed that one can &quot;swim&quot; through a curved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;spacetime...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This one stretches my imagination however.  spike
</em><br>
<p>As I posted, there exists a way to produce physically
<br>
measurable motion from this, given the rates
<br>
described.  Perhaps not much (at least, without a
<br>
*lot* of costly precision engineering), but still
<br>
measurable; therefore, I must demand physical evidence
<br>
before believing.  I can certainly imagine several
<br>
ways this could be true, though, but I know I can also
<br>
imagine the physically impossible.
