From: Lee Corbin [mailto:<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=RE:%20Bush%20budget%20has%200%20dollars%20for%20Afghanistan">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; I agree, but you are proposing to *change* the culture of an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire nation.  This sounds distantly familiar: a century ago 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was believed that war and poverty could be abolished by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educating people properly.
</em><br>
<p>There are in fact strong correlations between wealth, education, and
<br>
democracy.  Countries that have a high median standard of living are
<br>
almost all democracies.  
<br>
<p>In any case, Afghanistan has a democratically elected government
<br>
today.  That government has very little real power because it doesn't
<br>
have an adequate standing army or police force.  The military power is
<br>
the hands of the regional warlords.  Hamid Karzai asked the US to help
<br>
correct this and the US refused.  Why would we do that?  
<br>
<p>Regardless, I agree with you that building democracy in a place that
<br>
has never known it is a long hard job.  Nevertheless, it's the best
<br>
investment we can make in the future safety of the world and of the
<br>
United States.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's easy to wave one's hands and say &quot;schools, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure, and investment&quot;, but, as the old saying goes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can't teach someone how to fish by throwing a fishing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pole his way, especially if he'd rather do something else, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like fight other tribes.
</em><br>
<p>I just don't agree with this.  You can hire local workers to build
<br>
roads, a power grid, schools, and hospitals.  That sort of
<br>
infrastructure has a huge effect on a nation.  The process of building
<br>
it also pumps money into the economy in a more distributed and organic
<br>
manner than the IMF or World Bank can.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Currently the UN has a peace keeping force that patrols Kabul, the
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; capital of Afghanistan.  There are exactly 0 US personnel in this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; peace keeping force.  Hamid Karzai, the president of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Afghanistan, has repeatedly asked for a larger peace 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; keeping force that can  patrol the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entire country and help reign in the warlords.  His 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; requests have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; denied.  He has also asked for US assistance in training an Afghan
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; police force and Afghan military that would be under the control
</em><br>
of 
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the democratically elected government.  The US has denied these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; requests as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a *tough* question!  If you help a country too much, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even in fighting its rebels or its wars, it becomes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dependent. It does not develop the ability on its own, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is absolutely crucial.
</em><br>
<p>Goodness.  What we're talking about here are the basics.  We destroyed
<br>
a country and toppled its government.  Do we want to help train the
<br>
security forces of the new government or not?  Are we willing to help
<br>
keep the country stable until those security forces are ready, or not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may be that wiser heads than yours or mine have deemed it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible.  It's likely that at this stage of Afghan history 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the choice is either anarchy or cruel despotism.
</em><br>
<p>I have an alternate theory:  the people running US foreign policy are
<br>
myopic.  They're focused on the current threats (individual terrorist
<br>
groups) vs. the long term threat (terrorism in general and the
<br>
increasing ability of one person to kill millions).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the U.S. did do the right thing after World War II?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, then let's see what's different:  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that the crucial difference is that Japan and Germany 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were already extremely developed nations, and had the talent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to assimilate the habits of democracy.  Surely you don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose that Afghanistan is as capable as they were.
</em><br>
<p>Japan and Germany were both fairly rich, educated countries, and that
<br>
certainly helped in their reconstruction.  At the same time, Japan had
<br>
no democratic tradition at all.  In both places it took decades of
<br>
heavy US involvement to get the country back on its feet.
<br>
<p>Iraq also has a fairly well educated population.  It has natural
<br>
resources that can produce tremendous revenue.  What it will lack
<br>
after the US invasion is a democratic tradition, a force to guarantee
<br>
the country's stability while a new government is put in place, and a
<br>
huge amount of infrastructure that will have been destroyed in our
<br>
attack.   
<br>
<p>So in many ways, Iraq will be in a similar situation to Japan post
<br>
WWII.   Is the US willing to spend decades getting Iraq back on its
<br>
feet?  I hope so, but I've seen no indication of that so far.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
