<em>&gt; sells for ~$125.  One plugs the reader in and looks up the code on

</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.iequus.com/3100.asp?CatShort=CodeDef">http://www.iequus.com/3100.asp?CatShort=CodeDef</a>, right? What other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; features can a code reader (is a code scanner the same thing?) have?
</em><br>
<p>Yup, though some will just display the codes, while others will
<br>
actually have text info about what the codes mean. If you only have one
<br>
that displays the codes, you need a manual (generally $50-90) to tell
<br>
you what the codes mean. Milage may vary, you get what you pay for...
<br>
etc.  The Mac kit for the Visor has info on what the codes mean, though
<br>
not as much text as is in the manuals.
<br>
<p>Some scanners will provide real time performance data: horsepower,
<br>
torque, load percentages, governor settings, RPM, as well as pressure
<br>
and temperature of oil, coolant, fuel, and air, turbo boost pressure,
<br>
system voltage and knock volts, fuel injector delay times, and lots of
<br>
other things. Some will let you run tests of various sensors and
<br>
calibrate things like electronic ignition, injection response, etc.
<br>
<p>OBD II became the legally required code standard in the US as of 1996.
<br>
It was around since 1992 and a number of different vehicles in the
<br>
92-95 period use it. Most other vehicles still had their own
<br>
proprietary code systems, for which you can also buy code readers. Even
<br>
older vehicles, like my 87 Cherokee, have a dashboard response, giving
<br>
you x number of blinks of the dash lights for a given code. This is a
<br>
pretty normal interface technique. The ABS systems on the diesel buses
<br>
I work on use a similar system, while the engine computers use a code
<br>
scanner that also gives realtime performance data (MPC is the
<br>
manufacturer of this scanner), calibration info, trip and lifetime
<br>
data, etc.
<br>
<p>If you are a technoid, investing in some good diagnostic equipment may
<br>
be a fun and money saving extension of your computer hobby into the
<br>
garage. Most equipment sold today has interfaces to allow you to store
<br>
data to your home PC if you want to do more in depth analysis, if you
<br>
want to get into tweaking your engine performance, or if you just want
<br>
to store data for insurance/warranty purposes.
<br>
<p>What I'd really like to see is a wireless interface, so when you are on
<br>
the road (or someone else is on the road with the vehicle) and trouble
<br>
occurs, you can wirelessly interface with your home system for
<br>
telemetry download of data.
