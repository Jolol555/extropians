<p>Ah, but when Timothy Martin, VP of Tech Transfer Initiatives
<br>
at the NanoBusiness Alliance knows about JBrains and MBrains
<br>
(and I don't believe he is a ExI List subscriber), then one
<br>
has to acknowledge that the memes are a spreading.  [He made
<br>
a point of mentioning them to me at the recent IBF nanotech
<br>
investor conference.]

<p><em>&gt; What, you reckon the nearest post-Spike Culture nipped over to the in situ

</em><br>
<p>I'd probably lean in this direction.  If survey ships (or micro-sats)
<br>
detect &quot;controlled&quot; fire then one might have early warning of signs
<br>
of a technological civilization under development.  If one has been
<br>
around for a few hundred million years, then &quot;exploring&quot; for yet another
<br>
form of &quot;wild-life&quot; has to have gotten pretty boring.  The interesting
<br>
events will be when &quot;wild-life&quot; becomes sentient and subsequently when
<br>
they make the transition to relatively virtual entitites.  Of course
<br>
this is also the time at which they potentially become a threat to
<br>
the &quot;Galactic Club&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or did they drive the star
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Perhaps, but it seems easier to simply select a star that is likely
<br>
to be in the right place at the right time.  Unless the transitions
<br>
are really rare events, they probably have statistics on how long
<br>
the transitions are likely to take, so they can time their observations
<br>
to coincide with high information content periods.
<br>
<p>Now, Amara's comments extracting data from the paper seem to suggest
<br>
it is a fairly metal rich dwarf star (though I don't believe they
<br>
measured many metals of value from a nanotech perspective) so that
<br>
would suggest that star lifting is not taking place.  I think the
<br>
current theories predict that dwarf stars are probably low in excess
<br>
non-stellar material (planets, etc.).  So picking a dwarf star as
<br>
an observational base remains a questionable strategy (no material from
<br>
which to construct large mirrors).  But if its a partially enshrouded
<br>
star then classifying it as a dwarf is probably a stretch.  Astronomical
<br>
theory is still locked into the paradigm that the universe is most likely
<br>
&quot;dead&quot; and interpretations of the data reflect that bias.
