<br>
<p>Rafal,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that I understand what you are suggesting (Gee, that's 
<br>
chancy) let me try one more round of simplification.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always read that we got into this mess where we need laws to 
<br>
stop polluters because back in the 19th Century we made a conscious decision 
<br>
to protect manufacturing, mining, etc., by removing the power to sue from 
<br>
individual citizens.  Yep, we said those sectors of our economy were so 
<br>
important and needed encouragement to grow so bad that we wouldn't allow 
<br>
individuals to sue them for damages caused by pollution and who knows what 
<br>
else.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to stop pollution and other such offenses dead in its 
<br>
tracks why don't we restore the right of individuals to sue?  Without even 
<br>
getting heavy in our treatment can you imagine the average polluters reaction 
<br>
to having 50 different individuals haul him into small claims court for 
<br>
damage to their paint jobs either on their car or their house or maybe both?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know long before OSHA, manufacturers lived in fear of their annual 
<br>
inspection by their insurance company -- those guys could cancel your 
<br>
insurance or worse yet raise the premiums.  Many times the insurance guy's 
<br>
report took the form, &quot;you are doing X.  Correct that situation by doing Y 
<br>
and we won't raise your insurance premium by some astronomical amount Z.&quot;  
<br>
Things tended to get fixed.
<br>
