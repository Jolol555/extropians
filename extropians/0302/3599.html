<em>&gt; Why, I do thank you, Emlyn.  It is definitely a step in the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction to take my posts at face value.
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me, it was not really ok for me to start my post that way. My
<br>
apologies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think both Steve and Amara are talking about a more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general propensity in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people toward letting fear dominate their thinking, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus behaviour.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They're not talking specifically about mad survivalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, thanks.  This is perhaps something that quite a few of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us do agree on, after all, even though we approach it differently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and attend to different symptoms.  In my view, obsession with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safety surely must have always characterized some subset of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bell curve, and the very recent exhibitions of it---at a time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when truly we as individuals face fewer risks than ever before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---is simply caused by people not having enough ordinary things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to worry about.  My mother is perfect example.  She'll find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something to worry about, up to a level, as if meeting an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal need.
</em><br>
<p>We all know a lot of people like this - It's pretty normal, I think. And I
<br>
agree with you that we have less to worry about than ever before.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The problem is with a general trend toward a focus on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safety and security,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rising from fear, in the west. It comes out in all kinds of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funny little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ways, like people buying really big stupid cars (because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they feel safer),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or people deciding they need guns under their pillows, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even people taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a boring but career oriented job instead of doing what they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do with their lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You see, I look at exactly the other side of the coin.  To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some extent I have been guilty of all these examples you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posit.  Take cars, for example.  After I became a cryonicist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I become somewhat more cautious---but not to the degree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many cryonicists do.  I began, for another example, to begin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wearing my seat belt.  Who can really say with any authority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which risks are worth taking and which are not?
</em><br>
<p>Hey, I wear my seat belt too. It's convenient and seems to make a big
<br>
difference to something which, statistically speaking, is damned dangerous,
<br>
which is being in a motor vehicle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What we can do is observe general tendencies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The remainder of your examples are more typical of those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people of your ideological persuasion
</em><br>
<p>I hope you're not calling me a socialist! Grrr!  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; , whereas, were I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to detail them, my examples might typify mine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To take just one,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And now, we've had the growing example of the mother of all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scare campaigns,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beginning just after September 11 and continuing, with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased frenzy, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the present moment. The War of Terror is a war on a concept...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps you meant &quot;War on Terror?&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yup. My (frequent) spelling errors were indicative of me being a bit
<br>
overheated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  No matter.  From
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the perspective opposite to yours, there are these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people (who we call &quot;terrorists&quot;) who crash planes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into buildings, blow up ships, and would probably love
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to detonate an A-bomb in one of our Western cities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A lot of other people naturally resent this a great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal, and even hate them.  Sounds natural and predictable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me.
</em><br>
<p>I'm well aware of the common definition of terrorist. I think they used to
<br>
be called spies or enemy agents.
<br>
<p>Statistically speaking, you and I are so extraordinarily unlikely to be
<br>
harmed by a &quot;terrorist&quot; that it makes no sense to devote any personal
<br>
resources to the task of thwarting them, imo, and certainly it makes no
<br>
sense to let personal freedoms be impinged on to that end.
<br>
<p>Rationally, if we were to go after safety, we'd probably look a lot more at
<br>
heart disease, cancer and car accidents (I really should go googling to
<br>
check that these are something like the top causes of death).
<br>
<p>I think people get fixated on scary things (like terrorists, or
<br>
meningococcal, or meteor strikes), mostly to feed the need for worry.
<br>
Actually, I think we all have that, and that it is exacerbated by a chaotic
<br>
environment (ie: the increasingly complicated and excellent world in which
<br>
we live). I know I worry about things more than I rationally deduct that I
<br>
should.
<br>
<p>(An aside:
<br>
I'm not particularly fond of terrorists, per se. I must say, though, that I
<br>
believe (a) that they are disparate people fighting for disparate ideals
<br>
using disparate methods, (b) that they are defined as terrorists usually by
<br>
people who I wouldn't trust with my children, and (c) that I can't tell
<br>
often if the people fingered even exist, as I can only hear about it second
<br>
or third hand, and they are defined as shady (and so hard to measure) types
<br>
anyway. While I believe that certain organisations do exist (say hamas, or
<br>
the tamil tigers, or maybe al qaeda (undecided on that one)), I disbelieve
<br>
this very new and really quite useless notion of generic &quot;terrorists&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is a campaign asking us to look out for terrorists in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; midst, and report on them to the government, with the slogan &quot;Be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alert, not alarmed&quot; (which invokes thought processes like &quot;Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alarmed? Why? Is there something I might be alarmed about?  Is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really that bad? Oh shit!&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True.  But I'm not convinced that this has made people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be much more fearful than they would anyway.  The day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after 9-11, children (obviously studying how their parents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were taking this in) would ask, &quot;Are we going to die?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People overreact to tragedy due to innumeracy, at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the sense that too many really believe they're next.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps this is part of what Amara and Steve were criticizing.
</em><br>
<p>I find the opposite, that many people I talk to are more fearful now than
<br>
they were in the past (say early nineties, after the fall of the berlin
<br>
wall, for a baseline).
<br>
<p>In fact, from the increasingly hard to find libertarian presence here, and
<br>
the apparent replacement by jingoistic pro-war rhetoric, I think there is
<br>
much increased fear right here on-list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is my alternative explanation... some of us disagree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentally with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the defacto ideology of the modern west, that being a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture of fear and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negative individual obsession with unachievable personal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals like (total)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; safety and security.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had the above explanation for the focus on total safety:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a word, because we've never had it so good.  
</em><br>
<p>I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characterize the &quot;defacto ideology&quot; of the modern west as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an emphasis on individual benefit, a respect for property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (to the rejection of community ownership), and towards 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secularism.  &quot;Culture of fear&quot;?  When did that start, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would you say?  1920?  1960?  1700?
</em><br>
<p>More recently I'd say there is an emphasis on individual benefit, a
<br>
fetishisation of property, a reaction back toward religion, and a culture of
<br>
fear leading to an embrace of centralised authoritarian solutions to
<br>
perceived dangers.
<br>
<p>Also, for culture of fear I would put the date very recently. It coincides
<br>
with the particular conservative governments now in office in Australia and
<br>
the US, so for us started in the late nineties but really kicks in from 2000
<br>
onward. I also believe that it coincides with global economic downturn,
<br>
which is certainly not the fault of those governments as far as I am aware.
<br>
I do accuse them, however, of using the downturn as part of the meme of
<br>
&quot;these uncertain times&quot; (chaos =&gt; fear).
<br>
<p>I think it derives from further back, of course; I think we have had an
<br>
unfortunate tendency toward irrational fear for a long time. It's just that
<br>
recent governments have pushed all the buttons on purpose, because they
<br>
derive their ongoing support from the compliance brought by the fear. The
<br>
message is &quot;The world is fearful and the problems are too big for you. Only
<br>
your government can control the uncontrollable&quot;. 
<br>
<p>It is hard for me to say this last part... I think that perhaps this fear
<br>
comes from the social change away from a group oriented society, toward more
<br>
strongly enabled individuals. I wonder if the world really was simpler a few
<br>
decades ago, and if it is more difficult cognitively to live in it now, for
<br>
westerners. I wonder if some very basic memes that are strong especially in
<br>
this country, about unpredictability being mitigated by regulation and
<br>
central control, are the controls that are now being tweaked by the new
<br>
authoritarians. What I'm getting at is, maybe we are now technologically and
<br>
economically enabled to be able to have a more individualist, unregulated,
<br>
free society, but perhaps we aren't socially ready to embrace such? There
<br>
seem to be pervasive, semi-dormant statist memes underlying much of common
<br>
belief, which are ripe for the authoritarian's picking.
<br>
<p>To me, transhumanism partly is about acknowledging that if you are to have
<br>
an indivualist, freedom-oriented society which is the best it can be given
<br>
current/future technologies, you must have an ideology to support that,
<br>
which helps individuals manage freedom &amp; retain high trust in a
<br>
decentralised dynamic setting.
