So much anthropomorphizing:
<br>
<p>It all depends on the context within which you are making your comparisons.
<br>
<p>The sense of self is an illusion.  Science has begun to show that our own
<br>
sense of self, which seems to us continuous and central, and -- important --
<br>
is actually a result of multiple asynchronous fed-back processes.  One
<br>
emergent characteristic of these processes is what we think of as
<br>
consciousness or self-awareness.  What even most technophiles don't realize
<br>
is that this sense of self is under constant revision, with memories lost,
<br>
and sometimes replaced with various degrees of inaccuracy, emotions
<br>
changing, and even &quot;processing capability&quot; changing all the time.  The sense
<br>
of self is an illusion.
<br>
<p>What I find strange is that many people would generally agree with the above
<br>
paragraph, but then continue to think that preservation of this illusionary
<br>
&quot;self&quot; is an all-important goal.
<br>
<p>Philosophically-thinking (as opposed to evolutionarily-based
<br>
self-preservation thinking) perhaps we should value and promote the
<br>
&quot;extropy&quot; of an individual.  To value the knowledge and processes that lead
<br>
to greater growth, greater knowledge, greater &quot;intelligence&quot;, with little
<br>
regard, indeed perhaps a sense of &quot;good riddance&quot;, to the clinging notion of
<br>
self.
<br>
<p>This leads to the &quot;eighth level of identity&quot; which I've suggested in
<br>
relation to Lee Corbin's seven levels.
<br>
<p>On this basis, I strongly disagree with Lee's assertion that the life of an
<br>
85-year old is less valuable than that of a 15-year old.  In extropic terms,
<br>
I think carrying on the 85 year-old knowledge base (given the means to do
<br>
that)  is much more valuable.  In evolutionary-based terms, of course, it
<br>
feels right to value the 15-year old who can better carry on the genetic
<br>
legacy.

</em><br>
<p>I would suggest it's more useful to think of the &quot;I/mind&quot; as one *result* of
<br>
the calculation process taking place primarily in the brain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I would say that that is the more accurate way of speaking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but people (that we would agree with) can hardly be blamed for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying that computers feel or act when they mean the programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Well this has been obvious for me for a long time. But what freaked
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 'calculations' that is done in the flesh. And the flesh is only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; interface that allows us to experience the world.
</em><br>
<p>What is this &quot;us&quot; you speak of, Human?  It is confusing to think that
<br>
somehow &quot;you&quot; are separate from &quot;the world&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; And it is pretty hard to imagine mathematics that is self aware, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that must be the consequence.
</em><br>
<p>It's a stretch to say that mathematics can be self aware.  It might be more
<br>
useful to say that self-awareness is an emergent property of certain
<br>
information-processing systems, which can be described by mathematics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I don't go that far.  We pious platonists believe (in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very worst way that Brett Paatsch describes) that the mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities such as perfect triangles,
</em><br>
<p>Strange to *believe* in the existence of perfect triangles, when not even a
<br>
perfect straight line can be shown to exist anywhere in the physical
<br>
universe.  Sounds like a good example of an imperfect, but working,
<br>
hypothesis to me.
<br>
<p>the number seventeen, and all
<br>
<em>&gt; other mathematical ideas exist in a timeless platonic space;  less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figuratively and more concretely I describe this as a set of real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraints on possibilities in physical space.  (For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain physical objects (computers) when set to methodically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detonate a bomb when they find solutions for x^n + y^n = z^n
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for integers greater than two, will, it turns out, never explode.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not sure that I understand you here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So the amusing thing is that, given enough time, it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; possible to run a program with a pencil, on a piece paper, that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligence and conscience. If you stop writing the life ends and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you kill your 'creature'.
</em><br>
<p>What is this &quot;life&quot; you speak of, Human?  To make sense of this, you can
<br>
only refer to information processing. If the program is written such that it
<br>
has the feedback loops we call self-awareness, then it can be said to be
<br>
conscious, without implying anything mystical.  Implying that something dies
<br>
when the program stops running implies that there was something additional
<br>
there that &quot;died&quot;.  That sense of self &quot;dying&quot; is the illusion I mentioned
<br>
earlier. It's just a program running.  There is no &quot;self&quot; to die (in the
<br>
larger context.)
<br>
<p>(I understand what is conventionally meant by &quot;self&quot;, I live with this
<br>
illusion constantly *myself*, but we're seeing enough cracks in this theory
<br>
now, and understand enough of it's evolutionary basis, that I'm suggesting
<br>
we start getting used to a broader view, beyond personal identity (beyond
<br>
Lee's level 7)).
