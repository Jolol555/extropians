<p><em>&gt; Yes, [Crocker's] is the correct analysis.  Whether such individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights really can be read into the US constitution is another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing.  Assuming this is legitimate, however, a body such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Supreme Court is the appropriate institution to protect them.
</em><br>
<p>(we have *pairs* of Lee's, Russell's, Alex's, Damien's, Jef's
<br>
(though thankfully only one Spike (yet he must compete with the
<br>
book of the same name)), all of which makes first name familiarity
<br>
a thing of the past.  Let's hope that we don't have to start
<br>
indexing by DOB or national identity cards.)   :-)
<br>
<p>I agree that there is force in these arguments, and in
<br>
more ways that one.
<br>
<p>For me, the paradox perhaps relates to sovereignty.  I do
<br>
note that before 1865, the U.S. was often referred to as
<br>
&quot;these United States&quot;, and seldom as such afterward.  What
<br>
level of individual rights, then, is to be understood as
<br>
guaranteed by the American constitution?
<br>
<p>Russell referred to the uncertainty regarding &quot;whether such
<br>
rights can be read into the constitution&quot; or not, and this
<br>
is the eternal debate that perhaps separates even many
<br>
otherwise unanimous libertarians.
<br>
<p>The question is obviously linked to the related one of
<br>
sovereignty for clear historical reasons.  Yet another 
<br>
argument I will advance now is that in the case of the
<br>
U.S. perceptible gain is often obtained by running 50
<br>
experiments in parallel.  Why *not* allow more freedom
<br>
for states to do as they wish (within limits of course)?
<br>
If one focuses on his or her locality, what exactly are
<br>
the laws are a thousand miles  should be of little
<br>
importance.  &quot;Think locally, act locally&quot; say I.
<br>
<p>Then there is the argument I made that was not addressed,
<br>
but which was referred to by Ron.  Namely the sincere
<br>
question,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we believe that nine men and women sitting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Washington can pass laws and rules that apply
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equally well to a small tightly-knit Hasidic community
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on Long Island, to the entire Appalachian South, or to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communities in southern California?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And how can it be maintained that *they* should be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trusted to make this kind of decision, but the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communities and states at lower levels cannot be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so trusted?)
<br>
<p>To be concrete, suppose that a small Mormon community in
<br>
Idaho collectively finds abortion incredibly repulsive and
<br>
abominable.  What is so heinous about them passing local
<br>
laws that do not permit doctors to set up business performing
<br>
abortions?  It seems to me to be none of our affair anyway.
