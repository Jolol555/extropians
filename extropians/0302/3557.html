<p>I agree with you - both are antiamerican, but only France will build Europe
<br>
as Superpower.  EU together with EasternEurope countrys will be the bigest
<br>
economic power in the world (maybe not long when we will not reform the
<br>
economy). France need us, Eastern Europeans, only to realize their silly
<br>
imperial dreams. But majority of Germans will build completely other Europe,
<br>
maybee a little against US, but not as a military Superpower.  Only 48%
<br>
Germans will Europe as Superpower, in France - 91% (German Marshall Fund, in
<br>
FAZ). German-French alliance has no future.  In the discussion about
<br>
strategy and future of Europe France will stay allone. I can't imagine
<br>
Joshka Fischer (friedly) will agree with Chirac (aggression) about aims of
<br>
Europe. Majority of European will create the powerfull Union only in economy
<br>
and culture.  It is OK.
<br>
But what about security? Should american citizens continue to pay for our
<br>
security? No.
<br>
I think we should finance and enlarge NATO as the army of the democratic
<br>
world. NATO should invite Russia, S.Korea, Japan, Australia, India, new
<br>
democratic Iraq etc.  &quot;Connectivity&quot; of the world will grow.  We can build
<br>
on this way peacefull Europe, contribute to the world security and stay
<br>
secure. We will haven't dangerous conflicts not only inside of the
<br>
transatlantic community but maybe worldwide. I think Europe as a military
<br>
superpower is the very bad idea.
<br>
<p>And then?
<br>
We will be well prepared for singularity and can control our growing global
<br>
brain (and compete in the cosmic evolution).
