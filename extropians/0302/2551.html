### It would be interesting to find out if any New York-type cities were
<br>
ever built *after* cars became widely available, in areas with sufficiently
<br>
cheap land.
<br>
<p>As I said before, New York, and other high-density cities were formed by the
<br>
logic of industrial and economical development in the age of the horse buggy
<br>
and snail mail. They are the infrastructure from a bygone era, adapted to
<br>
technologies of one hundred years ago, and can be best explored using
<br>
antiquated methods of transport. However, suburbs are effects of the
<br>
interaction between today's technological possibilities and innate human
<br>
preferences.
<br>
<p>Tooby and Cosmides include an essay in the &quot;Adapted Mind&quot; about human
<br>
esthetic preferences. Apparently, most humans prefer environments with the
<br>
appropriate balance between being enclosed and having unobstructed view,
<br>
environments which promise hiding places from predators, good lookouts, an
<br>
element of mystery, appropriate seclusion and the right amount of closeness.
<br>
While there are great interindividual differences, the teeming metropolis of
<br>
the Industrial Age seems to violate our most cherished desires - for space,
<br>
safety, greenery, and absence of noise. The flight into the suburbs is an
<br>
expression of these desires, and was enabled first by the car, now even more
<br>
so by the Internet.
<br>
<p>It is true that the metro makes New York less unbearable, but apparently,
<br>
for many if not most people, a quiet, village-like settlement, with abundant
<br>
greenery, large, quiet, comfortable houses, and easy access using narrow,
<br>
meandering roads connected to high-speed highway networks and G-bit data
<br>
lines, is what good Mother Nature made us for.
