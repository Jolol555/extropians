<em>&gt; Looks to me like Taxifornia is denying gun ownership
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights to U.S. citizens who are illiterate, the blind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I need to think about that one), those who can read but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not English.  So in what sense is it legal to require a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; written test to own a gun?
</em><br>
<p>The Second Amendment says &quot;well regulated militia&quot;, with the 'militia'
<br>
being the whole of the people, according to George Mason, James
<br>
Madison, and other founding fathers. In legal dictionaries of the day,
<br>
&quot;well regulated&quot; did not mean statutorily restricted, it meant 'well
<br>
trained and drilled'. On this basis, according to the Constitution,
<br>
provided all *citizens* are given the opportunity to obtain such
<br>
training and drilling, they can be reqired to pass some examination to
<br>
determine whether the individual has been 'well regulated'.
<br>
<p>That being said, any military veteran with a form DD214 should be
<br>
exempt from such tests, since they could not be veterans if they had
<br>
not received training in excess of any that a state may require of a
<br>
civilian.
<br>
<p>I might mention that in colonial and post-Revolution America, most
<br>
every community had regulations *requiring* that all residents bring
<br>
their firearms to church on Sunday so that they may participate in
<br>
drill after church, with fines for those who did not do so.
<br>
<p>Even those who registered as concientious objectors in time of war were
<br>
not exempt from such peacetime requirements in many cases.
