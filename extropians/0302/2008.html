<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;The &quot;hydrogen economy&quot; has been promoted for years by environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; activists and alternative-energy gurus like Amory Lovins. But hydrogen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is not a source of energy, something which hydrogen advocates either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't understand or refuse to acknowledge.
</em><br>
<p>They, esp. Amory Lovins, are simply unrealistic -- he has proposed using
<br>
off-peak hydroelectric power to produce H2 -- that doesn't come anywhere
<br>
close to solving our energy supply problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AFAIK, H2 is more promoted as the newe energy &quot;currency&quot; in a network of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many differnt energy sources. The technology for storage and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transportation is well-known, quite simple and relatively safe.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that transportation (by ground) is expensive.
<br>
It needs to be transported by pipeline.  That requires an
<br>
entirely new pipeline system (comparable to the existing
<br>
natural gas pipeline systems in the U.S., Russian and Europe.
<br>
The existing pipeline system wasn't designed to transport H2.
<br>
One problem for example is that H2 gets absorbed by metals and
<br>
embrittles them.
<br>
<p>The figure I've seen for duplicating the existing natural gas
<br>
pipeline system in the U.S. is circa $100 billion.  One needs
<br>
a market for that before one would begin to contemplate building
<br>
the pipeline system.  One can't create a market without having an
<br>
energy supply.  Its a chicken and egg problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Methane, produced from bio mass can, if not used directly, be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catalytically cracked (Ni and steam) to H2 and CO (which can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be burned to CO2).
</em><br>
<p>This is the right approach -- to use methane (natural gas) as
<br>
the energy carrier in the existing pipeline systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since the CO2 from bio mass energy had been taken from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the air by the plant before, this process is CO2-neutral to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment.
</em><br>
<p>Precisely.  One could &quot;reform&quot; the mathane into H2 either at filling
<br>
stations or within automobiles themselves.  Though the cars could
<br>
burn the methane directly with small adjustments.  The only reason
<br>
to reform it might be to reduce NOx emissions.
