<em>&gt;Osama Bin Laden (or one of his surviving assistants) announces that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a change of tactics he will stop bombing innocent civilians and instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be putting a US$ 1 Million bounty on anyone who takes out a member

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think I would have to say this would be an act of war. I suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it would be far more provacative as an action that killing a few thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;innocents in a &quot;traditional terrorist&quot; action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suspect we would look seriously at nuking anyone who tried this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why should our enemies not take the same attitude about bounties
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if the US offered them for Hussien and his crew?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Just a thought,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brian
</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he did this, *and* really stopped civilian bombings, I would be 
<br>
overjoyed.  Mind you, I disagree about the likelyhood of us nuking them, 
<br>
especially since they would be surrounded by large groups of civilians, 
<br>
which would of course change my view of the situation, but I can't help but 
<br>
view Al Quaeda changing tactics from job lot murder of civilians to 
<br>
military personnel and high ranking civilian officers as anything but a 
<br>
vast improvement in general.  I still would never forgive them for 9/11, 
<br>
and a completely new group that did this would still be enemies of the US; 
<br>
but I would be willing to call them Guerillas rather than terrorists, and 
<br>
would have no problem with officials negotiationing with them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regards to acts of war, there are really just three lines to 
<br>
cross: violations of the Geneva Conventions, terrorism (indiscriminate 
<br>
targeting of civilians), and the use of weapons of mass 
<br>
destruction.  Though we should fight back against any attacker, its 
<br>
important that we also encourage enemies to stay on the correct side of all 
<br>
three lines.
