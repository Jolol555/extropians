----Original Message-----
<br>
From: Hal Finney [mailto:<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=RE:%20WHOA!%20Fission%20Energy%20Phenomena">hal@finney.org</a>] 
<br>
<p>&quot;Apparently there is some controversy about this Hafnium nuclear-decay
<br>
phenomenon.  Lawrence Livermore National Lab tried and failed to
<br>
reproduce the effect in 1991, according to this press release,
<br>
<a href="http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/06news/NewsReleases/2001/NR-01-08-05.html">http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/06news/NewsReleases/2001/NR-01-08-05.html</a>.
<br>
I don't know the current state of the controversy.&quot;
<br>
<p>From that paper - &quot;In other words, the X-ray irradiation did not decrease
<br>
the time it takes for hafnium to decay; a result that Becker and the team
<br>
claim is consistent with nuclear physics&quot;  
<br>
<p>My knowledge is limited on this subject, but I was under the impression that
<br>
the nucleons of Hafnium could be excited to higher energy levels and remain
<br>
stable and coaxed to release their stored energy as gamma rays when hit with
<br>
X rays.  The nucleonic excitation has nothing to do with the weak nuclear
<br>
radioactive decay of the host atom.  So what does it matter that the LLNL
<br>
found that the X-Ray irradiation did not 'decrease the time it takes for
<br>
hafnium to decay&quot;  It shouldn't, it should, however, decrease the time it
<br>
takes for the excited nucleons to decay to a non-excited state!  Did these
<br>
researches just misunderstand what was going on here?  Or am I just entirely
<br>
confused?
