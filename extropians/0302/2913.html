<p>My general argument is that you don't go to war against someone unless you
<br>
have a good reason to. I haven't seen a single argument supporting going to
<br>
war with Iraq that didn't look plain stupid.
<br>
<p>Someone tell me, poor silly fool that I am, why anyone would want to go to
<br>
war with Iraq?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also totally reject any notion that the present government of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; hate us have or need legitimate reasons.
</em><br>
<p>It still begs the question of why you would want to go to war in the first
<br>
place.
