<p>I don't understand why you're bringing a second round into this. There is

no second round in either of the thought experiments.

</em><br>
<p>Ok, but why do you bring it up since there is no second round? Does 
<br>
imagining a second round help you make a decision in the first and only 
<br>
round?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This was a description of &quot;expected global utility&quot; in the sense of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Outcome estimation doesn't make sense either. See last paragraph below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is nothing inconsistent about having a global policy such that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  The expected global utility of all observers, before the evidence, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximized by the policy &quot;always choose 1&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  The expected local utility of a Bayesian observer, after the evidence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is maximized by &quot;always choose 1&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I'm still confused what what you mean by &quot;global&quot; versus &quot;local&quot;. Do you
<br>
mean that for any given observer-moment and possible course of action,
<br>
there are two different expected utilities, one global and one local. Or
<br>
are you using them to denote the expected utilities of two different
<br>
observer-moments? At first I thought it was the former because you gave
<br>
different global and local utilities to the same observer-moment, but then
<br>
you said that what you gave for &quot;global utility&quot; was actually &quot;outcome
<br>
estimation&quot; so now I don't know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3)  If a Bayesian observer sees 0, his outcome estimation for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observers having followed the rule &quot;always choose 1&quot; will be less than vis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;wistful hindsight outcome estimation&quot; for the rule &quot;choose what you see&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Suppose you see 0. At this point it's not too late to change your mind and
<br>
guess 0. If you did, then that would be equivalent to having the rule
<br>
&quot;choose what you see&quot; to begin with. So if you're feeling regret about
<br>
&quot;always choose 1&quot;, why not change your mind? Obviously you should not be
<br>
feeling regret since you haven't done anything yet, therefore the &quot;outcome
<br>
estimation&quot; formula you gave must be wrong.
<br>
<p>Eliezer, how about we switch roles for a bit. Let me tell you the decision
<br>
making process I would use in more detail, and you can tell me where you
<br>
disagree.
<br>
<p>First, for each observer-moment and course of action (i.e., policy or
<br>
rule), there is one expected utility. Each observer-moment should choose
<br>
the course of action with the greatest expected utility. Expected utility
<br>
of a course of action is defined as the average of the utility function
<br>
evaluated on each possible state of the multiverse, weighted by the
<br>
probability of that state being the actual state if the course was chosen.
<br>
<p>(Actually this is a drastic simplication of what I'm actually proposing,
<br>
but it's sufficient to deal with this thought experiment. If you see any
<br>
problems with this definition, please read
<br>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/<a href="mailto:everything-list@eskimo.com?Subject=Re:%20Parallel%20Universes">everything-list@eskimo.com</a>/msg03812.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/<a href="mailto:everything-list@eskimo.com?Subject=Re:%20Parallel%20Universes">everything-list@eskimo.com</a>/msg03812.html</a> where
<br>
you'll get the full proposed definition of expected utility in the
<br>
multiverse context.)
<br>
<p>There are three observer-moments in the thought experiment: (A) you before
<br>
seeing any printout, (B) you that sees 0, and (C) you that sees 1. They
<br>
each make their own decisions but all of the decisions will be consistent
<br>
with each other (since they are after all the same person). So A has three
<br>
possible courses of action:  (A0) always choose 0, (A1) always choose 1,
<br>
and (A2) choose what you see. B has two possible courses of action: (B0)
<br>
choose 0, (B1) choose 1. C has (C0) choose 0, (C1) choose 1.
<br>
<p>Discard A0 and C0 first since they're obviously wrong. Then for A:
<br>
<p>EU(A1) = P_A(X=0)*U(1m P) + P_A(X=1)*U(1m E)
<br>
= .5*(-1) + .5*1000 = 499.5
<br>
<p>EU(A2) = P_A(X=0)*U(.99m R &amp; .01m P) + P_A(X=1)*U(.99m E &amp; .01m P)
<br>
= .5*(.99-.01) + .5*(990-.01) = 495.485
<br>
<p>So A should choose A1. This part I think we both agree on. I'll go into 
<br>
more detail for B:
<br>
<p>EU(B1) = P_B(X=0)*U(state of the multiverse if B chooses 1 and X=0) + 
<br>
P_B(X=1)*U(state of the multiverse if B chooses 1 and X=1)
<br>
<p>EU(B0) = P_B(X=0)*U(state of the multiverse if B chooses 0 and X=0) + 
<br>
P_B(X=1)*U(state of the multiverse if B chooses 0 and X=1)
<br>
<p>What's the state of the multiverse if B chooses 1 and X=0? C is certain to
<br>
choose 1. So if B chooses 1 and X=0 then 1m observers get punished.
<br>
And if B chooses 1 and X=1? Since C chooses 1 then 1m observers gets
<br>
rewarded extra. So:
<br>
<p>EU(B1) = P_B(X=0)*U(1m P) + P_B(X=1)*U(1m E)
<br>
<p>If B chooses 0 and X=0, B gets rewarded and C gets punished, and B has
<br>
measure .99m and C has measure .01m, so it means .99m R &amp; .01m P. If B 
<br>
chooses 0 and X=1, B gets punished and C gets rewarded extra, and B has 
<br>
measure .01m and C has measure .99m, so it means .01m P &amp; .99m E. So:
<br>
<p>EU(B0) = P_B(X=0)*U(.99m R &amp; .01m P) + P_B(X=1)*U(.99m E &amp; .01m P)
<br>
<p>Do you agree so far?
<br>
<p>Now what should P_B(X=0) and P_B(X=1) be? If B applies Bayes's rule and 
<br>
make them .99 and .01, then he's going to choose B0, which we've agreed is 
<br>
wrong and also inconsistent with A's decision. So they must remain .5 and 
<br>
.5.
