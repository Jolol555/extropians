</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think Kai is saying that by driving, you are polluting, polluting
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill people.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Almost right. Those rules mentioned were not made to save someone against
<br>
his own will, but to save someone against the stupidity of others. Some
<br>
smart aleck may think that 30mph within cities is to slow for a freedom
<br>
loving person like him, ignoring that this rule wasn't made to annoy him,
<br>
but to protect the others. A society without any such rules would break 
<br>
down soon because of the effort for everyone to protect himself against
<br>
others and their &quot;freedom&quot;.&quot;
<br>
<p>I understand what you are trying to convey (I think) and would be in
<br>
tentative agreement with it, except that it bugs me just a little.  Because
<br>
by this reasoning you are essentially punishing someone for doing things
<br>
that will make him more likely to injure people, instead of punshing them
<br>
for actually injuring them.  You are assuming guilt before a crime is
<br>
committed.  If it is wrong to run over and kill people, then punish people
<br>
for doing that.  But driving erratically or too fast is not killing people,
<br>
until you actually run over and kill people.  In which you will be tossed in
<br>
jail for rediculous lengths of time deservingly, and serve as a reason to
<br>
others why one should not drive fast or erratically.  If a person hits and
<br>
kills someone while drinking and driving, then they should be found guilty
<br>
of 2nd degree murder.  In fact, one could argue that driving and killing
<br>
anyone through an act of negligence could be considered 2nd degree murder.
<br>
Not something punishable by 6 months suspended licenses and 2 years
<br>
probation.  Regardless of what stupid thing you did that killed someone, you
<br>
still killed them from your own actions, you are still a murderer.  How is
<br>
driving rapidly and recklessly morally indifferent than waving a gun around
<br>
and firing randomly.  If you hit and killed someone with your gun, you would
<br>
be a 2nd degree murderer, would you not?  But if you brandish an automobile
<br>
recklessly and kill someone you get probation.  Why is it less bad to kill
<br>
someone through alchoholic impairment and negligence then it is to kill them
<br>
willfully?  This attidude is what perpetuates the acceptance of negligence
<br>
and necessitates the existence of nanny states to limit negligence through
<br>
'too many' laws.  The fact that we distinguish willfull killing through
<br>
planning from accidental killing through negligence (with proportionally
<br>
less punishment) is what allows so many people to be accidently killed
<br>
through negligent behavior.  How many drunken drivers would there be if they
<br>
served 25 to life for 2nd degree murder?  I am quite sure, at the very
<br>
least, none of them would be repeat offenders.  If you could be tossed in
<br>
jail for half your life for driving too fast through a city and hitting and
<br>
killing someone, would you drive that fast?  
<br>
<p>&quot;So, too few (or wrong) rules is bad, too many rules is also bad. A middle
<br>
course is the answer, not black, not white. &quot;
<br>
<p>I don't think you have adequately shown that 'too few' rules would be bad,
<br>
or worse than 'a middle road' or 'too many'
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is the same guy, however, who thinks the possibility of a nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactor killing millions is worse than the 3 million people who die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every year from the pollutants from the combustion of fossil fuels.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I still miss any serious facts that support your claim.&quot;
<br>
<p>Since I have repeated multiple times the statistic that nearly 3 million
<br>
people die every year from atmospheric pollutants from fossil fuel burning
<br>
plants and you suggest I have not presented any 'serious facts' to support
<br>
my claim, I can only wonder why you don't consider this staggering number of
<br>
deaths to be a serious fact?  You must have an internally consistent,
<br>
rational, and logical reason why you prefer continued fossil fuel burning in
<br>
the face of these deaths over nuclear, and I am really trying to get the
<br>
information to understand your personal rationalization of that, but right
<br>
now, I am just completely confused.  Is there a reason why you don't see
<br>
that as a good argument in favor of nuclear?  Do you dispute those figures
<br>
perhaps?  Do you feel that a) more are dying every year from nuclear or b)
<br>
more would die every year (or total) from nuclear power infrastructures?  
<br>
<p>As I have said (parroting myself again) approx 3 million people die every
<br>
year from atmospheric pollutants specifically released from the combustion
<br>
of fossil fuels in power plants.  Thousands of others die in coal mining
<br>
accidents, natural gas explosions, carbon monoxide inhalation, radon buildup
<br>
from stricter energy requirements, etc. etc.  Every time I see a natural gas
<br>
line running into a resteraunt and hissing I am disgusted.  
<br>
<p>So I must conclude that you feel nuclear power would kill more than 3
<br>
million people per year if our infrastructure was based on that.  That's the
<br>
only way I can see your opposition as being reasonable.  Is that the case?
<br>
I would be interested in reading the material you must have read that led
<br>
you to this risk calculation.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey.
