<p>That's a scientific fact. But you don't think you'll ever be in danger 
<br>
from iraqi chemical weapons, do you? There are so many unanswered 
<br>
questions: Is there really VX (or other B/C weapons)? Where? How much? 
<br>
How shall it be used and against whom? Do you expect Saddam to ship it by 
<br>
boat or will he charter an airplane, because he has no air force left?
<br>
<p>Okay, maybe rockets. He could really reach his neighbors, but he knows 
<br>
well what would happen in this case. Even a single rocket launch would 
<br>
buy him the total demolition of what he wants to preserve: Power, wealth 
<br>
- and his life. _If_ there are WMDs, they serve just one interest: To 
<br>
drive the prize for a prospective enemy higehr than bearable. In other 
<br>
words: _If_ Saddam produces WMDs, he does so to some extend _because_ of 
<br>
the military threat from the US. (As we've learned, a state is safer 
<br>
against US/UN invasions, the more dangerous weapons it has.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And you think Iraq is now telling the truth, Kai
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that Iraq is telling the tuth, but I also doubt the &quot;clear 
<br>
and present danger&quot; babble of Mr. Bush.
<br>
<p>I say send more inspection teams, do more surveillance, form a real 
<br>
international coalition, force Iraq to accept human rights, free press, 
<br>
free political activities. But _not_ by a massive attack and military 
<br>
invasion, but by one step after another, full publicity and no chance for 
<br>
arab extremists and terrorists to use the Iraq incident for their own 
<br>
business - e.g. get their hands on the leftovers of any WMD fabrication.
<br>
<p>If an invasion is necessary, make it a silent invasion of inspection 
<br>
teams, human rights supervisors, international relief organizations, etc. 
<br>
until the Iraq regime can no longer maintain its pressure on the people. 
<br>
If Saddam refuses to comply, use restricted force against the spots he 
<br>
denies access to. Even if this requires years, it will be cheaper and 
<br>
more under control than a war at this time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Very soon it will be as obvious to the man on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; street as it is already obvious to every intelligence agency in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world
</em><br>
<p>Pardon, the MI-6 (that's the secret service of Mr. Bush's best ally) not 
<br>
only lacks any evidence, but also got so fed up with the fabricated 
<br>
evidence (cf. that student homework) of Mr. Blair (that's the boss of 
<br>
that secret service), that they informed the press about this[1]. 
<br>
<p>The CIA is neither convinced that Saddam _has_ significant amounts of 
<br>
weapons, nor that he is going to attack the US. Instead of asking for 
<br>
real evidence, the White House presses the analysts to produce PR for Mr. 
<br>
Bush's already made decision[2].
<br>
<p>In other words: Do you have any proof for your claim?
<br>
