<em>&gt; 2. I was reading a suggested reason for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disaster today. One possibility was the peeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the &quot;thermal protective tiles&quot; on the left wing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the shuttle. My concern is that we are still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using, from a materials-science point of view,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nomex or nextel tiles. This is ridiculous (if true)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and speaks poorly of the aerospace firms that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have continued to maintain the shuttles. Glue-on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thermal tiles are definitely not the way to go,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially if the article I just read is proven true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are metal alloys that would add weight,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but serve even better for heat resistance. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't even spoken about advanced concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aerospace planes. These need to be focused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on, and the teams that decide who builds what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept needs to be redone.
</em><br>
<p>I've always been skeptical of the tiles for another reason.  The system
<br>
looks like it's designed to fail, since it has to many points where
<br>
catastrophic failure can happen and from a maintenance/repair/inspection
<br>
point of view looks like a nightmare.  I'm surprised fatal failures
<br>
didn't happen earlier in this area.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. Visionary Physicist, Freeman Dyson (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposed to other physicists who merely collect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; checks) notes that certain big projects supported
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by governments, tend to be projects where one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot afford to fail. The Shuttle is but one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these, the dirigibles of the 1920's and 1930's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were another. One of the reasons, Dyson gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the triumph of the airplane over the dirigible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that planes were robust, and their technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced extremely rapidly, compared to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dirigible. Dyson would conclude (me thinks) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we need a space program that lends opportunity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for lots of experimentation for getting safely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbit and back.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  This is generally the market vs. government here.  Early
<br>
aircraft technological advances were, to a large extent, decentralized
<br>
and small firms competing.  Space technology, sadly, is massively
<br>
government funded -- save for a few small companies (XCOR comes to mind)
<br>
that might bring in a wave of development like happened early last
<br>
century with airplanes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We need something that is a more reliable workhorse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This Shuttle takes lives every time it fails. This is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of bull puckey we, as tax payers, should not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to abide.
</em><br>
<p>The Saturn Vs seemed to fit that bill, if you ask me.  A revamped design
<br>
of them might provide something better than the current Shuttle program
<br>
in terms of no frills chemical rocketry.  I know we've discussed this
<br>
issue here before, but I'd like to explore this idea in more depth and
<br>
run some numbers to see if this is worth doing.  Anybody with me here?
<br>
<p>Cheers!
