<p>Of course, agree on all points.  But Amara's post went
<br>
off on a tangent that I hadn't intended in the original
<br>
post.  My notion is that subways are so inherently
<br>
vulnerable to terrorist attack and interference-ist
<br>
attack that they are not a good investment.
<br>
<p>Let me distinguish between a terrorist and an
<br>
interference-ist.  A terrorist wants to kill people.
<br>
An interference-ist just wants to raise hell and prevent
<br>
society from progressing smoothly.
<br>
<p>A terrorist would like to get aholt of some really nasty
<br>
radioactive material and spread it thru a subway system.
<br>
Of course the really dangerous stuff is controlled and
<br>
expensive.  An interference-ist wants to create a great
<br>
deal of bother and expense without actually harming anyone.
<br>
<p>My original post spoke of someone taking some easily
<br>
available shorty half-life element such as americium,
<br>
grinding to a powder, scattering in a subway, then
<br>
alerting the local authorities that the entire system
<br>
is radioactive.  They take a geiger counter down there
<br>
and sure enough it starts to crackle.
<br>
<p>What happens then?  I speculate that the subway is
<br>
essentially shut down, useless.  It need not be anything
<br>
as dramatic as the Korean subway fire a few days ago.
<br>
Just a little harmless radiation could make the system
<br>
functionally useless.  What would it do to a major
<br>
metropolis if the subway was down for even one day?
<br>
<p>My message is similar to Amara's but also subtly different.
<br>
Roosevelt said we have nothing to fear but fear itself.
<br>
I agree, and fear itself is definitely something to
<br>
fear.  I agree with Amara that we shouldn't let fear
<br>
rule our lives.  I haven't bought any duct tape.  I didn't
<br>
even buy any rifled slugs for Mr. Twelve Gage to take
<br>
down germ-spewing crop dusters.
<br>
<p>In the Americium-in-the-subway scenario, I make the case
<br>
that the proletariat does not understand the concept of
<br>
half-life or one percent greater chance of cancer over
<br>
a lifetime.  Panic could be used to shut down the subway
<br>
system completely, even using cheap, legal and readily
<br>
available short-halflife isotopes.  Such an interference-ist
<br>
attack  would not require a single suicidal fanatic, nor
<br>
would the attack result in a single death.  The economic
<br>
and psychological impact would be difficult to estimate.
<br>
<p>It is not even perfectly clear to me that the perpetrator
<br>
would have broken any laws, even if she could be caught,
<br>
which she could not.  Its only a matter of time before the
<br>
world catches on to these sorts of vulnerabilities.
<br>
<p>Subways are so inherently vulnerable, they make no sense
<br>
to keep building them.
