Dear Sadowski Waldek,
<br>
<p>I am no enemy of the USA. I have always looked over the Atlantic and admired
<br>
this great nation and their achievements, but not necessarily their
<br>
governments and their involvements in Indochina. And Saddam is a monster
<br>
whose term of government should be over as soon as possible. Of course.
<br>
<p>If you think, that US marines will be invading the Iraq and also do it for
<br>
your children in Poland, well, believe it and be satisfied with it. But
<br>
disagreeing with this kind of a preemptive war, the US/UK want to start
<br>
pretty soon, I am expressing my doubts in and my fear of this very special
<br>
sense of mission that the conservative America displays. They send their
<br>
sons to die, do quasi religious nonsense towards their flag, great their War
<br>
Lord Bush and then pray that their realives in New York won't be
<br>
extinguished by a terrorist nuke.
<br>
<p>This dangerous kind of mammal territorial behaviour is too much for my
<br>
brain. Though being a fan of uniting the psychological opposites I do not
<br>
want to be under the spell of this kind of  nonsense that might set the
<br>
world on fire.
<br>
<p>I am no Old and no New European. I habe been in opposition to German
<br>
government all my life so far. I am sick of politicians, be they old or new,
<br>
European or American. And I do know that the stance of German chancellor
<br>
Gerhard Schroeder towards the Iraq might not emerge from the noblest of
<br>
motives. But I agree with 80 % of the German people that a war on Iraq might
<br>
set the world on fire in a way you have never thought of before.
<br>
<p>A German expert on Iraq has published a book with the title &quot;Who will be
<br>
crying for Abdul and Tanyana&quot; trying to direct the attention on the misery
<br>
of the civil deaths in Iraq. Think about dead women and children too, when
<br>
you will be proud to have conquered the oil wells with your American marine
<br>
friends
<br>
<p><p>Hubert

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes I doubt about it, as far as Iraq and Saddam are concerned. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; currently has nothing to win with a war. Every open aggression would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immediately bring up the coalition of 90/91 again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Currently&quot;, &quot;Concerned&quot;? Why? I understand that you acknowledge now the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive role of democratic Power and US Army in history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Open agression&quot;? I think Saddam is specialist in secret aggressions. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt about Second Holocaust  but I think it is very realistic scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is millions of people, tausends terrorists in Middle East that want

do
<br>
<em>&gt; it. He is dictator, that love Stalin and hate all others. He is psychic
</em><br>
ill
<br>
<em>&gt; and he has wmd. It will be very simple for him to transfer BC-weapon to

<em>&gt; Preston in last Wired:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; PRESTON: Last fall, I started thinking that the anthrax terror attack
</em><br>
might
<br>
<em>&gt; be a prelude to a smallpox attack, and that kept me awake at night.
</em><br>
Smallpox
<br>
<em>&gt; is the one organism that makes me worry for my family.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What makes it so much worse than anthrax?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smallpox knows how to make copies of itself. Unchecked, an outbreak of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smallpox will amplify globally in 20 weeks. The death rate for people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infected by natural, unmodified smallpox is one in three.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kai, Hubert awake. It is not sci-fi. It is allready our real horror. Where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are we going to..?Somebody must end it, now. Not US is yours ennemy. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't good law for such cases. Hubert, marines will do it, not for Pax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americana, for my children (3, 7,9).  Later we can/must reorganize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world. We will need extreme friendly social enviroments (democracy, much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; love, no testosteron etc.) for new &quot;magic&quot; and dangerous technologies.
</em><br>
Such
<br>
<em>&gt; organisations as Iraq, North Korea should belongs to the past, or we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (people) have no future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But now somebody must act!  You see yours ennemy in US.  I suspect you of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;antiamericanismus&quot;, now &quot;typisch deutsch&quot;. Maybe I am wrong.  I come from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;New Europe&quot; and trust in America more than Europe of Schroeder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sad?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No!
