From: <a href="mailto:humania@t-online.de?Subject=RE:%20CLIP%20(was:%20Tim%20May%20calls%20for%20nuking%20of%20D.C.">humania@t-online.de</a>

<p><em>&gt; &quot;I am aware of this with every word I write, but I have it under control,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I do it in the spirit of Carlos Castaneda's &quot;controlled
</em><br>
foolishness&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; (retranslated from German, so I don`t know if it is the original term)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh, Carlos Castaneda as in 'The Teachings of Don Juan' 'Journey to Ixtlan'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 'Tales of Power'?  Luminous Egg's?  Chewing Peyote buttons?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Yes, sure. You seem to be surprised. I had a youth that was not necessarily
<br>
dominated by natural sciences all the time. Castaneda was one of the *bad*
<br>
authors I have read - no: devoured - in a certain period of my life. &quot;
<br>
<p>Surprised, yes, but probably not in the manner you think I am.  I was quite
<br>
the fan of Castaneda in my pre subscription to Skeptical Inquirer and
<br>
Skeptic days, before my serious interest in science.  My email sig for the
<br>
longest time was 
<br>
<p>&quot;For me, there is only the traveling on paths that have heart, on any path
<br>
that may have heart. There I travel, and the only worthwhile challenge is to
<br>
traverse its full length. And there I travel looking, looking breathlessly
<br>
<p>- Don Juan Matus&quot;
<br>
<p>To this day I still find this quote inspirational and valuable, even though
<br>
most (who don't know me well) would consider me a curmudgeoned fun spoiling
<br>
devoid of spirituality skeptic.    
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh sure, I know that he has probably made up his tales, that Don Juan did
<br>
not exist at all. So what? There was a great deal of wisdom in these
<br>
stories,&quot;
<br>
<p>I agree entirely, in fact I found Castaneda's philosophical musings through
<br>
Don Juan Matus so profound in my pseudoscience embroidled youth that my
<br>
common internet handle is in fact 'Matus' and I have been using it ever
<br>
since.  You would be getting these emails from matus if not for the fact
<br>
that I subscribed from my work account.  My home page is www.matus1976.com 
<br>
<p>So it is interesting for me to see that we both followed similar paths,
<br>
starting at some point reading a lot of Castaneda, and probably other new
<br>
agey psuedoscience bunk, and then for certain reasons were drawn to better
<br>
science, and then the extropian list.  Yet despite these commonalities, we
<br>
differ so greatly on the IRAQ war question.  
<br>
<p>Anyhow, nice to see another Castaneda 'fan'
