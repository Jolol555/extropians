<p>But..... the USA traffic deaths are still worse than many countries with

mostly smaller cars and higher gas taxes.
<br>
<p>The excellent site  <a href="http://www.scienceservingsociety.com/default.htm">http://www.scienceservingsociety.com/default.htm</a>
<br>
that Edwin Evans referred us to is packed with useful data. They have an
<br>
article published in the SF Examiner 9th Dec 2002 by Leonard Evans
<br>
entitled 'We need higher taxes on gas' which eloquently sets out the
<br>
case.
<br>
Quote:
<br>
'While there is near universal agreement in the technical community that
<br>
making vehicles lighter increases fatalities, there is no corresponding
<br>
agreement that increasing the fuel economy of vehicles reduces the total
<br>
amount of fuel consumed in the nation. Making a vehicle more
<br>
fuel-economic reduces the cost of travelling each mile. This encourages
<br>
more driving, less car-pooling and less use of alternative
<br>
transportation modes. In the long run, it makes longer commuting trips
<br>
more acceptable.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no consensus on whether making vehicles more
<br>
fuel-economic increases or decreases the total amount of fuel the nation
<br>
uses, there is universal agreement among economists that increasing the
<br>
cost of a commodity reduces its consumption.'
<br>
end Quote.
<br>
<p>Leonard Evans is the same person that published the previous report that
<br>
said that big cars provide better driver protection in crashes. He
<br>
appears to have come to the conclusion that increased death rates in
<br>
spite of larger cars must mean that Americans are 'bad' drivers. Other
<br>
articles show that young males with the fastest reactions have the
<br>
highest death rate. So it is not technical skills at driving that are
<br>
the problem - it is the way they are driving that is the problem.
<br>
<p>I suspect that Newton's Laws of Motion have an affect as well. If your
<br>
SUV has a much greater mass then it will tend to keep going in the
<br>
direction of motion, especially at higher speeds. i.e. it is not as
<br>
steerable as a smaller, lighter car.
<br>
<p>The countries with the lowest traffic death rates appear to have the
<br>
strongest enforcement of traffic laws and drink-driving laws.
<br>
<p>So, there seems to be two options for the future that Americans have to
<br>
face up to:
<br>
1) Higher gas prices are the only way to reduce consumption and reduce
<br>
the power of the oilfield-owning states.
<br>
2) The freedom to drive just as you please on the roads must be
<br>
restricted in order to save lives.
