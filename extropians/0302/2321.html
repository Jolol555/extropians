Washington can pass laws and rules that apply equally well to a small

<br>
<p>Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a political principle that says the more things you regulate 
<br>
the more things you have to regulate.  In fact Hayek says that it is this 
<br>
idea that eventually leads all statists to a dictatorship.  The number of 
<br>
things being regulated become so numerous and the changes required to keep up 
<br>
so numerous that eventually a court or legislature becomes incapable of doing 
<br>
the job.  Eventually the country arrives at a point it requires a man on 
<br>
horseback to make all the decisions for everyone.  Of course the more he is 
<br>
stuck in one place making decisions the more he is out of touch so the worse 
<br>
his decisions get.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could argue that the reason that Germany &amp; the Soviet fell was 
<br>
because their leaders became progressively more and more out of touch until 
<br>
they fell of their own weight.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fall of the Soviet, questions were asked why our CIA was 
<br>
surprised by the collapse.  The answer seems to be that the Soviet citizens 
<br>
were so afraid to fail, least they be punished, they never reported the 
<br>
truth.  We had spies inside the KGB and were totally fooled because we 
<br>
thought KGB numbers would be correct -- in the end even the KGB didn't know 
<br>
what was going on.  &lt;G&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Germany no one had the guts to tell Hitler that he had suffered 
<br>
loses or lost battles because they would be shot.  In the end he was supposed 
<br>
to be ordering no longer existent units to make stands at locations the 
<br>
allies had long since captured.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford Motor Company production supervisors told me that under MacNamara 
<br>
he would tell them to do as they were told or he would replace them -- a 
<br>
really tough guy.  According to the old timers they got to count any car 
<br>
coming off the end of the production line and they dared not make their 
<br>
quota.  As a result they were rolling cars off the end of the production line 
<br>
that weren't finished.  They would then finish building the car out in the 
<br>
parking lot.
