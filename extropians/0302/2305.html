<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, it's startling the aplomb with which you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dismiss the entire strict-constructionist view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because the strict constructionist view is inherently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dishonest.  The ninth and tenth amendments are very clear,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they were put there for a very good reason: because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the framers knew the moment they started putting human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights on paper, some idiot would come along and say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;This one wasn't written down, so it must not exist&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is entirely appropriate--indeed, it is an ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mandate--for the court to enforce rights that are part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our culture but which may not have been enumerated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in 1789.  There's no written constitutional right for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me to marry a black woman, or to buy a condom, or to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school my own children; but the court has rightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognized that laws that restricted those things were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repugnant to our notions of freedom, and stripped the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; federal government, and the states, of their power to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppress the people in those ways.  An honest &quot;strict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructionist&quot; would have to favor reinstating those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws that have been soundly rejected as being against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic human freedom.
</em><br>
<p>You probably agree with me that it's best to have a 
<br>
maximally workable set of decisions made at the lowest
<br>
possible level, namely at the level of the individual.
<br>
By maximal set, you probably understand what I mean 
<br>
even if some here do not; whether property rights or
<br>
murder are to be respected or not is not included.
<br>
(Some things indeed are necessary for an entire
<br>
society, everywhere.)
<br>
<p>But failing that, and a city or a county collectively
<br>
decide to ban abortion, or to allow red-lining, or to
<br>
mandate that children must attend school---though I
<br>
would oppose each of those myself, I would defend the
<br>
right of the level to protect *its* right to decide.
<br>
<p>Now failing even that, and at the higher level yet of
<br>
the state, a decision along any of these lines is made,
<br>
then even though I strenuously disagree with the decision,
<br>
the right of the lower body should be defended against
<br>
rulings from the higher.  That is, I favor the individual
<br>
first, then the district, then the state, then the 
<br>
Federal government, and then (reluctantly) the whole
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>This is a consistent scheme, and it falls completely in
<br>
line with the wisdom encapsulated in books such as Thomas
<br>
Sowell's &quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot;.  Local decisions can
<br>
take into account local knowledge, nowhere so evident and
<br>
clear as at the level of individuals.
<br>
<p>So it is not clear to me why a large state such as 
<br>
California finds it necessary to regulate so many 
<br>
parts of our lives.  I would rather they defer these
<br>
decisions to lower levels, i.e. the counties and
<br>
communities.  Then on that level, I would likewise
<br>
point out that decisions should *not* be made even
<br>
by these bodies, but left to the individual citizens.
<br>
<p>By the same token, to force so many decisions at the 
<br>
*national* level to apply over four million square miles
<br>
of territory seems absurd.  Despite their enormous wisdom
<br>
(even unto overseeing the tiniest details of our lives
<br>
it would seem), I cannot believe that nine men and women
<br>
sitting in Washington can pass laws and rules that apply
<br>
equally well to a small tightly-knit Hasidic community
<br>
on Long Island, to the entire Appalachian South, or to
<br>
communities in southern California.  How the hell can 
<br>
they say what is appropriate in these diverse regions?
<br>
And how the devil is it that they can maintain that
<br>
*they* should be trusted in these decisions, but the
<br>
people, communities, and states at lower levels cannot
<br>
be so trusted?
<br>
