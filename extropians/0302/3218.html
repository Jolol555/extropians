<em>&gt; I would argue that, potentially, humans of average intelligence are
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singer's position seems to be that the intellectually able make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions for those who are unable to make decisions for themselves,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the latter lack the facility of decision making. If a Peter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singer SI regards average humans as unable to make decisions in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful way (seeing that, on scales relevant to SIs, such humans are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unable to make decision sets distinguishable from random noise), it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might regard average humans as unable to usefully make decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding their own welfare. If it also decides that humans suffer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of some SI discernable factor (not intelligent enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine the point of their own existence? Quite possibly), or that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the happiness cost of killing the poor human is outweighed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness benefit from creating a new SI with the human's resources,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then humans are toast.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a variant of the common fear of stratification in a post-human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future, into technological/intellectual haves and have nots, the fear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being that the haves will make decisions for the have nots (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not be pretty, think GATACCA, further down the line). Singer's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory applied to Transhumanism is a straight line to the Brave New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; World meme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not the route for Transhumanism. We are about individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice as the primary axiom. Morphological freedom is something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the disabled community would resonate with very strongly (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Unspeakable Conversations&quot;, the author's discussion of her body's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shape). Singer's utilitarian approach seems to me to lead very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly to a group-dominates-individual situation; there are just too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many requirements for groups to judge individuals and take actions up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to and including involuntary euthanasia (wow!).
</em><br>
<p>### I don't see Singer's ideas in this light. Please note that Singer does
<br>
not advocate infringing on the autonomy of infants or severely mentally
<br>
retarded. He advances the idea that they do not have the cognitive means of
<br>
forming the concept of autonomy, and willing to be alive (I think it can be
<br>
argued that we have insufficient data to settle this question today, but
<br>
this is beside the point).
<br>
<p>It is widely accepted that on the other end of the life cycle, in e.g.
<br>
adults who suffered a terminal insult to their brain, and their &quot;brain
<br>
death&quot; can be verified, withdrawal of support is an option. Once your
<br>
self-awareness, and will to live is gone, there are no obligations to
<br>
support the life of your body.
<br>
<p>If the Peter Singer SI (PSSI) realizes that humans are incapable of making
<br>
decisions crucial for survival and happiness (and are also incapable of
<br>
following good advice from the SI, like a drowning cat swimming away from
<br>
good folks who want to save it), ve would not be obliged to kill or directly
<br>
control humans - ve could simply let them be, like letting a terminal
<br>
patient die (because of his inability to actively desire and obtain
<br>
nutrition), or like letting lions and antelopes live their brutish and nasty
<br>
lives, instead of making them inhabit a bloodless paradise.
<br>
<p>The PSSI would offer help only to those who desire it and can use it without
<br>
losing their identity and autonomy. Transhumanists willing to accept massive
<br>
rewiring in search of enlightenment might some of them.
<br>
<p>This said, I really dislike and reject utilitarianism
