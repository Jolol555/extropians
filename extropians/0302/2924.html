Mirthful Damien B. opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;You're only urging this course of action, you poisonous little Australian
<br>
toad, because in your hatred of these United States you hope to see our
<br>
defenseless land crushed like a sacrificial lamb beneath of the Icelander
<br>
jackboot. And I know why you're doing it, you want to get all that sugar,
<br>
you miserable unpatriotic worm. It's a disgrace to be on the same list with
<br>
you.
<br>
Take care, Damien Broderick&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>*Iceland as Mr. Crocker had earlier noted has fired no scuds.
<br>
*Iceland has employed no Sarin gas against its purported citizenry -Kurds
<br>
*Ice apparently has not initiated aggression against its neighbors
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-caveat on this issue, but it needed to be said.
<br>
*Iceland apparently has no nuclear explosives program, but has gone 
<br>
geothermal.
<br>
*Iceland hasn't attempted to build Gerald Bull's supergun
<br>
*Iceland has not embarked on a massive smallpox propagation program.
<br>
* Iceland has not yet attempted to test technetium as a radioactive agent.
<br>
* Iceland has prepared no drones to release technetium from the air.
<br>
* Iceland apparently hasn't allied itself with Islamist groups like Al Qeida
<br>
* Iceland has not apparently used murder and mutilation of dissidents and 
<br>
their 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;family members (via Uday's Group 999) as the means of staying in power.
<br>
<p>***Though Bjork is a causus belli in my oppy!
<br>
<p>This was the short list and perhaps not even the best reason to eliminate 
<br>
Saddamo the magnificent. Note that there are several other nations bigger and 
<br>
uglier then Saddamo. These blokes will have to be dealt with, one way or 
<br>
another in the comming years. 
<br>
<p>May Yog Sothoth guide your path
