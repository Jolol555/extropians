<p>
For those of you with open minds and optimistic attitudes, here is yet
<br>
*another* research abstract about the benefits of selegiline. (I think I've
<br>
posted at least a dozen such abstracts now!)
<br>
<p>Rafal, as far as I can tell you are not interested in fairly evaluating
<br>
selegiline (deprenyl). You seem entrenched in your close-minded role as
<br>
nay-sayer. I'm quite sure there is nothing I could post here short of
<br>
absolute proof positive that would persuade you of the immense promise of
<br>
this drug for life-extension and cognitive enhancement purposes. Oh well!
<br>
I'm not posting these messages here only for your benefit.
<br>
<p>Your attitude by the way also argues against the practice of calorie
<br>
restriction in humans, despite its numerous successes in prolonging life in
<br>
lab animals.
<br>
<p>I offer this information here for others not so close-minded as you.
<br>
<p>ABSTRACT
<br>
Treatment with L-deprenyl [selegiline] prolongs life in elderly dogs

<br>
<p>Deprenyl Animal Health,
<br>
Overland Park, KS 66210  USA.
<br>
Life Sci 1997; 61(11):1037-44
<br>
<p>Eighty two beagle dogs ranging in age from 2.8 to 16.4 years and in weight
<br>
from 6.3 to 15.8 kg were allotted to 41 pairs and administered placebo or 1
<br>
mg/kg L-deprenyl orally once daily for 2 years and 10 weeks. When
<br>
survivorship for all dogs in the study was analyzed there was no significant
<br>
difference between the L-deprenyl and placebo treated groups, most likely
<br>
due to the (expected) survival of virtually all young dogs in both groups
<br>
for the duration of the study. To assess whether L-deprenyl treatment begun
<br>
in later life might enhance canine longevity in a fashion similar to that
<br>
documented in rodents we also examined survival in a subset of elderly dogs
<br>
who were between the ages of 10 and 15 yrs at the start of tablet
<br>
administration and who received tablets for at least 6 months. In this
<br>
subset, dogs in the L-deprenyl group survived longer (p &lt; 0.05) than dogs in
<br>
the placebo group. Twelve of 15 (80%) dogs in the L-deprenyl group survived
<br>
to the conclusion of the study, in contrast to only 7 of 18 (39%) of the
<br>
dogs who received placebo (P=0.017).  Furthermore, by the time the first
<br>
L-deprenyl treated dog died on day 427, 5 placebo treated dogs had already
<br>
succumbed, the first on day 295.  Specifically with respect to dogs, the
<br>
findings reported herein suggest daily oral administration of 1 mg/kg
<br>
L-deprenyl prolongs life when begun in relatively healthy dogs 10-15 years
<br>
of age and maintained for the duration of the individual's life, but in any
<br>
event for no less than six months
