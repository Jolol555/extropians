<em>&gt; All of your references pertain to the US support of Contras against the

</em><br>
<p>As far as I, as a foreigner, understand Brett's question, he asked for at 
<br>
least _one_ incident, where the US government broke a treaty. He didn't 
<br>
ask why or if this breach was justified. He only asked for a case.
<br>
<p>Subsection 7 of the final decision [1] shows a &quot;*clear* and *unambiguous* 
<br>
instance of a treaty breach by the US [...] of the sort an impartial and 
<br>
reasonable third party would recognize&quot;:
<br>
<p>&quot;[...] by the acts referred to in subparagraph (6) ['laying mines in the 
<br>
internal or territorial waters of the Republic of Nicaragua during the 
<br>
first months of 1984'] hereof the United States of America has acted, 
<br>
against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligations under 
<br>
Article XIX of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between 
<br>
the United States of America and the Republic of Nicaragua signed at 
<br>
Managua on 21 January 1956;&quot;
<br>
<p>Even if you'd dispute that the US has ever signed the UN charta or say 
<br>
that the UN was a club of communists at that time [everyone left of 
<br>
Cheney is a communist in your eyes, right? What a simple world; must be 
<br>
very comfy], this seems to be a proven breach of the treaty between 
<br>
Nicaragua and the US, the US have ignored the decision and the US have 
<br>
ignored the UN resolutions. These are the facts, whatever excuses you may 
<br>
produce. It is a totally different question, if these actions were 
<br>
justified by any &quot;higher moral standard&quot;.
