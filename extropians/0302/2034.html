Hello again,
<br>
<p>&quot;escape pods&quot;
<br>
<p>The STS system as it currently exists has a 1 in 200 chance of a 
<br>
&quot;show-stopper&quot; event occurring. Not what that fellow said on NPR this 
<br>
weekend - not 1 in 200 of catastrophic failure, it's simply that 
<br>
whatever was going to happen is not going to. We saw this a few times 
<br>
on our way to launch this January: 1 in 200, Columbia sits on the 
<br>
pad, again, again. Unfortunately, this time it appears that our 1 in 
<br>
200 for this mission was the functioning of the two port elevons. 
<br>
What stopped them from working is unknown.
<br>
<p>What does this have to do with escape pods? You add something with 
<br>
explosive bolts that is supposed to shoot part of the shuttle 
<br>
outwards, and that number becomes 1 in 195? add seven of them 1 in 
<br>
150? Oh, and half the people sit upstairs, and half downstairs during 
<br>
atmospheric operations? 1 in 100?
<br>
<p>&quot;black boxes&quot;
<br>
<p>The shuttle has a &quot;cockpit voice recorder&quot; on board. It's just not a 
<br>
&quot;black box&quot; - it wasn't meant to survive serious maltreatment. I will 
<br>
add at this point that the two story crew cabin is meant to withstand 
<br>
horrific (to a human) force along the line of 20gs, from more than 
<br>
one axis I believe.  So the whole contraption is sort of a black box. 
<br>
Though I doubt it survived the cooked off RCS, fuel cell and OMS 
<br>
systems.

<p><p><em>&gt;It's not just the shuttle. I've often wondered why planes don't have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;video input into black boxes when every gas station has one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I bet the only reason they don't have an emergency escape/landing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pod is cost and weight. They should have one for obirtal problems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that are immediate (too quick for rescue). It's the mighty $ or lack 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of it. The TV news claimed today that NASA's budget was down 40% 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the mid 90s. Meanwhile the US B2 fleet is five times the size 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and each B2 costs the same as a shuttle.

<em>&gt;&gt;Well, hmm, that sounds implausible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Is this just an attempt to prevent looting/souveniring of the flight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;recorder etc?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I was watching yesterday and a reporter asked about if the shuttle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had a &quot;black box&quot; flight recorder and the official said that it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;didn't have one. How many millions of dollars the thing was worth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and they don't have BLACK BOXES??? That seems very strange to me, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and I know that they have a continuous stream of data coming down 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through telemetry, but STILL?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also, doesn't the shuttle have some sort of emergency eject system? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course, if they were at too high an altitude, or the explosion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was too sudden for a crew reaction, this wouldn't be useable in any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;event, but I would think that the designers would have tried to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;account for such occurrances. Maybe making the entire crew cabin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explosion-proof, sealed off from the rest of the craft during 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liftoff and reentry, and maybe a redundant chute/airbag kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system? Does anyone have info on this?
