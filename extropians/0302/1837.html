Subject: Re: Complaint about American Media (was IRAQ: Euro Multipolarity
<br>
Shows Up)
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;What do I think we should do?
<br>
Well, I certainly don't like a military invasion.  How about a $100,000
<br>
bounty for the head and right hand of anyone who can be proved to be
<br>
either a tax collector or an administrator (or manager) of the Iraqi
<br>
government?  That should stop them pretty quickly.  (Perhaps pay an
<br>
equal defection bonus?  Is that enough that they could find some other
<br>
country to accept them?)
<br>
<p>Perhaps I'm being too chintzy.  Given the prices of weapons these days
<br>
(and the difficulty of establishing proof) it might be cost effective to
<br>
double it to $200,000.&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I'm not in favor of invasion either.
<br>
I always find it interesting to invert the direction of an action and see
<br>
what I think of it then (helps with the tribalist gibbering savage that's
<br>
pulling strings in my head).
<br>
<p>Imagine....
<br>
Osama Bin Laden (or one of his surviving assistants) announces that
<br>
in a change of tactics he will stop bombing innocent civilians and instead
<br>
will be putting a US$ 1 Million bounty on anyone who takes out a member
<br>
of the Great Satan at the (oh let's say) O-7 military OR a civilian Federal
<br>
employee at the Assistant Deputy Secretary level or higher.
<br>
<p>I think I would have to say this would be an act of war. I suspect
<br>
it would be far more provacative as an action that killing a few thousand
<br>
innocents in a &quot;traditional terrorist&quot; action.
<br>
<p>I suspect we would look seriously at nuking anyone who tried this.
<br>
Why should our enemies not take the same attitude about bounties
<br>
if the US offered them for Hussien and his crew?
<br>
<p>Just a thought,
<br>
Brian
