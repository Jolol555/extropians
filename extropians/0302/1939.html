D.B. stated:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Here's a rousing piece by Oriana Fallaci, immediately post 9/11, that will
<br>
put blood in the eye of many an extrope poster:
<br>
<a href="http://www.courses.rochester.edu/halle/Major%20Seminar/fallaci.html">http://www.courses.rochester.edu/halle/Major%20Seminar/fallaci.html</a>
<br>
Despite the, ahem, touch of hysteria, it's not hard to sympathize with her
<br>
position and her passion.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I had read the Falacci excoriation's of the Islamists, several months ago, 
<br>
and my first reaction was: &quot;We appreciate your current support, as much as we 
<br>
appreciated your vituperative criticisms of  us in past years..&quot;  But I 
<br>
cannot fault Ms Falacci for her politicial points. One either considers 
<br>
Islamic Fundamentalism a threat, or one does not, one either see's the 
<br>
Islamists taking violent action against &quot;Western&quot; peoples; or one doesn't. 
<br>
<p>If you don't see the Islamists as doing this, then of course, you can then 
<br>
view Americans as war mongering empire builders; and are now in the process 
<br>
of pulling a wag-the-dog propaganda campaign, and leading agression against 
<br>
innocents.  If you happen to see the Islamists as a real threat; then the 
<br>
vision is quite the reverse, and American behavior is understandable, if not 
<br>
entirely coherent.
<br>
<p>The truth is not maleable. Either Falacci is correct, or the opponents of 
<br>
American intervention are correct.
