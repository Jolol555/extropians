<p><em>&gt; (Lee Corbin &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=RE:%20Hazards%20of%20Coal%20Burning%20was%20RE:%20Hydrogen%20as%20SCAM?">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've always thought that figures such as these---three million---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do need to be adjusted for &quot;expected number of years of life lost&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That is, although it's still a tragedy, the loss of an eighty-five
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; year old ought not to be regarded with the sense of loss as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fifteen year old.  Their deaths (on the first reading) cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be equated because the eighty-five year old is nearly certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to die anyway shortly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can I nominate this for the most un-extropian statement of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; month?  Perhaps the year?
</em><br>
<p>You ought to have quoted my follow up paragraph:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; (That being said, of course, it's still always important for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropians and cryonicists to emphasize that so far as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know, all deaths today are needless.  The technology currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exists to banish death (again, so far as we know).  Hence, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this point of view, one can consider the death of an 85 year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; old to be an even *greater* tragedy.)
</em><br>
<p>and perhaps I ought to have made that even stronger!  But
<br>
as it is, damn few people on this list have spoken out
<br>
more strongly in favor of cryonics and against death
<br>
than have I.  I should publish my &quot;Deathoid Holocaust&quot;
<br>
piece here again soon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Death--all deaths, for any reason--are bad.  But if I am forced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to compare the loss of an 85-year-old to a 15-year-old, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the former more tragic because more has been lost: more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge, experience, wisdom; more friends and family and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working relationships.  The fact that the 85-year-old is likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to die soon is not a premise to be reasoned from, it is the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; battle we are trying to fight.
</em><br>
<p>To fend off death for our elderly is indeed the major
<br>
long-term battle.  But when you have to triage, you
<br>
have to triage.  If a doctor had to choose (yes, I
<br>
know that thank goodness it's never so simple) between
<br>
the life *TODAY* of an 85 year old and a 15 year old,
<br>
there is only one moral answer.  Let us suppose that
<br>
this particular 85 year old has a life expectancy
<br>
of three years, and that the 15 year old has a life
<br>
expectancy of sixty years.  It's clear *to me* at 
<br>
least, what the correct decision would be.
<br>
