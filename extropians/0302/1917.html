I wasn't going to plug this - it smacks too much of exploitation of
<br>
tragedy for my tastes - but it needs to be said.  This kind of senseless
<br>
waste of a space program has to be corrected, and there is a way we can
<br>
do it.  That way is not to spend all the energy we have dreaming up
<br>
alternatives, such that we then have no energy to actually build the
<br>
things.  We have to actually build and fly the alternatives...and this
<br>
is not as impossible as it seems.

<p>And the test data some of us have been gathering proves that out.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.erps.org/">http://www.erps.org/</a>
<br>
<p>If you'd like to help stop something like this from happening again,
<br>
talk to us (or any of the other groups doing what we're doing, like
<br>
XCOR) and see if there is a way that you can help.  Money is typically
<br>
in shorter supply than engineering talent.  (For instance, if you know a
<br>
company that could use XCOR's services, or that might be willing to make
<br>
a donation to ERPS, convincing them to inquire to the appropriate
<br>
organization might help more than personally trying to redesign the
<br>
rockets.  Not that ERPS will object to people studying and improving
<br>
their designs, either - so long as you work with what they have, and not
<br>
suggest to completely scrap their development in favor of some other
<br>
scheme.)
<br>
<p>How would we help?  Once space access is cheap, the common sense answer
<br>
would not be to try to land a broken bird with people on board, but to
<br>
send up another bird to get everyone off first, or even to repair the
<br>
bird in orbit.  The financial cost of the shuttle program has,
<br>
yesterday, caused a more human cost, and it will continue to do so so
<br>
long as the present methods of space access remain the only viable ones
<br>
- and the powers that be have shown that they will not, despite the
<br>
rhetoric, seriously develop alternatives on their own.
<br>
<p>Even this disaster will not convince them otherwise; if you don't
<br>
believe that, just look at NASA's history on this issue.  They'll study.
<br>
They'll agonize.  They'll hem and haw.  And then what's left of the
<br>
shuttle fleet will be pressed back into service, with perhaps some
<br>
grumblings about replacements but no actual replacements.  It would
<br>
take the (possibly actual, possibly just effective) elimination of the
<br>
entire shuttle fleet, making manned space access impossible for NASA
<br>
except by going through foreign agencies, before NASA will budge on this
<br>
issue without external pressure - and then mostly because they will have
<br>
to put the budget that used to be for the shuttle to some use.
<br>
<p>I sincerely wish I was wrong about that.  But I see no evidence to the
<br>
contrary.  Which means it is up to us to act - but those who would act,
<br>
must act effectively if their actions are to mean anything.
