From: Lee Corbin [mailto:<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=RE:%20Bush%20budget%20has%200%20dollars%20for%20Afghanistan">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; Are you sure that any exterior *power* really has the ability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do such farsighted surgery on a nation, and change its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture in the process?  It would be instructive to consider 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases in world history where this has been done.  Do you know of
</em><br>
any?
<br>
<p>Sure.  The US in Japan.  China in its own rural areas.  Rome in its
<br>
provinces.  Heck, Britain in large swaths of the world!  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; mez:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We destroyed a country and toppled its government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't that an exaggeration? 
</em><br>
<p>You're right, it is.  20 years of warfare had already destroyed the
<br>
country's infrastructure.  We did a bit more damage, but mostly the
<br>
country was already destroyed by the time we got there.  My apologies
<br>
for exaggerating.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1. The legal rights of individuals must be sacrosanct,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    and all individuals must be equal before the law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Government corruption must be minimal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. Private property must be totally respected under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. Private property must be an integral part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    legal system, and publicly registered.  This includes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    all businesses and real estate.  (This is DeSoto's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    conclusion after 20 years' study.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5. A high level of trust for others outside one's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    family must be achievable, otherwise it is not possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    to create firms of any size.
</em><br>
<p>This is a great list.  I would certainly add to this list - education
<br>
and infrastructure both accelerate growth.  I'd also note that every
<br>
item on the list you have above boils down to the rule of law.  To
<br>
establish that rule of law in Iraq is going to take time and patience
<br>
on the part of the US.  If we install a new government and leave, the
<br>
odds are against the establishment of the rule of law any time soon.
<br>
If we stick around for years and maybe even multiple decades, we can
<br>
help establish it.
<br>
<p>My question again is:  Does the US have the commitment to stick around
<br>
in Iraq long enough to establish a stable and prosperous democracy?
<br>
This is (mostly) not about money - its about US presence in the area.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For it can well-inhere in the cultural foundations of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society or civilization.  While Turkey, or perhaps soon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iran or Iraq, may aspire to Western level prosperity, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be deep-seated relationships between the culture that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animates the lives of their millions of citizens, their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions, and their histories that simply cannot be changed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except over the course of many, many decades, if at all.
</em><br>
<p>Lee, I think this argument boils down to &quot;Muslims aren't cut out for
<br>
democracy&quot;.  I think the evidence is otherwise.  Turkey is a fully
<br>
functioning democracy with 63 million citizens.  Indonesia, the most
<br>
populous muslim state, is a democracy, if a young and fragile one.
<br>
Lebanon is a democracy.    Voter turnout for Iran's last election was
<br>
83%.  83%!!! When was the last time the US had that kind of voter
<br>
turnout?  Pro-democracy forces in Iran were steadily making headway in
<br>
the country until Bush energized their fundamentalist foes with the
<br>
&quot;axis of evil&quot; and a first-strike policy.
<br>
<p>A desire for self-rule is a basic part of humans.  Most arabs hate
<br>
their corrupt, dictatorial governments, and for good reason.  What
<br>
they need is help from a strong democratic power like the US to help
<br>
install and shepherd democracy in their countries.
