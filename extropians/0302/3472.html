</em><br>
<p>In an effort to juxtapose the erudite comments by Amara and Sterling,
<br>
I offer (from [1]):
<br>
<p>&quot;Grown men go goofy with bead lust and outleap grandmothers and small
<br>
children. Stockbrokers scale wobbling ladders with beers and butterfly
<br>
nets and flail at the plastic downpour. The inattentive, or most drunk,
<br>
get socked in the head with imitation pearls.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;'What's more exciting than shiny round objects when you're trashed?'
<br>
said Greg Smith, a college student who has divined one of the many
<br>
secrets of the bead.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The most prestigious throw at Carnival is not a bead at all, but a
<br>
coconut, a real coconut, brightly painted and decorated, handed down
<br>
from the floats by riders in the predominantly black krewe Zulu.
<br>
The coconuts used to be thrown, like beads, but people were prone
<br>
to miss. The outcome was, at times, unfortunate.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'll note as an aside that I believe there are a couple of
<br>
festivals, one I think in Spain involving tomatoes and of
<br>
course there is the infamous Palio in Siena.
<br>
<p>So such levity is not only a U.S. phenomena...
<br>
<p>I wonder what an AI would thinks of such foolishness?
