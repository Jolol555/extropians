<p><em>&gt; Here in UK, ITV news has just shown remarkable pictures from NASA, taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the mission, showing extensive damage to the left wing of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shuttle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/">http://www.itv.com/news/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The TV pictures seemed to be clearer than the web site picture above. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reckon a large part of the left wing just tore off during the stress of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-entry. They didn't have a hope of getting back.
</em><br>
<p>I've been following some discussion of this picture on the
<br>
sci.space.shuttle newsgroup.  The picture was not released by NASA,
<br>
rather it was an Israeli report based on video footage taken a few days
<br>
ago when the Israeli astronaut, Ilan Ramon, was talking by phone to
<br>
the prime minister.  Ramon aimed the camera out the window to show the
<br>
viewing audience the Earth, and later people went back to the footage and
<br>
saw what appeared to be ominous-looking cracks.  You can read an English
<br>
version of the Israeli report at <a href="http://www.maarivenglish.com/index.htm">http://www.maarivenglish.com/index.htm</a>.
<br>
<p>Actually these aren't cracks at all, and that is not the wing of the
<br>
shuttle.  It is part of the aft cargo bay bulkhead, as you can see from
<br>
this picture, <a href="http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/STS1/10060370.jpg">http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/STS1/10060370.jpg</a>,
<br>
which is about 90 degrees off from the one from Maariv.  (This picture
<br>
is not from this last flight of Columbia.) On this flight the shuttle
<br>
cargo bay was filled with Spacelab, and the Israeli picture is probably
<br>
taken from within the lab, from much closer to the bulkhead and looking
<br>
out across the bulkhead at an angle.  The &quot;cracks&quot; are separations among
<br>
the insulating blankets.
<br>
<p>Another interesting thing about the aft-bulkhead picture is that it shows
<br>
obvious missing tiles, although these are on the top rather than the
<br>
bottom.  I believe there have been several shuttle landings where tiles
<br>
were found missing and damaged.  However we don't hear about that now,
<br>
because it would complicate the story the media is trying to tell, which
<br>
is that any damage to a tile could explain the shuttle's destruction.
<br>
In fact it's not that simple; the shuttle has survived re-entry with
<br>
bad tiles.  Maybe this time the damage was worse, or maybe the law of
<br>
averages finally caught up with them.
