<p><em>&gt; I don't reckon personality could have the same meaning when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a neo-nate is the referent as opposes to say a five year old 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child because of the still-developing brain. Piaget outlines 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stages of development/learning that most children go through.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The actual stages still seem to hold true even though the rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at which a particular child goes through them can vary.
</em><br>
<p>It's important to know that in important ways, Piaget has
<br>
been debunked.  One of his famous experiments was to observe
<br>
that young children were incapable of &quot;conservation&quot; in the
<br>
following:  present a row of jelly beans to a young child,
<br>
and have him note the quantity of beans.  Then separate
<br>
the beans by a somewhat larger distance, so as to make the
<br>
row longer.  When you ask the child, say four years old or
<br>
so, whether there are more or not, the child will reply 
<br>
that there is more.
<br>
<p>I used to wonder (just a little) about this, thinking that
<br>
perhaps the communication wasn't reliable, and that perhaps
<br>
the child didn't know what you meant by &quot;more&quot;.  But I 
<br>
assumed that Piaget had taken this into account---after all,
<br>
I did a term paper on him, and knew that he had spent years
<br>
on this stuff.
<br>
<p>However, later research shows that indeed there was a problem,
<br>
as exposed when the experiment is done this way:  the adult
<br>
sets up a row of jelly beans, and gets the child to notice
<br>
their extent.  Then the adult experimenter pretends to be
<br>
distracted and turns away for a moment while a colleague
<br>
manipulates a puppet bear who arranges the beans in a longer
<br>
format.
<br>
<p>The experimenter turns around and says, &quot;oh the silly bear
<br>
has been here.  Is the amount of beans the same or not?&quot;
<br>
This time, the children (even at very early ages) answer
<br>
correctly.
<br>
<p>So it's interesting to speculate on what is going on in the
<br>
mind of the child, especially in Piaget's experiments.  The
<br>
child sees this all-knowing and very powerful adult rearrange
<br>
the beans, and the child can see that the adult has all the
<br>
information.  So when the adult asks the seemingly stupid
<br>
question &quot;are there more?&quot;, the child figures that the adult
<br>
must be getting at something else, perhaps the length of the
<br>
configuration.
