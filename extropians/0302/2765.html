<em>&gt; The protests are anti-American is goal and nature. What they want is

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>As far as I know, the anti-war protests I have been involved with are 
<br>
basically anti-DEATH and speaking out  against bullying tactics by my own #$%&amp;
<br>
@! government! Anti-American??? I THINK NOT!   Anti-current warmongering 
<br>
policy, YES.
<br>
<p>What *I* want as a protester is a government that does not DICTATE to its 
<br>
citizens and the world that it means to be &quot;the boss&quot;, and that it is always 
<br>
RIGHT! Our government needs to continuously work harder with the other 
<br>
countries of the world and come together to deal more effectively with people 
<br>
like Osama who perpetuate fear and death among us human beings. We need to 
<br>
learn to deal effectively with problems like these on a global scale, not 
<br>
unilaterally as &quot;King George II&quot; wants to do.
<br>
<p>The world will always be full of &quot;thugs&quot;, I just don't think that the United 
<br>
States should become one of them by threatening other countries with it's own 
<br>
WMD's FOR ANY REASON! Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a JUSTIFIED war with 
<br>
conventional high-tech weapons, for reasons such as if a country tries to 
<br>
forcibly take over its neighgbor or perpetuates &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; or 
<br>
whatever you want to call it. I certainly don't think that a war can be 
<br>
justified just because a country is choosing to pursue building weapons of 
<br>
ANY sort. That alone does not constitute a direct threat to the United States 
<br>
or any other country. IF the government in charge actually DOES make specific 
<br>
threats and actually uses them, THEN go right ahead and bomb the crap out of 
<br>
them!
<br>
<p>As for the &quot;rogue entities&quot; (meaning terrorist groups etc.), if they REALLY 
<br>
want weapons, there will always be people out there willing to sell to them, 
<br>
that is unavoidable no matter how many countries are involved in the &quot;War 
<br>
against Terrorism&quot;. I can't think of any real effective way of controlling 
<br>
the uncontrollable, but I do think that increasing national security is a 
<br>
good thing as long as our civil liberties are still protected (which I 
<br>
definitely think they are not!).
<br>
<p>Can we please stop this madness from spreading?
