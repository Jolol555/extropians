<p>Actually that is not what we've been doing.

<p><em>&gt; I would much rather see comments on the exact

</em><br>
<p>I have posted about 8 or 12 research abstracts about the subject, most
<br>
of which describe possible mechanisms of action in some detail. I
<br>
suggest you go back and read them. 
<br>
<p>At one point in this discussion I suggested to Rafal that we should be
<br>
debating how selegiline is neuroprotective, not whether it is
<br>
neuroprotective, but he has continued to stonewall on the subject of
<br>
whether it works for this purpose at all. This despite my having posted
<br>
numerous animal studies and one human study showing evidence of
<br>
neuroprotection and life-extension by selegiline.
<br>
<p>Rafal hangs his hat on a single study in which selegiline (deprenyl)
<br>
slowed the progression of Parkinson's disease symptoms (a remarkable
<br>
result!) but in which the drug was not found to actually extend the life
<br>
of those same Parkinson's patients. Meanwhile, a large number of studies
<br>
in animals (and one admittedly less well controlled study in humans)
<br>
give us strong evidence that it does in fact protect neurons and extend
<br>
life. Other studies show that it enhances cognitive ability -- in fact
<br>
selegiline is approved for this purpose for veterinary purposes under
<br>
the trade name Anipryl. If your old dog is acting senile, you can tell
<br>
your vet about it and get a prescription for Anipryl (selegiline). No
<br>
doubt it would be approved for human cognitive enhancement as well if
<br>
only our conservative medical establishment were more willing to
<br>
consider as valid the pursuit of life enhancement by pharmaceutical
<br>
means in people not formally diagnosed with disease. The pharmaceutical
<br>
industry and the researchers they sponsor are interested in finding
<br>
cures and treatments for sick people -- they are not very interested in
<br>
bettering the health of well people, and so almost no research dollars
<br>
flow toward that end.
<br>
<p>As I've mentioned here in the past, the most likely mechanism by which
<br>
selegiline (deprenyl) extends lifespan is via neuroprotection by
<br>
upregulation of SOD and catalase in the central nervous system. These
<br>
are two natural antioxidants that have been shown to be associated with
<br>
increased life-expectancy in other anti-aging experiments totally
<br>
unrelated to selegiline.
<br>
<p>The theoretical pieces of the puzzle all fit together to me, but then
<br>
enhancement of human life by nutritional and pharmaceutical means is my
<br>
business. I am a consultant in this field.
