<em>&gt; &gt; Every left wing nutjob that gets wasted helping the Iraqis commit

<em>&gt; war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crimes will be doing their part to reducing the erosion of the

<em>&gt; &gt; integrity of the republic by removing their corrosive presence from

<em>&gt; our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; body politic... I promise to nominate anyone who goes to Iraq for

<em>&gt; this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; purpose for posthumous Darwin Awards. You are certainly worth the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure the human shield idea is ridiculous and there ARE a bunch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lunatics in the peace movement.But you can't do away with lots of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of *normal* people demonstrating against the war last 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weekend. People like Tim May and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human shield supporters are an extremely insignificant voice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within this group.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, they are the leaders and extremist proponents that
<br>
drive the whole movement to further offense. For example, where would
<br>
the luddite movement be today if the members of the Merry Pranksters
<br>
and other similar groups had put their asses where their mouths were by
<br>
doing something equally risky back during 'Nam? It would not exist as a
<br>
movement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You falcons do not seem to realize that the US will be an aggressor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no matter how terrible Sadam is. It is against international law to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invade a country under the given circumstances. 
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, Saddam has sent assasination teams into the US to kill
<br>
former President Bush, and Iraq remains in violation of the original
<br>
cease fire agreement. Absolutely NOTHING we plan to do in Iraq is in
<br>
violation of international law. We have both the original UN mandates
<br>
of the first Gulf War as well as our national rights of self defense
<br>
under the UN Charter to justify our actions.
<br>
<p>And, no, the US will not be an agressor no matter how terrible Saddam
<br>
is. What we are is out of patience for people like him and bin Laden,
<br>
and once we've wiped the world clean of their type, we will quite
<br>
happily retire to our farms much like Cincinnatus.
<br>
<p>THose of you who fail to see the justice of our cause are quite plainly insane.
