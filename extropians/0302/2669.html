<em>&gt; &gt; We can also put it in different terms. MWI supposes there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communication between different worlds. Hence, imo, it supposes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is no 'interference' between different components of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wave function (at least after the splitting occurs). But having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no 'interference' means a transition from an original 'pure' state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to a 'mixture'. And we know, from a Von Neumann theorem, that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the change from a 'pure' state to a 'mixture' the entropy increases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (On the contrary the evolution described by the Schroedinger equation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is unitary and the entropy is invariant).
</em><br>
<p>[Hal]
<br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps we mean different things by MWI?  In my view the MWI is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the position that Schroedinger evolution is the only thing that happens,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no state function reduction.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, maybe there are many different MWI.
<br>
<p>I.e. there is one MWI assuming that quantum objects, detectors,
<br>
observers, etc., are simply *split* between the various branches.
<br>
This also means that there is only one particle shot through a
<br>
Young two-slit interferometer. And, extending to the macroscopic
<br>
domain, there is only one detector, and only one observer,
<br>
somehow *split* between different worlds. It is really difficult,
<br>
for me, to understand what does it mean when we say that an observer
<br>
(macroscopic) is *split*. (Yes I know there are macroscopic effects
<br>
with clockwise and - at same time - anticlockwise currents of electrons,
<br>
and this is a superposition indeed, but in the same world).
<br>
<p>There is another MWI assuming that particles, observers, and instruments,
<br>
are *multiplied*. That is, this MWI states that each of the branches
<br>
contains a particle, an observer (whose consciousness is in a well
<br>
defined state), a detector (whose pointer is in a well defined state).
<br>
I can understand this one. But this MWI implies the entropy increase,
<br>
and irreversibility. This was pointed out by Peres and, as far as
<br>
I remember, was shown by Vaidman, in a gedanken experiment.
<br>
<p>[There is also a mixture of the two above MWI theories!]
<br>
<p>'On Schizophrenic Experiences of the Neutron or Why We Should 
<br>
Believe in the Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Theory'
<br>
- Lev Vaidman
<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9609006">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9609006</a>
<br>
This is a philosophical paper in favor of the Many-Worlds Interpretation
<br>
(MWI) of quantum theory. The concept of the ``measure of existence of a
<br>
world'' is introduced and some difficulties with the issue of probability 
<br>
in the framework of the MWI are resolved. Brief comparative analyses of 
<br>
the Bohm theory and the Many-Minds Interpretation are given.
<br>
<p>&quot;However, the two branches [...] correspond to different worlds,
<br>
between which there can be no communication, once an irreversible
<br>
process has occurred. This approach has several variations which
<br>
are called the 'relative state interpretation' and the 'many worlds
<br>
interpretation'. None is satisfactory because they merely replace
<br>
the arbitrariness of the collapse postulate by that of the
<br>
no-communication hypothesis.&quot;
<br>
- Asher Peres, 'Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods',
<br>
Kluwer Ac. Press, 1998, p. 374.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Tegmark argues that universes join as well as branch.  We may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple pasts as well as multiple futures.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this seems similar to Feynman paths. But Tegmark here introduces
<br>
decoherence. And, again, I cannot understand how to explain decoherence 
<br>
and reversibility at the same time.
<br>
<p>Decoherence means that correlations between the quantum system and
<br>
the instrument (and/or observer) cannot be destroyed, but they are 
<br>
downloaded into the environment. This also means that, in general, the 
<br>
entropy of the quantum system, plus the entropy of the apparatus, plus the 
<br>
entropy of the environment, remains [surprise] *constant*. But it also 
<br>
means that, due to the extension of the environment, it is impossible to 
<br>
reconstruct the *initial state*, because one should reconstruct the state 
<br>
of the entire universe!
