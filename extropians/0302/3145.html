</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;have made 3 conclusions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;1) It will be very difficult to take anything Tim May says 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;seriously in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;future, and that makes me a little sad because at one time he had some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;pretty good ideas. The man has gone nuts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of the things he had to say in that piece were interesting, but by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end (particularly the Nuke DC bit), well, yes, it seems clear that he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insane.
</em><br>
<p>I hear overheated rhetoric, and read it, all the time. Overwrought,
<br>
hyperbolic, impolitic. It's far from clear to me that he's insane.
<br>
But it's quite clear he's going to be taken for crazy by those who
<br>
say they will, and some other hard-to-determine fraction of the
<br>
people who encounter that utterance, especially at nth hand.
<br>
<p>Let's go meta for a minute, and consider three other test cases.
<br>
<p>1) &quot;A&quot; says that the recent loss of the shuttle is a good thing, and that
<br>
&quot;The PRC needs to eat the West's lunch in space. When they set up a permanent
<br>
penal/army colony on the Moon, the US and the ESA will perhaps wake up.
<br>
It's more important that the human race get off the rock than that the
<br>
flags waved be American.&quot;
<br>
<p>2) &quot;B&quot; discusses the notion of acceptable casualties in a protracted nuclear
<br>
exchange for many pages in a popular press book.
<br>
<p>3) &quot;C&quot; says that public figure &quot;C-prime&quot; should be &quot;shot wth a .44 Bulldog&quot;
<br>
because C-prime is the titular head of a lawful organization which C disapproves of.
<br>
C has often indulged in classical revolutionary-violent rhetoric such as the phrase
<br>
&quot;by any means necessary&quot;.
<br>
<p>Whic, if any, of A, B, and C are clearly crazy? Why, or why not?
