One would have thought that checking the extent of damage should happen on
<br>
every occasion of tile damage, even if it is frequent. Someone got
<br>
complacent. I can't believe they can't have a decent camera remote on jets.
<br>
It reminds me of planes not having video of passengers in the cockpit before
<br>
September eleven  -when every gas station and bar has them for nearly 20
<br>
years.

<em>&gt; [...] If we had built - they didn't need developing because NASA Ames had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already developed them, although NASA Houston killed the program - real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space suits, we would also have provided means for using them, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some shuttle tile material and some super glue, tether lines, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instructions in repair procedures; but because we have never had decent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suits, NASA preferred not to know about damage on takeoff. Me, I'd like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know: at least there's a chance to say goodbye. And there's always a
</em><br>
chance
<br>
<em>&gt; that human ingenuity will come up with a miracle, as was done with Apollo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 13. Not a high chance, but some of us would prefer to go out trying. Given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the size of the chunk that hit Columbia on takeoff there's a high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability that inspection would have shown there was no chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surviving re-entry. That would leave rescue by Atlantis, a race against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time. Or a decision to go in, knowing there wasn't much chance. Or a
</em><br>
search
<br>
<em>&gt; for something else. But at least they'd know. [etc]
