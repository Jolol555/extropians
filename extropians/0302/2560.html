<br>
<p>Charles,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from a family that is frequently involved in politics.  Your 
<br>
letter and others set off warning bells in my mind.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to wonder how much this example you submitted is subsidized out 
<br>
of the public trough and who the beneficiaries are?  Your or someone 
<br>
mentioned that GM was able to get a public transit system that worked removed 
<br>
and that now you have a system that doesn't work.  Unless they used political 
<br>
pressure how did they manage to get that done?  Did they pay someone off?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you example of how politics can pay off where folks 
<br>
wouldn't expect it to.  In my native Missouri we passed a law that each 
<br>
driver getting a new driver's license has to pass a written test as well as a 
<br>
performance test to get the license.  Of course that law was sold as 
<br>
beneficial to driving safety.  But was that the motive for the Pols that got 
<br>
out and sold the new law.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain my doubt.  My uncle was a State Representative and 
<br>
Chairman of the State Ways and Means Committee.  That may have a different 
<br>
name but I relate it to the US Congress names.  My uncle got ambitious and 
<br>
ran for State Treasurer -- the party had told him not to and consequently he 
<br>
had to run against the party.  He lost and after the party considered him 
<br>
sufficiently punished he was brought back as manager of one of the State 
<br>
Driver's License Examing Station.  The party parked him in that position 
<br>
until they had an office they wanted him to fill.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very common.  As an elected official he was given certain 
<br>
civil service jobs that were his to fill -- naturally his campaign workers 
<br>
got those positions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles, I could go on.  There is a famous civil rights leader here in 
<br>
the Chicago area.  He had worked down South with a civil rights organization. 
<br>
&nbsp;When he came to Chicago he was supposedly sent to whoever handled jobs for 
<br>
the old Mayor Daly.  The leader was offered a job as ticket taker or 
<br>
something equally lowly on the Tri State Tollway.  The leader was insulted 
<br>
because he considered the job beneath him.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that when we look at something like a publically owned 
<br>
mass transit system you and I probably don't know what the real criteria or 
<br>
intention is in operating that system.  We don't know what graft is involved 
<br>
and we don't know what the real payoff is.
<br>
Ron h.
