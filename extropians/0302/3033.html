<p>
Brain dump on my experiences with speed reading and software for same.
<br>
<p>I own the middle priced version of AceReader (AceReader Pro). As others have mentioned
<br>
it's rather firehose-like. One of the chief things missing from it is a customizable
<br>
delay at the end of a paragraph. I think that reduces comprenension for me; topic
<br>
changes tend to happen at the start of paragraphs, and in dialog, the speaker shifts,
<br>
of course; for both these reasons I like having a moment to &quot;set&quot; memory before
<br>
plunging in. AceReader lets you set 'tween-sentence delay, but doesn't treat paragraphs
<br>
specially. That's a bug, IMO.
<br>
<p>I've mentioned that to the producer of the product but I don't think it's anywhere
<br>
high on his list. Another thing he'd never heard about was the relative readability
<br>
of serif versus sans-serif fonts. He seemed eager to hear more about that, though, so
<br>
I sent him some pointers.
<br>
<p>Another thing I wish I had was an &quot;actual page&quot; tachistoscope layout, where a bright
<br>
box bumps down a representation of (say) an HTML whole page.
<br>
<p>The AceReader guy has several patents on file. I have mixed feelings about that.
<br>
<p>Lastly, screen resolutions still suck for reading. 72 dpi is hard on the eyes.
<br>
At about 200 dpi, we can hope for better reading. IBM shipped a few flat panels
<br>
with that kind of rez to some universities a couple of years ago, based on some
<br>
copper-matrx tech, but I haven't heard anything else about them since.
<br>
<p>The main effect I observe (even when speeding through paper) seems to be a flattening
<br>
out of things like imagery. In one of the Mike Lorrey example passages, I get slate
<br>
and steel grey as words, not as images, when I read it fast. So it's not an approach
<br>
I'd choose for enjoyment, though I might still score high in &quot;comprehension&quot; testing.
