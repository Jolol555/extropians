<p><em>&gt; I am still haunted by the point made by an acquaintance

</em><br>
<em>&gt; or 3rd stage (I forget) from going into orbit themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His point was that ordinary rocket journeys into space should
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you think about that?
</em><br>
<p><p>Re-used?  Pah!  Re-used by whom?  NASA builds its stuff new for each
<br>
mission, and would sooner see its detritus - spent rocket stages et al -
<br>
burn in re-entry than fall into the hands of someone who might actually
<br>
use them for something.  (Unless you count, say, letting them gathering
<br>
dust in a museum as &quot;using&quot;.)
<br>
<p>Now, if you were launching your own rockets, then this might be viable.
<br>
But most of these arguments boil down to, &quot;Come on, NASA, it really
<br>
wouldn't cost you much to leave the scrap up there for us to use,&quot; which
<br>
invitations NASA declines without responding to the arguments.  Frankly,
<br>
NASA seems to be a little frightened by the possibility of serious space
<br>
work being done by Americans without NASA's involvement, which twists
<br>
this argument from their point of view into something like, &quot;Come on,
<br>
NASA, it really wouldn't cost you much to just leave these knives where
<br>
we can grab them so we can stab you to death.&quot;  So of course they're
<br>
going to say no without even considering the merits, until and unless
<br>
one can convince them to support NASA-less American space in the first
<br>
place, which is a tough sell since it would most likely lead to a
<br>
diminished NASA (or, from our point of view, a non-bloated NASA - but
<br>
remember it's their point of view, not ours, that determines their
<br>
actions).
