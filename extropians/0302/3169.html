From: Mike Lorrey [mailto:<a href="mailto:mlorrey@yahoo.com?Subject=RE:%20spreading%20democracy%20(was:%20Bush%20budget%20has%200%20dollars%20for%20Afghanistan)">mlorrey@yahoo.com</a>]

<em>&gt; Do muslim people have a greater or lesser desire for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy than those in the west? It seems to me and many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others that muslim nations can't seem to have democracy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without going off the deep end into religious fundamentalism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which has a tendency to like to attack the West, esp with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism). Iran is merely one of the longer lasting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples. Turkey is living under a fundamentalist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration, while Algeria dealt with elections that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selected fundies as well. Egyptian democrats are also almost 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all radical fundies. What gives?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems like the only moderates are benign despots who are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; western educated (Jordan's Hussein, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc) and who have to deal with significant fundie threats 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within their countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What say you?
</em><br>
<p>Well, while Turkey and Algeria have seen religious conservatives make
<br>
headway in recent elections, they've at least *had* meaningful
<br>
elections.  If Pat Robertson were elected President of the United
<br>
States, it would be a very sad day, but the US would still be a
<br>
democracy.  
<br>
<p>(As an aside, the leading Egyptian pro-democracy forces are also
<br>
fairly pro-US.  Egypt just sent an Egyptian-american democracy
<br>
advocate to prison for criticizing the government, then released him
<br>
when the US complained.)
<br>
<p>More generally, I think fundamentalist religions flourish among poor,
<br>
oppressed, uneducated people.  The moderates you mention are still
<br>
mostly oppressors of their countrymen who sit at the head of corrupt
<br>
bureaucracies that steal from the citizenry at every opportunity.  
<br>
<p>Imagine yourself as a poor laborer in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait.  You see
<br>
the vast palaces and the rolls royces.  You've watched reruns of
<br>
&quot;Dallas&quot; and know that all americans live as kings.  You have
<br>
absolutely 0 hope of elevating yourself in your country or making any
<br>
kind of difference through legal means.  The only media you can access
<br>
are owned by your king.  You can't speak out against your government
<br>
without being imprisoned or worse.  Your children are likely to know
<br>
the same poverty and bondage that you know.
<br>
<p>In that kind of context, can you see why fundamentalism and terrorism
<br>
would both flourish?
<br>
<p>That's why I'm a believer in spreading democracy, education, civil
<br>
liberties, and capitalism through the world.  Ultimately I believe
<br>
these forces are more powerful than their adversaries.  With a little
<br>
assistance they can spread to the remaining dark corners of the world.
<br>
That would be a good thing for everyone.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
