<p>
We have often discussed Doug Lenat's AI project, Cyc, an attempt to
<br>
incorporate &quot;common sense&quot; into computers by building an immense database
<br>
of general purpose knowledge.  I was surprised to read in this CNN
<br>
article, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/12/total.information.ap/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/12/total.information.ap/index.html</a>,
<br>
that Cycorp is getting involved in the infamous TIA program:
<br>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, contractors and researchers told The Associated Press that
<br>
they have already been developing pieces of TIA. For example, Doug Lenat,
<br>
president of Texas-based Cycorp, said his researchers had already built
<br>
a system to identify phone-calling patterns as they might exist among
<br>
potential terrorists overseas.&quot;
<br>
<p>TIA is the Total Information Awareness program, which has been
<br>
widely discussed and criticized on the web.  The CNN article is
<br>
kind of strange especially after reading in the NY Times today,
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/12/politics/12PRIV.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/12/politics/12PRIV.html</a>, that Congress
<br>
has agreed to new restrictions on the project: TIA cannot be used
<br>
against Americans and that no more research can be done without extensive
<br>
consultation with Congress.  (Note - you can buy your TIA logo gear here,
<br>
<a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/totalawareness">http://www.cafeshops.com/totalawareness</a>)
<br>
<p>Personally I have always been skeptical of Cyc, so I don't know whether
<br>
to be alarmed or relieved at the prospect of this technology being used
<br>
for the TIA project.  On the one hand, if it doesn't work, that might
<br>
help keep TIA from going forward.  On the other hand, they might proceed
<br>
anyway with a malfunctioning AI that spews out all kinds of false alarms
<br>
and random data.  It could lead to situations like in Terry Gilliam's
<br>
satirical movie Brazil where innocents are dragged away by storm troopers
<br>
after a computer malfunction.
