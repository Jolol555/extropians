<p>The answer to this will very much depend on (1) who you ask and (2) when 
<br>
do you ask. The answer from Mr. Bush and his gang will probably be yes. 
<br>
Maybe re-elected, even with billions of dollars in debts, the chance to 
<br>
rearrange the oil business within the next decade (after being 
<br>
president), a good cover-up for the other mistakes he made. The average 
<br>
american tax payer may give another answer - two years after the war. 
<br>
Higher taxes, less money for the people, more money for military and 
<br>
&quot;security&quot;. Less political freedom, higher risk of terrorism, etc. The 
<br>
average Iraqi tax payer will probably say the same, but he'll also miss 
<br>
the infrastructure, schools, medical service, food, etc. The real 
<br>
winners will be the bad guys. With the US in Iraq, the Saudis and others 
<br>
will push even more money to the many warrior groups in the region and 
<br>
maybe also to international terrorist groups, to draw the attention of 
<br>
the US government onto another spot. Sudan perhaps or Indonesia or some 
<br>
other heavy strikes in NY, LA or so.
<br>
<p>So, how would you define &quot;foreign policy mistake&quot;?
<br>
<p>And BTW, the fact that some person should be removed from power doesn't 
<br>
automatically justify the use of military force against this person, 
<br>
it's country and/or the people there. If that would be the case, Mr. 
<br>
Bush should be very, very careful...
