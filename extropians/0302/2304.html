Research has shown that levodopa can increase the risk of heart disease in
<br>
Parkinson's patients.
<br>
January 30, 2003 3:58 PM GMT (Datamonitor) - A study published in the Archives
<br>
of Neurology suggests a link between levodopa and increased homocysteine
<br>
levels. This new evidence of adverse side effects will increase the demand for
<br>
treatments that can delay the need for levodopa.

...patients with Parkinson disease (PD) may have elevated homocysteine 
<br>
levels resulting from methylation of levodopa and dopamine by catechol 
<br>
O-methyltransferase, an enzyme that uses S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl 
<br>
donor and yields S-adenosylhomocysteine. Since S-adenosylhomocysteine is 
<br>
rapidly converted to homocysteine, levodopa therapy may put patients at 
<br>
increased risk for vascular disease by raising homocysteine levels...
<br>
Patients whose homocysteine levels were in the higher quartile  had

increased prevalence of CAD (relative risk, 1.75...

... Specific questions include:
<br>
1) does selegiline offer neuroprotection;
<br>
2) what is the best agent with which to initiate symptomatic treatment in 
<br>
de novo PD...
<br>
Using evidence-based principles, a literature review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
<br>
and the Cochrane Library was performed to identify all human trials in de 
<br>
novo PD between 1966and 1999. Only articles that fulfilled class I or class 
<br>
II evidence were included.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this review, the authors conclude:
<br>
1) Selegiline has very mild symptomatic benefit (level A, class II 
<br>
evidence) with no evidence for neuroprotective benefit(level U, class II 
<br>
evidence).
<br>
2) For PD patients requiring initiation of symptomatic therapy, either 
<br>
levodopa or a DA can be used (level A, class I and class II evidence). 
<br>
Levodopa provides superior motor benefit but is associated with a higher 
<br>
risk of dyskinesia.
<br>
<p>Ideally, if a drug were available, initial treatment of PD should slow 
<br>
disease progression. Once symptomatic benefit is required, treatment should 
<br>
reduce disability without inducing complications over the long term.
<br>
<p>4. Dopamine agonists are effective for all features of the disease, but are 
<br>
not generally as effective as levodopa and are more expensive than 
<br>
levodopa(class I, II).
<br>
5. Selegiline. Class I evidence suggests a mild therapeutic and partial 
<br>
protective effect from selegiline,but confirmation of the neuroprotective 
<br>
effect is needed. Selegiline also has antidepressant activity that offers 
<br>
modest direct symptomatic benefit for PD
<br>
<p>The goal of treatment should be to obtain an optimal reduction of 
<br>
parkinsonism with a minimal risk of long-term side effects.
<br>
<p>Given the controversy generated by the report of Lees et al. that mortality 
<br>
was increased in patients with PD taking selegiline, studies utilizing 
<br>
selegiline in patients already receiving symptomatic therapy were included 
<br>
to address the safety of selegiline in this patient population.
<br>
<p>Selegiline.What is the role of selegiline in the treatment of early PD?A 
<br>
neuroprotective benefit of selegiline through decreased free radical 
<br>
production was proposed and resulted in the DATATOP (Deprenyl and 
<br>
Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism) clinical trial.
<br>
There is no convincing evidence for increased mortality with selegiline 
<br>
whether it is given in combination with levodopa or as monotherapy (class II).
<br>
<p>Recommendations for patients with PD who require symptomatic treatment
<br>
* Initial symptomatic treatment of patients with PD with selegiline in 
<br>
order to confer mild,symptomatic benefit prior to the institution of 
<br>
dopaminergic therapy may be considered (level A, class II evidence).
<br>
* There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of selegiline to 
<br>
confer neuroprotection in patients with PD (level U).
<br>
<p>Conclusions. Cabergoline, ropinirole, and pramipexole treatment of PD 
<br>
patients requiring dopaminergic therapy results in fewer motor 
<br>
complications(wearing off, dyskinesias, on-off motor fluctuations)than 
<br>
levodopa treatment after 2.5 years of follow-up.Cabergoline, ropinirole, 
<br>
and pramipexole treatment of PD patients requiring dopaminergic therapy is 
<br>
associated with more frequent adverse events including hallucinations, 
<br>
somnolence, and edema than levodopa therapy.
<br>
Recommendations. In patients with PD who require the initiation of 
<br>
dopaminergic treatment, either levodopa or a dopamine agonist may be used. 
<br>
The choice depends on the relative impact of improving motor disability 
<br>
(better with levodopa) compared with the lessening of motor complications 
<br>
(better with dopamine agonists) for each individual patient with PD (level 
<br>
A,class I and class II evidence).
