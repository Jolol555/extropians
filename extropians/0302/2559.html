BART isn't private.  Sorry.  It's a governmental entity, even though 
<br>
it's neither city, county, nor state.  All the members of the BART board 
<br>
of directors are public officials, either ex officio, or via direct 
<br>
appointment (I don't think any are electec, unlike the bus system).
<br>
<p>However, BART is a system built after GM lobbied successfully to uproot 
<br>
the previous Key System, which was private (with lots of government 
<br>
assistance).  But during the 1950's GM managed to get it pulled apart, 
<br>
the tracks torn up, and the cars sold off.  (In southern calif. GM 
<br>
actually bought control of the transit company, but I don't remember 
<br>
that they had to do that with the Key system.)  Still, BART is a 
<br>
government entity that was put in to replace a service that had been 
<br>
destroyed by private competition.  The service was needed, and busses 
<br>
just couldn't do the job.  (It took me 4 hours to get from Berkeley to 
<br>
Sunnyvale on the bus services that replaced the key system.  That's 
<br>
about 4 times as long as it takes if one drives.  There isn't a direct 
<br>
route via transit any longer.)
<br>
<p>Footnote:  The four hour trip involved AC Transit, a 7 block walk, 
<br>
Greyhound, and then a wait for someone to pick me up, or a 20 block 
<br>
walk.  Not easy if you are carrying very much.  OTOH, Sunnyvale is an 
<br>
unfair example.  It was designed from nearly the start to be auto 
<br>
friendly.  It is, or was, relatively low density housing, with few 
<br>
businesses.  A very poor design for a transit area.  As the density 
<br>
increases it becomes more hospitable to transit.  (I wish it wouldn't, 
<br>
but it's already too late, as the orchards are gone, and the new housing 
<br>
going in is all condos.)  But were a decent mass transit system in place 
<br>
I estimate that it would take about an hour to make the same trip.  (It 
<br>
covers 2/3s of the distance, and that trip takes about half an hour, 
<br>
once you reach the transit station.)
<br>
Still, this isn't a good example for mass transit.  Not yet.  But from 
<br>
San Jose to San Francisco is.  And people who make the trip regularly 
<br>
tend to prefer the train, because it's faster and less hassle.  (To be 
<br>
fair, that should be &quot;some people who make the trip regularly&quot;.  But 
<br>
enough to take a lot of load off of the highways, and to keep the tracks 
<br>
quite busy.)
