</em><br>
<p>I do not necessarily agree with your conclusion, given that US support of 
<br>
&quot;friendly dictators&quot; in South Korea, Greece, and the Philippines, among other 
<br>
Cold War proxies, all lasted for several decades and in each case ended in 
<br>
democracy coming to those nations through the heroic efforts of the people in 
<br>
the countries involved, not through the directive of the United States. And a 
<br>
nation that did reach democracy through directive, Japan, was still seen in 
<br>
Cold War terms first. Our support of these regimes did not lead to lasting 
<br>
and bitter hatred of the US in these countries. However, this policy did 
<br>
serve both the long term and short term interests of both the United States 
<br>
and the countries in question, as these countries did not fall under the 
<br>
banner of communism and eventually embraced democracy. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I could go on.  Suffice it to say, US foreign policy has not been one
<br>
of encouraging the spread of democracy and capitalism to the rest of
<br>
the world.  Much the opposite.  I would welcome a foreign policy that
<br>
was actually consistent with the principles this country was founded
<br>
on.&quot;
<br>
<p>This gets to the heart of my problem with your argument. To suggest that the 
<br>
United States has had a foreign policy which has been &quot;the opposite&quot; of one 
<br>
that spreads democracy and capitalism is in my view at best unfair, if not 
<br>
dishonest. Especially when compared, for example, to those European nations 
<br>
that now criticize and oppose the US efforts vis-a-vis Iraq. You pile on the 
<br>
US decisions to support authoritarians abroad during the Cold War, without 
<br>
putting those decisions in any kind of historical perspective. Where is a 
<br>
nation that has a better track record? With all due respect, I don't believe 
<br>
Gamal Abdel Nasser's efforts in Yemen were about bringing that country 
<br>
&quot;democracy and capitalism.&quot;
<br>
<p>Let me say now that I believe you and I are looking toward the same thing, a 
<br>
free and democratic Iraq. Our disagreement comes, it seems, in whether or not 
<br>
the United States can achieve this while acting in its own interests first. 
<br>
The United States interevened in Afghanistan not for the sake of the Afghani 
<br>
people, but for our own defensive concerns. Nonetheless, the people of 
<br>
Afghanistan have and will continue to benefit from this action. 
<br>
<p>I am of the opinion that US action in Iraq will have the same benefits for 
<br>
the Iraqi people, all the while satisfying our internal interests. I am also 
<br>
of the opinion, and only time will tell the validity of it, that in the 
<br>
post-Soviet world, the US will be able to be more patient and allow more 
<br>
democratic personalities to come to the fore. I think this has already been 
<br>
seen with Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan as caretaker. This was not a luxury we 
<br>
had in the Cold War world, where in most cases democracy was a foreign 
<br>
concept. To sit idly by and hope that it took hold in a place like South 
<br>
Korea or Greece would have meant forfeiting that nation. I cannot abide your 
<br>
bashing of US decisions to support bullies and petty tyrants like Syngman 
<br>
Rhee or Lon Nol. The choice was not between authoritarianism and democracy. 
<br>
The choice was between authoritarianism and worse.
<br>
<p>I for one do agree with your assertion that it will require a prolonged US 
<br>
effort to see that a vibrant and free Iraq comes to pass. It is my opinion 
<br>
and my hope that they will be engaged in making the process work. However, 
<br>
the first steps on that road do not need to be paved with altruism. 
<br>

<p>&quot;Americans are very interesting people. When you came here in 1945, we had 
<br>
all the Communists in jail. You made us let them all out. Now you tell us to 
<br>
to put them back in jail again. That's a lot of work, you know.&quot;
