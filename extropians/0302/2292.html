<em>&gt;&gt; That is part of what I was getting at when I said that micro cars
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lead to a different style of driving. 'Aggressive' drivers won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; last long in a micro.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I guess here in Italy we are all going to die :-))
</em><br>
<p>Alfio makes a good point: the traffic fatality rate in Italy is
<br>
about 12 per 100,000; in the US it's about 15.  So &quot;safety&quot; can't
<br>
be the primary explanation for the absence of micros from the US
<br>
market.  Perceived safety, perhaps.
<br>
<p>I admit that when I got my present job, I traded in my Dodge Neon
<br>
(a compact, but not micro--indeed, it's about the only car in the
<br>
price range I could fit into) for a Subaru Forester, a mid-sized
<br>
SUV with very high safety ratings.  It didn't hurt my gas mileage
<br>
much either: the Neon was bad as compacts go (about 35 mpg), and
<br>
the Forester very good as SUVs go (about 30 mpg).
<br>
<p>While I certainly make no apologies for exercising the right to
<br>
spend my own money on my own safety, the question remains as to
<br>
whether the investment is a rational one.  If had instead bought
<br>
a 90 mpg hybrid car, which was available when I bought the SUV,
<br>
would the amount of money I saved on gas (which is considerable,
<br>
since I drive about 30,000 miles a year) have been better spent
<br>
on increasing my safety in some other way?
