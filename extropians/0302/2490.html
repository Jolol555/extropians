<p><p><em>&gt; A very good question indeed, Samantha.  As a teenager I often took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child-sitting jobs because a) I got paid to sit quietly, studying and b)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I enjoyed being with children.  Nothing weird about that: I had grown up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a family surrounded by younger children, and as a teenager had moved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from home - and found I missed the kids.  When I hit twenty years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old, one parent asked me: &quot;Don't you ever worry about being considered a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pervert?&quot; (not nastily, just asking)  It quite shook me up, I can tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you.  I answered: &quot;Well, no.  Do you think I should worry?&quot;  The Mother
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shook her head, and left for an evening out with her husband.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; night, for the first time ever, I felt a twinge of discomfort when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading a bed-time story to a child.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>It is even more sad when as the parent of a child you feel that doing 
<br>
something normal such as bathing them, you are somehow doing something wrong. 
<br>
The current hysterical state of Pedomania that dominates the press is doing 
<br>
damage to healthy people's minds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is saddening to see people raise eyebrows over bed-sharing, and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see it especially often when the adult is male.  When an adult shares a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bed with a child, it seems the current default assumption is: 'looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for sexual jollies'.  It used to be: 'providing comfort and warmth'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What went wrong?  Is society becoming more cynical?
</em><br>

<p>I draw the line at sharing a bed with my children, let alone anyone else's. 
<br>
However this is purely for reasons of getting a good night sleep. If one of 
<br>
them woke me up I would surely batter them and that would be a different 
<br>
crime altogether.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is strange that if you fell asleep with a child on a sofa, that is 
<br>
perfectly expectable. It just proves the Bed=Sex mentality.
