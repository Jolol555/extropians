It looks like the march of technology (used loosely as a
<br>
combination of hardware and software evolution) is driving
<br>
us forward ever faster.
<br>
<p>Harder Working Transistors Through Automated FPGA Compiling
<br>
<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/02/030225070139.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/02/030225070139.htm</a>
<br>
<p>I went to a conference roughly 4-5 years ago in Paris where
<br>
these techniques were just beginning to be explored.  It appears
<br>
a fair amount of progress has been made.
<br>
<p>The bottom line for people unfamiliar with the technology
<br>
is that it may allow your computer to &quot;adapt&quot; its hardware
<br>
to the application you are running in real time.  This is
<br>
somewhat different from the Transmeta approach.  The Transmeta
<br>
optimizations, are I believe, are based on statistical observations
<br>
and adaptations of the rather inefficient 8086 architecture
<br>
to a more optimal architecture.  The FPGA approach actually
<br>
involves designing (and manufacturing on the fly) a better
<br>
architecture for the application.
<br>
<p>Also of interest is &quot;One such system has actually been realized
<br>
by an ISI team including Hall and Diniz. That chip, a &quot;Processor
<br>
in Memory&quot; chip called DIVA, is now being investigated under a grant
<br>
from DARPA for integration into a HP system.&quot;
<br>
<p>So PIM hasn't &quot;died&quot; -- it has just been hibernating for a while.
<br>
This one of the key computer architectural innovations that was
<br>
necessary for IBM's &quot;Blue Gene&quot; project.  The article suggests
<br>
that it may be migrating from supercomputer class machines to
<br>
desktop class machines.
<br>
<p>The net of the comments is that they suggest that distributed
<br>
computing projects, e.g. folding@home, lets-evolve-a-rogue-AI@home,
<br>
etc. will become much more capable during this decade.
