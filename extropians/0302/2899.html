I used to use these things a lot, and found Odigo to be an excellent
<br>
cross-service client. It has it's own netork, and used to talk Yahoo &amp; AIM
<br>
very well when I used it. It's only problem was that it didn't talk to the
<br>
MSNMessenger network, which was the one I had the most contacts on; these
<br>
days, it appears to include MSNMessenger too. www.odigo.com
<br>
<p>(btw, anyone who is interested can get to me on MSNMessenger using
<br>
emlyn_oregan@hotmail.com. Don't email me at that address, I never check the
<br>
email on it).

<em>&gt; Some of us have found that emailing with a member of the list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be very effective, and in many cases helps improve the list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signal to noise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Something to consider.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once direct contact has been made, people may choose to allow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via IM.  I use it every day, but limit access only to people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I already know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIM, Yahoo, and ICQ are very popular but don't inter-operate with each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other.  There's also Jabber which is trying to promote its own open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard, and there are others, such as Trillian, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to provide a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common front end to access more than one service. A newcomer that I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watching is VeriChat, that attempts to provide full-time presence on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple IM services with client being on your mobile phone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or wireless PDA.
