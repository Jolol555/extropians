<em>&gt; John,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        The market advisors say that if you predict a price level never give a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; date and if you predict a date never give a price level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Evidently Herman Kahn should have also studied the tactics of market 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advisors. LOL
</em><br>
<p>Actually, that he didn't and made predictions that eventually
<br>
didn't pan out reflects well on him. There are plenty of
<br>
&quot;forecasters&quot; that make statements that won't tell you anything
<br>
useful about the future, and that mainly fit after the fact.
<br>
The preface starts (I am translating here from the Swedish
<br>
translation I happen to have): &quot;This book does not constitute a
<br>
complete compilation of &quot;guesses&quot; about all important aspects
<br>
of the future; even less it is an attempt to &quot;predict&quot; the
<br>
future in any particular way&quot;. The goal of the book was mainly
<br>
methodological, and it does spend a lot of time analysing what
<br>
future studies are and what they should deal with. It was in
<br>
many ways the start of a current of thinking that is important
<br>
today.
<br>
<p>Their list of &quot;100 very probable technological innovations in
<br>
the last third of the 20th century&quot; is fun reading. Just as an
<br>
example (since a criticism of the meat of the book would take
<br>
too long):
<br>
<p>Misses: extensive rational agriculture in the tropics, direct
<br>
conversion of nuclear power to electric power (nuclear
<br>
batteries come close), cargo submarines, extensive use of
<br>
cyborgisation, short-term cryonics for medical purposes,
<br>
controllable high-efficiency sleep, agriculture or mining of
<br>
the seas, the use of nuclear explosives for mining and channel
<br>
construction, acceptance and general use of synthetic foods,
<br>
physiologically safe recreational drugs, permanent
<br>
moonbase/space habitation, mechanical or chemical intelligence
<br>
enhancement methods, one-man flying machines for short range
<br>
flights, general access to transuranic elements, planned
<br>
dreams, new methods for fast language learning. 
<br>
<p>Too optimistic about: super airplanes, new power sources for
<br>
cars, body weight control, new animal and plant species,
<br>
widespread use of geodesic cupolas and similar structures, 3D
<br>
photography and movies, the automated home, limited weather
<br>
control, genetic control of personality, new methods and
<br>
institutions for child rearing and education, life extension,
<br>
widespread use of robotics, undeground buildings, commercial
<br>
extraction of oil from shale, widespread desalination,
<br>
widespread use of fluidistors, solettas,
<br>
<p>The last category is mainly about stuff that is technologically
<br>
feasible but has not panned out economically. Some of it has
<br>
advanced more slowly than expected. Some were made obsolete,
<br>
like fluidistors. 
<br>
<p>Several of the things in the first category also exist to a
<br>
degree - we have lucid dreaming and some intelligence
<br>
amplification, we could use nuclear charges for digging if
<br>
there was a political will, prosthetics approach much of what
<br>
he called cyborgisation and so on. It is just that they are not
<br>
everywhere, and mostly confined to the lab or very special
<br>
applications. It is notable how many of these things belong to
<br>
*our* list of things we expect. Plus ca change, plus c'est la
<br>
meme chose :-)
<br>
<p>When I count this list, I find 16 clear misses and 17 too
<br>
optimistic cases, leaving 67 more or less right &quot;predictions&quot;. 
<br>
They got cheap and fairly easily obtained weapons of mass
<br>
destruction, widespread use of mobile phones and much of
<br>
internetworking right.  When
<br>
<p>I think it is worthwhile to read it and learn from it. The
<br>
misses are perhaps not as interesting as *why* they were
<br>
misses. For example, they assumes technological centralisation
<br>
to work, while thinking that it is easy to get people to accept
<br>
radical new technologies - the common technocratic mistake,
<br>
less obvious in 1967 than today but still common.  This is why
<br>
no safe recreational drugs have been developed: social norms
<br>
proved resistant, and instead of spending money on making drugs
<br>
safe money was spent on combatting it. Similarly it is too
<br>
optimistic about the use of genetic engineering; already in 67
<br>
it was clear what was on the horizon, but the sociocultural
<br>
context that came to control the technology proved different. 
<br>
<p>The book is tied to the club of Rome style worry about resource
<br>
limitations and overpopulation as the main drivers of social
<br>
change, against very typical for its time, and this biases many
<br>
predictions.  There is currently no need for oil from shale or
<br>
mining the seas.  
<br>
<p>Similarly the cold war was still interminable, and Soviet
<br>
really did seem to be a viable (or even *more* viable)
<br>
alternative to the West. The chapter on the future of the world
<br>
political system is interesting.  They point out that an
<br>
indefinite arms race is unlikely, but that future weapons of
<br>
mass destruction will be in the hands of irresponsible
<br>
governments. They discuss the trends of international anarchy
<br>
and governance, pointing out that they can move in many
<br>
directions at once (as we have seen). Their list of basic
<br>
structural changes does indeed miss the possibility that one of
<br>
the superpowers could crash on its own - it assumes that any
<br>
loss of power has to be due to either conquest/destruction or
<br>
delegation to international power. Very revealing of the way
<br>
people thought then - and now too, if we compare with
<br>
predictions about the future of the US, EU and UN. 
<br>
<p>To sum up, _The Year 2000_ is healthy reading. It manages to be
<br>
both a historical document about how people thought in 67, a
<br>
paradigm study in academic forecasting, and a good mirror to
<br>
compare our world in.
