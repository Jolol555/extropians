This may be of interest to some. I received this letter from the Library of 
<br>
Congress:
<br>
<p>The upshot is currently when you send your 3 or 7 or whatever copies
<br>
of your book or publication to a central HQ library/depository for preservation 
<br>
for posterity, it is not scanned. Currently.
<br>
<p>Would opening up technical-scientific books/journals further speed the
<br>
Singularity?
<br>
<p>&quot;Dear Avatar Polymorph,
<br>
<p>The Library of Congress has already scanned parts of its collections and 
<br>
made them available via the World Wide Web.  Here are some of the things 
<br>
scanned to date and made available via the Library's World Wide web site:
<br>
<p>* Selected books about the Library of Congress originally published by the 
<br>
Library.  Some are available here &lt;<a href="http://www.loc.gov/about/books/">http://www.loc.gov/about/books/</a>&gt;;
<br>
* Selected American History and culture materials via the American Memory 
<br>
Historical Collections &lt;<a href="http://memory.loc.gov">http://memory.loc.gov</a>&gt;.  These comprise more than 
<br>
eight million digital files;
<br>
* Current and recent (1973-present) congressional materials 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov">http://thomas.loc.gov</a>&gt;;
<br>
* Books and studies, originally published by the Library's Federal Research 
<br>
Division &lt;<a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/">http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/</a>&gt;;
<br>
* Selected copyright-free materials requested by other institutions 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/rr/loan/illscanhome.html">http://lcweb.loc.gov/rr/loan/illscanhome.html</a>&gt;;
<br>
* Selected prints and photographs 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/catalog.html">http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/catalog.html</a>&gt;; and
<br>
* Other materials via the Library's conservation and preservation programs 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.loc.gov/preserv/prd/presdig/prestoc.html">http://www.loc.gov/preserv/prd/presdig/prestoc.html</a>&gt;.
<br>
<p>In some cases, these categories overlap.
<br>
<p>The Library of Congress is considering a wide array of other digital 
<br>
projects.  Materials that are converted to digital form for use only within 
<br>
the confines of the Library of Congress buildings are scanned with either 
<br>
the permission of the rights holders or under the &quot;fair use&quot; exceptions to 
<br>
copyright law.  Some of the digital surrogates of photographs presented in 
<br>
the Library's Prints and Photographs Catalog, for example, may only be 
<br>
viewed by researchers within the Library's buildings.  And selections of 
<br>
manuscript materials from the Hannah Arendt collection are available in 
<br>
computer form only from within the Library of Congress Manuscript Reading 
<br>
Room.  Other selections are available via American Memory (here &lt; 
<br>
<a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/arendthtml/">http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/arendthtml/</a>&gt;).  Of course, since the Library of 
<br>
Congress is home to the United States Copyright Office, the Library must 
<br>
follow the law to the letter.  The must also carefully adhere to the 
<br>
restrictions on materials placed by the materials' donors and their 
<br>
heirs.  These agreements are a particular issue when a prominent person 
<br>
donates or sells his or her personal or professional papers to the Library 
<br>
of Congress.
<br>
<p>Some general information about may of the above programs, plus some 
<br>
information and a link to the National Digital Information Infrastructure 
<br>
and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) are here: 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.loc.gov/library/libarch-digital.html">http://www.loc.gov/library/libarch-digital.html</a>&gt;.  The NDIIPP is 
<br>
investigating all sorts of issues relating to the digital conversion of 
<br>
analog materials as well as the conservation of materials which are &quot;born 
<br>
digital.&quot;.  This is a new field of study and most of the answers are still 
<br>
unknown.&quot;
