<em>&gt; Yep, I think Mike's case is a bit overstated.  There can be, and has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been, successful private profit-making mass transit.  One I remember,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; was taken over by force and replaced with a government system.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was sold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the public as a way to make the system cheaper and ensure that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would cover outlying areas that the successful private system didn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It does in fact now cover more areas than the private system did, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is now more expensive and far less reliable.
</em><br>
<p>I suppose I should qualify my remarks, though I see that I DID say
<br>
&quot;public&quot;, as in 'publicly owned'. Privately owned mass transit can and
<br>
does make a profit in many markets. I happen to work for one: Vermont
<br>
Transit, which is currently the only profitable unit in Greyhound (the
<br>
profit taking may spread more if Amtrack is ever let die like it
<br>
should).
<br>
<p>In fact, Vermont Transit, back in the 1920's, ran a competetive
<br>
publicly owned trolley service into the ground. They celebrated by
<br>
torching the last trolley in Burlington in a public bonfire....
<br>
<p>The company does, though, receive subsidies from state and federal
<br>
governments, though these subsidies are ONLY for things that the state
<br>
wishes to mandate that we do, i.e. they pay for wheelchair lifts on the
<br>
buses, and they pay for extra buses to run unprofitable routes that the
<br>
state wants us to operate. We didn't ask for the money, but we did
<br>
insist on it when the gummint wanted us to do unprofitable things.
