Robert J. Bradbury says:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; IMO, sticking ones head in the sand and hoping the problem will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply &quot;go away&quot; isn't an extropic approach.  Go read the history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books on WWII to see how far that approach will get you.
</em><br>
<p>This kind of historical argument by analogy seems to embody the kind of
<br>
fallacy supporting belief in the power of prayer, `alternative medicine' and
<br>
Scientology: hey, I did X *and it worked*! As Robert obviously knows, that's
<br>
not a good way to test a claim. You need to look as well at cases where you
<br>
*didn't* do X *and it still worked*, and cases where you *did* do X *and it
<br>
didn't work*.
<br>
<p>So one might suggest, perhaps with equal force (but neither is a good
<br>
argument):
<br>
<p>IMO, sticking one's head in the sand and hoping the problem will simply &quot;go
<br>
away&quot; is an extropic approach.  Go read the history books on WWIII to see
<br>
how far that approach will get you.
<br>
<p>To unpack that a little: there were no nuclear exchanges of USA versus
<br>
Soviet Union during the long WWIII concluded around 1989. There were no
<br>
invasions of each other's territory (although there were obviously bloody
<br>
proxies). No American President invaded Russia at the very hub of its Axis
<br>
of Evil to remove any vile tyrant and his weapons of mass destruction. And
<br>
look what happened as a result of this puling cowardice! ...erm, the Soviet
<br>
Union fell apart.
<br>
<p>I'm NOT saying that this has any direct resonance with US[or UN] v Iraq. I'm
<br>
not even saying it's a particularly exact account of what happened with
<br>
US[or Free World] v Communist Menace. I am suggesting that `Go read the
<br>
history books on WWII to see how far that approach will get you' has limited
<br>
value as an argument.
