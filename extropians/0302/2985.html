Fly me to the Moon

&quot;In 1618 Johannes Kepler completed a motet, successfully re-creating
<br>
the harmonious chord calculated from the ratios of the planets' orbits to
<br>
the sun.
<br>
<p>In 1852 the painter Hermann Goldschmidt made the first of his fourteen
<br>
asteroid discoveries from a small room in a café in Paris.
<br>
<p>Inspired by these brilliant and slightly odd people, Alun Ward has created Fly
<br>
me to the Moon, a Flash installation which uses random methods to drive
<br>
asteroids across a projected screen. As they pass by on their lonely journeys,
<br>
they seem to generate sounds. Human and extraterrestrial noises coincide on
<br>
the otherwise silent screen, and a new music of the spheres is born.&quot;

&quot;Natural Radio&quot; describes naturally-occurring electromagnetic (radio)
<br>
signals emanating from lightning storms, aurora (The Northern and
<br>
Southern Lights), and most importantly, the Earth's magnetic-field (the
<br>
Magnetosphere).
<br>
<p>This is a presentation of Earth's natural radio emissions that occur in
<br>
the extremely-low-frequency to very-low-frequency (ELF-VLF) radio
<br>
spectrum--specifically, at AUDIO frequencies between approximately 100
<br>
to 10,000 cycles-per second (0.1 - 10 kHz).
<br>
<p>Unlike sound waves which are vibrations of air molecules that our ears
<br>
are sensitive to, natural radio waves are vibrations of electric and
<br>
magnetic energy (electromagnetic waves) which--though occurring at the
<br>
same frequencies as sound--cannot be listened to without an
<br>
audio-frequency ELF-VLF radio receiver to convert the natural radio
<br>
signals directly into the same sound frequencies. Another amazing realm
<br>
of nature is thus ready to be explored and observed.
<br>
<p>Naturally-occurring VLF radio emissions are being studied both via
<br>
ground-based receiving systems as well as orbiting spacecraft
<br>
receivers. &quot;

<p>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands - For years, Rene Veenema says he made a
<br>
small fortune selling real estate plots on the moon. Now he's in
<br>
jail, on Earth.
<br>
<p>Veenema, 33, has been accused of fraud and forgery by prosecutors
<br>
investigating complaints from clients who said they paid for, but
<br>
never received, ownership certificates for their parcels of land
<br>
in space, the daily Telegraaf newspaper reported Tuesday.
<br>
<p>Veenema, who goes on trial next month, was quoted as saying he
<br>
made thousands of people happy before his business turned sour. He
<br>
claims he sold plots for around 1,500 euros ($1,600) each through
<br>
the U.S.-based firm Lunar Embassy.
<br>
<p>The American company has sold plots since 1996 to owners who
<br>
include Johnny Carson, Ed McMahon, David Letterman, Ed Asner,
<br>
Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. Since then, the moon has sold well
<br>
in Europe Ð last year the lots were a popular Valentine's Day gift
<br>
in Romania Ð even though few if any buyers can ever hope to set
<br>
foot on their property.
<br>
<p>The paper said Veenema was jailed several weeks ago and that
<br>
prosecutors are seeking damages in a suit brought by five
<br>
disappointed investors.
<br>
<p>&quot;Like most things I start up, the moon project had a promising
<br>
start. But when the rush failed to materialize Ð I had expected
<br>
tens of thousands of orders per month Ð I ordered a car, a house,
<br>
you name it,&quot; he was quoted as saying.
<br>
<p>&quot;In fact, I have been pulling this off for more than 10 years,&quot;
<br>
Veenema told the newspaper. &quot;My employers, my colleagues, my
<br>
ex-girlfriend, I conned them all.&quot;
<br>
<p>When he gets out of jail, Veenema said he intends to repay all
<br>
those he swindled and &quot;learn to stop lying and cheating.&quot;
