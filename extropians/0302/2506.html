<em>&gt; From: avatar [mailto:<a href="mailto:avatar@renegadeclothing.com.au?Subject=Re:%20Cosmology%20Question">avatar@renegadeclothing.com.au</a>] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Everything indicates a FASI or other SI will discover most of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the physics of the this-universe underlying-TOE in 2 decades, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possibly with final refinements in the decades following, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; depending on the Fermi Paradox.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really?  I'm skeptical.  What evidence do you have to support this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheers,
</em><br>

<p>There's not much point debating too much, there are those who will
<br>
upload (it's possible) and there's those who will augment (it's possible).
<br>
Some just believe continuity is important, some don't. Atomic/molecular
<br>
level software duplication is something that hasn't happened before with
<br>
sentient beings. Augmentation has only been of the very lowest order 
<br>
(surgigal procedures).
<br>
<p>Similarly with the Singularity. As an historian by training, I recognize the
<br>
Singularity in action. At a timeframe of 100,000 years it is unmistakeable.
<br>
<p>I base my believes on Drexler's assertion that engineering and software
<br>
programming nano-supercomputing will be available about the time that
<br>
assemblers are or before [eliminating software drag]. Also, I believe that 
<br>
an AI will be inherently more likely to achieve self-directed change because 
<br>
of its structure and the fact that this process will be inbuilt into it by humans. 
<br>
Augmented human SI is also possible but slower to be achieved.
<br>
<p>A FASI will be more likely to achieve a TOE-physics (underlying structure of
<br>
this unvierse) because it can assimilate information faster and from more sources
<br>
and cross-relate thought experiments.
<br>
<p>But if you believe that the various effects linked to Moore's law and population
<br>
growth and AI development and assembler tech and bush robot possiblities and 
<br>
so on are all going to happen in 50 years or 80, does this really make any
<br>
practical difference beyond preparing people? These things (TOE etc.) can be 
<br>
taken as fixed and culture will still rumble forward. People are people whether 
<br>
they can talk to a million colleagues or ten or one. The only thing that superintelligence
<br>
should bring is greater awareness of our common brotherhood.
<br>
<p>Interim longevity boosting/appearance enhancement will be possible in a dozen years,
<br>
certainly sufficient to last us to the Singularity.
<br>
<p>Note: I myself believe the Singularity is not full achieved locally until about 2350, but
<br>
that it's bulk occurs in just over 2 decades from now. That is, knowledge precedes full
<br>
activation. This delay may also be due to ethical concerns and individual rights.
