<em>&gt; &gt; I have noticed lately on Leno, Letterman etc that France

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nah. When I think of butts, I automatically picture a beady eyed beret
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clad fellow with a thin moustache and a sneer. Besides, there is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more than just the country to make jokes about: their military,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for instance,
</em><br>
<p>I think that the bad reputation of the French military
<br>
is mostly undeserved.  Their biggest mistakes are 
<br>
usually said to be
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* losing to the Germans in 1870, a fiasco
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Napoleon III
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the quick defeat in WWII by the Germans
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Dien Bien Phu
<br>
<p>The latter was just quite difficult, and a nation ten
<br>
years later---and with much more advanced fire power
<br>
---cannot be said to have had an easy time in a far
<br>
away country in Indochina either.
<br>
<p>France's inferiority to Germany during 1850 - 1950
<br>
is mostly attributable to the 3 to 2 numerical 
<br>
superiority of the Germans.
<br>
<p>But it's World War II that every one thinks about when
<br>
they sneer at the French.  Well, know this:  when war
<br>
was declared in September of 1939, France put 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOUR MILLION MEN
<br>
<p>on the line against Germany.  That was one-tenth of 
<br>
their population.  (It took the U.S. several years to
<br>
mobilize to that degree.)  Moreover, most of the French
<br>
units were first rate.  Individually, they even had
<br>
better tanks than the Germans.  But neither the units
<br>
nor the tanks got much of a chance to fight because 
<br>
after the Ardennes breakthrough, the situation was
<br>
hopeless strategically.
<br>
<p>Yes, there was Vichy, and the generalship in World War
<br>
Two wasn't good.  But they fought quite well in the first
<br>
world war.  I'll also concede the truth that their
<br>
methods and strategy (perhaps by bad luck) did overly
<br>
absorb the lessons of an earlier war, and failed to
<br>
be properly innovative.
