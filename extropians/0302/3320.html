<em>&gt; &gt; How can Chirac get away with this *within* France?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The way that question is phrased does not make any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense at all to me.  Try again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I for one applauded Chirac's comments.)
</em><br>
<p>As in an exchange with Samantha, it's noteworthy how, from
<br>
one ideological standpoint, something is obvious, and yet
<br>
the opponents cannot understand it at all---even when they
<br>
attempt to from within their adversaries belief system.  It
<br>
appears to escape *all* reasonableness.  (This is why it
<br>
crosses the minds of some that their opponents may be actually
<br>
&quot;insane&quot;.  Thanks for not saying that about me :-)
<br>
<p>What I mean is this: to many in the U.S. (or the Anglosphere?)
<br>
it seems overweening and arrogant for Chirac to say to the
<br>
hopeful entrants to the EU:  &quot;You must do as I say.  You may
<br>
not have your own opinion.  You will be sorry for speaking
<br>
your own opinions.  Just wait and see.&quot;
<br>
<p>In other words (from my perspective, and I'm sure, from many
<br>
around the world) this amounts to extortion or even blackmail.
<br>
Now my guess is that my ideological adversaries on the other
<br>
side will say, &quot;Talk about extortion!  Consider what the U.S.
<br>
and its allies are doing to Iraq for God's sake!&quot;.
<br>
<p>Well, to us, Iraq is an enemy, and so it's okay to threaten
<br>
and attack a true enemy (which you'll probably agree to the
<br>
logic of if not the particulars), but it's not okay to bully
<br>
equals.  For example, intimidating Iraq is okay, but if Bush
<br>
was to secretly say to the leader of Spain, &quot;you better sign
<br>
that letter or else you'll be sorry when it comes to the
<br>
next round of trade negotiations!&quot;, it would be ABSOLUTELY
<br>
DISASTROUS if that leaked out (as it invariably would).
<br>
It would be seen as attempting compulsion.
<br>
<p>Now, this is complex, because Spain does have an ulterior
<br>
motive in being nice to the U.S.  It all goes into the 
<br>
equations.  Likewise, Romania does have an ulterior motive
<br>
for being nice to France.  But the weighing of subtle
<br>
motives, and the strategies involved, is one thing---
<br>
blunt and crude statements like that of Chirac's strike
<br>
many of us as extremely obnoxious and high-handed.
<br>
<p>Don't Germans and French see it that way at all?
<br>
<p>Lee
