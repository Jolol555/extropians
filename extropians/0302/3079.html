This will be a reply to Daniel, Dennis and Lee based on some
<br>
incorporation of posts that have showed up on the Javien Forum
<br>
but not the ExI List itself (yet).
<br>
<p>Lee Corbin [<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20Dennis%20May%20replies/was%20Re:%20One%20solution%20to%20the%20Fermi%20Paradox">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>] wrote:

<p><em>&gt;At some early stages of the Von Neumann probe dispersal, this

</em><br>
<p>I would tend to agree with this.  The entire von Neumann probe
<br>
dispersal scenario seems very boring.  So you conquer every bit
<br>
of available matter -- so what?  You either have a very dumb
<br>
mechanical galaxy ruled by &quot;we shall control everything&quot; bots
<br>
or you have something more alive and evolving.  That allows
<br>
scenarios like the Klingon or Romulan civilizations to evolve.
<br>
That seems much more interesting.
<br>
<p>From Dennis:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Competition between groups, particularly given WoMD, will prevent every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speck of matter from being used.
</em><br>
<p>This statement demonstrates a lack of understanding of scale by Dennis.
<br>
Current WoMD are useless/irrelevant on stellar scales.
<br>
<p>One could explode all of the nuclear weapons that exist on our
<br>
planet today and it would hardly be noticed on a planet orbiting
<br>
around Alpha Centauri.
<br>
<p>The statement Dennis makes demonstrates a key lack of appreciation
<br>
for two facts of life:
<br>
&nbsp;a) the power output of a star vs. a typical WoMD
<br>
&nbsp;b) typical distances between stars and how long it is likely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to take to travel between them.
<br>
<p>Dennis makes an interesting observation with:
<br>
<em>&gt; With WoMD [geometric destruction] and geometric replication [von Neumann
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probes/biological systems] it is not obvious that there will ever be any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation where everything is used up.
</em><br>
<p>Discarding the geometric destruction card (Dennis clearly does not
<br>
make his case in this forum -- a Matrioshka Brain is managing 10^26 W)
<br>
In comparison, one megaton of TNT produces 4.2x10^15 joules and the
<br>
largest nuclear weapons ever designed produce about 100 times this
<br>
amount of energy.  So the largest WoMD ever imagined by human beings
<br>
still fall short of the power output of a star by about 7 orders of
<br>
magnitude.  It isn't even worth debating.
<br>
<p>There *will* be a situation where &quot;everything&quot; is used up.  It
<br>
may happen very very far in our future when we have had to resolve
<br>
whether or not the Romulan or Klingon civilization perspectives
<br>
might indeed be best.  I don't know.  But the assertion that
<br>
Dennis makes is clearly incorrect.  The expansion of civilizations
<br>
to fully utilize the resources avialable to them was made by Dyson
<br>
40+ years ago.  If we are going to be debating it now we need
<br>
much stronger arguments than Dennis seems to present.
