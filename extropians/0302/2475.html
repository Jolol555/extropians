<p><p>The concept of the urban village has been around for a decade or so. In
<br>
the mid 90's there was a push in Seattle to build its development plans
<br>
around the concept to reduce traffic and the need for mass transit.
<br>
<p>Until the 1930's, much of the world worked this way. It was only when
<br>
highways were invented that there came great amounts of separation
<br>
between one's residence and place of employment.
<br>
<p>What I have failed to see here is anybody saying that there just isn't
<br>
a real need for planned communities like this for much longer. With the
<br>
internet, people should be able to live wherever they want and obtain
<br>
whatever products, jobs, services etc they wish online.
<br>
<p>The internet as a medium of commerce is the greatest tool for reducing
<br>
pollution the world has ever seen.
