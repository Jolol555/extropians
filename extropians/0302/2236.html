<p><p><em>&gt; What I find strange is that many people would generally agree with the above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paragraph, but then continue to think that preservation of this illusionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;self&quot; is an all-important goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This question bothers me. As a carbon based biped running wetware 
<br>
V1972-.07.02.03 which is of course a self aware and self updating Operating 
<br>
system. My primary function is the survival of said OS and the rather fragile 
<br>
system it runs on.
<br>
A question that has received considerable run time on the OS is whether the 
<br>
primary function is a subroutine that is constantly running. Or does it just 
<br>
monitor all input and hit the alarm button when a threat is perceived? This 
<br>
being a chemical release that tells me 'Death=Bad!'
<br>
<p>Does the rule for the primary function reside in OS itself? That is the 
<br>
'conscious mind' or self. Having been programmed in by years of input and 
<br>
calculation, Or does it reside in the hardware as an input induced chemical 
<br>
release?
<br>
<p>I think the question I am trying to ask is this. Is our fear of death only 
<br>
attributable to the queasy feeling of fear that we get when we either 
<br>
perceive a threat or when we think about one? Or it is driven purely by a 
<br>
learned logical processes that simply tells us death is bad?
<br>
<p>I think that It is mainly a learned thing. I have seen both my children and 
<br>
other peoples children putting themselves in very dangerous positions that 
<br>
could easily kill them. Not only dangers of the modern world such as 
<br>
electricity, but more fundamental dangers like falling down stairs, out of 
<br>
windows or off balconies.
<br>
As a child and even in adolescence I put myself in dangerous positions that 
<br>
in some cases I really was very lucky to survive. It seems that humans are 
<br>
pretty dumb when it comes to danger until they have either learnt through 
<br>
experience or from being taught.
<br>
<p>So when the glorious day come when my OS is copied to a shiny new chrome 
<br>
plated body, will my sense of self preservation also be transferred?  If my 
<br>
OS contains the self preservation code or subroutine, then I will probably 
<br>
exist for a long time, Hardware failures excluded.
<br>
However if the drive for self preservation is purely or mainly down to the 
<br>
chemical feel bad signal that will no longer be felt. I should imagine that 
<br>
my existence would be fairly short.
<br>
<p>Will I just suddenly find myself without the animal inhibitions that make me 
<br>
avoid non existence?
<br>
<p><p>Alex
