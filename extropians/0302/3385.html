</em><br>
<p>Christian,
<br>
&quot;a dose of reality&quot;1:
<br>
Poland and Friends will significantly influence the future common foreign
<br>
policy of Europe. I hope Europe will stay democracy and the votes will
<br>
counts! They are very powerfull friends of America. I can understand motives
<br>
of Chirac rudeness - he lose.
<br>
&quot;a dose of reality&quot; 2:
<br>
Add England, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Netherland, Denmark (others are
<br>
neutral). &quot;Just what significance has the position&quot; of France, Germany? :-)
<br>
Transatlantic community is real.
<br>
&quot;a dose of reality&quot; 3:
<br>
The last reality is the US military.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You might be under the assumption that those countries expressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their true support for the USA because of a common stance against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totalitarianism etc.  Around here, the perception is that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather sucked up to the USA out of political opportunism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It has nothing to do with opportunism. The citizens of thise countrys are
<br>
rather emotionally united with Western values and acknowledge the Center in
<br>
New York, not more in Paris. In Poland, the second position in the
<br>
populiarity take Bush, after Poland's president Kwasniewski (he is,
<br>
differently Shroeder, pro-US). We see America totally others than people of
<br>
Germany, France. Christian, guess why?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As you may know if you follow European politics, there have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ongoing efforts for the last several years to forge a common European
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign policy in order for Europe to be able to speak with a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and correspondingly more powerful voice.  The candidate countries--who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after all have much to gain from EU membership--now seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sabotaging this effort, which is already painful enough as is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That the French, who usually employ much more diplomatic language,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose such direct and forceful expression should be evidence in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself just what an affront this has been.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>..for France.
<br>
France is now the Pocket Imperium. Their politicans live in an virtual world
<br>
of the past. They try to build the new Europeans identity against US; Europe
<br>
as Superpower with France and Germany as leading powers. It is silly. The
<br>
one beast more, that will try to eat others. We shoudn't build European
<br>
Imperium (what for?). We have chance to exercise how to live in peace, maybe
<br>
it will be an example for the world. Building Europe no &quot;against&quot;, above all
<br>
no against US. We should dream unite Europe to unite later the whole world.
<br>
It will be more extropic. OK, it is against Chirac.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The way this mess should have played out instead is that the EU
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sits down, after much painful negotiation comes to a common position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and declaration, and of course it is expected that the countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poised to join the Union share the common values and policy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree with this (or diplomatically shut up).   If you want something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from somebody, you don't start by offending them.
</em><br>
<p><p>Christian! They &quot;offending&quot; maybe France or Germany politics but not Europe.
