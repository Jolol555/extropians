<p>So long as we treat others as our prey and their resources as 
<br>
ours to command, war is here to stay.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Unlike the decision to cooperate
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>We have annouced that we will unilaterally and preemptively 
<br>
attack anything anywhere we consider a threat.  Not exactly 
<br>
cooperation, is it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And so long as the pursuit of predation *is* a unilateral choice
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice between peace and war they have only the practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice between retaining a capacity for war and a willingness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to use it or the choice of accepting the role of prey.
</em><br>
<p>Yet we prohibit others from the capacity for self-defense and 
<br>
propose their invasion if we do not believe the capacity is 
<br>
removed.  The choice is not only between war and destruction. 
<br>
It almost never is.  It certainly is not so when no nation or 
<br>
group  is really at war with you or really capable and likely to 
<br>
do more than an occassional act of terrorism at most.  Under 
<br>
those circumstances to say that we must be at WAR and even give 
<br>
up freedom for it is sheer irresponsible madness and has nothing 
<br>
to do with rationality or with being a free people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Peace is not slavery or acquiescence to the role of prey and it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not come freely or naturally. Peace is a consequence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retaining a capacity for war and of the other knowing that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retain it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>No.  Peace is the result of a deep appreciation for and 
<br>
cultivation of peace wherever possible.  War != Peace.   But the 
<br>
bloodthirsty and the bullies of the world will ever attempt to 
<br>
insist that it does.
