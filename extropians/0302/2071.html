<em> &gt; I was under the impression that anyone who burned large volumes

</em><br>
<em> &gt; that remove particalate matter from the emissions.
</em><br>
<p>They do, at least in most industrial countries. I know for sure that
<br>
they do here in Germany. That doesn't solve the problem, though. This
<br>
toxic waste has to be disposed somewhere, that's right. But there are
<br>
some important differences between waste from coal burning and
<br>
radioactive waste from nuclear power plants.
<br>
<p>(1) We're talking about a fraction of 2-10ppm Uranium and Thorium in
<br>
coal, which is comparable to granite, sandstone and concrete. That means 
<br>
the walls of your house probably contain the same amount of 
<br>
Uranium/Thorium and their decay products like coal.
<br>
<p>(2) Coal ashes (and the dust filtered out of the smoke) is not as 
<br>
dangerous as highly radioactive waste and not of any value for potential 
<br>
bad guys. It can be handled with standard technology without much 
<br>
protective gear, because the natural decay of Uranium to Thorium etc. 
<br>
consists of alpha and beta ray emitting isotopes. This radiation can be 
<br>
shielded with ordinary steal during processing.
<br>
<p>(3) Radioactive waste from nuclear power plants on the other hand 
<br>
contains high concentrations of gamma ray and neutron emitting isotopes. 
<br>
This type of radiation is difficult to shield, highly dangerous for 
<br>
organisms, and neutron radiation embrittles metal and other material. 
<br>
This waste also produces heat for a _very_ long time. That means that 
<br>
even very slow and very improbable chemical reactions between the waste 
<br>
and its containment _will_ happen during the next 10.000 years.  It's 
<br>
like Murphy's law coupled to an Improbability Drive.
<br>
<p>But as I said: burning fossil fuels is also not the right way. In fact,
<br>
no large scale system is, if it produces something we cannot deal with
<br>
in a safe way, i.e. a complete circle of products. Oil/gas/coal produces 
<br>
NOx, CO2, etc. Fission leaves large quantities of highly dangerous 
<br>
waste. And all this energy, even from fusion, finally becomes simple 
<br>
heat that influences the global climate. It's not the single car or the 
<br>
single heater that makes the difference, but the coefficient of n*10^9 
<br>
with n&gt;6 and growing.
