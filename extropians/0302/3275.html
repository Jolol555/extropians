<p>If (US)American politicians only care for (US)American interests, 
<br>
they'll soon see, that the other 5.75 bio. humans have ways to make 
<br>
their interests clear. Be it diplomatic talks, demonstrations - or 
<br>
attempted airplane landings in large buildings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The UN in neither a world goverment nor is it democratic by any means.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you do not like that system then work to create a democratic world 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No, such a democratic world government doesn't exist yet, and perhaps we 
<br>
shouldn't want one, but there are such things as international treaties 
<br>
and one party - by far not the only one, but the most important - that 
<br>
ignores signed treaties is the US government. They broke bilateral 
<br>
treaties (Nicaragua, th US got even convicted for this), presented faked 
<br>
evidence to justify wars (Vietnam, Golf War I, Grenada), support 
<br>
dictators, war lords and even extreme religious fanatics and give a shit 
<br>
for freedom and democracy, whenever they have to choose between what is 
<br>
right and what serves US interests. Saddam Hussein got his Anthrax stems 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;from Mr. Donald Rumsfeld himself.
<br>
<p>It's no wonder we see no progress in non-military solutions of 
<br>
conflicts, when the most important factor for this process doesn't 
<br>
behave in a civilized way. The message to other regimes is clear, 
<br>
especially to those with a likewise &quot;flexible&quot; moral: Might makes right. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the US foreign policy of the last 40 years is one of the 
<br>
major forces _against_ more democracy and freedom.
