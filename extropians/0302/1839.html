<p>Is &quot;insensitive&quot; the same thing as &quot;numb&quot;? I ask because...
<br>
<p>There's a way of training pilots (including some fine ones) that helps me
<br>
at times like these.
<br>
<p>Reviuew and rehearsal of contingencies is done so that the cognitive (and as much
<br>
as possible, the gut) reaction isn't &quot;What the FSCK?!&quot;, but rather &quot;There it goes...&quot;.
<br>
<p>I slept late today. When I read the news (on extro), my first thought was
<br>
&quot;There it goes...&quot;. Not that that makes me special--but I don't think I'll
<br>
be getting a migraine today, the way I did when we lost Challenger. That loss,
<br>
and the subsequent bad behavior of NASA, has provided much insulation.
<br>
<p>Access to space needs to change. I very much doubt NASA has the capability to
<br>
do much about that. The organization has many of the characteristics of high-
<br>
functioning autism, and I ought to know what that looks like. :|
<br>
<p>MMB, going back to operating within my sphere of influence for a while...
<br>
<p>PS: I'm numb at the moment. But I know that under that I could make myself
<br>
*furious* about how little real progress we've made. It's _2003_, for Pete's sake!
<br>
<p>A single vehicle shouldn't make up a double-digit percentage of the fleet--
<br>
we ought to have /airline numbers/ of 'em by now! Hire more Russians, damn it.
<br>
Take *more* chances, cheaper.
