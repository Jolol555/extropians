<em>&gt; Let me not defend the undefensible, but these were the days 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when Mother Russia's Empire was riding high, and it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined to enforce its empire everywhere in the world. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Support for brutal dictatorships did not happen in a vaccum, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but were against the zero-sum game played by the ruling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communist party, in the Soviet Union. 
</em><br>
<p>You're right.  I'm willing to give the US a certain amount of leeway
<br>
for cold war events given the context.  But in the here and now I want
<br>
a US foreign policy that is focused on spreading the qualities that
<br>
make this country great.  I haven't seen that.  We're still propping
<br>
up corrupt dictators.  And when we see a country like Iran actually
<br>
making significant headway towards democracy (it's more democratic
<br>
than many of our so-called allies like Saudi Arabia or Egypt), we
<br>
respond by alienating them and strengthening the hardliners. 
<br>
<p>If a US president stood up and announced that our new foreign policy
<br>
was based around the ideas of spreading democracy and respecting the
<br>
rights of individuals in other countries, I'd applaud it.  What's
<br>
more, such a president would get my support for an invasion of Iraq
<br>
with the intent of putting in place a democratic government that does
<br>
not oppress it's people and is less likely to pursue nuclear weapons.
<br>
The current US administration doesn't meet my bar though.
