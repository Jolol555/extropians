<em> &gt;&gt; Devil's advocate: it's not reliable.  Not all the answers are out there,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Perhaps my young friend Adrian has forgotten how
</em><br>
<em> &gt; information was gathered in the old days.  Our best
</em><br>
<em> &gt; analog to the net was a large building where the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; information was printed on paper.  This information
</em><br>
<em> &gt; was sometimes unreliable, often incomplete and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; nearly always outdated.  Our best analog to google
</em><br>
<em> &gt; was a big wooden cabinet with paper cards that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; might or might not help one find the info one
</em><br>
<em> &gt; needed.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I remember - barely.  But these libraries were also assistants in
<br>
the same way that Google is.  If you did not know the proper way to find
<br>
the information, your chances of finding the information were virtually
<br>
nil even if the library had it.  Google is somewhat of an improvement on
<br>
the former part, and a tremendous improvement on the latter part - but
<br>
it still does not index everything.  (Even everything on the Web: there
<br>
have been times when I was unable to find my own Web site.  Granted,
<br>
it's an *extremely* small Web site that I don't really use for anything,
<br>
but one would think it would at least exist somewhere in Google's
<br>
cache when searching for the title.  The only such reference Google has
<br>
is to a link I posted to the site in a mailing list.)
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Living in the 21st century waaay doesn't suck.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  ^_^
