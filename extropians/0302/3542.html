<p>
Two plans have been presented to the Security Council in 
<br>
&quot;closed-door&quot; consultations. These are &quot;alternative&quot; attempts
<br>
to resolve the current situation between the UN and Iraq.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=6256&amp;Cr=iraq&amp;Cr1=inspect">http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=6256&amp;Cr=iraq&amp;Cr1=inspect</a><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(I provide the above just as background for those interested
<br>
and point out that because the Security Council met &quot;closed-door&quot;
<br>
the two plans are not available for public viewing. 
<br>
<p>However today's editorial in the Australian (sorry link is pay only),
<br>
entitled &quot;UN is out of time on Iraq&quot;, states &quot;The draft asserts
<br>
that Iraq is in breach of at least 10 council resolutions...&quot;. I rang
<br>
the PA of the editor and asked &quot;How is it that this statement is
<br>
able to be made?&quot; and am still awaiting a call back. No breath
<br>
holding here. )
<br>
<p>So, let me be as up-front as befits the circumstances.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, by objective reading, Iraq (under Saddam 
<br>
Hussein) *IS* in material breach of Resolution 1441. 
<br>
<p>However, I am not the Security Council and so I am not
<br>
authorised to make this decision. And neither is any 
<br>
subset of the Council's members voting in an accord of less
<br>
than 9 or in the presence of a permanent member veto. This
<br>
has important ramifications. 
<br>
<p>The Security Council is the UN body charged with the task
<br>
of maintaining effective international peace and security and
<br>
ONCE it becomes &quot;seized of the matter&quot; pertaining to
<br>
such a decision (as is clearly the case with 1441 from which
<br>
the bolded quote derives), it is the ONLY body under the UN
<br>
Charter that has the authority to go to war against a Member
<br>
State by invading that Member State's sovereign territory. 
<br>
<p>I have &quot;heard&quot; phrasing such as &quot;it may be necessary to step
<br>
outside the framework of the UN on this&quot;. This is spin for  
<br>
saying it may be necessary to breach the UN Charter. And
<br>
indeed breaching the UN Charter might be valid but to do this
<br>
without openly acknowledging that it was being done would be
<br>
a very serious matter. All reasonable citizens of open societies
<br>
ought be concerned when Permanent Security Council Members
<br>
breach the Charter as there is no provision to remove them and
<br>
confidence in treaties must necessarily be undermined.
<br>
<p>I have read and heard in the last two days some media and
<br>
political commentary to the effect that it is not necessary for
<br>
a new Security Council resolution to be passed in order for
<br>
a military invasion of Iraq to occur without breaching the UN
<br>
Charter. This is wrong. If the media or if government officials
<br>
have been advised that such is the case then they have been ill
<br>
advised. If Bush or other heads of Member Nations ACT on
<br>
such advice they will be in breach of the UN Charter. 
<br>
<p>But please don't take my word for this: a straight forward reading
<br>
of 1441 (which all 15 members of the Security Council agreed to)
<br>
reveals: --
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(NB. In the following the brackets (), [], and bolding are mine
<br>
and are included for clarity only. The accuracy of excerpting
<br>
can be readily checked by reference to the 5 page text of 1441.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Here again is a link to the US State Dept copy.
<br>
<a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/topical/pol/terror/02110803.htm">http://usinfo.state.gov/topical/pol/terror/02110803.htm</a>. 
<br>
1441 starts below a page of State Dept. commentary.  ).
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>--&quot;The Security Council&quot; (including the US)...
<br>
<p>&quot;Reaffirming the commitment of all Member States (including
<br>
the US) to the sovereign and territorial integrity of Iraq, ..&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Decides&quot;..&quot;to afford Iraq, by [1441], a final opportunity to 
<br>
comply with its disarmament obligations under relevant 
<br>
resolutions of the Council;...&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;...failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and cooperate fully
<br>
in the implementation of, [1441] shall constitute a further material
<br>
breach of Iraq's obligations and will be reported to the Council
<br>
(as a whole) for assessment....&quot;
<br>
<p>----------
<br>
<p>Thus, it is the Security Council that gets to decide the 
<br>
meaning of key terminology in 1441, and specifically, it is the
<br>
Council (and not the US or any group of Members less than
<br>
a quorum) that gets to decide when the &quot;final opportunity&quot; has 
<br>
past. A non-Security Council decision on this point is a usurpation
<br>
of the Security Council's authority and an undermining of the
<br>
UN Charter (unless my reasoning which I have spelt out here for
<br>
anyone to see is wrong). 
<br>
<p>The US ceded any authority it otherwise had to decide on the 
<br>
meaning of key terminology when it placed the matter in the hands
<br>
of the Security Council and signed 1441 which includes the 
<br>
quotations above.
<br>
<p>The US does not merely have a slight preference for getting Security
<br>
Council endorsement before invading Iraq it NEEDS it to avoid
<br>
breaching it's own obligations under the UN Charter. As I have 
<br>
mentioned elsewhere, breaching the Charter can be justified under
<br>
some circumstances, but it is not a trivial thing to be done 
<br>
lightly, as, once it is done, all things that derive their legitimacy from
<br>
the UN Charter being an agreement between Member States that
<br>
will honour their obligations cease to have credible foundation.  
<br>
<p>As I understand it, any Permanent Security Council member
<br>
can veto a resolution including a resolution that deems or implies
<br>
that the &quot;final opportunity&quot; described and committed to by the
<br>
Security Council under 1441 has past. Such passage is itself
<br>
a matter for the Council. 
<br>
<p>This makes the recent statement that any French veto of
<br>
the new resolution would be &quot;an unfriendly act&quot; - harsh words
<br>
in diplomatic circles - informative. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
France's Permanent Member veto cannot be gotten around without 
<br>
breaching the UN Charter. And such a breach is no trifle.
<br>
<p>Hence my conviction that Bush should go direct to Chirac
<br>
in the interests of resolving matters in an optimal way for the
<br>
UN and for the US as well.
