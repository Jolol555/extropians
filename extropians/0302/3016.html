<p>Greg, I think it is generally accepted that one can listen to speech
<br>
at a rate about 3x what one can speak it at.  There was at one time
<br>
a tape recorder that would record at 1x, then cut out 2/3 of the
<br>
recording and play it back at 3x (you have to do this because simply
<br>
playing it back at 3x results in a rise in pitch that makes it very
<br>
difficult to understand the voices).  Surprisingly this approach
<br>
actually worked allowing one to listen at 3x normal speaking speed.
<br>
I suspect your friend may have developed a similar or even better
<br>
ability to listen at higher than normal rate speaking speeds.
<br>
<p>Robert
