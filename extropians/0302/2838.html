<em>&gt; Saddam is the only leader in the world who wants weapons of mass

</em><br>
<p>Wait a second... the US has weapons of mass destruction (and seems to want
<br>
them), has invaded its neighbours, is fairly experienced at trying to
<br>
control the world's supply of oil, and has used chemical weapons on at least
<br>
its own troops and certainly on the citizens of other countries (think
<br>
Vietnam). I'm sure other countries would fit that bill, too. North Korea
<br>
would probably fit rather well if it had oil, which is morally equivalent
<br>
unless you propose that having power over some of the world's oil is somehow
<br>
morally damning.
<br>
<p>Weapons of mass destruction are controlled by numerous world governments who
<br>
seem all too willing to threaten with them, even when they are proposing
<br>
suicide - eg: Pakistan and India. There is only one country that has
<br>
actually used them offensively, and it's not Iraq. The only difference
<br>
between Iraq and other countries wrt to WMD is that Iraq lost a war and so
<br>
pledged not to have these weapons, and Iraq is possibly the country in world
<br>
least likely to actually have WMD, given the lack of inspection of any
<br>
country barring Iraq.
<br>
<p>The thing that scares me about the proposed war is its utter baselessness.
<br>
That our leaders must scrape for ridiculous excuses to engage in war is
<br>
preposterous; that their real motives are indiscernable is worse. IMHO, I'm
<br>
not alone in this; we've had wars before without the incredible protest
<br>
turnouts that we've been getting in the last few days (and the war hasn't
<br>
even started yet). 
<br>
<p>A really interesting thing about the protests is that everyone has been
<br>
suprised by the numbers, politicians and organisers alike. I don't think the
<br>
protest organisers can take credit for the turnouts; the simple fact seems
<br>
to be that people are generally against this war, strongly enough that the
<br>
mums and dads and grannies are coming out of the suburbs and walking the
<br>
streets to make their voices heard. These are people that ordinarily
<br>
wouldn't demonstrate, even for causes they support. The numbers are simply
<br>
too high to be reflecting rent-a-crowd protestors.
<br>
<p>This waging war by governments, against the wishes of just about anyone you
<br>
ask, is the kind of thing that the resident libertarians usually scream blue
<br>
murder about. Where are you?
