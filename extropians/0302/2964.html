<em>&gt; &gt; If there are other civilizations in the visible

<em>&gt; &gt; universe, then they'll have their own wave front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expanding at the speed of light, and yes, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will be a collision.  But there will be no advance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; notice of the meeting.  Moreover, the wave front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; itself will be at the stage of technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; development that characterized the beginning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stages of expansion, not the stage meanwhile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reached at the centers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;So the collision will be on approximately equal terms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are several assumptions [variables] inherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in your model which can turn out very differently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Colonizing new land does not expand uniformly in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all directions.
</em><br>
<p>For the reasons you give below, you may have a good
<br>
point here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It generally follows the path of least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resistance to the greatest riches in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shortest time frame.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I have been supposing that the nano-
<br>
technological flowering consumes all matter
<br>
within reach.  And, whereas Feynman had 
<br>
said, &quot;There is plenty of room at the bottom&quot;,
<br>
nanotech probably is on the bottom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see no good reason to assume that the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced technology will be found near the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; center of the expansion sphere.  Did all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modern technology arise out of Africa or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did a great deal of it happen in the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States while it was still being settled?
</em><br>
<p>I appreciate your historical examples without
<br>
quite admiring them.  No limit to technological
<br>
ascent has been foreseen all the way up to pure
<br>
computronium, matter reduced to its most complex
<br>
state able to compute.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Given nanotech, how is stealth possible?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your nanotech will be fighting, evading,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hiding from other nanotech [both your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own, competing groups within your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expansion sphere, and alien] much like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ants battling for supremacy.  Nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have to remain stealth or be destroyed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corrupted or obsolete nanotech will have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be hunted by other nanotech or its presence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will betray you militarily.  If you cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control your nanotech it becomes a liability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stealth is not about remaining invisible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under all circumstances, it is about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimizing your exposure and making the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemy expend great resources if he wishes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to find you.  His expenditure of great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources exposes him.
</em><br>
<p>That is all true.  And even if supremacy is
<br>
reached---much as Western civilization is
<br>
obtaining supremacy on Earth (the other
<br>
civilizations convert or die), then your
<br>
remarks apply well to VR (virtual reality),
<br>
in which programs fight as you have described.
<br>
<p>However, all this is besides the point of 
<br>
there being *currently* within 10^4 light
<br>
years any technology that would not be
<br>
bearing down on us at the speed of light,
<br>
rapacious for every bit of matter and
<br>
energy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why wouldn't my local civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expand to use every single last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; asteroid in the neighborhood?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Certainly, no solar system will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; escape notice.  The growth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the singularity will be geometric,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; both locally and globally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even bacteria only expand geometrically under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideal circumstances and only for a finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of time due to finite resources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Introduce a single pathogen and all bets are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off.
</em><br>
<p>Bacteria is on the other side of the Von Neumann
<br>
complexity barrier: bacteria cannot live except
<br>
in special, customized environments.  Humans will
<br>
soon be vastly more adaptable than they, and the
<br>
AIs that replace us will control matter supremely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Introduce multiple pathogens or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitors and you develop an ecology.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With an endless Cold War of WoMD in space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will be more concerned about avoiding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction than mining every last piece
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of usable rock.  There is plenty of good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rock to graze on as you live the nomadic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life.  A missing rock here or there will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not raise red alerts like whole asteroids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mined and built into thousand mile long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space stations.
</em><br>
<p>But you speak of this concern &quot;we will be
<br>
more concerned about avoiding destruction...&quot;
<br>
as if it were a conserved quantity.  Yes,
<br>
until now, it has been.  But when programs
<br>
fully inhabit matter, the war will be among
<br>
algorithms only, and there will be a &quot;Wind
<br>
from Earth&quot; with more advanced ones constantly
<br>
trying to supplant or incorporate less
<br>
advanced ones.  There will be no room for
<br>
truly antiquated life to hide in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Think militarily, I'm sure others have and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will.
</em><br>
<p>Correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see interlacing civilizations of nomads,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not colliding brick walls.  Sort of like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different species of bees forming dispersed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swarms.  One swarm can pass right through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another without conflict.
</em><br>
<p>At some early stages of the Von Neumann probe
<br>
dispersal, this seems right.  But then as one
<br>
civilization begins using all available matter
<br>
ruthlessly grasping for every cycle of compute
<br>
power, this passes, I'd say.
