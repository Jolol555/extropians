<p>The telomerase extension activity is more complicated one would expect
<br>
on simple examination.  The telomere lengthening process requires both
<br>
the activity of an RNA-gene (i.e. the production of a segment of RNA
<br>
which allows the lengthening of the repeated DNA component of telomeres)
<br>
as well as the telomerase enzyme (a normal gene converted into a protein
<br>
that operates in conjuction with the RNA based component to extend the
<br>
length of telomeres.)
<br>
<p>While I'm too lazy right now to go determine precisely which chromosomes
<br>
these genes reside on, I am certain that they are well studied by both
<br>
Geron and Sierra Sciences.
<br>
<p>One needs to be aware that telomere shortening is most likely to
<br>
be an anti-cancer program.  Arbitrary lengthening of telomeres
<br>
is not likely to significantly increase longevity -- but will
<br>
most probably increase cancer rates.  Telomere lengthening might
<br>
buy a decade or two for people whose lives are constrained by
<br>
telomere shortening (i.e. those who start out with short telomeres
<br>
and/or have low telomere extension activity) -- but it will not
<br>
ultimately be a &quot;fountain of youth&quot;.  Aging is much more complex than that.
<br>
<p>People who want to push on this vector should support Sierra Sciences
<br>
since that is the general thrust of their research.
