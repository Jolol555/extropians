<p>
And let's not forget the potentional of this drug for treating
<br>
addictions. 
<br>
<p>NEWS:
<br>
Parkinson's Drug May Help Smokers Quit
<br>
<p>Fri Jan 24, 5:37 PM ET 
<br>
<p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A drug used to treat Parkinson's disease
<br>
may help some people quit smoking, the results of a small, preliminary
<br>
study suggest. 
<br>
<p>The drug, selegiline, acts by delaying the breakdown of dopamine, the
<br>
chemical that progressively diminishes in parts of the brain as
<br>
Parkinson's disease advances. 
<br>
<p>&quot;There is increasing evidence for a role of dopamine systems in the
<br>
neurobiology of nicotine dependence,&quot; Dr. Tony P. George and colleagues
<br>
write in the January issue of the journal Biological Psychology. 
<br>
In the study, George's team evaluated the number of patients who quit
<br>
smoking while taking selegiline and assessed any adverse side effects of
<br>
the drug. 
<br>
<p>For eight weeks, 20 patients took selegiline and 20 took an inactive
<br>
placebo. At the end of the eight-week period, 9 of the 20, or 45%, who
<br>
took selegiline had quit smoking. Six months later, four people were
<br>
cigarette-free, the study indicates. 
<br>
<p>By comparison, only 15% of those taking a placebo had stopped smoking by
<br>
the end of eight weeks. Only one person was cigarette-free at six
<br>
months, the authors report. 
<br>
<p>Among those taking selegiline, side effects were &quot;generally mild&quot; and
<br>
included loss of appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms and insomnia, the
<br>
authors report. 
<br>
<p>Given the very small number of people in the study, the authors
<br>
recommend that further studies be conducted to see if selegiline can
<br>
indeed help people quit smoking. 
<br>
<p>&quot;While there are several effective treatments for smoking cessation,
<br>
including nicotine replacement therapies and bupropion (Zyban), there
<br>
are many smokers who do not respond to these drugs,&quot; said George, who is
<br>
with the Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut,
<br>
in a prepared statement. 
<br>
<p>&quot;So developing new drugs for smoking cessation is an important
<br>
undertaking. Selegiline (Deprenyl) appears to be a drug that might have
<br>
promise for treatment of nicotine addiction,&quot; George concluded. 
<br>
The study was funded by grants from the National Institute on Drug
<br>
Abuse, the National Cancer Institute (news - web sites) and the Robert
<br>
Wood Johnson Foundation.
