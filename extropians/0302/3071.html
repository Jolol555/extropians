</em><br>
<p>or even
<br>
<p>Iran, 1953: When the government of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh 
<br>
nationalized the Anglo-Iranian oil company, the resulting sanctions on 
<br>
the country – led by Great Britain and the United States – resulted in 
<br>
economic hardship and political unrest. Fearing that such instability 
<br>
could result in a communist takeover and concerned about the precedent 
<br>
of nationalization on American oil companies elsewhere in the Middle 
<br>
East, agents of the Central Intelligence Agency organized a military 
<br>
coup in 1953, ousting the elected prime minister. The United States 
<br>
returned the exiled Shah to Iran, where he ruled with an iron fist for 
<br>
more than a quarter century. Tens of thousands of dissidents were 
<br>
tortured and murdered by his dreaded SAVAK secret police, organized and 
<br>
trained by the United States. The repression was largely successful in 
<br>
wiping out the democratic opposition. The SAVAK was less successful in 
<br>
infiltrating religious institutions, however, so when the revolution 
<br>
finally took place, toppling the Shah in 1979, the formerly secular Iran 
<br>
came under the leadership of virulently reactionary and anti-American 
<br>
Islamists. The result of the Islamic revolution was not only the end of 
<br>
one of America’s strongest economic and strategic relationships in the 
<br>
Middle East, but also the hostage crisis of 1979-81, Iranian support for 
<br>
anti-American terrorist groups, and a series of armed engagements in the 
<br>
Persian Gulf during the 1980s. Had the United States not overthrown 
<br>
Iran’s constitutional government in 1953 and replaced it with the 
<br>
dictatorial Shah, there would not have been the Islamic Revolution and 
<br>
its bloody aftermath.
