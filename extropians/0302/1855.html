I watched one of the NASA controllers say something today that is typical 
<br>
of holding on to old technology too long.  He said that they did not bother 
<br>
to check for tile damage in orbit because there is nothing they can do 
<br>
about it if there is any damage.  This was true 20 years ago when they 
<br>
designed the shuttle program, but now we have a space station, and vastly 
<br>
advanced computer and robotic technology.  True, no one would be happy 
<br>
about a shuttle stuck at the station while the procedures to fix it in 
<br>
space were developed (perhaps as long as a year or two), but it still beats 
<br>
total loss of the orbiter and the lives of the crew.
<br>
<p>Old technology needs to be thrown out from time to time because it always 
<br>
has the assumptions of the past frozen into its very fabric.  Today we 
<br>
could design small robots who have the job of going out and inspecting the 
<br>
space craft while in orbit, and fixing a class of problems that could not 
<br>
have been fixed 20 years ago.  Today there is no good reason to send the 
<br>
payload and crew in  the same ship.  Computers can fly the current (old) 
<br>
design just fine without the human crew, and a new smaller and safer space 
<br>
craft could be designed to carry the humans for linkup in orbit.
<br>
<p>Many other possibilities exist; it is time for new thinking.
<br>
