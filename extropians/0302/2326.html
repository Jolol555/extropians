<p>Very well said. 
<br>
<p>It brings up an interesting problem: how do we make sure we get more
<br>
useful stuff on the net so we can find it? In your example somebody had
<br>
written about their car problems - a fairly trivial piece of
<br>
information, but he still took the slight effort to write it down. 
<br>
Similarly for all the wonderfully useful bug reports/&quot;why does this
<br>
happen?&quot; for software. But a lot of knowledge is likely still locked
<br>
into our heads, not because it is intrinsically procedural and silent
<br>
but because nobody bothers to enter it into the web. Maybe the most
<br>
important thing about blogging is that people put more of their minds
<br>
online (see
<br>
<a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/techwrapper.jsp?PID=1051-250&amp;CID=1051-020703D">http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/techwrapper.jsp?PID=1051-250&amp;CID=1051-020703D</a>d9@c<br>
&nbsp;But we still need tools to dig out answers to questions like &quot;Why does
<br>
Konqueror crash when I close a window?&quot; and &quot;Are there any easy ways to
<br>
generate random numbers with an uniform distribution over a simplex?&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Has anyone else begun to get the feeling that, wherever you go, you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there to represent the Net groupmind?  I don't have a wireless wearable so 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I get it from time to time when I help out my friends and colleauges by 
<br>
gathering and combining information gathered across the net. We also do 
<br>
it to some extent in out think tank: by having a couple of well educated 
<br>
people that can &quot;borrow&quot; ideas and knowledge from each other, we can 
<br>
write analysis that none of us could do individually (and with Google as 
<br>
a team member, we also can use the net groupmind). 
<br>
<p>I guess a sufficiently effective system would start to approach
<br>
EarthWeb. Note that this is more of a knowledge pool than real thinking,
<br>
and often the information gained is a bit like k-nearest neighbour
<br>
algorithms: it suggests what worked for the most similar previous cases. 
<br>
An intelligent agent then takes this information and integrates with its
<br>
own planning abilities, checking whether it is relevant and likely, and
<br>
then initiates its own version of the plan. Hopefully reporting the
<br>
result. 
<br>
<p>I'm very much reminded of Sasha's teleological soup paper, where he 
<br>
describes the collective learning abilities of networked robots or cars. 
<br>
This is the same phenomenon: we get slightly smarter when anybody learns 
<br>
(and reports) something.
