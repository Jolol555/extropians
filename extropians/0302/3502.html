Spike,
<br>
<p>I did like your ideas, but please don't forget to send Alcor a check for ten million so they can properly implement your concepts. : )
<br>
<p>Perhaps Saul Kent and Bill Faloon will actually do these things if they ever build the Timeship.  We will see.
<br>
<p>I will post your response to Cryonet.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John  
<br>

<br>
<p>John feel free to cross post this to cryonet.

</em><br>
<p>Of course he is, however those who are stuck in
<br>
conventional modes of thought are those who cause
<br>
the most trouble for Alcor.  I had some ideas which
<br>
I think can help everyone to win.  Please read on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Alcor is much too expensive and time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intensive to be a cold storage mausoleum.
</em><br>
<p>Alcor should look into becoming exactly that:
<br>
a mausoleum.  Let it get whatever legal status
<br>
a mausoleum has.  Let it sell itself as just
<br>
a mausoleum.  {They might already do this.}
<br>
That the bodies are frozen is immaterial to the
<br>
fact that these are hallowed grounds, with human
<br>
remains present, etc.  Let Alcor get the same
<br>
superstitious benefits that any cemetery enjoys.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Meanwhile, no one with close ties to Williams was allowed access to the lab 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Williams' body hung suspended in a giant cylinder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hamon couldn't accept that.
</em><br>
<p>OK, this seems like an easy one to solve, without
<br>
running up the cost too high.
<br>
<p>Make dewars that have the right dimensions
<br>
to allow the patients to lie horizontal, just
<br>
like they would in any cemetery.  I can't
<br>
imagine this would be all that technically
<br>
difficult.  Get plaques that say Here *lies*
<br>
the Splendid Splinter, etc.  Allow the same
<br>
access as an ordinary mausoleum would allow.
<br>
<p>Let us deal with superstition the way a
<br>
surfer deals with waves: dont fight it, ride it.
<br>
<p>Seems to me you could even place the corpsicles
<br>
in &quot;coffins&quot; of sorts, smaller than the traditional
<br>
ones, custom fit so as to not use up a lot of room
<br>
in the dewar.  Then if the proles get jiggy about
<br>
several bodies sharing the same dewar, one could
<br>
argue, no, each has its own coffin.  They share the
<br>
same liquid nitrogen in the same sense that everyone
<br>
in the cemetery shares the same soil.
<br>
<p>If it makes people feel better, we could even place
<br>
the dewar underground, so the families could imagine
<br>
their ancestors are buried.
<br>
<p>Please indulge me in one more comment on upside-ism.
<br>
As one who has talked to a number of innocents
<br>
about cryonics, I can assure you that these minor
<br>
points do matter.  Those of you who are trained in
<br>
christian lore, recall that when the Apostle Peter
<br>
was to be crucified, he asked to suffer the ignominious
<br>
fate of being hung upside down.  This practice was
<br>
intended to heap further shame upon the prisoner
<br>
in his final hours, but Peter requested this because he
<br>
felt he was unworthy of the honor of being crucified in
<br>
the same manner as Hoerkheimer Christ.
<br>
<p>Be that as it may, Alcor really needs to rethink
<br>
the upside down posture, even if it makes sense
<br>
from a technical point of view.  And failing the
<br>
coffins in the dewar bit, perhaps us a body bag, so
<br>
as to satisfiy the squicked yahoos that think that
<br>
it matters.  {Again, they might already be doing
<br>
this or something equivalent, but it did not come
<br>
out in the hysterical news article.}
<br>
<p>It is in the best interest of all of us to protect
<br>
Alcor and its sister organizations from these kinds
<br>
of criticisms raised by uninformed or misinformed
<br>
proles, for we all know we have an inexhaustable
<br>
supply of these kinds of people, and plenty of lawyers
<br>
with nothing to do and plenty of news organizations
<br>
eager to print all the news thats fit to sell papers.
