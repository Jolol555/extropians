<em>&gt; &gt; Well, I contend that &quot;marching&quot; to make your point

<em>&gt; &gt; democratic country.  The only thing more stupid (yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exactly equally non-cooperative) is &quot;general strike&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So say you're in democratic nation A with a general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom of speech expression, good civil rights, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally wholesome nation.
</em><br>
<p>Cory then gives examples of terrible things that
<br>
should outrage me and most others in our nation,
<br>
but
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The government is an inobtrusive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bureaucracy-choked morass
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Yourself and a significant portion of the population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are outraged that this is going on in a supposed free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country, and want to let it be known that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intolerable.  How do you effectively strike out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against this?
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many people agree with you on this, but a rising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious undertone is showing blind support to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government which is spreading (effectively) propaganda,
</em><br>
<p>etc.
<br>
<p>The biggest questions that such problems pose for me is
<br>
&quot;why am I better informed than my neighbors&quot;, and &quot;how
<br>
do I account for judging my information and knowledge
<br>
to be superior to theirs?&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, in certain contrived hypothetical situations, I
<br>
really do have objectively better information, and
<br>
would act on it.  If I alone were talking to aliens
<br>
on a regular basis, and had a good explanation as to
<br>
why I was the *chosen* one, then there are all sorts
<br>
of things that I might do as a publicity stunt to get
<br>
my views well known.  I might chain myself to the
<br>
front gate of the White House, as Bobby Fischer's
<br>
mother is said to have done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now of course protests in reality often fall far short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any reasonable claims (animal rights activists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; storming Wendy's), but you claim it's about as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncooperative a thing as you can do in a democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country.  If this is universally true, then how would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you respond in this situation?
</em><br>
<p>If I don't, on the other hand, have any special knowledge,
<br>
then all I would do is vent my indignation by joining
<br>
action committees, writing letters to newspapers and
<br>
magazines, attending local neighborhood meetings, and
<br>
virtually anything that still fell within Kant's
<br>
Imperative.  (This, of course, is what I would also
<br>
prefer that everyone else do.)  I would feel this way
<br>
and restrain myself accordingly no matter how strongly
<br>
I felt about something.
<br>
<p>It is extremely easy for people to suppose either that
<br>
they have special knowledge, or that they have superior
<br>
morality.  In their own minds this justifies anything,
<br>
often up to and including violence.  You can easily
<br>
imagine the chaos if we all took to the streets, or
<br>
barricaded the entrances to buildings, or simply lay
<br>
down in the driveways of the homes of those we felt
<br>
were on the wrong side of some issue.
<br>
<p>If you do disturb traffic, or &quot;march&quot; in support of
<br>
various causes, how do you explain to yourself that
<br>
it's all right for you to do this, but it wouldn't
<br>
be all right if everyone did it?
<br>
<p>Lee
