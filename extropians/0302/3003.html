<p>
Again, I hope this heads-up isn't regarded as spam. Apologies if so.
<br>
<p>Those industrious folks at Fictionwise have today e-released my novel
<br>
STRIPED HOLES, which won an Aussie best of the year award a while back. I
<br>
kinda like it. Here's their blurb, which captures the thing well enough:
<br>
<p>=======
<br>
<p>Science fiction that makes you grin, and then laugh out loud, is hard to
<br>
find. With this very funny short novel, Damien Broderick joined the ranks of
<br>
Robert Sheckley, Bob Shaw, John Sladek, Arthur Schopenhauer and Douglas
<br>
Adams (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). Sopwith Hammil is a popular but
<br>
rather stupid TV presenter when a time machine lands in his living room. To
<br>
save his life and the human race (they're turning the Sun off!), he must
<br>
find a wife inside three hours. Meanwhile, 197 years later, in a world that
<br>
makes 1984 look like Brave New World, beautiful Hsia Shan-Yun is fighting
<br>
the future--and losing. Meanwhile, on Alpha Grommett, two married robots
<br>
find their love-life has become depressingly mechanical. Meanwhile, the
<br>
wacky astrologer O'Flaherty Gribble has discovered the long-lost secret of
<br>
the Callisto Effect. Meanwhile, in a pact with the devil--
<br>
<p>=======
