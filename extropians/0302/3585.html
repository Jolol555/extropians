<p><em>&gt; Amara [wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Apparently, I'm not 'getting the message' that many of you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; getting, because I find myself more and more frustrated and sad to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see people's obsession with fearful thoughts.  This is *your life*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you really want to spend it this way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I won't change my life for the latest government / media report of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the scare-of-the-week, because it looks like more  Paranoia-Ville.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and I refuse to buy into that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't express how strongly I agree with this. Like Amara I am both amazed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and disturbed by the obsession so many people have with an unattainable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideal of &quot;safety&quot;, to the point that they are prepared to sacrifice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything else to it.
</em><br>
<p>I am frankly bewildered by this.  Am I not watching enough television
<br>
or something?  The people at work and on this list seem rather normal,
<br>
and I'm not hearing of untoward incidents in the Bay Area (that is,
<br>
California).  I did hear one report of a guy back east who wrapped
<br>
his entire house in plastic, but I thought that this was an aberration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [The] powerful feed and stimulate panic and paranoia. They at least have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ascribable motives but why has this mania got such a hold on the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public, particularly (I have to say) in Anglo-Saxon countries?
</em><br>
<p>What mania is this?  People seem about as unconcerned as all during
<br>
the sixties when the chances of personal injury (due to atomic war)
<br>
were actually much greater.  Yes, starting in the eighties, there
<br>
was a certain amount of &quot;panic&quot;, but mostly in intellectual circles,
<br>
about the nuclear overkill, nuclear winter, and so on, and that has
<br>
indeed been replaced by worries about global warming, genetically
<br>
modified foods, alien abductions and so on; but the people who I
<br>
know that are worried about the latter seem to be affected in only
<br>
a superficial matter---almost as though some part of them regarded
<br>
it merely as entertainment.  In short, they didn't exhibit real
<br>
symptoms of worry and anxiety.
<br>
<p>Spike had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some months ago I speculated similarly, that a terrorist could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily obtain some type of legal and harmless radioactive material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as Americium from smoke detectors, power it, spread it using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordinary commercially available fireworks, then watch the proles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; panic.[...]
</em><br>
<p>but not in any noticeable tone of anxiety or panic, and I'm certain
<br>
he's as cheery as ever.  So his message can't really be the source
<br>
of the sadness and frustration Amara reported in
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find myself more and more frustrated and sad to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see people's obsession with fearful thoughts. 
</em><br>
<p>If I were to speculate, I might wonder if some of us are more sensitive
<br>
than others, and if that were somehow at the base of it.  But I'm quite
<br>
willing to entertain any kind of explanation, so bemused am I.
<br>
<p>I haven't noticed whatever it is Amara and Steve are talking about,
<br>
unless we've got a communication problem/misunderstanding at work.
<br>
