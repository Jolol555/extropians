<em>&gt; If WMD are ever used by Saddam or any other terrorist organization

<em>&gt; against America I expect they will be shipped just like any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; package, by UPS or Federal Express.
</em><br>
<p>And why should he be so stupid? If any piece of such an attack could be 
<br>
traced back into Iraq, Saddam and his regime would be bombed to pieces by 
<br>
an international coalition, not by one country alone. To actively attack 
<br>
something or someone outside his own country would be suicide for Saddam 
<br>
and I'm sure he knows that so pretty well, that nowadays, he wouldn't let 
<br>
any terrorist come near him.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;I don't think that Iraq is telling the tuth, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then I guess you don't think the United Nations should play any part in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future world events.
</em><br>
<p>This decision has been made by others, not by me. Several states continue 
<br>
to ignore UN resolutions, simply because they know that noone is coming 
<br>
to punish them. Not only Iraq, but Israel, China (AFAIK) and last but not 
<br>
least the US government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The UN unanimously passed a resolution requiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq to tell the TRUTH about its weapons and disarm; if UN resolutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are nothing but hot air then the UN is toast.
</em><br>
<p>So, in your opinion, the punishment for lying is total destruction and 
<br>
death not only for the liar, but also for those he holds hostage? There's 
<br>
nothing else we can do? Hm. For someone with only a hammer, everything 
<br>
looks like a nail, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; I say send more inspection teams, do more surveillance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only reason Saddam let inspectors back in is that the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surrounded his country with 200,000 soldiers, that can not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintained indefinably and the nanosecond that pressure is reduced he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will kick the inspectors out just as he did before.
</em><br>
<p>(1) It doesn't take 200,000 soldiers to maintain the pressure.
<br>
(2) The best part of the world would be glad to help, if this 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were not the private adventure game of Mr. Bush and his friends.
<br>
(3) The USA military bases in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Turkey were
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;able to ensure the no flight zones for twelve years now. How much
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more would it take to extend this zone across the whole country
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have daily practice with AWACS, U2 and other systems?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         &gt;force Iraq to accept human rights, free press,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt;free political activities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Force? How?
</em><br>
<p>Read my mail again: &quot;But _not_ by a massive attack and military 
<br>
invasion, but by one step after another, full publicity and no chance for 
<br>
arab extremists and terrorists to use the Iraq incident for their own 
<br>
business - e.g. get their hands on the leftovers of any WMD fabrication.&quot;
<br>
<p>That means: use _approriate_ tools and force on the actual spot, military 
<br>
if necessary, but don't make it a global mess.
<br>
<p>&quot;If an invasion is necessary, make it a silent invasion of inspection 
<br>
teams, human rights supervisors, international relief organizations, etc. 
<br>
until the Iraq regime can no longer maintain its pressure on the people. 
<br>
If Saddam refuses to comply, use restricted force against the spots he 
<br>
denies access to. Even if this requires years, it will be cheaper and 
<br>
more under control than a war at this time.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    &gt; In other words: Do you have any proof for your claim?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't need any proof for my &quot;claim&quot; because in my last post I only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrote about weapons that Iraq has admitted having or things the UN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspectors (not Washington) have deduced.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, okay. But those weapons have been destroyed, right? In fact, as Mr. 
<br>
Blix said, the UN inspection teams have destroyed more weapons during the 
<br>
last 12 years than the international troops of gulf war 1 did.
<br>
<p>So what are we talking about, the weapons that have been destroyed or the 
<br>
alleged weapons that have not been found yet? Do you have the hard facts 
<br>
that Mr. Powell failed to present? Or is this another turn of &quot;it is 
<br>
there, because I believe it must be there&quot;? And if there are not hard 
<br>
facts yet, why not find them first? Is this going to be a second gulf of 
<br>
Tonkin maneuver?
<br>
