<p>(guess my girlfriend's suggestion of a robot camera with jets was a good guess after all...)
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>One system, the AERCam-SPRINT has already proven its robotic right stuff. It flew on STS-87 in 1997. 
<br>
<p>AERCam -- short for Autonomous Extra-vehicular Robotic Camera -- is a small, hand deployed and captured remote controled inspection tool. It carries its own avionics and nitrogen-gas propulsion. The surface of the ball-shaped robot is covered with cushions to prevent damage in case of collisions with other space hardware. It weighs a little less than 38 pounds (17 kilograms), and is outfitted with two cameras, position lights and a floodlight. The AERCam is designed to fly very slowly - just less than one-quarter of a foot per second.
<br>
<p>During an STS-87 space walk, astronaut Winston Scott released the oversized soccer ball of a robot. It flew freely within the shuttle's cargo bay for about one-half hour. Meanwhile, shuttle pilot Steve Lindsey from the space plane's aft flight deck using a hand controller, two laptop computers and a window-mounted antenna remotely controlled the free-flyer. 
<br>
<p>External views of shuttle
<br>
<p>David Akin, a leading space robotic expert at the University of Maryland in College Park, said AERCam &quot;demonstrated that free-flying cameras can be easily controlled and provide wonderful external views of the space shuttle.&quot;
<br>
<p>Although its flight was restricted to just above the cargo bay, Akin told SPACE.com , feasibility studies have been done by NASA to fly AERCam underneath the vehicle to image tiles. 
<br>
<p>&quot;There are concerns about loss of signal.but it is possible to use orbital dynamics effects to put the vehicle in a 'free orbit' of the orbiter at a distance of a couple of hundred feet,&quot; Akin said.
<br>
<p>&quot;With some modifications to the orbiter communications systems, or better placement of dedicated antennas, it should be possible to do remotely-controlled close inspections of the tiles,&quot; Akin said.
<br>
<p>AERCam could show other types of external damage too, Akin said.
