<em>&gt; &gt; Is a cloud an &quot;illusion&quot;?  Is something that is constantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shifting for that reason &quot;illusion&quot;?  If so, then what does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; matter?  Matter itself is consistently shifting at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fundamental level.
</em><br>
<p>Our forthcoming control of our neural patterning will mean that
<br>
we can choose to keep memories or thought types subject only
<br>
to the limits of our storage capabilities and control capabilities.
<br>
These would seem to be under current understanding about
<br>
200 million times the current level, more if augmentation is
<br>
greater or biological componentry is replaced. Currently our
<br>
neurons and their firing pattern do change and some die, but
<br>
generically they do not regrow, nor disappear when we sleep, so
<br>
continuity is a principle. Change, then, is interlinked with
<br>
continuity currently (there are principles at work, directions).
<br>
In the future we will be able to choose these. Those who adopt
<br>
stasis scenarios are making a valid choice, although whether this
<br>
can be adhered to over scales of over 10-100 billion years is yet to be
<br>
determined (even with external memory sources).
<br>
<p>The self is informed by the actions of others. We know this from
<br>
studies of animals raised without contact. The self exists neurologically,
<br>
which we know from the effects of brain defects.
<br>
<p>Fused twins who brains are partially fused still do not share much even
<br>
at the motor-sensory level, from my readings. Therefore the sense of self
<br>
is linked to the map of the brain as it stands. To interlink the sense of
<br>
self with another individual will require specially designed interfacing and
<br>
rewiring of the brain. Interlinking of the senses is another matter.
<br>
However,
<br>
our sense of self is lodged somewhere in the architecture of our brains, and
<br>
in a lesser sense in some other species. Possibly it is a combination of
<br>
generic facillities, some form of &quot;opening&quot; between compartments of the
<br>
brain and specialized centres.
<br>
<p>Personally emotionally I see the self as informed by the actions of others,
<br>
surrounded by an egoshield with a subconscious and superconscious
<br>
(altruistic level).
<br>
<p>Brain design indicates different levels of evolutionary development present
<br>
in the brain. In this sense, an additional &quot;layer&quot; could be nanofilaments of
<br>
computronium and also molecular supercomputers/cell repair machines inside
<br>
each neuron/dendrite.
<br>
<p>Pesonally I see continuous broadcast linkage as an option, but uploading as
<br>
a great fallacy equal to that of belief in a soul. Tipler's quantum
<br>
splitting is
<br>
understandable to me but there seems to be no evidence of a soul. I would
<br>
of course create a soul if that were possible. But in the absence of it or
<br>
proof of Tipler I would never upload. Atomic level near-duplicates of me
<br>
would have to mourn the permanent death of their near-twin or parent.
<br>
Uploading is merely childbirth with your parent's memories attached. In this
<br>
sense it would be unethical to create a new being without seeking consent to
<br>
insert memories of the parent. Similarly, if reinacarnation were possible it
<br>
would
<br>
be unethical to insert memories into the developing fetus.
<br>
<p>This is something I haven't fully appreciated before. New beings, whether
<br>
human
<br>
or silicon-based or whatever, deserve to have the capacity to self-boost and
<br>
free
<br>
will present, at least upon reaching maturation within fairly defined
<br>
limits, and also
<br>
deserve to have the option of accepting or rejecting memories. The issue of
<br>
&quot;instincts&quot;
<br>
is there of course, and in the world of designer brains this is a debate
<br>
(see Greg Egan).
<br>
Nonetheless the rights of the child do seem to argue against many versions
<br>
of uploading
<br>
in fiction.
