</em><br>
<p>I see your point, but then again I also think its an easy mistake to make 
<br>
to assume that a dictator has an accurate perception of reality.  When you 
<br>
have the ability to execute anyone who says what you don't want to hear, 
<br>
people tend to tell you what you want to hear, and that in turn tends to 
<br>
make you delusional.  Saddam has already misjudged his position once, when 
<br>
he invaded Kuwait, and most of the dictators we read about in the history 
<br>
books are prone to do very stupid things - like the invasions of Russia or 
<br>
trusting Hitler to keep his word or the Great Leap Forward.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;     &gt;I don't think that Iraq is telling the tuth, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then I guess you don't think the United Nations should play any part in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; future world events.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This decision has been made by others, not by me. Several states continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to ignore UN resolutions, simply because they know that noone is coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to punish them. Not only Iraq, but Israel, China (AFAIK) and last but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least the US government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The UN unanimously passed a resolution requiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Iraq to tell the TRUTH about its weapons and disarm; if UN resolutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are nothing but hot air then the UN is toast.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So, in your opinion, the punishment for lying is total destruction and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;death not only for the liar, but also for those he holds hostage? There's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing else we can do? Hm. For someone with only a hammer, everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looks like a nail, right?
</em><br>
<p>I think the idea being put forward is more:  &quot;If you try to conquer a 
<br>
country we'll conquer you, unless you do these things so that we'll trust 
<br>
you again.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;     &gt; I say send more inspection teams, do more surveillance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The only reason Saddam let inspectors back in is that the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; surrounded his country with 200,000 soldiers, that can not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maintained indefinably and the nanosecond that pressure is reduced he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will kick the inspectors out just as he did before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(1) It doesn't take 200,000 soldiers to maintain the pressure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(2) The best part of the world would be glad to help, if this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     were not the private adventure game of Mr. Bush and his friends.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(3) The USA military bases in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Turkey were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     able to ensure the no flight zones for twelve years now. How much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     more would it take to extend this zone across the whole country
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and have daily practice with AWACS, U2 and other systems?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;         &gt;force Iraq to accept human rights, free press,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;         &gt;free political activities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Force? How?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Read my mail again: &quot;But _not_ by a massive attack and military
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invasion, but by one step after another, full publicity and no chance for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arab extremists and terrorists to use the Iraq incident for their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;business - e.g. get their hands on the leftovers of any WMD fabrication.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That means: use _approriate_ tools and force on the actual spot, military
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if necessary, but don't make it a global mess.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;If an invasion is necessary, make it a silent invasion of inspection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teams, human rights supervisors, international relief organizations, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;until the Iraq regime can no longer maintain its pressure on the people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If Saddam refuses to comply, use restricted force against the spots he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;denies access to. Even if this requires years, it will be cheaper and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more under control than a war at this time.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Its nice to see constructive ideas about what could be done with regard to 
<br>
Iraq short of war.  I would bet that if a super intelligence was present it 
<br>
could quickly come up with ideas for resolving the crisis that even normal 
<br>
intelligences like us are capable of understanding.  However, I have to say 
<br>
that I don't think this particular idea would work.
<br>
<p>If we were to invade we would have several advantages over the Iraqis.
<br>
1:  We know where they're forces are.
<br>
2:  They don't know where our forces are.
<br>
3:  We have the initiative.
<br>
4:  We have air power.
<br>
5:  Iraqi troops aren't very competent.
<br>
<p>I fear that if were to only send in troops to support our inspection teams 
<br>
we would lose all of these advantages, except perhaps for 1 and 5.  If 
<br>
Saddam denies the UN access to a site, he knows where the US will have to 
<br>
strike, and he can easily ambush the forces and then withdraw before our 
<br>
plane get there.  Or, he could just remove any incriminating materials from 
<br>
a locations while he denies access, but before our forces arrive.  I won't 
<br>
say this situation would be anywhere near as bad as Vietnam, but it would 
<br>
be similar in that our troops would be dying in a foreign country without 
<br>
appearing to be accomplishing anything, and so I doubt we would be able to 
<br>
sustain these efforts for long.  It might be that I am missing something, 
<br>
and I look forward to what you have to say, but right now I think that it 
<br>
would be better to do nothing than to use the plan you suggest.
<br>
<p><p>Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.  Don't assign 
<br>
to stupidity what might be due to ignorance.  And try not to assume you 
<br>
opponent is the ignorant one-until you can show it isn't you.
