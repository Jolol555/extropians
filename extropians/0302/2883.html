<em>&gt; (Rafal Smigrodzki &lt;<a href="mailto:rafal@smigrodzki.org?Subject=Re:%20Join%20the%20not-knowers,%20%20was%20RE:%20Giant%20anti-war%20demonstration%20in%20Melbourne">rafal@smigrodzki.org</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### And I am another (tending a little bit against the war, but not much). I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand that Lee Crocker, and Greg Burch don't know for sure either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (please forgive me if I am misrepresenting anybody's opinions).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I feel I am in good company here, with the not-knowers.
</em><br>
<p>I'm still in the undecided camp; if my rhetoric lately has been
<br>
somewhat hawkish, it's only because I'm truly embarrassed at the
<br>
pathetic quality of arguments I see from the other side.  There
<br>
probably are some legitimate arguments for not acting right away,
<br>
but all I've heard from the anti-war crowd is the usual pacifist
<br>
drivel that war is wrong, there must be a better way, yada yada.
<br>
I also totally reject any notion that the present government of
<br>
Iraq is legitimate and deserves respect under international law,
<br>
and the notion that action might actually increase the threat of
<br>
terrorism is predicated on the ridiculous notion that those who
<br>
hate us have or need legitimate reasons.
<br>
<p>I am very definitely /not/ a pacifist.  Peace is a side-effect of
<br>
freedom and justice, not something to value in its own right.
<br>
Whether or not forcibly removing Hussein from power now rather
<br>
than waiting for his regime to die off by itself will result in
<br>
more freedom and justice in the world is a debatable issue.
<br>
<p>I'm also concerned that we've left Israel out of the debate.  If
<br>
anyone has a legitimate case for action, it's Israel, who is much
<br>
closer and had scuds tossed at her directly last time around,
<br>
and they have much more experience in setting up a reasonably free
<br>
government in the area.  I'd much rather see the US lending aid to
<br>
an Israeli-led force to remove Hussein.  But maybe that's really
<br>
what we're doing and we're just agreeing to take the heat publicly.
<br>
