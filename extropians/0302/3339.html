<p>Yes, thanks, this possibility has also occurred to me. I've always known
<br>
it is unwise to use the same password at multiple sites, but in practice
<br>
is so much easier to remember only one password that I have succumbed to
<br>
laziness in this respect for casual purposes. In reality I do in fact
<br>
use two passwords, however, one for sensitive information and one for
<br>
&quot;casual&quot; uses such as website logons. So far I have evidence only that
<br>
my casual password has been stolen. My real concern however is that the
<br>
intruder has used keylogging software, in which case my hi-security
<br>
password may also have been stolen. This could potentially be disastrous
<br>
for me if the information fell into the wrong hands. This person seems
<br>
so far interested only in disrupting my personal life. I can only hope
<br>
and wish that this is her (his?) only motivation. My computer is
<br>
integral to my financial life and my professional life, which leaves me
<br>
vulnerable to things much worse. 
<br>
<p>Reason's recommendation (thank you) to save data files and reformat is
<br>
the obvious solution to re-establishing my computer security, and
<br>
obviously I will be doing this very soon, probably within the next 48-72
<br>
hours. However I was and am still hoping that someone here might be an
<br>
expert on the subject of keylogging and anti-keylogging software, so
<br>
that I can determine immediately if in fact my security is being
<br>
compromised in this way. I have no idea if the trial products I have
<br>
downloaded and tried (&quot;Anti-keylogger&quot; by Raytown Corporation and
<br>
&quot;SpyCop&quot;) are worthwhile programs. I do not know how to interpret the
<br>
suspect data returned by Raytown's Anti-keylogger product, which comes
<br>
with almost no documentation. The SpyCop product returned news of
<br>
nothing suspicious, which is great news but only if this is in fact a
<br>
reliable product for detecting keylogging.
<br>
<p>In the meantime I am just being very careful about what I do and type,
<br>
so that any surveillance software that might be present will see nothing
<br>
of interest other than my own attempts to defeat it. 
<br>
<p>Thank you also to Alfio, who sent me some valuable advice offlist.
