<p>
And on a more uplifting note:
<br>
<p>I was reading the Old Testament this afternoon, as one does, and I found a
<br>
clear passage that demonstrates God's enthusiasm for abortion, under the
<br>
right circumstances. Those circumstances are that a woman's husband should
<br>
*suspect* his wife of fucking another man and being pregnant by him, but
<br>
have absolutely no proof. His understandable jealousy, the Good Book tells
<br>
us, is ample warrant for his wife to be aborted by a suitably qualified
<br>
priest equipped with an abortifacient.
<br>
<p>It is a short step from this illuminating text to the plain implication that
<br>
stem cell research using aborted embryos is perfectly kosher, as long as the
<br>
mother is a slut, or suspected of being one.
<br>
<p>Here's the text. Marvel at the wisdom (this is one for Brett to tuck into
<br>
his dillybag):
<br>
<p>=====
<br>
<p>11 The Lord commanded Moses 12 to give the Israelites the following
<br>
instructions. It may happen that a man becomes suspicious that his wife is
<br>
unfaithful to him and has defiled herself by having intercourse with another
<br>
man. But the husband may not be certain, for his wife may have kept it
<br>
secret—there was no witness, and she was not caught in the act. Or it may
<br>
happen that a husband becomes suspicious of his wife, even though she has
<br>
not been unfaithful. 15 In either case the man shall take his wife to the
<br>
priest. He shall also take the required offering of two pounds of barley
<br>
flour, but he shall not pour any olive oil on it or put any incense on it,
<br>
because it is an offering from a suspicious husband, made to bring the truth
<br>
to light. 16 The priest shall bring the woman forward and have her stand in
<br>
front of the altar. 17 He shall pour some holy water into a clay bowl and
<br>
take some of the earth that is on the floor of the Tent of the Lord's
<br>
presence and put it in the water to make it bitter. 18 Then he shall loosen
<br>
the woman's hair and put the offering of flour in her hands. In his hands
<br>
the priest shall hold the bowl containing the bitter water that brings a
<br>
curse. 19 Then the priest shall make the woman agree to this oath spoken by
<br>
the priest: &quot;If you have not committed adultery, you will not be harmed by
<br>
the curse that this water brings. 20 But if you have committed adultery, 21
<br>
may the Lord make your name a curse among your people. May he cause your
<br>
genital organs to shrink and your stomach to swell up. 22 May this water
<br>
enter your stomach and cause it to swell up and your genital organs to
<br>
shrink.&quot;
<br>
<p>The woman shall respond, &quot;I agree; may the Lord do so.&quot; 23 Then the priest
<br>
shall write this curse down and wash the writing off into the bowl of bitter
<br>
water. 24 Before he makes the woman drink the water, which may then cause
<br>
her bitter pain, 25 the priest shall take the offering of flour out of the
<br>
woman's hands, hold it out in dedication to the Lord, and present it on the
<br>
altar. 26 Then he shall take a handful of it as a token offering and burn it
<br>
on the altar. Finally, he shall make the woman drink the water. 27 If she
<br>
has committed adultery, the water will cause bitter pain; her stomach will
<br>
swell up and her genital organs will shrink. Her name will become a curse
<br>
among her people. 28 But if she is innocent, she will not be harmed and will
<br>
be able to bear children. 29 This is the law in cases where a man is jealous
<br>
and becomes suspicious that his wife has committed adultery. The woman shall
<br>
be made to stand in front of the altar, and the priest shall perform this
<br>
ritual. 31 The husband shall be free of guilt, but the woman, if guilty,
<br>
must suffer the consequences.
<br>

<br>
<p>Blessings,
<br>
