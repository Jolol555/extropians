In a message dated 2/20/2003 10:02:22 AM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:mez@apexnano.com?Subject=Re:%20Egypt%20(was:%20Bush%20budget%20has%200%20dollars%20for%20afghanistan)">mez@apexnano.com</a> writes: The US provides $3B in direct aid to egypt.  That's 
<br>
second only to Israel.  It's also around a quarter of the hard currency that 
<br>
flows into egypt each year.  Yet the US applies little or no pressure to open 
<br>
up the press, hold elections, crack down on corruption, or reform the 
<br>
educational system.  
<br>
<p>Mez,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee Corbin suggested to you that you read the book by Hernando de 
<br>
Soto, The Mystery of Capitalism.  I suggest you do so also.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book describes what went on the the US and some other countries 
<br>
that largely resulted in what success we have had.  Some other countries have 
<br>
been successful with the same methods.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to start you down that road, to understanding the US, 
<br>
with this thought -- can you believe we sort of stumbled into our success 
<br>
pattern and even today 98% of our people haven't got the foggiest idea what 
<br>
it was that we did (and are doing) that was right?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will forgive me I would like to second Lee's suggestion but 
<br>
refrain from discussing Dr. de Soto's book any further -- he understands his 
<br>
subject far better than I do so why don't you get it straight from the horses 
<br>
mouth.
<br>
Ron h.
