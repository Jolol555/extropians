<p>You know....I'd really, really LIKE to beleive that....I really would.
<br>
<p>But some days....after putting in about 8 or 10 hours (the most I'll admit 
<br>
too)  under really aggravating conditions (east of the mississippi...in a Big 
<br>
City.....or along a coast (pick a coast...any coast)....the cynical part of 
<br>
me takes over.
<br>
<p>I've come to the conclusion (only quarter serious yet..) that there are two 
<br>
purposes for the road system in the US....
<br>
<p>The secondary purpose  is to transport people and goods.
<br>
<p>The primary purpose is to &quot;filter&quot; the gene pool.  (Kill off stupid 
<br>
people....unfortunately....stupid people take innocent people with them.) 
<br>
&quot;Think of it as evolution in action.&quot;
<br>
<p>It works rather well.  From my experience I'd say there are hardly any non 
<br>
preventable car wrecks.(Fog?...Snow?...Ice?....SLOW DOWN!!!!!!....duh!)... 
<br>
Almost ALL of them are &quot;pilot error&quot;.  
<br>
<p>Ever notice how many times cars run off the road on curves?
<br>
Ever notice how many unnecessary curves there are? (and side road 
<br>
intersections on curves....on BANKED curves)
<br>
Ever notice how GOOFY (nonintuitive..and non standard..what 
<br>
standard?....there IS no standard) so many intersections, interchanges, 
<br>
crossroads.......etc are?
<br>
<p><p>Ever notice sign placement? (or sign height?....dead center in my field of 
<br>
view...truck driver height....cant see around em....good for hiding cars)
<br>
<p>I could &lt;pant, pant&gt; (and have) ranted for hours on this subject.
<br>
<p>I notice all these things......and curse them daily.
<br>
<p><p>But they certainly Kill off inattentive drivers.(and innocent bystanders)
