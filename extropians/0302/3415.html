<br>
into a preemptive war that will destabilize international relations and 
<br>
therefore create more trouble? What is it that cannot wait some more months, 
<br>
some more hundred inspectors, better surveillance, UN human rights 
<br>
supervisors who ensure free press, access to free information and free 
<br>
elections in some years, etc.? 
<br>
<p>Kai,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why a discussion with you is so difficult and in one sense 
<br>
pointless.  This question has been asked before, it has been answered before 
<br>
and then the points made by both sides have been debated.  Were you to 
<br>
suddenly have a change of heart you have the knowledge to present the 
<br>
American case better than the average American.  Yet you continue to recycle 
<br>
the same arguments hoping apparently to catch the unwary and win them for 
<br>
your side.  We are making a pre-emptive strike against a man that is 
<br>
preparing to hit us.  There is a strong possibility that if we allow him 
<br>
additional time he will succeed in hitting either us or one of our friends.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you know all this so the real question is why do you want to see 
<br>
more Americans die?  Why do you want to drag out affairs until Sadaam has the 
<br>
weapons ready to hit us or others?
<br>
