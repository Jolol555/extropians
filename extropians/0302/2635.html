<p>It's just a classical Turing machine. All real computers are subject to
<br>
hardware errors, and therefore are not deterministic. I'm assuming that
<br>
the decision maker has access to a truly deterministic computer that does
<br>
not suffer from hardware errors, or can perform deterministic computations
<br>
in his head without error.
<br>
<p>Here's a quote from Greg Egan's &quot;Singleton&quot; (available at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.netspace.net.au/~gregegan/MISC/SINGLETON/Singleton.html">http://www.netspace.net.au/~gregegan/MISC/SINGLETON/Singleton.html</a>). The 
<br>
AI running in the Qusp is an example of someone who can do deterministic 
<br>
computations in his head.
<br>
<p>Back in my office, I summoned up a schematic of the device I called the 
<br>
Qusp: the quantum singleton processor. The Qusp would employ all the 
<br>
techniques designed to shield the latest generation of quantum computers 
<br>
from entanglement with their environment, but it would use them to a very 
<br>
different end. A quantum computer was shielded so it could perform a 
<br>
multitude of parallel calculations, without each one spawning a separate 
<br>
history of its own, in which only one answer was accessible. The Qusp 
<br>
would perform just a single calculation at a time, but on its way to the 
<br>
unique result it would be able to pass safely through superpositions that 
<br>
included any number of alternatives, without those alternatives being made 
<br>
real. Cut off from the outside world during each computational step, it 
<br>
would keep its temporary quantum ambivalence as private and 
<br>
inconsequential as a daydream, never being forced to act out every 
<br>
possibility it dared to entertain.
<br>
<p>The Qusp would still need to interact with its environment whenever it 
<br>
gathered data about the world, and that interaction would inevitably split 
<br>
it into different versions. If you attached a camera to the Qusp and 
<br>
pointed it at an ordinary object ? a rock, a plant, a bird ? that object 
<br>
could hardly be expected to possess a single classical history, and so 
<br>
neither would the combined system of Qusp plus rock, Qusp plus plant, Qusp 
<br>
plus bird.
<br>
<p>The Qusp itself, though, would never initiate the split. In a given set of 
<br>
circumstances, it would only ever produce a single response. An AI running 
<br>
on the Qusp could make its decisions as whimsically, or with as much 
<br>
weighty deliberation as it liked, but for each distinct scenario it 
<br>
confronted, in the end it would only make one choice, only follow one 
<br>
course of action.
