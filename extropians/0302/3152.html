John Clark writes

<p><em>&gt; 3) It's counterintuitive but for some strange reason the war
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    supporters seem like nicer people that the anti-war crowd
</em><br>
<p>I'd like to know on what you base your impressions.  This list?
<br>
Media depictions?  Apparent personalities of the protest marchers?
<br>
<p>Hubert writes in to agree:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, it is not counterintuitive at all.  People who support war do the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing to their ancient brain rudiments which call for unconditional defense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your own territory.  If you do so, the appropriate neuropeptides are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; released and all you fine young cannibals feel pretty relaxed because you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have done the right thing.  That's why you appear to be the nicer people.
</em><br>
<p>Whatever the value of Hubert's physiological theories---and I don't think that
<br>
he put them forth seriously, it's weird that he agrees with the observation.
<br>
<p>I'm skeptical.  That's because for many decades I've been on the
<br>
lookout for any and all signs of correlation between ideology
<br>
and sociability or cooperativeness.  And I've seen nothing
<br>
really noteworthy.
<br>
<p>Now the far left is vastly better organized than the far right.
<br>
It's a commonplace observation as to which groups coordinated
<br>
the peace marchers.  Their conservative opposites simply do not
<br>
*have* comparable organizations.  (It's all a legacy of the
<br>
20th century fight for socialism around the world.)
<br>
<p>Therefore, more leftist assholes get before the cameras, and 
<br>
their shrill diatribes penetrate much further and get more
<br>
exposure than do their equally misanthropic opposite numbers
<br>
on the other extreme.  Is that what's being talked about here?
<br>
