</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thing bugs me however - the acquisition of the land for roads would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be quite difficult. You couldn't use eminent domain (or could you?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A single holdout on the path of a planned highway could demand a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of cash, or scuttle the project altogether (e.g., the owner of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mountain pass). This would drive up the prices. Also, in certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; situations, if the ownership of roads in an area became concentrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in one hand, there would be the risk of monopoly rents being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; extracted from the citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; How could you solve these problems?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Set up a public board (perhaps on the web), with a map divided into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small plots, or using the actual property lines, and announce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planning to build a road from point A to point B.  Anyone on the map
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can post the price for their property, even if not on a direct line
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between A and B.  If participation is low,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can offer incentives to visit the site.  When enough people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made offers that the map is fairly well covered with land which has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price, you can pick the few routes with the least apparent cost, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to negotiate them down.  Each person you're negotiating with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understands that you're looking for the lowest cost, and trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold out for more money makes it more likely that you'll just go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around.
</em><br>
<p>### This is a very juicy piece of stuff to think about.
<br>
<p>The placement of a road involves a number of trade-offs, between keeping it
<br>
short (increasing the long-term efficiency), simple to build from an
<br>
engineering standpoint (for a short-term gain but at a long-term efficiency
<br>
loss), and cheap to build depending on land price (short-term gain vs. long
<br>
term loss if a longer but cheaper route is built).  You could actually
<br>
publish a map containing the calculated relative prices for each piece of
<br>
land that you are willing to pay based on the trade-offs. The property
<br>
owners could see how important their particular piece of land is to the
<br>
builder, and perhaps would not be motivated to ask for more because of an
<br>
additional consideration - if you block the building of the optimal road by
<br>
refusing to sell your land (if it's located within the shortest and simplest
<br>
route), the builder could build around you, but refuse to give you access to
<br>
the road. You would have all the hassle of having a road (noise) but no
<br>
benefit. The optimal solution for the property owner would be to sell the
<br>
land at the price derived from the calculation of efficiency and the average
<br>
land price in the area. Of course this would depend on the judicial
<br>
standards regarding liability for noise and pollution.
<br>
<p>I can see that the complicated mechanism I proposed is an attempt to produce
<br>
the economically optimal outcome (the shortest and chapest route) in 100% of
<br>
cases, but at an administrative cost. The simpler system described by
<br>
Randall should work less efficiently, because sometimes the land owners
<br>
would still block the optimal route (especially in cases of high
<br>
concentration of land ownership), but the administrative cost would be
<br>
lower. Richard Epstein wrote that trying to fix a rule that works 95% is
<br>
usually not worth the extra cost, and simplicity usually trumps complexity.
<br>
<p>OK, I agree that Randall's system would most likely work, and it is possible
<br>
that it would work better than the hostile buyout system but I'd rather like
<br>
to see these methods tried in practice and compared in real life. May the
<br>
better (cheaper, more efficient) win.
