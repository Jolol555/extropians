</em><br>
<p>I had a sort of rough &quot;game theory&quot; model which really is
<br>
too long to post that involved giving Saddam two very stark
<br>
choices surrender himself into UN custody and live out his life
<br>
in some sort of newly formed UN sin-bin with his personal
<br>
security guaranteed by the security council (including the US) 
<br>
and plenty of opportunity to write his life story on how he
<br>
came to be him - ie. he could serve some practical use as a
<br>
bad example and a living illustration of an alternate fate for other
<br>
despots the Security Council might call out, so long as he was 
<br>
separated from the levers of power, why not let him enjoy a
<br>
little media celebrity status. As the price for getting him out of
<br>
Iraq without a war it seems cheap. 
<br>
<p>With a sin-bid established the Security Council would have
<br>
something to offer rough state leaders as a slightly better
<br>
&nbsp;incentive to turn themselves over without a fight. That would
<br>
be the carrot. The stick would be that if he didn't turn himself 
<br>
over in 24 hours say of getting the offer it would be revoked 
<br>
and a price would go on his head. Say 50 million euros 
<br>
dead or alive. Of course this sort of clear choice is hard to
<br>
present to Saddam and be taken at face value if the Security
<br>
Council can't present a united face. Quite simply Saddam can't
<br>
make choices he isn't given. 
<br>
<p>In the game theory example I outlined in an earlier post I said
<br>
Bush should approach Chirac as a first step and ask him to 
<br>
articulate a general standard of proof that the security council
<br>
(including France as a permanent member could use as the
<br>
hurdle that needs to be cleared to get a go to war decision on 
<br>
any particular case). Bush seems to have opted instead to try
<br>
and get a new resolution up without going directly to Chirac. 
<br>
This seems like a suboptimal move to me. If Bush prepares a
<br>
role for Chirac as the one that stood up to the US despite
<br>
overwhelming pressure to fold he is likely to find he is throwing
<br>
brear rabbit into the briar patch. The more Bush goes after
<br>
Chirac and Chirac holds out the tougher and more principled
<br>
Chirac looks. In actual fact the Security Council *needs* a 
<br>
practical standard of proof as a general principle (irrespective
<br>
of the particulars of Iraq) in order to carry out its Article 1
<br>
mandate of maintaining international peace and security
<br>
effectively. If the Security Council won't or can't accept
<br>
the responsibility for maintaining security (including threats
<br>
of the new kind) then it is not fulfilling its raison detre. And if
<br>
Chirac did not come up with a standard when publicly asked
<br>
to do so Chirac would loose any claim to the high moral 
<br>
ground and Bush would be justified in treating the Security
<br>
Council with any such impractical a permanent member with
<br>
veto powers on it as unworkable. And the world could be
<br>
shown that it was Chirac not Bush that failed to rise to the 
<br>
challenge of the moment.
<br>
<p>But it *is* Bush's move and if he chooses to move badly or
<br>
fails to move optimally his move does determine the board 
<br>
everyone else gets to play on. Right now it looks to me 
<br>
that Bush is fiddling with the wrong &quot;chess piece&quot;. Looks like
<br>
he's going to try and further isolate France. That's a 
<br>
suboptimal move and Bush not Chirac would be responsible
<br>
for it. The suboptimal move like poor generalship hurts all 
<br>
sides more.
