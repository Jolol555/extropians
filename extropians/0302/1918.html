<p>Umm...you completely missed my point.  NASA has no interest in doing
<br>
this, and it believes it has reason *not* to allow other people to use
<br>
its stuff in this manner - and can clamp the State Department down on
<br>
any Americans, or anyone who does business with Americans, who try to
<br>
get foreign space agencies to do this kind of thing.  (Unless said
<br>
people are the super-rich, and as such have political connections they
<br>
could retaliate with.)  It has more direct control over its own
<br>
contractors who might otherwise collaborate with such schemes.  So,
<br>
whose rockets are you going to re-use?
