Excerpts from the Ed Hooks Newsletter Mid-February '03.
<br>
<p>~~
<br>
<p>Please forgive this mid-month newsletter.  I wanted to get it to you
<br>
right away because, in the craft notes, I'm encouraging my readers to
<br>
see a movie that is currently playing in the theatres.  If I wait
<br>
until March, the movie may close.  It is best if you see this on the
<br>
big screen.
<br>
<p>....
<br>
<p>CRAFT NOTES
<br>
&quot;Gollum: A peek into the Future of Acting...&quot;
<br>
<p>Most of my readers know that I am the author of a book entitled
<br>
&quot;Acting for Animators&quot; and that I teach acting to animators in
<br>
addition to teaching it to actors.  I also write a monthly newsletter
<br>
for animators that you can subscribe to if you are interested.
<br>
(<a href="http://www.ActingforAnimators.com">http://www.ActingforAnimators.com</a>)  Usually I keep the world of
<br>
animators and that of actors separate because animators neither
<br>
perceive nor apply acting theory the same way that stage actors do.
<br>
Animators, for one thing, do not have a &quot;present moment&quot;.  They have
<br>
only the indication of a present moment in their work.
<br>
<p>In this month's newsletter, however, I want to speak to my
<br>
actor-readers about animation because something significant is
<br>
happening.  Playing now in first-run is a movie entitled &quot;The Lord of
<br>
the Rings - Two Towers&quot;.  It features a unique character named Gollum
<br>
that is a hybrid of live-action and animation.  Gollum was developed
<br>
in large part by an actor named Andy Serkis and then brought to the
<br>
screen by a blazingly talented team of animators at Weta Digital in
<br>
New Zealand.  He is not a background character.  He is a second lead
<br>
in the movie with single-card opening credit billing, playing full
<br>
tilt scenes of emotional depth with live actors.   His creation rests
<br>
on a nexus between two different disciplines, and that is why this is
<br>
historic and noteworthy.   Gollum is a harbinger of what actors may
<br>
expect in the future of movies.   Therefore, actors, acting teachers
<br>
and executives from SAG and AFTRA should all be paying close
<br>
attention.
<br>
<p>GOLLUM'S DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS
<br>
Director Peter Jackson hired actor Andy Serkis and then gave him a
<br>
lot of latitude to develop the character of Gollum.  This is
<br>
different from the way that animated characters are typically
<br>
developed.  In a movie like &quot;Shrek&quot; or &quot;Monsters, Incorporated&quot;, the
<br>
animators develop the character first and then hire the actor to go
<br>
into a recording studio and do the voice.  They videotape the actor
<br>
while he is recording the script, and they use this footage as a
<br>
reference to correctly animate and further enhance the character.
<br>
Also, in a typical animated film, actors work individually, in
<br>
isolation.  It is rare for two actors to play a scene in real time in
<br>
a recording studio.  Romeo is recorded in a studio in Austria, and
<br>
Juliet is recorded in LA, and the animation company puts it all
<br>
together.
<br>
<p>Gollum was different.  Andy Serkis himself played all the scenes with
<br>
the other actors, and it was shot as live-action.  In scenes where
<br>
Serkis is making physical contact with the other actors, as in the
<br>
opening sequence fight, the animators digitally replaced Serkis's
<br>
image with that of the animated Gollum on a frame by frame basis.
<br>
<p>Serkis also worked with the motion-capture process, donning a rubber
<br>
body suit with sensors on it and slithering around over the rocks in
<br>
the mountains.  In those scenes, the animators used Serkis's basic
<br>
movements, but they animated the face of Gollum by themselves.
<br>
<p>There were other digital tricks, a basket full of them in fact.  My
<br>
point here is that, in the future, actors will find it necessary to
<br>
understand animation process as well as acting theory.  In interviews
<br>
with Andy Serkis, I note that he speaks comfortably about things like
<br>
&quot;key frame&quot; and &quot;pose to pose&quot;, both being animation terms.  He
<br>
understands how motion-capture works and what &quot;rotoscope&quot; is.  In
<br>
other words, as he was creating the character, he had in his head
<br>
that the final character would be a collaborative thing, that
<br>
whatever he did as an actor had to fit with what the animators would
<br>
later do.
<br>
<p>Gollum is a hobbit, a little person.  And he is a physically withered
<br>
and altered hobbit because, in the story, he long ago stole the magic
<br>
ring.  Gollum is half the size of Andy Serkis, and he moves around
<br>
primarily on all fours instead of erect.  He is frog like, lizard
<br>
like, a hairless quasi-human that possesses a full trunk of human
<br>
emotion.
<br>
<p>As I sat in a Chicago theatre watching Gollum on screen, I felt I was
<br>
gazing into the future.  How will SAG deal with this kind of
<br>
development?  How will the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
<br>
Sciences deal with it?  There was a campaign afoot to get a Best
<br>
Supporting Oscar nomination for Andy Serkis this year, but it failed.
<br>
I have a hunch it failed not because Gollum is not brilliant but
<br>
because the Academy members simply didn't know what to do with this.
<br>
Is Gollum Animation?  Yes, sort of.  Is Gollum live-action?  Yes,
<br>
sort of.  He is both, a hybrid.  Do we need a new category for such
<br>
characters?
<br>
<p>Even if you are not a fan of the Lord of the Rings books, I suggest
<br>
you check this out.  Focus on Gollum.  Observe how perfectly he
<br>
interfaces with Elija Wood and the other actors.  You watch Gollum on
<br>
screen, and you accept his reality.  He appears to be live-action,
<br>
but he is not.  It is mind blowing, and it is a historic achievement.
