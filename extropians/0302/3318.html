<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any good references, or details on [Socrates and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Peloponnesian War]?  I didn't study really any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancient Grecian history, but as I recall Socrates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't write any books, and his followers only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documented things in their aftermaths.
</em><br>
<p>My reference was the book &quot;The Trial of Socrates&quot;, by
<br>
I. F. Stone (of all people).  1988.  In it his famous
<br>
crime of &quot;corrupting the youth&quot; was, so far as I recall,
<br>
suggesting that the defense of Athens was unimportant.
<br>
But it has been ten years at least since I read that.
<br>
<p>However, I do thank you for your challenge, because now
<br>
with the help of St. Google I find
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.brothersjudd.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/reviews.detail/book_id/747">http://www.brothersjudd.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/reviews.detail/book_id/747</a>
<br>
<p>which appears to be quite a good review of that book.  In
<br>
this review, Stone's motivations are held up to the light,
<br>
and perhaps his conclusions should be questioned.
<br>
<p>Now when I wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Cory writes]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I've never read in a history book of an invaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; land...and I mean close enough proximity to see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; where people were holding a peace protest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not scrambling for their lives.  Am I wrong?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes.  Athens in the Peloponnesian War:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; While Spartan forces were marauding the countryside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; around Athens, the asshole Socrates and others were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; saying everything pro-Sparta that they could think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of.  A certain playwright was advocating peace and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disarmament in his theatrical productions.
</em><br>
<p>I was referring to the following passage in Victor Davis
<br>
Hanson's &quot;Carnage and Culture&quot;, p. 434:  &quot;The comic playwright
<br>
Aristophanes also wrote several plays---Acharnians, Peace,
<br>
and Lysistrata---that ridicule the endless traffic in
<br>
war charges that the profiteer and the megalomaniac
<br>
are more interested in themselves than in the citizens.
<br>
While a Spartan army marched through the countryside of
<br>
Athens, the Athenian populace watched its own citizens
<br>
denigrate the policy of forced evacuation and continued
<br>
war with Sparta.&quot;
<br>
<p>But I do *not* have specific information at hand that
<br>
absolutely links Socrates himself to the anti-war protests,
<br>
and for this I must apologize.  I think that I was also 
<br>
unconsciously making the usual error of mixing up Plato
<br>
and Socrates because in &quot;Carnage and Culture&quot; on page 433
<br>
there is this passage:
<br>
<p>&quot;Jane Fonda dallied with her nation's enemies, precisely
<br>
as did Athenian rightists who fawned over Sparta in the
<br>
closing months of the Peloponnesian War.  Plato, remember,
<br>
in a near treasonous outburst called the great victory at
<br>
Salamis [against the Persians now!] a mistake that had
<br>
made the Athenians worse as a people.&quot;
<br>
<p>First, though, I have to speak up for Jane Fonda
<br>
and the other war protestors (!)
<br>
<p>Suppose that Russian armies camped in Mexico and Canada
<br>
were invading the United States, and our own brave soldiers
<br>
were fighting a hopeless, losing battle.  I cannot imagine
<br>
Jane Fonda or any of the usual anti-war types under *conditions
<br>
like those that faced Athens* engaging in such outright treason.
<br>
Vietnam, after all, was far away, and her friends and neighbors
<br>
under no direct threat.
<br>
<p>Oh, sure, there'd be a few complete crackpots, or the
<br>
usual vicious sort attempting to gain favor with what
<br>
appeared to be the eventual victor.  But what has changed
<br>
our society since the time of Athens?  (Note that all the
<br>
anti-war protestors on this list, so far as I can see,
<br>
would still stand up for their country at a moment when
<br>
the survival of their nation in their eyes was truly on
<br>
the line.)
<br>
<p>The Romans changed us.  Everyone in the West unconsciously
<br>
has been affected.  We have imbued the idea of what a nation
<br>
and a citizen should be from the Romans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The worst crime of it was that a number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were listening to Socrates, and applauding those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; productions, and this at a time when Spartan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tyranny was well-known.  So next time some loony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leftist seems to be going beyond all reason, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remember that so did &quot;the wisest of them all&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wisest of all leftists, or the wisest of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans?
</em><br>
<p>Many have supposed Socrates to be the wisest of all
<br>
philosophers.  And since philosophers are the wisest
<br>
of all humans, ipso facto.  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Alas, some people's emotions, healthy prejudices,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and natural human common sense are simply broken.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, actually he didn't die until a later trial which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even then he could have chosen to flee rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become an intellectual martyr, so until I find out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of his motives, and the scenario, I can't say for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain that Socrates common sense was really broken.  
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  We have to retry Socrates' case yet again!  :-)
<br>
<p>The link above is only a start; there were a number of
<br>
other links that popped up when I googled for &quot;The Trial
<br>
of Socrates&quot;.  Let us know what you conclude.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
