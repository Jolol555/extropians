Avatar posts, IMO, an eloquent piece which I reproduce below
<br>
in its entirety.
<br>
<p>But at one point diverges in three different directions with
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally I see continuous broadcast linkage as an option,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but uploading as a great fallacy equal to that of belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a soul.
</em><br>
<p>Unlike your great previous remarks, this doesn't seem to follow
<br>
from anything.  What are your reasons for rejecting uploading?
<br>
<p>(And we better be sure of what we mean.  By &quot;uploading&quot; most
<br>
people here, I think, mean the creation of a computer program
<br>
or some other kind of non-biologic entity that would initially
<br>
have the same or equivalent subjective experiences as the original.
<br>
By &quot;equivalent&quot;, I mean to allow that my experiences last month
<br>
are just as representative of me as my experiences today.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Tipler's quantum splitting is understandable to me but there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be no evidence of a soul.
</em><br>
<p>Yes; but this juxtaposition seems to indicate that you connect
<br>
*uploading* with *Tipler*.  Tipler's Omega point in effect does
<br>
upload everyone (as I have characterized &quot;upload&quot; above), but
<br>
many kinds of uploading are possible for us long before the
<br>
Omega Point is reached (if ever it is reached).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Atomic level near-duplicates of me would have to mourn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the permanent death of their near-twin or parent.
</em><br>
<p>I want to know why you do not consider your present atomic
<br>
configuration to be a near-duplicate of your state yesterday.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Uploading is merely childbirth with your parent's memories attached.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, I see that differently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this sense it would be unethical to create a new being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without seeking consent to insert memories of the parent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, if reincarnation were possible it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be unethical to insert memories into the developing fetus.
</em><br>
<p>And this is the third divergence that you've gone off on
<br>
(which is fine).  But a fetus has no memories.  Therefore
<br>
it will acquire at random new memories from its random
<br>
experiences.  (We must consider experiences of a newborn
<br>
in a highly emphemeralized world of the 21st century to
<br>
be quite random---they are subject to fluctuations caused
<br>
by millions of unpredictable people.)
<br>
<p>What makes new random memories preferable to the old?
<br>
Reminiscent of the way that many on this list highly 
<br>
value the memories and experiences of 85 year olds,
<br>
your seem to be claiming that null memories are 
<br>
preferable to an 85 year old's, or at least that
<br>
the {destruction of 85-year-old's memories + insertion
<br>
of new random memories} is to you preferable to a
<br>
continuation of the 85-year-old's experiences.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Subject: Re: Where the I is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is a cloud an &quot;illusion&quot;?  Is something that is constantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; shifting for that reason &quot;illusion&quot;?  If so, then what does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; matter?  Matter itself is consistently shifting at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamental level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our forthcoming control of our neural patterning will mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can choose to keep memories or thought types subject only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the limits of our storage capabilities and control capabilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These would seem to be under current understanding about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 200 million times the current level, more if augmentation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater or biological componentry is replaced. Currently our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurons and their firing pattern do change and some die, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generically they do not regrow, nor disappear when we sleep, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuity is a principle. Change, then, is interlinked with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuity currently (there are principles at work, directions).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the future we will be able to choose these. Those who adopt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stasis scenarios are making a valid choice, although whether this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be adhered to over scales of over 10-100 billion years is yet to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined (even with external memory sources).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The self is informed by the actions of others. We know this from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studies of animals raised without contact. The self exists neurologically,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which we know from the effects of brain defects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fused twins who brains are partially fused still do not share much even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the motor-sensory level, from my readings. Therefore the sense of self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is linked to the map of the brain as it stands. To interlink the sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self with another individual will require specially designed interfacing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewiring of the brain. Interlinking of the senses is another matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our sense of self is lodged somewhere in the architecture of our brains, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a lesser sense in some other species. Possibly it is a combination of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generic facillities, some form of &quot;opening&quot; between compartments of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain and specialized centres.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally emotionally I see the self as informed by the actions of others,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surrounded by an egoshield with a subconscious and superconscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (altruistic level).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brain design indicates different levels of evolutionary development present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the brain. In this sense, an additional &quot;layer&quot; could be nanofilaments of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computronium and also molecular supercomputers/cell repair machines inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each neuron/dendrite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pesonally I see continuous broadcast linkage as an option, but uploading as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a great fallacy equal to that of belief in a soul. Tipler's quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; splitting is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understandable to me but there seems to be no evidence of a soul. I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course create a soul if that were possible. But in the absence of it or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof of Tipler I would never upload. Atomic level near-duplicates of me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have to mourn the permanent death of their near-twin or parent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uploading is merely childbirth with your parent's memories attached. In this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense it would be unethical to create a new being without seeking consent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insert memories of the parent. Similarly, if reinacarnation were possible it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be unethical to insert memories into the developing fetus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is something I haven't fully appreciated before. New beings, whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or silicon-based or whatever, deserve to have the capacity to self-boost and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will present, at least upon reaching maturation within fairly defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limits, and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserve to have the option of accepting or rejecting memories. The issue of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;instincts&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is there of course, and in the world of designer brains this is a debate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (see Greg Egan).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nonetheless the rights of the child do seem to argue against many versions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of uploading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fiction.
