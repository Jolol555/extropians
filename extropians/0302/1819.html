<em>&gt; Peace and war are very complex matter.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. Mostly because it's not a 1:1 game like chess (or WWII in 
<br>
Europe). And most regions are so complex with respect to ethnics, 
<br>
politican and monetary interests, that as soon one starts to get 
<br>
involved, risks to become a target himself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another analogy: Jews in WWII and now are in the same situation! When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US/West will not act Saddam will do the Second Holocaust. You doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it?
</em><br>
<p>Yes I doubt about it, as far as Iraq and Saddam are concerned. He 
<br>
currently has nothing to win with a war. Every open aggression would 
<br>
immediately bring up the coalition of 90/91 again. It's therfore much 
<br>
wiser for him to play as dead and innocent as he does. If there's one 
<br>
thing he's an expert in, it is to keep his position, even if an 
<br>
international arm invades his country. (I'd still like to know why the 
<br>
last US-invasion was stopped so sonn. Can anybody enlighten me on this?) 
<br>
<p>And Saddam simply has no business with Israel. He isn't a fanatic muslim 
<br>
either, but has violently destroyed every political and religious 
<br>
opposition, especially the religious groups. That's why bin Ladin will 
<br>
most probably neither find shelter nor help in Iraq, and will probably 
<br>
not send Al-Quaida to help Saddam.
<br>
<p>Saddam _may_ have B or C weapons (while his army has only 1/3 of its 
<br>
strength after the last gulf war). What could he probably do with them? 
<br>
Use them? Against whom? If such an attack could be traced back to him, he 
<br>
would risk the total destruction of his system, his family, his wealth. 
<br>
IMO he'd only use WMDs (which means B or C, because even the US hasn't 
<br>
the slightest evidence of a nuclear programme in Iraq) when he has 
<br>
nothing left to lose, i.e. when invading military knocks on his palace 
<br>
doors.
<br>
<p>It could be much more sensible, to send many more (hundreds, thousands) 
<br>
inspectors, use every information available, satellites, spy planes, 
<br>
drones, whatever, and at the same time support political alternatives and 
<br>
spread the news into Iraq. Prepare the grounds, sort out the complex 
<br>
political system, then finally give the system the last push over the 
<br>
brink to fall into a new stable position.
<br>
<p>A military action in the current situation will only mess up the whole 
<br>
region and make it much more difficult to keep the situation under 
<br>
control.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We should be proactiv, help to build democracy in the muslim world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and China, reconstruct UN towards World Republic, etc. Peace is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible among democratic states.
</em><br>
<p>I totally agree. But I am also more than sceptical, that the current US 
<br>
administrations serves well as the spearhead of international law, mutual 
<br>
respect and freedom and democracy for all people. I rather suspect, that 
<br>
the current regime would prefer a totally US controlled world politics, 
<br>
if someway possible.
