<p><em>&gt; I am still not seeing how [Chernobyl] is worse than the 3 million people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are dying every year, right now.  Do you feel that this number is perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inaccurate?  You lost some veggies and some lambs, while 3 million people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every year lose there lives.
</em><br>
<p>I've always thought that figures such as these---three million---do
<br>
need to be adjusted for &quot;expected number of years of life lost&quot;.
<br>
That is, although it's still a tragedy, the loss of an eighty-five
<br>
year old ought not to be regarded with the sense of loss as a
<br>
fifteen year old.  Their deaths (on the first reading) cannot
<br>
be equated because the eighty-five year old is nearly certain
<br>
to die anyway shortly.  And, if I recall correctly, your figure
<br>
did pertain to the elderly or already very fragile.
<br>
<p>(That being said, of course, it's still always important for
<br>
extropians and cryonicists to emphasize that so far as we
<br>
know, all deaths today are needless.  The technology currently
<br>
exists to banish death (again, so far as we know).  Hence, from
<br>
this point of view, one can consider the death of an 85 year
<br>
old to be an even *greater* tragedy.)
<br>
<p>So concerns about the safety of nuclear reactors which could
<br>
kill hundreds---or of coal mines which presently DO KILL 
<br>
hundreds---should be compared to traffic accidents, or other
<br>
statistics which automatically take into account natural 
<br>
lifespan, it seems to me.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Citing Chernobyl as an example of unsafe nuclear reactors is like citing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; titanic as a reason to think cruise liners are unsafe.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, good point!
