</em><br>
<p>I've read through your essay on qualia but I'm going to have to read it
<br>
again and think about it some more to understand how it fits.  To me, the
<br>
idea of qualia implies a recursively nested &quot;Cartesian theater&quot;  scenario,
<br>
requiring at each level a homunculus to observe the play.
<br>
<p>If take a look at the behavior of a complex system with multiple feedback
<br>
loops, you might feel that it is amazingly responsive to it's environment,
<br>
but you won't necessarily find any one-to-one mapping or representation of
<br>
the outside world within the system begin examined.  You could try to build
<br>
it that way, but it wouldn't be efficient, and at the lowest level the
<br>
mapping wouldn't hold true.
<br>
<p>I tend to like Buckminster Fuller's simple analogy, that our consciousness
<br>
is like a slipknot moving along a piece of string and it doesn't matter what
<br>
it's made of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An &quot;illusion&quot; is some real conscious knowledge that inaccurately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represents its referent.  For example, our knowledge of a pencil in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glass of water is not straight when the real pencil in the real glass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of water is actually straight. We call this an illusion because our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious knowledge doesn't accurately represent its referent.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just saying it is an &quot;illusion&quot; doesn't mean our conscious knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't exist!  We know, more than we know anything else, that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious knowledge of the pencil exists regardless of the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is an illusion and not straight.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are saying that when we observe something, even if we are seeing
<br>
an illusion, the fact remains that we are observing something and forming a
<br>
mental model based on our perceptions, and that we are conscious that we are
<br>
experiencing this mental model.  I would not deny that.
<br>
<p>I think you misunderstood my statement that our sense of self is an
<br>
illusion.  I'm not saying our sense of self doesn't exist.  I am saying that
<br>
it's not what we think it is.  We conventionally think our &quot;self&quot; is
<br>
continuous, basically rational, and that it generally follows along with a
<br>
kind of serial narrative that we observe.  I'm saying that these
<br>
observations are often false, illusory, changing with time (even to the
<br>
extent of cause and effect reversed) and secondary to the primary processes
<br>
that are occuring in the brain.
<br>
<p>IF you accept that our sense of self is far from what it really is, then we
<br>
get to my main point, which is the following:  How and why do we value so
<br>
strongly this sense of self, that we are learning is not at all what it
<br>
seems?  I suggest that we value it almost solely for evolutionary-based
<br>
reasons, and that moving beyond this limited view may provide a richer range
<br>
and sense of consciousness, a more rational approach to living and achieving
<br>
goals, but a diminished sense of individual self. (No, I'm not promoting
<br>
communism. &lt;g&gt;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
----------snip----------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the web is already self aware!  Google stores lots of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the web.
</em><br>
<p>There's a lot of storage, and a sunstantial amount of processing being done,
<br>
but not even close to the type of organization and behavior that I would
<br>
call self-aware. I see virtually zero evidence of introspection and
<br>
self-modification in the dynamics of the Web.  What do you see that
<br>
indicates to you that the Web is self-aware?
<br>
<p>Its just that this mathematical knowledge isn't
<br>
<em>&gt; phenomenally conscious knowledge of the web like that which exists in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our brains.
