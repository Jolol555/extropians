<em>&gt; Chirac invokes 'New Europe' ire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chirac has been widely condemned in the candidate countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; French President Jacques Chirac's criticism of the East European EU
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applicants' support for the US stance on Iraq has generated a wide debate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and angry reaction in the press in those countries. The following are quotes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from newspapers from across the region.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Czech Republic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The French president is without doubt walking on thin ice when he tries to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; base European foreign policy on the principle of anti-Americanism. His
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory does not even have the support of the majority of EU member states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hospodarske Noviny 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All Central European nations are used to the interpretations that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries have more rights than others. They are also used to furious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tirades, followed by tanks. If Chirac wants to revive the spirit of Leonid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brezhnev and renew the doctrine of limited sovereignty, which means fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights for some countries, it is his own affair.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mlada Fronta Dnes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The EU is a realistic kind of club where it's all about political power and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pushing through the aims of individual states. And when it gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncomfortable for EU politicians to take on board new countries, they calmly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throw them overboard, for instance over their attitude to the USA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lidove Noviny 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hungary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chirac is probably not alone in his views, even if the politicians of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; EU states put things more diplomatically. However, the two camps, split over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Iraq affair, both seek the favours of the central and east-central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; European states which, owing to their Nato and expected EU membership, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grown in value. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Magyar Hirlap 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Specific eastern European views has now become an unavoidable presence in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the set of values of the expanding EU. It was no coincidence that, following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the adoption of the joint stance, the French president criticized in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unusually sharp language those candidate states which had been urging a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firmer EU-US stand on Iraq.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; All right, Monsieur Chirac. Perhaps we are poor. Perhaps we were not raised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properly. We do not know about fine wine and the various directions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avant-garde art. But we do not repay those who have helped us and who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue to help us with ingratitude.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps there are some in Paris who want to be the patriarch of Europe's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;family&quot;, letting others in the family &quot;knock on the door&quot; humbly. By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denying the right of others to hold independent views, however, France runs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a risk of being alone with its own view.

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paris's attempt to ruin EU enlargement may lead to a rift in the EU. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this scenario would be a nightmare even for France itself, which is trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to proclaim itself as the strongest EU power.

<em>&gt; It seems France, the nation with old pedagogical traditions, decided to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue educating the European juniors.

<em>&gt; Poland 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chirac allowed himself to say things which should not have been said...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Poland can make its own sovereign decisions about its views. EU membership
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must not deprive us of this right. Loyalty towards Paris should not mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subordination. Loyalty brings obligations on both sides.

<em>&gt; Romania 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; French President Jacques Chirac's harsh criticism of Romania and Bulgaria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for bad behaviour and recklessness for their support for the USA on Iraq is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without precedent... During the Gulf War Romania was criticised for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporting Iraq and it is now criticised for supporting the USA.

<em>&gt; Most senior politicians of sovereign states have no right to their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion, even if it is even more controversial than the &quot;Vilnius
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declaration&quot;. The &quot;cold shower&quot; was sudden but it did not come completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of the blue.

<em>&gt; Delo 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Slovakia 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jacques Chirac's degrading message to the candidate countries can actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be taken as a compliment. The French President admitted defeat in his rage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suddenly the 15 [EU members] succeeded in resolving within a couple of hours
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a matter on which they were not able to agree for months. It was the &quot;new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe&quot; which forced &quot;the old&quot; to overcome itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sme 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neither Slovakia, nor any other candidate country will enter the EU to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silent but in order to make their voice be heard more... After enlargement,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the EU will be different. Less French or German, less Chirac's. However, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse for that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pravda 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;When [Chirac] reproached the candidate countries for not having discussed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their attitudes with the others to a minimal extent at least, he forgot that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was mainly France and Germany who, since the very beginning, have taken a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative stance on a possible use of force against Iraq and on Turkey's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; request for ... military aid without asking about positions of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries.
