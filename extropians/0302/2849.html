<p>The Left isn't listening
<br>
<p>The Stop the War coalition is the greatest threat to any hope for a
<br>
democratic Iraq
<br>
<p>Nick Cohen
<br>
Sunday February 16, 2003
<br>
The Observer
<br>
<p>When Saddam is sent to rendezvous with a judge in The Hague, or a rope on a
<br>
lamppost, the democratic opposition in Iraq will need help. It has many
<br>
enemies: Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the CIA and the Foreign Office want to
<br>
replace the old tyrant with a new, compliant dictator - a Saddam without a
<br>
moustache. As the moment of decision arrives, Iraqi democrats and socialists
<br>
have discovered that their natural allies in the European Left don't want to
<br>
know them. They must add the shameless Stop the War coalition to the enemies
<br>
list.
<br>
<p>Iraq is the only country in the Arab world with a strong, democratic
<br>
movement. Yet I wonder how many who marched yesterday know of the
<br>
dissenters' existence. The demonstration's organisers have gone to great
<br>
lengths to censor and silence. How else could the self-righteous feel good
<br>
about themselves? The usual accusation when whites ignore brown-skinned
<br>
peoples is that of racism. It doesn't quite work in the Stop the War
<br>
coalition's case. The Socialist Workers Party, which dominates the alliance,
<br>
was happy to cohost the march with the reactionary British Association of
<br>
Muslims. The association had blotted its copybook by circulating a newspaper
<br>
which explained that apostasy from Islam is 'an offence punishable by
<br>
death'. But what the hell. In the interests of multi-culturalism, the SWP
<br>
ignored the protests of squeamish lefties and let that pass. The Trots
<br>
aren't Islamophobes, after all. The only Muslims they have a phobia about
<br>
are secular Iraqi Muslims who, shockingly, believe in human rights.
<br>
<p>The Iraqis made a fruitless appeal for fraternal solidarity last month. The
<br>
Kurdish leader Barham Salih flew to a meeting of the Socialist International
<br>
in Rome to argue for 'the imperative of freedom and liberation from fascism
<br>
and dictatorship'. Those marchers who affect to believe in pluralism should
<br>
find his arguments attractive, if they can suppress their prejudices long
<br>
enough to hear him out. Salih explained that the no-fly zones enforced by
<br>
the RAF and USAF had allowed his Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the
<br>
Kurdish Democratic Party to build a fair imitation of democratic state in
<br>
liberated northern Iraq. The Kurds promote the freedom of journalists, women
<br>
and religious and racial minorities. Naturally, the local supporters of
<br>
al-Qaeda agree with Baghdad that this intolerable liberal experiment must
<br>
end, and the Kurds are having to fight both Saddam and the fundamentalists.
<br>
<p>Salih was prepared for that: what he wasn't prepared for was the enmity of
<br>
the anti-war movement. Foolishly, he tried to reason with it. He pointed out
<br>
that the choice wasn't between war or peace. Saddam 'has been waging war for
<br>
decades and he has inflicted hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties.'
<br>
Indeed, he continued, the ethnic cleansing of the Kurds who are still under
<br>
Baghdad's control continues to this day. 'I do not want war and I do not
<br>
want civilian casualties, nor do those who are coming to our assistance,' he
<br>
said. 'But the war has already begun.'
<br>
<p>What, he then asked, about the strange insistence of the anti-war movement
<br>
that Iraqis must not be liberated until Israel withdraws from the occupied
<br>
territories? Would the converse apply? If the Palestinians were on the verge
<br>
of seeing Israeli rule overthrown, would hundreds of thousands take to the
<br>
streets of London and bellow that Palestinians could not get rid of Sharon
<br>
until Iraqis got rid of Saddam? Salih doubted it and also had little time
<br>
for those who say war should be opposed because 'it's all about oil'.
<br>
<p>So what? he asked. 'Iraqis know that their human rights have too often been
<br>
ignored because Iraqi oil was more important to the world than Iraqi lives.
<br>
It would be a good irony if at long last oil becomes a cause of our
<br>
liberation - if this is the case, then so be it. The oil will be a blessing
<br>
and not the curse that it has been for so long... So to those who say &quot;No
<br>
War&quot;, I say, of course &quot;yes&quot;, but we can only have &quot;No War&quot; if there is &quot;No
<br>
Dictatorship&quot; and &quot;No Genocide&quot;.'
<br>
<p>Readers with access to the internet can read the whole speech at
<br>
www.puk.org. I urge you to do so because you're never going to hear
<br>
democratic Iraqi voices if you rely on the anti-war movement. For most of
<br>
the time, the comrades pretend the Iraqi opposition doesn't exist.
<br>
<p>Harold Pinter is the most striking member of a British Left with its hands
<br>
over its ears. In 1988 he staged Mountain Language, a play about the banning
<br>
of Kurdish in Turkey. The conceit was all too realistic: the world would
<br>
never know of the suffering of the Kurds because the Kurds would never be
<br>
allowed to speak. ('Your language is forbidden,' an officer bellows at
<br>
Kurdish women. 'It is dead. No one is allowed to speak your language. Your
<br>
language no longer exists. Any questions?')
<br>
<p>In 2003 when Iraqi Kurds found the words to ask for aid in an anti-fascist
<br>
struggle, Pinter turned Pinteresque. He refused to hear the mountain tongue
<br>
he had once defended and became a noisy supporter of the Stop the War
<br>
coalition. The current issue of the left-wing magazine Red Pepper takes
<br>
evasion into outright falsehood. It condemns journalists - well, one
<br>
journalist, me - for being conned into believing the Iraqi opposition
<br>
supports war. Only American stooges in the Iraqi National Congress want war,
<br>
it announces with mendacious self-confidence. The main Iraqi parties - which
<br>
Red Pepper lists as the Kurdish Democratic Party, Supreme Council for the
<br>
Islamic Revolution and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan - are with the peace
<br>
protesters.
<br>
<p>It's a convincing case, spoilt only by the fact that the Iraqi National
<br>
Congress is an umbrella organisation whose members include the Kurdish
<br>
Democratic Party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution and,
<br>
indeed, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, whose leader flew to Europe to beg
<br>
the Left to get its priorities right and support a war against tyranny.
<br>
<p>If evasion and lies won't do, vilification is the last resort. The writings
<br>
of the Iraqi intellectual Kanan Makiya have inspired the opposition and
<br>
brought him many enemies, not least Saddam Hussein, who wants him dead.
<br>
Edward Said has been only slightly less forgiving. Makiya, he wrote
<br>
recently, is a man 'devoid of either compassion or real understanding, he
<br>
prattles on for Anglo-American audiences who seem satisfied that here at
<br>
last is an Arab who exhibits the proper respect for their power and
<br>
civilisation... He represents the intellectual who serves power
<br>
unquestioningly; the greater the power, the fewer doubts he has.'
<br>
<p>I like a good polemic and used to have some time for Said. But he too has
<br>
fled into denial. Like the rest of anti-war movement he refuses to
<br>
acknowledge that Makiya, Salih and their comrades are fighting the political
<br>
battle of their lives against those 'Anglo-American audiences' in the
<br>
powerhouses of London and Washington who oppose a democratic settlement.
<br>
(See Makiya's article on page 20.) The democrats are struggling without the
<br>
support of Western liberals and socialists because they don't fit into a pat
<br>
world view.
<br>
<p>Here's why. The conclusion the Iraqi opposition has reluctantly reached is
<br>
that there is no way other than war to remove a tyrant whose five secret
<br>
police forces make a palace coup or popular uprising impossible. As the only
<br>
military force on offer is provided by America, they will accept an American
<br>
invasion.
<br>
<p>This is their first mistake. American and British power is always bad in the
<br>
eyes of muddle-headed Left, the recent liberations of East Timor, Sierra
<br>
Leone and Kosovo notwithstanding.
<br>
<p>Then the uppity wogs compound their offence and tell their European betters
<br>
to think about the political complexities. The British and American
<br>
governments aren't monoliths, they argue. The State Department and the CIA
<br>
have always been the foes of Iraqi freedom. But they are countered by the
<br>
Pentagon and a US Congress which passed the Iraq Liberation Act in 1998 - a
<br>
law which instructs the American government to support democracy. Not one
<br>
Iraqi I have met trusts the Foreign Office. However, they have had a
<br>
grudging admiration for Tony Blair ever since he met the Kurdish leaders and
<br>
gave them a fair hearing - a courteous gesture which hasn't been matched by
<br>
the Pinters, Trotskyists, bishops, actresses and chorus girls on yesterday's
<br>
march.
<br>
<p>The Iraqis must now accept that they will have to fight for democracy
<br>
without the support of the British Left. Disgraceful though our failure to
<br>
hear them has been, I can't help thinking that they'll be better off without
<br>
us.
