[correcting my mistake on the following]

<em>&gt; &gt; (I provide the above just as background for those

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; met &quot;closed-door&quot; the two plans are not available for public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; viewing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The US/Britain/Spain draft resolution is posted at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/io/rls/othr/17937.htm">http://www.state.gov/p/io/rls/othr/17937.htm</a>, and it just says:
</em><br>
<p>I stand corrected on the plan not being publicly available. This
<br>
is good news. I think with the draft plan on the table it is much
<br>
easier to work on solutions. Thanks for the correction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OP1: Decides that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity afforded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to it in resolution 1441 (2002);
</em><br>
<p>I still think my argument that it is for the Security Council to decide when
<br>
the final opportunity as described in 1441 is at an end. I still think the
<br>
reasoning is valid on that point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OP2: Decides to remain seized of the matter.
</em><br>
<p>So did point 14 of 1441. It is because the Security Council
<br>
&nbsp;remains &quot;seized of the matter&quot; in 1441 that I don't think the
<br>
US can act unilaterally (or with a new coalition of the willing -
<br>
&nbsp;the UN itself was founded as a coalition of the willing) act
<br>
&nbsp;outside it without breaching the Charter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's an article which says that the Security Council must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicitly authorize force against Iraq for an invasion to be legal:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=2880">http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=2880</a> i</em><br>
<em>&gt; It  argues that just saying Iraq is in material breach isn't enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that the proposed U.S. resolution isn't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient either.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks I'll check it out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you think the consequences will be if the U.S. does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide to breach the U.N. charter and invade Iraq without an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicit authorization from the Security Council?
</em><br>
<p>This is still some time away, now that the draft resolution is on
<br>
the table and there is time to focus minds, there is I think a real
<br>
chance to make this whole exercise an extropic one. I.E. It is
<br>
possible that the Security Council may be able to rise up a notch.
<br>
It certainly seems to me that having a working Security Council
<br>
in the UN version 2.0 is better for the US than no UN at all - the
<br>
US would have to rebuild a &quot;new Union&quot; as a foreign policy
<br>
priority if the old could not be preserved. A world with a majority
<br>
of the worlds open societys governments and the majority of
<br>
the worlds open society citizens disenfranchised is not a
<br>
sustainable proposition. We already have better than that now.
<br>
And such runs counter to the sort of confidence that makes
<br>
globalisation work even economically.  The better solution is a
<br>
better UN not no UN.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, isn't the U.S. already in breach of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.N. charter by enforcing the no-fly zones, which were never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authorized by the Security Council?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know I haven't checked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about the 1989 Panama invasion, which was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authorized by the Security Council either?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know I haven't checked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I haven't been able to find any amendments to the U.N. charter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do any exist?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know. I have been presuming the Charter at the UN
<br>
home page is the current article. If it is not that could be very
<br>
significant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example has the Security Council chapter been amended to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change one of the permanent members from the Soviet Union to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russia?
</em><br>
<p>I think so. There is a list of Members of the United Nations
<br>
at the UN Web site and the Soviet Union has been replaced by the
<br>
Russian Federation. I also think I can recall this being talked about
<br>
years when the Soviet Union was dissembled.
