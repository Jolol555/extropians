<p>Actually it doesn't, but for a deeper cultural reason. The site (and
<br>
your post) seems to be based on zero-sum thinking. There is only a
<br>
finite amount of resources to go about, so hence all growth must
<br>
eventually stop. But the amount of stuff you can do with a certain
<br>
physical amount of resources *increases* as technology advances. You can
<br>
also make/reach more stuff, most of the current resource limits are
<br>
eminently removeable in the long run by ephemeralization and spatial
<br>
expansion.  There are hard outer limits of course - thermodynamics,
<br>
conservation of energy, lightspeed and so on. But the kind of world an
<br>
expansive mankind would form in the long run is vastly different from
<br>
the Malthusian heat death envisioned by the vhem.
<br>
<p>The environmental movement and quite a big chunk of our culture is
<br>
steeped in zero-sum thinking, making the issue dividing the cake and
<br>
then keeping the pieces in a sustainable way. Never the positive-sum
<br>
approach of increasing the size of the cake or finding ways of using it
<br>
better, which is the extropian approach. If you think in zero-sum terms
<br>
rather than positive sums, things become an issue of competition and 
<br>
ensuring that nobody gets more than their allotted share - you become 
<br>
the guardian of limited resources, and stasis is the best you can hope 
<br>
for. But there are plenty of win-win situations around. Unfortunately 
<br>
zero-sum thinking leads to a pessimistic approach that makes the 
<br>
believer discount any such opportunities, since it is so &quot;obvious&quot; that 
<br>
in the end nobody can ever win that there is no reason to look at 
<br>
proposed improvements. 
<br>
<p><p>Worrying about overpopulation is becoming increasingly outdated; note 
<br>
how aid organisations have shifted towards fighting poverty - birth 
<br>
rates are falling, and the big problem complex is more about human 
<br>
lacking wealth to build their lives than there being too many of them. 
<br>
Life extension is in any case not a major population-booster (see the 
<br>
numerous past discussions about this issue), especially given that 
<br>
people would likely end their lives at a finite rate. As long as the 
<br>
birth rate (by any process) minus this rate is less than the increase in 
<br>
available resources over time (for interstellar technospheres it scales 
<br>
quadratically) the amount of resources per person does not run out.
