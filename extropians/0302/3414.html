Anyway, Ron, some may have an inability to see the next enemy, but it would 
<br>
be absolutely incredible if any random nation, e.g. Iceland, was the world's 
<br>
next hot spot.
<br>
<p>Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are on two diffferent pages of the songbook.  You may well be right 
<br>
in a discussion of what experts know.  I recall MacArthur's knowing decades 
<br>
before the 2nd World War that Japan would eventually be an enemy.  But the 
<br>
general population such as those on this list always get surprised.  As the 
<br>
sailor said at Pearl Harbor.  &quot;Who do thoses planes belong to?&quot;  After he was 
<br>
told Japan he said, &quot;Japan? I didn't even know they were mad at us.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a different page of the song book we have often had to tell the 
<br>
international community that we weren't going to be suckered into their 
<br>
treaty machinations.  That is basically President Bush's position on the 
<br>
Kyoto Treaty.
