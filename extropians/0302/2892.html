<em>&gt;Kanan Makiya
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sunday February 16, 2003
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Observer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The United States is on the verge of committing itself to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;post-Saddam plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for a military government in Baghdad with Americans appointed to head Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ministries, and American soldiers to patrol the streets of Iraqi cities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The plan, as dictated to the Iraqi opposition in Ankara last week by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;United States-led delegation, further envisages the appointment by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the US of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an unknown number of Iraqi quislings palatable to the Arab countries of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gulf and Saudi Arabia as a council of advisers to this military government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The plan reverses a decade-long moral and financial commitment by the US to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Iraqi opposition, and is guaranteed to turn that opposition from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;close ally it has always been during the 1990s into an opponent of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;United States on the streets of Baghdad the day after liberation. [etc]
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm, I must be missing something there. The article repeatedly refers to
<br>
&quot;the plan&quot; &quot;the Plan&quot; &quot;the plan&quot; but WHERE on Earth is the plan? It is the
<br>
age of hyperlinks, no? There are several links at the bottom of the page
<br>
referencing other similar articles, and to be fair, I clicked a few. But
<br>
nope, no plan. How unextropic of Kunan Makiya to titillate me with stories
<br>
of a really rotten American plan, and then just leave me hanging without the
<br>
plan. Can you say hyperbole kids? Sure, I knew you could.
<br>
<p>This quote from a the paragraph above is somewhat telling - &quot;as DICTATED (my
<br>
caps) to the Iraqi opposition in Ankara last week&quot;. If I had to guess, and
<br>
it seems I do, I'd guess that this is a case of &quot;sour grapes&quot;. Someone is
<br>
apparently unhappy that the Americans are about to take out Saddam, but NOT
<br>
just hand over Iraq to them on a silver platter the next day. And well they
<br>
shouldn't, if the recipients of the plan lacked the basic administrative
<br>
foresight to bring along a stenographer or even a tape recorder to a meeting
<br>
which officially rolled out the plan.
