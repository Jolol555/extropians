Sure, game theory is often an extreme oversimplification and especially 
<br>
in foras like this we tend to overuse it (I'm certainly guilty of that 
<br>
quite often). But at the other hand it also represents a well-understood 
<br>
formal structure which can derive implications of certain kinds of 
<br>
assumptions effectively; it is a modeling tool. The important thing to 
<br>
remember whenever one is making a model is whether the assumptions are 
<br>
complete enough to both lead to the right behavior and not leave out 
<br>
additional small complications that can change the resulting behavior 
<br>
qualitatively. The model should be as simple as possible, but not 
<br>
simpler.

<p>I seem to recall that a lot of nuclear policy from Rand Corp
<br>
was set using game theory.

<p>Game theory is an useful tool to abstract situations to make them more 
<br>
cognitively manageable. That is extremely important in many 
<br>
military/political situations since (as the debate on this list has 
<br>
shown) people tend to get rather emotional about them.
