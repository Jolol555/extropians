<p>
Normally I use this extropian forum to debate and pontificate about
<br>
those technological subjects about which I feel I have some expertise.
<br>
Suddenly however I find myself feeling helpless and ignorant about an
<br>
important subject: computer keylogging and surveillance software. I'm
<br>
hoping some of the expert hackers here can offer some advice to help me
<br>
with a rather upsetting situation. 
<br>
<p>It appears that my personal home PC has been hacked. Someone unbeknownst
<br>
to me has discovered the password and email address that I once used to
<br>
logon to a particular website. This person then impersonated me on the
<br>
relevant site and used the resulting record of my activity in an effort
<br>
to disrupt my personal life in a very destructive way. I have no
<br>
evidence so far that this person is not also seeking to disrupt my
<br>
financial or professional life. I use pretty much the same email and
<br>
password for everything, though I have already rushed to change the most
<br>
critical passwords in the wake of this incident. 
<br>
<p>My PC is generally not physically accessible to anyone other than
<br>
myself. My first guess therefore is that my security was compromised by
<br>
some kind of remote installation stealth keylogging software capable of
<br>
gathering my password information and transmitting back to the sender
<br>
over the internet. It's my understanding that it is possible to install
<br>
keylogging and screenshot copying software remotely via email
<br>
attachments, attachments which would then, if executed, start sending
<br>
data secretly to the original sender via unseen email. Normally I am
<br>
careful to refrain from opening email attachments from strangers, (I
<br>
know enough to protect myself against common email worms and viruses),
<br>
but in this case there is every reason to believe that the culprit was
<br>
no stranger. The primary suspect in my mind is one of a handful spiteful
<br>
and potentially treacherous ex-girlfriends who may now be trying to
<br>
sabotage my current relationship, and who might also possibly be
<br>
interested in doing financial or professional damage to my life as well.
<br>
<p><p>As the saying goes, &quot;hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.&quot; And I have
<br>
dated some very intelligent and computer savvy women in recent years,
<br>
some of whom might very well be feeling scorned. :/ (In fact the most
<br>
likely culprit knows of my membership here and might very well be
<br>
reading these very words as I write or publish them. If so then so be
<br>
it! She might just as well know right now that I have every intention to
<br>
go after her ass with a vengeance. If possible I will press legal
<br>
charges.)
<br>
<p>I am running Windows XP Home Edition. Until a couple of week ago I was
<br>
connected 24/7 via DSL, but in the last few weeks I have been using
<br>
dialup only. Normally I keep McAfee Firewall running, but I cannot say
<br>
with certainty that I have not manually allowed a suspect program access
<br>
to the internet (that imo is a serious problem with these personal
<br>
firewall programs... It's difficult for regular folks to know a bad
<br>
program from a good one unless the app name is obviously familiar).
<br>
<p>Today, in an effort to find stealth keylogging programs, I installed and
<br>
ran a trial copy of Anti-Keylogger, published by Raytown Corporation.
<br>
Anti-Keylogger identified these files as suspect on my XP system:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;-  c:\windows\system32\wbem\repository\fs\index.btr
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-  c:\windows\system32\wbem\repository\fs\objects.map.new
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-  c:\windows\system32\wbem\repository\fs\index.map.new
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-  c:\windows\system32\wbem\repository\fs\objects.data
<br>
<p>Can anyone tell me if these files are in fact evidence of malicious
<br>
keylogging? Their location under windows/system32 leads me think they
<br>
are innocent.
<br>
<p>Also I installed and ran a trial version of SpyCop version 5.2c. This
<br>
trial version of the software found nothing suspicious, but according to
<br>
the literature the trial software does not check every file. Is this a
<br>
program worth purchasing? If not, what anti-computer surveillance apps
<br>
should I consider? Note that these applications are in a different
<br>
category from anti-virus software. I already run anti-virus software
<br>
from McAffee, along with their firewall and anti-spam software.
<br>
<p>In what other ways might someone gain access to my password and logon
<br>
information to impersonate me at a particular web site, short of having
<br>
physical access to my PC? Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.
<br>
