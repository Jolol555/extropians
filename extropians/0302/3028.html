&quot;What I complain about is when the US goes into a country and props up
<br>
a dictator. Or even worse, when the US overthrows a democratically
<br>
elected government to install a dictator. Sadly, both of these are
<br>
standard events for the US. Consider the following examples:&quot;
<br>
<p><p>&quot;- In 1953 the US helped the Shah of Iran mount a coup against Mohammed
<br>
Mossadegh, the democratically elected prime minister. For the next 27
<br>
years we supported the Shah, a corrupt dictator who stole from and
<br>
oppressed his own people, because he allowed us to use Iran as a base
<br>
for force projection close to the Soviet border. The rise of
<br>
fundamentalist Islam in Iran can be directly traced to our support of
<br>
a regime that repressed the people and left fundamentalist Islamic
<br>
groups as the few willing and able to resist the dictator we'd
<br>
installed.&quot;
<br>
<p>I can just as easily say that the US should be blamed more for NOT 
<br>
maintaining the Shah's Peacock Throne in 1979. Especially when one considers 
<br>
that the abdication of the Shah led to the ceasing of Iran &quot;as a base for 
<br>
force projection close to the Soviet border&quot;. With no more US presence in 
<br>
Iran, this gave the Soviets a free hand in the region and allowed them to 
<br>
proceed with their invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. This led to the 
<br>
US and Chinese needing to support the Mujahadeen to expel the Soviets, which 
<br>
in turn led to the rise of Osama Bin Laden and his cronies. So, to use your 
<br>
logic, the rise of the terrorism that now threatens US and international 
<br>
security can be directly traced to our lack of support of a regime that 
<br>
opposed fundamentalist Islamic groups.
<br>
<p>Not every decision made by the United States during the Cold War was 
<br>
laudable, but effort does need to be made to examine each decision in the 
<br>
international context of the time. Syngman Rhee of South Korea, Nguyen Van 
<br>
Thieu of South Vietnam, and a host of other regimes we kept afloat during the 
<br>
Cold War (or attempted to) were by no means ideal ones, they were just a 
<br>
hundred times better than their Communist (in most cases) alternatives.
<br>
<p>If you are going to lambaste the US for just 'imposing its will' abroad 
<br>
during the Cold War, then it is only fair and appropriate that you outline 
<br>
the record of its adversaries, the Soviet Union and its proxies, the 
<br>
countries who dictated most of the US counter-actions. I mean, are you 
<br>
suggesting that the Sandanistas in Nicaragua were the poster child for 
<br>
positive regimes in the world? Did they not &quot;rape, pillage, etc.., etc…&quot; on 
<br>
grand scales? Where is your criticism (and the necessary perspective that 
<br>
would provide in regard to US actions, good and bad) of these contemporary 
<br>
regimes?
<br>
<p>Getting back to the specific example I chose, it is my feeling that the 
<br>
Carter administration's handling of the Iranian Revolution was particularly 
<br>
disastrous. Especially when it went counter to that of several preceding 
<br>
administrations that had hoped to establish a pro-western bulwark in that 
<br>
region (something we could very much use now) all in the name of a &quot;Human 
<br>
Rights first&quot; doctrine. A doctrine based on the concept of getting past our, 
<br>
in President Carter's words, &quot;inordinate fear of communism&quot;. All this 
<br>
doctrine did do, in fact, was embolden the Soviet Union, do nothing to stop 
<br>
nightmares in Ethiopia and Cambodia, and place an even worse regime in power 
<br>
in Iran.
<br>
<p>Our foreign policy of that era was not based on 'spreading freedom and 
<br>
democracy', it was based on the containment of expansionist Communism which 
<br>
was in our direct national interest (along with the rest of the free world). 
<br>
Freedom and democracy took hold in a number of our proxy states, something 
<br>
that cannot be said for our adversaries in the conflict. The US track record 
<br>
when they remove regimes and rebuild nations is in my view a very good one. 
<br>
Especially when one examines West Germany, Italy, South Korea, Japan, etc…
<br>
Afghanistan is certainly better off under the Karzai regime than Mullah 
<br>
Omar's, and so too will Iraq be better off without Saddam Hussein. Past 
<br>
policy decisions cannot be used to remove the possibility of a particular 
<br>
action today. World dynamics are perpetually changing. We aligned ourselves 
<br>
with the Soviet Union against the Nazis because it was in our national 
<br>
interest to do so, just as subsequently aiding the Mujahadeen in opposing the 
<br>
expansionist Soviet Union was in our national interest. We had absolutely no 
<br>
moral or political connection with either of these entities, but the 
<br>
overriding realpolitik of the day required alliances. 
<br>
<p>If our actions in Iraq are based on &quot;selfish&quot; issues of national interest 
<br>
rather than the &quot;spreading of freedom and democracy&quot; and the end result is 
<br>
still a better quality of life for the Iraqi people, I don't see what the 
<br>
problem is. Altruism didn't motivate our actions in World War II or the Cold 
<br>
War and its many proxies, yet millions nonetheless benefited. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>

<p>&quot;At every turn, we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with

America and little that is right.&quot;
