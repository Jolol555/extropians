<p>
AN OPEN LETTER TO someone with a problem.
<br>
It has come to my attention that someone who is not me has been sending 
<br>
messages to several of the  individuals I talk to, claiming to be me. 
<br>
Since most of those individuals are on these newsgroups, this is the 
<br>
quickest way to let you all know.
<br>
The content of these messages is political and is not very nice and is 
<br>
_not_ my point of view. Some sad soul is trying to set me up with a 
<br>
dodgy reputation.
<br>
Now I'm an open-minded guy, so before I kill them, I would like to give 
<br>
them a chance to explain _why_ they consider these playground tactics 
<br>
necessary. Come out and speak to me, on or offline, and explain why you 
<br>
think I deserve this. I am happy to talk in front of anybody...are you?
<br>
All those who know me are aware that I don't have any political stance; 
<br>
please do not imply otherwise.
<br>
I would like to thank those who drew my attention to this by questioning 
<br>
those emails. Unfortunately, to be absolutely sure it is me personally 
<br>
you are talking to, you'll have to use PGP for private mail until I can 
<br>
sort this out : (
<br>
