<i>&gt;&gt; OK, so "The Original" is just a name, of no greater significance</i><br>
than
<br>
<a href="1706.html#1716qlink1">&gt;&gt; any other name, #87 for example.</a><br>



<p>
<a href="1706.html#1716qlink2">&gt;Its a name that determines your assignment and weather or not you</a><br>
have
<br>
<a href="1706.html#1716qlink3">&gt;been slated for voluntary short term memory suicide in 10 hours.  So</a><br>
<i>&gt;its a little more than just a name.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1720qlink1">I, Mr.87 am slated to die but that fathead Mr. Original is not, he's
going
<br>
on a luxury vacation instead, that's a hell of a difference and if
it's not enough to make the two diverge in a hurry nothing will.</a>  Mr.
<a name="1720qlink2">Original made the assignments and I note he didn't say he and 99
copies
<br>
would blow their brains out and Mr. 87 would be the one to achieve
immortality and live the good life forever, personally I think that
</a>
would be
<br>
a much better plan.

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Me</i><br>
<a href="1706.html#1716qlink4">&gt;&gt; I still don't understand, why should I look at my name tag, other</a><br>
than
<br>
<a href="1706.html#1716qlink5">&gt;&gt; pure curiosity what useful information would I gain by doing so ?</a><br>


<p>
<a name="1720qlink3"><a href="1706.html#1716qlink6">&gt;You are the one that designed the temporary spawning process.</a><br>

<p>
That wasn't me that was Mr. Original and he doesn't know what it's
like to
<br>
face the prospect of immediate death, I do and I don't like it one
</a>
bit.

<p>
<a name="1720qlink4"><i>&gt; Why would you ignore your own intentions.</i><br>

<p>
It doesn't really matter why,</a> the fact is I am ignoring them, so
obviously
<br>
they can no longer be my intentions even if Mr. Original still
thinks it's a wonderful

<p>
<i>&gt;Of course you would look at the name tag, this is part of the plan.</i><br>

<p>
The plan sucks.

<p>
<i>&gt;This is how you know what work you've been assigned and if</i><br>
<a href="1706.html#1716qlink7">&gt;your slated for voluntary short term memory suicide in 10 hours.</a><br>

<p>
Let Mr. original kill himself if he wants but I do NOT volunteer.


<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Me;</i><br>
<a href="1706.html#1716qlink8">&gt;&gt; It wouldn't matter if my tag said "The Original" or "#87",</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'd still rather have the other fellow blow his brains out not me.</i><br>



<p>
<a name="1720qlink5"><a href="1706.html#1716qlink9">&gt;With the exception of 10 hours divergence, the other fellow is you.</a><br>

<p>
Besides that Mrs.. Lincoln how did you like the play.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;none of the copies will deviate from the plan.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1720qlink6">The basic problem is that all the copies are identical yet you're
asking
<br>
them to behave in radically different ways.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;death does not equal 10 hours of amnesia.</i><br>

<p>
Perhaps not because survival is not an all or nothing matter, but it
would
<br>
be close enough to death to make me profoundly unhappy.

<p>
<a name="1720qlink7"><a href="1706.html#1716qlink10">&gt;You've just completed 10 hours of mundane work at the office today in</a><br>
<i>&gt;your normal biological state.  You then documented your work more</i><br>
<i>&gt;thoroughly than ever before.  A doctor shows up and completely</i><br>
<i>&gt;convinces you beyond any shadow of a doubt that he has invented a</i><br>
<i>&gt;flash light type device that can induce a perfect 10 hour amnesia</i><br>
with
<br>
<a href="1706.html#1716qlink11">&gt;no side effects whatsoever.  You are 100% convinced this is safe and</a><br>
<i>&gt;effective.  He offers you $10,000 to let him use the device on you.</i><br>


<p>
<a name="1919qlink2">As you say it's a judgment call but I'd tell him no way.</a></a>


<p>
<a name="1720qlink8"><a href="1706.html#1716qlink12">&gt;P.S.  Has anyone on this list verified the signature on the message</a><br>
<i>&gt;where John Clark changed his public key?  After more than three years</i><br>
<i>&gt;of reading his post with mostly just minor disagreements, all of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;sudden, one week after changing his public key this major</i><br>
disagreement
<br>
<i>&gt;about the fundamentals of identity pops up.</i><br>

<p>
Nobody can claim absolute consistency so perhaps something I said in
my most
<br>
recent post contradicts something I said in an older one , I don't
know what
</a>
<br>
it could be but I'd love to find out, please illuminate me.


<p>
<a href="1715.html#1716qlink13">&gt;Even if it [My key] verifies correctly, I would still suspect the</a><br>
possibility
<br>
<i>&gt; that he sold his reputation by means of selling his private key.</i><br>

<p>
If I bought John Clark's key then the person you're talking to now is
not
<br>
the same person that has been on the Extropian and Transhuman list for
years, but if I bought it then why am I using a different key?
Actually I
<br>
would have sold out years ago except that nobody made me an offer.

<p>
My Old Public key signed with my Old Secret Key and then signed with
my New
<br>
Secret Key.
