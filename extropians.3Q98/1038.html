<a href="1001.html#1038qlink3">&gt;&gt;This FAQ has left out many areas of Transhumanism, although the points you</a><br>

Hi Natasha,

<p>
The FAQ is intended as a work in progress and a repository of group memory I
suppose.  I did not propose any of the questions on the FAQs except the
first one re: Futurism and Transhumanism (as a segue). I just answered the
FAQs that Nick Bostrom proposed on the Transhuman Digest and added other
FAQs I noticed from others on the Transhumanist and Extropian Digests (while
trying to credit and link sources for dialogue).  I would be **GREATLY**
interested in any other questions and responses that you would like to add
to the FAQs.  I am aware that my knowledge of Transhumanist History and Art
is minimal in particular.  I am reading up on these things especially lately
with Third Culture and now Last Flesh later maybe Selfish Gene and Infinite
in All Directions or Physics of Immortality.  (What are your suggestions?)
What I've read lately is at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9356/WebRecommendations.htm">http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9356/WebRecommendations.htm</a>.

<p>
<a href="1001.html#1038qlink4">&gt;&gt;And, as an aside, would you be kind enough to use "human" rather than</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"man."</i><br>
<hr>
<br>
I think that I usually do (especially in the last "taxonomic speculation"
question).  I'll try to keep that in mind though.

<p>
P.S. I read about the Second Edition of Create/Recreate from you in one of
the 2 lists above.  How is that coming?  I'm interested in a copy.  (In a
letter with the book you mentioned half price for those who bought the First
Edition.)

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Best,</i><br>
