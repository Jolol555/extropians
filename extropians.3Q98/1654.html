No one of them can tell this with certainty.  That is why I wrote that
they could conclude that they were "probably" near the end.

<p>
Consider a lottery where only a few players win out of millions of
participants.  No particular lottery player has any way of telling, a
priori, whether he would be right or wrong in believing that his ticket
probably won't win.  But he can conclude based on what he knows about
the lottery that it is very likely to be the case that he won't win.

<p>
The Tamagotchis are in a similar situation.  Knowing only their birth
ordering and a general model of exponential growth, they can conclude
that they are probably near the end of the fad.  Some of them won't be
near the end, just as some lottery players actually win.  But that does
not imply the falsehood of the probabilistic conclusion.
