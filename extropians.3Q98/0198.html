I further predict that I'm correct so you'll never find a counterexample to 
prove me wrong, but I predict I can't prove I'm right either because a proof 
that I'm correct, that is, a way to demonstrate it in a finite number of 
steps, does not exist. Not that I can prove any of this of course.

Great! Even though I'm the one who used the term so I'm sure it has profound 
significance, I really wish somebody would explain it to me because I haven't 
a clue.

Yes, if something is able to act in a complex way similar to the way I do 
then it's mental content must be similar to me.

If so then religious people are right, the soul exists. I think that is, to 
put it politely, unlikely.

<p>
I think other people are conscious, at least part of the time, because they 
act that way, but not when they're in a deep sleep or a coma or dead. To put 
it another way, I assume something is conscious if it act intelligently. I 
admit that all this is just an assumption but we'll never get anything better.

I think I know approximately what you mean but I'll never know for certain if

I assume that lightning and trees and rocks are not conscious because they 
don't act intelligently but I'll never know for certain if I'm correct. It's  
not a perfect rule of thumb but I couldn't live my life any other way and 
there is no hope of finding anything better.

Let's see, I know other people are conscious because they use language and I 
can tell it's a language because the people are conscious. What's wrong with 
this picture?

         &gt;&gt;no two lightning bolts on planet earth have ever been identical,         
         &gt;&gt;and no two target trees for them to hit either. 

         &gt;Assume that it does.  

</pre>
<p>
Ok, I have no trouble imagining a hypothetical world where everything is 
different and where lightning is a language, we just don't happen to live in  
such a world.

<p>
A letter mean nothing, it's only when they're combined into words do they  
become symbols related to something concrete. In the case of the genetic code 
3 letters symbolize an amino acid, lightning has no words and so symbolizes  
nothing.

There is no "if" about it, that's the way the genetic code works.

         &gt;&gt;in what way would the ribosome act differently if CAU did mean         
         &gt;&gt;something to it? 

         &gt;It wouldn't, necessarily.
          

</pre>
<p>
Apparently you don't realize it but by making this huge concession you've 
thrown in the towel. If meaning doesn't change anything, then there is no  
point in talking about it. If you're right then I'd have no way of showing  
that language exists, not ever. You expressed incredulity that someone could  
believe that another human being is not conscious but now you say that
behavior is no guide to the mental state of anything. If as you say behavior 
is no indicator of sentience then I have absolutely no reason to think that 
words mean anything to you or that you're more conscious than the average 
rock.

<p>
One other thing,<a name="0454qlink2"> although our internal mental states and emotions may be 
priceless to us they are of interest to evolution only as they effect 
behavior, and if they don't then there is no way random mutation and natural 
selection could have produced it for us to enjoy. Yet we have</a> it, or at least 
I do.

<p>
The logic is impeccable and the conclusion absurd, therefore the premise must 
be wrong, we CAN deduce meaning from behavior and it something starts to 
attach meaning to a great many things, much, much, more than the 64 simple  
triplets that ribosomes can handle, then we can begin to start calling  
something like that conscious.
