<p>
I think there are limits, although not necessarily sharp ones.  I cannot
be uncertain about what century I was born in, not if I have enough of
my memories to even be able to know what happened in various centuries.

<a name="1677qlink1">For one thing, I have memories of 20th century events, so I cannot have
been born earlier than the 20th century.</a>  I have no memories whatsoever
about 21st century events, so assuming that the only thing erased from
my memory was my birth date, then I must have been born in the 20th
century.

<p>
Similarly I have no personal memories of events from before the decade I
was born, but I do have personal memories of events from that decade and
later ones.  Of course my younger memories are hazier and less certain,
but I should be able to narrow down my date of birth to within about a
five to ten year period just based on what I remember experiencing.

<p>
This amount of uncertainty is not enough to drive the DA assumption that
I might have been born at any time in human history.<a name="1677qlink2">  I am a product of
my times in a very fundamental way.  I would be a very different person
if I were born in the 17th or 23rd centuries.
