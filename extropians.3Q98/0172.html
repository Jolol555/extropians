<a href="0068.html#0172qlink1">&gt;How would  such a robot react if required to save  2 very young children</a><br>
whose lives were in mortal danger( say they have fallen out of a window),
where the circumstances were such that only one child's life could be saved
by the robot.  Lets also assume the children were twins and that there was
no reason to favour one over the other, or that there were no other
characteristics known to the Robot that would allow it  to determine which
life would, potentially, be that most likely to be of most benefit to
<br>
<a href="0068.html#0172qlink2">&gt;humanity in the long run.  Could that not immobilize our robot ?</a><br>

<p>
No. Not acting results in 2 dead, picking one, by any criteria, results in
1 dead. Picking the nearest, or the one on the left would do.

<p>
Try again!
