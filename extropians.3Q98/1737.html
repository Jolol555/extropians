<p>
<a name="1753qlink2">An AC standard makes most semse for a distribution system. In the 
future, the present copper webworks may not exist, and be replaced 
with small generators or fuel cells at the point of use.</a> Here in 
Illinois, Commonwealth Edison is planning on selling small naturalgas
 powered turbogenerators to consumers who then make their own 
power, free of the grid. The generators will produce 60 Hz AC because 
all our systems expect it now.

<p>
For machinery, 3-phase AC is king, as the induction motor requires 
it, sepecially in the larger horsepower ranges. Advances in power 
inverters may make this obsolete, as the required AC can be created 
from DC if needed.

<p>
<a name="1741qlink2">AC has one big advantage over DC - the voltage can be simply raised 
and lowered with transformers to allow transmission of power over 
long distances. There have been a (very) few high voltage DC 
transmission lines - the one I remember most is a coaxial cable from 
England to France that transfers power from whoever has the surplus 
to who needs it. There's a bidirectional HV inverter on each end of 
the cable to connect to that countries' AC grid.</a>

<p>
<a name="1741qlink3">If fuel cells or some breakthrough in home nuclear power becomes 
popular, the generator will probably produce DC. In this case, a 
local inverter can make AC for motors, etc. Lighting can work as 
efficiently from either DC or AC.</a>

<p>
A 24 V DC system would be OK for small loads, but you need heavy 
wires to conduct the current required for big loads, one reason that 
440 V 3-phase is so popular in industry - the wiring is much cheaper 
than if a lower voltage was used.
