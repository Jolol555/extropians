This is an extremely good and valid idea.
however, the practicalities of communicating effectively over
intercontinental distances make such a network reasonably
expensive, and also, if the balloon really DOES go up, you'd want
to be careful that you aren't targetted by surviving military
elements zeroing in on your signals.</a>

Well, this is also a practical idea. But you're advocating a
survivalist, apocalyptic group, with all that entails.</a>

Isn't this a private list?</a> It's not a newsgroup. I'm not a member
