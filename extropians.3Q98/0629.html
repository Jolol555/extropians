Reasonably... i.e. about as good as any other international comparisons.
There's always an incentive to record suicides as accidents, and evidence
that a fair number of supposed gun accidents in America were really 
suicides; but even then there are comparitively so few reported gun 
accidents that adding them all to the suicide rate wouldn't affect it 
that much.

<p>
There are also other oddities, such as Japan where there's evidence of
many family murders (e.g. parents killing children then themselves)
being classified as suicides.

<p>
But it's not likely to affect the figures that much either way.
