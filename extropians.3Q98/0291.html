Right, I was referring to velocity, not acceleration.  The point is,
the amount of power it takes for you to feel 1 g of acceleration is
independent of your velocity, simply because there is no such thing as
(absolute) velocity.  We can conclude immediately that a fast-moving
spaceship will not notice anything impeding its efforts to accelerate
at 1 g, because otherwise this would imply that the laws of physics
are somehow different for fast moving and slow moving objects, and the
principle of relativity forbids this.

<p>
(The principle of relativity is different from the theory of relativity:
the former merely says that you can't tell how fast you are going, while
the latter develops all the ramifications of this.)

This "rotation" is an optical illusion, not a real effect.  It is true
that you can see the back side of objects, but that is because of the way
the light rays travel to your eyes.  The objects are not really rotated,
if you take what you see and calculate the light travel time back to when
it was emitted.  Likewise the "starbow" and aberration effects which make
it look like the universe is compressed forward of you are illusions,
as is the appearance that the universe is evolving quickly ahead of you
and freezes into immobility as it passes.
