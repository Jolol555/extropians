My experience online seems to suggest that americans tend to
react to disagreement far more aggressively than europeans. Media
portrayal tends to support this. Maybe americans overreact in
arguments to such an extent that people get violent?

<p>
Note that this is based on the interactions I have had online. I
haven't been to the US, although a friend has just moved to
Boston from Melbourne and he said that americans seem to be
"drama queens" compared to what he is used to here, in other
words they dramatically overreact in a given situation. This was
his response when I asked him if there was much difference
between Melbourne and Boston, so it seems to be what struck him
as the most obvious difference. He's been in Boston for about 18
months now.

It was addressed to Michael Lorry, who made that dodgy comment.
