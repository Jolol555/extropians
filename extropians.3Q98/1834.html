Yes, but that's not what you're doing here. You're taking a hundred copies
of someone, waiting for ten hours and then deleting them. Their minds are
*not* preserved. They are dead. 

<p>

<p>
Yes. So why don't you?

Well thanks.

<a name="1846qlink2"><a href="1813.html#1834qlink5">&gt;Mark, I appreciate and empathize with your comments.  However, in so</a><br>

<p>
Look, your definition of identity is fundamentally flawed,</a> and no amount
<a name="1846qlink3">of technology will change that. A copy is only a duplicate of you at
precisely the instant it's copied, and immediately begins</a> to diverge. If
<a name="1846qlink4">the copy is destroyed at that point it's dead.</a> 

<p>
<a name="1846qlink5">Let's give a better example than yours. Suppose you decide that the
weather is too nice to work, so you create a copy and send it to the
beach; you'll go to work and then kill yourself, so the copy will take
your place the next day. 

<p>
Will you kill yourself at the end of the day? This example</a> is precisely
<a name="1846qlink6">equivalent to yours except that you get to kill yourself,</a> you don't get to
<a name="1846qlink7">claim without evidence that your copies will do so.</a> 

<p>
Are you really that suicidal?
