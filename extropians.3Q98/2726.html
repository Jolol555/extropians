Yes, but that's like criticizing Leibniz for not also being Lagrange.
Shakespeare is not the last word in English literature, but he is arguably
the first.  Shakespeare is Vonnegut's foundation.  I assure you just about
any "original" plot you try to create, unless you take the modernist
approach of eschewing plot altogether, has already been done before, by
Shakespeare.  Why reinvent the wheel?

Philosophy, however, is a different matter; in this case, I must agree with
<a name="2742qlink1">you that there's very little in ancient or even more recent philosophy that
can be salvaged...</a> except to the extent that we argue that science is the
philosophy of prediction.
