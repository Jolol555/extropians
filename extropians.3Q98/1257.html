Abstract
<br>
  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a nutritional supplement of
  selenium will decrease the incidence of cancer. DESIGN: A
  multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cancer prevention
  trial. SETTING: Seven dermatology clinics in the eastern United States.
  PATIENTS: A total of 1312 patients (mean age, 63 years; range, 18-80 years)
  with a history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin were
  randomized from 1983 through 1991. Patients were treated for a mean (SD) of
  4.5 (2.8) years and had a total follow-up of 6.4 (2.0) years. INTERVENTIONS:
  Oral administration of 200 microg of selenium per day or
  placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end points for the trial were the
  incidences of basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. The secondary
  end points, established in 1990, were all-cause mortality and total cancer
  mortality, total cancer incidence, and the incidences of lung, prostate, and
  colorectal cancers. RESULTS: After a total follow-up of 8271 person-years,
  selenium treatment did not significantly affect the
  incidence of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer. There were 377 new
  cases of basal cell skin cancer among patients in the
  selenium group and 350 cases among the control group
  (relative risk [RR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.28), and 218
  new squamous cell skin cancers in the selenium group and 190
  cases among the controls (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93-1.39). Analysis of secondary
  end points revealed that, compared with controls, patients treated with
  selenium had a nonsignificant reduction in all-cause
  mortality (108 deaths in the selenium group and 129 deaths
  in the control group [RR; 0.83; 95% CI, 0.63-1.08]) and significant
  reductions in total cancer mortality (29 deaths in the
  selenium treatment group and 57 deaths in controls [RR,
  0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.80]), total cancer incidence (77 cancers in the
  selenium group and 119 in controls [RR, 0.63; 95% CI,
  0.47-0.85]), and incidences of lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers.
  Primarily because of the apparent reductions in total cancer mortality and
  total cancer incidence in the selenium group, the blinded
  phase of the trial was stopped early. No cases of selenium
  toxicity occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Selenium treatment did not
  protect against development of basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.
  However, results from secondary end-point analyses support the hypothesis
  that supplemental selenium may reduce the incidence of, and
  mortality from, carcinomas of several sites. These effects of
  selenium require confirmation in an independent trial of
  appropriate design before new public health recommendations regarding
  selenium supplementation can be made
