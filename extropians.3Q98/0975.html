And now it's mice. In today's issue of Nature there is an article by 
Yanagimachi and Wakayama, they report they've cloned 22 mice. Since the paper 
was written they have gone on to clone over 50 mice including a clone of a 
clone of a clone. To my mind that pretty much settles the matter, cloning 
does reset the cellular aging clock.

<p>
Back when Dolly was cloned it was said by many that sheep were especially 
easy to clone because when their eggs are fertilized they develop very slowly, 
humans eggs develop faster so you would have little time to work with them 
and it would be much more difficult to clone, and mice  eggs develop much 
faster than even human eggs so mice would be virtually  impossible to clone.
At least that's what they said.

<p>
One interesting sidelight, they wrote their article on Oct 5 of last year  
(they had only cloned 4 mice then) and submitted it to the journal "Science",  
they sat on the article for a few months and then rejected it, not because 
they thought it was inaccurate but because it was "not of general interest".  
At least that's what they said. 

<p>
I fear Science magazine is becoming politically correct, even the people at 
Nature dragged their feet for months. On the plus side The New York Times 
says because of these results venture capitalists are starting a animal 
cloning company.
