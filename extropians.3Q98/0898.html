Unless a neuron has a soul it can be simulated. One neuron sees another  
neuron as a black box, it doesn't matter how it does what it does as long as 
it gets the job done.

I don't see the slightest reason why norepinephrine or any other 
neurotransmitter would be especially difficult to simulate, because chemical  
messengers are not a sign of sophisticated design on nature's part, rather 
it's an example of Evolution's bungling. If you need to inhibit a nearby  
neuron there are better ways of sending that signal then launching a GABA 
molecule like a message in a bottle thrown into the sea and waiting ages for  
it to diffuse to it's random target.
  
<p>
<a name="0934qlink2">I'm not interested in chemicals only the information they contain,</a> I want the  
information to get transmitted from cell to cell by best method and few would  
send smoke signals if they had a fiber optic cable. The information content 
in each molecular message must be tiny, just a few bits because only about 60 
neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine and GABA are known,  
even if the true number is 100 times greater (or a million times for that 
matter) the information content of each signal must be minute. Also, for the 
long range stuff, exactly which neuron receives the signal can not be 
specified because it relies on a random process, diffusion. The fact that 
it's slow as molasses  in February does not add to
its charm.                                         
   
<p>
If your job is delivering packages and all the packages are very small and  
your boss doesn't care who you give them to as long as it's on the correct  
continent and you have until the next ice age to get the work done, then you  
don't have a very difficult profession. I see no reason why simulating that 
anachronism  would present the slightest difficulty. Artificial neurons could  
be made to release neurotransmitters as inefficiently as natural ones if  
anybody really wanted to, but it would be pointless when there are much  
faster ways.
  
<p>
Electronics is inherently fast because its electrical signals are sent by 
fast light electrons. The brain also uses some electrical signals, but it 
doesn't use electrons, it uses ions to send signals, the most important are 
chlorine and potassium. A chlorine ion is 65 thousand times as heavy as an 
electron, a potassium ion is even heavier, if you want to talk about gap
junctions, the ions they use are millions of times more massive than 
electrons. There is no way to get around it, according to the fundamental laws 
of physics, something that has a large mass will be slow, very, very, slow. 

<p>
The great strength biology has over present day electronics is in the ability 
of one neuron to make thousands of connections of various strengths with 
other neurons. However, I see absolutely nothing in the fundamental laws of 
physics that prevents nano machines from doing the same thing, or better and 
MUCH faster.
