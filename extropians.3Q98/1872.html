I'd extend that to include the honest contemplative's or mystic's experience as well. By applying
scientific method to meditation, everyone who decides to look through this device (call it
experimental cognition) can see what would otherwise remain unseen. Part of the conflict between
science and religion comes from new methods versus old methods, but it also involves habits of
thought and differences in relying on authority.

<p>
Religionists may honestly believe in the dogma they have learned, just as anyone may delude themself
according to their preferences. Science changes as new evidence emerges, whereas belief systems
change in order to avoid appearing irrelevant and out-dated.

<p>
What makes science science? In a word: verification. Without verification via experiment and
observation, it remains theory.
