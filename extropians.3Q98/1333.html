I agree some of the comments on this list have been a bit silly lately.
But buried beneath the dross there are some legitimate questions about M-F
psychology.

<p>
I remember reading somewhere that a survey of libertarians found most of
them are INTJ or INTP
<br>
(I'm INTP myself). It seems evident to me that as rare as these 2 types are
in the general
<br>
population they are rarer still among the female population and if there is
correlation between holding
<br>
libertarian ideas and holding extropian ideas. ...

<p>
Women are probably more likely to be extroverted than men (evolution seems
to have predisposed
<br>
women to be more 'social beings' hence the predilection for 'gossip' - I am
not being
<br>
derogatory about this- 'gossip' obviously served a useful function in the
sexual division of labour
<br>
in primeval times)
<br>
Women are probably more likely to be feelers than thinkers (again I am not
saying one is
<br>
superior to the other - it takes complementary strategies to propagate the
species)
<br>
Women are probably more level-headed than men ( S over N), less likely to be
convinced by solely abstract demonstrations of truth and falsity- hence the
dominance of men
<br>
in professions like maths and physics.
<br>
Of course, there are also those correlations between math/physics ability
and gender.
<br>
Obviously all these traits also correlate negatively with people who are
more likely to be
<br>
extropians or intellectual activists in general
(think - how typical was Ayn Rand of the average female- the exception
that proves the rule),

<p>
Once again let me emphasise I am not trying to spread sexist innuendo here.
Anyone who
<br>
thinks I am is himself/herself guilty of thinking that 'feminine' qualities
are inferior to or less
<br>
important than masculine qualities.
