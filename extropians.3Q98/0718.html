I think this needlessly focuses on one not terribly typical scenario.
<a name="0739qlink1">The earliest uploads will likely be cryonics patients, without much 
hope of getting a regular body anytime soon.</a>  When uploading tech is 
mature, making an upload copy of a flesh brain probably *won't* require
destroying that flesh brain.  And making a copy of an upload brain 
probably will never require destroying the original (though that may
be cheaper sometimes).  It's only in the early but not earliest upload 
tech era regarding meat to metal transitions when the issue might even 
arise.  

<p>
<a href="0712.html#0718qlink2">&gt;We need to know if uploading as described will make us live forever, or</a><br>
<i>&gt;instantly kill us for trying.  This is more than a vague philosophical</i><br>
<i>&gt;question of "if I changed, am I really me". ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think you are looking at copies as if they are offspring.  In such a</i><br>
<i>&gt;scenario, I agree that it is unnecessary to discuss how much like us the</i><br>
<i>&gt;offspring will be.</i><br>

<p>
I mainly want to point out that not only is there a lot of slop in 
deciding "is it a change me or a similar someone else", but even when you
decide "someone else", you may still be willing to sacrifice a lot to 
create that someone else.  Maybe even "die".  When uploading is possible, 
many people *will* do it.  Can't we get past this endless agonizing over 
who will do it, and wonder what their world will be like?
