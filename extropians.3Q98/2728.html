<p>
wow!  this was a  very thought provoking post .  thanks!

<p>
mr. yudkowsky, you may relate to this story.  when i was in college, my
modern physics professor often referred to hofstadter's escher godel
bach, an eternal golden braid.  being a busy engineering student, i did
not look up the reference at the time, but a year after graduating, i found
a copy and started reading.  it absolutely floored me.  i was so freemed,
i immediately read it again straight thru.  i later decided that of all the books
i have ever read, this one had the biggest impact on me.

<p>
<a name="2741qlink1"><a name="2731qlink2">recently i wondered about setting up a website where people could
post an answer to the question: "if one book, which, and why?"</a>

<p>
i would allow people to interpret the question however they liked,
then answer it.  as i looked into what would be required, it occurred
to me that someone else might have already thought of this, so i
did some surfing and sure enough, such a site already exists.  so,
i looked it over.  out of curiousity, i checked to see if anyone else
had picked hofstadter's escher godel bach, an eternal golden braid.

<p>
i found one person had picked egb.  it was the person who
had authored the website!  {8^D
