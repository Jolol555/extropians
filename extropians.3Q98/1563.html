<a name="1581qlink1"><a name="1569qlink1"><a name="1566qlink1">I am new to this Extropy stuff.

<p>
I am a youngish : ) woman who is searching for an</a> organization 
aiming to make a difference. Somebody told me about Extropy 
and I agreed that Extropy appears to really care. We need a world
like Linux : - ) Authentic</a> !

<p>
Is Max More for real ?
<br>
Max More you sound too good to be true !
</a>

<p>
<a name="1566qlink2">Constant self improvement. Both moral and intellectual.
Jesus, fantastic forward thinking Max. What are your plans Max 
for constant moral and ethical self improvement ? I am very 
interested in your master plan. You appear to give a damn about
helping people. That is indeed rare. Everyone at Extropy must 
have the highest moral standards.

<p>
I bet you already have a long list of accomplishments. I would very 
much like to hear about them. Recently gave a couple of hundred
grand from my semi work to rights groups. Felt good. Almost dirty.
Everyone at Extropy must look to your list of achievements and
think, if Max can do it, I can do it ! I am already inspired. Can you
please show me the url to this list. I want to follow your example.
I bet that page gets a lot of hits from the Extropians.

<p>
I bet everyone at Extropy thinks they are on to something good. 
Extropy appears to be a wonderful, friendly, democratic,
understanding place.</a> I bet the Extropians are a diverse set of people.

<p>
<a name="1567qlink1"><a name="1566qlink3">I hope Extropy isn't too sicky sweet like a honey pot</a></a> !

<p>
<a name="1566qlink4">What are Extropian plans for making society work in a post-human world ? 

<p>
How would a possible Extropian society work ? 

<p>
We live in a very Darwinian society here in the U.S. I would very 
much like to hear how people will be made more equal and how 
a better more moral world can be created.</a> I bet all the Extropians
<a name="1566qlink5">are involved with Animal Rights. Are you ? I am a vegetarian.
I think that is highly Extropic ! Killing animals is highly Entropic.</a>

<p>
<a name="1566qlink6">Extropians want to increase Diversity</a> ! 

<p>
<a name="1566qlink7">Extropians want more Democracy</a> !

<p>
<a name="1566qlink8">Who is vice president at Extropy and when is the next election ?

<p>
People helping people. I love it !

<p>
Super advanced technology is going to make the world good.</a> 
<a name="1566qlink9">Everyone is going to be equal</a> !

<p>
<a name="1566qlink10">There are too many hateful people in this country who want to 
stop diversity. Last week a woman from my office was fired 
because she was black. In this day and age. No one told her that
though. They made out she wasn't doing enough work. Shocking 
I know. That boss has a bed sheet in his draw. Very entropic.</a>

<p>
<a name="1566qlink11">What is the Extropian plan to stop only the elite getting new 
technologies ? We have a terrible problem with this in the U.S.
I am white and female and money is no problem but if you fall 
outside that well you're in trouble. I work in the computer industry. 
Advanced lithography at a semi company is my work. Very few
women in the semi industry.

<p>
What is Extropy doing to address the dark side of these new
technologies ? I bet you are all aware of the issues and are 
working to make sure those kind of situations do not happen.
You Max must already be leading the project team with the
objective of sharing the wealth. What is the name of this
project team</a> ?



<p>
I love this group. I already love it. I have a feeling that we are
all going to have a great time together. Where have you been
all my life Max ?

<p>
There needs to be more freedom. I love smoking pot and I 
take just a little bit of coke every blue moon. I am not a junkie. 
My habit is completely under control. Work pays well and I 
like to let my hair down when life gets me down.

<p>
In the U.S we have too many laws.
<br>
Removal of drug laws makes sense to me.

<p>
What will be the Extropian Laws against killing ? 
How will they work exactly ?


<p>
How will people be punished ? 

<p>
How will this wonderful new world work ?

<p>
Max you are one smart cookie. Love this Extropy stuff. Love it. 
Thought all the good people had left after the sixties. Max More it's
your creation so what's the plan ? I want to spread the word. 
Extropy must be working on many programs to sponsor tolerance 
and diversity. What are they called ? Very interested. What are the
names and what do they do ? I want to get involved as soon
as possible.

<p>
<a name="1567qlink2">The Extropian Principals are confusing. 

<p>
</a>Why all the words ? 

<p>
They read as if you were trying to obfuscate rather than
enlighten. You will have to clear this up if you want people 
to understand the principles. 

<p>
<a name="1567qlink3">Extropians must give a lot of money to charity. Which 
chartities do you all sponsor ? Which are on the recommended
list for sponsorship.</a> I would like to write a cheque to help you 
in your quest. I have millions from my stock options. I also know 
people who are very receptive to these ideas. They are even richer 
than me. People from my semi work have hundreds of millions. 
It is strange that people have not already heard of all the good 
work you are doing. You need more PR. People need to see
the good your all doing.

<p>
What is the name of the "Gay and Lesbian" group that you
are affiliated with ? Extropy makes so much sense. Even this
lack luster part of the world has been included. Jesus Christ
Max you are really onto something here. What is the name ? I
would like to write a cheque. Sponsoring one of these groups
would increase Extropy enormously. The world would instantly
become more Diverse hence increasing Extropy. 

<p>
Many "Gay and Lesbians" are very

<p>
Energetic
<br>
Intelligent
<br>
Vital
<br>
Need New Experiences
<br>
Need Opportunity
<br>
Need Growth

<p>
They are all very Extropian !
<br>
In fact I think they would be the ideal Extropian's !  

<p>
You must all be actively involved with the project to
stop genetic termination of homosexuality ? I think that
is taking genetics too far. Remember the story of Alan Turing.

<p>
That would be insanely Entropic.
<br>
That would reduce Extropy completely.

<p>
What is the affiliation please ? 
 

<p>
<a name="1567qlink4">Which other rights groups is Extropy connected with. Black,
women, poor, disadvantaged. I know what Extropy is all
about and I love</a> it.  

<p>
I would also love to hear about all the work Extropians 
on this list are doing to help people out and to make the
world a better place.

<p>
Is anyone here involved with computers for schools ? I
recently organized a group which gave a couple of million 
to that program. I think its important to make sure everyone
keeps up. We don't want people falling behind do we Max.
The American School System is a disaster area.

<p>
This quest of Extropian self improvement must be paying
mighty dividends already. 

<p>
Anyone ? 

<p>
I would love to hear your moral improvement plans and what you
have already accomplished. All of the major ethics groups must
already be well aware of all the wonderful Extropian achievements !

<p>
I would love to tell them what you have all been up to.

<p>
Max ? 

<p>
: )

<p>
Your Pal

<p>
