<i>&gt; species with good PR, (asia, pandas) I'll get the same general result</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a different set of americans.</i><br>

Well, this is true, but  my point was that there is an awful lot
that humans do to apes which is most definately not simply
ignoring them, namely experimenting on them and chopping down
their habitat. Your point on the PR value of animals is entirely
true, but the experimentation issue is something most people
don't consider.
 
<p>
<a href="0321.html#0590qlink2">&gt; Before you disagree, ask yourself how you feel. I'm not picking on Scott</a><br>
<i>&gt; or Dwayne: everyone can play. To the extent that you worry about loss</i><br>
<i>&gt; of habitat for apes, you are severely restricting the options for some</i><br>
<i>&gt; fairly poor and desperate african tribespeople, some of whom could sell</i><br>
<i>&gt; ape's feet, rhino horns, or elephant tusks to buy food and medicine to</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep their kids alive.</i><br>

<p>
There are lots of people. There aren't lots of apes.
 
<p>
<a href="0321.html#0590qlink3">&gt; I personally take a view that is fairly callous and cruel: human</a><br>
<i>&gt; overpopulation will inevitably destroy all ecosystems if allowed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; do so. Therefore, restricting human over-exploitation of ecosystems</i><br>
<i>&gt; at worst merely slightly advances a restriction that would eventually</i><br>
<i>&gt; occur anyway. To the extent that this generates economic hardship that</i><br>
<i>&gt; results in excess human death, I'm an evil person.</i><br>

<p>
Well, I'm with you on this one.
