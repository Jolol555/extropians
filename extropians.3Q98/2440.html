The Human Memeome Project,

<p>
<a name="2457qlink1"><a name="2447qlink1">This might be a good place to start for memetic engineers.  Use data
mining on the net to gather replicating ideas and identify allies. 
Without AI, a lot of the meme pool would be missed, but maybe a lot of
them could be found with simple algorithms.  Who knows until you try
it.  It's not like were trying to capture all ideas ever born, just
those that are currently replicating.

<p>
The biggest problem is excluding the right sites in order to make "The
Net Memeome Project" representative of "The Human Memeome Project".  I
would start with excluding commercial and most adult sites.</a>

<p>
<a name="2447qlink2">The more I think about it, the more I think this is a pretty far
fetched idea (I'm good at those).  At the same time, I think the right
person could do something useful</a> with it.
