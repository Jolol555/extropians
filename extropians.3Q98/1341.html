<a name="1347qlink1">Some comments = Summary opinion is the 'exhibition' is heavy on eye 
candy and light on content. I'm a graphic artist with a computer gaming 
company and I fancy myself a transhumanists too so I can comment on both 
sides of the coin.</a>

<a name="1347qlink2"><i>&gt;From an technical art standpoint there was nothing there that you cant </i><br>
find in an AOL graphics forum. No epiphany engines. The rendering work 
was mediocre. It was good for an amateur. Im assuming Sandberg is not a 
formally trained graphic artist. Several illumination problems, 
questionable material and vector calls. But nothing requiring 
</a>crucifixion. :-)

<p>
<a name="1347qlink3">I havent figured out the whole 'transhuman art' concept yet so its hard 
for me to judge whether Sandberg succeeded. I doubt anything I saw would 
inspire someone to change their views about transhumanism. Then again 
you can say that about everything Ive seen that is called transhuman or 
extropian art.  Anyway.....</a>
