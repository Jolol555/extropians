<a name="2147qlink1">Ken's sadly humorous rant about the bureaucratic nightmare of getting a
fictitious business name reflects some recent experience I had with Texas'
drivers' license</a> authority, the Department of Public Safety (a name with
chilling parallels to the Committee for Public Safety in the French
Revolution).  After wasting many hours to conclude the nine minute transaction
of renewing my driver's license, I could only conclude that such galling
inefficiency was the result of monopoly power.  In the case of the DPS, it's
ARMED monopoly power.  

<p>
I asked the woman who finally did accept the paper work for my license whether
the half-day I wasted at the DPS office was typical.  I was informed that, no,
it was actually a "light" day.  Most days were worse.  I asked her whether
other people had ever made the observation that the office's procedures seemed
inefficient.  She responded that yes, it was a common observation but "What
people don't understand is that driving is a privilege, not a right."

<p>
Rather than continue the dialogue,<a name="2147qlink2"> I counted myself lucky to have gotten
<a name="2156qlink1">through the ordeal and left, more confirmed than ever in my opinion that a
little competition would be a good tonic to most ills of government
inefficiency.</a></a>
