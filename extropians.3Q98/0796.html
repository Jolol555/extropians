<p>
Who among us wants life to end?  Perhaps the suicidal because they suffer
from acute depression, and perhaps the elderly or diseased because their
bodies have become overly burdensome, and perhaps those who die attempting
to save the lives of others.  But what if you didn't grow old, and what if
depression was easily treatable?  As long as life continued to give you
pleasure, what reason could you ever give for choosing to end it?  Our most
intense emotions are associated with our fear of death and our grief over
the deaths of others.  The most natural and powerful of all motivations is
the motivation to live.

<p>
Consider also that by the time you get really good at your chosen
profession, learn how to love and to be loved, and develop wisdom, patience,
and tolerance, you've got maybe twenty years to take advantage of it before
you become too old and have to retire.  Meanwhile, you've passed on only a
small fraction of the information you spent a lifetime accruing to the next
generation who must retrace your steps all over again.  This is a terribly
inefficient and tragically wasteful system.

<p>
We have done very well for ourselves tampering with nature so far (e.g.
medicine, heating &amp; air-conditioning, books).

<a href="0772.html#0796qlink3">&gt; Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?</a><br>


<p>
The extropian ideal is to become more than human, to enhance those qualities
than make us human.  Becoming inhuman is just the opposite, becoming less
than human.
