You're thinking of the Swiss. I think.

<p>
I don't recall there being militias of the Swiss type in Denmark. I 
wouldn't be surprised if there was a national guard of sorts in the 
vodka belt countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland) that had some sort of 
Swiss-style arrangement. But I don't think there is.

<p>
OTOH, gun ownership for hunting purposes (almost always a shotgun) is 
perfectly legal in all Scandinavian countries. I should also mention
that according to people who (claim to) know, the shotgun is also 
a good weapon for self-defense anyway.

Easy there. Europe's just different. And each of the European countries 
are different from each other. And every single one of the residents in 
each of those countries is different from each other. As they are from 
you.

<p>
Besides. Perhaps Europeans are just better at keeping these stats?
