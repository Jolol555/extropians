  Money needed to retrieve an astronaut from orbit could be used to
save lives of hundreds people on Earth.  Rationally (that is, if we count thember 
of lives) there may be no point in getting astronauts back.
There are other examples; I strongly doubt that human ethics could
be reduced to a set of logical rules.  That is not to say that it is superior
to logic.  It's just quite often irrational.

<a name="0059qlink1">On the other hand, AIs could probably design a very consistent code that
they would require humans to follow.  Since well-backed-up AIs should be
immortal, this code will probably require that humans do not inflict
economic damage on AIs possessions - or else.  And since inefficient use
of resources by clumsy and slow humans should be rationally classified as
damage or waste, some kind of 'else' scenario - restricting human activity
to a level proportional to people's [rapidly diminishing] value - seems
inevitable...
