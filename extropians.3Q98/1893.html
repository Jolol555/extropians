<a href="1877.html#1893qlink1">&gt;So how many neurons must be in different states</a><br>

<p>
I don't know, I strongly suspect a precise point does not exist
and the transition is gradual, but things without a precise
transition point can still be as different as day and night,
for example, the difference between day and night.

<p>
Any change is not sufficient, a huge change is sufficient. The
difference between expecting to die any minute and not having
that experience is huge.</a>

<a name="1923qlink3"><a href="1877.html#1893qlink2">&gt;I certainly am not having the same thoughts now as</a><br>
<i>&gt;I was an hour ago, yet am I not the same person?</i><br>

<p>
There is no one correct answer, it's a matter of opinion and
apparently the opinion</a> of the Randel R Randel of right now is
that he is the same person he was an hour ago. Unfortunately
the much more important opinion of the Randel R Randel of an
hour from now on the subject is not available.

<a name="1923qlink4">Thought experiment: I made a copy of you an hour ago, one I let
go to live his normal life (it doesn't matter if it's the copy
or the
<br>
<a name="1952qlink2">original), the other one I chain to a time bomb set to go off in
</a>
one hour. BANG. Were you that poor fellow who just got blown up?</a>
<a name="1923qlink5">If so then you must be able to tell us what it was like to be
chained to the bomb watching the clock slowly move to the
zero hour, but you can't, you know nothing about</a> it.
