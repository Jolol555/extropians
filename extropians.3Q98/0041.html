As long as its nothing but a moonlighting money maker for some NASA guys out to
make some bucks off of the clueless, it will get nowhere. Their studies may be
useful by serious businesses to make a go of it privately, but the real impetus
will only happen when a practical method of using Helium III in commercial
fusion reactors is available. When that happens, ships will launch by the
hundreds, if not thousands.

<a name="0062qlink1">On the individual sovereignty side, we are beginning to see the start of the
migration to permanent oceanic living. The former Chairman of Norwegian Cruise
Lines is heading a company that is building a cruise Liner called "World of
ResidenSea" which will be a permanently occupied residential liner, with 286
condominiums. MAXIMUM condo price is $6.6 million.  With the cost of cruise
tourism dropping to the $200-1000 per day range, more and more people are taking
cruises (more than twice as many people as in the age of the ocean liner as the
only means of transoceanic transportation), which serve as an excellent PR
machine for permanent oceanic living projects. Of the 286 condos on this
residential liner, 65 are already sold, and the boat is not to be launched till
2001.</a>
