Title
<br>
  Biotin for diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
Source
<br>
  Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy.  44(10):511-4, 1990.
Abstract
<br>
  Biotin in high doses was given for 1-2 years to three
  diabetic patients suffering from severe diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
  Within 4-8 weeks there was a marked improvement in clinical and laboratory
  findings. It is suggested that in diabetes may exist a
  deficiency, inactivity or unavailability of Biotin,
  resulting in disordered activity of biotin-dependent enzyme,
  pyruvate carboxylase, leading to accumulation of pyruvate and/or depletion of
  aspartate, both of which play a significant role in nervous system
  metabolism. Based on our good results, regular biotin
  administration could be suggested for every diabetic patient for the
  prevention and management of peripheral neuropathy although extensive
  randomised clinical trials are required.
