<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Eliezer S. Yudkowsky &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Where are the da Vincis, the Rembrandts, the Bach or Mozart, the Homer or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Shakespeare of this age?  Why has modern art degenerated into a test to see</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; how random or tawdry art has become, and why does modern music sound like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; noise even to the teenagers?  Why are modern novels either</i><br>
<i>&gt; incomprehensible,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; why is modern philosophy incomprehensible, and why is modern poetry boring?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;[etc.]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Art is obviously in the eye of the beholder. That you happen to dislike</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;modern art (in the broadest sense of the word), doesn't mean that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;it really is less inspired. For example, quality dance (techno/trance) </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;music is imho at least (if not more) as enjoyable and intellectually </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;stimulating as the best of the old masters. It's all a matter of opening</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;up to it (of course, drugs can help too ;-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I feel like this misses the point, however.  I personally have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; frustrated by how many good artists with obvious talent focus on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; spreading of entropic memes; while some techno avoids this theme, a great</i><br>
<i>&gt; deal of the stuff I've heard plunges into entropy head first.  :(</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The answer to Eliezer's questions, however, is that for most people most of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the time, *science* is the incomprehensible noise.  Entropic art is the way</i><br>
<i>&gt; most people make "sense" of that noise, particularly by using "universal"</i><br>
<i>&gt; (ie ancient) memes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Imagine what it must be like to never really understand algebra.  Imagine a</i><br>
<i>&gt; world that is utterly "mysterious," (where "mystery" is used in the sense</i><br>
<i>&gt; of incomprehensible "mysteries of God" rather than mysteries to be solved).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  In this world, all of physics is just incomprehensible symbols on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; blackboard.  And really, what's the difference between one set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; incomprehensible symbols and another?  And who's to say they can't be biased?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As for the Shakespeares of our day, it's impossible to be Shakespeare</i><br>
<i>&gt; today, in the same sense that one can't be Newton today.  Harold Bloom of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yale has pointed out that to some extent Shakespeare tapped into something</i><br>
<i>&gt; so universal, so utterly ubiquitous in human society, that one could even</i><br>
<i>&gt; sensibly say that Shakespeare discovered his work, rather than inventing it</i><br>
<i>&gt; himself; that to some extent even Western authors who wrote *before*</i><br>
<i>&gt; Shakespeare were responding to his work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Whether or not you believe that, there's no doubting that Shakespeare took</i><br>
<i>&gt; the work that was given him and refined it to such a degree that he very</i><br>
<i>&gt; nearly perfected the forms.  More or less everyone since is either</i><br>
<i>&gt; responding to him or unconsciously reinventing Shakespeare's wheel.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Again, for comparison, imagine if today's physicists, too sollipsistic to</i><br>
<i>&gt; study the work of those who came before them, would continually rediscover</i><br>
<i>&gt; differential calculus in an attempt to create something "original.")</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, if you're keen on modern authors who are more aware of the universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; around them, I highly recommend you take a look at Thomas Pynchon's</i><br>
<i>&gt; _Gravity's Rainbow_.  However, I also strongly recommend *against* doing so</i><br>
<i>&gt; without a copy of Weisenburger's _Gravity's Rainbow Companion_, as GR</i><br>
<i>&gt; references so much from art, history, science, philosophy, etc. (and some</i><br>
<i>&gt; of it very eclectic stuff) that one really can't understand or enjoy the</i><br>
<i>&gt; book without at least 40 hrs of library research, which Weisenburger has</i><br>
<i>&gt; made somewhat easier.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Decay is inherent in all compounded things. Strive unceasingly."</i><br>
<i>&gt;          -- The last words of Buddhadasa Bhikkhu</i><br>

<p>
The bovine response that people (even nonscience professors) 
display to science in the face of a "toxic event" is epitomized in the 
Dod DeLillo book  WHITE NOISE.
