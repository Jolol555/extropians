<p>
Hardly... there are very few crazies, and they're generally going to strike
at a few big targets. For example, in the movies and books it's usually New
York or Tokyo that people decide to blow up: the lesson being that living
in either will be bad for your health if there are crazies around with
nukes. Similarly freedom fighters and terrorists are likely to attack DC or 
some other big Federal government center; the Federal building in Oklahoma 
city had been destroyed several times in fiction before it was in fact. The 
odds that some crazy will decide to drop a nuke or bioweapon on the 
village where I live is almost zero.

lived organism will naturally choose to leave sooner or later. The threat
of crazies will only increase that desire a little.

<p>
You can't, without putting electrodes in everyone's brains, and if you
try that *I'll* do everything I can to destroy you first. You might be
able to delay them a little, but any serious attempt to prevent crazies
will require oppressive measures that will ensure that freedom fighters
do nuke you.

I don't get an indefinite lifespan by sacrificing myself for the Extropian
collective; I get an indefinite lifespan by living a long time. Now, sure,
I'd much rather that we did it together than seperately. But I'm not doing
this for your benefit, I'm doing it for mine.

<p>
*Shrug* all the information is out there, if people are so ostrich-like
that they prefer not to keep themselves informed about major threats then
that's their problem.

<p>
Like what? I've had discussions about the likely effects of year-2000 bugs
on several mailing lists and been treated like an evil raving survivalist.
They don't want to hear, and certainly don't want to believe that anything
could screw up their nice tidy little lives. Tough luck to them if it does
come out bad; I can't help those who don't want my help.

<p>
BTW, one of the things I forgot to include in the list of what I know about 
year 2000 bugs as a programmer:


<UL>
  <li>  There are no manual backups for many computer systems.


</UL>
<p>
Just one example: someone checked with a railway in the US because they
assumed the railway could obviously go back to manual switching if the 
computer systems go down. But, oops! They took out all the manual switches 
in their lines when the computers were installed. So if the computers go 
down the trains can't go anywhere unless they lay new track to replace 
the switches the computers control.
