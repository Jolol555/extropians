Police are more likely to kill innocent civilians in a shoot out than they are to
kill the criminals... hmmm

Yes, if you look at the US on a state by state basis, you will find that states
which have more freedom overall will tend to have lower crime rates. That is even
with states which are next to each other. For example, crime in Massachusetts is
very high, yet its next door neighbor, New Hampshire, which is less than 30 minutes
from downtown Boston, has a far far lower rate of crime and a much freer system of
gun laws, (we go by the concealed carry standard for everyone except felons, of
course), that is in line with small european nations. Another state bordering
Massachusetts, Vermont, has an even lower crime rate and has possibly the most free
gun laws in the nation (you need no permit at all). I have recently been seeing
some<a name="0226qlink1"> really stupid gun  laws being proposed in our state legislature, like banning
guns from all government buildings, from all public buildings, etc.</a> I expect that
<a name="0226qlink2">passage of such laws will lead to higher crime rates...</a>
