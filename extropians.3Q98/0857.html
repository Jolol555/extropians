<a href="0772.html#0857qlink1">&gt;  Why do transhumanists want to live longer?</a><br>

<p>
Transhumanism aims to increase the scope of human life in all dimensions,
including time.  The level of wisdom, knowledge and experience that can be
achieved in the short span of a single, unaugmented human life span is one of
the limits transhumanists seek to overcome through the use of technology.
  
<p>
<a href="0772.html#0857qlink2">&gt;  Isn't transhumanism tampering with nature?</a><br>


<p>
Transhumanists reject a bright line between "man" and "nature": From its
beginnings, the development of our species has been a process of positive
feedback with our technology, broadly defined as those created tools we use
that are not part of our simple genetically endowed physical structure or
behavioral repertoire. From the time of the simplest stone tools and most
primitive linguistic constructs, humanity has been engaged in extending its
capacities through the use of increasingly powerful "artificial" tools.  Thus,
"tampering with nature" is the very thing that makes us human.  Transhumanists
simply seek to continue that process -- wisely -- onto a new level of
sophistication.

<p>
<a href="0772.html#0857qlink3">&gt;  Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?</a><br>

<p>
Transhumanists seek technological means to enhance those qualities of humanity
we value the most: Our creativity and insight into the world in which we live.
Far from making us inhuman, the increased power transhumanists seek promises a
liberation from the very limits that cause "inhumanity".
  
<p>
<a href="0772.html#0857qlink4">&gt;  Are transhumanist technologies environmentally sound?</a><br>

<p>
I really liked Dan Clemmensen's original response to this, but can't find it
in my ExFolder . . .

<p>
<a href="0772.html#0857qlink5">&gt;  Might transhuman technologies be dangerous?</a><br>

<p>
I'll take a stab at this later . . .
