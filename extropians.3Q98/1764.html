<a name="1770qlink1">Well, suppose there were two possible worlds, A and B, that are a 
priori equally probable. In A there are a hundred humans and nothing 
else. In B there are a hundred humans and a million stones. If you 
know this and nothing more except that you exist and are a human, 
what would you say the posterior probabilities are for the two 
worlds?

<p>
I would say 1/2. Finding myself being a human would give me no 
information as to the number of stones.

<p>
But in order to get this result we need to assume that there was a 
zero chance that you would have been a stone.</a>

<a name="1770qlink2"><a href="1745.html#1764qlink2">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What prior would you assign to world * in my example?</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;That depends on such things as simplicity etc. If the three worlds</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;are equal in these repects, I would say P(*) = 1/3. This would be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;absolute prior. Then you take account of the fact that you exist, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;you rule out world * (though I'm not sure what do about the monkeys).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Then you renormalize and get P(#) = P(@) = 1/2.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; But your *prior* is before you take information into account, and you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; seem to prefer p(*) = 1/3, p(#) = 7/20, p(@) = 3/20.   I instead prefer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; all three being 1/3.  You say:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;But I too would say all absolute priors three are 1/3. But these are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the probabilities you should assign if you knew absolutely nothing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;not even that you existed. In practice, you will always know you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;exist. If you conditionalize on this information then you get</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt; &gt;p'(*)=0, p'(#)=p'(@)=1/2. Now if you want you can call this new</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;probability distribution, p'=p( _ | "I exist."), your "prior".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We seem to disagree on the math here.  And since one of the reasons</i><br>
<i>&gt; for precise models like this is so we can agree on such things, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; really aught to get this clear.  I say that since the probability</i><br>
<i>&gt; of existing conditional on being in universes # and @ is different,</i><br>

<p>
which I deny!

<p>
<a href="1745.html#1764qlink3">&gt; you can't have equal probabilities for these universes BOTH for an</a><br>
<i>&gt; absolute prior AND after you condition on existing.  If they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; equal to 1/2 after conditioning on existing, they cannot be both</i><br>
<i>&gt; equal to 1/3 before conditioning.  Could you please recheck your</i><br>
<i>&gt; calculations?</i><br>

<p>
Let's take it slowly and write it out in full:

<p>
Let * be "Universe * exists." And similarly for # and @. Let Me be "I 
exist."

<pre>
P(*)=1/3
P(#)=1/3
P(@)=1/3

</pre>
<p>
I think we have agreed about that. That's what I call the absolute 
priors. Then I say that 

<p>
P(* | Me)=0
<br>
P (#  | Me)=1/2
<br>
P (@  | Me)=1/2

<p>
By Bayes' theorem, that implies:

<p>
P(Me | *) = P(* | Me)P(Me)/P(*)
<br>
= (0*P(Me))/(1/3) = 0

<p>
Likewise:

<p>
P(Me | #) = P(# | Me)P(Me)/P(#)
<br>
= ((1/2)*P(Me))/(1/3) = (3/2)P(Me)

<p>
and

<p>
P(Me | @) = P(@ | Me)P(Me)/P(@)
<br>
= ((1/2)*P(Me))/(1/3) = (3/2)P(Me)

<p>
Since we have P(Me)=P(Me|*)P(*)+P(Me|#)P(#)+P(Me|@)P(@),

<p>
we get P(Me)=0+(3/2)P(Me)(1/3)+(3/2)P(Me)(1/3) = P(Me)

<p>
I don't see any inconsistency.

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Sure, but this reasoning only works for things that may or may not be</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;many other phenomena are correlated with the presense of observers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and then this reasoning doesn't work. For instance, as you yourself</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;wrong to use the observation that evolutionary processes here on</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;particular evolutionary process we observe had not been quick enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to happen before the sun becomes a red gigant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="1770qlink3"><i>&gt; But my paper does things exactly the way I'm reccomending here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I choose a prior to have nice natural independence properties,</i><br>

<p>
But when you are conditioning on your existing, what you do is 
increase the probability of those worlds with many observers (SIA). 
[And with the views you have expressed about the reference class 
problem, you even want to increase the estimated number of stones??? 
Let's set that to one side for the moment.] And I say, if you look in 
one place, and find an X there, then that gives you reason to believe 
there are many Xs; but *only* if the reason why you looked where you 
looked was not that there was an X there. Otherwise independence 
</a>
fails. That's why you can't infer "There are many quick evolutionary 
processes." (I assume you agree with that?) But why, then, do you 
want to infer from finding that you are an observer that there are 
many observers? (That's what you want to do, right?) This looks like 
the paradigmatic case where independence fails. Being an observer and 
finding that you are an observer are surely not statistically 
independent events. (Right?) So, since independence fails completely 
in this case, you should not infer from finding that you are an 
observer that there are many observers. (Do you accept this? If not, 
exactly where do you begin to disagree?)
