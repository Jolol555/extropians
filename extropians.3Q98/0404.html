Actually, most of these ethical systems presume that you already know what
your interests are, or can figure them out with trivial effort. 
Therefore, using what you know and the ethical formula, you can figure out
what you ought to do.

<p>
This is wrong on its face.  Rational ethics says "given what you already
know, act according to this formula."  This equation has two variables,
but one of them is already given, so we can solve for the other.

<p>
You're talking about an ethic which tells us what we should and shouldn't
WANT, not what we should and shouldn't do.  We need no such thing, because
we already have goals and desires, none of which IMO are better than
others in the relevent ethical sense, nor should they be.

<p>
Suppose we argued that we only ought to set goals which are morally
praiseworthy (where "praiseworthy" is used in its technical sense.) 
This presents us with the obvious problem:  If I want X, and I have
concluded that I ought to want Y, how do I make the transition?  If I
can't, as I suspect is the case, then this leaves me with an ethic which
states that I ought to do something I can't do.

<p>
What is it with you and the ancient gods?  Is this some form of irony?
Overdetermination?  Or a genuine yearing for the lusty days of yore?

<p>
<a href="0387.html#0404qlink5">&gt; Actually, there is one objective metric available, one which we are</a><br>

<i>&gt; doesn't deal well with reality....</i><br>

<p>
Don't be absurd.  You use your goals, however derived, within the
generalization principle, because the generalization principle has nothing
to do with deriving goals, nor does it claim to.
