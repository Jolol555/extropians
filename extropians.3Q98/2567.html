<a href="2464.html#2567qlink1">&gt; The central idea behind my post regarding the ultimate potential</a><br>
<i>&gt; of SIs and HIs is to analyze the "unknowability" and</i><br>
<i>&gt; "incomprehensibility" traits used by some to describe a post-</i><br>
<i>&gt; Singularity environment. Using the "weak SI" and "strong SI"</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinctions Nick mentioned, if the post-Singularity universe is</i><br>
<i>&gt; populated by weak SIs then it will be comprehensible to us. If it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is populated by strong SIs then it will be incomprehensible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The question of whether SIs will be "strong" or "weak" does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; appear to be a question of SI capabilities but instead should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; an inquiry into the nature of knowledge. Is there knowledge to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; had that is forever beyond the grasp of human intelligence (even</i><br>
<i>&gt; amplified HI)? Its a epistemological question which I doubt can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be resolved easily. Such knowledge would be beyond our abilities</i><br>
<i>&gt; of recognition, inference, deduction and modelling. We can not</i><br>
<i>&gt; speculate on the feasibility of the existence of such knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; since, by definition, we can not appreciate the validity of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge. Why should we assume such knowledge exists except out</i><br>
<i>&gt; of some ill-advised attempt at anthropic humility?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If a SI is a strong/qualitative SI then it will be able to access</i><br>
<i>&gt; these areas of knowledge that HIs can not. This type of situation</i><br>
<i>&gt; parallels the turbo dog brain example Nick described. HI is</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualitatively superior to &gt;DI because of HI abilities of cognition,</i><br>
<i>&gt; deduction, modelling, inference, etc. However, if we modified the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;DI's software then it might achieve HI levels. If a SI is only</i><br>
<i>&gt; a weak/quantitative SI then it might think faster and more</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficiently, but it would not be able to access those areas of</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge unknowable to HIs. The weak/quantitatively-superior SI</i><br>
<i>&gt; would reach milestones faster but it would not reach more milestones</i><br>
<i>&gt; overall.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2643qlink1"><i>&gt; The Knowledge Question raises an interesting issue. Even if</i><br>
<i>&gt; Strong SIs existed, how would we properly recognize them as Strong</i><br>
<i>&gt; SIs? Since the knowledge they accessed that heralded their</i><br>
<i>&gt; ascension to Strong SI status is beyond our ability to appreciate,</i><br>
<i>&gt; how could we distinguish between a Strong SI and a Weak SI that</i><br>
<i>&gt; has lost its marbles?</a> When faced with such a choice it appears</i><br>
<i>&gt; that our only guidance becomes the faith we have in the SI. Either</i><br>
<i>&gt; we say, "Gee, what the SI is doing now is completely beyond me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since its a SI, it probably knows what its doing. Its a Strong SI"</i><br>
<i>&gt; or we say, "This thing has gone nuts." Another problem is</i><br>
<i>&gt; differentiating between knowledge that is forever beyond us and</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge that is beyond us for now but will be understandable</i><br>
<i>&gt; after another 200 years of scientific work.</i><br>

 I think that the problem of determining the existance of a strong SI is
a real one. The old line about, how do you explain what blue means to
someone who is blind, seems pertainent. The main difference that I can
see between SI's and between them and  ourselves for that matter is one
of the quality of  perception, not the quantity of  factual knowledge. A
strong SI might start out being very ignorant of factual knowledge but
due to its trancendentally superior perception would not stay in that
state for long. A hare rather than a tortoise.
