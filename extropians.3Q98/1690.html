Abstract
<br>
  OBJECTIVES: To compare importance of rate of initial weight loss for long
  term outcome in obese patients and to compare efficacy of two different
  weight maintenance programmes. DESIGN: Subjects were randomised to either
  rapid or slow initial weight loss. Completing patients were re-randomised to
  one year weight maintenance programme of ad lib diet or
  fixed energy intake diet. Patients were followed up one year
  later. SETTING: University research department in Copenhagen, Denmark.
  SUBJECTS: 43 (41 women) obese adults (body mass index 27-40) who were
  otherwise healthy living in or around Copenhagen. INTERVENTIONS: 8 weeks of
  low energy diet (2 MJ/day) or 17 weeks of conventional
  diet (5 MJ/day), both supported by an anorectic compound
<br>
  (ephedrine 20 mg and caffeine 200 mg thrice daily); one year weight<br>
  maintenance programme of ad lib, low fat, high carbohydrate
  diet or fixed energy intake diet (&lt; or =
  7.8 MJ/day), both with reinforcement sessions 2-3 times monthly. MAIN OUTCOME
  MEASURES: Mean initial weight loss and proportion of patients maintaining a
  weight loss of &gt; 5 kg at follow up. RESULTS: Mean initial weight loss was
  12.6 kg (95% confidence interval 10.9 to 14.3 kg) in rapid weight loss group
  and 12.6 (9.9 to 15.3) kg in conventional diet group. Rate
  of initial weight loss had no effect on weight maintenance after 6 or 12
  months of weight maintenance or at follow up. After weight maintenance
  programme, the ad lib group had maintained 13.2 (8.1 to 18.3) kg of the
  initial weight loss of 13.5 (11.4 to 15.5) kg, and the fixed energy intake
  group had maintained 9.7 (6.1 to 13.3) kg of the initial 13.8 (11.8 to 15.7)
  kg weight loss (group difference 3.5 (-2.4 to 9.3) kg). Regained weight at
  follow up was greater in fixed energy intake group than in ad lib group (11.3
<br>
  (7.1 to 15.5) kg v 5.4 (2.3 to 8.6) kg, group difference 5.9 (0.7 to 11.1)<br>
  kg, P &lt; 0.03). At follow up, 65% of ad lib group and 40% of fixed energy
  intake group had maintained a weight loss of &gt; 5 kg (P &lt; 0.07). CONCLUSION:
  Ad lib, low fat, high carbohydrate diet was superior to
  fixed energy intake for maintaining weight after a major weight loss. The
  rate of the initial weight loss did not influence long term outcome.
