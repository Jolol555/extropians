Yet another attempt to shroud the truth with cover-up tactics.  I did not 
initially realize how widespread this censorship conspiracy had become, I had 
hoped it was limited to a few insiders -- Max's inner circle.  However the 
swiftness with which a handful of individuals came to Max's defense has 
convinced me otherwise.  If they aren't in on it themselves, they are clearly 
under the delusion that Max and his ilk can do no wrong.  I think everyone 
needs to take a long hard look at the evidence and not make premature 
judgements -- there may be forces acting in opposition to the common good, as 
there generally are.
