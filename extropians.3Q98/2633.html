This happened before in history and continues to happen now.  The basic
thing we are looking at here is how the mainstream views people and
groups who think differently.  In this case, anyone who predicts the status
quo (in politics or medicine or technology) will cease to exist in a few years
is going to be seen as a bit of a kook.

<p>
And what usually happens, if enough people jump on board with the alleged
kook(s) is a movement starts.  The movement then creates its own organs
(e.g., clubs, publications, conferences) and its own "mainstream."  As it
grows, it may become more respected by the wider mainstream in which
it exists.  Typically, the movement begins to cross-pollinate with the wider
mainstream -- by conscious infilitration (as with Fabian socialists in England
and Objectivists in America) or just by living in the same society (which
happens anyway as both the alleged kooks and the mainstream participate
in much of the culture).

<p>
Others have pointed this out (notably, Bryan Caplan), but I thought it worth
bringing up here for two reasons.  One, it represents a study of meme flow
-- via meme ecology if you will.  I'll leave the details of this to others.
Two,
<br>
we might, by studying previous cultural changes (such as the rise of
Fabianism in England or of the New Left in America) discover what methods
work best to get our ideas out there and, hopefully, in competition with all
the other alternatives.

<p>
Have a fine day!
