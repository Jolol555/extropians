<a name="0111qlink1">I think the Japanese doomsday sect (Ohm?) is
particularly interesting. AFIAK it was
<br>
co-ordinated by one man (the leader, forget his
name) who used some quite ingenious "brainwashing"
techniques.  Japanese investigators found that he
used a system of voice synthesis to alter his own
voice in a way that "imprinted" ideas on his
followers.  I don't know the specifics, or quite
how feasible this is, but along with the drugs and
electroshock therapy it seemed to work.
