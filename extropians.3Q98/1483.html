<p>
i hope there is a medical type out there who can help me with thisquestion.
years ago someone told me that chimps can accept human
blood transfusions.  this was tried, and worked. true?

<p>
so, can humans accept transfusions from chimps?  has it been
tried?  if blood, can we get a transplant of other organs?
how about an entire body?  i saw an article that a doctor
had switched the heads of two monkeys and they both
lived.  quadraplegic of course, but they lived.

<p>
if one had a bad disease such as emphasema, and one
did not believe in cryonics, but wanted desperately
to live, could one have one's head transplanted onto
the body of a chimp?  spike
