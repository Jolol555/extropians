Why?

<p>
Yes, but what does that have to do with the thought experiment we were
discussing? These two are not of the exact same pattern of mind or even
approximately so, one is terrified and in despair and the other is not.
Also, the amount of time that passed since the two copies were made by
itself is irrelevant, the important thing is how much they have changed
not how long ago they were made. When it gets to the point that one is
having thoughts the other is not then there are two people, if not then
there is only one, and it doesn't matter if it takes one minute or one
decade.</a>
