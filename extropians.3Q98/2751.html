<p>
felicitously named?  thanks!  {8^D  but the moniker wasnt for anticipating
the singularity im afraid.  there is a cartoon where a wolf is spotted
by a bulldog who bites him on the buttocks and wont let go.  the wolf tries
whacking him with a stick, conking him repeatedly with an anvil (clank
clank clank), tries prying the stubborn animal off with a crowbar, all
to no avail.  finally the wolf removes his pants and leaves them behind
with the bulldog still attached.  for this resolute beast i was nicknamed.

<p>
i shall seek a copy of  THE SPIKE.
<br>
is it carried by barnes and noble?  borders books?  spike
