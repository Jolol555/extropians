Possible Stroke Drug Is Tested

<p>
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal scientists have begun
testing in rats a chemical from marijuana that they 
say appears to protect brain cells during a stroke. 

<p>
``This is a better candidate'' against stroke than 
other marijuana chemicals, said Aiden Hampson of 
the National Institute of Mental Health. 

<p>
His study, published in this week's Proceedings of 
the National Academy of Sciences, found that in a 
test tube, cannabidiol proved to be a potent antioxidant
 that protected animal brain cells exposed 
to the toxic neurochemical that is produced during 
a stroke. 

<p>
Until now, cannabidiol had been considered an inactive
ingredient, Hampson said. It was studied as a possible 
drug for Huntington's disease a decade ago but failed 
to work. However, scientists who gave high doses to 
people at that time uncovered no serious side 
effects, he said.
