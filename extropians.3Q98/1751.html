<p>
Laser Focus World (a laser trade magazine) had a nice article on this
project a few months ago. I don't recall any cost figures in that article.
The web site mentioned above has more nice pictures, but less text than the
LFW article.

<p>
I think 5 years is optimistic due to possible guidance problems, the little
model has little or no manuvering capacity, and though there are methods
for compensating for air turbulence, these are low power methods and I
don't think they can be applied for high power IR lasers.

<p>
In the long term, this has great potential. LEO requires about 20Kwh/Kg, or
about $2.60/Kg at my local PG&amp;E ripoff rates. At 1% system efficiency, this
is $260/Kg, definitely an improvement over the $3000/Kg for the Space
Shuttle. (Note: IR CO2 lasers operate at about 15%, so we have a 15x fudge
factor here)

<p>
As for average joe satellites, when costs get this low, orbits become a
scarce resource, just as they are for geosynch slots right now. And such
resources become by necessity regulated.....
