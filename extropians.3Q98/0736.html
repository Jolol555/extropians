evidence

<a href="0692.html#0736qlink4">&gt;that you  were reading my mind correctly and your feelings were anything</a><br>

step beyond Turing Tests.

<p>
<a href="0639.html#0736qlink7">&gt;        &gt;as that is the only way such a memory could be produced.</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0692.html#0736qlink8">&gt;That part is certainly untrue, all the memories from my childhood could</a><br>
have 
<br>
<a href="0692.html#0736qlink9">&gt;been produced by nano machines 5 minutes ago.</a><br>

<p>
Yes; I should have said, "produced in the human brain".

<p>
<a href="0639.html#0736qlink10">&gt;        &gt;I only have to *know* that you thought about being conscious,</a><br>
<pre>
which         
<br>
<a href="0692.html#0736qlink11">&gt;        &gt;is the same as being conscious.</a><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actually, except when I'm arguing Philosophy on The Extropian List I</i><br>
seldom 
<br>
<a href="0692.html#0736qlink12">&gt;think about being conscious.</a><br>

<p>
The important thing is that you can consider it.

<p>
<a href="0692.html#0736qlink13">&gt;        &gt;But if no one died, who is that dead guy?  </a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't see any dead guy, I just see a bunch of nasty looking </i><br>
<i>&gt;protoplasm.</i><br>

<p>
I'm sorry to hear that.

<br>
<a href="0639.html#0736qlink14">&gt;        &gt;Did the consciousness inside him magically jump to the other   </a><br>
     
<br>
<a href="0692.html#0736qlink15">&gt;        &gt;John Clark and combine with it?          </a><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It didn't have to jump because if consciousness has a spatial location,</i><br>
which 
<br>
<a href="0692.html#0736qlink16">&gt;is doubtful, it's certainly not where the brain is but where the senses</a><br>
are. 

<p>
<a name="0784qlink8"><a name="0749qlink3">Any *particular* consciousness *must* have</a> a
spatial location.  To say<a name="0784qlink9"> that it does not is the
</a>
</a>
same as saying that it doesn't exist at all.

<p>
<a href="0692.html#0736qlink17">&gt;The brain by itself has no way of detecting position, or time for that </a><br>
<i>&gt;matter.</i><br>

<p>
Not position, yes,<a name="0749qlink4"> but I can order my memories
by "first" and "last", without any sensory data, so
</a>
it can detect time.
