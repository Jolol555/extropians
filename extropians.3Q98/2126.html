children as

<a href="2124.html#2126qlink4">&gt; young as five are ready to learn calculus, but that the brain is</a><br>
capable of

<a href="2124.html#2126qlink5">&gt; reaching correct rational conclusions without being conscious of the</a><br>
<i>&gt; process required to reach it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When we say that someone has solved a problem instinctively, that</i><br>
doesn't
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink6">&gt; mean that they've done it wrong, nor does it mean that they weren't</a><br>
being
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink7">&gt; rational (or even non-rational) as they were doing it.  Rather the</a><br>
<i>&gt; difference is simply that the process by which they solved the</i><br>
problem is
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink8">&gt; unknown, even to the thinker.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why might this sort of thinking be valuable?  Why not consciously</i><br>
work out
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink9">&gt; all of your conclusions, which would add to clarity of thought and</a><br>
avoid
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink10">&gt; confusion?  Of course, instinct is often a lot faster than the</a><br>
meticulous
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink11">&gt; layers of thought required to solve problems rationally and</a><br>
explicitly.
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink12">&gt; But more importantly, instinct may ultimately be the only way by</a><br>
which we
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink13">&gt; can "think outside the box," as it is often called: to break free of</a><br>
old
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink14">&gt; paradigms and to think about a problem in a new way.  I think that if</a><br>
<i>&gt; Extropians were to reject instinct as a mental tool we would have</i><br>
far more
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink15">&gt; to lose than to gain.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Rational thinkers of the past have often rejected the line of</i><br>
reasoning I
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink16">&gt; present above; today, in the common vocabulary, "rational thinking" is</a><br>
<i>&gt; believed to be contradictory to instinctive problem solving; without</i><br>
making
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink17">&gt; explicit disclaimers like the one I gave above, I can think of no</a><br>
way to
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink18">&gt; make it clear that Extropians welcome instinct as a mental tool, but</a><br>
insist
<br>
<a href="2124.html#2126qlink19">&gt; that it must also be supplemented by a conscious criticism of our</a><br>
own ideas.

<p>
<a name="2127qlink1">If you include this disclaimer you'll need to add another disclaimer
to cover the natural born instincts that are in direct conflict of
interest with our goals.  This is getting messy.</a>

<p>
<a name="2129qlink1"><a name="2127qlink2">Maybe its just nostalgia, but I remember liking one of the early (1.?)
versions of the principles more than any that has come since.  I wish
I would have saved it.  What is an effective way to edit a document
without getting the phenomena of "over editing"?</a></a>
