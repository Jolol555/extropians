Brave New World?  Happy Drugs?  Kinda stretchin things aren't ya?
Extropians would certainly consider gene therapy or drugs that were designed
to enhance our life spans or our intelligence.  Why would we not be
interested in personality enhancements as well?

I agree.  I only add that neuroscience needs to continue its efforts to
understand personality structure and development so that effective
treatments can be found.  BTW, APDs almost always have conduct disorder
problems as teens and many come from environments that are nurturing.
