<a href="2012.html#2019qlink1">&gt;Your thought experiment, that I've omitted here, about my</a><br>
<i>&gt;biological twin brother shows you have missed my point</i><br>
<i>&gt;completely.</i><br>

<p>
You're correct, I don't understand your point. The Joe Jenkins who grew
up in China is not you but the Joe Jenkins chained to a bomb has no
fear because he's the same person having fun at a party. It does not
compute.

<a name="2040qlink2"><i>&gt;The fuzzy area of identity is bounded by what my ego would</i><br>
<a href="2012.html#2019qlink2">&gt;perceive as me, not by all the states my biological brain could</a><br>
<i>&gt;achieve as dictated by my genes.</i><br>

<p>
In other words, if I think it's me it is. Sounds reasonable, but</a> if I'm
<a name="2040qlink3">chained to a bomb I don't think I'm having fun at a party so that must
be some other fellow.</a>

<p>
<a name="2040qlink4"><a href="2012.html#2019qlink3">&gt;Under normal circumstances I'd say the fuzzy area in my identity</a><br>
<i>&gt;line would be from 5 years to one month ago.</i><br>

<p>
Time is irrelevant, accuracy of the copies is not.</a>

<a name="2040qlink5"><a href="2012.html#2019qlink4">&gt;We are in a three minute non recoverable free fall headed strait</a><br>
<i>&gt;for assured destruction with the ground.  All three of us did a</i><br>
<i>&gt;backup procedure last week.  Mr. Randall is shitting his pants,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Mr. Clark is trembling and sweating and believe it or not,</i><br>
<i>&gt;praying.  I'm looking at these guys, laughing my head off,</i><br>
<i>&gt;completely entertained by this whole thing.</i><br>


<p>
Everybody likes to fantasize but nobody, including you, can know how
you would react in an actual life or death situation, I suspect</a> that in
<a name="2040qlink6">real life your behavior would be somewhat different. But perhaps not,
some people would act in the way you suggest even if they had</a> no backup
<a name="2040qlink7">and expected nothing but oblivion. To each their own, there is nothing
logical or illogical in the desire for self preservation, it's just a
tendency that exists in most but not all people.</a>
