In a message dated 98-07-03 12:26:50 EDT, you write:

<p>
&lt;&lt;  &gt; at least be issued an ID.  I don't however think that you should be
required
<br>
<a href="0126.html#0310qlink1">  &gt; to carry it when, say, taking a stroll around the neighborhood.</a><br>
  
<p>
 Xactly. You _will_ wind up in jail for a day if failing to produce
 appropriate credentials in Moscow, Russia. (I don't carry my passport, 
 and s &gt;&gt;

<p>
You can be arrested or as the police phrase it "detained" in this country for
not carrying an ID..If a law enforcement official stops you for whatever
reason and asks for your ID and you have none he/she has the power to detain
you, bring you into the station house, fingerprint you.  These laws are known
as vagrancy laws and include such items as being charged with vagrancy if one
does not have at least $10.00 in cash, or some other ready source of money.
(ATM card, credit card, travellers check..)  Not all of the variations are on
the books in all states, but if you think you can take a midnight stroll down
the boardwalk with out carrying ID, you might be in for a rude surprise.
