<a href="2318.html#2329qlink1">&gt; I first learned of Vinge's Singularity concept in his novel Marooned in</a><br>
<i>&gt; Realtime.  This novel deals with survivors who were in stasis and missed</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Singularity, which left the world mysteriously absent of human life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; From the information in the novel given by the character who lived closest</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the Singularity, it does not appear to have been caused by advanced AI.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Instead, it is a matter of technology allowing for telepathy-like powers</i><br>
<i>&gt; which create a group mind.  It appears that Earth was on its way to</i><br>
<i>&gt; binding everyone together into a super-intelligence which would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; powers far beyond the individuals involved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know if Vinge advances this hypothesis seriously in his nonfiction</i><br>
<i>&gt; writings but it does appear that he originally conceived of a Singularity</i><br>
<i>&gt; through other paths than AI.</i><br>

<p>
True.  "Run, Bookworm, Run", the first story in _True Names And Other
Dangers_, was centered on intelligence enhancement.  "True Names", the second
story, was about intelligence enhancement through neurocomputer interfaces; so
was the Realtime series.  Only in _A Fire Upon The Deep_ do we meet Powers of
pure AI.

<p>
But.  Intelligence enhancement is a Slow Horizon, with a relatively long
takeoff time; intelligence enhancing technology enhancing intelligence, a
two-stage cycle.  Great for _stories_, because dealing with a pure-AI
one-step-cycle Power requires a great big Zone.

<p>
In real life, I expect the Singularity to occur due to AI.  Although I have
also written guides to neurosurgical intelligence enhancement, the methods
require years of lead-time, and for true effectiveness must begin in infancy. 
There might be a few Specialists writing the Last Lines of Code, but we will
not actually be the Singularity.
