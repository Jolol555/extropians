Its kinda amusing that people are getting so indignant about this hot 
babe thing. Sure, the guy that made the point was an ass. Pity him, dont 
engage him in discourse.<a name="1365qlink1"> This whole feigned indignance thing that some 
people have going on is the real amusement. These people have more 
plastic than a power ranger suit and post doctored pictures of 
themselves in tight leather, speedos, and lathered in oil.</a> But say the 
term 'hot babe' and its time to be haughty. 

<p>
Its my fault this whole things got started when I posted about the 
'Nerds should rot' article in the Boston Globe. We've got an image. 
Whether we like it or not its there. We're a group of tech geeks with a 
few plastic hippies thrown in for good measure. Hey, we love our 
geekness. Anyone with a geek code knows that.

Geekly yours,
