...ian thanks for the links.  please let me take another run at a thread
that
<br>
 i attempted some weeks ago, but im afraid the point was lost in a storm
of
<br>
protest over privacy concerns.

<p>
recently while shopping for a new car, i visited websites for owners of
that model.  i learned more about potential problems with that
particular
<br>
model from that website in one afternoon than i would have learned in
years
<br>
of collecting anecdotal evidence.  this is simply because the  sample
size (all
<br>
owners who like to post on the web) is enormous compared to all the
friends
<br>
i am ever likely to have.  {8^D  the web is an enormously powerful
tool in the advance of humankind, yet we are not using it anywhere near
its
<br>
mind boggling potential.

<p>
nowthen, could not the same web facilitated experience base technique be

<p>
applied to health concerns?  are not issues regarding health of our
bodies far
<br>
more critical than the health of our cars?  friends, we standing on the
threshold
<br>
of a dream.

<p>
<a name="2658qlink2">please work with me, privacy people: how can we use the web to compile a

<p>
database on quiet, elusive signals (such as the effect of vitamin e on
breast cancer)?
<br>
how can we extract the critical signal while ensuring the participants
privacy enough
<br>
to encourage widespread participation in web based health studies?
would we
<br>
need a large group of people to post every habit, complete diet
information,
<br>
complete medical history, form the proverbial info-nudist colony, in
order to
<br>
determine if vitamins prevent breast cancer?  spike
