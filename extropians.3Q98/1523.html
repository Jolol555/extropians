Your claim and Saul's are compatible.  Together they imply almost
universal disbelief that nanotech will do what its proponents claim.
I am fascinated this sort of disagreement phenomena.  Why are
proponents so confident in the face of strong skepticism, and why are
skeptics so confident in the face of strong minority disagreement?
How does each side explain the other side's behavior, and how does
each side think the other side explains it?&gt;

<p>
<i>&gt;From my perspective, it was Arthur C. Clarke's discussions on the </i><br>
conceptual lack of distinction between organic and inorganic that was 
crucial, prior to Drexler. This debate was articulated many years ago, 
and 20s and 30s sf in terms of the notion 'android' and artificial 
cells. The reason why debate was held back was the extreme difficulty in 
understanding and scanning cellular processes prior to DNA research and 
computing ability. This inhibitor was so extreme that things that were 
otherwise conceptually logical were (and still are) seen as impossible 
to verify. I remember arguing for the logic of cloning in 1978 CE to 
extreme derision at my final year of high school. But I was dumb. 
Although I realized the inevitability of AI bootstrapping I failed to 
see the connection between different molecular systems for different 
maps of sentiency, bootstrapping and environmental manipulation. (Though 
I did predict the principles of nanotech in relation to advanced 
automation - the micro-macro approach can be reversed given sufficiently 
high level technology). I certainly won't be as shortsighted again - I 
predict the principles inherent in nanotech will be applicable at the 
quantum level and beyond (call it rashon-manipulation if you like, or 
whatever). Just a feeling.

<p>
The point of the above is that most thinking readers disbelieved in 
cryonics because of the inevitable breakages in dethawing. Nanotech 
overcomes this problem (in terms of logic) so assuming the neuron 
markers in electrochemical patterning (the firing circles etc.) can be 
reactivated (seems logical) cryonics is OK. Heinlein didn't go for it - 
was he trying to make a point about World-as-Mythos? Coast Guard 
funeral, perhaps. Hmm...
