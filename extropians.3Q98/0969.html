<p>
Real world is asynchronous, there are no iterations. The generations
time spans would diverge according to each autoreplicator's complexity 
(if the latter is diverging, which is not certain: a Gray Goo (minimal 
replicator size) could be the darwinian equivalent of a single deep 
global minimum, so that nothing significantly more complex could evolve. 
Otoh, we could also have extremely large (hierarchically structured?) 
individua of stellar scale and beyond. It would be fun to conduct some 
realistic ALife experiments re the individual size).

<p>
<a href="0959.html#0969qlink2"> &gt; each iteration, this argument begins to depend heavily on which iteration</a><br>

<i> &gt; iteration-set, if there is a bifurcation into many different forms of</i><br>
<i> &gt; transhumanity) will be as large as that between humanity and insects.</i><br>

<p>
Given that generation time of evolved virtual species could be on the
order of us and lower, and that things material could be remassaged on 
the scale of minutes/hours, humanity doesn't have the ghost of a
chance to adapt.

At best, it perceives a cataclysm in action. At worst, it does
perceive nothing because it's extinct.
