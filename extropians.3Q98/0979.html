<p>
And a sidelight which reflects the many inaccuracies and hype which
surround this topic: the L.A. Times story mentioned that no replications
of the Dolly experiment had previously succeeded, either with sheep
or cows.  All the other cases of so-called cloning were not based on
adult cells, but relied on fetal or embryo cells.  That is why this
result with mice is so important.  The Dolly people are now breathing
a sigh of relief, taking this as confirmation of the basic principle
of cloning of adult cells.

<p>
This previous lack of replication was certainly not the impression given
by the press in all the coverage of "cloning" since Dolly.

: several prominent biologists had argued that the famous sheep was not<br>
