Sorry for being notoriously informal, it means that certain
developments start to lag relatively to the hitherto linear log plot
of some relevant metric vs. time.

<a name="0896qlink5">Hmm, let's see. (Btw, would you let me have a copy of your algorithm

<a href="0797.html#0852qlink3"> &gt; 1) Number of his/her human decendants in 2098</a><br>

<p>
Anything from zero (we can't go negative, can we?) to some 
</a>
absurdly (really really transastronomically postabsurdly) high number. 
(If 'number' and 'human' and 'individual' still mean 
something by then, that is, things like timelike closed curves and
timespace engineering considered. Recent news about GUT unification 
energy reconsideration considered, nothing will ever surprise me).

<p>
<a href="0797.html#0852qlink4"> &gt; 2) Median physical mass of each descendant in 2098</a><br>

<p>
If physical mass has a meaning after some timespace engineering (show
me a proof you can't do that by 2098). Even if you can't build these, 
I still have no idea how many persons can really fit into the volume 
of a glass of water, whether quantum computers, or no. What's the mass 
of matter in the PS lightcone @ 2098?) (And molecular circuitry we 
will certainly to be able to do by then. Urgh. Was this a forecast? 
Forget whatever I said).

<p>
<a href="0797.html#0852qlink5"> &gt; 3) Median age till death of each descendant in 2098</a><br>

<p>
Age? (Well, if you go Lamarckian, identity stops having its canonical
meaning). Death? What's that?

<p>
<a href="0797.html#0852qlink6"> &gt; 4) Median number of immediate descendants of each descendant</a><br>

<p>
If identity still exists, as does timespace.

<p>
<a href="0797.html#0852qlink7"> &gt; 5) Median distance each descendant lives from where he lives</a><br>

<p>
Urrr. 'Distance'? 'Live'?

<p>
<a href="0797.html#0852qlink8"> &gt; 6) Modal religious affiliation of descendants</a><br>
 
<p>
'Religion'?

<p>
{Allright, I've been deliberately nonconstructively dadaist (within
my current mental model), but point (still) is: you can't be sure what 
actually happens. Personally, I would adhere to more conservative
scenarious (you'd be surprised), but no one can't be certain. No,
sir. Not even Robin Hanson.}

The distinction is not practical. Yes you would, much good this will
do you.
