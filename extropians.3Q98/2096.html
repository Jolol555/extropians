Yes, but see below.

Okay.

It bothers me that some people on the list (I'm not thinking of Robin)
apparently have no empathy for the *ruinous experience* of those who get
thrown out of work, especially those over 40, and those who never get
started - those who are unemployed precisely because of the `rationality'
of the current economic protocols.  Robin's list is interesting, but I see
that he ends with insurance as a mitigating measure.  Decent societies have
that built-in, but it still doesn't touch the social/spiritual corrosion of
not having work or a meaningful time-binding, community-nurturing role in a
job-oriented culture.

I find the throw-away rhetorical equation of structural unemployment with
`ill health' and `stupidity' rather disturbing.  (Of course, we *can* do a
lot about ill-health, on both the individual and the communal scales, and
already do.  Sadly, Australia, e.g., seems to be dismantling its
once-excellent public health system in the name of economic rationalism,
thereby locking plenty of jobless or retired people into a downward spiral.
 Sigh.)

<a name="2111qlink1">I raised a preposterously large topic, and I think Robin's approach of
breaking it down into modules makes good sense.  den Otter's comments about
automation concur with my own basic utopian/dystopian estimate of the
imminent collapse of a jobs-based economy, but all he addresses is the
question of providing basic food, clothing, housing.  (And Robin can
explain why his precise model is economically hopeless anyway.)</a>  But that

workable - even though the land is still there, the crops could still be
grown, the oil pumped, the machines cleaned and run...  Presumably *that*
is the evidence libertarians would point to, when arguing the failure of
systems allegedly run for the good of the collective.  I'd argue that it's
a transition from one gangsterism to another.  But that's another debate...
