Wrong. Violent crime is down due to a) greater ease for law abiding citizens to
go about their business armed (as evidenced by states retaining restrictive gun
policies have not seen their vilent crime rates drop at all or nearly as much as
states with liberalized gun laws), as well as b) youths that commit violent crime
usually wind up in jail for long terms now, or get shot by rivals. Once a crook
is shot by another crook, you have an immediate reduction in crime for the
future.
