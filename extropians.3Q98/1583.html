<a href="1582.html#1583qlink1">&lt;&lt; it doesn't help in any way. i know of a pyramid scam in germany (where</a><br>
 pyramid schemes are not allowed by the government) where they covered
 the systems by trading appartment shares.
 this was also quite a big company, they made meeting-parties with the
 customers and alike.
<br>
 and all of a sudden, the head dissappeared with the money :).
 
<p>
 everyone who still falls for stuff like this truly deserves having lost
 his money.
 
<p>
 get some tech stocks if you want to make money fast...

<a name="1585qlink1">Pyramids are simple and work if done</a> right, there's a lot of people that scam
others, and theres a few good companies that everyone helps out everyone else,
and have been for years.<a name="1585qlink2"> I think they're a good idea, it redistributes the
</a>
wealth, and in many cases works out.  Lets say you pay $60 to join (which goes
to those above you, the upline), and a portion of money from everyone (up to a
certain amount) in your downline's initial payment goes to you, and others in
your downline and upline, depending on the source, you end up with a good sum
of money.  This money can come in every month (from $50 to a few hundred?
perhaps thousands) if everyone pays a monthly fee, which is only required if
you have the downline to cover it.  This is all moderated by an overhead
company, who needs to be trusted, and would retain a small percentage for
operating fees (they're main money coming from the same way your's is).
Everyone is the head of their own pyramid, the scams come from the greed in
the beginning, or people caught at the end of a shutdown of the company.
<a name="1585qlink3">These are not called pyramids, and are not illegal, if there is a product in
exchange for the initial payment.  The deal is, you have to convince people to
join and do the same thing you're doing.  I dunno, thats just an outline of
the impression I get.  Seems like companies with good products stay around for
much longer, and are more successful.  The idea seems like, you get 3 friends
to join, they get 3 friends, and they get 3 friends, so</a> on.. and if it
happens, you get paid a lot of money, and if everyone sticks around, you get
more.  Some sense tells me that it wont work, because if you follow the line
it grows to infinity, and theres not an infinite amount of people, but then
again, that plays into the redistribution of wealth, and one person doesnt
need an infinite amount, only a few dozen.
