You have to be careful with the line of reasoning that says you can
just define yourself to be whatever you want.  Otherwise I define "me"
as including every member of the human race.  Presto, I am virtually
immortal, incredibly powerful, spread over the entire planet, able to
work my will virtually anywhere.  (Of course I do have a bit of trouble
</a>
<a name="2048qlink2">making up my mind.)  This seems to be a very attractive definition of
identity from the pragmatic point of view.  But somehow it seems</a> to miss
the point, doesn't it?
