I think we are talking about things that are beyond amateur groups here.

<i>&gt;high volume of cryogenic liquids to combustion chamber pressure.</i><br>
Selection of the pumping and thrust chamber cooling design is basic to liquid motor design.  There are two main schools: Pump fed, and pressure fed.  Pressure fed systems are simplest, but the tanks are necessarily heavier.  This increases the empty mass fraction relative to a pump fed system.  Seeking performance despite the cost, the industry went to pumps.  Carbon fiber tanks reduce the pressure-fed weight penalty, and this changes the tradeoff from what it used to be.  Truax/Aerojet's second stage designs run at only a 75PSI chamber pressure, taking advantage of the vacuum to allow this without sacrificing expansion ratio (ISP).  This also reduces the tank weight penalty.

But it's a well understood problem, with (partially) off-the-shelf solutions.  No surprises.

Hmmn.  I doubt you can get away without thrust vector control, especially for the second stage.  A rocket doing an orbital insertion wants to fly a precise arc, optimizing various losses and winding up in the desired orbit.  As for the aspect ratio of the rocket, two points.  One, pressure fed rockets have very stiff, strong tank walls, and don't suffer structural problems of pump fed designs.  Two, as you make a rocket bigger, the scaling laws say that aerodynamic forces matter less, and so the shape optimizes towards a short, wide one as the size goes up.

<p>
<a href="1477.html#1509qlink5">&gt;either way, the roton is within the reach of sophisticated amateurs and</a><br>
<i>&gt;underfunded entrepreneurs.</i><br>
Only in the sense that any design is, in my opinion: One can afford to play with them, but to field a successful launcher... Just how deep are your pockets?
