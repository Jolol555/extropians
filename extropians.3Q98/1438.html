<p>
I agree with your description of the process, but resist calling it 
"insidious."   When one individual makes a claim about "we", with the
rest of "we" listening, that offers a challenge to the rest of the group.
If other members disagree with this assessment, they should speak up and 
contest the claim.  If still others then support this rebuttal, the 
original claim will be suspect.  

<p>
Knowing all this, those who see that no one challenged the claim may then 
infer that either no one expected to be supported in challenging this claim,
or that some retribution would be given for disagreeing with the initial 
speaker.  If retribution seems unlikely, one might infer that no one disagreed
with the initial "we" claim.  

<p>
My claim that "we" treasure women was exactly such a call for challenges,
in the expectation that a lack of such would suggest to listeners that other
listeners agree with me.  I hope it is obvious that I would enact no 
retribution for disagreeing with me on this.

<p>
There is the more complex issue, however, of whether people expect some
sort of broader retribution against those who say they don't value
women in an open email list.
