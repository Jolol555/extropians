<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
To cut to the quick, three-phase AC would be the best choice for several
reasons. It runs large-load motors *much* more efficiently, you have less
induction loss when pushing it over long distances (so it's easier and
ultimately cheaper to deliver to your door), and AC is a bit safer for
human beings who accidentally come into contact with it (as anyone who has
accidentally grabbed (and been unable to let go of) the high voltage DC
output of, say, a neon sign, can attest) (yes, I'm guilty as 'charged')
(Although AC is by no means "safe"  - just safer  - it can still easily
kill if one is unwise/unlucky enough).

<p>
<a name="1791qlink2">For various technical reasons, we might want to have slightly lower
standard voltages than we use today, and we'd certainly all want to get on
the same frequency bandwagon</a> (the world is split between 60ishand 50ish
Hertz now, which is a pain, especially in places like Japan where they
actually have parallel electrical grids systems with each!)
