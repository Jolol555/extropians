<p>
John Heritage &lt;xebec@home.com&gt; asked about the negative resistance
article which expired off the www.buffalo.edu news server at &lt;URL:
<a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/news/Latest/ChungResistance.html">http://www.buffalo.edu/news/Latest/ChungResistance.html</a>&gt;.  I saved a
copy so I though't I'd post it and get it in the list archive.

             SUPERCONDUCTION AT ROOM TEMPERATURE:
             NEGATIVE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE SEEN IN
             CARBON COMPOSITES 

             LAS VEGAS -- Materials engineers at the University at
             Buffalo have made two discoveries that have enabled
             carbon-fiber materials to superconduct at room temperature. 

             The related discoveries were so unexpected that the researchers
             at first thought that they were mistaken. 

             Led by Deborah D.L. Chung, Ph.D., UB professor of mechanical
             and aerospace engineering, the engineers observed negative
             electrical resistance in carbon-composite materials, and zero
             resistance when these materials were combined with others that
             are conventional, positive resistors. 

             Their observation of zero resistance is the first time that this has
             been seen without cooling. Zero resistance has been seen in
             superconducting materials, but only at temperatures of 125
             degrees Kelvin, about -150 degrees Centigrade or -234 degrees
             Fahrenheit. 

             Without resistance, there is no energy loss, so the amount of
             energy that is put into a system is exactly the amount that it
             produces. 

             According to the researchers, the discovery has the potential to
             lead to much faster, far- more-efficient electronic devices,
             previously assumed to be possible only with the development of
             room-temperature superconductors. Potential applications
             include much-simpler, more-powerful electronic circuits in
             computers and far-more-efficient "smart" structural
             components for aircraft and concrete structures. 

             The research was presented here today (July 9, 1998) in a
             keynote address at the fifth International Conference on
             Composites Engineering by Chung, who holds the Niagara
             Mohawk Chair in Materials Research at UB. 

<br>
             "We have achieved zero resistance without cooling and without<br>
             a superconducting material," said Chung. 

<br>
             "With structural electronics, the structural composite itself can<br>
             act as the electrical circuitry, but the fibers in the composite are
             far less conductive than copper. Our research shows that it is
             possible to overcome that resistance and make these structural
             electronics far more efficient," she said. 

             This finding of negative resistance flies in the face of a
             fundamental law of physics: Opposites attract. 

             Chung explained that in conventional systems, the application of
             voltage causes electrons -- which carry a negative charge -- to
             move toward the high, or positive end, of the voltage gradient. 

             But in this case, the electrons move the other way, from the plus
             end of the voltage gradient to the minus end. 

<br>
             "In this case, opposites appear not to attract," said Chung. <br>

             The researchers are studying how this effect could be possible. 

             Chung, working with Shoukai Wang, a UB doctoral candidate in
             mechanical and aerospace engineering, made the discovery
             while conducting research on the intrinsic electrical properties of
             carbon composites related to developing "smart materials," in
             which she has played a leading role. 

             Chung explained that it is the unusually high pressure used to
             cure the carbon-epoxy composite that appears to be responsible
             for the finding. 

<br>
             "We were looking at the effect of curing pressure on the junction<br>
             between carbon-fiber layers, and were making electrical
             measurements of the interface," she said. "When we saw the
             negative resistance at the interface, we didn't believe it for quite
             a few months. But after checking and rechecking our
             connections, using different meters over a period of time and
             observing the continuous change of resistance from positive to
             zero and then to negative values during curing, we came to
             realize that what we were seeing was truly negative resistance." 

             According to Chung, an unknown mechanism must be at work
             that is being triggered by sufficient contact between the layers of
             carbon fibers. 

             In the experiments, two layers of carbon fibers oriented in
             different directions and bound together by epoxy, Portland
             cement or pressure demonstrated negative resistance as low as
             -8 ohms for a contact area of one square centimeter. (An ohm is
             a unit that measures electrical resistance.) 

             The researchers noted that absolute zero resistance can be
             achieved when the values of positive and negative resistors
             connected in series match exactly. 

<br>
             "It's a matter of tailoring them to make them exactly the same,"<br>
             said Chung. 

             A patent application has been filed on the invention. 

             Previous patents filed by other researchers on negative resistance
             have been limited to very narrow ranges of the voltage gradient. 

             In contrast, the UB researchers have exhibited negative
             resistance that does not vary throughout the entire gamut of the
             voltage gradient. 

             Companies that are interested in technical information on the
             invention should contact the UB Office of Technology Transfer
