         &gt;1. Isn't transhumanism tampering with nature?
 Yes.

...sort of.    Life on this planet is about evolution or extinction.
Animals either adapt to their environment or die out.   So do cultures and
civilizations.   Human beings so far have managed to ride the wave pretty
well, creating artificial habitats in even the most unihabitable places.    We
"adapt" not merely through genetic changes, but also technologies...  from the
clothes we wear to shelter us from the cold, to the artificial hearts we get
to shelter us from the pork chops we love so much.    At one point, human
beings may have to decide how much change is enough, and that might be the
point humans choose between survival and extinction... fortunately, become
transhuman, in some ways may not only help preserve many of the things that
are human in us, but make the realization of certain human values, including
peace and co-existance with our fellow beings, possible in ways never before
imagined !
