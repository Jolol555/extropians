<a href="0517.html#0530qlink1">&gt;  Just out of curiosity, what do you consider common APDs?</a></a><br>

<p>
The DSM-IV describes it thusly:

<p>
A pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others
occurring since age 15 years, as indicated by three or more of the
following:

<p>
(1)  failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as
indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest.

<p>
<a name="0562qlink2">(2) deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or
conning others for personal profit or pleasure.</a>

<p>
<a name="0562qlink3">(3) impulsivity or failure to plan</a> ahead

<p>
<a name="0562qlink4">(4) irritability and aggressiveness as indicated by repeated physical fights
</a>or assaults

<p>
<a name="0562qlink5">(5) reckless disregard for safety of self</a> or others

<p>
<a name="0562qlink6">(6) consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain
consistent work behavior or honor financial</a> obligations

<p>
<a name="0562qlink7">(7)  lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing
having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.</a>

<p>
I don't see how the definitions for Transhumanism
and APD could possibly be confused.  They strike
me as mutually exclusive, in fact.

<p>
<a href="0516.html#0530qlink4">&gt;Why is it that some many people seem</a><br>
<i>&gt;to think that if they set up a huge</i><br>
<i>&gt;centralized system it will do precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt;what they want it to do, and not be used</i><br>

<i>&gt;and it will be used by precisely the kind</i><br>
<i>&gt;of antisocial power freaks you fear.</i><br>

<p>
I'm having a hard time correlating this response
to my post.  What does advocating the treatment
of mental illness have to do with advocating a
huge centralized power structure?

<p>
and when I said,

<p>
<a href="0516.html#0530qlink5">&gt;&gt;I want society to be polite, not because it's</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;armed and scared to be anything but polite,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;but because it really feels like</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;being polite.</i><br>

<p>
Mark replied;

<p>
<a href="0516.html#0530qlink6">&gt;And if the bastards won't be polite you'll</a><br>
<i>&gt;stick electrodes in their brains til they</i><br>
<i>&gt;change their minds... No thanks.</i><br>

<p>
That statement is most certainly a gross
mischaracterization of the efforts of practitioners
in the mental health field, but you're entitled to
your opinion.
