There's certainly some truth in this: The man whose only tool is a hammer
tends to see the whole world as a nail.  Even a broad-minded carpenter seems
to return to default analogies of cutting and fastening.  As a lawyer, I tend
to perceive and analyze social issues in terms of rules of substance and
procedure, where an economist might be more likely to analyze the same problem
in terms of scarcity and bargain.  Some intellectual systems do seem to have
more pronounced tendencies in this direction: Physics and economics are both
notoriously "memetically imperialistic" in this sense, probably with good
reason.  Both have managed to create broad and deep frameworks for
understanding that have yielded real results in the world.  On the other hand,
both have had to come to terms with humbling insights from complexity theory
in recent times.
