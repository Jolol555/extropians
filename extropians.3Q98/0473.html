<p>
Computers have made major contributions to trends
in wealth, employment, and education but there are
still no radical differences in society.

<p>
I think the basic structure of society is likely
to persist for the next 20-years. People may live
longer, consume more information, etc, but that is
not a radical change and certainly not an
entirely unpredictable one.

<p>
I would say there is a greater chance of
benevolent or "useless" SI than a hostile or
useful SI. You're talking about emergent behaviour
from a fundamentally different environment to our
own. It's not only unlikely that the result, if
any, would be considered "intelligent" but it's
even less likely it would be prone to the human
whims of violence and purposeful destruction.

<p>
I think some people make the mistake of thinking
that because we are likely to create software with
human-understanding capabilities, this software
can create an emergent SI capable of taunting it's
victims before killing them. Putting all the
pieces of an SI together in such away for it to be
hostile would be an unimaginable act of
<br>
negligence. Doing it on purpose would require
unparalleled co-operation and resources.

<p>
Of course, you can always argue you have time (if
it doesn't happen in 10 years, what about 100, or
1,000?) This is true, the more time goes by the
more likely it is to happen by accident or on
purpose. It's also more likely that we will have a
greater understanding of dynamic systems and would
be able to engineer the overall behaviour to our
advantage. And if you're using SI's for any
practical purpose (evolutionary theory, cognitive
science, doing homework) it's still relatively
easy to stop it from doing any harm.

<p>
This does not mean there will be *no* emergent
behaviour, it's just unlikely anyone will call
this intelligence (unless our definition of that
word has dramatically changed). And it's even less
likely it will be hostile (although unforeseen
emergent properties will no doubt cause accidents,
and the papers will run their usual scare
stories).
