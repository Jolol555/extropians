joe, this is a concept i have been thinking about for a number of
years.  around 1990, i spent most of a summer of weekends in a
genealogical library searching my roots.  (i know get a life.  {8^D)
i realized that one such as the sutro library in san francisco lists
every american on the order of 100 times, this guess arrived at by
estimated the number of americans that have ever lived, the number
of books, the number of names in each book.  calculate, and you
find that each of your ancestors are mentioned in that library
100 times, and... you cant find em.  perhaps not even any of em.
even with advanced research techniques and indices.  we need that book
scanner.  most genealogical books are not copyrighted, and many
<a name="1048qlink1">useful sources are copyright expired.  i would cheerfully give
1k clams for such a device. spike
