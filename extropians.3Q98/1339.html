Income tax rates decreased, but other taxes increased. In particular 
increasing VAT (sales tax for American readers) from around 9% to 17.5% 
was a very significant growth in taxation. Whether one gained or lost 
depends to a large extent on how much of their income went on taxable 
items, and whether you rented or owned your own house (poll tax etc hit
renters harder because their rents rarely went down with the end of
the old property tax and they had poll tax to pay on top).

<p>
Definitely agree on that; much as I disliked Thatcher for many of her
authoritarian tendencies, she improved Britain's economy immeasurably 
during her time in office. Shame 'New Labor' are working to turn the
clock back.
