<p>
	An alternative to living longer, or even immortal is to live on "longer
than life", or "immortally".

<p>
	I've always wanted to (and still do) accomplish something in life that
will make myself or my work
<p>
	known, for a long period of time.  Of course, the idea is that I'll be
doing something that most people
<p>
	would not have thought of to do, that would have a positive enough impact
on a large enough group
<p>
	of people that I would not be forgotten, or atleast my influence would not
cease when I die.  I do not
<p>
	wish to become like the masses, content to be born, occupy resources, and
die.  

<p>
	Is this an extropian-like belief ?, or is this just something that I sense
a lot of people here might
<p>
	share?.  And I'm not looking at this from the "I must have my name known"
point of view - I'm looking
<p>
	at it as "I want to contribute something to society TRULY useful that can
be used on a wide scale".
<p>
	(or whatever)..  :-)
