So, what's the relevance of the 15-24 age group and the definition of
"self-inflicted injury"? When's a suicide not a "self-inflicted injury"?

<p>
The only overall suicide rate comparison data I can find is at:

Unfortunately for some reason my machine can't connect at this moment
to get precise figures. The data seems to put the US well below many 
European countries; oddly, Denmark was particularly bad.

Unfortunately that data is nearly a decade old, but those you gave aren't
much better. I know there are more up-to-date figures on the Web somewhere
but I didn't bookmark the page and AltaVista can't find it.
