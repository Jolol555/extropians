<a name="0863qlink5"><a name="0849qlink1">Addressing your position re discontinous (destructive)
uploading. Current physics seems to forbid realtime in vivo scans with
enough resolution without destroying the object.</a> It would be ideal to
have working incremental/gradual uploading before we croak, but it's
availability is highly uncertain, because it is pretty difficult to do even
with mechanosynthetically produced devices. So a destructive scan of a 
vitrified cerebrum ("digitizing neuroanatomy")</a> and a computational
model of it with sufficient precision is currently the best we can
hope for. Lucky thing this buys you time, lots of it, because
basically no deterioration occurs to tissue in glass matrix (let's not 
discuss the involved topic of suspension damage right now).<a name="0863qlink6"> So there is no 
original to compare for harvey-nature, so we have to devise some other 
metric for harveyness.</a> So you can check some operation signatures:
<a name="0863qlink7">high-level ones (behavioural),</a> fMRI/MEG/EEG/firing pattern
fingerprint, etc. etc.<a name="0863qlink8"> Obviously the metric for harveyinity is not
boolean, but fuzzy (reality is always messy, right?).</a> You have 
a region, not a point in persona space, as you obviously lose 
information due to the suspension damage inflicted, have uncertainties 
due the limited emulation resolution, etc. If you could have recorded 
lots of additional information, as somehow tracked your cellular
growth, and recorded anything you saw and did during your life from 
your perspective, you could use that as a source of constraints to 
narrow down the region in persona space labeled 'Harvey'. But I 
very much doubt we need _that_ much detail, because the changes 
you have to cope with during your daily life, especially towards 
the end of it, are (hopefully) so very much more drastic than the 
artefacts due to the uploading construction and operation process. 
You seem to value personal continuity so very much, but you dispense 
with it when you go to nonREM sleep, suffer a head concussion, total 
anaesthesia or a stopped bloodflow for several minutes. So this 
definition of personality is very fragile it gets violated
habitually. The question of persona trajectories being divergent 
has been handled with, already, so I believe we can skip that.

<p>
<a name="0863qlink9">Summa summarum I think your attitude towards preservation (or failure
thereof) of persona in an discontinuous upload is not rational. I,
too, have felt emotional discomfort with discontinuous uploads in the 
past. Being a question of faith (does it harvey-nature, or not?), it 
is best addressed from a point of faith; at least I have found it so.</a>
