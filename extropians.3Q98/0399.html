<a name="0423qlink2">Couldn't the "tomboyish" characteristic in both
individuals be down to chromosomes? And the
reaction of the first patient - rejecting dolls
(is this the current method of defining gender -
dolls or guns?), trying to urinate standing up,
etc. - was, it seems, after he learned of the

(and social) reaction rather than a biological one
(the social attitude towards transgender may have
changed between the two cases). If this were so it
would seem at least some of our assumptions about
gender are wrong. Of course, most of this is
speculation based on limited facts.

<p>
I would be interested to see what the researchers
involved made of the characteristics both cases
displayed (and of the connection between the
second cases gender indentity and sexuality).
