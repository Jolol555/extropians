you are right john, it is possible to exceed 1 g acceleration on levelpavement, but its
kind
<br>
of a trick: the dragster spins the tires in chlorox to melt them a little and make them
sticky.  if a car were to pull exactly one g for the quarter mile, it would make a time
of
<br>
9.083 seconds at a final speed of just over 180.  top dragsters are down in the under 6
second range and god knows how fast they are going  at the finish line these days, i
think mid 200s.

<p>
stock motorcycles are down in the low 10s now, thats stock, no spinning the tires in
bleach,
<br>
no specialty tires.  my bike will pull a power wheelie in 2 gears, but this kind of
behavior is way
<br>
non extropian and juvenile, so i blush a little, then do it anyway... {8^D  spike

ps: i am an organ donor, and have considered the possibility of a full
body donation to some unfortunate head in the event of my untimely
demise in a murdercycle related mishap...
