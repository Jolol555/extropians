<p>
I cannot recommend enough 'A History of God' by Karen Armstrong. Whilst I
am not monotheistically religious (and possibly not religious at all,
depending on your definition), this book has proved invaluable in
increasing my understanding of monotheistic religion and in answering my
questions as to why people believe what they believe and defend what they
defend in their religion. Armstrong manages to write about this issue in an
exceptionally balanced and non-judgemental way, which is both illuminating
and refreshing.

<p>
So, get over to Amazon.com and widen your meme set: whether you see it as a
gateway to common understanding (recommended approach) or an exercise in
<br>
'know-your-enemy' psychology, it won't be a wasted read, and should do much<br>
to increase the depth of discussion about religion on this list, if nothing
else.
