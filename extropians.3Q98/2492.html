<a name="2540qlink1">Isn't the problem that a key term in all of these discussions, "intelligence"
(appearing in such other key terms as "human equivalence", "augmentation",
etc.), is simply not well understood at this point?</a>  The proponents of a
"singularity" all seem to have this concept built into their basic schema of
super-acceleration in the sense that they assume that "intelligence" can be
replicated in a machine and then, once replicated, enhanced.  I'm sure that
essentially every subscriber to this list would agree with that general
assertion.  But, until this essential factor is more subject to
quantification, I doubt that analysis of the rigor you are seeking, Robin, is
possible.  That doesn't make the discussion pointless, it just makes it less
precise than we might like.
