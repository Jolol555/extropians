<a name="0419qlink2">I don't think that's correct. In the ship reference frame, The ship gets no

<a name="0419qlink4">In the earth frame, the ship is expending the same energy over</a> a longer time and

The practical problem is the source of energy and reaction mass. If you try to
carry your reaction mass, you'll need an unreasonable amount, even with a
matter/antimatter drive, which is the theoretical best for a reaction drive.
 ke=.5mv^2 is the energy you need to accelerate mass m to velocity v, but
e=mc^2 is the energy available in mass m, assuming all of it can be converted to
acceleration. But, you also need energy to carry the mass you will use later.
This is a losing propsition: read "The Physics of Star Trek" for a full
and fun treatment.

You can try to get around this by using a ram scoop, using a yet-to-be-developed
technology to sweep interstellar hydrogen from your path into your engines. This
is a bit tricky: don't try this at home. Read Poul Anderson's "Tau Zero" for a
good SF treatment of this.
