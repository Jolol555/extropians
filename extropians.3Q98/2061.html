Sorry, maybe I should have said an immutable law or some other qualifier to
mean that an implementation of this law may not always have to be in
constant use and that other valid implementations could work an economy just
as well. Capitalism is a type of implementation of a law not the law itself.
I would love to show you how a different implementation could grade scarce
things always only using a 1 to 5 scale. I know this other AI implementation

can also be consistent with regard to an economy. The problem of using
capitalism to implement an economy is that not many of its accounting
practices can be used on this AI implementation. However AI will develop its
own responses. Capitalism and what I call Neuronomy are from different state
spaces. No doubt both are quite capable of running an economy. However, my
concept of a Neuronomy can to to economics what extropians can do to
redefine the Law of Thermodynamics.
