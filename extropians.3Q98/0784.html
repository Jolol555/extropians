<a href="0749.html#0784qlink5">&gt;It does nothing of the sort. Both tests depend on you making assumptions</a><br>

<p>

<p>
<a href="0749.html#0784qlink7">&gt;hunch they are,  but you'll never be able to prove it.</a><br>

<p>
Let me put this another way.  We know that people
make similar sounds on occasion.  We also know
that people have similar brains, and that therefore
the sounds must be produced by similar processes
in those brains.<a name="0830qlink3">  The fact that a tape recorder can make
those sounds, however, does not mean that the same
processes</a> are going on in the tape recorder, since
it is a different sort of machine.<a name="0830qlink4">  Since we know, from
personal experience, that human brains *can* be 
<a name="0844qlink9">conscious, and we know that other human brains do
</a>
cause similar<a name="0844qlink10"> sounds to ours, we can assume that
</a>
</a>
they are conscious, and begin our study of consciousness
with that.

<p>
<a href="0736.html#0784qlink8">&gt;        &gt;Any *particular* consciousness *must* have a spatial</a><br>
location.To say 
<br>
<a href="0736.html#0784qlink9">&gt;        &gt;that it does not is the same as  saying that it doesn't exist</a><br>
at all.
<br>

<a href="0749.html#0784qlink10">&gt;Why? Where is the spatial location of green, </a><br>

<p>
There are certainly spatial locations of *particular*
greens; say, the green of a certain lawn.

<p>
<i>&gt;or fast, or the number eleven? </i><br>

<p>
<a name="0830qlink5">*Certain* locations contain matter with

<br>
attributes such as these.

<p>
<a href="0749.html#0784qlink11">&gt;Don't these things exist?</a><br>

<p>
Yep.

<p>
