In a species that lasts 100 million years members can have been concluding

Is this the DA conclusion?  I'd thought it was</a> that room really was imminent,
not that you're in the middle.

<a name="1520qlink4">Consider 3 species.  One has a constant number of members for almost all of
its existence.  Another has exponential growth and then sudden collapse.  A
third has a Gaussian distribution over time.  It seems to be only members of
the last can conclude they're in the middle.  Members of the second should
conclude they're near the end.  Members of the first can't conclude much of
anything; they have a 1/3 chance, say, of being in the middle third of their
history.  Not very specific.</a>

<p>
Members of the third while their numbers were increasing could conclude they
were in the first half of their history.  The trick, of course, is knowing
ahead of time what distribution applies.  My original conception of the DA
applies best to the 2nd species -- most members will be alive shortly before
they pollute themselves to death, or something.  But at most points in their
history doom is not imminent.

<a name="1520qlink5">Another thing I've never figured out is what we're supposed to do with the
conclusion of the DA, even if correct.</a>

There's something in my garden, it's been there for a week.
I tried to feed it crackers, but that only made it squeak.
I tried to wash its scaly head, but all it did was cry,
So I think I'll put it back to bed, and sing it a lullaby:
A monster's lullaby:
