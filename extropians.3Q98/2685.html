Thanks for the reference. "The semiotic binding process... uses a group
of alphabets... in a break and ignore... phase locked loop... to create
this strange attractor of anticipation... if only to shatter the present
to get to the future...

Of note, the United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (SAB)
report, "New
<br>
World Vistas - 21st Century," commissioned by the Secretary of the Air
Force and
<br>
co-signed by the Chief of Staff (94), concluded in 1996, on pages 50 and
51 of the
<br>
Executive Summary that: 

<p>
     '...Novel enhancements in Human-Machine Interaction...be
aggressively
<p>
     pursued. The ultimate interaction is Thought Control.'

Why all the above concerns the "Logic of Zero" is because I can't help
feeling that the Thugee tricked the world into a global economic minima
based on the number zero. ERGO: Ian Goddard's learned pattern of
response, which in another fora he might agree could be accounted for by
drug-induced learning without volitional cognition.

<p>
Whereas, "The human brain gets out of this eventual evolutionary trap of
closed loop cybernetics through the semiotic-based process of
"Feedforward" anticipatory strategies." I don't hold out much hope for a
world trapped by the "Logic of Zero."

<p>
        "In essence, there are forms of non-linear ergodicity that
evolve from focus at certain scalar transformations into chaos at the
next
<br>
transformation, and then back into focus at another scalar pattern. "

<p>
<a name="2698qlink1">I've often thought that the persistent idea of zero came out of a
seafaring mindset that had to deal with sink or swim facts of life. To
such as the pirate Russell and his slave traders of the British empire,
a native land based culture immersed in a greater sphere of natural
information would have a hard time grasping this cutthroat's purely
one-sided illusion of a zero-sum teleology. 

<p>
Finally I'd like to add that adjusting behavior to cut costs isn't the
way to arrive at a new statespace and that a purely objective conception
of science is nothing more than a pipe-dream; locking us ever deeper
into zero.
