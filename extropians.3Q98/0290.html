<a href="0286.html#0290qlink1">&gt;Anders and Greg have hit squarely upon a key challenge. Namely, &gt;"What is the</a><br>
<i>&gt;most efficient way to spread extropian / transhuman memes"?</i><br>

<p>
Coupled to the most efficient way of spreading these Memes, would be identifying  the time when it is most effective to embark upon such a delivery.  At this point in time when we are on the edge of the new Millenium and noise levels relating to New Age Cults and forecasts of doom  and destruction etc are reaching their peak, or will do so within the next 18 months or so, Extropian memes etc may get " tarred with the wrong brush" whch is precisely what we are trying to avoid.    Once we are a year or two
into 21C, and it has become apparent that the end might not infact be as nigh as was " believed", the potential " meme market" might be more receptive to the Transhuman /Extropian philosophy.
