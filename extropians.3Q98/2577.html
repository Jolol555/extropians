&gt;&gt; The connection with string or M theory strikes me as tenuous.  Re-entrant

&gt;&gt; As for the budded cosmoses - Smolin's is a nice current version, and

&gt;&gt; Deutsch told me that his QT multiverse theory (the Cat is definitely both

I had a lot of trouble with deciding what to believe about Schrodinger's
cat, and found myself most supportive of the ideas that involve
consciousness (the cat really is neither dead or alive, and looking at it
really makes it one or the other because of the power of being conscious of
a fact). Then<a name="2598qlink1"> last year I came across an explanation called "the
transactional approach", which completely resolved it for me. The most
mysterious thing it involves is waves travelling backward in time - which is
a feature of QED anyway. I don't know if you can find a good web page about
the transactional</a> approach, the book I read which argued it very
convincingly though was "Schrodinger's kittens", by John Gribbin.
