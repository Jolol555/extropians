This is the fundamental problem with the DA. When WE look at a
Tamagotchi, odds are that we are fairly close to the end of the fad.
But if a Tamagotchi were to look at the population of tamagotchis
about it it would have no real way of assigning a probability as to
it's position within the Tamagotchi birth-order.

<p>
You are right in that "Your chances of seeing someone with [a
Tamagotchi] are greater, the more people have them [i.e. the more time
has passed].", but OUR odds of seeing other humans do NOT vary over
time. They are 1:1, assuming a population of more then 1.
