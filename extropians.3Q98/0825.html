cannot reliably evaluate information from books or experts on human
motivational psychology, much less SI motivational psychology, and IMO
neither can you or anyone else: the field simply is not at the same level
of development as is the thermodynamics of black holes.

Human motivation is less complex than the motivations of ants?

<a name="0897qlink2">Robin, the reason I produced the list of motivations and actions was
to attempt to provide specific examples. Can you reccomend a way for
me, or another human or group of humans or construct of humans (short of
an SI) to reliably assign probabilities to that list?
