<p>
There is no one book, there is no one discipline of study or interest
centralizing "the" way. 

<p>
This was the point of my post.  

<p>
Sets of doers, thinkers crossing the boundaries of disciplines and
closed-door specializations, have tremendous influence on our lives and our
future. 

<p>
We might be asking ourselves what makes our extropian transhumanity work.
Are we actively watching it unfold?  Hypothesizing from a distance or
emerging into the flow?  Looking for just the right book to read, just the
right film to see, just the right shirt to wear, or synthesizing knowledge,
picking and choosing carefully, the best information across the information
lines.
