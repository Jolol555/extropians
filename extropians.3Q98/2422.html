<i>&gt;        Aspirin Decreases Genetic Mutations Associated with Inherited Colon Cancer</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        A new study suggests that aspirin will be a useful chemopreventative for Hereditary Colon Cancer patients</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Aspirin may prevent the development of a particular type of common hereditary colorectal cancer in those at high risk for</i><br>
<i>&gt;        the disease.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Scientists at Jefferson Medical College believe theyíve uncovered a molecular mechanism by which aspirin interferes</i><br>
<i>&gt;        with colorectal cancer development in those individuals who carry particular gene mutations that makes them very likely</i><br>
<i>&gt;        to get the disease.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        "Aspirin is a well known prophylaxis for cancer," says molecular geneticist Richard Fishel, Ph.D., professor of</i><br>
<i>&gt;        microbiology and immunology at the Kimmel Cancer Center of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, who with</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Josef Rüschoff, M.D., of the University of Regensburg, Germany, led the research. "The new twist is that aspirin</i><br>
<i>&gt;        suppresses the accumulation of mutations that are the cause of a common inherited cancer." Similar mutations are found</i><br>
<i>&gt;        in 5-10% of sporadic colorectal, endometrial and ovarian cancers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Their work appears September 15 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Drs. Fishel, Rüschoff and their colleagues examined human colon cancer cell lines with defective mismatch repair genes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;        which are necessary to fix normal cell damage that occurs when cells divide and multiply. These mismatch repair genes</i><br>
<i>&gt;        were discovered by Dr. Fishel and Dr. Richard Kolodner (now at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in San</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Diego) in 1993 to be the cause of the most common form of hereditary cancer known as Hereditary Nonpolyposis</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        The scientists then treated the colon tumor cells with two drugs: aspirin and sulindac, which are both nonsteroidal</i><br>
<i>&gt;        anti-inflammatory drugs and known cancer preventatives. They found that the drugs largely suppressed the genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;        instability that underlies the development of cancer in HNPCC.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        "Our results appear to suggest a very simple treatment for a common hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome," Dr.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Fishel says.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        For a normal cell to become a tumor cell, many mutations must occur. The accumulation of multiple mutations implies</i><br>
<i>&gt;        genetic instability. Aspirin suppresses that accumulation of these mutations. "Even sporadic [non-hereditary] cancer may</i><br>
<i>&gt;        be considered to be a genetic disease because a large number of mutations must accumulate in the tumor cells," says Dr.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Fishel "Aspirin screens for cells that are genetically stable, providing a true genetic selection against such forms of</i><br>
<i>&gt;        cancer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        "The important point here is that this [Aspirin] is an inexpensive over-the-counter drug that anyone can take. When we</i><br>
<i>&gt;        first discovered the connection of mismatch repair genes to hereditary cancer there was really nothing we could</i><br>
<i>&gt;        recommend to families besides increased [and sometimes painful] surveillance. Now we may actually be able to prevent</i><br>
<i>&gt;        the disease in these individuals and allow them to lead a normal life."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        According to Dr. Fishel, other researchers have shown that taking aspirin reduces the incidence of sporadic colorectal</i><br>
<i>&gt;        cancer in the population. "That tells you that in some fraction of the population, aspirin has some efficacy. Our results</i><br>
<i>&gt;        would suggest that the tumors which are most affected by aspirin may arise from having damaged mismatch repair</i><br>
<i>&gt;        genes. In other words, you are really only suppressing the class of tumors that are caused by having these altered</i><br>
<i>&gt;        genes."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Non-Steroid anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and sulindac are generally thought to work through the</i><br>
<i>&gt;        prostaglandin pathway via cyclooxygenase (COX). The study by Drs. Rüschoff and Fishel suggests that COX is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;        involved.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Scientists would like to find substances that reduce the effects of environmental toxicities. Aspirin looks like it will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;        one of them. At least for the mutations that occur as a result of specific genetic defects associated with hereditary and</i><br>
<i>&gt;        some sporadic tumor cells.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        When mismatch repair genes go awry, the result is commonly colon cancer. Such genes are part of the intricate molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt;        machinery that fixes the cellular DNA when for some reason, cell replication doesnít work correctly. According to Dr.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Fishel, MSH2 and MLH1 are the most frequently altered genes in HNPCC, which accounts for some 10 to 15 percent of</i><br>
<i>&gt;        all colorectal cancers. A mismatch of the DNA nucleotides, or building blocks, may occur during cell replication. In</i><br>
<i>&gt;        replication, precise nucleotide pairing is essential. In human cells, it is a protein complex containing hMSH2 that attaches</i><br>
<i>&gt;        to mismatched nucleotides. The cellular repair machinery, with hMLH1, then orchestrates the correction of these errors.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        "Without hMSH2 or hMLH1 the cellular DNA becomes unstable, errors accumulate and the result is cancer," Dr. Fishel</i><br>
<i>&gt;        explains.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        "Now the question is, will it work in humans?" says Dr. Fishel. "We already know there is some efficacy in humans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        We didnít know why--this work at least partially answers that question."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        "This is an important step for cancer prevention in HNPCC", says Dr. Henry Lynch of Creighton University and one of</i><br>
<i>&gt;        the founders of HNPCC (also called Lynch's Syndrome). "Drs. Fishel and Rüschoff's work provides a basic research</i><br>
<i>&gt;        foundation to helping individuals with this devastating disease."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        One next step already underway is a clinical trial in Europe to study the effectiveness of higher doses of aspirin in</i><br>
<i>&gt;        preventing hereditary colorectal cancer. Dr. Lynch, Dr. Fishel, and Dr. John Burn (University of Newcastle, England</i><br>
<i>&gt;        and leader of the European Study) are currently organizing the international hereditary colorectal cancer prevention trial</i><br>
<i>&gt;        using aspirin.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        There is a downside to aspirin and sulindac: they have already been shown to harbor some gastrointestinal toxicity and</i><br>
<i>&gt;        liver toxicity, respectively. "In the future, we would like to understand the specific mechanism and the exact target for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;        genetic suppression as well as minimize the toxicity," Dr. Fishel says. "Not everyone can take aspirin. This has to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;        done the right way and in consultation with a physician."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        According to the American Cancer Society, colon and rectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the nation, with</i><br>
<i>&gt;        some 200,000 new cases diagnosed annually. Approximately 30,000 people die each year from colon and rectal cancer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Between 15-30% of colorectal cancers appear to have a hereditary origin and approximately 50% of those involve</i><br>
<i>&gt;        germline mutation of the human mismatch repair genes.</i><br>
