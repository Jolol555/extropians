<p>
I found some information on advanced dewar construction in Richard
Rhodes book "Dark Sun: the making of the Hydrogen bomb. I don't
know if the cryonics companies are aware of this or not (probably)
but I thought I'd mention it.

<p>
...Between the second, outer assembly and the dewar, the<br>
cryogenicists ingeniously interposed a single floating thermal
radiation shield-another thin walled tank, probably made of
copper...

<p>
... a thermal-radiation shield floating in a vacuum can<br>
significantly reduce radiant-heat transport from a warm exterior to
a cold interior. Without it Wechsler observes "your talking a warm
surface and a cold surface, and the temperature difference is a
couple hundred degrees Kelvin. I don't care if you've got a vacuum
between them, the heat leak into the cold surface is serious. But
theres a neat little trick. If you can put in a surface with an
intermediate temperature and float it-isolate it thermally- then
the outside surface sees the intermediate, and the inside one sees
the other side of the intermediate, and that cuts the loss way
down...

<p>
...rather than clutter the secondary with multiple floating<br>
shields, they borrowed another trick, if you can make a shield
float at a lower temperature than it normally would, Wechsler says,
than you pick up the reflectivity of fifty thermal radiation
shields. To cool the shield they welded a pan to the bottom of the
copper shield that they kept filled with liquid nitrogen.....

<p>
hope this is of use.
