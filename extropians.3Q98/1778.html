<i>&gt;</i><br>

<a name="1799qlink1"><a name="1779qlink1">I haven't read the book (I only became aware that
there was a book after following several links
from your own web site) but I read the reviews and
wondered if Tipler had specifically said this was
the Christian God. I looked it up at Amazon and
the reviewers were split between those who think
it's the ultimate satire and those who think
Tipler's trying to confuse them with physics.
Strangely, no religious persons had commented.</a></a>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tipler doesn't propose worship (other than the</i><br>

<i>&gt; the omega-development process), but his theorty</i><br>

<i>&gt; wonderful eternal life to look forward to, the</i><br>
