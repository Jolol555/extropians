<a name="2613qlink1">A problem like you are describing can be thought of as a search problem.
You want to search through a list of candidate values for one which
satisfies a certain criterion (in this case, being a CAD specification
of a spaceship, etc.).</a>

<p>
We have good information about the abilities of quantum computers with
this kind of problem.  We have a proof of the best speedups possible,
and we have an algorithm which gives that much speedup.

<p>
Generally, the answer is that the quantum computer takes the square
root of the number of operations taken by the classical computer.

<p>
<a name="2613qlink2">In your case, if your classical computer would take 2 to the power of
1 billion possibilities to calculate, the quantum computer would
take the square root of that, which means halving the exponent.  This
is 2 to the power of 500 million possibilities.</a>

<p>
This is far too many to be practical.  The number of subatomic particles
in the entire universe is something like 2 to the 300th.  If each one
of these was somehow able to function as a separate quantum computer,
your problem would still require 2 to the 499,999,700 power calculations.
