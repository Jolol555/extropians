<p>
I saw your post in the Extropians archives, and I thought 
you might appreciate an invitation to try a free 
subscription to our list, MAPS-Forum. MAPS and the Extropy 
Institute have more than a few objectives in common. We 
also have many of the best writers in the psychedelic 
field contributing to the Forum, including many 
Extropians. This moderated list has a LOW volume and a 
HIGH signal-to-noise ratio. I hope you will consider 
joining us, as your participation and support could make 
an important difference.
<br>
Sincerely Yours,

MAPS-Forum is the moderated news and discussion list of the
Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPA) MAPS is a 501
<br>
(c) (3) corporation chartered in 1986 as a membership-based research and<br>
educational organization. Currently numbering 1600 members, MAPS pursues
its mission by helping scientific researchers design, obtain governmental
approval for, fund, conduct and report on psychedelic research in human
volunteers. Topics may include current news, book reviews, factual
questions about psychedelics or marijuana, psychedelics and marijuana in
the media, ideas for research and fundraising, and articles in the MAPS
quarterly bulletin/newsletter. Students who have written class papers on
psychedelic topics are encouraged to share their work here. M.D. and Ph.D.
researchers funded by MAPS are also asked to participate. To maintain the
high standards that members expect from MAPS, this is a moderated list.
Subscribers to maps-forum are assured of a high signal/noise ratio. A
maximum of five messages are selected for posting to the list each day by
the moderator. Although questions are welcome at all levels of interest,
the moderator prefers posted comments to be presented at a level
appropriate for a classroom or a professional meeting.

Albert Einstein wrote that "Imagination is more important 
than knowledge." If you can even faintly imagine a 
cultural reintegration of the use of psychedelics and the 
states of mind they engender, please consider joining MAPS 
in supporting the expansion of scientific knowledge in 
this area. Progress is possible with the support of 
individuals who care enough to take individual and 
collective action.
