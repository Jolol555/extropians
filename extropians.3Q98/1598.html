I for one was bookish then and am bookish now. I also took every
form of shop available when I was in high school (Lane Tech
Chicago) and won an award for "best in class" for machine shop for

 I have played almost every sport you can name, although the only
regular possible sport I still participate in is the occasional
sailing jaunt, and my thrice weekly trip to the weight room.

 I was an Aircraft electrician in the Marines, my degree's in
biology, and am a Union Electrician currently (10 years) working as
a network engineer for Ameritech, the midwest RBOC.

I also write the occasional Haiku:

                         and now the tea
                         enjoying life sip by sip
                         nothing is better
