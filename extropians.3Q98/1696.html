<i>&gt; Uh, how? It's all very well to talk about "programming copies" and</i><br>

<i>&gt; as to how to program a neural network or assimilate parts of one into</i><br>

<p>
mark is right. if the copy is exact, it will not work as planned knowing that it
</a>
<a name="1707qlink5">will be destroyed, any less than you will blow your own head off</a> during vacation.
<a name="1707qlink6">again, i also see a problem with the duplicate that knows you've made</a> a program
<a name="1707qlink7">that deletes it after 8 hours. a system clause would have to be included</a> in the
<a name="1707qlink8">duplicate, something much like a hypnotic command that the duplicate</a> is unaware
<a name="1707qlink9">of. if anyone takes care of the problem with programming neural networks,</a> i'll
<a name="1707qlink10">figure out how to set the 'destruct timer' in the meantime. ;)

<a href="1693.html#1696qlink2">&gt; On this subject, I'm toying with a low-budget movie idea about the real</a><br>
<i>&gt; perils of duplication (i.e. that the copies are exact duplicates of you</i><br>
<i>&gt; and won't do all those neat things you planned); does anyone know of any</i><br>
<i>&gt; movies which have handled this properly in the past? That is, where</i><br>
<i>&gt; the duplicates really are exact duplicates rather than different versions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the same person? Everything I can think of seems to have gone the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'Jekyll and Hyde' route.             Mark.</i><br>

<p>
a movie with michael keaton came up some 2 or 3 years ago with this theme,</a> can't
<a name="1707qlink11">remember the title i'm afraid. for the funniest stories about the subject,</a> try
<a name="1707qlink12">out the old issues of 'calvin and hobbes'. calvin made duplicates</a> to make his
<a name="1707qlink13">homework for him and well..., you can imagine the rest.

<p>
maybe what we need to make uploading work is to make the duplicates</a> more perfect
<a name="1707qlink14">than us. e.g. 'would we trust our work to be done by ourselves?'
