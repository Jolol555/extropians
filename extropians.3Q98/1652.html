<a href="1647.html#1652qlink1">&gt; I can't believe this is happening. Its like the Bill Clinton situation </a><br>
<i>&gt; on the Extropian list. Yesterday I posted about how Erik Moeller's posts </i><br>
<i>&gt; had been deleted from the current list archive. After my post appeared </i><br>
<i>&gt; the archive was suddenly unavailable. Its still unavailable but the 1996 </i><br>
<i>&gt; archive is fine. If the Moeller posts reappear when the archive returns </i><br>
<i>&gt; and the people that administer this list claim the posts were always </i><br>
<i>&gt; there that will be an OUTRIGHT LIE. I know what I saw. The Moeller posts </i><br>
<i>&gt; were gone. When I sorted the list by authors Erik did not even show up </i><br>
<i>&gt; on the list! I am appalled by the censoring and if deception occurs that </i><br>
<i>&gt; will appall me also.</i><br>

Whoa there, hard charger. What you KNOW may not be as right as you think.
I don't handle the archives (all of the list and list archive stuff is
handled by David McFadzean), but I have very recently done searches myself
for people I KNEW were in there (I was looking for a couple email addresses
for people I knew posted to the list frequently), and I didn't find them 
in my author search either. Consider, just for a moment, the possibility that
there was something wrong with that part of the archiving system.
