Conversely, the more irrational the proponents, the 
more dramatic the implications they will see.  So dramatic
claims need not be a strong clue as to who is wrong.

<p>
But do they see your lack of information as the reason you fail
to see why you're wrong?  And if so, shouldn't you admit maybe
they know something you don't?  It's just plain irrational to 
agree to disagree because you each know something the other 
doesn't.

This sounds very "scientific," as practiced in academia.
For something that seems weird, academics presume it's bunk 
until evidence is presented in its favor, rather than presuming
it's right until skeptics give evidence that it's wrong.
