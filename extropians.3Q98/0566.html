I see what you mean, but consider: for a gene to became widespread it
generally must confer a net reproductive advantage; which means that male
homosexuality is more than a "suppressed glitch".  Societal tolerance of
deviant sexual behavior has been a rare thing throughout history--this is
the memetic environment in which this genetic trait evolved.  It's our new
"liberal" memetic environment which has turned what used to be an advantage
into a fatal "glitch".

<p>
To wrench this discursion rudely back in the direction of the original
topic: I suspect that many of the behaviors that modern society has a
problem with have the same basis, i.e. they are strategies which evolved by
conferring advantage in a different environment (memetic and otherwise),
but which have turned into fatal flaws today.  Tomorrow might see them once
again valuable, however, so maybe we should be thinking in terms of
preserving behavioral diversity....
