michael, i should have been clearer in my explanation, but i was trying tokeep my
</a>
<a name="1376qlink4">response very short.  when i saw the proposal that the roton was
to use the blades to help launch, i thought the writer must be joking.</a>  my reasoning
<a name="1376qlink5">goes thus:  if one tries to use the roton blades in the launch phase,</a> one could at
<a name="1376qlink6">best get to an altitude of, well, what?  10 kilometers?  our</a> best helicopters cannot
<a name="1376qlink7">get as high as the highest peak, everest, less than 9 km.  no chopper rescues
possible for climbers there.

the key point is, if one starts at zero velocity at the outer</a> edge atmosphere,
<a name="1376qlink8">surprisingly, one is
<br>
not appreciably closer to being in earth orbit than if one starts out</a> on the deck.
this is
<br>
<a name="1376qlink9">true.  lets just say the lowest possible orbit is at 100 km,</a> a verrrry short lived
orbit.  if

required to
<br>
