Why should they want to get bodies? Apart from intrinsically higher

computer cluster or a Jupiter brain is not a suitable environment 
for any classical body. Why limiting oneself to human senses if I 
can utilize anything from proximal probe over accelerometry, 
magnetometry, MS, particle detectors, inteferometry arrays, &amp;c&amp;c? 
Exercise your own imagination on the motorics part. But, once again, 
if the material realm of a stellar system is entirely under your 
control, maxing out on computation while keeping the number of 
resources allocated to sensomotorics at an absolute mininimum (in a
pinch, you could always reuse these atoms in new configurations albeit 
at a time penalty and resources wasted in dormant basal autoreplicator 
capability) is obviously a good strategy. Only coevolution-artefacted
nonlinearities would seem to disturb the Brave New Postmaterial 
world scheme. (Of course, as this is way PostSingularity, we're off 
exploring the Neverneverextrapolation-land again. Pray don't knock 
down the lametta, the ultraviolet bunnies hate that).

Thank you, I'd rather be a cluster of active-orbit-controlled 
boxes in high solar orbit swinging around my own gravitation center,
while other parts of me are busily processing our stellar
neighbourhood. (Of course there will be probably no 'me', just a memetic 
bouillabaisse (sp?) virtually swirling in diverse bitbuckets of multiple 
shapes and sizes).

Nanotechnology strong enough to allow autoreplication by
mechanosynthesis is actually unnecessary for uploading, in a pinch we
could settle with vanilla molecular circuitry/macroscopic autoreplicators.
Since the plumbing layer is not visible in artificial reality, this
should not concern us too much (but it would be less pretty, agreed).
See Joe Strout's pages for details.

If drextech is feasible, a way of producing living tissue and whole
living critters would seem to build a beasty in vitrified state around 
a fractal diamondoid channel/scaffolding network, then flash-devitrify 
it into life by pumping energy into the network and dissipating it
more or less uniformly, then retracting/breaking down the
scaffolding. Of course even if we do it very gently, it will give the 
homo novus more than a case of sore throat, but it should be
survivable, especially if we allow for a bit of anaesthesized 
regeneration. See no point in it, though. Bodies are out of fashion.
