<a href="1828.html#1877qlink2">&gt;&gt;This seems to me to be a pretty clear reversal, since you</a><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But these are not copies and I'm not talking about subtitles</i><br>
<i>&gt;here, the mental state of the two are astronomically different.</i><br>

<p>
It seems to me that *any* mental state that a 
person is capable of reaching in less than
a day must be fairly similar to those she had
a day ago.  The bare surface of current thought
may seem radically different, but that alone is 
not enough to make a different person, is it?

<i>&gt;&gt;One of the fundamental premises of uploading is accepting</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;all relevant physical processes of your mind is preserved.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;method.</i><br>

<p>
I would say that continuity of experience is also 
important here, though.
