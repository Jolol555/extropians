           The Advanced Bonewits' Cult Danger Evaluation Frame 2.0

                                         Introduction

</pre>
<p>
  Events in the last few decades have clearly indicated just how 
dangerous some religious and secular
<br>
 groups (usually called "cults" by those opposed to them) can be to 
their own members as well as to
<br>
 anyone else whom they can influence. "Brainwashing," beatings, 
child abuse, rapes, murders, mass
<br>
 suicides, military drilling and gunrunning, meddling in civil 
governments, international terrorism, and
 other crimes have been charged against leaders and members of 
many groups, and in far too many
<br>
 cases those accusations have been correct. None of this has been 
very surprising to historians of
<br>
 religion or to other scholars of what are usually labled "new" 
religions (no matter how old they may be
 in their cultures of origin). Minority groups, especially religious 
ones, are often accused of crimes by
<br>
 members of the current majority. In many ways, for example, the 
"Mormons" were the "Moonies" of
<br>
 the 19th century -- at least in terms of being an unusual minority 
belief system that many found
<br>
 "shocking" at the time -- and the members of the Unification Church 
could be just as "respectable" a
<br>
 hundred years from now as the Latter Day Saints are today.
  

<p>
 Nonetheless, despite all the historical and philosophical caveats that 
could be issued, ordinary people
<br>
 faced with friends or loved ones joining an "unusual" group, or 
perhaps contemplating joining it
<br>
 themselves, need a relatively simple way to evaluate just how 
dangerous or harmless a given group is
<br>
 liable to be, without either subjecting themselves to its power or 
judging it solely on theological or
<br>
 ideological grounds (the usual method used by anti-cult groups).
  

<p>
 In 1979 I constructed an evaluation tool which I now call the 
"Advanced Bonewits' Cult Danger
<br>
 Evaluation Frame," or the "ABCDEF," a copy of which was 
included in that year's revised edition of
 my book, Real Magic (Samuel Weiser Pub., 1989). I realize its 
shortcomings, but feel that it can be
<br>
 effectively used to separate harmless groups from the merely 
unusual-to-the-observer ones. Feedback
<br>
 from those attempting to use the system has always been 
appreciated. Indirect feedback, in terms of
 the number of places on and off the Net this ABCDEF has shown 
up, has been mostly favorable. For
<br>
 example, it was chosen by and is now displayed on the website of 
the Institute for Social Inventions,
<br>
 who paraphrased it for their "Best Ideas -- A compendium of social 
innovations" listing.
  

<p>
 The purpose of this evaluation tool is to help both amateur and 
professional observers, including
<br>
 current or would-be members, of various organizations (including 
religious, occult, psychological or
<br>
 political groups) to determine just how dangerous a given group is 
liable to be, in comparison with
<br>
 other groups, to the physical and mental health of its members and 
of other people subject to its
<br>
 influence. It cannot speak to the spiritual "dangers," if any, that 
might be involved, for the simple
<br>
 reason that one person's path to enlightenment or "salvation" is 
often viewed by another as a path to
<br>
 ignorance or "damnation."
  

<p>
 As a general rule, the higher the numerical total scored by a given 
group (the further to the right of the
<br>
 scale), the more dangerous it is likely to be. Though it is obvious 
that many of the scales in the frame
<br>
 are subjective, it is still possible to make practical judgments using 
it, at least of the "is this group more
<br>
 dangerous than that one?" sort. This is if all numerical assignments 
are based on accurate and unbiased
<br>
 observation of actual behavior by the groups and their top levels of 
leadership (as distinct from
<br>
 official pronouncements). This means that you need to pay 
attention to what the secondary and tertiary
 leaders are saying and doing, as much (or more so) than the 
central leadership -- after all, "plausible
 deniability" is not a recent historical invention.
  

<p>
 This tool can be used by parents, reporters, law enforcement 
agents, social scientists and others
<br>
 interested in evaluating the actual dangers presented by a given 
group or movement. Obviously,
<br>
 different observers will achieve differing degrees of precision, 
depending upon the sophistication of
<br>
 their numerical assignments on each scale. However, if the same 
observers use the same methods of
<br>
 scoring and weighting each scale, their comparisons of relative 
danger or harmlessness between
<br>
 groups will be reasonably valid, at least for their own purposes. 
People who cannot, on the other
<br>
 hand, view competing belief systems as ever having possible 
spiritual value to anyone, will find the
 ABCDEF annoyingly useless for promoting their theocratic 
agendas. Worse, these members of the
<br>
 Religious Reich will find that their own organizations (and quite a 
few large mainstream churches) are
<br>
 far more "cult-like" than the minority belief systems they so bitterly 
oppose.
  

<p>
 It should be pointed out that the ABCDEF is founded upon both 
modern psychological theories about
<br>
 mental health and personal growth, and my many years of 
participant observation and historical
<br>
 research into minority belief systems. Those who believe that 
relativism and anarchy are as dangerous
<br>
 to mental health as absolutism and authoritarianism, could (I 
suppose) count groups with total scores
<br>
 nearing either extreme (high or low) as being equally hazardous. As 
far as dangers to physical
<br>
 well-being are concerned, however, both historical records and 
current events clearly indicate the
<br>
 direction in which the greatest threats lie. This is especially so 
since the low-scoring groups usually
<br>
 seem to have survival and growth rates so small that they seldom 
develop the abilities to commit large
<br>
 scale atrocities even had they the philosophical or political 
inclinations to do so.
