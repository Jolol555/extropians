Please, do.  Thin skins don't last very long around here.  I don't take
any objections personally.  As long as you don't call me stupid, feel
free to call my ideas stupid.

Very good question!  I was being very sloppy in my wording, and poorly
expressing my belief that someday we will be able to duplicate
everything the brain does.

<p>
I stand corrected that neurons cannot duplicate brain function.  Between
the neurons are neurotransmitter chemicals which carry messages.
Besides duplicating neurons, we would also have to simulate a chemical
communications network between neurons and learn to encode and decode
the chemical messages.  We also have to simulate the competition of
neurochemicals for receptor sites, and simulate the rate of transmission
success and loss, including thresholds.

<p>
This is much more complicated than my flippant remark about replacing
neurons would really indicate.  We either have to simulate chemical
reactions so that the neurons can interpret the results, or we have to
crack the coding of these chemical messages so that the meanings of the
messages themselves can be simulated.

<p>
You are right that the wet chemicals also have to be simulated, and not
just the neurons.  The neurons might be data flags, but we still need
software and messaging systems to access these data states.  There also
are different thresholds for neurons firing, based on various chemical
levels.  Neurons are not binary, either on or off.  We may even have to
simulate limited chemical availability, just like in the real human
brain.  If we make the simulated chemicals unlimited, would this
overload the software or have a jamming effect as every neuron fires
continuously?

<p>
You are totally correct that replacing every neuron is simplistic.  We
do have to duplicate the wetware, either with chemicals or full
simulations.
