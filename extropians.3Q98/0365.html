Our core value -- becoming posthumans -- is only part of 
transhumanism. Just as important are our ideas of how it can be 
achieved. Obviously, many people in the past have wanted to overcome 
their biological limitations and achieve immortality; but they 
haven't known how to go about it. Transhumanism is the first 
philosophy ever to have both the goal of transcending the human 
condition and the practical, technological means to make it happen. I 
think that is quite revolutionary.

I believe we have only seen the beginning. As the amount of 
brainpower involved in transhumanism increases, the intensity of 
<a name="0367qlink1">intellectual exploration of transhumanist issues will reach new 
levels that will make most of what is being said today look very 
crude and unsophisticated.

For a recent step forward, take for example David Brin's reframing of 
the whole privacy debate.</a>
