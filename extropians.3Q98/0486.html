This illustrates an all too common phenenomenon.

<p>
I'm fully convinced that the news media no longer reports the news.  If it
ever did.  What the news media does is attempt to influence public opinion.
<a name="0496qlink1">And since new news media is rabidly anti gun it's not difficult to imagine
what they will report or how they will report</a> it.

<p>
I think they'd probably blatantly lie to advance their cause.  Make up news
stories to support it. . Reference the CNN nerve gas stories.  And for a
historical perspective to illustrate how long this has been going on how about
Hearst and the Spanish American War?

<p>
I know that they will mischarterisze in a heartbeat...a personal example is
that I was in that little town in Arkansaw...(hillsboro?) just prior to the
first of the nationallly acclaimed "kids shooting kids"....

<p>
It looks nothing like the news media makes it out to be..  Just a medium size
town is all.
