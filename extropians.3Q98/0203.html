Let's use some method. In order to improve the image of 
transhumanism, we need to identify what the weak points are and how 
they could be strengthened.

<p>
This suggests a nice two-phase project: (1) find out what the most 
common questions/objections are; (2) develop some good ways of 
answering them.

<p>
Let's begin with (1). I will make a list of the five most common 
questions/objections that I have encountered when presenting 
transhumanist ideas to outsiders. Could other people here who have a 
som eexperience in talking about transhumanism please do likewise, 
and send these lists of five to me (n.bostrom@lse.ac.uk). This should 
be very easy and just take a minute or two. I will classify the 
objections and count their frequency and post the results back to 
this list. That will naturally lead on to step (2).
