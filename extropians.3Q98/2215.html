<a name="2227qlink1">I have grown tired of waiting for Max to show up.</a>

<p>
Is Extropy really an institute ?

<p>
The clock is ticking.

<p>
I want answers.

<p>
<a name="2266qlink4">I am still waiting for that apology.
<br>
I am 100 % serious. I want an apology from
the Extropy Insititute and I had better get one.

<p>
What the hell did Extropy think it was playing at
attempting to blame me for the 

<p>
ARCHIVE DELETIONS WITH THE C WORD IN 
<br>
THEM. 
</a>

<p>
I didn't even know they existed until someone else
brought the matter to the lists attention. 

<p>
Do you think the rest of the world does not apply to
you or something ? Think again. It is people like you
who are making transhumanists look like a bunch
of cultists. I for one am sick to death of this "Extropy"
bullshit. You think the law does not apply to you.
Well I will use that exact same logic in dealing with
you. Use your imagination.

<p>
I suggest you think long and hard before ever 
doing anything like that again. You might be able
to bully academics on this list but I think you 
will have some serious problems from now on.

<p>
What exactly is the official statement on that
hush hush let's all sweep it under the rug affair ?
Or did you blame it all on the FEDS : )

<p>
I can wait forever if necessary.

<p>
This conspiracy of silence is pathetic and futile.

<p>
Extropy really is a rum outfit. Very unprofessional.
I have my doubts about it being an institute. I am
starting to think it is something else completely
different.

<p>
If you think that I am going to go away think again.
If you think that if you keep quiet long enough I will
start howling like a wolf think again.

<p>
Well Max I have to go now. I am trying to grow an
Extropy garden. I also asked at the local gardening 
store for some Extropy seeds but they said that they 
had never heard of Extropy. Extropy can be grow 
can't it ? 

<p>
Ground control to major Max Section 8 More....

<p>
P.S

<p>
I suggest you respond.
