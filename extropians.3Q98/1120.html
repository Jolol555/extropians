<p>
&gt;some of us use memetic replicators...

<p>
<a href="1097.html#1120qlink1">&gt; Other examples of antagonistic memetic replicators are "nigger, kike, geek,</a><br>
<i>&gt; redneck, ......truckdriver"...the list goes on and on...</i><br>

<p>
it takes the sting out of antagonistic memetic replicators ifthe intended
antagonizee turns it around and carries the title proudly.  the
most effective example of this i can think of is the homosexual community
and the term "queer", by naming a gay organization "queer nation".

<p>
the racially charged memetic replicators, such as the famous n word
we heard so much during the  oj simpson trial, are never effectively
co-opted.  counterexample?  i have called myself a computer geek many
times, yet no one thought i was referring to eating live animals.  i have
been known to devour sushi with great enthusiam however... {8^D  spike
