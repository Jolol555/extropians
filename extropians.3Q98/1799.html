i haven't read the book either, but the religious people i know praise
it highly because it does support eternal life. funny thing is i believe
i actually have the book somewhere, not sure if i'll get around to read
it anytime soon though. eternal life becomes boring after a while (more
than enough litterature on the subject as it is)

<p>
not probable, the known universe was coded before microsoft was founded.
it seems to run on a fairly stabile os...

<p>

<p>
sounds dangerous, wouldn't we end up with all matter in one place,
making way for even more planetary coalitions? i think the alternative
we're looking for is more like 'bending space' and/or space/time holes.
haven't quite figured out the way to do it yet, but i gather that your
grav pull machine isn't quite finished yet either. ;)
