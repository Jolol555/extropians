i figure cryonics is a longshot, but better than no shot or a bunch
of empty soothing promises from the religionists.  suppose one has
emphasema.  with this curse, one knows exactly what ones last
months are to be like.  quality of life goes to zero, then negative,
weeks before the last gasp.

<p>
((squick alert:))  is it possible to have one's head transplanted onto
the body of a chimp?  of course one would be quadruplegic, but at
least one could breathe and communicate as dr steven hawking does.

<p>
 would not one's chances of ever being revived be greatly increased if
one were frozen while still alive, and bio-ram undamaged from
persistent lack of oxygen?  since the government frowns
on the practice of freezing while alive, why not transplant your
gasping head onto the chimp's body, then almost immediately, before
the immune response starts, freeze the whole thing?  then cut
away the nonhuman parts (scalpel...clamp...buzzsaw... {8^D ) and
you have it.  a frozen head with, presumably, the software still
in there waiting for technology to bring it back to life.

<p>
has the chimp path to cryonics already been explored?  where?
