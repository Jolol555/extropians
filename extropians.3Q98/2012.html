Does this mean you find no utility for survival in uploading?

<p>
What I called the "fuzzy area of identity" and your calling the
"design space of Joe Jenkins" is by no means all possible states that
my biological brain can be in as allowed for by the recipe of my
genetics.  See below. 

<p>
<a href="1952.html#2012qlink3">&gt; I don't see why you treat hardware so</a><br>
<i>&gt; differently from software and if you define anything within that</i><br>
<i>&gt; design space to be you it can lead to places you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to go.</i><br>

<p>
The primary utility of the Universal Turing Machine is to demonstrate
the irrelevance of hardware.  Above, I've used it to throw hardware
completely out of the equation.<a name="2019qlink1">  Your thought experiment, that I've
omitted here, about my biological twin brother shows you have missed
my point completely.</a>  The fuzzy area of identity is bounded by what my
ego would<a name="2019qlink2"> perceive as me, not by all the states my biological brain
could achieve as dictated by my genes.</a>  Because the hardware and
software of the brain are both moving targets, it is useful to lump
them together in the design space I've defined above.  

<p>
At the center of the fuzzy area of identity is my "True Identity"
which consist of a single point at any given instant.  A line can be
drawn in the design space that represents my true identity from the
time I was an infant up to now.  The fuzzy area of identity would
certainly not include all the points in that line and yet it would
include points near my true identity that have not and most likely
never will be realized.<a name="2019qlink3">  Under normal circumstances I'd say the fuzzy
area in my identity line would be from 5 years to one month ago.</a>  That
is, anything less than a month would be clearly identified as me,
anything more than 5 years would be clearly identified and not me, and
everything in between would be considered fuzzy.  Depending on the
individual and what's happening in their life, I would expect this to
vary widely.

<p>
Thought experiment, "Non-Destructive Backup Technology":

<p>
<a name="2034qlink2">Lets say a non-destructive backup technology becomes available in
2010.  This technology allow us to place a subject on a MRI-like table
and rotate his head while a stationary light source generates short
bursts of photons.  A sensor on the other side of the subjects head is
able to register only the photons arriving first that passed through
the brain without any collisions whatsoever.  The photons that collide
with brain matter arrive too late and are not part of the image
created for that pulse of light because they had to bounce once or
twice and thus travel further and thus take longer to exit the other
side of the brain.  The head is slowly rotated and a series</a> of images
(one for each pulse is recorded).  At an atomic scale, human flesh is
mostly empty space and matter is the exception rather than the rule. 
A multitude of images are accumulated to represent the head being
rotated 360 degrees.  These images are now processed to determine a
record of where all matter in the brain is located.  A three
dimensional image is resolved representing every axiom, dentride,
neuro transmitter/receptor etc.  The final output product of this
system is a 400 terabyte compressed file that is handed over to the
subject on non-volatile holographic memory and backed up in a central
data base.  Most middle income individuals find they can afford this
procedure every two weeks.  Because of the four hours required for the
procedure even wealthy individuals find it practical only once every
two weeks.  In the year 2012 full resolution emulation of these files
is possible including interfaces to highly realistic artificial
reality systems.  The singularity still seems to be 10 years away.  AI
that is not derived from uploads is yet unrealized. 

<p>
To me this is the greatest invention in all history.  I now consider
myself immortal.  I return to my hang gliding hobby without a worry in
the world.  I find myself on a  troubled Jet traveling with Mr. Clark
and Mr. Randall.<a name="2019qlink4">  We are in a three minute non recoverable free fall
headed strait for assured destruction with the ground.  All three of
us did a backup procedure last week.  Mr. Randall is shitting his
pants, Mr. Clark is trembling and sweating and believe it or not,
praying.  I'm looking at these guys, laughing my head off, completely
entertained by this whole thing.</a>  I decide one minute of watching
these guys lose-it is enough fun for one day.  Much more entertaining,
would be to jump out the exit door and enjoy a little free-flight on
the way down.  Weeeeeeeeee this is fun.  Those guys need to get a
grip.  What say you?

<p>
<a name="2020qlink1"><a name="2013qlink1">Where do others stand on this list?  So far, it seems I'm the only one
on the list with this idea of identity.  If I'm the only one on this
list, I'm probably the only one in the world.  What a lonely and cold
feeling it is to be the sole resident of this memetic fitness bump.</a> 
<a name="2020qlink2">What are you guys selecting for anyway?  Anyone want to party at my
place?</a></a>
