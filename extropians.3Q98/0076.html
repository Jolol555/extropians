<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually as I recall, in the informal, unscientific, anonymous survey I took on</i><br>
<i>&gt; this list this past winter, those who admitted to gun ownership out numbered</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who admitted to non-gun ownership by 2 to 1, and if you included those who</i><br>

<i>&gt; me privately on the issue, around 70-75% were 'pro-gun'.</i><br>

<a name="0174qlink1">I suppose that if you did the same test on the transhuman mailing list,
or on ExI-Euro, the results would be somewhat different. Europeans tend
to be rather gun-phobic. It's probably linked to the popularity of
socialism etc, in which the criminal is just a "poor victim of society",
blah, blah, and should be given a better treatment than those annoying
(real) victims. Oh yes, they *hate* the victims, maybe because they
remind them of how the world *really*</a> is.

<a name="0174qlink2"><a href="0044.html#0076qlink2">&gt; Since Prof. John Lott's research of FBI crime stats over many years has shown</a><br>
<i>&gt; that gun ownerhip conclusively reduces the incidence of crime, while most other</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'less well considered' policies tend to increase or have no effect on crime,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that gun ownership is an important extropian theme.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0080qlink2">It certainly is. Guns are very useful pieces of technology. By carrying
a gun (and training yourself in it's use) you empower yourself
considerably, having an edge over most thugs you encounter. Objectively
speaking, a gun is a great transhuman tool, but get's discriminated
against because it's related to a "touchy" subject (killing people).
Personally, I wouldn't lose any sleep over shooting an (armed) attacker.
