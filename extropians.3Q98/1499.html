<a name="1530qlink1">Why am I going to apologize to Max? I'll give Shaun a cheerleader award 
but I certainly won't apologize to Max.</a> Max was clearly hypocritical on 
this list. I called him on it. He can't handle it. What am I supposed to 
do? He continues to be hypocritical by insulting me because I chose not 
to use my real name. I've yet to see him do the same to Tom Morrow. And 
no I have nothing against Tom Morrow. The difference is I say things Max 
does not agree with. He can't handle it so he attacks me. He did the 
same my Erik Moeller. Max tried to villainize me because many of my 
posts are critical. Yeah I'm a critical person. The glass is half-empty 
and that kinda stuff. That doesn't make me a bad person or someone who 
should be castigated.

<p>
I've just been making observations. None of them have been conjured up 
from la-la land. Everyone else has seen what happened with that thread. 
Anyway...
