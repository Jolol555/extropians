&lt;&lt; I also hate to be techno-pesimistic, but this is *rockets* you are talking
 about.  So, I'd like to point out that Gary Hudson has been involved in
 many, many rocket projects, all failures.  I applaud his determination.  In
 my opinion, he is a brilliant salesman, and can attract funding to any
 rocket project at all.  Since his job in this curent endevour is not a
 technical one, I am sure he is an asset to the project.  In my opinion, all
 of his technical ideas of the past were doomed due to a lack of respect for
 simplicity, and I am not speaking out of hindsight.  For that matter, most
 space launch projects suffer the same problem.
