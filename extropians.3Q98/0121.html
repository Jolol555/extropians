 There is a feedback loop at work, though perhaps
 not of the sort you imagine.  Here is how it works,
 over a cycle of 5-10 years:  Legislators pass new
 gun control laws in the name of preventing crime;
 crime increases due to the lesser availability of
 guns to potential victims; legislators cry over
 towering crime rates and pass more gun legislation.
 In general, it seems that if you feel that people
 are generally more apt to use a gun to defend
 themselves against crime than to commit it,
 you favor proliferation of guns.  If you feel that
 people in general are only waiting for firepower
 to commit as many crimes as they can, you
 favor gun laws.
