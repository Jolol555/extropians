&lt;&lt; But for the rest of us, so what? Just move away from the people who are
 likely to be nuked and hope you avoid the odd random crazies. It's no
 big deal for those who don't want to boss others around. Unless Y2K takes
 the government down then DC probably will be nuked in the next couple 
 of decades. So what?

suffering that could be caused requires more than a "so what?" response.
