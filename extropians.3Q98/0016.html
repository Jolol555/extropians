Yes, getting into space, and putting some distance between yourself and
the earth asap seems like the only practical solution there is. Apart
from the island project (which is the only alternative as long as you
can't afford to get offplanet), it might also be a good idea to start
saving for a space ship. ;-) The chance that things will go badly</a> wrong
within the next (half)century is too big for comfort. Certainly if you
consider that it was already touch and go when only a handful of
superpowers (considerably more stable than lone nuts/terrorists) had
access to weapons of mass destruction. It's a shame Artemis and such
will probably lead to nothing.
