Given your stand on identity and survival, it is still unclear to me
what survival utility you find in such a technology - and also what
survival utility you find in destructive upload technology.

<p>
I know you've been consistent here.  At first, I was a little confused
because I had always assumed the characters in your fiction (about
copying and uploading) were portrayals of irrational people - not
yourself.  It seems clear now that you were portraying your own
position which, given your stand on the issues of identity, is not
irrational.

<p>
<a name="2049qlink1">In addition to John, I pose the following questions to anyone on the
list who wants to respond:

<p>
<a name="2069qlink1"><a name="2065qlink1">If non-destructive technology were available, would you choose</a> to
upload<a name="2065qlink2"> and keep your biological self alive or terminate</a></a></a> it?

<p>
<a name="2049qlink2">If you choose to keep your biological self alive.  Would you not
expect that eventually after many augmentations that biological/cyborg
self would see the limitations and inefficiency of living in the
physical world and want to upload into Homodigititus himself?</a>

<p>
<a name="2049qlink3">If yes, would you want this process to terminate the biological/cyborg?</a>

<p>
If no, would you not expect that after sufficient divergence that that
biological/cyborg self would not feel the pressure of being a massive
resource wasting relic of the past because of his (living in the
physical world) status and want to upload himself?

<p>
If yes, do you not see a problem with this infinitely repeating cycle?

<p>
Then do you see some sort of logic in the madness?

<p>
<a name="2069qlink2">Or, do you think there will always be a place in the
physical/non-uploaded world for sentient beings on the forefront of
posthuman competitiveness?</a>  Of course, I'm not trying to imply that
eventually nothing will exist in the physical world.  And I do
recognize the importance of probes and sensors connected to uploaders
in real-time.  But, I see artificial reality as being the place of
choice for all the movers and shakers of Posthumanity.  I think
manipulation of the physical world will be mostly automated with
little real-time involvement from sentient beings of the Posthuman
rank.  Thus, I see the above cycle as eventually coming to a halt as
the biological/cyborg realizes the error of his ways.
