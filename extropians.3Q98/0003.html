&gt; remotely controlled gunboat? Quite doable for the robotics guys in the<br>
&gt; transhuman community, I reckon. <br>

At which point they call in their treaty obligations with some
major power who come over and blow the shit out of you.

<i>&gt; Unlike in any regular country, you can use</i><br>

&gt; be arrested afterwards.<br>

<p>
What you are saying is that your new country will declare war on
any other country which bothers it. This is what treaties are
for. You'd last a week.

 
<p>
<i>&gt; Last but not least: because you're *at least* 200 miles from anywhere,</i><br>

<i>&gt; and kick your ass. Small countries simply don't have the means to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; it, and big ones likely won't be interested And *should* they cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; trouble after all, they're as vulnerable as anyone to retaliatory</i><br>
<i>&gt; attacks (with for example the plague, anthrax, nerve gas or something</i><br>
&gt; more subtle) by the surviving islanders/their comrades in other<br>
&gt; countries. Only one needs to get trough...<br>

<p>
Oh sure, that'll keep them off your back.....
