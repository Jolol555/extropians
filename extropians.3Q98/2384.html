Accepting Nominations for the 1998 Foresight Institute Distinguished Student
Award

<p>
The Foresight Institute Distinguished Student award provides a $1500 grant
to the college graduate or undergraduate student whose work is deemed most
notable in advancing the development and understanding of nanotechnology.
The award will be presented at the 1998 Foresight Institute Conference on
Molecular Nanotechnology, held on November 12-15 in Santa Clara, California.
The winner will be selected by John Michelsen of Zyvex LLC, winner of the
first 1996 Distinguished Student Award, with consultation from the Foresight
Board of Directors.

<p>
Please send in your nominations to the Foresight Institute by September
25th. Nominations should include name, educational institution, mailing
address, telephone number, and email address of the nominee, as well as a
paper, electronic, or web document describing the work for which the student
is being nominated. If you are nominating someone else, please include your
own contact information as well. Nominations should be sent to:

<p>
The winner will be selected by October 9, to allow them to make arrangements
to attend the 1998 Conference.

<p>
The award, provided for the next three years through the generosity of
computer industry entrepreneur Jim Von Ehr of Zyvex LLC., and Ravi Pandya of
IECommerce Inc., is intended primarily to enable the winning student to
attend Foresight Institute's Conference on Molecular Nanotechnology, which
is held annually to bring together leaders in nanotechnology research.

<p>
The Sixth Foresight Conference on Molecular Nanotechnology is scheduled for
Nov. 12-15 in Santa Clara, CA. The keynote speaker will be Professor Steven
Chu of Stanford University, winner of the 1997 Nobel Prize for Physics.

<p>
The Foresight Institute Distinguished Student Award institutionalizes the
first grant made in 1996 by Foresight to John M. Michelsen, a University of
California at Irvine chemistry student. Michelsen's work, "Atomically
Precise, 3D Organic Nanofabrication: Reactive Lattice Subunit Design for
Inverse AFM/STM Positioning," is described on the World Wide Web at
<a href="http://www.zyvex.com/John/page1.html">http://www.zyvex.com/John/page1.html</a>

<p>
Nanotechnology is an emerging technology based on the ability to assemble
individual molecules and atoms into precise structures. Its realization will
allow the construction of supercomputers the size of a sugar cube,
pollution-free manufacturing, super-strength materials, and molecular-scale
robots capable of repairing damage in individual human cells. More than one
billion such nanorobots could fit inside a single drop of blood.

<p>
Foresight Institute is a not-for-profit corporation whose goal is to guide
emerging technologies to improve the human condition. Foresight focuses its
efforts upon nanotechnology and upon systems that will enhance knowledge
exchange and critical discussion, thus improving public and private policy
decisions.
