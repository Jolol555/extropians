seems to me that if you're going to spend your life opposing something, as 
creationists do, it might be worthwhile to spend 5 minutes studying what 
you're opposing. I first ran into this phenomena when I heard a fundamentalist
biology "expert" say he had ironclad proof Darwin was wrong, Jews he said had 
practiced circumcision for thousands of years yet the foreskin on newly born 
Jewish babies was just as long as on non Jews. The poor boob didn't know as 
every freshman biology student does, that it was Darwin himself who put the 
last nail in the coffin for Lamarckism, the idea of the inheritance of 
acquired characteristics, and he did it back in 1859.

<p>
As for your example of random mutation, yes there is no way it could have  
produced the enormous complexity and variety we see in life, but of course 
nobody said it did. Random mutation is only half of Darwin's Evolution, the 
other half is natural selection and that's not random. Please understand, 
I'm not talking of some subtle point of evolutionary theory, of which there 
are many, I'm talking Evolution 101, first lecture, first paragraph, probably 
first sentence.  This is why I don't think I'm being rude when I write about 
creationists, I think I give them all the respect they deserve.

Their favorite example is the eye of higher animals which is indeed a very 
complex and wonderful structure. Everything must be just right with the eye  
or it won't work they say, 5% of an eye is useless so it couldn't have 
evolved in small steps they say. They say a lot.

<p>
Many simple animals have spots on their bodies that contain pigments that are 
sensitive to light, they have zero resolution but they can tell day from 
night and that's an advantage over a creature that can't. If the spot is in a 
shallow depression in the animal's body it will have more sensitivity in one
direction that another, it will have a little bit of resolution, and that's 
another advantage over a creature without that ability. The deeper the 
depression the better the resolution, eventually you have a pin hole camera 
with excellent resolution but with terrible sensitivity, you need a lens. 
A drop of water can act like a lens and many animals have small glands that
excrete moisture on the outside of their skin. If there were certain proteins 
in the water it could turn it into a colorless jelly and give it some 
strength, now the eye can become larger.

<p>
Of course nature sometimes fucks up. The eye of all vertebrate animals is 
backwards. The connective tissue of the retina is on the wrong side so light 
must pass through it before it hits the light sensitive cells. There's no 
doubt this degrades vision and we'd be better off if the retina was reversed 
as it is in squids whose eye evolved independently. It's too late for that to
happen now because the intermediate forms would not be viable.
