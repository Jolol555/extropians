<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;that we might have a stable outcome similar to what we actually see:</i><br>
<i>&gt;people collecting into subgroups with shared opinions, where they believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;other members of their group are rational (at least on this issue!).</i><br>
<i>&gt;However the existence of significant groups with other opinions does</i><br>

<p>
First a clarification: I did not originate the argument that persistent
disagreement is irrational.  I only extended the argument from Bayesians
to arbitrarily computationally constrained agents.  

<p>
Your theory has a certain plausibility, but I'm bothered by thinking about
how these people evaluate whether they are rational or not.  Imagine a 
rational but dumb mind core which makes use of lots of smart but perhaps 
irrational mental modules.  If the core is evaluating the rationality
of its modules on the basis of private information about how well those
modules have met various rationality tests, we're back to the same 
situation again.<a name="1531qlink1">  It's irrational for the mind cores to agree to disagree
about the rationality of either of their modules.  

<p>
This suggests that the sort of irrationality needed here must be very
deep; there can't be a rational but dumb part of you that considers 
whether parts of you are irrational.</a>
