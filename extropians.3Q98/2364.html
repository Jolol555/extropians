<a href="2362.html#2364qlink1">&gt; Ethics and morality are different, Max. Whereas we can claim that the</a><br>
<i>&gt; laws</i><br>
<i>&gt; of physics etc. are the same everywhere, even if interpreted</i><br>
<i>&gt; differently by</i><br>
<i>&gt; differently cultures, that does not hold true for ethics and morality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Saying something is 'morally wrong' is only to apply a subjective</i><br>
<i>&gt; assessment which is culturally developed and may be culturally</i><br>
<i>&gt; normative.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Morals and ethics cannot be disproved, merely disagreed with.</i><br>

<a name="2408qlink1">	The only problem with that paragraph is that it mixes  'you
can't judge any morality to be wrong - it's subjective' together with a
moral judgement - 'don't judge other's morality'.
</a>

<p>
	It's a paradox I've never really figured out.</a>

<pre>
	Going back to 'concrete ethics vs plastic ethics'...
	I reckon that most ethical decisions have to be open for
</pre>
question because new experiences often call for new judgements - we
simply don't figure out every last detail before we get to it. If there
are areas we haven't considered ethically then there are ethics to be
formed 'on the fly' and so revision is pretty much guaranteed.
<p>
	However - it's going to be a matter of discussion and individual
decision rather than a 'group' morality emerging (unless someone starts
using some very clever subliminals on the rest of us).

<p>
	keep smilin'
