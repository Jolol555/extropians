<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, take egoism for example.  It's the easiest to adapt to this model:</i><br>
<i>&gt;egoism can be defined like this:  "You ought to do whatever is most in</i><br>
<i>&gt;your subjective interests."  Clearly this circumvents the problem you</i><br>
<i>&gt;assert above: I completely agree that a person's goals are entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt;subjective, but I can come up with a theory of practical rationality which</i><br>
<i>&gt;is compatible with it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As I noted in earlier posts, however, egoism is wrong, and we'd certainly</i><br>

<i>&gt;theories about how you should go about getting what you want, not about</i><br>
<i>&gt;deciding what you want.</i><br>

<a name="0404qlink1">Essentially then, your rational ethics doesn't tell us what we ought to do,
but rather how we should go about doing whatever it is that we think we
<a name="0404qlink2">ought to do.</a>  Which leaves open a niche for a new ethic, one which tells us
what we ought to do....  Perhaps you can see what I meant by calling this a
problem shift--it's a bit like the ancients inventing a new and prior god
to explain where god came from.

<a name="0404qlink3">What is needed is a rational metric to judge our goals.</a>  It's a pity that
<a name="0404qlink4">some of the ancient gods aren't around anymore to serve in this capacity;
they seemingly offered the prospect of an objective judgement.</a>

<p>
<a name="0428qlink1"><a name="0413qlink2"><a name="0404qlink5">Actually, there is one objective metric available, one which we</a> are
currently being judged against, and which our ancestors have all been held
accountable to: reproductive success.  This is the only bedrock that I know
of upon which to build a rational ethics.  It doesn't meet your
generalization principle, which is to say that the generalization principle
doesn't deal well with reality....</a>
