<a href="0692.html#0715qlink1">&gt;It didn't have to jump because if consciousness has a spatial location, which  is doubtful, it's certainly not where</a><br>
<i>&gt;the brain is but where the  senses are.  The brain by itself has no way of detecting position, or time for that</i><br>
<i>&gt;matter.</i><br>

<p>
Interesting you should say this.  A number of years ago NASA was playing around with remote-controlled
'robots' that had an anthropomorphic upper body, including 2 cameras for eyes, and 2 mikes for ears.  A person
could wear a device on the other side of the room and control its head movement, arms etc via a 'virtual-reality'
like connection.

<p>
The person wearing the controller stated it was the weirdest sensation he'd ever felt - he saw himself sitting
across the other side of the room, and said it was almost like an out-of-body experience. He felt like he was
outside his own body.

<p>
So, we could perhaps assert that the conscious experience was taking place outside his own body.  However,
the processing necessary to produce this experience was still firmly rooted in his own body.
