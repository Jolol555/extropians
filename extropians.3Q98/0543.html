Exactly. It depends on its use, like any tool.

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0553qlink2">Yes. If you are an extropian researcher who develops nanoprobes that can
reconstruct cryogenically frozen humans, then you are saving</a> litterally billions
<a name="0553qlink3">of lives. If a government agent comes to you, points a gun in your</a> face and tries
<a name="0553qlink4">to kill you, is your killing that agent right or wrong? There is a difference
between killing and murder.</a>

<a name="0553qlink5"><a href="0503.html#0543qlink3">&gt; &gt;When somebody comes into my office and lab to see the neat stuff that I</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;want to demonstrate for the future.  I want to show them my computers</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;future.  I don't want to unlock my gun cabinet and explain that those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;who are better armed will rule the future.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As more power is concentrated in your computers, expect them-and-yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be treated exactly the way others-and-their-guns are treated. How are</i><br>
<i>&gt; you going to prove you have a trigger lock on that GP assembler, hombre?</i><br>
<i>&gt; How are you going to convince me you can be trusted with that Orion engine</i><br>
<i>&gt; you plan to build?</i><br>

<p>
How do I know that you can be trusted with the power supply</a> that keeps hundreds of
AI's alive???

<a href="0503.html#0543qlink4">&gt; &gt;If I use a weapon to make someone act polite toward me, no respect has</a><br>

"It is better to be loved than feared, but if you cannot be loved, then make sure
you are feared."

<a name="0553qlink6"><a href="0503.html#0543qlink5">&gt; Fools are fools, no matter what they have in their hands. The problem here</a><br>
<i>&gt; is impulse control, not guns. Self government makes the whole gun matter a</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-issue. Absent more prevalent self government, the human race has a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; dim future.</i><br>

<p>
Hardly. Self government mandates self defense to whatever level</a> the individual
<a name="0553qlink7">feels negates the accepted risk level.</a>
