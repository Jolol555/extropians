That wasn't my intention.  I had in the back of my mind the observation (by
Anders?) that the most promising way to solve an anthropogenic global
warming crisis would be to treat it as a technical issue rather than a
moral one.  (Reserving the possibility, in my view, that the technical
issues might be modulated critically by moral choices made in the light of
non-technical values.)  

<p>
I hoped that the smart people here might have some interesting things to
suggest about the various projectable paths from the current productive and
distributive technologies (including economic policy theories) to a sheaf
of likely outcomes as we move into an increasingly automated and then
AI/assembler-driven economy.  Robin's list of sub-topics might well be the
way to start analysing the issues involved.  Taking such a technical tack
might help keep the discussion clear of intractable ideological disputes.

<p>
But the technical issues still require - in my view - an unflagging
awareness that the components of the algorithms we're playing with are
human beings, many of them unconscionably constrained and hurting already
and likely to become more so as time passes.  I want to find ways to help
people live spiritually rich (you know what I mean), non-violent,
non-self-destructive lives, if it's possible, in a world where many of them
are going to be structurally excluded from the activities that
traditionallly have given life meaning.
