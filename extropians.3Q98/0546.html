I started the posting you reference by saying that "Guns are tools, and tools
are useful."  In reference to the above example, I said that the use of guns
would be "Hopefully because that person's future plans are deemed to be 'bad'."
I concluded my posting by saying that guns are "useful in negative situations
that are not progressing in an extropian manner".

<p>
I'm sorry that this wasn't clear enough.  When I say something is not
extropian, I don't mean it is "bad", "unjustified" or "not useful".  

<p>
I would say that the writing end of a pencil is extropian, because it creates
and communicates.  The erasing end of a pencil is anti-extropian, because it
destroys and prevents communciaton.  Erasers are not bad, however.  Every
pencil I own has an eraser, because I need them.  My feelings about guns are
the same.  They limit others rather than enable ourselves.  They destroy rather
than create.  They stop actions rather than starting actions.  Sometimes such
destruction is necessary, but let's not get pro-destruction and say that such
actions are part of extropian ideals.  Such actions are to avoid the loss of
extropian potential.  But let's not confuse avoiding loss with an actual gain.
