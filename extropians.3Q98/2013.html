Joe Jenkins asks:
<br>
<a href="2012.html#2013qlink1">&gt; Where do others stand on this list?  So far, it seems I'm the only one</a><br>
<i>&gt; on the list with this idea of identity.  If I'm the only one on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; list, I'm probably the only one in the world.  What a lonely and cold</i><br>
<i>&gt; feeling it is to be the sole resident of this memetic fitness bump. </i><br>
<i>&gt; What are you guys selecting for anyway?  Anyone want to party at my</i><br>
<i>&gt; place?</i><br>

<a name="2021qlink1">Personally I think Joe's treatment is pretty reasonable.  In a world
in which making temporary copies was easy, I suspect that I could get
comfortable with pushing the self-terminate button if I knew that a very
recent copy was continuing on.  Similarly I could face my own death with
considerably more ease if I knew that I had a recent backup.</a>

<p>
As Joe has written, there are a few reasons for this:


<UL>
  <li>  It allows me to take advantage of copying technology in a manner which
   would not be practical if all copies were permanent.  The latter would
   raise difficult problems of resource distribution, etc.

  <li>  Over a long period of time, I will do this many times, and I basically
   would expect to get used to it.  The loss of information each time
   would not seem too bad based on my many experiences with the process.

  <li>  Every night when I fall asleep I face the same problem: my current
   thoughts will be lost due to hypnagogic amnesia.  As I relinquish my
   consciousness, the "me" which is drowsily thinking will be destroyed
   forever.  When I awaken in the morning my last memories will be
   of thoughts which preceded those which I had just before sleep.
   But I've gotten used to it.

  <li>  A technological trick could help: all copies are treated identically,
   and at the end of the temporary split we all push the self-terminate
   button, with only one copy, randomly selected, allowed to continue.
   This way I am able to practice pushing the button and becoming inured
   to it over time.

  <li>  If many-worlds is true then when I push the self-terminate button it
   won't seem to work, my consciousness will continue on in some universe.
   Much the same thing is true if a merciful God exists.  This may give
   me solace even when I know that this instance of me is about to be
   destroyed.
