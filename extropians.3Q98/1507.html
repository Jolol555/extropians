<i>&gt;Michael M. Butler:</i><br>
<a href="1472.html#1507qlink1">&gt;Lots of people have blown rockets up. </a><br>
Aye, and the more parts they have, the more likely.

<p>
<a href="1472.html#1507qlink2">&gt;Minor points: weren't the fielded systems simple solid boosters? And I seem</a><br>
<i>&gt;to recall that the hypergolics were (/are) generally pretty wicked both to</i><br>
<i>&gt;handle and to deal with if you got any on you (RFNA, UDMH, N04...).</i><br>
The early units were Nitric acid and Aniline motors.  This was safer than using LOX because you are guaranteed ignition.  Ignition failure=BOOM.

<p>
<a href="1472.html#1507qlink3">&gt;Yep, too big, too dumb. My outsider's view is that it's not sexy or leading</a><br>
<i>&gt;edge and you have to "think Russian" (these are of course cognate).</i><br>

<p>
Yes, and there is a mental concept of scale that people carry in their heads, and it is a shock to them to have that preconception re-adjusted.  A related Truax/Goddard story: Bob said that when Goddard saw the business end of the V2's after the war, his jaw, literally, dropped in amazement.  How could anyone build a rocket SO BIG???  I think we all suffer from the same error.  What we should say, looking at a Space Shuttle, is: how can anyone build a rocket SO COMPLEX?

<p>
Here is an exercise: compare a large ship to a Saturn V rocket, and the rocket is clearly short, light, small.  And rockets don't suffer from the same scaling law that limits airplanes to somewhere around the size of a 747 (square/cubed law relation of lifting area to weight).

<p>
<a href="1472.html#1507qlink4">&gt;the PR (/perceived environmental) impact of a *BIG* boom can be daunting,</a><br>
Yes.  Perception again.  Sea launch=little boom.  LOX/Kerosene=low toxic emission relative to solid boosters or the hypergolics used in the Titan series rockets.

<p>
<a href="1472.html#1507qlink5">&gt;Also, &lt;sarcasm on&gt; whaddawe want a big booster for? Nobody *DOES*</a><br>
<i>&gt;anything in space that size. &lt;sarcasm off&gt; </i><br>
This is not a joke to investors.  They don't care much about the future.

<p>
<a href="1472.html#1507qlink6">&gt;So of course they never will.</a><br>
Never say that, have you forgotten our principles?!  Gasp!


<p>
(snipped: re projects running out of money)
<br>
<a href="1472.html#1507qlink7">&gt;Having lived and too often breathed Silicon Valley, permit me to remark</a><br>
<i>&gt;that this is a salient feature of much of life here. </i><br>
<a name="1587qlink1">Sure, its human nature.  But I get annoyed listening to arguments for/against various impractical booster concepts when it is obvious they are impractical.</a>  Piggybacked winged stages.  Single stage to orbit techno-marvels that carry virtually no payload despite pushing all structures beyond the state of the art.  Dozens of space shuttle main engines ganged together, all operating reliably, simultaneously(!).  Mid-flight propellant loading from another vehicle.  SCRAMLACE (liquify oxygen from the air in flight, for use out of the atmosphere).  Sheesh.


<p>
Us space enthusiasts are our own worst enemy, all pointing to the stars, but all in different directions.
