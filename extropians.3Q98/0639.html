That's what the digsig is for. :)

<i>&gt;        &gt;I am trying to argue that there must be continuity of</i><br>
<pre>
consciousness         
<br>
<a href="0577.html#0639qlink3">&gt;        &gt;to be sure that the uploaded one is the actual original </a><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;consciousness, instead of a consciousness that was just</i><br>
created,         
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink4">&gt;        &gt;while destroying the first.</a><br>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps true, perhaps not, it's irrelevant. Consciousness is obviously </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;subjective so even if I stopped all your brain activity for a billion</i><br>
years 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink5">&gt;and then restarted it there is no way you could tell internally, you</a><br>
could 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink6">&gt;detect no gaps without observing the  outside world, so your</a><br>
consciousness 
<br>
<i>&gt;would be continuous.</i><br>

<p>
If it is the same consciousness, I would agree.
However, this begs the question at hand, which
is:  *Is* this the same consciousness, or a very
similar consciousness which happens to have
the original consciousness' memories?

<p>
<a href="0577.html#0639qlink7">&gt;        &gt;you might need to simulate the entire structure to get</a><br>
consciousness 
<br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink8">&gt;Then simulate the mind, although "simulate" is not really the correct</a><br>
word 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink9">&gt;when dealing with information, a calculator doesn't perform simulated</a><br>
arithmetic. 

<p>
Perhaps you will agree that consciousness is somewhat
more complicated than arithmetic? :)  When dealing with
other simulations, it seems clear that the most 
straightforward way to run a Macintosh program on a
PC is not to rewrite the program from scratch, but to 
simulate the Macintosh to the program.  It may be that
this will be the *only* practical way to transfer 
consciousness to a non-brain computer.  

<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;I don't agree that the entire brain is required [to understand </i><br>
<pre>
     
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink10">&gt;        &gt;subjective experience].  Only specific memories are required,</a><br>
those         
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink11">&gt;        &gt;of you thinking about being conscious.</a><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Interesting theory, but as we're talking about consciousness not</i><br>
intelligence 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink12">&gt;or behavior, how will you ever know if you're theory is correct?</a><br>

<p>
By subjectively experiencing the memories.
This seems very clear to me.  If I experience
a memory from your brain, of you thinking about
<a name="0692qlink1">being conscious, then I know that you are
(or were, at least, for that period)</a> conscious,
<a name="0736qlink7"><a name="0692qlink2">as that is the only way such a memory could</a> be
</a>
produced.

<p>
<a href="0577.html#0639qlink13">&gt;        &gt;if I could experience a memory of yours, then *that*  would    </a><br>
   
<p>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink14">&gt;        &gt;be me experiencing being you, for the length of the memory, no?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Books, music or a painting, give me a different subjective experience</i><br>
than 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink15">&gt;these exact same things give you (I think), sometimes very different (I</a><br>
think) 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink16">&gt;so why would you expect my memories to effect you the same way they do </a><br>
<i>&gt;me?</i><br>

<p>
They don't have to produce the same effect, I only
<a name="0736qlink10"><a name="0692qlink3">have to *know* that you thought about being 
</a>
conscious, which is the same as being conscious.</a>

<p>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink17">&gt;There is an even deeper problem, the only reason I think the 6 year old </a><br>

<p>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink18">&gt;John Clark is not dead, at least not entirely dead, is that I remember</a><br>
being 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink19">&gt;him, if technology advances to the point (and it will) where you can</a><br>
really 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink20">&gt;remember being me then you are  me, and Randall R Randall still has no</a><br>
idea 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink21">&gt;what it's like to be John Clark.</a><br>

<p>
I don't know whether the 6 year old John Clark (or Randall Randall)
is dead.  Perhaps further knowledge about consciousness will
allow us to determine things like this.

<p>
<a href="0577.html#0639qlink22">&gt;        &gt;If someone with plastic surgery and a really good imitation of</a><br>
<pre>
you         
<br>
<a href="0577.html#0639qlink23">&gt;        &gt;came along and asked you politely to commit suicide, so he</a><br>
could         
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink24">&gt;        &gt;step into your life, would you? </a><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt;HELL NO, my momma didn't raise no dummies! The situation is not</i><br>
symmetrical 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink25">&gt;because the two act differently, one asks the other to sacrifice himself</a><br>
but  
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink26">&gt;the other asks no such thing, so the two "copies" can not be anywhere</a><br>
close  
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink27">&gt;to being identical. Let me propose a thought experiment of my own.</a><br>

<p>
That's a good point.

<p>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink28">&gt;An exact duplicate of the earth, and it's entire ecosystem, is created </a><br>
<i>&gt;a billion light years away. The duplicate world would need some sort of </i><br>
<i>&gt;feedback mechanism to keep the worlds in synchronization, non linear</i><br>
effects 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink29">&gt;would amplify tiny variations, even quantum fluctuations, into big </a><br>
<i>&gt;differences, but this is a thought experiment so who cares. In the first</i><br>
two
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink30">&gt;cases below the results would vary according to personalities, remember </a><br>
<i>&gt;there's a lot of illogic even in the best of us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;             </i><br>
<i>&gt;1) I know all about the duplicate world and you put a 44 magnum to my</i><br>
head 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink31">&gt;   and tell me in ten seconds you will blow my brains out, am I</a><br>
concerned? 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink32">&gt;   You bet I am because I know that your double is holding an identical</a><br>
gun 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink33">&gt;   to the head of my double and making an identical threat.</a><br>
<i>&gt;             </i><br>
<i>&gt;2) I find out that for the first time since the Big Bang the worlds will</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink34">&gt;   diverge, in 10 seconds you will put a bullet in my head but my double</a><br>
will 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink35">&gt;   be spared, am I concerned? Yes, and angry as well, in times of</a><br>
intense 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink36">&gt;   stress nobody is very logical. My double is no longer exact because I</a><br>
am 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink37">&gt;   going through a traumatic experience and my double is not. I'd be</a><br>
looking 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink38">&gt;   at that huge gun and wondering what it will be like when it goes off</a><br>
and 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink39">&gt;   if death will really be instantaneous. I'd be wondering if my</a><br>
philosophy 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink40">&gt;   was really as sound as I thought it was and I'd also be wondering why</a><br>
I 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink41">&gt;   get the bullet and not my double and cursing the unfairness of it</a><br>
all. 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink42">&gt;   My (semi) double would be thinking "it's a shame about that other</a><br>
fellow 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink43">&gt;   but I'm glad it's not me".</a><br>

<p>
I agree with these two reactions, at least.

<p>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink44">&gt;3) I know nothing about the duplicate world, a gun is at both our heads</a><br>
and 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink45">&gt;   we both are convinced we're going to die. One gun goes off, making a</a><br>
hell 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink46">&gt;   of a mess, but the other gun, for inexplicable reasons misfires. In</a><br>
this 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink47">&gt;   case NOBODY died and except for undergoing a terrifying experience I</a><br>
am 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink48">&gt;   completely unharmed. The real beauty part is that I don't even have</a><br>
to  
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink49">&gt;   clean up the mess.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="0692qlink4">But if no one died, who is that dead guy?</a>  Did 
<a name="0736qlink14"><a name="0692qlink5">the consciousness inside him magically jump
</a>
to the other John Clark and combine</a> with it?  I
would say that the fellow who used to own that
dead body has died, even though this doesn't
affect the fellow who is exactly like him, except
for location.

<p>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink50">&gt;The bottom line is we don't have thoughts and emotions, we are thoughts</a><br>
and 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink51">&gt;emotions, and the idea that the particular hardware that is rendering</a><br>
them 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink52">&gt;changes their meaning is as crazy as my computer making the meaning of</a><br>
your 
<br>
<a href="0617.html#0639qlink53">&gt;post different from what it was on yours.</a><br>

<p>
Nor am I arguing that the hardware changes the
meaning, if done properly.  I am only arguing that
it is very important to have continuity in consciousness,
even while uploading.
