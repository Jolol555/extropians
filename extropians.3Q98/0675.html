My... to have confidence of THAT calibre.  I guess all these psych and
genetics courses I'm currently enrolled in have spoiled me.  

<p>
All jokes about blue denim aside, most of the literature I read for my term
paper [which focused on sexual orientation] in Behavioral Genetics class
last semester leans toward a cluster of markers on the X chromosome [the
Xq28 region, if you care] which appear to be linked to at least one subtype
of male sexual orientation.

Good choice of papers, Anders.  It's one of my favorites.  

<p>
Beyond that, they've even managed to divvy up the "sexual orientation"
concept into 3 or 4 major subcategories.  The commonly held definition is
simply the sex (or sexes) I'm attracted to.  Cool.

<p>
Now, in addition, we also care about the sex(es) which is attracted to ME.
Some even mix in _my concept_ of which sex(es) I attract and am attracted to.  

<p>
Yet Jim up above seems to have it all figured out.

<p>
Well, for us bisexuals, this isn't really an issue.  But one study I read
(which I can't seem to find in my collection of papers from Spring... I
might have to go re-look it up) had the scientists manipulating one (and
only one) facet of sexual orientation I discussed above.  That is, trying to
change the sex which likes the fruitfly while keeping the fruitfly attracted
to the original sex.  I'll get to the details when I can find the friggin'
paper.  (and it was fruitflies in the study, I wasn't disparaging anyone.)

<p>
And to whoever that guy was who wrote this...

<a href="0655.html#0675qlink4">&gt;  The "normal" mating pattern for humans has the young males competing with</a><br>
<i>&gt;  each other to "get laid", i.e. to convince young women to let them</i><br>

We don't all live in a frat house.  That's the limitation of your "normal"
pattern.
