Yes, but it was Special Circumstances... :-)

It seem that the Culture strategy is to use minimal force to change
things, leaving the actual change largely up to the other
civilization. In PoG they crashed the system, but let the Azadians
start building a new (with some subtle help to avoid getting trapped
in the old attractor). The various wars in Use of Weapons were
similar: just add Zaklave to any already existing military conflict to
make the outcome certain. The major exceptions seem to have been
Excession (where minimal force might not have been applicable to reach
the Affront) or Consider Phlebas, but both novels deal with 'non
equilibrium politics'.

<p>
I haven't read the books, but one thing that amuses me is the idea
that very powerful beings will have too much time on their hands. I
expect the opposite. :-)

&lt;Looks at a cosmological watch; chi is almost 2pi&gt; "Oh dear! Oh dear!
I shall be late!" &lt;pops down a large worm-hole&gt;
