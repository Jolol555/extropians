<a name="2499qlink1">Dear Mr. Nicoletti and Mr. Long,</a>

<p>
<a name="2516qlink1"><a name="2499qlink2">Attached is an example of spam which I have been receiving from your
network.  When I inquired in the anti-spam community the general
response was that direct1.net was a spam-happy spamhaus which allows
its customers to steal computer services from innocent netizens.</a>  Not
</a>
being one to take this at face value, I decided to check out your
website and see if there is any indication of your pro- or anti- theft
of electronic services position.  I checked your faq and other links
but could find no info other than you allow people to use their
accounts for commercial use (from the FAQ.)  Next I checked to see if
you had an abuse, spam-complaint, or fraud mail account, none of which
were to be found.

<p>
So I am writing you to ask you direct:  does direct1.net knowingly
allow and support their customers who steal electronic services via
UCE (aka spam) and act as a spamhaus or spamdrop?  

<p>
Please consider that (1) the courts have repeatedly upheld that the
right of free speech stops at the border of our property (our routers,
our networks, our servers) and (2) it is not legal for advertisers to
transfer the majority of the costs of advertisements to the carriers
and recipients of the advertisements (see TCPA and the junk fax law -
this is the basis of the same).

<p>
I look forward to hearing from you and thank you in advance for your
time and consideration of this inquiry.

<p>
The spam which originated and spamvertises a server on your network
follows.  Please note that this was sent to a mailing list dedicated
to enhancement of quality of life and life extension and has NO prior
relationship with this THIEF.
