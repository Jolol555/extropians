<a href="2267.html#2270qlink1">&gt;4. ON THE FUTURE OF CARBON NANOTUBE CHEMISTRY</a><br>
<i>&gt;... 4) Perhaps of greatest interest</a> is</i><br>
<i>&gt;the recent demonstration by Heer et al (Georgia Institute of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Technology, US), confirming theoretical predictions, that carbon</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotubes can carry current at room temperature with essentially</i><br>
<i>&gt;no resistance.  ... At the present time, single-</i><br>
<i>&gt;walled carbon nanotubes are commercially available for</i><br>
<i>&gt;approximately US$200 per gram. ...</i><br>

<p>
That CEO of Magnetic Power Inc. and ROOTS I mentioned called me
on the phone, and convinced me they have a reasonable case for
having found room temperature superconductivity.  It's in a 
silicon polymer, but so far only in rare filimants of ~10nm length.
They have improved their yield by 10^4 over the last few years, but
still have a ways to go, though they have some nearterm 
applications feasible with low yields.  (They invited folks up to 
see their lab, ~ 50 miles north of bay area.)

<p>
So the bottom line seems to be that we have several known room T
superconductors, and it'll be a race to see which tech can improve
their production process the fastest.  Given all other applications
for nanotubes, I guess I'd bet on them.  But it could be many years
still.
