<p>
I don't. Bioweapons haven't proven very successful in reality, and I don't
see why they should be a global disaster; sure, they spread, but in most
cases they either spread so slowly that cures can be found or so fast that
they wipe out the carriers before they get very far. I'm sure we can breed
some bioweapons to wipe out the vast majority of humans if we try hard
enough, but it will take a lot of work and a lot of money.

And, outside governments, crazies with mass destruction weapons are quite

weapons which can kill millions or billions of people.</a>

<p>
Nonsense. There is a very easy way to protect yourself; don't be there
when it happens. There are many obvious nuclear targets on this planet,
and avoiding those reduces the level of danger by many orders of
magnitude.

So what? If it exists then you get off Earth.</a> I don't see why we should
keep trying to play King Canute rather than accept reality and deal with
it. If that technology exists it will be used regardless of all the 
precautions you may take to prevent it; if you're there you're dead. So 
make sure you're not there.
