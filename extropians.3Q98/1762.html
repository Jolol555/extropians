yup you're right james .  i juggled the letters trying to find
a middle name that would make jenny peter chambers
an anagram, but couldnt do it.  sigh.  when a gag is
being played i always hope for a sophisticated one.
good satire is that which so resembles reality that
one is unsure if the piece is actually satire.  "jenny" was too
obvious to be much fun. {8-[  i try to maintain a sense of humor
even if the jokester is up to no good...  {8^D

<a name="1773qlink1">i worry somewhat that my post regarding transplantation of
one's head onto the body of a chimp might be taken as
a malicious chambers-like hoax, but it was not intended
as a gag.  perhaps baboons would be cheaper?  can you
take baboons from the wild?  i dont think you can do
that with chimps.  the experiment only has to keep your
brain alive for a short time until one can get frozen.  spike
