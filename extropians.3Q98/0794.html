<i>&gt;From <a href="http://www.pcfix2000.com/">http://www.pcfix2000.com/</a></i><br>

<p>
PCFIX2000 is the result of over 4 years of research. We've worked with
hundreds upon hundreds of PCs and have discovered all manner of problems
that can come from the BIOS Software or the CMOS Clock. We built a
matrix of BIOS Software and Clock chip faults, resolved the required
'fix' for each fault, and finally coded it into a 
utility program that executes whenever your system is powered up or
reset! 

<p>
PCFIX2000 tests and corrects the date according to our selective
algorithm whenever it is required, then it goes away. PCFIX2000 passes a
valid date to the Operating System and CMOS Clock. 

<p>
Unlike most other utilities, PCFIX2000 provides automatic adjustment to
both the operating system and hardware clock and flawlessly handles Year
2000 transition and date adjustments; even AFTER 1-01-2000! 

<p>
PCFIX2000 also handles ALL LEAP YEAR Clock adjustments including
automatic date recovery for MISSING LEAP DAYS. There are no critical
BIOS dates or CMOS Clock limitations with PCFIX2000 because it adjusts
for every BIOS and Clock from every properly functioning IBM compatible
PC. 

<p>
PCFIX2000 Installation is a snap because the installation program is
very user-friendly. No complicated instructions, no configuration
hassles and no headaches. PCFIX2000 truely is the UNIVERSAL PC YEAR 2000
HARDWARE FIX! Nothing else even comes close. 

<p>
PCFIX2000 will enable all properly functioning IBM PC compatable systems
to pass all date/time tests for 2000 compliance. 

<p>
We are so convinced about the universal capability of PCFIX2000 we
guarantee that once installed on a non-compliant PC, it will remain
hardware 2000 compliant for the life of your PC or we will give a full
refund.
