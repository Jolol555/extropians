<p>
The above example of "logic" is based on CIRCULAR LOGIC.  Your
conclusion can only be read out of these sentences if you already
believe your conclusion.  For those of us who do not believe your
conclusion, your above sentences are irrational and illogical.

<p>
For someone who does not hold your conclusion as accurate, your
statement above reads thusly:  "A program called #1 is running on a
</a>
system while a redundant program called #2 is running on a redundant
system, and when you eliminate program #1 by removing its hardware
platform, you will see that program #2 is still running, and by renaming
program #2 to now be called program #1, you will see that program #1
remains unaffected by its hardware shutdown."
