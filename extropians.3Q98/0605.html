We Europeans.

<a name="0622qlink2"><a href="0603.html#0605qlink2">&gt; And who thinks we have this image problem?</a><br>

<p>
Freedom-loving Americans on this list (yeah, yeah, sounds like some
bs propaganda, but they *do* love freedom, which includes the right
to keep and bear arms, and they *are* Americans -- hence freedomloving
 Americans).</a>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; a threat than a wimpy little gun ever will be?</i><br>

<i>&gt; Well taking this argument to the extreme we ought to give everybody their</i><br>

<a name="0622qlink4">The point is that it is rather strange that people who deeply dislike
<a name="0656qlink1">guns because they're "dangerous killing machines", think so positively
of the future, which will deliver powerful tools of (mass) destruction 
into the hands of more people than ever before.
