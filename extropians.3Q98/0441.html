<i>&gt; Yes and no... if you're poor but live in a good area, then spending money</i><br>

<i>&gt; a massive drop in murders (e.g. based on national figures Floridian murder</i><br>
<i>&gt; rates probably dropped about 20% after the concealed carry law was passed,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is significant but nothing like the 99% drop in moving from DC to</i><br>
<i>&gt; Vermont) the risk to an individual carrying a gun may well drop more. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone decides to rob and kill me and I point a gun at them and they run</i><br>
<i>&gt; away, they may well just rob and kill some unarmed person instead; so the</i><br>
<i>&gt; murder rate won't drop, but *my* chances of being murdered in that instance</i><br>
<i>&gt; went down 100%.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, very much so.

<p>
<a href="0432.html#0441qlink2">&gt; &gt;If I were living in a neighborhood</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;where crime was rampant, and for whatever reason couldn't/wouldn't leave,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;then owning a gun might very well be reasonable. If I didn't (and I don't),</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;then my resources are likely better spent elsewhere.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0446qlink1">Depends. It seems like the 'bad neighborhood' syndrome tends to spread like a
cancer, and only some serious work can turn such trends around.</a> You might live
<a name="0446qlink2">in a nice neighborhood today, but what happens when some pretty bad</a> people move
<a name="0446qlink3">into your neighborhood either because they got scared of the really</a> bad people
<a name="0446qlink4">in their old neighborhood, or are looking for virgin territory to fleece? Are
you gonna move someplace else? And someplace else again? and again?</a> and again?
<a name="0446qlink5">When do you stop running and start shooting back?</a>

<p>
<a href="0432.html#0441qlink3">&gt; Quite possibly; we're not saying that owning a gun will magically make</a><br>
<i>&gt; you invulnerable, nor that everyone needs to. We're saying that even if</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun ownership didn't reduce murder rates to some extent, attempts to ban</i><br>
<i>&gt; them are far, far less useful than other actions.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0446qlink6">Yes, why is Mutual Assured Destruction a fine policy for nation states</a> but not
<a name="0446qlink7">for individual people? Its worked fine for 50 years around the world, I think
that a personal policy of micro-MAD is a fine survival policy.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0432.html#0441qlink4">&gt; Certainly if I owned a gun it would be primarily for shooting at targets,</a><br>
<i>&gt; not for shooting at people. But knowing that I could shoot people if I</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever got into a situation where I had to would certainly be a benefit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I find</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;this a sobering thought: it would be a sad irony indeed if in gaining</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;indefinite lifespans we become afraid to live.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not neccesarily; we might decide to stop crossing streets, but we would</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably work out ways to reduce the risks associated with crossing</i><br>
<i>&gt; streets... e.g. armored bodies, remote drones linked to brains in vats,</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc. We'd want to reduce the risks, but there are numerous ways to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; that.</i><br>

<p>
I think that the deterrent effect of  micro-MAD on a person for person basis is
fine. I'm not afraid to live, I'm gonna take whatever measures are needed to
live as long and as much as I can. I won't be scared of going certain places
either.
