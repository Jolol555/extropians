<p>
If the knowledge is by definition completely beyond us then it would
be completely beyond our heuristics to analyze as valid. It would be
impossible to prove valid but it might seem invalid when applying
the scientific method (SM). It should be extremely difficult to distinguish
between Strong SI knowledge and bunk. Both will not be able to be
proved valid by the SM and both will probably be considered patently
invalid when analyzing it with the SM. I anticipate some may say we
might be able to sense some validity due to mathematical beauty, 
consistency or some other trait of Strong SI knowledge. But I doubt
this will be the case because Strong SI knowledge will be so completely
alien to us that such characteristics will not emerge from our analysis.

<p>
If we are able to sense some trace of validity then odds are such
knowledge is not Strong SI knowledge but instead knowledge forged by
a Weak SI. For example, a Weak SI in 1700 might have come up with 
M-Theory. M-Theory might look like complete nonsense to an 18th century
mathematician or physicist but odds are they might be able to discern
some validity hidden in all the mathematical arcana. It might look like
Strong SI knowledge but it isn't.
