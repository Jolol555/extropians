<p>
Not directly, but his aim is rather clear by his theological
speculations in PoI and the fact that he proposes an omega-point state
that is awfully close to the typical western concept of God even when
alternatives (such as a fractally divering pantheon of Powers or
something similar) are possible within the OPT framework.</a>

<p>
Tipler doesn't propose worship (other than the fundamentally important
mega-project of starting the omega-development process), but his
theorty seems to give at least some people the same comforts as
standard religion: there is a wonderful eternal life to look forward
to, the evils of the world are necessary but will be corrected, and so
on. Not quite a religion in the social sense (yet), but not far off.</a>
