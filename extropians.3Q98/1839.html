<p>
LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters)- A Texan millionaire is paying 
a cloning laboratory $5 million to produce a living replica 
of his pet dog Missy, according to a BBC programme.</a> 

<p>
The laboratory has already received some cells from the dog, 
which is part collie, part Alsatian, Newsnight said on Monday. 

<p>
The cloning laboratory of Texas A &amp; M University at College 
Station had been given two years to produce a clone. 

<p>
Laboratory Director Mark Westhusin said he thought other 
millionaires would be keen to follow suit. 

<p>
``I'm sure there are lots of them out there that would if 
they knew the potential existed to do it,'' Westhusin said. 

<p>
Newsnight said other laboratories and companies were hoping 
to move into commercial cloning of pets and racehorses.
