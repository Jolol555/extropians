<p>
Over the last couple of weeks I've had a discussion with a friend off-list
about smart drugs and other nutrient supplements and had other occasions to
wish for guidance on the best available information on anti-aging substances.
Perhaps because the supplement business IS a big and growing business, there
is an overwhelming amount of material available on the web, much of it in the
nature of advertising and promotion.  

<p>
<a name="1809qlink1"><a name="1776qlink1">Can list member suggest resources that add value to the great mass of
information that is available?  In particular, I and I think a lot of people
are looking for two things: Order and Quality.  Are there any sites out there
that do a decent job of organizing up-to-date information about supplements
and offer quality information about them?</a>
