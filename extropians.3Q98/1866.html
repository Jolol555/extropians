<p>
Does science hold all the answers? I think that depends on the set of
questions; some questions are answerable by science (what will happen
if I mix chemical X with chemical Y?), some can in principle be
answered using scientific methods but there is little point in doing
so (what kind of clothes will I wear tomorrow? - you could perhaps
model me and my environment using quantum mechanics to find out, but
it would be too bothersome), some do not deal with the domain of the
real world (what was the motivations of Don Quixote?) and some are
pure philosophy (is it ethical to uplift squids?). Saying science can
give us *all* the answers seems a bit unfounded. However, I would say
science can answer most practical questions, and give us important
data for constraining the answers in other categories of questions.

<p>
&gt; Several times I have found that I need a very simple explenation of what<br>
<a href="1843.html#1866qlink2">&gt; makes something scientifically sound and what doesn't.</a><br>

<p>
In addition to the good points made by others in this thread, I like
to point out that science is deep down an organized search for
knowledge. It is notable that pseudoscience tends to be very
unorganized and haphazard, with little of the cumulative accumulation,
verification and integration of knowledge science shows.

<i>&gt; be of interrest to more people on this list than me.</i><br>

<p>
Actually, I think this is extropian in the sense that it deals with
finding the best tools for our development.
