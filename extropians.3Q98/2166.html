From: J. Maxwell Legg
<br>
<a href="2160.html#2166qlink1">&gt;Since doing this little exercise (on_the_fly as it were) I noticed</a><br>
that the
<br>
<a href="2160.html#2166qlink2">&gt;investment definition was at an arms length to the subject whereas my</a><br>
ad hoc
<br>
<a href="2160.html#2166qlink3">&gt;decision definition was meddlesome. What would be the effect on</a><br>
society if there were no arms length transactions. Anybody?
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
If you define society as one person's relationship to another, and
extend that to include an entire population, then an absence of arm's
length transactions might create the kind of virtual community
described by Howard Rhiengold in his book by that title. But to
displace current societal structure with an entirely virtual one seems
absolutely inappropriate if not totally impossible. No sensible reason
for completely abandoning all arm's length transactions occurs to me.
<a name="2168qlink1">Consequently, the effect of eliminating arm's length transactions from
a portion of the social order would tend to have no other effect than
to increase emotional isolation of that society's members while
increasing transactions of the virtual kind.</a> The only way to find out
how abandoning arm's length transactions would effect society would
require an actual experiment along those lines. As you probably have
read, MUDs (as just one example of a kind of social interaction at
other than arm's length) appear to have an addictive quality for
participants.

Cheers,
