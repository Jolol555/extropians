  I'm concerned about who decides the sick from the healthy, for instance
<a name="0558qlink2">Trent Lot considers homosexuals "sick" but a many people do not share his
views, but Mr. Lot is in a position of some power and he can influence
the content of laws to enforce his view of illness or at least stop</a> bills
from even coming up for debate. Or how about the lying, backstabbing, and
general unethical behavior that occurs at many levels of corporations and
goverments. I consider some of that behavior to be "sick", but I can't 
directly influence laws or decide who goes onto the committe that writes
the report on who is considered "sick" or healthy.
