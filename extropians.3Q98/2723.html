Thom Quinn (evolu@evolutionary.org) did ask:

<p>
<a href="0438.html#2723qlink1">&gt;Last week, there was a discussion on the zeroth law of robotics. </a><br>
<i>&gt;I once heard of the zeroth law of thermodynamics, but have never </i><br>
<i>&gt;seen it listed anywhere. What is the zeroth law of thermodynamics? </i><br>

<p>
  IAN: The zeroth law of thermodynamics seems 
  circular to me.  It states that if you have 
  two bodies A and B, and the temperature of 
  A = B, and you have another body C, the 
  temperature of which equals that of
<br>
  A and B, then A = B = C. Gasp!

<p>
  My law of zero-temperature says that the 
  temperature of All (such as the whole uni
  verse, all space and time) is zero, since
  the hottest part of All is as much hotter 
  (+) than the coldest parts as the coldest
  parts are colder (-), and this equal and 
  opposite symmetry sums to zero difference.

<p>
<a name="2727qlink1">  This is also true for any subset of All.
  Of the time period covering 24 hours, the
  temperature in a room has points/periods
  that are hotter and that are colder, and 
  the net difference equals zero. Since any
  numerical temperature is measured by its 
  difference from temperature = zero, and 
  since 1 - 1 = 0 and 0 - 1 = -1, net difference
  /temperature always equals zero.</a>

<p>
  Everything is a state of difference, 
<br>
  and net difference always equals zero.
  This is the Great Void known as Brahman.
