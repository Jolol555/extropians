<i>&gt; would not have had time to complete his house and the wolf</i><br>
<i>&gt; would have plucked him kicking and screaming from his half-built</i><br>
<i>&gt; house.</i><br>

<p>
Actually, because the houses of pigs one and two were so flimsy,
that the wolf lost hardly any time dealing with them. More importantly,
the wise no. 3 pig had planned well in advance, and had his house
ready on schedule, well before the wolf's campaign.

<a href="0219.html#0233qlink2">&gt; To stretch analogy far past its breaking point, we really need</a><br>
<i>&gt; society as a whole to keep on about its business while the</i><br>
<i>&gt; futurists work out how to make the transition to the posthuman</i><br>
<i>&gt; condition. In return for the service of maintaining society,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the futurists should try to help the remainder of humanity to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make the transition, not scoff at them as a bunch of clueless losers.</i><br>

<p>
"The rest of society" isn't doing their "service" for *us*, just
like plants don't produce oxigen for our sake. Progress is a byproduct
of individuals' self-interest. Most people on this list already
contribute (more than) their fair share to society (either actively
through their work, or passively by consuming and paying taxes etc.), so
we don't "owe" sociey any more than anyone else. Most of us are already
spreading the meme whenever we can. It's out there. People can either
adopt or reject it, but that's *their* responsibility, not ours. And
yes, rejecting a meme that could considerably improve your condition
*is* stupid.

<p>
Besides, the influence of the futurist isn't *that* big. Society will
either destroy itself or succeed with or without their help, it's beyond
any person's or (small) group's control.

<p>
So, instead of worrying about society/humanity, we'd better worry about
our own condition first; that's where you can make the *real*
difference.
