About a year or so ago I went and looked up a bunch of statistics on 
crime (I used a bunch of sources, but the most useful was a UN report, 
available online, which I can't seem to find at the moment). 

<p>
I was glad at the time that I wasn't looking specifically at the domestic 
violence figures, but rather at the murder rate, and total rate of vilent 
crime.  The domestic violence figures are a complete mess.  Comparing 
statistics for domestic violence across countries is pointless, because 
of differences in how frequently the crime is reported, and how 
seriously it is treated when reported.  

<p>
On a general note, I was interested to discover that the rate of violent 
crime seems to be fairly comparable in the US and Australia (within a 
factor of 2, depending on crime; also, I had to extrapolate because the 
figures I could find were all at least a few years old), but much lower in 
Switzerland. On the other hand, America had a far higher murder rate (~4 
to 5 times) than Australia.  Australia, in turn, stood in a similar 
relation to Switzerland.

<a name="0284qlink1">I don't know why this is so.  Gun laws seemed the obvious answer to me, 
but a correspondent pointed out that only one quarter of murders in the 
US are done with a gun.  I didn't check the figure, but he's a reliable 
guy, and I assume he knows his stuff.  This fact does shoot a hole 
(couldn't resist, sorry :-) in my hypothesis.  I've been curious ever 
since why, even if you simply remove all the gun deaths by fiat, there 
are still so many murders in the US.</a>

<p>
This wasn't addressed to me, but right at the moment, it sounds like very 
good advice, which I'll try to take in the interest of keeping the S/N
