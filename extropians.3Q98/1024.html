Won't extended life worsen overpopulation problems?

<p>
Overpopulation is something we would have to come to terms with even
if life-extension were not to happen. Some people blame technology for
having given rise to the problem of overpopulation. Another way of
looking at it is to consider that were it not for technology then most
people alive today would not have existed -- including the ones that
are complaining about overpopulation! Were we to stop using modern
agrecultural technologies, such as tractors, fertilizers and
pesticides, most humans would soon die of starvation. It's worth
thinking twice before calling something a "problem" when owe our very
existence to it.

<p>
 This is in no way to deny that too rapid population growth causes
 crowding, poverty and depletion of natural resources. In this sense
 there is a very real problem. Efforts to promote education about
 family-planning and contraception, especially in the poorest
 countries (where population growth is fastest), should be vigorously
 supported. The constant attempts by some religious pressure groups in
 the United States to block these humanitarian efforts are seriously
 misguided in the opinion of transhumanists.

<p>
 We can also be hopeful that scientists will be able to keep up with
 the increasing demands of a growing world population. For example, we
 have just begun unlocking the potential of genetic engineering.
 (Cloning is just one very helpful method in genetic engineering.)
 It's impossible to foretell exactly how far that will take us, but it
 is already clear that it will enable us, among other things, to
 substantially increase crop yield and effectiveness in animal
<a name="1070qlink1"><a name="1043qlink1"> husbandry. If we could design cattle without brains or with just the
 brain stem, we would have a way of producing meat without maltreating
 animals (the brainless bodies wouldn't count as animals). The human
 yuck-feeling (probably temporary) would have to be weighed against
 the permanent reduction in animal suffering.</a></a>

<p>
 One thing that the environmentalists are right about is that the
 status quo is unsustainable. Things cannot, as a matter of physical
 necessity, remain the way they are today indefinitely or even for
 very long.  If we continue to use up resources like we currently do
 then we will run into serious shortages sometime in the first half of
 the next century that will force the world economy to contract and
 the world population to decrease drastically. The deep greens have an
 answer to this: they suggest we try to turn the clock back and return
 to an idyllic pre-industrial age in harmony with nature. The problem
 is that the pre-industrial age was anything but idyllic - poverty,
 misery, disease, heavy manual toil from dawn to dusk, superstitious
 fear and cultural parochialism. Also, it's hard to see how more than
 a few hundred million people could be maintained at a reasonable
 standard of living with pre-industrial production methods, so 90% of
 the world population would somehow have to get rid of.

<p>
 Transhumanists propose a much more realistic alternative: not to go
 backward but to push ahead as hard as we can. The environmental
 problems that technology creates are problems of intermediary,
 inefficient technology. Technologically less advanced industries in
 the former Soviet-block pollute much more than their Western
 counterparts. High-tech industry is relatively benign. When we
 develop molecular nanotechnology we will not only have perfectly
 clean and efficient production of most any commodity but we will also
 be able to clean up the mess created by today's crude production
 methods. This sets a standard for a clean environment that
 transhumanists challenge any environmentalist to try to match.

<p>
 Nanotechnolgy will also make it cheap to colonize space. From a
 cosmic point-of-view, Earth is a totally insignificant little speck.
 It has been suggested that we ought to leave space untouched and
 preserve it in its pristine glory. This view is hard to take
 seriously. Every hour, through entirely natural processes, huge
 amounts of resources - thousands of times more than the total of what
 the human species has used throughout its career - are transformed
<a name="1070qlink2"> into radioactive substances or wasted as radiation escaping into
<a name="1043qlink2"> intergalactic space. Whoever was in charge of this project could
 probably have done with a little bit more accountability!</a></a>

<p>
 Even with full-blown space colonization, however, population growth
 can continue to be a problem. If the expansion speed is limited by
 the speed of light then the amount of resources under human control
 will only grow polynomially. Population on the other hand can easily
 grow exponentially. If that happens then the average income will
 eventually be drop to the Malthusian subsistence level, which will
 force population growth to slow down. How soon this would happen
 depends primarily on reproduction rates.  Increases in average life
 span does not have a big effect. Even vastly improved technology can
 only postpone the inevitable for a relatively brief time. The only
 long-term solution is population control restricting the number new
<a name="1043qlink3"> persons created per year. This does not mean that population could
 not grow; only that the growth would have to be polynomial rather
 than exponential.</a>
