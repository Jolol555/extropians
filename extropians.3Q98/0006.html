The problem with the internet (web, email, netnews, irc) is the bulk of
material you have to read on your screen everyday and the difficulty of
reading words on the computer screen.

<p>
I think short paragraphs and whitespace and being brief helps.

&gt; What are your most effective sources of information on the internet?<br>


<OL>
  <li>  web - high quality
  <li>  email lists - low quality of info
  <li>  netnews - even lower quality of info
  <li>  irc - the lowest of the low :)


</OL>
<p>
&gt; How did you find those sources?<br>

<p>
by browsing :-)

<p>
I tried the Alexa thing which was OK, Netscape will build this in 
to 4.5 I think.

<p>
&gt; How do you make use of those sources?<br>

<p>
I have a large number of bookmarks, which I now try to keep organised.
Netscape has good features for doing this.

<p>
I browse certain sites daily (eg. <a href="http://www.wired.com">http://www.wired.com</a>), since these
are often good overviews.  Few sites are actually updated this frequently.

<p>
&gt; Do you use filters or robots as an aid to processing material obtained <br>
&gt; from the internet?<br>

<p>
Not generally.  I trust people more than robots and the software I tried
didn't seem to work very well.

<p>
I use filters in slrn to autoselect people's postings on netnews by name
(people with good reputation that write well - rare).  Netnews is now
pretty useless except through <a href="http://www.dejanews.com/">http://www.dejanews.com/</a>
