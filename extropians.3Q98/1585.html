hi!

<p>
<a href="1583.html#1585qlink1">&gt; Pyramids are simple and work if done right</a><br>
how can pyramid scams ever work when there is finite number of people
!!!!
<br>
it works for the few on the top that started the scheme or came in
early.
<br>
but it won't work for anybody coming in too late since they won't be
able
<br>
to find the other five or whatever to get there money from. so they
indeed
<br>
will be ripped off...


<p>
<a href="1583.html#1585qlink2">&gt;I think they're a good idea, it redistributes the wealth, and in many cases works out.  </a><br>
it increases wealth for those who start the scam, that's all. do you
happen to know
<br>
anybody personally who ever made serious money from pyramid schemes ?
it is all based on the dream of getting a lot of money without doing
anything...


<p>
<a href="1583.html#1585qlink3">&gt; These are not called pyramids, and are not illegal, if there is a product in</a><br>
<i>&gt; exchange for the initial payment.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; The deal is, you have to convince people to</i><br>
<i>&gt; join and do the same thing you're doing.  I dunno, thats just an outline of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the impression I get.  Seems like companies with good products stay around for</i><br>
<i>&gt; much longer, and are more successful.  The idea seems like, you get 3 friends</i><br>
<i>&gt; to join, they get 3 friends, and they get 3 friends, so on.. </i><br>
so what is the difference between this and a pyramid scheme ? it is all
just the same....


<p>
yours
