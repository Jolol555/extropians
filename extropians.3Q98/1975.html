"Creation and Structure of Baby Universes in Monopole Collisions

<p>
Authors: Arvind Borde, Mark Trodden, Tanmay Vachaspati

<p>
Under certain circumstances, the collision of magnetic monopoles,
topologically locked-in regions of false vacuum, leads to topological
inflation and the creation of baby universes. The future evolution of
initial data represented by the two incoming monopoles may contain a
timelike singularity but this need not be the case. We discuss the
global structure of the spacetime associated with monopole collisions
and also that of topological inflation. We suggest that topological
inflation within magnetic monopoles leads to an eternally reproducing
universe.


<p>
What they show is that if you collide certain monopoles with each
other, they collapse into a kind of black hole with inflation,
creating a baby universe. The nice thing (if you are a tiplerite) is
that this universe seems to be closed, so if you desperately want to
have an Omega Point but the universe is open, just collide your
monopoles and send in your information into the black hole (how to do
this is usefully left as an exercise for the student); you can have
your OP inside the baby universe. Of course, nobody has ever found a
monopole yet, but at least it seems theoretically possible to make
baby universes this way."

<p>
This is what you guys are great at. Information! Stretching the 
imagination.
<br>
Daring to discuss things at the boundaries of theoretical possibility. 
This is what makes you into poets!
