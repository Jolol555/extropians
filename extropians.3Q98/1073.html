<i>&gt; My gut feeling has been that the reasons for prejudice are hard enough</i><br>

<i>&gt;wages after uploads become common, but I haven't identified such professions</i><br>
<i>&gt;with enough confidence to justify the effort.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But now that you have provoked me into thinking about it, I see some hope</i><br>
<i>&gt;that people may be influenced to increase their chances of prospering</i><br>
<i>&gt;in an era of uploads by explaining the advantages of a high savings rate</i><br>
<i>&gt;today.</i><br>

<p>
I am much more hopeful that an anticipated upload transition can be much
smoother than an unanticipated transition.  People might
1) Diversify their assets, especially investing in capital likely to be in
demand in an early upload era.
<br>
2) More explicitly buy into insurance against upload transition risks.
3) accelerate research on uploading, so the first uploads are not too fast
relative to humans. 
<br>
4) gain a clearer image of the suffering and alienation early uploads must
deal with, to mitigate jealosy.
