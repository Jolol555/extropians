That's true but I certainly don't think you'd have to go as far as putting  a 
copy of you in the same quantum state for it to be you. That's vast overkill.

Still not quite macroscopic but they are getting bigger and the progress is 
remarkable, the current record was set just this week by Daniel Kleppner and 
Tom Greytak of MIT. They put 100 million hydrogen atoms in the same quantum 
state by making a Bose Einstein condensate, what makes it even more 
impressive is that it's much harder to do it with Hydrogen than with more
massive alkali atoms. That's 10 times as many atoms as the previous record 
that was made just a few months ago.
