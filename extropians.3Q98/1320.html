 Sherry,

As I said before, I am female and for that reason maybe not the best judge of female attractiveness. But, extrapolating from what I consider to be attractive traits in a man (maybe not the safest pursuit), an attractive female would be one who was committed to her beliefs and passionate about ideas, uncompromising in her standards and single-mindedly devoted to learning and advancement. According to these criteria, I would think that ALL transhumanist females would be attractive by definition. This still does not account for the nagging fact that there aren't very MANY, though. That would have to suck for extropian guys.
