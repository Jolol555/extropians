Submission Wizard our program offers web users such as
yourself, the ability to automatically submit your site to

The submission process is very simple, efficient, and most
importantly fast. All you do is provide standard site

takes this information, and changes it into the format
required by each different engine, then registers your
web site. It's that simple!

In addition, the Wizard's database of search engines and
directories is constantly being updated every week,
thus giving your site fresh and relevant exposure. Also
the Wizard allows you to register multiple URL's.

PROMOTEONE... GET TO #1 ON THE SEARCH ENGINES NEW PUBLICATION.

<p>
One of the most asked questions that we get asked is
"How do I get my site listed to the top of the search
engines?" Like Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek, Webcrawler, HotBot,
Lycos, &amp; AltaVista, Here is the answer.

<p>
Now available "The Step by Step Guide to Successfully
Promoting a Web Site" which has been designed to teach you
everything you need to know about each of the major search
engines before you request search engines to add your web
site to their database. By combining the information you
learn from "The Guide" and by using the incredible power and
flexibility of Submission Wizard to actually list your web site,
you are well on your way to making the investment of having a
web presence start paying off.

<p>
What most people don't realize when they try to list their
web site with search engines is that each one has it's own
way of doing things. Depending on what you know ahead of time
could make the difference between finding your site or not.
