All:

Thought this'd be of interest.

<p>
Sorry that this is a bit off topic (It *does* have the word DNA in it, plus
it's really libertarian in nature of which I know there are many on this
list)

<p>
A major national current affairs program run on our government owned
national broadcaster (ABC), The 7:30 Report (16 July 98) tonight contained
the most alarming news I've heard in a long time.

<p>
You know those blood test things they do with the baby's feet at birth here
in Australia ?  (and probably everywhere else in the Western world)

<p>
We've just found out that the government have kept them all.
They now have 5 million.  (We have a population of only 18 - 20 million)


<UL>
  <li>  They are providing them to law enforcement officials on request. (That
didn't take long !)

  <li>  At the time they did the test on my kids, I asked if they were kept and
told NO. There isn't a hope in hell I'd agree otherwise, and it looked so
suspicious at the time that I asked on at least two occasions about this.

  <li>  They are being used in genetic experimentation, testing and for detailed
genetic analysis. These are NOT anonymous samples. They contain our kids
identity information. I think the audience on the extropian list would
realise
the implications of someone somewhere having a database record containing
information about your genome attached to your name. Insurance companies
would love this information - they'd know how to set your premium,
especially if the analysis had already been done for them and was included
in the file.

  <li>  Seen/read Gattica, 1984, Brave New World etc ? If you're
wondering what sort of infrastructure is required before that future can
arrive, I'll let you know the very first one - genetic imprints of all
citizens at birth.


</UL>
<p>
I've started a mailing list that I'll use to promote awareness about this.
Send an email to genethics-request@list.to with the word SUBSCRIBE in the
message body.  This internet discussion group will aim to provide a forum
where concerned parents can work towards getting our kids DNA back.

<p>
This message is being circulated widely on the internet.  There is going to
be some real people power on a genetic issue for the first time in
Australian politics.
