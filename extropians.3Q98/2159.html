<a href="1875.html#2159qlink1">&gt;Now, replace the man with our all</a><br>
powerful, all good, all knowing God.
<br>
<a href="1875.html#2159qlink2">&gt; The baby gets eaten and God does</a><br>
nothing.  Should we blame him?  He
<br>
<a href="1875.html#2159qlink3">&gt;saw the wolf coming and knew what he</a><br>
was going to do and could,
<br>
<a href="1875.html#2159qlink4">&gt;according to our definition, stop it.</a><br>
Our "God" is also all good, so
<br>
<a href="1875.html#2159qlink5">&gt;how can he let this happen?  Obviously</a><br>
there is something wrong with
<br>
<a href="1875.html#2159qlink6">&gt;our definition of God.  Or perhaps with</a><br>
good.  If God isn't all good
<br>
<a href="1875.html#2159qlink7">&gt;or all powerful or all knowing, is he</a><br>
worthy of our mindless worship?

<p>
We had to make a truckload of (astute)
<br>
assumptions to arrive here. I enjoyed
<br>
the ride. But it
<br>
doesn't matter, because God does not
<br>
exist (as his brother, I should know
<br>
&lt;g&gt;). This explains how
<br>
God can let this happen. He can let
<br>
anything happen. He doesn't exist. God
<br>
can have whatever
<br>
attributes any hallucinating brain
<br>
assigns to God.

<p>
As you probably know, people invented
<br>
God so that they could continue their
<br>
lives without the stress
<br>
involved in recognizing and
<br>
acknowledging their own mortality...
<br>
their own eventual dive into
<br>
oblivion. We can easily understand the
<br>
motive of belief in the supernatural.
<br>
When reason settles
<br>
into a transient life form, it has an
<br>
unsettling effect. Belief systems
<br>
assuage the discomfort of
<br>
cognitive dissonance.

<p>
Anyway, I appreciate your compelling
<br>
argument against the nonexistant God. At
the age of twelve,
<br>
many savvy kids figure out that if the
<br>
universe needs God to create it, then
<br>
God needs something to
<br>
create God.

<p>
The diety functions as a father-figure
<br>
for people who crave attention from
<br>
daddy. Sadly, too many
<br>
real live daddies don't even want to
<br>
think about attending to this hunger for
father love.

<p>
BTW, if we define God as the set of
<br>
genetic algorithms and self-organization
that results in complex
<br>
life forms and the universe they
<br>
inhabit, then God becomes more
<br>
intricate, but not more ethical.
<br>
Which means that we cannot blame the God
of self-organization and genetic
<br>
algorithms for permitting
<br>
(or, more significantly, for creating)
<br>
the cruelty in life. We should rather
<br>
thank God for rendering
<br>
us able to
