Authentication is a means of providing a tamperproof cookie for the other
party for it to check against your past dealing with that particular
party (which might be part of cookie or stored externally). When 
dealing with different parties, you can (should) use different
_volatile_ (visibility scope limited to current transaction) IDs. 
If you fail to prove your identity, the transaction is voided. E.g.,
if you fail to prove that your baggage checking history is
Semtex-clean, the airline will bar your from boarding the vehicle.

Xactly. You _will_ wind up in jail for a day if failing to produce
appropriate credentials in Moscow, Russia. (I don't carry my passport, 
and so far I've been lucky).
