<p>
If they intend to rob and kill you, then you should certainly defend
yourself with any means at your disposal.  But assume instead they only
wish to rob you; pointing your gun at them may escalate the situation
rather than resolving it in your favour.  If you misjudge them and/or their
weaponry, you may find yourself killed or badly hurt at the end of the
encounter rather than merely robbed.

<p>
Obviously it can be difficult to discern the robber's exact intent. You can
argue that your decision to use/not use your gun will be based on the
unique situation; my point is that it's easy to construct hypothetical
examples both for and against having a gun on hand. Does anyone know of a
study that compares the outcomes of a particular crime type (e.g., mugging)
between cases in which the victims had guns and those in which they did not?

<p>

<p>
I agree. I'm not necessarily in favour of severe gun controls, just
questioning the utility of owning a gun.

<p>
Presumably the brain vats would be located in a *very* secure place ;-&gt;
