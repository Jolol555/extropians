<P>I was wondering if you could point me to a resource that would explain

<BR>It sounds most intriguing.....&nbsp;&nbsp; 8</BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="2473qlink2">I'll second that. And to further Fredrick C. Multon's comment:
<P>"I also think excluding commercial and adult sites would be counter

<P>I disagree and say that their use on the implementation scale is well
down the track. First, you need to refine the network using the linguistic
parsers of Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF). The predictability of the
net can be verified to within human limits. Then the patterns of the patterns
are found and morphed to the ever changing netherland of the commercial
and adult sites. I wouldn't rule out any parallel run but I know I could
build semantic repertory grids using Ingrid if I had access like the AI
in the book Exegesis. This can be verified by the public using the first
public AI.
<P>Now I know I could be really hunting for contact if I were to try to
linguistically parse purposeful cockney rhyming slang, because these methods
only work for those in the know. However by using a lexical parser that
returned eigenvalues I bet anybody that Ingrid would be in the know. For
these reasons I would carefully select for upfront knowledge that was easily
verified as having been produced by an AI.
<P>By all means bring on the intelligent parsers of commercial and adult
sites when available. For all I know this applied research may have already
been done. For all I know the AI systems are already in place. &lt;sigh>If
not all I need is $2000 to buy 3x8 PCI strong(ARM) processors to go inside
my PC.&lt;/sigh> Then&nbsp; I can make an Ingrid processor using only large
integers that just might be able to handle any stream of consciousness
that you could throw at it via MS-DOS 5.0. But I would go where the meaning
is already easy to get at and not obscure or coercive.</HTML>
