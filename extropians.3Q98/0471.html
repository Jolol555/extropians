<i>&gt; move</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;in their old neighborhood, or are looking for virgin territory to fleece? Are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you gonna move someplace else? And someplace else again? and again? and</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;When do you stop running and start shooting back?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; worry too much about them.  It's silly to underestimate risks, yes, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; over-estimating them is also a mistake.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0525qlink4">Refusing to prepare for either is the biggest mistake you can make,</a> because you
<a name="0525qlink5">can never estimate anything with much precision. A number of wize</a> old people have
<a name="0525qlink6">said on various occasions, when asked how they lived so long, and were so
successful, "If you prepare for the worst, and prepare for the best,</a> anything that
<a name="0525qlink7">happens you will be prepared to handle with ease."</a>

<p>
<a href="0446.html#0471qlink3">&gt; &gt;Yes, why is Mutual Assured Destruction a fine policy for nation states but</a><br>
<i>&gt; not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;for individual people? Its worked fine for 50 years around the world, I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that a personal policy of micro-MAD is a fine survival policy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Some societies manage to get along quite well without micro-MAD; perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; nation states find it it a good policy because there is no real</i><br>
<i>&gt; meta-authority to keep them in line, analogous to legal systems within</i><br>
<i>&gt; nations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0525qlink8">Some societies get along fine without a built in, implied micro-MAD policy in
their culture/government, but only in the short term. Such</a> societies always tend
<a name="0525qlink9">to either self-destabilize due to a lack of internal checks and balances,</a> or are
<a name="0525qlink10">interfered with by an outside party. You can praise the fine, pro-gun-control
societies in Europe all you want, and they may be quaint places to visit,</a> but they
<a name="0525qlink11">always seem to need rescuing every few decades when their quaint</a> ideas delaminate
<a name="0525qlink12">from reality. I think that the only thing that has kept Europe</a> from degrading into
<a name="0525qlink13">a continent wide version of yugoslavia is the implied threat that US forces
represent.</a>

<p>
<a name="0525qlink14">Even the most civil society must have an implied threat of force</a> on the part of
<a name="0525qlink15">the individual members of that society to hold it together,</a> and to protect it from
<a name="0525qlink16">threats from higher authorities or from outside forces. If</a> you beleive that all
<a name="0525qlink17">power originates in the individual, then the individual must be prepared and
willing to take responsibility for the management of that power, no</a> matter how
<a name="0525qlink18">much he or she has delegated it. They must also personally</a> take responsibility for
<a name="0525qlink19">defending the power which they have not delegated to their governments.</a> Anything
<a name="0525qlink20">less is head-in-the-sand abdication of the individual as the source of power.</a>
