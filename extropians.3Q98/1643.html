<a name="1669qlink1">Lets say your in an uploaded condition and your an expert in a highly
<a name="1646qlink1">skilled niche field.  Now, just returning from a two week vacation, a
pile of work worth 1000 hours of time has piled up.  When this</a> work is
completed, another 2 weeks vacation have been earned.  Well, why not
spawn off 100 copies who will work for ten hours each including time
to make "lessons learned" notes.  While this work is being done go
home and unpack your bags.  Upon returning all 100 copies will
voluntarily terminate because 10 hours is not long enough to have
developed a conflict of interest.  The original only has to take the
time to read the "lessons learned" notes and go pack bags for another
two weeks vacation.  The end of the mundane - if your not doing
something interesting or your not learning you need not put yourself
through this pain.

For example, I am a radiation effects specialist for space
electronics.  Today I have 1000 hours of work on my desk, of which the
experience gained from doing it could easily be replaced with a short
"lessons learned" list. Especially one written by myself to myself. 
Just thought I would share my transhuman fantasies on a very long and
hard Tuesday.  Ahhhhh, if only I were an upload.  Okay, I'll go back
to work now.
