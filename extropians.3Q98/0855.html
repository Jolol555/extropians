No, there are still four walls. You said that if
the two copies pointed left, they'd be pointing at
different walls. I am merely asking how you *know*
they are different walls.</a> Considering their are

identical data. Since they are both pointing to
their left and seeing their copy point to
its right. Why is there a divergence?</a>

<a name="0864qlink4">"selectively editing [your] responses to eliminate

location. I apologise if I can be accused of any
arrogance or dishonesty, this is certainly not
what I intending.</a>

<p>
I had hoped the idea of the room would help
concrete the image of two identical entities
acting as redundancy. It works for me, but I am of
a biased viewpoint (as are you).

<p>
<a href="0818.html#0855qlink2">&gt; A square contains only one side?  A rectangle</a><br>

<i>&gt; triangle has two sides and an asymmetrical</i><br>
<i>&gt; triangle has three sides?</i><br>

<p>
No, a square has four sides, a rectangle four, and
so on. In my thought experiment you simply cannot
distinguish between the identity and location of
the walls, and thus the copies will not diverge.

<p>
<a href="0818.html#0855qlink3">&gt; You are the one with strange theories of</a><br>

<p>
So:

<p>
<a name="0864qlink5">What makes the walls different in this test?
How can we tell they are different?</a>
<br>
<a name="0864qlink6">How do you know there are two different people?
