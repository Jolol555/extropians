I think they offer Ph.D.s in The Philosophy of Science to address this
question so it is, of course, presumptious to attempt to boil it all down to
a simple explanation.  But I've been presumptious before.

<p>
To me, it's all about prediction and repeatable results.  Generally, if you
produce results or make observations  that no one else can, even after
repeated attempts using the same methodology you did, it's not
scientifically sound.  Psychics are right occasionally, intermittently
reinforcing (the most powerful reinforcement schedule) those who are
predisposed to believe.  Rational and systematic skepticism is the
epistemolgical key.

<p>
Science was probably an inevitable process for us to develop.  I submit that
we tend to devote the larger percentage of our mental energies toward
answering three questions over and over again; (1) What's next?
(prediction), (2) What does it have to do with me? (relevance), and (3) What
can I do about it? (control).  Anxiety lies at or very near the core of
human nature, and anxiety is eased to the degree that we can satisfy our
needs for prediction, relevance, and control.  Of course, for some ignorance
is bliss, but not for most.

<p>
<a name="1872qlink1">But back to your question. Does science hold all the answers.  Yes.  Science
is our best methodology for eventually finding all the answers.</a>

<p>
BTW, I would love to make it to Houston for the First Annual Textropian
Conference (or happy hour). Hope I can.
