In an earlier post he said.

<p>
<a href="0988.html#1097qlink1">&gt; All the "ADVANCED" and "EXTROPIC" people I know defend themselves with</a><br>
<i>&gt;  disintegration rays, or, if they can't afford disintegration rays, they use</i><br>
<i>&gt;  particle beam weapons.  Anyone who is truly "ADVANCED" would rather die</i><br>
<i>&gt;  than use a primitive "gun"--that would label them for life as a backward</i><br>
<i>&gt;  hick....</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>

<p>
To which I said:

<p>
<a href="1000.html#1097qlink2">&gt;some of us use memetic replicators...</a><br>

<p>
And as serendepity would have it...I just this morning discovered an example
of other people doing it.  Using a memetic replicator I mean.

<p>
One of the many horrible, disgusting, vile and appalling  vices in which I
indulge is that I read lots of Science Fiction.  I prefer the good stuff but
I'll take just about anything when the "hunger" gets intense.

<p>
Well I've recently endured a rather long dry spell...and I'm reading
&lt;blush&gt;..."Hung Out"...by Margearet Weis and Don Perrin.

<p>
on page 198 it is said:

<p>
".....ranking somewhere above rats and rock-and-roll singers in intelligence;
equal perhaps to those other herd animals, politicians; but below the rest of
humanity."

<p>
I got a chuckle out of that...as it pretty well matches my own perspective.

<p>
But it also illustrates the "meme replicator"...perhaps one of the
oldest...but still more deadly weapons available.

<p>
Natasha  is aware of that as she said:

<p>
"And, as an aside, would you be kind enough to use "human" rather than "man."

<pre>
                ..............in another thread she critiqued (unjustifiably
</pre>
in my<a name="1106qlink1"> humble opinion)

<p>
<a name="1120qlink1">Other examples of antagonistic memetic replicators are "nigger, kike, geek,
</a>
redneck, ......truckdriver"...the list goes</a> on and on.

<p>
Some look upon it as a problem....I kinda think of it as an opportunity....and
constantly look for ways to harass and bring discomfort to my enemies. The
writers of this book...and many, many, more that I have read seem to think so
too.  I've been noticing that in my area of interest such vile scum as
politicians are not in great favor.

<p>
And they haven't figgered a way to register a memetic replicator yet...nor is
there a waiting list on it's acquistion....
