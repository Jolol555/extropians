<p>
Well, I shouldn't have said simple. After all, it leads to the 
problem of the reference class.


<p>

<a href="1827.html#1837qlink2">&gt; might have been someone else instead.  But I find it very hard to believe</a><br>

<i>&gt; Hermes in 2200.</i><br>


<p>
Let me put it like this. The amnesia heuristic sets a lower bound for 
what should be included in the reference class.

<p>
For example, it clearly makes sense to say that you might not have 
known (indeed you may not know) the exact hour of your birth. If you 
didn't know that, then you would use some probability distribution 
over possible birth hours compatible with what else you know. If you 
conditionalize this distribution on your exact birth hour, you should 
</a>
get back the distribution you held before you forgot the birth hour. 
If you don't get back the original distribution then that indicates 
that you had forgot to take account of some effect. The doomsday 
argument claims that there is such an effect that you have neglected 
to take into account.

<p>
When we're talking about forgetting about whether you are a Martian 
living on Hermes in 2200, then things get problematic. The amnesia 
heuristic seems to gradually break down. I agree with that. That's 
why there is the reference class problem.

<p>
It would be nice if it were that simple, but we're still waiting for 
a coherently specified state space. Do you have any specific cases in 
mind where the SIA would be inadequate?</a>
