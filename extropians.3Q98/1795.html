Hmm, I see no reason for all those caps. Are you trying to shout? 

<p>
If I understand your reasoning correctly, you think transhumanists are
non-rational for not discussing the possibility of uplifiting/boosting
other entities, such as animals. Is this a correct interpretation?

<p>
If so, then you are wrong, since these matters has been discussed on
this list in the past. There was a long discussion about uplifting
squids around a year ago, and there have been occasional bursts of
thinking on the ethics of the process. Not to mention David Pearce's
sketches in The Hedonic Imperative.

<a name="1796qlink2">But<a name="1886qlink1"> generally people are more interested in things that give *them*</a> or
their close ones a benefit. You might regard all entities as close
ones, but others may have other priorities. This is still completely
rational in the sense of using efficient means to reach one's goals.</a>
