This IS an interesting point.  

<p>
Suppose  that how we deal with such minor nuisances as guns be considered a
"trial run" or a "learning experience" in regards to dealing with the much
more serious "powerful tools" anticipated in the future.  

<p>
Are we learning anything?

<p>
I've heard that in a technological society it is IMPOSSIBLE to ban weapons.  I
beleive this is true.  In fact...it doesnt seem that the government is doing
all that well banning weapons (and drugs) in their prisons...much less in
society as a whole.  This would seem to indicate that no matter how many laws
are passed...nor how stringent the punishment...guns(weapons) and drugs will
still be available. 

<p>
As technology advances it would appear that the "guns and drugs" will get more
potent...AND more difficult to control.

<p>
Given this reasoning...it would appear that a method of  "living with it"
should be developed.    As has been mentioned it would seem that where there
are less restrictions on guns (concealed carry laws...certain "lenient"
states) then individuals tend to be more responsible in the use of guns.
Likewise I've been led to understand that the same logic follows in regards to
drugs.  I don't know for sure but I understand that in certain European
Countries there are much less drug restrictions than in the US and much less
"abuse".  Once again...it would appear...that increased freedom leads to
increased responsibility.

<p>
Keeping this in mind perhaps we should be working toward a more responsibile
populance...because someday sooon the REALLY nasty weapons will become
available.
