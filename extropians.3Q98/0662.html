<p>
My view is that there is no difference between two instances of "you"
and one, if they are in perfect synchrony.  My various examples are meant
to illustrate this by blurring the lines between the two.

<p>
<a name="0668qlink2">It seems implausible that doubling the width of the wires would change
one "you" into two.  So I don't see why reducing the thickness of the wires
in the simulation would make anyone cease to exist.  Perhaps my wording
above was unclear that this is what I was proposing?
