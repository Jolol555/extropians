<p>
When the exception performed to 100% it proves that it should more often be the
general case. If more people had used their guns or whatever to shut down
transportation of people during the epidemic, maybe only a small fraction of the
20 million people who died would have done so.

<p>
There was a similar policy recently in Africa during the Ebola epidemic. It seems
that the international health workers were making the epidemic worse because they
insisted on bringing infected individuals into hospitals, where they then
infected normal patients who were there only for day visits. Those people went
back to their villages and spread the epidemic. Finally the government stepped in
and enacted a policy that anyone with symptoms was restricted to their hut, and
food would be brought to their door each day. If they left they would be shot,
and if the food was untouched for three days the hut would be burned down. No
more epidemic.
