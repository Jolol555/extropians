Well, take egoism for example.  It's the easiest to adapt to this model:
egoism can be defined like this:  "You ought to do whatever is most in
your subjective interests."  Clearly this circumvents the problem you
assert above: I completely agree that a person's goals are entirely
subjective, but I can come up with a theory of practical rationality which
is compatible with it.

On the flip side of the same argument, I'd say you're asking the theory to
do more than it claims to do.  I'm not really sure what you mean by
"conquering irrationality," but having a rational theory about how to act
given a set of irrational or non-rational preferences is a non-trivial
step forward, I'd say.
