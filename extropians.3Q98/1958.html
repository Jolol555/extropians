<a href="1920.html#1958qlink1">&gt;&gt;   In fact in talking with one of the local injectionist's, my</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  friends said he remarked that a number of local flora and fauna</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  were increasing now that they were no longer being used in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  traditional aphrodisiacs.</i><br>

skeptic.... ;)

I just got back from lunch with my buddy and the story I got was
this:

<p>
 They found out about this by someone walking up to them and
offering to sell them Viagra. In the questions that followed the
guy remarked "It's even easier to sneak things out of the U.S. then
in." Apparently they've been doing it since shortly after it was
released here in the U.S. Trinidad/Tobaggo has been filled with
smugglers since the pirate days.

<p>
Apparently it's all market driven.

<p>
Since it happened before summer, most of the flora and fauna
traditionally used, weren't harvested this summer.

<p>
A good friend, a good story, a couple of hurricanes (the drink) and
a bowl of alligator etouffee' at "heaven on seven". 

<p>
Not a bad Lunch.
