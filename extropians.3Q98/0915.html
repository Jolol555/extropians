<p>
Thanks. Web connectivity is still crippled, but I'll try to access it. For
the future, please consider presenting your papers also in
nonproprietary, canonical Internet publishing format: gzipped (and 
soon bzipped?) PostScript. <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov">http://xxx.lanl.gov</a> has set de facto standards.

<p>
<a href="0896.html#0915qlink4"> &gt; 1) Humans have a vast amount of knowledge and insight, only the tiniest </a><br>
<i> &gt;    fraction of which can be expressed as equations derived from first </i><br>
<i> &gt;    principles.  It's a big mistake to say we know nothing about a subject</i><br>
<i> &gt;    if no such equations are presented.</i><br>

<p>
I think this is a dangerous position. You can't communicate intuitive
insights, verbalizations are unwieldy to prepare and even more to 
consume. A graph or a table of numbers are much more succinct, and 
less prone to misinterpretation. I'm notoriously wary of number
toters, and those who believe (analytical) mathematics is perfectly 
applicable to the real world (usually it isn't). Yet, I think much 
could be gained if there was a common communicable 
calculus/formalization. Perhaps an augmenting reality device 
(current model: wearable with a HUD/Twiddler/myopotential input) could be 
instrumental here, since requiring to be able to project graphical 
stuff upon semiintuitive cue.

<p>
<a href="0896.html#0915qlink5"> &gt; 2) Even if we knew nothing about a subject, that wouldn't mean</a><br>
<i> &gt;    we couldn't learn something if we put our minds to it.  You need a </i><br>
<i> &gt;    much stronger argument to reject inquiry other than we don't know </i><br>
<i> &gt;    anything now.</i><br>

<p>
The bulk of past predictions now seems ludicrous. A tiny minority was
more or less accurate, yet the contemporaries had not the benefits of
ours: backsight. They couldn't tell shit from shinola, nor can we now.

<p>
<a href="0896.html#0915qlink6"> &gt; 3) Human insight isn't indexed much by year of applicability.  The best</a><br>
<i> &gt;    experts in banking now know things relevant for forecasting post</i><br>
<i> &gt;    singularity banking.  People who understand art well know things </i><br>
<i> &gt;    relevant for forecasting post-singularity art.  Just becasuse there</i><br>
<i> &gt;    isn't a book called "Post-singularity banking and art" Doesn't mean </i><br>
<i> &gt;    people don't know things relevant for this.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0919qlink3"><a name="0917qlink1">If there is no banking nor art after the Singularity, extrapolating
<a name="0990qlink1">from past human insight is worth shit. If anything, a biologist
</a>
</a>
specializing in food network ecology, or an ALife researcher would be
the ones to listen to. However, point is even their forecasts are
</a>
totally unreliable.

<p>
<a href="0896.html#0915qlink7"> &gt; 4) For a subject a broad as "post-singularity", insight just isn't very</a><br>
<i> &gt;    discrete, since there is so much relevant knowledge.  We know more</i><br>
<i> &gt;    about the year 2098 now than we did in 1898, and likely will know</i><br>
<i> &gt;    more ten years from now.  Our insight improves incrementally, so </i><br>
<i> &gt;    there is no cliff beyond which we know *nothing*.  I see no</i><br>
<i> &gt;    "horizons," analogous to where the curve of the Earth makes human </i><br>
<i> &gt;    visual resolution suddenly fall to uselessness. </i><br>

<p>
My interpretation of the Singularity is that you do not see nothing
unusual if you traverse it as an observer (provided, personae persist
during the process), things just grow a lot more hectic, as does the 
rat race. However, you emerge a god from the other side (orelse the
Singularity has not occured, and even relatively conservative
predictions are perfectly applicable), which is perfectly
incomprehensible for an nonparticipating mehum observer. This all 
assuming there is a thing as a Singularity, of course. 

<p>
ciao,
