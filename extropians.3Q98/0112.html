Now children, what's the difference between terrorists and freedom fighters?

<p>
Yes, that's right, terrorists are freedom fighters that the government
doesn't like... freedom fighters are terrorists who the government likes.

<p>
Most terrorist groups (aside from those who are merely criminal, including
the ones run by governments to defame their opponents) see themselves as
freedom fighters, regardless of what the rest of the world may think. If
you ignore that, you'll never understand why they do what they do.

<p>
Really? If you don't oppress people or support groups who do, then what
reason do freedom fighters have to attack you? You, of course, support 
the US government, one of the most hated and oppressive organisations on
the planet, so I'm not surprised you're worried about "terrorists".
