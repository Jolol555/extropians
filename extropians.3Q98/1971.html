<a name="1979qlink1">Tastes differ.  I read the first two books for the Mars trilogy and--a rarity,
<a name="1978qlink1">for me--decided against reading the last.  While I enjoyed the hard sci-fi
approach to the mega-scale engineering issues, I found Robinson's grasp of
social institutions utterly implausible.  In particular, his weakness in
matters economic fairly well ruined the story line for me.  A planet-wide
barter system?  One based on gifting?  Feh.  Perhaps not every sci-fi author
needs to master the basics of economics, but those who, like Robinson, tackle
the topic need to get it right.</a>
</a>

<p>
Additionally, Robinson's hard sci-fi largely ignores some of the most
interesting issues to Extropians: computational advances and nanotech.  His is
<a name="1978qlink2">a very old-fashioned sort of sci-fi, both in terms of technology and "rule of
the experts" economics.  I found it unconvincing and out-of-date.</a>
