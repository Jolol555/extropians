Is this the same Doomsday Argument which has been mentioned here before?
Basically that we'd expect on average to be born half-way through the
human race, so half of us must have been born by now?

<p>

AI is hard and uploads are easy then most future life will originate from uploaded humans. In that case, even though the vast majority of life has
yet to be "born" (i.e. forked off from another upload) many of those SIs

through the *organic* human race<a name="1445qlink3"> because any SIs would have memories of
once being organics.

<p>
In fact I could take this argument to extremes and point out that since
I'm currently inhabiting this body I must be the person fated to become
the first SI and take over the universe (if you believe that is inevitable).
