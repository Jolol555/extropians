Education is one of the most lucrative products there currently is. Considering
the creeping credentialism and all that that capitalism espouses which is now in
the ascendant, it isn't a matter of being educated but it is the 'being
qualified' that counts most to the bureaucratic accumulators. The real problem
<a name="2026qlink1">that needs addressing is the actual concept of monetary wealth.</a> To this end, the
<a name="2026qlink2">high dimensionality of constructivist AI will inevitably subvert the
capitalist's accounting methodology. In the meantime the 'money talk'</a> that scams
<a name="2026qlink3">daily from every nook and cranny of public space will become so</a> nauseating that
<a name="2026qlink4">the human race will finally become sensitized against this obscene entity.</a> When
<a name="2026qlink5">this happens, hopefully the timing will be such that the money collaborators
will not be able to stare down this new form of intelligence.</a>

Speaking of which, does anyone here remember the electoral fright that started
the current round of economic meltdowns from way over there in Thailand. That's
right; - a monk who had taken a vow of poverty almost won control of the Thai
parliament.
