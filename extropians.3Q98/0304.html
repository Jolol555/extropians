I heard about a geology department considering hiring a new (untenured) 
professor.  He was a creationist, but the committee decided that his religous
beliefs didn't effect his work, which was excellent.  So they hired him.

<p>
Part of the reason odd religous beliefs can persist so long is the ability
of people to partition those beliefs, so they don't actually much influence
practical choices.
