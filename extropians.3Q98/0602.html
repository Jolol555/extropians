<a href="0591.html#0602qlink1">&gt;Suppose the computer has redundancy internally so that everything is</a><br>
<i>&gt;duplicated, two copies of each processor side by side, likewise for </i><br>
memory
<br>
<a href="0591.html#0602qlink2">&gt;elements, communication circuits, etc.  You are run on such a computer.</a><br>
<i>&gt;Someone proposes to remove some element of the redundancy so that</i><br>
<i>&gt;there will no longer be this internal duplication.  Will this kill you?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0612qlink1">Further to someone's point eariler that there are two points of view 
involved here, mine and my double's:

<p>
Is it meaningful to speak of two POV's when we have two, carefully 
synchronized virtual worlds happening here?</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;From my POV (as the virtual person who is not being deleted) I would </i><br>
have no problem, since I maintain continuity of experience.

<p>
<i>&gt;From the POV of the deleted-me, I'm not certain. It seems to me there is </i><br>
a difference between death and lack of continuity of experience.

<p>
Part of the difference here is with the idea of discrete clock ticks. If 
I were to cease to exist between "clock-ticks" of the universe, then by 
definition, I would never know. It would be like turning off the lights.

<p>
I feel, intuitively, that erasing one's percieved existence may be on a 
different moral level then murder. Again, lack of continuity of 
experience is not the same as death.

<p>
Why do I get the distinct feeling I'm defending this really badly? :)
