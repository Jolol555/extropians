  IAN: Or how about: "Turn in your guns
<br>
  or I'll shoot you" ?  The case for gun
  CONTROL is a case FOR guns, specifically
  for one group (the Govt) having them all
  and one group (The People) having none.
  Power to The People, er, I mean Govt!

<a href="0529.html#0544qlink2">&gt;Hatred begets hatred,  violence begets violence and guns beget guns...</a><br>


<p>
  IAN: It's a clear error to imply that 
  gun control is anti-gun, when it is 
<br>
  definitionally pro-gun-fascism. When
<br>
  has a law been enforced by a Govt 
<br>
  that used no guns to enforce the law?

<p>
  It's like Karl Marx's "anti-Capitalism"
  based upon the Communist Party Platform 
  that states in its fifth plank:

<pre>
     "Centralization of credit in the 
     hands of the State, by means of 
     a national bank with state capital 
     and an exclusive monopoly."

</pre>
<p>
   "Anti-gun" laws are as "anti-gun" 
<br>
   as communism was "anti-capital."

<p>
   In short, the "anti" in "anti-X law"
<br>
   doesn't refer to the 100% abolition
<br>
   of X, but rather the transfer of 
<br>
   All X to the central authorities...
<br>
   a phoney pretext for totalitarianism:
