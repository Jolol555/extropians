CHAOS-BASED COMPUTING, a fundamentally new way to 
perform computations by exploiting the ubiquitous phenomenon of 
chaos, has been demonstrated in a simulation by researchers in India 
and the United States (Bill Ditto, Georgia Tech, 404-894-5216). 
Compared to digital computation, the chaos-based technique might 
come closer to how the brain performs computation, and might be 
superior in certain tasks such as pattern recognition. The computer 
consists of an interconnected grid of "chaotic elements," systems 
such as ammonia lasers which can generate unpredictable signals 
even though their behavior is governed by known mathematical 
equations. To encode specific numbers into each element, the 
researchers make specific signal patterns correspond to a number 
and ask each element to open its connection to the rest of the grid 
when it generates that pattern. Sending its signal out to the grid can 
trigger activity in neighboring elements. To carry out specific 
operations such as addition, the researchers connect the elements in 
a certain way. An unpredictable but deterministic avalanche of 
activity among the elements ultimately settles down to produce an 
unvarying signal that corresponds to the desired answer. Having 
demonstrated their technique in a computer simulation, the 
researchers are planning to test this idea with chaotic ammonia 
lasers and hybrid networks of nerve cells and silicon chips. (Sinha 
and Ditto, Physical Review Letters, 7 September 1998.)
