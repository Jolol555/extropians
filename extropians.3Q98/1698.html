<i>&gt; and won't do all those neat things you planned); does anyone know of any </i><br>

There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons a few years ago where
Calvin creates (imaginary?) duplicates using his cardboard-box duplicator,
expecting them to do his chores, homework, etc.  He is dismayed to find
that they are no more eager to do these things than he is.  Then when
they misbehave, it's Calvin who gets in trouble.  Nobody believes him
when he says that it was a duplicate who was bad.
