Yes, you're right, I misread the message. But
other people still disagreed with me, so no loss
on my part.

I doubt (I could be wrong) the military is looking
into the application of AI as weapon itself,
although they certainly will use it for
<br>
controlling current weapons and for strategic
planning. If military AI did give one side a
massive advantage (most likely the US) things
would probably have time to even out (the US isn't
known for it's conquering). I think some of the
comments I've made apply here. For instance, would
a corporation use (to coin a term) AI-munitions or
is it more likely to stick within in the realms of
sales and marketing? How many corporations built
nuclear weapons during the arms race?

<p>
Uploading is something that is certainly not taken
seriously by any of these organisations. Uploading
is likely to come as a result of unrelated
research and will not be considered as a weapon. I
don't think its potential is that obvious.
Uploading, despite being the topic of conversation
here and in SF, will be largely ignored by most
people. I can see uploading being announced on
news like cloning - they've managed to simulate a
monkey in exact detail on a computer or something.
Most people will ask what the point is. A few of
us will talk about its potential. There'll be
moral outcry, an ethical commission will advice a
ban, the US will do it, and everyone else will
follow.

<p>
And then there's molecular nanotechnology. I've
always been sceptical of a MNT singularity (in the
short run). I've never understood why people think
that after the first assembler there'll be a
sudden outburst of new technology. MNT
<br>
dramatically reduces the cost of production and
increases the strength to weight and complexity of
products. You still have design problems and
you're likely to need all those new software
breakthroughs to be able to manage the complexity
of some of the more radical projects. I think the
MNT revolution will be fast, but not so fast that
one dominant power will emerge.

<p>
Besides, all these fields are far from being
monopolised, if you really think people are going
to get screwed just make sure you're the one doing
the screwing.
