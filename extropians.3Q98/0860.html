Yes.

<p>
No. If the table is moved to one side the  room is no longer symmetrical.

<p>
If you have an innate asymmetry and a passion for moving things to the right 
and I put you into a symmetrical room you will soon rearrange things so that 
the room is no longer symmetrical. If I put both you and your copy facing 
each other in such a room you will both  engage in your respective hobby but 
your activities will cancel each other out and the room will remain 
symmetrical, both will receive the exact same information from their senses
so nothing will diverge. If they're side by side then, contrary to what you 
said, they can find a way to agree on a direction to move the table, however 
things will rapidly become asymmetrical and so the two will diverge into 
separate beings.

<p>
<a name="0865qlink1">In example  with them facing each other the fingers of the two will indeed be
pointing toward different walls but I don't find that disturbing, if one copy 
was in London  and the other in Paris they would also be pointing at 
different walls, but as long as the walls are identical the information 
received from the walls will be the same and no divergence will happen. 
If you have doubts that  the information really is the same then convert it
to a binary sequence and  see if the train of ones and zeros is the same.</a>

<p>
In none of these scenarios does the position of the brain of the "original" 
or the "copy" make the slightest difference, only the information the brains 
receive is important and that's a function of the position of the sense  
organs.


<p>

It's far beyond today's technology but Nanotechnology could do it and I know 
of no law of Physics that would make Nanotechnology impossible.

<i>        &gt;way to end up in a mechanical body.  </i><br>


<p>
I'd like to do it that way too, at least if I was one of the very early  
uploaders, the reason is very practical, it would be the best way to catch  
small bugs in the replacement protocol before they became large bugs.  
Philosophically speaking however the speed of the change would make no  
difference.
