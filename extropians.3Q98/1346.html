<p>
This is a good opportunity to state that this extropian list, sponsored by
ExI does not require those who post on it to be members of ExI.  

<p>
Thus, let's not assume that the type of postings that are insulting to
women - transhumans or otherwise - are representational of ExI.

<p>
I do agree with Kathryn's statement:

<p>
<a href="1340.html#1346qlink1">&gt;PLEASE LISTEN to this.  You have </a><br>
<i>&gt;GOT to STOP singling out females as (1) a goal for recruitment, (2) </i><br>
<i>&gt;fodder for cyberbabe fantasies and (3) expectations of mating.  We just </i><br>
<i>&gt;want to show up and interact intellectually like the men get to do.  If </i><br>
<i>&gt;we do not get to interact intellectually, if we are constant targets </i><br>
<i>&gt;for special attention, comeons, and retaliation after we 'reject' you, </i><br>
<i>&gt;then we are going to walk.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1340.html#1346qlink2">&gt;This behavior has driven women out of here before,</a><br>

<p>
<a name="1357qlink1">To be sure some women have left this list because of the inappropriate
statements about women.  However, I know of no women who has left ExI
because of this.  Most extropian women are not on this list.</a>

<p>
Let us treat women with respect, individuality and *without* PC gender
balance or for viewing tits and ass.  

<p>
I am on this list for examining ideas, advancing my thinking spreading
extropic memes and meeting new transhuman extropic friends.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Natasha Vita More
