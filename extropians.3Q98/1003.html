Abstract
<br>
  A diet supplemented with flaxseed, rich in alpha-linolenic acid and plant
  lignans (the latter, potent platelet-activating factor receptor antagonists),
  was tested in a murine model of lupus nephritis. MRL/lpr female mice (n = 25)
  were fed 15% flaxseed diet for 14 weeks commencing at 10 weeks of age. As
  controls, 30 MRL/lpr mice received a standard rodent diet without flaxseed.
  Isotope-glomerular filtration rate (14C-inulin clearance) was measured at 9,
  16, and 24 weeks of age. Proteinuria was assessed at 2-week intervals. Spleen
  lymphocyte proliferation, quantitated by DNA analysis, was evaluated using
  flow cytometry at 9, 13, 19, and 21 weeks of age. Mortality was recorded
  throughout the study. Glomerular filtration rate at 16 weeks was greater in
  flaxseed-fed mice (0.15 +/- 0.03 mL/min) compared with controls (0.06 +/-
  0.04 mL/min; P = 0.01). The onset of proteinuria (Albustix, Ames Division,
  Miles Laboratories, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada; &gt; or = 2+) was delayed by 4
  weeks in the flax-treated mice. The percentage of flaxseed-fed mice with
  proteinuria was lower than the control mice up to 21 weeks of age (39% v 58%;
  P = 0.01). Spleen lymphocyte proliferation (percentage of cells in S-phase)
  at 13 weeks of age was significantly higher in the control group (22.9 +/-
  5.0, P = 0.01) but not in the flaxseed group (17.2 +/- 4.9) compared with
  baseline (9 weeks of age) values (13.0 +/- 3.5). Mortality was lower in the
  flaxseed-fed mice versus the control mice (assessed by Mantel-Haenszel
  (log-rank) test; P &lt; 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
