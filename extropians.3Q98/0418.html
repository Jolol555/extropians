<p>
&gt;However, if so, then there is nothing making me "me." I'm not sure if
that's a soul or what.

<p>
Our present notions of "consciousness" are vague and leave a lot to be
desired. AFAIK, the only thing that makes "me" "me" is the belief that I am
"me". IMHO, this is a software loop in my brain, whose main use is in
social relations.

<p>
<a href="0250.html#0418qlink1">&gt; Think about this, if it is just the setup of my brain,</a><br>

<p>
While (1)
<pre>
	{
		"I exist"
	}

</pre>
<p>
Though many would dispute this, I suspect the C word is this and little
else...

<p>
&gt; when given a spark (or if it is naturally there from the mother) that<br>
causes ‘me' to be, and if that *can be changed beforehand* by nanomachines
that ‘fool' the original cells into giving them the consciousness,

<p>
You have just repeated the Cartesian fallacy, see Dennet's "Consciousness
Explained". There is no spark needed, merely the execution of the "me"
process.

<p>
<a href="0250.html#0418qlink2">&gt; what is stopping my consciousness from forming in your brain?</a><br>

<p>
Only that my memories differ from yours.
