In a message dated 98-08-10 08:25:24 EDT, you write:

<p>
&lt;&lt; Considering that current rocket technology only allows a mass fraction of
around
<br>
.95, that means that for every ton you put in orbit, you expend 19 tons in
fuel
<br>
and boosters getting it there. In order to cancel all of a spacecraft's
velocity
<br>
so that it can just 'free fall' to earth from altutude, you would essentially
need
<br>
to carry an equal amount of fuel into orbit as you used for the original
blastoff.
<br>
Since you also need to launch that fuel and boosters by the same mass
fraction,
<br>
then you would increase the size, mass and cost of your original launcher by
at
<br>
least 19 times....so while its possible, its not cost effective.

<a name="1351qlink1">I understand, I thought it would take less fuel since the operation would be
done in a vacuum.  The idea is still there, for when we have the opportunuity
to slow it down without using or bringing extra fuel, there would be more
possibilities in a vacuum to do something like that, perhaps laser technology
or some kind of waveform, using satellites.
