<p>
I noticed a comment about Soleri's work and just wanted to add =
something.  Although his writing is a bit too vague at times he has a =
lot of value to offer Transhumanist philosophy.  Not only are his =
architectural and communal goals pretty much aligned with the focused =
evolution of mankind, (and in a way overlooked by a lot of =
individual-oriented rationalists), his theological framework &lt;uh oh&gt; =
helps make sense (a little) out of western eschatologies (Christianity =
especially).  Now, I have had trouble critically analyzing his work of =
this nature, but it does offer some perspective (if it is lacking in =
scientific support).  Also the Paradox Seminar at Arcosanti has been =
host to many Nanotech and advanced Computer Science gurus among other =
<pre>
intellectual leaders.                       Anyway I hope some of this =
</pre>
is relevant :)
