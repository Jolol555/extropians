Yeah, he is pretty sharp. Since current US govt costs are $10,000 per pound,
he would bring it down to $2,000 per lb, which is in line with the cheapest
Chinese and Russian launchers. The biggest benefit of his system in this
respect is that since the US govt has a law that all US launches of US
payloads using imported launchers from China or Russia must still be charged
at least 95% of the charge that the lowest domestic launcher would cost,
Hudson's project will bring back a lot of launches into the US that are
currently being performed by the Chinese and Russians for US multinational
corps in their home countries, so it will mostly benefit the Mission
Controllers union here in the US, making more jobs for US technicians....
