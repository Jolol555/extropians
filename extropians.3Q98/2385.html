<a name="2386qlink1">This sounds correct as far as it goes, but it neglects one crucial aspect
of quantum computing: getting an answer out of the machine with a large
probability (or in a large fraction of universes, in the many-worlds
interpretation).</a>

<p>
Typically the QC is put into an initial state as a superposition of all
possible inputs and then runs through the problem so that the resulting
state is a similar superposition of all possible answers.  In this sense
it would seem that the QC, taken as a whole over all branches/universes,
is able to solve all NP problems.  The problem is that the answer is in
only one branch.  If you just measure the output register, you get state
function collapse and the probability that you will see the desired
answer is too small.  So actually the QC is not effectivelly able to
work as an NP problem solver.

<p>
What has to be done is to maintain coherence and do some trick to
amplify the probability of the right answer.  Such tricks have been
discovered for factoring and discrete logs (Shor's algorithm) and for
search (Grover's algorithm).  But they are complex and technical and do
not apply to general problems.

<a href="2377.html#2385qlink2">&gt; &gt; Robin Hanson had an interesting article on the polymath list speculating</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that quantum computing could theoretically speed up AI very dramatically.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This only works if AI can be expressed as a massive search problem,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; consolidating many small problems into very large superproblems.  Search</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of n items for an optimum can be done in sqrt(n) time using QCs so it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is necessary to work on very large problems to get effective speedups.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As far as I can tell, qubit-chunk QC doesn't help AI at all.  If Hanson can</i><br>
<i>&gt; figure out how to get sqrt(n) out of it, he's way ahead of me.  I haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt; finished the QCL language spec, but I can't visualize doing anything but very</i><br>
<i>&gt; dense mathematical problems.  Maybe some network-optimization problems could</i><br>
<i>&gt; be encoded, but I can't see, say, quantum Deep Blue.</i><br>

<p>
The sqrt(n) speedup is due to Grover's algorithm, and I have to admit
that I was not able to understand Grover's paper.  He repeatedly does
some kind of transform, each time slightly amplifying the probability of
finding the right answer when you read the register.  You do this sqrt(n)
times and then you can read the output register with a good probability
of success.

<p>
A popularized discussion of Grover's algorithm and its application
to cryptography is at <a href="http://jya.com/qshake.htm">http://jya.com/qshake.htm</a>.  There was also an
article in the August 7 issue of Science.  BTW the new government
standard algorithm to replace the DES, called AES, requires support
for 256 bit keys, apparently at least in part because of fear of QCs.
It would still take 2^128 work for a QC to find such a key, which is
considered to be safe enough.
