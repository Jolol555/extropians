<a href="1356.html#1378qlink1">&gt;I am one of a select few extropians who has not read very many science</a><br>
<i>&gt;fiction novels.  I would like to change that.  I am open to any</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggestions; however, I think it's pretty obvious I'm looking to get into</i><br>
<i>&gt;quality sci-fi with distinctively Extropian leanings.</i><br>


<p>
I used to read a lot of sci-fi years ago, then stopped and have recently got
back into the habit again
<br>
pleasantly surprised at how much the market has grown.
I am currently reading Neuromancer which is more techno-dystopian than
extropian
<br>
but a fascinating book nonetheless (yes I know, as I said I've just got back
into it so
<br>
I'm a bit behind).
<br>
I was also pleasantly suprised at the proliferation of libertarian SF.
The classic libertarian SF is of course Atlas Shrugged (which I also much
prefer to the
<br>
Fountainhead).
<br>
I also highly recommend The Probability Broach by L. Neil Smith, a ripping
good yarn,
<br>
though it is almost wholly libertarian rather than extropian.
There are predictions of some extropian technologies in Greg Bear's Queen of
Angels which
<br>
is also very impressive in its treatment of the sentience of artificial
lifeforms though to my knowledge
<br>
Gre Bear isn't libertarian or extropian.
Another famous sci-fi writer, Gregory Benford, used to be on the editorial
board of Reason magazine.
