Subject: Update: Showtime's Passion of Ayn Rand

<p>
Dear listmembers:

<p>
Barbara Branden recently published, in Liberty magazine
<br>
(www.libertysoft.com/liberty/), a letter to John Hospers detailing her<br>
experience with Showtime's adaptation of The Passion of Ayn Rand.  It
sounds like the movie, filmed in January and February of this year, could
have an unusually positive effect on public understanding of the
Objectivist movement.

<p>
Both Barbara and Bill Bradford (of Liberty) have granted permission to
distribute her letter on this list, and in addition Barbara has supplied me
with a considerable amount of text which was inadvertantly omitted from the
version published in Liberty.  The fuller version is below.

<p>
Enjoy,

<p>
Joshua

<p>
Dear John,

<p>
I intended to be in Toronto for only a week during the filming of The
Passion of Ayn Rand -- but after two days on the set, I knew that no power
on earth could tear me away until the shoot ended. I am having a more
wonderful time than I ever dreamed possible. 

<p>
Howard Korder’s script is excellent, and I am constantly being asked to
write bits of copy -- which means that I get material into the script that
I had wanted in. The cast is marvelous; Helen Merrin as Ayn is superb, as I
expected her to be; Eric Stoltz as Nathan and Julie Delpy as Barbara are
very, very good indeed; and the total knockout is Peter Fonda as Frank. One
very rarely sees a performance such as his. He doesn’t act Frank; he is
Frank.  He has me in tears almost every time he's on camera, and Helen
often does too.

<p>
Even the smaller parts were wonderfully portrayed.  Tom McCamus, who
portrays Robert Berole, is a major Canadian actor; I had seen him as King
Arthur in Camelot, last summer at Stratford.  I was very touched when he
wrote in my book: "Thank you for letting me be your boyfriend for a while."

<p>
One day, several young people, on the set for the first time, came up to me
to introduce themselves. ‘We’re the Collective,’ one of them said
earnestly. I tried not to burst out laughing, but I couldn’t help it.

<p>
My one disappointment is the character of ‘Caroline.’  She’s the young
woman, played by a fine young actress named Sybil Temchen, with whom
Nathaniel falls in love.  She is not at all like Patrecia in her
personality, her psychology, or her character; she’s an amalgam of several
characters.

<p>
Al Waxman, an actor who has been in American films for years, played Jack
Warner -- a small part in which he has an argument with Ayn about the movie
of The Fountainhead.  He told me, "There’s three places I could be right
now: In Switzerland with my wife; having the hip surgery I badly need; or
being part of this film and playing a ridiculously small role -- but
head-to-head with Helen Mirren.’  Later, I saw him limping and asked if the
pain was bad.  He said, "It hurts until the director says 'Action,' and it
hurts after he says 'Cut.'  In between? What hip?"

<p>
In the beginning of one scene, Julie Delpy is finishing a lecture on
‘Efficient Thinking.’  Her lines had little or nothing to do with the
subject, and I was asked to re-write them.  When the shooting of the new
scene was finished, Julie came running over to me, saying: "Barbara! It’s
wonderful! How do I get the tapes?"  You may be sure she will receive the
tapes.

<p>
Julie is truly beautiful, a rare mixture of delicacy and strength.  Months
ago, when the producers and I were discussing casting, they asked whom I’d
like to portray me.  I said, "I don’t know most of today’s young actresses,
so I can’t choose -- so long as she’s breathtakingly beautiful!" I got my
wish.

<p>
Peter just won a Golden Globe award; on February 10 the Oscar nominees will
be announced, and it's likely that Peter will be among them -- which means
the press will descend. U.S. News &amp; World Report has been here,
interviewing the stars and moi, and the New York Times is expected. It
looks as if there will be a lot of publicity, both by Showtime and in the
press. 

<p>
The other day, I rounded a corner on the way to the set -- and almost fell
over. On a busy corner was a very large billboard with a picture of Peter
as Frank and the words: "This is John Galt! Find out who he is in Ayn
Rand's Atlas Shrugged!" I lost all sense of what decade I was living in.

<p>
The director and the stars -- particularly Julie -- very often ask me
questions about the psychology and thinking of the characters. This is
delightful. I have to tell you of one event that you may have trouble
getting into your head; God knows I had trouble. At the wedding of Barbara
and Nathan, a woman stands behind them, with tears in her eyes; after the
ceremony, Barbara turns to smile lovingly at the woman, who is her mother.
She also is me. I am my own mother at my own wedding!!! I loved every
minute of it. Mary Lou Gutscher, my wonderful hostess who has accepted,
without a whimper, this woman who came to dinner, rushed out to get me a
T-shirt that reads: A Star is Born! In future, I expect to be treated
accordingly. 

<p>
After the shoot one day, Mary Lou and I walked into a nearby grocery store
to get a couple of things. Something seemed strange; the store looked oddly
out of place. And then we discovered we were trying to buy fruit in a prop.
<br>
(I must confess that on my first day on the set, I ate a prop.)<br>

<p>
This can give you only a vague sense of how truly wonderful those five
weeks were for me. When I first arrived, Helen told me that both cast and
crew were terrified at what I might think and say and do -- but after one
day, I was involved in a love affair with all of them. Helen is as
remarkable a woman as she is an actor; I can't imagine a better
performance, and I can't imagine feeling greater admiration and affection
for a performer. She told me from the beginning, about Ayn: "I will not let
her down. I will not let her be diminished."  She read my book, watched
interview tapes of Ayn, read a lot of her work, and came away convinced
that Ayn was a great woman, great in intellect and in passion. She kept her
word: Ayn is not diminished.

<p>
I had all the cast and the members of the crew whom I really got to know
sign my book about Ayn. Helen wrote that this was one of the best acting
experiences of her career. She had told me that her father had been a
communist, that she had been raised to be a communist, and that she'd only
begun to question it fifteen or twenty years ago. So I don't know how she
-- or Peter or Eric or Julie or most of the crew -- view Ayn's ideas. What
was so special was that it doesn’t matter. All of them, and most
particularly Helen, approached their work with an astonishing integrity.

<p>
In one of the final scenes, Helen-Ayn was to give her last talk before her
death, and to be terribly aged, weary, and ill. I entered the set and saw
Helen from the back at first -- and what I was seeing, from the back and
before the shooting of the scene began, was an aged, weary, and ill woman.
You can imagine what she projected when I saw her from the front.

<p>
I normally watched the shooting from the monitor of the director,
Christopher Menaul, wearing a headset. We had to get into odd places at
times. One day -- one late night, to be exact -­ Chris and I and about ten
of the crew were squashed into a bathroom, which happened to be the logical
place from which to shoot the scene. The brief scene was of Helen looking
into a mirror, not saying a word, but speaking paragraphs with her eyes and
expression. When the director called "Cut!" there was a sharp intake of
breath in the bathroom and everywhere on the set: No one had breathed
during the entire scene.

<p>
People in the crew, who were as remarkable as the cast, kept telling me
what a joy it was for them to work on such "a quality film." I was as
fascinated by what goes on behind the camera as in front of it. Within a
few days I was convinced that making a film is so complicated that it can't
possibly be done, never was done, and never would be done. Only they did
it. And it truly is all smoke and mirrors -- and lights. One day we were on
a set, a beautiful house in Toronto that had the feel of Ayn’s home in
Tarzana. Outside, it was a dreary winter Toronto day; inside, the house was
flooded with California sunshine.

<p>
What most fascinated me about the crew is the extent to which each one of
them has to be a self-generator. There were about 40 of them, and their
jobs were much too complex for anyone to be truly in charge; each one of
them had to know his job exactly, and do it perfectly. I got to know many
of them. They have remarkable lives, traveling to shoots all over the
world; and they all seem madly in love with their work.

<p>
It was amazing, during those five weeks, to find myself gradually feeling
as if I were part of a close family -- cast and crew. We were together
often sixteen hours a day or more, we ate together, we talked together, we
all were involved in the same deeply meaningful project and we all had the
same goal; and I realized again something I had known before: the kind of
closeness and caring that is possible when people share a common value and
a common goal.

<p>
When the shoot was over, especially when Helen and Peter left, I felt
utterly bereft. When I got home, one of the producers called and asked if I
was suffering, as she was, from post-filming depression. Definitely. It's
somewhat like finishing a book: One lives so intensely during the writing
of it that when the work is finished all the world seems, for a while, flat
and stale.

<p>
The first few days I was on the set, even though the filming was not in
sequence, it vividly brought back my past, and I had the sense that I was
reliving those days. As a result, I had tears in my eyes -- at minimum ­- a
good deal of the time. The tears were not for Nathaniel or for me, but for
Ayn and Frank. I kept feeling as if I must stop from happening to them what
I knew was going to happen. But by the second week, it stopped being so
intensely personal, and I enjoyed the wonder of seeing my book brought to
life. I realized that a book is about something, but it's not the thing
itself; a film is the reality.

<p>
This was not a once in a lifetime experience. It was a never in a lifetime
experience. This is not the sort of thing that happens. And I feel so
blessed that it happened to me.

<p>
I could happily go on forever, there's so much to tell about those
astonishing weeks. The director and the producers had me write a lot of
dialogue both before I came to Toronto (I arrived here the second day of
the shoot) and especially after. What they wanted from me mostly was
philosophical dialogue pertaining to Objectivism, which, understandably,
neither they nor the scriptwriter could quite handle. 

<p>
So I happily wrote dialogue, and got ideas into the script that I had badly
wanted to get in -- such as: No man has the right to initiate the use of
force. (Interesting to me was the fact that I had no writer's block, not
even for one second; I often was asked, at two or three a.m., to produce
something by the next day -- and I did it with no trouble whatever. It
seems as if I'm not blocked when I can't afford to be.)

<p>
But there was one scene I was unhappy about and which I couldn't get
changed, despite the fact that from the beginning so many of my suggestions
had been accepted. That was the scene where Ayn slaps Nathan. Her words in
this scene were weak, not psychologically true. I kept saying that they
should go to my book for the dialogue, because that was so much stronger
than what they had.

<p>
A couple of days before that scene was to be shot, Helen came up to me with
a sheet of paper on which she had rewritten her dialogue for that scene.
She said it was terribly weak as it was -- that it made Ayn petty, which
she never would have been, that she should be shown as an erupting volcano
­- and that she had gone to my book for the words she would say. She chose
almost exactly the lines I would have chosen -- and she had the clout to
get them accepted by the director.

<p>
The president of Showtime came to the set, presumably because, as the
producers told me, he was very excited about the daily rushes he'd been
seeing. As the shoot progressed, all the people involved seemed to get more
and more of a feeling that they had something quite remarkable on their
hands. In the middle of the shoot, Showtime added half a million dollars to
what they had initially agreed to spend. I know that's loose change to you
and me, but it was important to Showtime.

<p>
This has been an incredible experience for me in more ways than the above.
For many years I have had, to say the least, a jaundiced view of the people
who work in Hollywood.  I earned that view through painful experience with
Hollywood producers.  So I assumed that the producers of PASSION would run
true to form.  I was totally mistaken.  Normally, the writer of the
original material is considered to be the person of least consquence
involved in the film.  But from the very beginning, Linda Wexelblatt and
Peter Crane, the on- line producers, sent me every draft of the script and
asked for my comments and suggestions, many of which were incorporated.
Except when they clearly knew better than I. I grew very fond of Linda and
Peter, but still I waited for the "Hollywood types" to appear.  I'm still
waiting.

<p>
I was so delighted when Marilyn Lewis, one of the executive producers, came
to the set.  She's the woman who took an option on Passion seven or eight
years ago, and fought like a tiger ever since to have it produced either as
a feature film or a television movie.  She and I spent considerable time
hugging each other and gloating.

<p>
It is remarkable that, where once the name "Ayn Rand" got doors slammed in
one's face, it now opens doors.  A major newspaper--that probably should be
nameless -- sent a reporter to the set.  She told me that her editor was a
fan of Ayn, which was why she had been given the assignment to cover the
shoot. It is a newspaper that has been out for blood with Ayn from the
moment she first picked up an American pen.  

<p>
It appears that we are becoming respectiable -- even mainstream!  I, for
one, will have to learn how to adjust to that, after years of being an
intellectual pariah.  Well, a lot of people worked very hard and very long
to reach this day.  But one doesn't always get what one has earned.  This
time, the fruits of our labors are everywhere to seen.

<p>
I feel enormously happy about what I saw in Toronto -- although I haven't
yet seen the first cut.  But Chris Menaul, who is anything but a fan of Ayn
philosophically, is a brilliant director, and I have little doubt that the
film will be very fine indeed.

<p>
I also feel very solemn about what I saw in Toronto.  One day, standing at
Chris' monitor and listening to Helen deliver lines from Galt's speech, I
realized, with no modesty whatever, that I had done for Ayn what no one
else was able to do.  I had written as honest and accurate a biography as I
knew how, and now, because of my work, the reality of Ayn's life would be
on national television in this country, and in movie theaters in Europe.
The real Ayn -- the woman who was so magnificent in her person and her
life, yet so tragically flawed, the woman who suffered so bitterly and
unjustly, yet was so seminal a genius in her philosophical thinking.  And I
thought: "I have kept my promises.  I have paid my debts."

<p>
There will be a premier of the film in Los Angeles before it is shown on
television. I certainly plan to be there.

<p>
Love,

<p>
Barbara
