Agreed.  But just as with other observations of self-scaling phenomena, 
it is important to note how many order of magnitude it has been observed
over.  There was a recent critique of this in Science, I think, saying 
the vast majority of such observations had hardly even looked at one 
order of magnitude.

<p>
<a name="2635qlink1">Granting that there is some variation in the rate at which environments 
change, the question is: how much variation is that?  If it is just one 
order of magnitude on average, then yes the puntuated equilibrium hypothesis
is correct in some some sense, but the "small changes dominate" evolution 
view is also correct.  It's just that "small" varies by an order</a> of magnitude,
<a name="2635qlink2">sometimes tiny and sometimes very tiny.  If environment rate changes vary
by ten orders of magnitude, on the other hand, then maybe it's a new world.</a> 

<p>
<a name="2635qlink3">I'd have to go look up those QTL data papers to see how many orders of 
magnitude their data varies over.   But I'm not optimistic - Orr brags that
one of the data sets covers 82 traits, which isn't even enough to see a 
half an order of magnitude.</a>
