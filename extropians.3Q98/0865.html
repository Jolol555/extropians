<p>
I finally understand what you are saying.  The binary information
perceived by the two persons are the same.  They stay synchronized and
identical because their experiences are symmetrical and identical.  You
</a>
don't care that they are pointing to different walls because their
visual views and binary record of the different walls would look
identical to them.  Both can perceive that they are not pointing toward
the same wall, but they both perceive their wall in the same way, and
perceive the other wall as being a different wall in the same way.

<p>
It is really a clever example to keep the two identical copies
synchronized and seeing the same thing.<a name="0874qlink1">  I think we agree that if they
pushed through the walls to the outside world, they would diverge?</a>  Or
<a name="0874qlink2">if a sound was heard through the walls from one side, they would
<a name="0874qlink3">diverge?</a>  Of if a person tried to interact with them, they would
</a>
diverge?  Only by keeping them locked in the perfect room would you call
them the same person because they were identical?

<p>
For the sake of argument, I will concede that you are right and
everything being symmetrical would keep the copies synchronized.  As
long as they see the same thing and cannot distinguish anything
different, they will not diverge.

<p>
However, back to the upload example,<a name="0874qlink4"> I think that such a room would be
impossible to build in the real world.</a>  The fibers in the carpet would
have to be exact so it would wear the same way.  The walls would have to
be internally identical so that they would dent the same way.  The table
must be purely homogenous so that if broken, it would break perfectly
symmetrically.  Their clothes would have to be so identical that they
wrinkled in the exact same way.  Air currents in the room would have to
be exactly symmetrical so their hair would become mussed in the exact
same way.  A piece of glass would have to be so perfectly symmetrical,
that it would shatter in a symmetrical pattern when broken.  The table
legs would have to be so symmetrical, that if broken off and spun like a
top, they could not fall in any random direction, but would have to stay
standing perfectly balanced in the middle of the room forever.
