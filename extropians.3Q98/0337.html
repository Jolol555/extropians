<a href="0324.html#0337qlink2">&gt;&gt; I will agree with this.  There is no way to tell</a><br>

<p>
<a name="0406qlink2">And the reverse, that two separate things
can really be the same thing (not just two
instances of a class, but identical), seems 
extremely odd, to me. :-(
<br>
Here's another slant on the same area:
<br>
If you loan me a CD, and I take it to my 
house and copy it, do you now own two
<br>
CDs?  I would say not, but perhaps you
<br>
(and anyone who supports intellectual
<br>
property) would say yes?  I am confused
<br>
as to how your position on IP can agree
<br>
with mine (as I have seen that it does)
<br>
and yet the most basic concept involved
<br>
causes a disagreement... Hm.</a>
