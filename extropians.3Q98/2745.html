<a name="2752qlink1"><a href="2730.html#2745qlink1">&gt; dennis, is it possible to add this as an experiment to your website?  spike</a><br>

<p>
Thought you'd never ask! Why yes Spike, the idea of an ongoing medical survey
is one I had considered myself and I have already begun some preliminary work.
I'm just trying to figure out the best way to implement such a site on a long
</a>
<a name="2752qlink2">term basis. By the way far more men develop breast cancer than you might
</a>
imagine. Their prognosis is usually poor because, like you, they assume that
only women can get breast cancer. By the time they seek treatment the cancer
<a name="2752qlink3">has metastastic lesions everywhere. Also many other beverages besides coffee
are implicated in renal stones--soft drinks and tea to name two. I live in the
</a>
Southeast where the incidence of stones climbs along with the temperature each
year probably due to the increase in iced tea consumption ( usually peaks out
in mid-July) and in informal surveys that I have done on my unfortunate
patients they confirm a fondness for glass after glass of the stuff.
