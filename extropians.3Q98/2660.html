thanks ian!  a well thought out reply.  this topic usually generates
a fog of privacy-cautious reactions.  i have been struggling with
this for several weeks, since i posed the challenge of how
to use the web to improve our ability to conduct surveys.  how
can it be arranged so that each extropian can submit only one
survey, thus reducing the possibility of disinformation inserted
by interest parties, while simultaneously allowing perfect protection
of privacy of individuals?

<a name="2661qlink1">controlled laboratory research has its shortcomings, which is
why we still have recalls on new cars.  also, i cannot access
the information discovered by ford from their research track.
but i can see potential problems by going to a ford owners
chat group.</a>

<p>
i am looking for a way to make a database to correllate vitamin
e usage with breast cancer for instance, one not influenced by
those who manufacture and sell vitamin e.  spike
