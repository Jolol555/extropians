<a name="0460qlink1">Allright.  I keep seeing these reference to Florida.  I live in Florida,
and I don't see gun violence decreasing.  I fully believe that murders
may have gone down, but gun violence seems to be way up since they
allowed concealed weapons permits.</a>  Anybody got real statistics about
Florida?</a>

Often there are three or four shootings.  Every few weeks a child is
shot accidentally.</a>  I would say a child is shot to death every month.
We have has quite a few child shooting deaths since January.  Armed
robbery is way up.  Local convenience stores no longer allow clerks to
work night shifts alone.<a name="0460qlink4">  Foreign countries warn their travellers about
Florida's gun laws,</a> and our chambers of commerce are trying to combat
our negative gun image.  Alos, every few months some old retiree
baracades themselves in their house and starts shooting at passers-by.
This has already happened maybe four or five times this year.  It seems
that in the retirement capital of the U.S., people are retiring with
their guns.  Many of them start to go senile, and then they use their
guns.  This is not a rare occurance.  I also have seen a mass shooting
almost every year since the concealed permits are allowed.  Before that,
<a name="0460qlink5">I don't ever recall someone going into a McDonald's and starting
shooting at strangers.</a>  Now we have it all the time, in Post Offices, in
Malls, and lately in schools.  You've heard the recent problems with
kids and guns.  Our local schools say that they confiscate guns every
day from kids who bring them to class.  Hospital emergency rooms handle
shootings every night.<a name="0460qlink6">  So-called "road-rage" is up, where people get
mad about traffic problems and shoot other drivers.  There are lots of
new phenomenon concerning guns that have just become common since the
new gun laws.</a>

<p>
<a name="0460qlink7">Sorry to ramble.  It may be that the "murder" rate is down, but
shootings have definitely gone up.  I live here, and that's my
perspective.</a>  I would love to see real statistics about guns in Florida.
All the statistics I have seen posted here involved "murders" or
"deaths".  I am more interested in how much crime or violence has
increased or decreased.  Most shootings are not "murders" or even
"attempted murders."
