<a href="0680.html#0693qlink1">&gt; When I was tackling the issue of uploading for myself, I had a lot of</a><br>
<i>&gt; difficulty with the question of what does it mean for me to survive. </i><br>
<i>&gt; As a result I developed a thought experiment to try to resolve some of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the issues.</i><br>

<p>
Great thought experiment!  But I do not think anybody would object to
this procedure.  It is a red herring.  The objectionable procedure of
uploading involves taking a brain that is capable of conscious thought
and growth and destroying it.  Your example doesn't do that.  The
objectionable procedure takes a whole body and makes it cease to
function all at once.  Your example doesn't do that.  The objectionable
procedures requires the copy be made first, and then the total number of
living viable copies be reduced by one.  Your example doesn't do that.
Nothing in your example appears to be murder.

<p>
You haven't explained why the murderous-appearing part of uploading is
not really murder.  You created an example that lacks this facet, and
then declare that the problem isn't there.  In your example, you still
are the one-and-only biological human claiming to be you.  You have not
copies or moved your consciousness to another body.  This is a very
interesting example, but it is not an example of uploading of making
copies of consciousness.   Therefore, the example does not explain or
resolve any of the questions resulted therefrom.  (In my humble
opinion.)
