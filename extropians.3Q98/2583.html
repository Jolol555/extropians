I think we already have that, or at least close. If I type "teh" in
microsoft word it turns to "the" automatically, as well as with several
other words (this is word97). When you run the spellcheck, and it comes to a
mistakenly spelled word, one of the choices you can select is
"auto-correct", so that from then on every time you mis-spell that word it
will correct it immedietly before you can type the next one. It is much
better, for me anyway, that it doesn't automatically learn the corrections
by itself, because there are some words not in the dictionary that I don't
want "corrected". "Extropian" for example would come out "extortion". If you
run the spell check and see all your mis-spellings in a row, it's not so
hard to figure out which ones are frequent enough for you to switch to
auto-correct.
