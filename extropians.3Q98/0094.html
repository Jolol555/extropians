"Long-Term Food Restriction, Deprenyl, and Nimodipine Treatment on Life
Expectancy and Blood Pressure of Stroke-Prone Rats"

<p>
Abstract:

<p>
   We determined whether food restriction or the drugs nimodipine (Ca2+
antagonist) and deprenyl (a MAO-B inhibitor) prevent the development of
stroke in the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHR-SP). Forty
male SHR-SP rats, in the age of 34 weeks, were exposed to various
treatments. During a period of 27 weeks, survival and blood pressure were
followed. In the control and deprenyl group, the blood pressure values
remianed unchanged; 50% had died after 27 weeks. All rats that were treated
with nimodipine survived. After food restriction, 7/8 rats survived and
showed a lower blood pressure. This study in SHR-SP rats shows the
superiority of nimodipine on survival, and the potential of food
restriction as a stroke-preventing measure.
