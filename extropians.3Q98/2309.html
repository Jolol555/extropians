<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Preface: Frontiers, Frontiersmen, and Hobbits</i><br>
<i>&gt;=================================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ... that restless, nervous energy; that dominant individualism, </i><br>
<i>&gt;  working for good and evil, and withal that buoyancy and exuberance</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that comes from freedom - these are the traits of the frontier... </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  --  Frederick Jackson Turner, </i><br>
<i>&gt;       Address to the American Historical Society, 1893</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The people are going to miss the frontier more than words </i><br>
<i>&gt;  can express. For four centuries they heard its call, listened to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  its promises, and bet their lives and fortunes on its outcome. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  It calls no more....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  --  Walter Prescott Webb, "The Great Frontier," 1952</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;There are people who, like Tolkien's Hobbits, prefer to stay at </i><br>
<i>&gt;home in their comfortable burrows; and then there are the other</i><br>
<i>&gt;sort:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;When asked why he climbed Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary said, </i><br>
<i>&gt;gnomically, or perhaps just in frustration: because it's THERE! </i><br>
<i>&gt;Which either makes no sense at all, or all the sense in the world, </i><br>
<i>&gt;depending on which sort you are.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;NASA and the The $20,000 Commute</i><br>
<i>&gt;===========================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let's imagine that you had to commute to work using NASA </i><br>
<i>&gt;technology: You would set out on your 20-minute trip with a </i><br>
<i>&gt;briefcase, no-spill coffee cup, and a 3000-lb automobile. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your car comprises 2500 lbs of gasoline and 500 lbs of struc-</i><br>
<i>&gt;ture, plus 180 lbs of payload (you). As you accelerate up the </i><br>
<i>&gt;interstate you burn 200 lbs of fuel per minute. At the 5-minute</i><br>
<i>&gt;and 10-minute marks you shed big chunks of automobile </i><br>
<i>&gt;(empty fuel tanks and booster engines) which you can watch </i><br>
<i>&gt;bouncing and clattering behind you in the rear-view mirror. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;When you reach your destination, there's nothing left but you, </i><br>
<i>&gt;coffee-cup and briefcase chugging into your parking slot on a </i><br>
<i>&gt;pair of motorized roller-skates. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another successful insertion into commuter-space. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tomorrow you pay for a new car, less a ten-cents-on the-</i><br>
<i>&gt;dollar credit from the wrecker who salvaged the discarded </i><br>
<i>&gt;bits of yesterday's vehicle.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If we applied this technology to airline travel, a 737 would carry </i><br>
<i>&gt;five passenges from New York to Chicago. After which the </i><br>
<i>&gt;airplane would go back to the Boeing plant in Seattle to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;torn down and re-built. If everything goes smoothly, the airline</i><br>
<i>&gt;could expect to launch it twice per year.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We don't use NASA technology to drive to work or fly to Chicago </i><br>
<i>&gt;because no one could afford it. Our daily commute would run </i><br>
<i>&gt;about $20,000, and your ticket to Chicago would be maybe only</i><br>
<i>&gt;four or five million dollars, if you fly coach and bring your own lunch.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Scientists vs Blacksmiths</i><br>
<i>&gt;===================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We aren't (trust us) rocket scientists, but we know that current</i><br>
<i>&gt;methods make it horribly expensive to lift stuff out of the earth's</i><br>
<i>&gt;gravity well. If we hope to go spacefaring  before we're all too old</i><br>
<i>&gt;to care, then someone is going to have to do some serious work</i><br>
<i>&gt;on driving down costs. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We can't do anthing about the laws of physics, and fundamental </i><br>
<i>&gt;breakthroughs in technology can't be ordered up just because we </i><br>
<i>&gt;want them. But that doesn't mean that nothing can be done. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The simplest and most obvious thing is to get NASA out of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;space transportation business.  Private investors won't risk their</i><br>
<i>&gt;money in a fledgling spaceflight market so long as NASA keeps</i><br>
<i>&gt;a finger in everything, and is always prepared to plant a whole foot</i><br>
<i>&gt;to protect its bureaucratic flank.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;At this late date in history, it shouldn't be necessary to point out </i><br>
<i>&gt;that government operations never, ever, reduce the cost of doing </i><br>
<i>&gt;anything. The price of first-class mail will continue to go up year</i><br>
<i>&gt;after year and decade after decade, so long as the U.S .govern-</i><br>
<i>&gt;ment has a monopoly on its carriage, even as the general cost</i><br>
<i>&gt;of transportation and data processing falls. If anyone wants to </i><br>
<i>&gt;make a wager to the contrary, we would be glad to hear from you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Economic reasoning and ordinary experience tell us that the only</i><br>
<i>&gt;reliable way to build something cheaper is to let profit-seeking </i><br>
<i>&gt;businesses compete in a free market. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In _Bionomics_, Michael Rothschild explains how scientists like</i><br>
<i>&gt;Papin and Savery demonstrated primitive steam engines to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Royal Society of Britain around 1700. But these learned men</i><br>
<i>&gt;made nothing of it. The steam engine for them was a philosophical</i><br>
<i>&gt;toy. The Alexandrian genius Hero built a little rotary steam-engine</i><br>
<i>&gt;two thousand years ago, and it too came to nothing in the hands</i><br>
<i>&gt;of gentleman-amateurs unconcerned with creating wealth. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It was a small-town blacksmith named Newcomen, and the tinkerers</i><br>
<i>&gt;and businessmen who succeeded him -- men who couldn't have </i><br>
<i>&gt;gotten into the Royal Society's front door -- who built the first useful </i><br>
<i>&gt;steam engines and began the industrial revolution in earnest.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A Cold War Baby Faces Life</i><br>
<i>&gt;=====================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In retrospect, the American space program, with all its staggering</i><br>
<i>&gt;achievements, has been a forced-growth enterprise, a premature</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cold War baby that has been kept alive only with with heroic</i><br>
<i>&gt;measures and at fabulous expense. It's a proof-of-concept that has,</i><br>
<i>&gt;in forty years, managed to deliver exactly twelve people to the </i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;surface of another planet. But that was twenty-five years ago. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The lunar voyagers are now old men and, if space travel continues</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be a state monopoly, we may soon find that there is no living </i><br>
<i>&gt;person still among us who has stood on the soil of another world. </i><br>
<i>&gt;They will be as extinct as the veterans of  Gettysburg and San </i><br>
<i>&gt;Juan Hill.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In an alternate history, space travel might have taken longer to </i><br>
<i>&gt;develop, but with more solid foundations. It might have been driven </i><br>
<i>&gt;by the practical and inevitable itch of many "ordinary" people who </i><br>
<i>&gt;had, quite spontaneously, decided that it was time to try their luck </i><br>
<i>&gt;on the next frontier. To make a buck, or raise a family. To make a </i><br>
<i>&gt;new start. To get out of Compton or Jersey or Terra Haute. To find </i><br>
<i>&gt;God. To amaze their friends, or just see if they're good enough. Or </i><br>
<i>&gt;just because it's there.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Instead of a spare-no-expense, military assault on space, there</i><br>
<i>&gt;might have been a proper marriage of need and technology. Instead</i><br>
<i>&gt;we have a government bureau concerned with justifying and pro-</i><br>
<i>&gt;longing its own existence. Its agenda tends to be shaped by </i><br>
<i>&gt;research scientists, each of whom is intensely interested in some</i><br>
<i>&gt;extraterrestrial phenomenon, but most of whom would rather not</i><br>
<i>&gt;surrender a penny of their budget for anything so rude and crude </i><br>
<i>&gt;as hurling mere civilians into space. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;An old fart like John Glenn gets to go, but we can't. Not that we</i><br>
<i>&gt;begrudge him his encore. He may have fallen into a degrading </i><br>
<i>&gt;line of work, but he was a hero once.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Apparently our assigned role on the new frontier is to be the</i><br>
<i>&gt;father of the bride: shut up, write the checks, and pretend to look</i><br>
<i>&gt;interested. While the scientists labor to figure out if there are any</i><br>
<i>&gt;bacteria living on the Jovian moons. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We aren't that patient.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How Charles Lindbergh Made $10,000 the Hard Way</i><br>
<i>&gt;======================================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the 1890s the U.S. War Department and a quasi-government</i><br>
<i>&gt;agency (the Smithsonian Institution) tried to invent the airplane. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;They spent big bucks to fund an establishment scientist </i><br>
<i>&gt;named Samuel Pierpont Langley, PhD, who succeeded, with </i><br>
<i>&gt;great fanfare,  in launching a steam-powered model, but was</i><br>
<i>&gt;unable to scale the contraption up to carry an aeronaut. The </i><br>
<i>&gt;palm went, of course, to a private venture: the two bicycle </i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanics from Dayton -- self-financed and operating in </i><br>
<i>&gt;obscurity, soon to be the Wright Airplane Company.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The airplane was a minor but picturesque military asset in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Great War, then, in the Twenties, a federal subsidy kept the Air </i><br>
<i>&gt;Mail Service going, although crashes were depressingly frequent, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and all too often the pilot, the mail or both were lost. Charles </i><br>
<i>&gt;Augustus Lindbergh, for instance, flying the Chicago - St Louis</i><br>
<i>&gt;route, twice had to parachute from his aircraft to save his life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A quarter-century after its invention, the airplane was still of only</i><br>
<i>&gt;marginal importance as a transportation system, and was not </i><br>
<i>&gt;paying its way except as a carnival attraction. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the late Twenties, two things changed the incentive-structure.. </i><br>
<i>&gt;First, a congressman named Kelly pushed through an act to get</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;the government out of the civil air transportaion business. Not all</i><br>
<i>&gt;the way out, but far enough. President Coolidge signed it, and as</i><br>
<i>&gt;a result we were never saddled with a state airline. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Second, Lindbergh, a college drop-out from Minnesota, talked </i><br>
<i>&gt;some St Louis businessmen into making an unusual investment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's not often emphasized that Lindbergh's epochal New York-</i><br>
<i>&gt;to-Paris flight in May, 1927 was a commercial proposition as</i><br>
<i>&gt;well as a reach for glory. A man named Orteig had put up a </i><br>
<i>&gt;$25,000 prize for the first non-stop trans-Atlantic flight -- serious</i><br>
<i>&gt;money in 1927 dollars.  Lindbergh invested $2,000 of his</i><br>
<i>&gt;own and $13,000  came from his investors. The syndicate </i><br>
<i>&gt;cleared $10,000, net, and Lindbergh himself became the most</i><br>
<i>&gt;famous man of his generation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Orteig's $25,000 bought a publicity barrage that convinced the </i><br>
<i>&gt;world that the airplane might be sufficiently durable and reliable </i><br>
<i>&gt;that a sane person might onsider using it to get somewhere he </i><br>
<i>&gt;wanted to go, and commercial aviation was soon a reality. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The X-Prize: The New Spirit of St Louis</i><br>
<i>&gt;============================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Buzz Aldrin, one of the Lunar Twelve, with Dr. Peter H. Diamandis </i><br>
<i>&gt;and others (including two of Lindbergh's grandsons), established </i><br>
<i>&gt;the X Prize Foundation in St Louis four years ago in the spirit of  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Raymond Orteig. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As a first step they have estaablished a ten million dollar prize </i><br>
<i>&gt;for the first privately-financed venture that can launch a three-</i><br>
<i>&gt;person vehicle to an  altitude of 100 kilometers. This would be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;suborbital hop like Alan Shepherd's first Project Mercury launch.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The key provision is this: the winning contestant would have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;repeat the flight within two weeks. This is the kind of routine</i><br>
<i>&gt;turnaround that NASA has never been able to accomplish. Any</i><br>
<i>&gt;system that can do it would represent a big step toward making</i><br>
<i>&gt;manned spaceflight a paying proposition and help to wean it </i><br>
<i>&gt;from NASA's state monopoly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are more than a dozen officially registered contenders, </i><br>
<i>&gt;with, supposedly,  a bunch more thnking about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Most are hoping that they can leverage the X Prize money into </i><br>
<i>&gt;part of the capital for a commercially-viable business to haul pas-</i><br>
<i>&gt;sengers and/or  freight into low-earth orbit. Market research tells </i><br>
<i>&gt;them there is demand out there that NASA has not begun to tap. </i><br>
<i>&gt;There is a feeling abroad that it may finally be time for REAL </i><br>
<i>&gt;space travel -- the kind that sells tickets to paying travelers and</i><br>
<i>&gt;dividends to investors. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Space "Tourism" -- The Killer App?</i><br>
<i>&gt;===========================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the early 70s the  microcomputer was a toy like the Royal</i><br>
<i>&gt;Society's little steam engines. Then the tinkerers wrote a </i><br>
<i>&gt;simple "speadsheet" program. Visicalc was the first killer</i><br>
<i>&gt;app -- the product that built mass demand and elicited </i><br>
<i>&gt;cheaper, faster, more capable hardware. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It has not escaped NASA's attention that astronautics has</i><br>
<i>&gt;commercial applications. The market for satellite launchers</i><br>
<i>&gt;is large and growing. But it is not the killer app.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In good bureaucratic fashion, NASA did a comprehensive study</i><br>
<i>&gt;of potential space commerce a few years ago, defining and </i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;measuring every market segment it could imagine, from space</i><br>
<i>&gt;manufacturing to orbital package delivery.The (potential) killer </i><br>
<i>&gt;app was identified, and  it was not what most people would have </i><br>
<i>&gt;expected.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The NASA study said:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the sum financial total of man's activities in space to </i><br>
<i>&gt;   date pale by comparison to the potential space tourism</i><br>
<i>&gt;   market. As many of these studies have pointed out, the </i><br>
<i>&gt;   key to financial success (assuming governments are unin-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   terested in a long-term subsidy) lies in significant reduction</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of the cost of operating the transportation elements.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ...a new, state-of-the-art launch system can provide an </i><br>
<i>&gt;   order of magnitude reduction in launch costs and ... a </i><br>
<i>&gt;   reduction of that magnitude will cause the equivalent of a </i><br>
<i>&gt;   space industrial revolution with a substantial increase in </i><br>
<i>&gt;   users and traffic. The group meeting at NASA LaRC con-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   cluded that to become economically viable, a new launch</i><br>
<i>&gt;   system must generate new commercial markets. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tourism is the biggest industry in the world. Almost 6% of</i><br>
<i>&gt;world GNP. Bigger than steel or pharmaceuticals. Bigger than </i><br>
<i>&gt;automobiles, or telecom or the Net. Way bigger. And we're</i><br>
<i>&gt;not just talking about Disneyworld.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Consider: If you want to follow in Sir Edmund's footsteps, a </i><br>
<i>&gt;trip to Everest will cost you $50,000 (that's just for the permit -- </i><br>
<i>&gt;the expedition itself will cost a LOT more). There's a long, long, </i><br>
<i>&gt;waiting list of paying customers.  And If you want to see the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Arctic close-up, the Russians will rent you one of their ice-</i><br>
<i>&gt;breakers at $19,000 per day, per passenger. They're booked </i><br>
<i>&gt;solid as far as the eye can see. Or how about an adventure-</i><br>
<i>&gt;tour of the other pole -- Antarctica for $60,000? There is an </i><br>
<i>&gt;established, rapidly-growing market for for exotic tourism, the </i><br>
<i>&gt;more exotic the better</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For a while, NASA let members of the public use a shuttle flight-</i><br>
<i>&gt;simulater in Colorado, for $1,500 per hour. They couldn't keep </i><br>
<i>&gt;up with the demand. And that's just a simulator. Oh, yeah, we</i><br>
<i>&gt;REALLY want to go..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Space "tourism" has a frivolous connotation. But it is the </i><br>
<i>&gt;window to settlement, commerce and all other human </i><br>
<i>&gt;spacefaring because it will drive the infrastructure and </i><br>
<i>&gt;capitalization of real space travel like nothing else can. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The usual suspects will bitterly complain that it should not </i><br>
<i>&gt;come into existence because it benefits only "the rich." The </i><br>
<i>&gt;safety freaks will be frightened to death, and the Greens will</i><br>
<i>&gt;pout about rocket pollution. Which only proves that it's the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Right Thing To Do. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Free-Enterprise Rocketeers</i><br>
<i>&gt;=======================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We cannot, in this space, dilate on all of the colorful optimists </i><br>
<i>&gt;who are taking a bead on the X -Prize. Some are dead-serious </i><br>
<i>&gt;professionals from the aerospace industry. Others appear to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;dreamers trying to build spaceships in their garages. But in </i><br>
<i>&gt;Part 2 we would like to introduce a few of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The bicycle mechanics trumped Professor Langley, and we </i><br>
<i>&gt;suspect that some of these free-enterprise rocketeers may find</i><br>
<i>&gt;a way to leapfrog the bureaucrats at NASA.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;1.   Walter Prescott Webb (1888 - 1963) was Professor of History</i><br>
<i>&gt;         at the University of Texas and one of the outstanding American</i><br>
<a href="2307.html#2309qlink2">&gt;         and Texan historians of his time. Like his great predecessor,</a><br>
<i>&gt;         F. J. Turner, he wrote about the frontier experience as a key </i><br>
<i>&gt;         feature of American and world history. The American frontier </i><br>
<i>&gt;         "officially" closed (according to the 1890 U.S. Census) in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         1880s, when Webb was born on a ranch in east Texas. The </i><br>
<i>&gt;         program to land men on the moon was in full swing in 1963</i><br>
<i>&gt;         when Webb died in an auto accident at the age of 75.</i><br>

<i>&gt;         Several of Dr Webb's books are still in print, but The Great</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Frontier, alas, is not, about which someone should do some-</i><br>
<i>&gt;         thing. But it's probably not hard to find in library collections.</i><br>

<i>&gt;     designer of the world's first (we kid you not) propane-powered</i><br>
<i>&gt;     rocket engine. Propane and propane accessories may just do</i><br>
<i>&gt;     the trick.</i><br>

<i>&gt;4.  Samuel P. Langley's eclipse by the  Wright  brothers makes</i><br>
<i>&gt;     an irresistable David-and-Goliath story. For the record, however, </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Langley was an able and accomplished scientist (an astronomer</i><br>
<i>&gt;     who did important work on solar radiation). He was not so hot </i><br>
<i>&gt;     as an R&amp;D manager.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     For some Langley lore, including a handsome portrait, see:</i><br>
<i>&gt;             <a href="http://hawaii.cogsci.uiuc.edu/invent/i/Langley/Langley.html">http://hawaii.cogsci.uiuc.edu/invent/i/Langley/Langley.html</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     On December 8, 1903 Langley failed, very publicly, to fly </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Aerodrome No. 6,  from a barge inthe Potomac. He had built</i><br>
<i>&gt;     the machine built with $100,000 of government money.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Nine days later, the Wrights flew on a beach in North </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Carolina, in a machine they  built with $1,000 of their own </i><br>
<i>&gt;     money. The government, which had spent freely on the </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Professor, refused to accept the Wright design when it was </i><br>
<i>&gt;     offered to  them in 1905, even before their patent came through.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Discouraged and humiliated, Langley died of a stroke in 1906.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     As a respected member of the Washington establishment, </i><br>
<i>&gt;     he seems to have gotten his name on more things than the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     upstart Wrights ever did. The Navy's first aircraft carrier was </i><br>
<i>&gt;     USS Langley (Robert Heinlein served aboard her as a junior </i><br>
<i>&gt;     officer  -- see Part 2 of this essay). NASA's Langley Research</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;     Center is one of its major  installations. And the huge new </i><br>
<i>&gt;     IMAX theater at the Air and Space Museum in DC is named </i><br>
<i>&gt;     after the Professor. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;5.. Charles Lindbergh was a Norwegian-American farm boy from</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Minnesota who lived up to Garrison Keillor's cartoon version of</i><br>
<i>&gt;     that breed: he was a taciturn and self-effacing man who hated </i><br>
<i>&gt;     public emotional displays. So it is surprising to learn that he </i><br>
<a href="2307.html#2309qlink3">&gt;     was a remarkably good and sensitive writer. Those who have </a><br>
<i>&gt;     never bothered to read his _We_ , or _The Spirit of St Louis_  </i><br>
<i>&gt;     should do themselves a favor. _We_ is, unfortunately, out of </i><br>
<i>&gt;     print.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     _The Spirit of St Louis_, a book that Lindbergh spent seventeen</i><br>
<i>&gt;     years writing, came back into print in 1996 from Scribners, with </i><br>
<i>&gt;     an introduction by Reeve Lindbergh. An American classic. </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Available for $24.50 from Amazon.com:</i><br>
<i>&gt;           <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684852772/">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684852772/</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;                 qid=904438944/sr=1-44/002-7280872-0567402</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     We should also mention that A. Scott Berg, a good writer who</i><br>
<i>&gt;     has produced award-winning  biographies of such as Maxwell </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Perkins and Samuel Goldwyn, has written a much-anticipated</i><br>
<i>&gt;     new bio of Lindbergh. He has, reportedly, been given unrestricted</i><br>
<i>&gt;     access to all of the Lindbergh papers by Anne Morrow Lindbergh,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     the Eagle's elderly widow. It's probably fine. But read _Spirit_</i><br>
<i>&gt;     first.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>

<i>&gt;6.  The Commercial Space Transportation Study, a report prepared</i><br>

<i>&gt;     It contains all the charts, graphs, price-elasticity estimates copious</i><br>
<i>&gt;     appendices and other consultant-type stuff anyone could ask for. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;     section dealing specifically with space tourism is sec 3.5.6. </i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Two British researchers presented a shorter paper on space tourism</i><br>
<i>&gt;      to a congress of the International Astronautics Association in 1989.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      It came to similar conclusions as to the importance of ST as an </i><br>
<i>&gt;      economic driver. The paper is online at::</i><br>

<i>&gt;      Mr Jim Kingdon is an amateur space policy analyst who </i><br>
<i>&gt;      thinks that some of the NASA CSTS conclusions are too</i><br>
<i>&gt;      conservative. He maintains an up-to-date site looking at </i><br>
<i>&gt;      the prospects for space commerce using the market </i><br>
<i>&gt;      segments established by the NASA study: His site, with </i><br>
