Today I learnt some new words from classical greek. They are "ducation",
"enter" "erospace", "cience", and last but not least "echnology". I learnt
these word forms from the website of ASTEC. I did so only after Robin
Hanson's misattribution to what doug bailey wrote. Initially the typo
seemed to me to have been a hidden move. It may turn out not to be so. I
understand this and offer the following for its spoof value only.

<p>
Thanks.

EARLIER TODAY:

<p>
"The above phrase seems to be from an ancient greek occult system." I
thought to myself.

<p>
Indeed there is even a "College of echnology" on Infoseek. Pardon my
ignorance.

<p>
"But, is this like an 'ethnology'?". Hanson rarely makes deliberate
mistakes and on such a precise subject matter, or so I thought.

<p>
On further inspection the hard "c" [as in ekus; meaning "out of us"] and
the "human: h", "knowledge: no", "study:logy" [as in ec'h`no'logy] could,
at a stretch, turn out to be an occult greek code word for that little
something that you and I don't know anything about. Coded to look like a
typo.

<p>
But in the meantime, I had to find out just what 'echnology' is all about.
Well my guess, from reading the rest of Hanson's reply, was that echnology
is a scholarly plateau of surmising of what may become a new Technology.
[N.B. here the first letter "T" has been added to a the greek root
combinatoric "ec+h+no+logy".]

<p>
Extropy could be, I considered, a first rate 'echnology' [which I took to
be a science in "all likelihood" and will, when proven, become an accepted
technology.]

<p>
Am I making any sense and would anyone like to hear more?

<p>
ciao,
