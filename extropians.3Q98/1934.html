<i>&gt; Wouldn't put it past him.  Not that this is a definitive response, but from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the URL:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.netaxs.com/~trance/cannibal.html">http://www.netaxs.com/~trance/cannibal.html</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "The Easter Islanders' cannibalism was not exclusively a religious rite or</i><br>
<i>&gt; the expression of an urge for revenge: it was also induced by a simple</i><br>
<i>&gt; liking for human flesh that could impel a man to kill for no other reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; than his desire for fresh meat. (Man was the only large mammal whose flesh</i><br>
<i>&gt; was available) Women and children were the principal victims of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; inveterate cannibals. The reprisals that followed such crimes were all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; more violent because an act of cannibalism committed against the member of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; family was a terrible insult to the whole family. As among the ancient</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maoris, those who had taken part in the meal were entitled to show their</i><br>
<i>&gt; teeth to the relatives of the victim and say, 'Your flesh has stuck between</i><br>
<i>&gt; my teeth'. Such remarks were capable of rousing those to whom they were</i><br>
<i>&gt; addressed to a murderous rage not very different from the Maly amok."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So where's the reference for your claim that human meat is revolting?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Scott</i><br>

<p>
Eating someone can apparently cause their relatives to revolt.
