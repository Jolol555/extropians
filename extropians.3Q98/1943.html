It was pointed out to me that I completely misread this sentence when I
stated:

<p>
<a href="1921.html#1943qlink2">&gt;One last note, I'm not so sure about your "inventions are usually made by</a><br>

<i>&gt;this claim?</i><br>

<p>
I can see you are stating that's the "Hollywood" take not your take. My
apologies. That's what I get for trying to work and respond to posts
at the same time!
