Which merely means the paranoid will wear head-mounted displays and write

decryption on hardware attached directly to the brain. In any case, finding
me and sending in a thousand fly-sized cameras to read what I'm typing
is much, much, much harder than scanning my plaintext email for keywords
at some centralised server...</a> and as others have pointed out, we'd also
be able to see exactly what the government is doing, so we'd know that
they were sending these cameras around.

new technological developments and becoming a police state that would
make 1984 look like utopia.
