<a href="1375.html#1381qlink1">&gt;I can´t believe that the "extropians" are discussing things such as</a><br>
<i>&gt;gender and sex and female extropians...Spring time has gone!! :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Does that really matter to the ones whose main purpose is "to</i><br>
<i>&gt;increase intelligence" and so on?????</i><br>

<a href="1375.html#1381qlink2">&gt;By the way, besides man, women and gay do you also want to know</a><br>
<i>&gt;anything else?? Is there any cats among us??? And chickens??? :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think more important to the extropian list is to know for example our</i><br>
<i>&gt;nationality and tastes. If you want to know WHO are the extropians,</i><br>
<i>&gt;there's lots of things (and more important) to know besides gender...</i><br>

Gender and sexual orientation, like nationality are demographic lower level
information.  A more extensive survey of those on this list would be
preferable if any attempt to poll was made at all.  This to include
preferences and attitudes toward a range of topics.  It's difficult to tell
what attitudes predominate because the most vocal among us likely distort
our perception of the group as a whole.  I suspect we are quite diverse, but
I also place little stock in suspicions and try to rely more on data when I
can.

<p>
As for the gender imbalance thread, I most appreciated Robin Hanson's point
regarding a lack of empathy for the plight of so many men.
