<p>
I never quite got this "budget surplus" thing; people keep saying that
the budget is balanced or even has a surplus, yet the national debt 
on 7/7/98[1] was:

<p>
    $5,530,116,137,980.45

<p>
And a year earlier was:

<p>
    $5,355,915,100,573.58

<p>
So in a year the national debt has increased by about $175,000,000,000 
yet there's a balanced budget? Maybe this government math is just too 
hard for me, but I don't think my bank would be too happy if I were to 
claim that I'd earnt as much as I'd spent, yet go $175 billion further 
into debt.

<p>
For the national debt not to increase by the end of the fiscal year,
the government have to find at least $120,000,000,000 from somewhere;
in the same period last year they overspent by around $60,000,000,000.

<p>
Where's the surplus?

<p>
    latest date available as I write.
