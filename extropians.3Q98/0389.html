One effect of an armed populace would be that those who could not 
handle the responsibility and would end up using their gun illegally -
 at which time they would be taken out by others. This is the most 
distressing effect of allowing many people to go armed, but it might 
be less harmful to society at large to have a few killings by 
'hotheads' who are themselves taken care of, sooner or later, by the 
majority, than the present system where the only persons you are 
likely to meet who are armed are criminals or the police..

<p>
As far as 'hothead' goes, I, too, might not have survived to my 
creaky old age had I lived in this kind of society. But then, if I 
had been born even 200 years ago, I would most likely have been a 
street beggar, assuming I had lived that long, due to my terrible 
eyesight...

<p>
I see only two options to control the present crimewave. One is to 
immediately allow all law abiding people who are qualified through 
tests to carry a weapon to do so, while eliminating all consentual 
(drug, sex, and morality) crimes from the books. The other is a 
complete police state with 1984-like surveillance and arrests of 
anyone who even appears to be thinking about violating the law. 
Recent history makes me fearful we are heading toward solution #2.
