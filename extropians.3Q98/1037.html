<p>
Two suggested drafts of answers and a suggested revision of one of Nick's.
I think that this section is particularly important in a FAQ precisely
because it addresses, more than any other section, the fears that people
have with relation to transhumanist ideas.  I recommend an approach that
uses a personable style with a minimum of jargon and an emphasis on how
transhumanists themselves are addressing these issues.  

<p>
<a href="1023.html#1037qlink1">&gt;What kind of society would posthumans live in?</a><br>

<p>
The type of society that posthumans would develop does depend on the type of
posthuman that evolves from present-day humans.  We can speculate as to how
a posthuman might interact with humans, providing that a posthuman would
want to interact with humans at all, but it is difficult to imagine how a
society of posthumans might conduct their lives.  Any construction of a
posthuman society would be based on our experiences and desires as humans,
or as transhumans, and we cannot depend on those experiences or desires
having any relevance to a posthuman.  As the seeds of a posthumanity
develop, some of us hope to have the opportunity to observe their
interactions with humans, transhumans, and other posthumans, from which we
might formulate an idea of what kind of posthuman society would develop.

<p>
<a href="1023.html#1037qlink2">&gt;What happens if these new technologies are used in war? Might they</a><br>
<i>&gt;cause our extinction?</i><br>

<p>
Some transhumanist ideas focus on the development of technology, but the
development of humans themselves also represents an important area within
transhumanist thought.  We think that each human has the ability to choose
positive change, and new technologies can provide the opportunity for many
humans to live with more individual freedom and to break away from
oppressive governments.  If we look at history, from ancient times to the
present, we can see a general trend away from brute force and towards
cooperation between individuals and between societies.  We can also see a
trend of using technologies previously used in war to support peaceful and
educational activities.  The Internet itself originally developed as a part
of the military infrastructure, but now its primary use is to support
research and personal communication in every field of human endeavor.
Although war remains a brutal reality in our world today, more humans have
chosen to support increased economic trade and communication between all
nations.  Transhumanists support the continued use of new technology in ways
that will benefit all humans, not just those who seek to gain power by means
of force.

SUGGESTED REVISION:

<p>
<a href="1023.html#1037qlink3">&gt;Won't new technologies only benefit the rich and powerful? </a><br>
<i>&gt;What happens to the rest?</i><br>

<p>
The typical pattern with new technologies is that they are expensive
in the beginning and become cheaper as time goes by.  In the medical
field, for example, experimental procedures are usually only available to
research subjects and the very rich. As these procedures become routine, the
cost of the procedures decreases, and more people gain access to them.  In
the field of consumer electronics, the price of advanced computers and
calculators drops as more complicated models are designed.    
- It is clear that everybody can benefit greatly from improved 
technology.  In the beginning, perhaps the greatest advantage will go to those 
who have the resources, the knowledge and especially the willingness 
to learn to use new tools.  Each society will still face the decision of how
to address inequalities between its richer and poorer members; in that
respect the situation will be no different from today. Yet, the pie that is
to be divided will be enormously much greater.
<p>
	Transhumanists encourage every society to embrace new technologies, as this
will allow every human to progress beyond their present level.  Many groups
have arisen to address the problem of distributing technology to undeveloped
areas, such as the 'freenet' movement that is working to provide Internet
access to communities that presently cannot afford to install access.  Many
transhumanists work in the field of science policy and support [NICK, I
REWORDED THIS BECAUSE IT CONTAINED THE TRIGGER WORDS 'RESIST' AND 'LEFT
BEHIND'  TRIGGER WORDS ARE THOSE THAT RAISE IRRATIONAL FEARS WITHOUT
ADDRESSING THEM.]

Take care,
