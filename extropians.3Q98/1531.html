What I think you should be saying is that there is an inability to make the
measurements of irrationality because of the secretive person's unwillingness
to be measured.</a> But what they don't realize is that they can be second guessed

This is why when using a tool like my Ingrid system, one finds it hard to rope
people into thinking in grids. Distributed intelligence is harder to kick start
than a mexican wave. But is can happen.
