<i>&gt; I'd be curious to hear why the Egyptians "felt" like they were in their</i><br>
<i>&gt; livers.  Was this really true for the average Egyptian?  In certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; relaxation/meditation exercises, one is instructed to relocate one's</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness to various parts of the body.  I could never do this, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; became acutely aware that I "felt" like "I" existed right behind my eyeballs</i><br>
<i>&gt; and couldn't really move.  Is that because I've always been taught that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; where my brain is and it is the source of my consciousness?  Or is there</i><br>
