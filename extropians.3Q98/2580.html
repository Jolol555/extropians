<a name="2589qlink1">Yes, the Transactional Interpretation which someone else has already

We shouldn't be surprised that QM should be full of oddities when we're
not using the relativistic version, and from the 'common sense' point of 
view you simply can't tell whether the cat is alive or dead until you 
open the box. This interpretation seems to be a mathematical expression 
of that rather obvious point.

<p>
I honestly don't understand why such an important reinterpretation of QM
isn't more widely known.
