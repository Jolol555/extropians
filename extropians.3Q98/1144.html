Abstract
<br>
  Two citrus flavonoids, hesperetin and naringenin, found in oranges and
  grapefruit, respectively, and four noncitrus flavonoids, baicalein, galangin,
  genistein, and quercetin, were tested singly and in one-to-one combinations
  for their effects on proliferation and growth of a human breast carcinoma
  cell line, MDA-MB-435. The concentration at which cell proliferation was
  inhibited by 50% (IC50), based on incorporation of [3H]thymidine, varied from
  5.9 to 140 micrograms/ml for the single flavonoids, with the most potent
  being baicalein. IC50 values for the one-to-one combinations ranged from 4.7
  micrograms/ml (quercetin + hesperetin, quercetin + naringenin) to 22.5
  micrograms/ml (naringenin + hesperetin). All the flavonoids showed low
  cytotoxicity (&gt; 500 micrograms/ml for 50% cell death). Naringenin is present
  in grapefruit mainly as its glycosylated form, naringin.
  These compounds, as well as grapefruit and orange juice concentrates, were
  tested for their ability to inhibit development of mammary tumors induced by
  7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Two
  experiments were conducted in which groups of 21 rats were fed a semipurified
  diet containing 5% corn oil and were given a 5-mg dose of DMBA
  intragastrically at approximately 50 days of age while in diestrus. One week
  later, individual groups were given double-strength grapefruit juice or
  orange juice or fed naringin or naringenin at levels
  comparable to that provided by the grapefruit juice; in the second
  experiment, the rats were fed a semipurified diet containing 20% corn oil at
  that time. As expected, rats fed the high-fat diet developed more tumors than
  rats fed the low-fat diet, but in both experiments tumor development was
  delayed in the groups given orange juice or fed the
  naringin-supplemented diet compared with the other three
  groups. Although tumor incidence and tumor burden (grams of tumor/rat) were
  somewhat variable in the different groups, rats given orange juice had a
  smaller tumor burden than controls, although they grew better than any of the
  other groups. These experiments provide evidence of anticancer properties of
  orange juice and indicate that citrus flavonoids are effective inhibitors of
  human breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro, especially when paired with
  quercetin, which is widely distributed in other foods.
