Are you aware of how crystal structures grow and produce more crystals?
I don't know if this is an example of what you're asking for, but it is
a great example of how simple structures can grow and reproduce very
quickly, with the "more organized" structures being more likely to form
than the "disorganized" structures.

<p>
Imagine little microscopic cubes of salt bouncing around in a solution.
They are randomly sticking together and breaking apart.  They are not
too sticky, such that they are permanently glued together, but they are
not to unsticky that they always bounce apart.

<p>
Sometimes the cubes randomly touch perfectly aligned such that an entire
square side is right against another square side.  When they stick like
this, they form a larger crystal that perfectly lined up.  This perfect
alignment is much rarer than the random alignments, but sometimes it
happens.

<p>
More often, the cubes randomly touch in an imperfect alignment such that
only part of a square side is touching the other cube.  Some will
randomly stick half-on and half-off another cube.  In this case, the
surface area that is stuck together is half that of the perfectly
aligned cubes above.  Their sticking power is half that of the cubes
above.

<p>
The more perfectly aligned a cube is when it sticks, the more of its
square side is stuck to the other cube.  The more surface area that is
stuck, the more likely it is to stay together.  The better-aligned cubes
are much more likely to stick together than the poorly-aligned cubes.
By randomly bouncing around, cubes are more likely to line up in rows
and columns, forming larger cubes, than they are to stick randomly and
form noncubic structures.  Like magnets aligning themselves up when
stuck together, these cubic crystals will line up and construct larger
crystal cubes just by chance.  These cubes grow longer and larger, until
the large structures can't hold their own weight, and pieces break off
to start new cubic structures.

<p>
This happens relatively fast.  This is not the slow random chance that
the crystals will happen to fall together in a big block.  This is the
fast self-assembling nature of sticky cubes.  They naturally fall into
self-arranged patterns of organization just like coins naturally fall on
one side, but rarely on their edge, because they are much more likely to
do so.

<p>
This example has cubic structures being formed by cubes that are sticky
on all six sides.  For molecules that are not cubic, but say hexagon,
with stickiness around the edge but not the top or bottom, they will
tend to stick together in a plane, forming membranes rather than lumps.
DNA and RNA are string-like structures, only sticky on the very ends.
It is easy for molecules to add on the end and grow the strings, but
breaking apart the middle is much less likely to occur.

<p>
Contrary to popular belief, random chance with molecules is not like
shaking a box of cards and having them fall together in a card-house
structure.  It is more like shaking a box of magnet cubes, and having
them stick together.
