<p>
No slack needed.  You made very good comments.  Thanks.
I have clarified my question, partially in light of your good comments.

<p>
<a name="0523qlink1">Guns are tools, and tools are useful.  But "usefullness" is not enough to be
extropian.  Are guns merely useful tools, or are they somehow extropian?  Are
they transending tools of transhumans, or are they ordinary tools of humans?
Are they futuristic intelligent technology, or are they old-style technology
from the past?</a>

<p>
It was late last night (early this morning actually) when I first posted this
question.  Now that I am thinking more clearly, let me try to answer my own
question in an obvious and direct way.  We have the extropian principals which
define extropy.  I believe that life-extension, smart AI, and the like serve
these principals and are therefore extropian.  A hammer does not serve these
principals, although it may be a useful tool to an extropian doing some
extropians things.

<p>
<a name="0515qlink1">So lets look at guns in light of the extropian principals</a> and see how they
<a name="0515qlink2">serve them.  Since I may be biased, not being a gun owner,</a> I would like to hear
<a name="0515qlink3">from gun advocates to see how they rate guns as extropian.


<OL>
  <li>  Do guns promote Boundless Expansion?</a>
        seek more intelligence, wisdom, effectiveness?
        increase lifespan?
        remove limits to selfactualization and self-realization?
        overcome constraints on progress and possibilities?
        expand into the universe advancing without end?


</OL>
<pre>
        My answer, no.  Guns only limit or terminate someone's ability for
<a name="0515qlink4">        Boundless Expansion.  I think guns are only useful where</a> one has
<a name="0515qlink5">        decided that it is not possible for one's own future</a> goals to co-exist
<a name="0515qlink6">        with anothers, so that the other's plans for the future</a> must be
<a name="0515qlink7">        thwarted.  The gun is the tool used to stop the other from
        achievingd their future goals.  This seems anti-extropian by
        definition.  Only by using this unextropian tool against an
        unextropian person, does this indirectly promote</a> extropian goals
<a name="0515qlink8">        by destroying competeing unextropian goals.  This does</a> not directly
<a name="0515qlink9">        push extropians forward, but pushes</a> the nonextropians farther back.

2.  Do guns promote Self-Transformation?
        affirm continual moral, intellectual, and physical self-improvement?
        work through reason and critical thinking, personal responsibility?
        seek biological and neurological augmentation?

<a name="0515qlink10">        My answer, no.  Guns are not a tool for self-growth.</a>  This is not
        applicable to guns.

3.  Do guns promote Dynamic Optimism?
        fuel dynamic action with positive expectations?
        adopt a rational action-based optimism?
        shun blind faith and stagnant pessimism?

<a name="0515qlink11">        My answer, no.  Guns are required for the worst-case</a> or bad-case
<a name="0515qlink12">        scenario.  It implies that coexistance is not possible,</a> peaceful
<a name="0515qlink13">        resolution is not possible, and that threat of death</a> or actual death
<a name="0515qlink14">        will be required in future situations.  This may</a> be an accurate
<a name="0515qlink15">        assessment of the future, but it is not</a> a positive expectation or
<a name="0515qlink16">        an optimistic one.</a>

<a name="0515qlink17">4.  Do guns promote Intelligent Technology?</a>
        Apply science and technology creatively to transcend "natural" limits?

        My answer, no.  Guns are low-technology.  Low-technology may be the
<a name="0515qlink18">        best answer in certain cases, but it is not high technology,
        intelligent technology, or extropian technology.  Again,</a> this does not
<a name="0515qlink19">        mean that guns aren't the right answer, but that they</a> are not the I.T.
        answer.

5.  Do guns promote Spontaneous Order
        support decentralized, voluntaristic social coordination processes?
        foster tolerance?
        diversity?
        long-term thinking?
        personal responsibility?
        individual liberty?

<a name="0515qlink20">        My answer, no... but I'm not totally sure about this one.
        Guns can support decentralized social coordination</a> and individual
<a name="0515qlink21">        liberty.  I wouldn't call the use of guns</a> a voluntaristic process.
<a name="0515qlink22">        Guns are a coersive process to force someone</a> to cooperate who does not
<a name="0515qlink23">        wish to do so.  Tolerance requires acceptance, while</a> guns are used
<a name="0515qlink24">        where other options are not acceptable.  I don't think</a> guns work with
<a name="0515qlink25">        long-term thinking.  Guns seem more of an immediate</a> reaction with no
<a name="0515qlink26">        chance for long-term consideration after they are used.</a>  I do see
<a name="0515qlink27">        where protecting one's own individual liberty could</a> use guns.  But
<a name="0515qlink28">        I don't see the guns fostering the liberty, but more</a> of countering
<a name="0515qlink29">        those who conflict with one's liberty.</a>

</pre>
<p>
<a name="0523qlink2"><a name="0515qlink30"><a name="0507qlink1">The bottom line:  I think guns are low-tech, old-style tools.</a>  They are not
<a name="0515qlink31">futuristic, intelligent technology.  Guns destroy someone else's</a> future options
</a>
<a name="0515qlink32"><a name="0507qlink2">to limit their potential.  (Hopefully because that person's</a> future plans are
<a name="0515qlink33">deemed to be "bad".)  They do not create options or expand</a> future options.
<a name="0515qlink34">Guns are only useful in negative situations that are not</a> progressing in an
<a name="0515qlink35">extropian-desireable manner.</a></a>

</a>
<p>
<a name="0515qlink36">Instead of pushing us "Onward and Upward", guns push our</a> competition "Backward
<a name="0515qlink37">and Downward".  In a competitive race this makes us seem</a> farther ahead by
<a name="0515qlink38">comparison, but it doesn't move us any closer to the finish line.</a>  If there has
<a name="0515qlink39">to be a choice between "us" and "them", most people would</a> choose "us".  But I
<a name="0515qlink40">would hope that future technology will develop effective tools</a> to protect "us"
<a name="0515qlink41">without having to destroy "them" in return.  That would</a> be an extropian tool.
