<a name="1240qlink1">The roton rotor blades are also used for launching as well.</a> The rocket engines

are supposed to be on the tips of the rotors, and the centrifugal forces
generated by the rocket propelled spin helps to feed the fuel to the motors, thus
eliminating the weight of fuel pumps and reducing the mechanical complexity of
the system (the highest maintenance parts of the space shuttle are the fuel
pumps). There is also an efficiency gain here. Since the chemical reaction of the
fuel propells the  rotor around (gradually rotating to full forward propulsion
beyond the atmosphere, kind of like how the V-22 Osprey rotates its wingtip
motors) and the rotor is using the reaction mass in the atmosphere, you gain a
bit of efficiency here.<a name="1370qlink2"> In propulsion, it is always more efficient to move a lot
of mass a little, rather than a little mass</a> a lot  (those who think that
ion/plasma type drives are efficient are only right in that they are MASS
efficient, but definitely not energy efficient). Because of this setup, the roton
can fire up its rotor-tip engines when it lands in order to maneuver around if it
needs to for alternate landing sites, to counteract crosswinds, etc., which gives
it a bit more maneuverability than a normal autogyro.
