<a name="1323qlink1">I think some of you guys need to get out more and meet some more
intelligent women.  I'm married to a perfectly attractive woman who at
least likes the idea of transhumanism even if she doesn't consider
herself a transhumanist.  I find the idea that attractiveness or being
a female precludes certain beliefs (transhumanism, extropianism,
etc..) to be insulting.

<p>
Lots of people find our ideas to be strange or wacky.  If it wasn't
for the evidence that something big technologically was about to
happen, I'd find it strange and wacky too.  

<p>
I have too many male friends who are stuck on finding the perfect
woman who is intelligent and beautiful and likes all the stuff they do
<br>
(football, stereos, cars, etc...).  There's plenty of women out there<br>
who will make excellent mates for the next couple hundred years or so.
 Just open your eyes.  Learn to compromise.

<p>
Besides, when we become posthuman, what will physical beauty matter
anyways?

<p>
Just my $0.02 worth.</a>
