I think you're a little confused, this wall pointing table moving example was  
yours not mine. Personally I never cared for it much.

orientation you decided to put the two copies into when you made them in the 
round duplicating chamber, or at least the angular orientation of their sense
organs. Trying to derive identity from angular orientation will not get you 
any further than you previous attempt to do it with linear orientation, 
position is just a non starter.

<p>
I'm a neutral, I am a member of neither the pro nor the anti mark on wall  
faction, I just pointed out the consequences of both. 

<p>
I fear this is starting to degenerate into a heated argument over room design 
and interior decorating,  to try to prevent<a name="0847qlink3"> that let me concede for the 
fourth or fifth time that if the  copies receive different information from 
their senses, for whatever reason, then there would indeed be two people not
