New Zealand, to the best of my knowledge, was settled by white
people, as well as having a fairly numerous native population. It
was a destination for transportation.

Australia was settled, originally, by convicts, yes, but that
ended a very long time ago (although it is useful for ignorant
foreigners to trot out on occasion as some sort of point-scoring
token), and more than 50% of the current Australian population
was born overseas. Stereotypes are occasionally useful, but they
need to be correct to be so.
