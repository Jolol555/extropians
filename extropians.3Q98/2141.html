The above sort of data fusion has no central authority. This type of
leveraging of the infosphere is already seen as an inevitable omnisensorial
military command. The military realize by 2025 there can no longer be any
centralized response. What, I say, needs to happen is for the population to
structure their response via a global neural net so that it too will be
absorbed and noticed by the military as the people's conscience thus
neutralizing the military; - not dissipated and pissed up against the wall
as currently happens to our collective electronic voice.

<p>
Over time I think such a system can be very quick to react with something
like an instinctive response when something out of the blue occurs but
otherwise the neural nets will stabilize not become a demarchy.
