Two poems by EON (one of my pen names) can be found at a charming 
little scifi magazine called Antipodean Science Fiction at 
<a href="http://www.nor.com.au/users/antisf/stordex.htm">http://www.nor.com.au/users/antisf/stordex.htm</a>.  

<p>
One of the poems, 'The Waterborne', was inspired by 
a thread that took place last year on the &gt;H list.  Also included are 
links to transhumanist resources and to  Natasha's art page, which 
contains more of my work.

<p>
Enjoy.

<p>
BTW:  I'm signing off for an extended break, so please don't take 
offense if you write to me and I don't reply soon.
