<a href="2252.html#2517qlink1">&gt; Well fellow thinkers, I think I'll follow Mr. Pablo's lead and make my</a><br>
<i>&gt; first comment. Greetings all round.....</i><br>

<p>
:-)
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2252.html#2517qlink2">&gt; About your dynamic music idea........</a><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think you could expect much success from this little</i><br>
<i>&gt; venture.....not that the idea isn't novel or original, but due to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; source of our enjoyment of music. How many times have you witnessed</i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody say during a song : "Here comes the good/best bit....", I bet</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite a few, or noticed a song "grow on you", whereas you may not have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been moved by it from the outset. The rush of anticipation before the</i><br>
<i>&gt; chorus kicks in and the band go mad, or that shiver down the spine when</i><br>
<i>&gt; you get to the uplifting bit, represent a significant factor in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; person's musical enjoyment, and require listening more than once. </i><br>
<i>&gt; A piece of music that is different every time you hear it would lack</i><br>
<i>&gt; these vital attributes, removing "singing along", "the good bit" and</i><br>
<i>&gt; "growing on you" in one fell swoop.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What do you think ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
I thing this project will no expect to generate the most beautiful sound for
the user in a determinated moment, but why not? it could be a great investigation
area (personal music, using subjetive information, but it's closer to the
interactive music area) I don't know if people could buy music like that, but
for example.... hear Mike Olfield's last albun, there is two songs very closed
(Serets and Source of Secrets), they only changes in few movements, but 
you can feel it very diferent.... you can generate infinite variations of the
same kind of song, the fact is that you can generate it with a program, or
the music can selfvariates. The procedural information in the music may
study what's the best to do for a user and a moment given...

<p>
I think another path to investigate could be darwinian or envolving music,
that will be closer over time to a situation given or expected.....

<p>
I hope you catch my idea well!! :-)
