<p>
&lt;sigh&gt;  You're bringing up topics before you're explaining them; your use
of metaphor isn't helping me here.

<p>
Are you referring to the secret society "Skull &amp; Bones" of which former
president George Bush was a member?  How does Skull &amp; Bones "slay a
perceived dragon," as you put it, and how does that result in information
loss?  What does the activity of Skull &amp; Bones and/or the loss of certain
information have to do with AI?  I presume that it relates to m-w in that
the loss of information represents an irreversible process.  Moreover,
beyond the fact that S&amp;B has an agenda, what does any of THAT have to do
with accounting?

<p>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink29">&gt;  So a "superior" form of neural network (unsupervised, presumably?) would be</a><br>
<i>&gt;  coordinated by/with/through AI?  I take it you're presuming that AI will</i><br>

<i>&gt;  the net themselves).  Am I close so far?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A reserved "Yes" to the above, except that needs and wants are necessarily</i><br>
undertaken
<br>
<i>&gt;as different processes.</i><br>

<p>
This sentance is very unclear.  Do you mean that [needs] and [wants] are
undertaken as different processes from each other?  Or do you mean that
<a name="2070qlink10">[needs and wants] are undertaken as different processes than something else
which you have only intimated?

<p>
And for that matter, how are needs and wants "undertaken" in the first place?

<p>
<a name="2070qlink11"><a href="2036.html#2057qlink30">&gt;The present economic drivers may/will still be active but there</a><br>

<p>
Economic drivers?  You mean things that drive the economy, like needs and
wants?  Or something different?  And what other sorts of "drivers" might
appear?  What do you mean by forms of abstraction and delving into bionomic
(do you really mean ecological?) and personal areas?  How do you report a
bionomic area?  What WILL be the motivation for doing so?

<p>
<a name="2070qlink12"><a href="2036.html#2057qlink34">&gt;Don't forget that no land area on earth is presently exempt from the</a><br>

<p>
As a point of interest, this is a terrible abuse of the term
"totalitarian."  Most totalitarians throughout history have, in fact, been
socialists.  I suggest you stick to the tried and true term "tyrannical,"
if you insist on calling it a system of domination.  But at any rate...

<a href="2036.html#2057qlink36">&gt;Like I said before the world's rulers are on</a><br>

<p>
Erm, in general, this is why I tend to oppose those who want to get rid of
money: they want to impose a leader to dictate economic activity instead.
It seems unlikely that any of these rulers will forget about that, since
eliminating money is really extrinsic to their goal of total world domination.

<i>&gt;  &gt;accounting community.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I have no clear idea at all what this sentence means.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Relativity/clustering techniques?  Are you referring to the way in which</i><br>
<i>&gt;  income equality is measured?  There's a lot of different people and ways of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  thinking that call themselves "connectionist."  What do YOU mean here?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, I'm referring to the way in which clusters of information need to</i><br>
maintain a set of
<br>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink42">&gt;measurements applicable to type and where the same measurements can be</a><br>
used in
<br>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink43">&gt;other classifications. For example, at certain levels of abstraction the</a><br>
numbers 1 trough 5
<br>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink44">&gt;could be used to represent the qualitative value of everything providing</a><br>
the element
<br>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink45">&gt;being measured was in the correct context. In another example, a needs</a><br>
analysis would
<br>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink46">&gt;register the appropriate amount of information to cause an action. I don't</a><br>
foresee
<br>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink47">&gt;the need to restrict the use of these numerical abstractions because of a</a><br>
scarcity
<br>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink48">&gt;of bits and there won't need to have an income of bits allotted as each</a><br>
<i>&gt;abstraction will not subtract from a pool like money does in capitalism. Each</i><br>
<i>&gt;abstraction will be a reflection amongst larger and larger circulations.</i><br>
Anyway,
<br>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink49">&gt;this is my view of a positive sum economy or what I now term a neuronomy.</a><br>
Get it?

<p>
No, not at all.  I haven't the foggiest idea what you're referring to in
this paragraph.

<p>
<a name="2070qlink13">Here, lets try a thought experiment.  Suppose you've got a two person
economy, Alice and Bob.  Alice has an apple which she happens to value less
than Bob values the apple.

<p>
Now, in capitalism, Bob will pay Alice for the apple, thus maximizing value
and resulting in economic efficiency in the Marshallian sense.  This
process is scalable to all kinds of economic activity.

<p>
Now, suppose Alice and Bob had chosen to reject capitalism and instead
operate under a neuronomy.  What would happen?  What would they do?  How
would it work?

</a>
<p>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink50">&gt;Also, there is a common acceptance of what represents old connectionism</a><br>
and new
<br>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink51">&gt;connectionism. I understand basically that perceptrons were of the old</a><br>
kind and
<br>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink52">&gt;PCA / radial basis functions are of the newer. What is being looked for is</a><br>
less
<br>
<a href="2036.html#2057qlink53">&gt;layers and more inferencing.</a><br>
