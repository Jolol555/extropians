Hello:

<p>
<a name="0005qlink1">What became of the "former" extropians list.  All that seems to be "in the
mill" is
<br>
chat between a few members about various personal subjects.</a>

<p>
<a name="0005qlink2">My original interest in the "exptropians" was the technical / scientific
postings, 
<br>
as in events, recently published papers, and items of interest in regards to
the "original" aspects of extropian related developments.

<p>
Is this now no longer the case???</a>

<p>
<a name="0005qlink3">I have no interest whatever in chit-chat and personal debates . . .
but I do very much respect the original thematic trajectory of what the
extropian organisation had as an agenda.

<p>
Has this changed?
</a>
<p>
Please advise accordingly.

<p>
most sincerely
<br>
Charles Ostman
