  IAN: I'd call those who respond to nonpersonal
  dispassionate analytical input with naught but
  personal attacks and mud slinging "unstable,"
  and a few others things too, but I think one 
  cannot instill a respect for free inquiry in 
  those dead-set on preventing it, even by holding
  a mirror up to their shameful acts of aggression.

<p>
  Consider the above response. It purports that 
  I should not be abused since it gets me upset
  (framing my opposition to abuse as a sign of 
  mental instability), and yet the statement is 
  inherently intended to do exactly that which
  it says should not be done, and is therefore
  expossed as a willful effort to inflict what 
  the author predicts will cause personal hurt, 
  any sign of which on my part will then be used 
  to frame me as "unstable." All-in-all, it is 
  a violate aggression against free inquiry. 

<p>
<a name="2700qlink1">  I can't figure why a list of a group that I 
  think stands for the highest ideals, for free
  and anti-dogmatic inquiry, consistently expresses
  the lowest varieties of anti-inquiry gangsterism.
  But the reason that such reactions are displayed
  by any subset of people is always the same: to 
  prevent with noise the signal of inquiry that 
  is perceived as a potential threat to existing 
  memetic codes... hence the "logic of abuse."</a>

<p>
  No doubt, as in the past, my objections here to 
  personal abuse will result in more of the same,
  all the while the initial nonpersonal, logical 
  issues I raised are buried under a mountain of 
  noise, which is obviously exactly the intention.

<p>
  I get the message: Go away and stop threatening 
  our memes with foreign-devil ideas and other 
  things that frighten us. It's pathetic!
