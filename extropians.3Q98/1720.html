No sir, Mr. 87 you are not slated to die, you are slated to commit
voluntary amnesia.  It is my pleasure to inform you that after that is
complete you Mr.87 are going on a wonderful vacation.  Actually, for
this to be perfectly true the original plan would have to be slightly
changed where Mr. original stays in stasis while the 10 hours of work
is being completed. 

<p>

<a href="1716.html#1720qlink2">&gt; Original made the assignments and I note he didn't say he and 99</a><br>

<p>
No, Mr .87 you in fact did make the assignments yourself.  I can't
believe you don't remember.

<p>
Yes, that WAS you.  And no, you do not know what it is like to face
the prospect of immediate death you only know what it is like to face
the prospect of voluntary 10 hour amnesia.

<a href="1716.html#1720qlink4">&gt; &gt; Why would you ignore your own intentions.</a><br>

<i>&gt; It doesn't really matter why, </i><br>

<p>
It doesn't really matter why?  Another inconsistency in style.  Is
John Clark in trouble, do you have him tied and gaged?  Come on Harvey
this isn't funny.  If I just give up and agree with you will you let
him go? ;)

All right, I give up, your right I'm wrong now let him go!

If I had 1000 copies playing blackjack in Vegas they would all be
nearly identical yet some of them would be acting in radically
different ways.

<a href="1716.html#1720qlink7">&gt; &gt;You've just completed 10 hours of mundane work at the office today in</a><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;flash light type device that can induce a perfect 10 hour amnesia</i><br>
<i>&gt; with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;no side effects whatsoever.  You are 100% convinced this is safe and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;effective.  He offers you $10,000 to let him use the device on you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As you say it's a judgment call but I'd tell him no way.</i><br>

<p>
Okay, then<a name="1952qlink9"> how about if he said he found out that your wealth had been
divided by 1000 because of some unfortunate events in the U.S. economy
today.  And that your family and friends will welcome your
interactions with them 1000 times less.  This includes your friends on
the Extropian and Transhuman lists.  And then he continued to list
many more unfortunate things that happened to you today.  Then he
says, "but I can fix it all if you just let me use</a> the device on you".
<a name="1952qlink10"> Would you do it if all this was true?</a>

<a href="1716.html#1720qlink8">&gt; &gt;P.S.  Has anyone on this list verified the signature on the message</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;where John Clark changed his public key?  After more than three years</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of reading his post with mostly just minor disagreements, all of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sudden, one week after changing his public key this major</i><br>
<i>&gt; disagreement</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;about the fundamentals of identity pops up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nobody can claim absolute consistency so perhaps something I said in</i><br>

<i>&gt; don't know what it could be but I'd love to find out, please</i><br>
<i>&gt; illuminate me.</i><br>

<p>
Its not so much a contradiction in something you previously said.  Its
more where I perceive you to reside on the local memetic maxima bump
here at the top of the extropian fitness mountain peak.  At least your
still here on the tallest mountain in the world looking down at the
vast fitness deserts surrounding us.  Maybe the valley between our
fitness bumps is just experiencing tektonic plate shifting and I'm not
use to earthquakes.
