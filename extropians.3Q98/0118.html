 Thanks for the clarification of what you meant. Its obvious that the image that
Kiwis get of the US is a result of TV like Miami Vice, etc.as well as the LA
riots, and our general metropolitan new programs, that they most probably see as a
result of a)being stuck in airports in the US, b) seeing TV in their own country
which may have anti-US agendas of some sort, c) most foreign visitors to the US
never go very far from the cities. Keep in mind that most metropolitan areas have
the most restrictive gun laws, while the rural areas have very loose gun laws.

<p>
<a name="0229qlink1">Guess what? gun ownership here in the US is a minority as well, especially in the
cities where crime is highest. Out here in the rural areas, like where I live, gun
ownership is higher, and we have much lower crime rates, even lower than most
other countries. Where the crime in the US is is in the cities, where the most
restrictive gun laws are...interesting coincidence, eh?</a>
