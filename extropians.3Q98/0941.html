The great strength biology has over present day electronics is in the
ability
<br>
of one neuron to make thousands of connections of various strengths with

<p>
other neurons. However, I see absolutely nothing in the fundamental laws
of
<br>
physics that prevents nano machines from doing the same thing, or better
and
<br>
MUCH faster.

But what about this sort of stuff? ( The Penrose- Hameroff quantum

Here's an example of the list about it

your[Orch OR] model needs to have many tubulins
coherently entangled so that ORCH OR can collapse the state in an act of

<p>
consciousness. Now in your model you SAY that this happens but you don't

<p>
actually calculate realistically how this will be achieved.

<p>
Stuart
<br>
We calculate that, for example, 2 x 10^10 tubulins in superposition for
25 msec will self-collapse. We calculate this from the indeterminacy
principle
<br>
E=h/T where E is the gravitational self-energy of the superpositioned
(separated from itself) mass, h is Plancks constant over 2pi, and T is
the
<br>
time till collapse. It happens because superposition, in the Penrose
view,
<br>
actually involves separations in underlying reality - spacetime geometry
at
<br>
the
<br>
Planck scale. The separations are unstable and after a while reduce,
something like a radioactive particle decays.

<p>
NICK: this number 2 x 10^10 is the number of coherent tubulins that YOU
NEED in order for ORCH OR to collapse the wavefunction. You cannot use
this
<br>
calculation to show that a coherent state of 2x10^10 bits MUST EXIST.

<p>
In a more familiar context your logic resembles a real estate broker
calculating that you need $40,000 to close a deal (collapse the wave)
and
<br>
you go home and tell your wife that the broker has given you $40,000.


<p>
Stuart
<br>
As I said earlier 2 x 10^10 entangled tubulins for 25 milliseconds
lifetime.
<br>
Im not sure what type of calculations you want, but Id very much like
to know.

<p>
NICK: What kind of calculation? That's up to you. Perhaps something like
a
<br>
2D array of interacting spins on an Ising lattice as is done for
ferromagnetism calculations with parameters adjusted to match tubulin
parameters. From this post i already see another big problem with
setting
<br>
up such a model. I had naively assumed your two tubulin states open (O)
and
<br>
closed (X) to have the same energy so that when you perform a
phase-coherent superposition of |O&gt; and |X&gt; you get a nice stationary
state
<br>
(no time dependence). But in your model |O&gt; and |X&gt; differ in energy by
as
<br>
much as one electron volt. This means that the superposition is not
stationary and will oscillate between the two states at a frequency of
about 10^15 HZ (f = deltaE/h). Because this frequency is so high it will
be
<br>
extremely difficult to maintain phase coherence with an adjacent tubulin

<p>
oscillating at the same (or slightly different) rate, let alone a whole
gang of 'em. A better strategy might be to superpose all the |O&gt; states
and
<br>
all the |X&gt; states separately to make two interpenetrating coherent
states
<br>
but as i say only a quantitative toy model calculation can show if
coherent
<br>
tubulin states can plausibly exist at all. Knowing the extreme
difficulty
<br>
of creating coherent states in the laboratory under the best of
conditions
<br>
i am pessimistic about the possibility of establishing coherence in a
hot
<br>
wet tubulin array.

<p>
Your (very imaginative) model rises or falls on the crucial question of
whether this particular kind of coherent state exists in the brain or
not.
<br>
My informed guess is that coherent states of even one or two tubulins
cannot exist for more than a nano-second or less. Seems to me that until

<p>
someone shows (quantitatively) that the existence of large coherent
tubulin
<br>
states is even remotely plausible that your whole proposal is physically

<p>
UNREALISTIC at a very basic level.

<p>
And of course if you can't cohere any more than one or two tubulins in a

<p>
single neuron the operation of gap junctions is wholly irrelevant.

<p>

Phillip Benjamin has said that Bohm's hidden variable X is
the "mind" in the post-quantum backaction theory. That is
not the way I see it. The mind is the post-quantum potential
landscape Q* whose shape, at time t in the configuration
space for the material path X(t), depends directly on that
path. Recall that the shape of the path itself depends on
the shape of the landscape. Therefore, both the shape of the
mental Q* landscape and the material path X(t) depend
directly on each other, as well as the Darwinian
environment. This is in contrast to the ordinary one-way
quantum mechanics where the quantum potential Q landscape
has no direct dependence on the X(t) it guides. Q only
depends on the Darwinian environment with no spontaneous
self-organization. Therefore, the Bohm quantum Q field is
not formally an adaptive neural net like the new
post-quantum Q* field is. That this violation of Wigner's
action-reaction principle is essential to maintain
uncontrollable quantum randomness and Shimony's
"passion-at-a-distance" is proved by Bohm and Hiley in The
Undivided Universe.

<p>
My position is that Bohm has a realistic nonlocal theory
that has peaceful coexistence with relativity i.e.,
Shimony's "passion-at-a-distance"). That is one-way Q -&gt; X
Bohmian non-mechanics. All of that is in the book The
Undivided Universe. But this is strictly for inanimate
levels of organization of matter-geometry. There is no
sentient living mind at that one-way level. As soon as you
have sentience (inner feels, "The Spirit" of Saint Paul if
you like) you have two-way post-quantum non-mechanics Q*(X)
<br>
<i>&lt;-&gt; X.</i><br>

<p>
The two-way feedback-control loopof spontaneous sentient
self-organization is free-will and perception unified.
Controllable superluminal signals are a fundamental property
of this sentient level. Mind is impossible without
controllable superluminal signals. That is why
remote-viewing really works (e.g. Jim Schnabel's Remote
Viewers). That is why Shamans can do what they do. You
cannot have any of that without controllable superluminal
signals that violate quantum randomness and relativistic
causality. You cannot have the creation this sentence, this
non-random c-bit string from the q*-bit string that is my
conscious awareness of my writing this sentence as I am
writing it, without violating these sacred cows of modern
physics.  This very message is the public record of a
post-quantum selfaware-measurement of my Q* field by my Q*
field. The Q*(X) &lt;-&gt; X is John Archibald Wheeler's sentient
"self-excited circuit". This is my post-quantum theory.


<p>
[Moderator's note - Gordon Globus]
<br>
 "The two-way feedback-control loop of spontaneous sentient
self-organization is free-will and perception unified." Your
physics is very impressive, but how you get out sentience,
perception and free-will needs some explaining. These
are very deep issues that you treat en passant.

<p>
[Jack]
<br>
My main
<br>
reason for the above post at issue here is to respond to P.
Benjamin who says "mind" is Bohm's hidden variable X in the
backaction theory that I am proposing. That is not so. X is
the matter-geometry "brain" configuration, the "mind" is the
post-Bohmian potential field that forms a landscape that X
moves on. This landscape is similar to those in complex
adaptive systems theory and in neural net theory (e.g.
Stuart Kauffman At Home in the Universe and Murray
Gell-Mann, The Quark and the Jaguar).

Many people have noticed the analogy of the quantum
wavefunction with thought starting with Bohr. I am saying it
is more than an analogy. This is like when Feynman said that
