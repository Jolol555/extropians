<p>
<a name="0495qlink1">Yeah...reality sucks.

<p>
<a name="0498qlink1">The fact of the matter to the best of my understanding is that you either have
to be well enough armed yourself to deter agression  ....or pay someone to do
that little chore for you.  Other wise the social predators run amok amongst
us.</a>

<p>
<a name="0495qlink2">And I agree with what you said. (including that which I didn't copy)...but I
don't see any solution with present day implemented technology.  Particulary
</a>
when govenment is falling down on its job...and the social mores that
prevailed in the fifties (check out the violence stats for that time frame...)
have changed so much.

<p>
AND I don't see any easy way to return to those days.  A society is an
ecology.  There are certain "progenitor species" that prepare it and then go
away.  The progenitors that prepaired society for its instantiation of the
fifties era are no where to be seen...and similar ones are
(hopefully....&lt;great depression...infant mortality....other great
hardships&gt;....not on the horizon)...

<p>
</a><a name="0495qlink3">So what to do?  My guess is that it's up to you.

</a>
<p>
Scientists, Technicians and Engineers I mean.

<p>
<i>&gt;From the dawn of life it's always been an "arms race"...arms against armor.</i><br>
<a name="2327qlink1">So how about</a> if you techie types come up with better armor and some kind of
non lethal offensive armament that could be as useful as firearms?  Because
it's always GONNA be an arms race...all the wishfulness and happy thinking
isn't gonna change things.

<p>
<a name="0514qlink1">My guess would be (given what little I know of present day tech)</a> that a
<a name="0514qlink2">portable laser might be used to ionize a pathway thru the air</a> such that it
<a name="0514qlink3">might conduct an electric current.  Kind of a "cow prod</a> at a distance"...or a
<a name="0514qlink4">taser without the wires.

<p>
A nonlethal device that no one would be seriously hurt</a> with.  (absent the odd
<a name="0514qlink5">heart attack...but surely less lethal than airborne</a> lead poisoning)...but ever
<a name="0514qlink6">bit as much a deterrant as a firearm.  BETTER than a fire</a> arm perhaps due to
<a name="0514qlink7">it's possible physical characterstics of no recoil...speed</a> of light execution
<a name="0514qlink8">(well...REAL fast anyway...faster than a bullet)...no "lead" nesecarry...low
</a>
<a name="0514qlink9">(or no) noise...etc....etc.. Very little training would be needed.

<p>
Or some other kind of a "stunner".</a>

<p>
<a name="0495qlink4">Absent something similar I see no change is our current situation...until all
the boys grow up that is....the ones who survive.
