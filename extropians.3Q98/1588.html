This is interesting.  (Well, at least to me.)

<p>
Joe Newman is an insane yet brilliant inventor who is currently at my
mother-in-law's house working on his latest magic motor which puts out
more energy than it takes in.  I know that's impossible - that's his
claim though.

<p>
Joe Newman has an interesting past.  I wish I had some links to some
info.  If someone else does though, please post them.  I know that
<a name="1595qlink1">he's an inventor from Mississippi (oxymoron?).  I think he invented
those bar bells that have concrete inside plastic sheaths.  Anyways,</a>
he has been working on these motors for quite some time now.  My
step-father-in-law is a mechanical engineer who tried to debunk him
and became a believer, albeit grudgingly.  Newman has also converted
at least one researcher from MIT who he's currently suing for stealing
his ideas.  Mr Newman is incredibly paranoid.  

<p>
I say that Mr. Newman is insane because he claims that Ronald Reagan
and George Bush are both demonically possessed and he's running for
president on the platform that he'll declare martial law and return
the country to his wacko religious ideal.  

<p>
He does have some interest though in the demonstration he's planning
for next weekend (or the one after that).  He has patents for this
motor in Mexico (ooh!) and some countries in Europe and maybe Japan. 
He has investors coming from China, Germany and several here in the US
to see his demonstration.

<p>
He's going to hook this thing up (it's initially powered by 4 lantern
batteries) to generator (I don't know how) which will power a house
all day long.  It sounds nuts, and I'm sure it is, but it's
interesting and he's at my in-laws house.

<p>
Joe also has a weekly radio show in Phoenix, AZ where he talks about
physics and electronics and his nutso religious stuff.

<p>
If I can find some links to his web site I'll post them, and I'll keep
everyone informed about the demo.  He claims this device will power
your house for 4 years without having to replace the batteries.  I do
know that the motor was running in their garage the other day.

<p>
He's nuts, but he's fun.
