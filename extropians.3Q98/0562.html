In a nation with more laws on the books than every other country in the
world combined (the US), this gets everyone their first strike.

<p>
<a href="0530.html#0562qlink2">&gt;(2) deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or</a><br>
<i>&gt;conning others for personal profit or pleasure.</i><br>

<p>
Use an alias online, or flatter someone with white lies: that's</a> two strikes.

<p>
<a name="0565qlink3"><a href="0530.html#0562qlink3">&gt;(3) impulsivity or failure to plan ahead</a><br>

<p>
Subjective enough to tar anyone: "What, you didn't anticipate being hauled
in for a mental health inspection?  Poor planning--strike three. 

<p>
<a href="0530.html#0562qlink4">&gt;(4) irritability and aggressiveness as indicated by repeated</a> physical fights</a><br>
<i>&gt;or assaults</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0565qlink4">No one gets out of high school without earning this strike (you don't need
to be the one doing the assualting, or starting the fights).

<p>
<a href="0530.html#0562qlink5">&gt;(5) reckless disregard for safety of self or others</a><br>

<p>
Subjective.  To that little-old-lady down the street, anyone who drives
faster than 20 mph meets this description.  Curiously, the opinions of
bureaucrats are often indistinguishable from those of little-old-ladies....

<p>
<a href="0530.html#0562qlink6">&gt;(6) consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure</a> to sustain</a><br>
<a name="0565qlink5"><i>&gt;consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations</i><br>

<p>
Subjective.  Come to work with a hangover a few times in a decade, get a
strike.

<p>
<a href="0530.html#0562qlink7">&gt;(7)  lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent</a> to or rationalizing</a><br>
<a name="0565qlink6"><i>&gt;having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.</i><br>

<p>
Oh damn, I compared bureaucrats to little-old-ladys, in the process hurting
the feelings of all the little-old-ladys who read my words.  And I don't
give a damn....  Still another strike.

<p>
Using this list, the government could brand anyone they pleased with the
APD label, and remand them for mandatory "treatment", if we followed your
proposed solution to violence.  Time to go out and buy a gun (oops, two
more strikes for expressing that sentiment...).
