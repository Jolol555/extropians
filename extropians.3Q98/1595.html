<a href="1588.html#1595qlink1">&gt; he's an inventor from Mississippi (oxymoron?).  I think he invented</a><br>
<i>&gt; those bar bells that have concrete inside plastic sheaths.  Anyways,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe also has a weekly radio show in Phoenix, AZ where he talks about</i><br>
<i>&gt; physics and electronics and his nutso religious stuff.</i><br>

<p>
Damnit! I already dislike this guy... What a coincidence.  The other day I was 
bitching and whining because a piece of plastic had come loose while I was 
"working out" with one of those plastic coated dumbells from the 70's.  It 
popped out and gashed my arm pretty deeply since I didn't notice I was drving 
it into my skin as I lifted the weight...

<p>
Tell him _I_ will sue his ass for fucking up my arm if he doesn't snap himself 
to reality and cut out the quackery.
