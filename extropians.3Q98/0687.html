Abstract
<br>
  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether or not aspirin further potentiates the
  greater post-prandial thermogenesis induced by ephedrine
  with caffeine. DESIGN: Determination of the acute metabolic rate response to
  the following treatments: 1050 kJ liquid meal (M); meal plus
  ephedrine (30 mg) and caffeine (100 mg) (MEC) or meal plus
  ephedrine, caffeine and aspirin (300 mg) (MECA). SUBJECTS:
  Lean, pre-disposed obese and obese women (n = 10 each group). MEASUREMENTS:
  Pre- and post-treatment metabolic rate determinations via indirect
  calorimetry. Post-treatment measurements made at 20 min intervals for a total
  of 160 min. RESULTS: In all groups, metabolic rate increased significantly
  more following the MEC or MECA, compared to the meal only (p &lt; 0.05). The
  obese group had a significantly greater absolute increase in metabolic rate
  following the MECA and MEC compared to both the lean and pre-disposed obese
  groups (p &lt; 0.05). Metabolic rate remained elevated at the end of the 160 min
  following all treatments. CONCLUSION: Aspirin does not further potentiate the
  acute thermic effect of ephedrine and caffeine with a meal.
  However, the full thermogenic response was not measured and longer duration
  studies are necessary to confirm these results.
