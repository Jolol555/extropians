Copyright was introduced to protect the profits of publishers, not
originators, although that justification was later used.  See
"Intellectual Property: A Non-Posnerian Law and Economics Approach"
by Tom G. Palmer in the Hamline Law Review, 1989, pp. 261-304 and
the cover story of the September Atlantic magazine on IP for
discussions of this.

I feel that the property status of information will be the single
greatest non-engineering factor in shaping societies of the next
century.  If we continue down the path of increasing property
protections for information we will likely have a society run by
state/corporate cartels with huge disparities of wealth between
information owners and non-owners and a very boring culture.

<p>
However, I feel that anything qualifying as a "singularity" will
be engineering-driven.  Nanotech implies drastic changes irregardless
of the property regime it occurs in, short of a totalitarian one
that could completely control access to the technology.
