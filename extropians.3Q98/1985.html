I enjoyed the series immensely.  The economics were kind of goofy, but that
shows up in a lot of fiction.  Besides, it's not like humans have *never* had
communitarian economics.  Do you consider it impossible that Martians would
set up a suboptimal economic system?

<p>
P.S.: Red Mars and Green Mars were the best.  The storyline is kind of
meandering
<br>
in Blue Mars; Blue Mars seems mostly just an excuse to talk about ideas on
terraforming Mars and habitable designs for other areas in the solar system.
They are, however, seriously neat concepts.  Red and Green have neat ideas
too,
<br>
and good plots as well.
