<a href="2558.html#2566qlink1">&gt;the gene has nothing to do with eyes.</a><br>


<p>
It has nothing to do with any particular eye or type of eye, it has something
to do with the abstract concept "eye" and that's what gives it so much power.


<p>
<i>&gt;It's not a language in any sense [.] It just turns on a whole bunch of other</i><br>
<i>&gt;genes.</i><br>

<p>
I don't understand why you say "just", it seems like an astonishing
accomplishment to me. It's like saying Shakespeare just arranged letters in a
certain sequence.


<p>
<a href="2558.html#2566qlink2">&gt;These other genes, collectively, make an eye.</a><br>

<p>
One entity tells many other entities to make a very complex object, if that's
not a language its close enough for me.


<p>
<a href="2558.html#2566qlink3">&gt;It's not a code either; if you find a new homeobox gene you</a><br>
<i>&gt;have no way to know what it does except by looking at the organism.</i><br>

<p>
If you knew only one word of a language the only way to learn more would be
to observe how the native speakers react to words. Once you knew a few more
words and learned a little grammar you could start to make simple sentences.
I think the best way to learn the grammar of life as well as increase our
vocabulary would be by observing embryo development.


<p>
<a href="2558.html#2566qlink4">&gt;We could get a lot of mileage by adapting existing organisms/organs,</a><br>
<i>&gt;as opposed to designing new ones</i><br>

<p>
True, and that's just what nature usually does, although the modifications
can sometime be pretty radical. An elephant's tusk is a modified tooth, its
trunk a modified nose, a horse's hoof is a modified toenail, a mammal's teat
is a modified sweat gland and a feather is (probably) a modified scale.
