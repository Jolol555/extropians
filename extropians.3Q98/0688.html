"Average Daily Nutrient Intake and Mood Among Obese Women"
Nutrition Research 18(7): 1103-1112 1998

<p>
Abstract:

<p>
   This study examined the relations between stable moods (i.e., non
clinical levels of anxiety and depression) and average daily intake of
certain macro- and micronutrients, among a sample of obese women. Subjects
were 38 women assessed at entry to a long-term weight-loss medication
trial. Subjects' levels of aanxiety and depression were assessed by
self-report measures and by a psychiatrist's ratings. Average daily intakes
of energy, macronutrients, certain micronutrients, and caffeine were
computer analyzed (Nutritionist III) from subjects' eating diaries. Results
were analyzed via Pearson correlation coefficients and multiple regression
analyses. Higher carbohydrate (CHO) intake, particularly simple CHO intake,
was consistently related to lower levels of both anxiety and depression.
Some relations of mood to caffeine and micronutrients were also observed on
correlational analyses. Discussion examines possible explanations for
findings, particularly the surprisingly strong association between higher
intakes of simple CHO and lower levels of depression and anxiety.

<p>
Additional note by poster:

<p>
    Simple carbohydrate means sugars. No statistically significant relation
existed between complex carbohydrates, with the sugar grams removed and
mood. A slight benefit to higher dietary selenium intake was also detected.
Supplement use was not monitored.
