<p>
 This pretty much defines the shortfall in Dan's
 argument that the two observers measured the other 
 as smaller free from reference to something larger,
 and thus (stated in error) a zero-sum isn't found.


<p>
Every thing, A, is measured by its deviation from zero A.

<pre>
                   zero A = no A

</pre>
<p>
Every measured unit of A is a displacement from 0 A:

<pre>
                   0A---&gt;1A---&gt;2A

</pre>
<p>
The positive displacement of 1 from 0 is symmetrical to 
the negative displacement of 0 from 1, and the measurement
taking place is equally both displacements, one displacement
is not a more valid representation of the measure taking place:

<p>
          0---&gt;1 = (+1) = (1 is 1 more than 0)

<p>
          0&lt;---1 = (-1) = (0 is 1 less than 1)

<p>
The degree to which 1 is larger (+) than 0 is equal and opposite 
to the degree that 0 is smaller (-) than 1. Indeed, the statement 
<br>
"1 is 1 unit more than 0" tells us the same thing as the statement<br>
"0 is 1 unit less than 1."  This  equality  expresses the equality<br>
of the degree to which both of the symmetrical displacements shown 
above between 0 and 1 are valid representations of the measure of 
difference between 1 and 0. We can express the equal validity of 
each side of the 0,1 difference as such, where "v" = "validity":

<p>
    v( 1 is 1 more than 0 )  =  v( 0 is 1 less than 1 )

<p>
Those two equally valid statements are inverse measurements of 
the defined difference, and as such are identical to inverse 
subtractions, which are also measures of difference, thus:

<pre>
       (1 is 1 more (+) than 0)  =  (1 - 0) = +1
       (0 is 1 less (-) than 1)  =  (0 - 1) = -1

</pre>
<p>
Therefore, the difference between 0 and 1 is equally both 1 and 
-1, not 1 more than -1, since both statements are equally valid 
expressions of the measurement of 1 from 0. It clearly follows
therefore that the sum of all valid measurements derived from
the differentiation of 1 from 0 will = 0, since 1 + (-1) = 0.

<p>
 Negative Numbers Are "In" Positive Numbers

<p>
Negative 1 is internally "nested" within positive 1 due to the 
fact that both -1 and 1 are equally and simultaneously valid
expressions of the 0,1 relation that defines 1 as 1. All the
negative numbers are "in" the positive numbers, since each 
positive number is its difference/displacement from 0 and 
that difference is symmetrical (n + (-n)) and sums to 0. 

<p>
Whatever we measure, 1 unit of X is derived by its deviation
from 0 X, or "no X." The displacement from 0 is symmetrical
such that 1X is as much (more)X (+1) as 0X is (less)X (-1) 
and the net displacement (+1 + (-1)) always equals 0.

<pre>
                     0  1  2  3
                    ____________
                 0 | 0  1  2  3 |
                   |            |
                 1 |-1  0  1  2 |
                   |            |
                 2 |-2 -1  0  1 |
                   |            |
                 3 |-3 -2 -1  0 |
                   --------------

</pre>
<p>
Every number has a discrete relation with 0, and every number
IS its difference from 0: 1 is 1 more (+) than 0, 2 is 2 more 
(+) than 0, 3 is 3 more (+) than zero, and so forth... At the 
same time, 0 is 1 less (-) than 1, 2 less (-) than 2, and 3 
less (-) than 3. The relation of n to 0 is simultaneously 
expressed by equal yet opposite values that sum to zero.

<p>
Both of those symmetrical values are valid at the same time 
just as the statement " 0 &lt; 1 " says both "0 is less than 1" 
and "1 is more than 0" at the same time. And the sum of this
<br>
"more-less" difference always = 0, and thus the sum of all<br>
difference must always = 0, as the matrix above proves.

<p>
But moreover: the sum of all valid measurements always = 0 
because the measurement of 1 unit of X is composed of two 
symmetrically different components that sum to 0. So all 
measurement, being founded upon the symmetrical difference
between 0 and 1, can never actually exceed a net sum of zero.

<p>
The conservation of measure is the conservation of difference.
The conservation of difference is the conservation of identity.
