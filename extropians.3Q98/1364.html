The embargoed high biotech island of libertarian SF turns out to be
Cuba.  I find this quite amusing.
<br>

<p>
Summary: SmithKline has partnered with Cuba to market their group B
meningococcal vaccine, and has applied for an embargo waiver in the US.
(The vaccine fights group B meningitis.)  One team is in the first phase
of human clinical trials of an AIDS vaccine they hope will be ready for
commercial use in 2 years.  Another group is "perfecting" a cholera
vaccine.  Biotech is now Cuba's 4th largest export earner.  US market
analysts confirm Cuba has state-of-the-art research and production
capability.

   In recent years, the government has invested hundreds of millions of
dollars in biotech facilities and research. That has created something of a
technology gap here: scientists using advanced genetic techniques to clone
fish in a land where the U.S. embargo has made antibiotics scarce on hospital
shelves and smoke-belching, '50s-vintage Chevys and Buicks commonplace on the
streets. 
<p>
     Dr. Mario Pablo Estrada, who heads the fish-transgenesis project,
explains the phenomenon with simple mathematics: "With $7 million, we couldn't
even begin to produce our own basic medicines," which he said are far more
costly to mass produce than highly specialized "niche" products such as
vaccines.  "But with a $7-million investment here at the genetic research
center, we can make $30 million in sales, and we can use that to buy a lot of
basic medicines."
