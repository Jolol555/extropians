Just as a short copy program can copy all of Windows NT, it may be possible
to perform an upload from a frozen brain without understanding the details
of its operation. All that's required is a functional copy of the brain's
essential structure, ie, neurons, synapses, hormones, etc. Making this copy
is much simpler than understanding the structure's functioning, deciphering
it or interpreting it.

<a href="2453.html#2549qlink2">&gt;Now, suppose that I am cryogenically frozen and brought back in the</a><br>
<i>&gt;future.  They may have scanned my entire mind and recreated my thought</i><br>

<i>&gt;not recorded, stored and recreated?  They are gone and lost forever.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
As a cryonicist this is a fact I must face - spiritually very similar to
the issues brought up by the idea of reincarnation. Cryo can be seen as a
techno form of reincarnation.

<p>
<a href="2453.html#2549qlink3">&gt;But, I have memories of them.  What they looked like, how they acted,</a><br>
<i>&gt;what they said, how they lived.  What if all the known data about a</i><br>
<i>&gt;family member is also read out of my mind, and used to recreate that</i><br>
<i>&gt;family member?  It wouldn't be a true representation, but it would be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;recreation of my perception of them.  If the recreation looked the same,</i><br>
<i>&gt;spoke the same, acted the same, generated the same kinds of reactions</i><br>
<i>&gt;and conversations, I probably couldn't tell the difference.  As far as I</i><br>
<i>&gt;would know, that person would have been recreated.</i><br>

<p>
Extracting these memories is a *difficult* problem. I think at best you
would end up with a simulation which like an actor, looks, talks, but
essentially isn't the person simulated. You might be convinced it is the
same, but the catch here is that any person I know has a *vast* amount of
information they use in their response to me, and this information is NOT
visible or accessible via my memories, as it resides in THEIR brain, not mine!
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2453.html#2549qlink4">&gt;To carry the idea further, what if they gather information about this</a><br>
<i>&gt;person from many different people? &lt;snip&gt; It might even be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;synthesize data together and come up with conclusions about itself that</i><br>
<i>&gt;nobody else knew, because none of us had the complete picture.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Interesting, yes. Complete, never.

<p>
<a href="2453.html#2549qlink5">&gt;Any comments about this method of recreating people?  It wouldn't meet</a><br>
<i>&gt;my definition of survival.  But it might be interesting to create a new</i><br>
<i>&gt;person to replace a lost person.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Over the years there have been a number of science fiction stories on the
theme of recreating historical persons and the results of same...I can't
recall specific stories though, I guess my doppelganger forgot them....
