Dan responded:

<a href="0825.html#0896qlink3">&gt;I can in fact think of a reasonable way to calculate the temperature of</a><br>

<a name="0915qlink1">Similarly, Eugene L. said:

<p>
And in response to my queries for clarification, wrote:

<a href="0852.html#0896qlink5">&gt;... (Btw, would you let me have a copy of your algorithm</a><br>

<a name="0908qlink1">I interpreted both of your initial statements as rejecting inquiry into 
things post-singularity.  It seems as if you both think we *can't* 
possibly know anything, so we shouldn't try.  Then in response</a> to my
<a name="0915qlink3">queries for clarification, you ask me to show you prediction textbooks 
with formulas derived from first principles.  

<p>
0) I submit my paper <a href="http://hanson.berkeley.edu/filluniv.pdf">http://hanson.berkeley.edu/filluniv.pdf</a>, as giving
<p>
   mathematical predictions derived from first principles regarding 
   an important aspect of post-singularity behavior. 
</a>
<a name="0915qlink4"><a name="0908qlink2">1) Humans have a vast amount of knowledge and insight, only the tiniest 
</a>
<p>
   fraction of which can be expressed as equations derived from first 
   principles.  It's a big mistake to say we know nothing about a subject
   if no such equations are presented.
</a>
</a>
<br>
<a name="0915qlink5"><a name="0908qlink3">2) Even if we knew nothing about a subject, that wouldn't mean
<p>
   we couldn't learn something if we put our minds to it.  You need a 
   much stronger argument to reject inquiry other than we don't know 
   anything now.
</a>
</a>
<br>
<a name="0915qlink6"><a name="0908qlink4">3) Human insight isn't indexed much by year of applicability.  The best
<p>
   experts in banking now know things relevant for forecasting post
   singularity banking.  People who understand art well know things 
   relevant for forecasting post-singularity art.  Just becasuse there
   isn't a book called "Post-singularity banking and art" Doesn't mean 
   people don't know things relevant for this.
</a>
</a>
<a name="0915qlink7"><a name="0908qlink5">4) For a subject a broad as "post-singularity", insight just isn't very
<p>
   discrete, since there is so much relevant knowledge.  We know more
   about the year 2098 now than we did in 1898, and likely will know
   more ten years from now.  Our insight improves incrementally, so 
   there is no cliff beyond which we know *nothing*.  I see no
   "horizons," analogous to where the curve of the Earth makes human 
   visual resolution suddenly fall to uselessness.
