Thanks to everybody who has responded to my request for information.  I 
am in the middle of moving house and finishing my PhD dissertation up in 
the next fortnight or so, and so don't have time to reply to all the 
posts.  They have, however, all been very helpful.  

<p>
On a more general note, there has recently been some discussion of the 
purpose of this mailing list.  One reader was disappointed at the lack of 
technical postings / discussion of new science and technology.

<p>
For my own part, I would much rather hear "personal stuff", in the sense 
of hearing how individuals on this list are making their own lives 
transhuman or extropian.   Excellent technical information is available 
from many other sources.  However, information about transhuman 
lifestyles is much thinner on the ground.  I find that hearing about 
other's attempts to create a transhuman lifestyle is inspiring.
