Abstract
<br>
  The effect of lifelong oral supplementation with ubiquinone
  Q10 (10 mg/kg/day) was examined in Sprague-Dawley rats and C57/B17 mice.
  There were no significant differences in survival or life-span found in
  either rats or mice. Histopathologic examination of different rat tissues
  showed no differences between the groups. In Q10 supplemented rats, plasma
  and liver Q10 levels were 2.6 to 8.4 times higher at all age points than in
  control rats. Interestingly, in supplemented rats the Q9 levels also were
  significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in plasma and liver at ages 18 and 24 months.
  Neither Q9 nor Q10 levels were affected by supplementation in kidney, heart,
  or brain tissues. In spite of the significant changes in plasma and liver
  ubiquinone concentrations, lifelong Q10 supplementation did
  not prolong or shorten the lifespan of either rats or mice.
