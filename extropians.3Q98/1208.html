This may turn out to be true, but dreaming isn't quite like VR.  With most
of my dreams, much of my mind seems to be asleep.  Bizarre events occur
and I don't even notice.  The story changes, I find myself somewhere
else without actually going there, etc.  As a dream author I seem to be
quite incompetent, and the only thing which saves me is the inattention
of my audience.

<p>
Creating a true artificial environment which can fool an alert, attentive
mind will be a more difficult task.  You may be correct that it will
be easier than simulating a mind, which will no doubt require massive
computing resources.  But dreams don't make the case.
