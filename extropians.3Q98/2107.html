The author's qualifications for writing this economic analysis, from
"<a href="http://www.amprom.org/FOUNDER.htm">http://www.amprom.org/FOUNDER.htm</a>" :

<p>
"Sheldon Emry was truly a pastor who fit the prophet Jeremiah's
description.Through his teachings many Christian Americans came to realize
just how meaningful world history really was. Because of his ability they
learned how to apply the Bible, God's Law, to their everyday lives and how
it should be applied to American government. It was through this special
God-given insight that Pastor Emry was able to show Americans the
importance of beinga Christian and a Patriot simultaneously. These
Americans were able to understand all these things because God Almighty
used Pastor Emry in the particular ministry He had called him to, to help
open their blinded eyes to their true identity as God's chosen people."

<p>
Hmmmmm. Could he be a somewhat biased author, with his own agenda, perhaps?
