<a name="1375qlink1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Don't worry about those few Extropian females dude, they're mostly...<br>

<p>
owwww.... {8-[   anyone can make comments like these just  to bait the group and

<p>
watch the wailing and gnashing of teeth.  the fact is, *we dont know who we
are.*
<br>
we have no statistics on those who read the extropian newsgroup.  many, if not
most
<br>
of the email addresses are nongendered, such as spike66 for instance.

<p>
i see that extropians tend to love privacy.  althoprivacy is not important to me

<p>
personally, i have gotten religion on the necessity of others to protect theirs.

<p>
so, question:  how can we find out how many women and how many men, how
many straight and how many gay, or just plain how many people are out there in
extropians
<br>
*without any single person having to reaveal any traceable information* about
themselves?

<p>
if we set up a website where anyone could anonymously log on and set down
gender and preference, then any one person could corrupt the entire database by
logging
<br>
on an indefinite number of times and in putting false information.  the person
who started the lesbian extropian meme might intentionally do this, for
instance.

<p>
on the other hand, if we had every respondant register in order to prevent
multiple
<br>
entries, then each response could be traced to an individual.  the most private
extropians (understandably) would not log on, which would also corrupt the
database.

<p>
so, i set forth this challange to all extropians:  come up with a means of
polling
<br>
the group in such a way that prevents any individual from logging on repeatedly,

<p>
without revealing the source of any single entry to protect the privacy of those

<p>
who answer the poll.  it must be done online, no writing on dead trees or
postage
<br>
stamps.  to the person who discovers such a means, i offer the grand prize of...

<p>
my undying admiration and deepest gratitude.  {8^)  spike
