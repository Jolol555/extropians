I'm not sure what you are saying.  But let me rephrase myself:  If two people are
agreeing to disagree about the rationality of one of them because that person in
question has information not available to the other person, at least one of them
is making a fundamental cognitive error.  One can better get what one wants 
(i.e., be more rational) by avoiding this error.  (Btw, an older version of my 
paper is at <a href="http://hanson.berkeley.edu/calibration.ps">http://hanson.berkeley.edu/calibration.ps</a>  I'll have a better version 
in a few days.)
