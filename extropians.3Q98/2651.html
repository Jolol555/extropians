Punctuated equilibrium is a poor model for that.  Change can be
fast but increases in ability are quite slow.  You may have a blizzard
of new fish species in the African lakes, but they're all still just
fish and not fundamentally different from fish everywhere.

<p>
The idea is that if you look at variation within a species you see 
relatively little, even when looking at geographically isolated groups; 
if you look at variation between species you see a lot.  So as long
as a species remains a single species not much changes; but during the 
speciation process a lot happens.

<p>
Wouldn't you say that if the exponential model fits for the important 
changes during speciation, it's not really relevant whether it fits
minor changes?  After all, had the minor changes not happened you'd
still have two distinct species; but had the ones modeled by the exponential
</a>
 model not happened, the species would be indistinguishable.
