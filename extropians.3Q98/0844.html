<p>
<a href="0784.html#0844qlink2">&gt;        &gt;No, closer to say that the "Randall Test" *includes* the Turing</a><br>
<pre>
Test,         
<br>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink3">&gt;        &gt;as it now stands.  </a><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If the Turing Test is unsound so is the Randall Test because that is its</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;foundation.</i><br>

<p>
The Turing Test is possibly only incomplete.

<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;The fact that a tape recorder can make those sounds, however,</i><br>
<pre>
does         
<br>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink4">&gt;        &gt;not mean that the same processes [consciousness] are going on</a><br>
in the      
<br>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink5">&gt;        &gt;tape recorder, since it is a different sort of machine. </a><br>
<i>&gt;               </i><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt;But in the real world that's not why people think a tape recorder is  </i><br>
<i>&gt;unintelligent and unconscious. Most people don't have the slightest idea</i><br>
of 
<br>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink6">&gt;how a tape recorder works, much less the human brain, they don't believe</a><br>
a 
<br>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink7">&gt;tape recorder is conscious is because it doesn't act that way, in other</a><br>
words
<br>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink8">&gt;they use the Turing Test.</a><br>

<p>
Because they have nothing better, yes.  However, 
wouldn't you agree that knowing how a tape recorder
works is a much surer route to knowing whether it is
conscious?  IOW, the Turing Test sorta works for this
purpose, but it is not the best way to tell.

<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Since we know, from personal experience, that human brains</i><br>
<pre>
*can* be        
<br>
<a href="0784.html#0844qlink9">&gt;        &gt;conscious, and we know that other human  brains do cause</a><br>
similar
<br>
<a href="0784.html#0844qlink10">&gt;        &gt;sounds to ours, we can assume that they are conscious, and</a><br>
begin our
<br>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink11">&gt;        &gt;study of consciousness with that.</a><br>
<i>&gt;               </i><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt;I agree its a reasonable assumption that other people who act</i><br>
intelligently 
<br>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink12">&gt;are conscious, its a reasonable assumption that an intelligent robot is </a><br>

<p>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink13">&gt;conscious too, but a reasonable assumption  is not the same as a </a><br>
<i>&gt;proof.</i><br>

<p>
Nope, but we can base proofs of other things on 
reasonable assumptions and evidence.

<p>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink14">&gt;        &gt;&gt;Me:</a><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;&gt;Where is the spatial location of green, or fast, or the number</i><br>
<pre>
        
<br>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink15">&gt;        &gt;&gt;eleven? </a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;*Certain* locations contain matter with  attributes  such as </i><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt;these.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Exactly. Right now there is only one location that contains matter with</i><br>
the 
<br>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink16">&gt;John Clark attribute, but that might not always be true.</a><br>

<p>
I would say that while consciousness in general is
an attribute, a particular consciousness is more 
complex than that.

<p>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink17">&gt;        &gt;&gt;Me:        </a><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;&gt;That's remembering the past not detecting time, </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;They are the same thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, one is subjective and the other objective.</i><br>

<p>
How do you know?  Have you ever objectively 
measured time?

<p>
<a href="0830.html#0844qlink18">&gt;         &gt;&gt;Without senses just how would you detect that I stopped </a><br>
<i>&gt;your brain         &gt;&gt;and then restarted it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;               </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;I don't know that I could.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then you couldn't detect time.</i><br>

<p>
Without the proper instruments, I can't tell
the elements that some indeterminate 
<br>
block of matter is made of.  Does that mean
that I cannot detect matter?  

<p>
I may not be able to detect *some* 
<br>
features of time, but that it exists, I can.
