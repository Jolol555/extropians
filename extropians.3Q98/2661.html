<a name="2675qlink1">  IAN: True enough, and there's no guarantee that 
  controlled laboratory research is immune from
  disinformation, i.e., results that were rigged,</a>
  although duplication of the research should 
  weed that out, so long as it's independent.

<p>
  Also, gathering information from a wider population 
<a name="2675qlink2">  has its advantages too.</a> In-line with what your
  talking about, I did a little research on the web 
  on a drug that a family member was taking... the 
  search yielded a bunch of posts and replies on 
  some mailing-list archives where people cited
  side effects they were having. Sure enough, 
  when I got to the scientific literature on the 
  drug, they were all there. And the official lists 
  of side effects are in fact simply gathered from 
  relatively small groups of people who simply report
  what they experience, and thus is basically anecdotal.

<p>
  Where laboratory research is critical is in understanding
  the exact  physiological mechanics of a drug's interaction
  with the body, and in that way we get a picture as to why it 
  does what it does, and that really explains what's happening.
  For example, if we know that chemical x is an antioxidant,
  even before it's taken internally, we can be pretty sure 
  of a given set of effects that it will have on users.
