You sound very sure of yourself.

<p>
You cannot mark the walls, you cannot distinguish
between them. You cannot even distinguish between
yourself, you're seeing the same thing, doing the
same thing. There are no differences.

<p>
<a href="0768.html#0793qlink4">&gt; Obviously we cannot agree on which wall to point</a><br>

<i>&gt; different locations, it is impossible for us to</i><br>
<i>&gt; both act and react identically.  As in this</i><br>
<i>&gt; situation, we must diverge.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0806qlink2">Agree? You can't even strike up a conversation</a> –
you’re talking to yourself.

<p>
Your problem with this scenario is not copying,
uploading, or consciousness, but location. What is
location? The wall in my example is in the same
location, prove me wrong.
