<i>&gt; &gt; Last week the archive of current posts went down. It came back up a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; days ago. When it came back and I did a search for Erik's posts using</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; terms such as 'Erik', 'Moeller', 'Cult', 'Fallacy' none of Erik's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; postings appeared. When I listed the posts by author, Erik was not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; there. Now the current archive is back down again. If the posts</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; suddenely 'reappear' when the archive comes back up then that will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; interesting. If by pointing out that Erik's posts were pulled got the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; powers that be to reinstate the old archive file with his posts then I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; glad. Either way though I think its troubling that the posts were</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; deleted in the first place.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Boog:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Did you read either my post or (more importantly) David McFadzean's post on</i><br>
<i>&gt; this topic yesterday? Not only were Erik's post's missing from the archive,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but at least *9 months* worth of posts were missing. You did an author</i><br>
<i>&gt; search (and so did I). Did you look at the dates? Apparently, everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; after March of '97 was missing from that year, due to some problem with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the software. This problem is apparently still not fixed. When it is, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; posts</i><br>
<i>&gt; that were missing (*9 months worth*) should be back.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Your author searches and keyword searches confirm that posts were missing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But</i><br>
<i>&gt; in no way do they confirm that *only certain posts by certain authors* were</i><br>
<i>&gt; missing. As I said, *I* couldn't find posts by other authors. Specifically,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I was searching for Kennita Watson and Will Wiser so I could find their</i><br>
<i>&gt; email addresses. Did someone have a reason to censor them? Or to delete 9</i><br>
<i>&gt; months worth of posts?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; *Please* consider the other evidence available to you here. Others will</i><br>
<i>&gt; confirm</i><br>
<i>&gt; that there were problems with the archives. Ask around. The problems have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been</i><br>
<i>&gt; talked about before. If you try to be just a little more rigorous and</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientific about this, I'm certain you'll find there are MUCH better</i><br>
<i>&gt; explanations for what has occured than censorship.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks for your consideration,</i><br>
