<p>
Lately I have been thinking about how difficult it must be to be a 
head of state.  The whole question of satisfying the majority of the 
people while maintaining the delicate balance of ecological and 
social values.

<p>
For example, imagine the Moses-type charismatic leader, screaming 
"let my people go!", to the current landlords.

<p>
What would that mean?

<p>
I imagine some kind of G7 or United Nations takeover of all broadcast 
channels, doing an emergency broadcast in the form of some kind of 
global announcement that the ownership of the earth is undergoing 
change, and that all previous private property agreements have been 
voided.

<p>
It might be something like, "People: we need to have talk.  We are 
experiencing a reorganization of unprecedented scale.  Our old 
economic ways have been ruled illegal by authorities beyond the reach 
of human beings.  You are no longer required to go to work.  You are 
no longer required to pay any bills.  We are in a state of managed 
transition to a new paradigm of authority and law.  If you are in a 
home, your mortgage is hereby declared paid in full.  If you are 
renting a home, that home in now declared your own private property, 
free and clear.  If you are renting an apartment, you are now a 
coowner of the building you are in, sharing that ownership with the 
others who share the same walls.  The water, gas, electric, and 
telephone services are now free for your use.  Internal combustion 
engines are hereby declared for emergency use only.  Food 
distribution will remain uninterrupted, with the exception of 
cost.  If you need something, go to the store, take it off the 
shelf, go through the cash register as you normally would.  
Imaginary money will be accepted, and the shelves will be restocked.  
The entire transportation system is in the process of being replaced. 
 Further details will be forthcoming."

<p>
When I think about this scenario, from my perspective as a worker in 
a treadmill, it at first sounds cathartic.  Go home, rest, sleep, 
relax, surf the web, call my family and friends, teleconference with 
my social peers, enjoy the silence of the traffic noise falling to 
nearly nothing, enjoy music, make love, eat, ride my bike on nature 
trails.

<p>
Of course, this greatly oversimplifies a transition state.

<p>
What would happen in the long run?

<p>
When I think about it, it occurs to me that work itself was some form 
of population control.  "Keeping the people busy, in order to prevent 
them from mating."

<p>
The level of lovemaking would be unprecedented.  Ecstatic liberated 
human animals would be enjoying food, wine, smoke, powder, and 
contact with each other as had never before been experienced.  For 
the first few weeks it would be like a psychedelic utopia.  However, 
soon thereafter, there would be a wave of insanity.  Excessive 
self-stimulation would lead to uncontrollable dimentia and 
psychological separation.  Some people would be completely catatonic 
in hypnotic drug states.  Others would be hyperagited from excessive 
use of nervous stimulants.  There would be the smell of rotting 
bodies, from self-induced overdosages.  Soon there would be an 
explosion of pregnancies.  The utopia would become a living hell.

<p>
Take Stock: LIQUID NITROGEN

<p>
Euthanasia coupled with cryonic suspension on an industrial scale 
would become a sanitary solution for temporary stasis.  
Since from an evolutionary perspective, the egg and uterus are 
orders of magnitude more essential than sperm, male sterilization 
via vasectomy would become a form of mass birth control.  Sperm banks 
would be created on an industrial scale.  Procreation would become 
exclusively a conscious decision requiring the consent of the woman, 
using artifical insemination or cloning.

<p>
Transportation systems would become exclusively electrical, and three 
dimensional.  (MEMS focused pulse laser computer guided shuttle 
systems, or something like that?)

<p>
Positive identification would be inevitable, due not to security 
requirements, but to ubiquitious advanced remote surveillance and 
tracking.

<p>
Direct modification of the brain would likely occur regardless of 
consent.  Physical agression would likely be detected and corrected 
by automated systems in a manner completely or nearly unnoticed by 
the individual.  High resolution virtual reality systems would be as 
close as a relaxed medidative state and indistinguishable from lucid 
dreams.  Verbal communication would likely be replaced with visual 
and tactile communication.  Facial expressions, gestures, and 
touches.  Imaginary social interactions would become 
indistinguishable from physical social interactions.  People would 
likely converse with each other silently, and would likely not 
corrupt the validy of their interactions with verbal expressions 
which would likely only serve to detract from the pleasure of knowing 
glances and mutual affection.
