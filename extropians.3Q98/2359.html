I see ethics and morality as non linear and am busy programing a
parallel version of The Ingrid Thought Processor to sum things in a non
linear way using Independant Component Analysis. Just now, on another
list dealing with Personal Construct Theory, I wrote:-

<hr>

<p>
I like a proposition that says there are 'gate' constructs that
separates to
<br>
a minimal extent both a rational set and an irrational set of constructs

<p>
within a single superordinate statespace but that when these constructs
are
<br>
either removed or reinforced then the space bifurcates and only one
remains
<br>
active within the stream of awareness. When I say 'either removed or
reinforced', I'm saying their (the gate construct's) positions as
independent
<br>
components are raised or lowered in significance. In a system</a> which uses

<p>
dendritic pruning to eradicate from memory, those failed or irrational
spaces,
<br>
there would be a meaninglessness to the loss of this information in that
it
<br>
couldn't be resurrected on future occasions and come back into play if
and
<br>
when the 'gate' constructs rose again in significance. I prefer an
independent component analysis definition that gently paralyzes the
irrational set.

<p>
I have used the above split/combination method to study conspiracy
theory
<br>
and have good examples showing the effect of these 'gate' constructs.
Incidentally, when the gate constructs are used to bind both rational
and
<br>
irrational spaces together it is interesting to see, in a plot over
time, of
<br>
cause and effect, that they (the cause and effect) are usually
orthogonal (90
<br>
degrees) to each other, whereas when the 'gate' constructs are removed
and
<br>
there is a bifurcation into two state spaces, then cause and effect are
more
<br>
often antagonistic (180 degrees) to each other. I feel it is therefore
possible to maintain a imperfect world view that contains the rational
and
<br>
irrational and still remain stable. However it is at a subordinate level

<p>
that the core or 'gate' construct kicks in to mediate behavior.

<p>
Is my understanding of a core construct correct, or does my definition
of a
<br>
'gate' construct refer to something else?
