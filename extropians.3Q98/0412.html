In response to Anders:

<p>
I think that the bubble of pseudo-science can be popped. Carl Sagan managed
to investigate and cut through, and left quite a reference of material from
which to draw. If someone who levitates wants to debate his belief in
levitation with me, I'd probably first decide if it is a conversation I'd
like to take on.  Not all battles are worth waging.

<p>
It is not my strategy to attempt to influence anyone who is vested in his
beliefs, but to influence by way of example.  Newagers are interested in
life extension (heaven, reincarnation, etc.), and happiness (the god
within) and diet (vegetarians, or at least conscious of diet).   If a
newager with whom I come in contact recognizes in me a sense of well being
- health and happiness - then he would probably want to know what my secret
is.  At this point, I would introduce a few ideas.  Timing is important.

<p>
I've had a lot of experience dealing with newagers either in Telluride, or
here in LA - the "center for newagers."  Many of my friends are newagers or
have mystical beliefs.  Over the years, they have come around more and
more; and over the years I have noticed an appreciation from them for my
work.  At my most recent party, two friends who have never shown interest
in transhuman ideas before, were talking about cryonics and a transhuman
Utopia.  Why?  Because they felt safe in my home in an inviting and
hospitable environment they could relax in.

<p>
Yes.  The idea is to get people to think critically, and this can be a
dilemma when one's moral issues are at stake.  For us, values are flexible.
 Form most people, values are cemented in their history.  Which brings the
ingredient of understanding, humor and common ground which can take off an
edginess.
