Buried in the article about tissue engineering was this tidbit:

<p>
  But the lack of government interest heretofore may have been
  a blessing in disguise.  Gail Naughton, president of Advanced
  Tissue Sciences Inc. (ATIS) of La Jolla, Calif., says that because
  so little federal money was available, tissue engineers had little
  choice in years past but to start a company and go public in order
  to raise funds.  ''I think that this field has moved so quickly
  toward reality precisely because it spent very little time in
  academic labs,'' she says.

Score one for honestly-funded science.
