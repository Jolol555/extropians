I get your point, which only indicates that such modifications need to be introduced as
'accidental' or 'incidental' mutations that nobody actually had a hand in. Yeah its
underhanded, but so what. However, if the uglier animal produces more meat, or more
healthy meat, it will be seen as a good thing, with the ugliness only being incidental.
The point is that the 'Cute' factor is what sells animal rightism and vegetarianism
(which is why many more women than men are one or the other). Engineering ugliness into
any improved meat producing organism will reduce the amount of public aversion to it
being slaughtered for McNuggets. Though there may also be a bit of an uck factor, as in
"EEEEWWWW! You're gonna eat THAT???!!!

<a name="1113qlink1">BTW, I had an ostrich steak dinner last week, and it was fabulous. While the meat is
lean, it is very flavorful, and not tough. Ostrich is a good candidate for an optimum
meat producer: a)very healthy meat, b) very ugly c)very ornery and obnoxious. I
recommend that anyone who has been avoiding red meats for health reasons to try ostrich
steak.</a>
