I'll grant that this is plausible.  

<p>
On reflection, it seems to me that even if most of the big change
genes are fixed at speciation, and even if most of the fitness variance
is explained by these, its still not clear that most of the biological 
innovation happens at speciation.  Speciation may mostly allow previous
potential to be realized by relaxing modularity constraints.  Within
the larger species, a variation must be ready to work with most of the
genes out there.   In the new small species, gene combinations can get
rewarded for working together, even if they each work poorly with other 
possible genes.  Between speciation, the big species collects lots of
possible genes, and combinations of these are tried in new small groups
to see if some combination is a winner.
