<p>
I don't think it is.  There's an important distinction to be made here: 
would a SI's behaviour be incomprehensible all of the time, some of the 
time, or never?  My example was intended to illustrate that there may be 
at least some "thought processes" allowed by the laws of nature which we 
cannot possibly hope to follow in detail, even in principle. 

<p>
This does not mean that those are necessarily the only, or even the most 
important thought processes to understand.  I still hold, however, that 
this example invalidates Damien's "Very vague thesis".

<i>&gt; envision a future with them?</i><br>

<p>
Certainly not.  I'd say it's a very worthwhile task.

<p>
An already-existing example may be useful here, the quantum factoring 
algorithm due to Shor.  Assuming large-scale quantum computers 
can be built, it ought to be possible to use that factoring algorithm to 
factor numbers which cannot be factored using our classical algorithms, 
even given a computer the size of the observed Universe.

<p>
It is believed that classical computational devices (including human brains) 
cannot efficiently follow, in detail, the operations used in the 
factoring algorithm.  At a working level, it is "incomprehensible" to 
human beings.  Yet a human being, using higher level tools, was still 
able to dream up that factoring algorithm, and prove that it works within 
the framework of quantum mechanics!

<p>
It seems to me that what is needed here is a robust abstract framework 
that can be used to understand the behaviour of a SI.  Sure, we may not 
be able to follow the details of the SI's thought processes, but we can 
still make broadly applicable statements about the SI.  Rather like the 
relationship of thermodynamics to mechanics for complicated systems -- we 
can't follow the detailed mechanics, but we still have some general 
principles to use.
