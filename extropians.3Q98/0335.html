To the extent that LES supports individualization of that protocol (and this
is what I hear from their local chapter)--I support it.  If someone from the
LES is saying that this protocol, and no other, is going to make you live
longer, that should raise some flags.

<p>
Two very important points to keep in mind in any supplementation program:


<OL>
  <li>  A thorough knowledge of the effects and contradictions of EVERY
component of EVERY supplement.  People have unknowingly sabotoged their own
efforts due to drug interactions, insufficient or too high dosage, and
inattention to body responses.  Specific medical problems may require
changes in supplementation, or the addition of supplements not in the
protocol, to achieve full effect.

  <li>  Changing supplement brands after taking one consistently for a year.
The base ingredients can cause intolerance just as can result from eating
the exact same foods 
very day.  This can be frustrating after finding that 'perfect' combination
pill, I know!  But malabsorption means throwing money down the drain.


</OL>

Live long and sinfully,
