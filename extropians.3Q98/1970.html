<a name="2007qlink1"><a name="1976qlink1">Doubtless the 50 million Americans living in poverty appreciate having 
some power, food and answering machines, while 80% of the wealth lies 
with the top 10%. Ever do a graph of what that looks like? Perhaps you 
could debate it with the starving millions across the world. Doesn't 
America store enough grain to feed the world for a decade in the event 
of a nuclear war? Now it's asking other countries to do</a> that for it.

<a name="1976qlink2">To think, how little it would take for the elite of the superwealthy to 
provide food and power for the bottom third. How very little. How very 
very little.</a>

<p>
<a name="1976qlink3">The Australian Government gives one third of one percent of GDP to 
foreign aid. America is equally generous. Private citizens who are 
wealthy give a pittance.</a> 

<p>
For those of us who have a strong conception of morality, the surety of 
an impending nanotech bounty (presuming America does not decree its 
knowledge US-owned - like atomic weapons or particle beam projection 
systems) makes us wish to be more generous NOW. When it means even more. 
<a name="1976qlink4">If I ever become wealthy, I intend to put half my wealth into a fund 
were the interests goes to the third world and the promotion</a> of 
nanotech.
