To obtain a structure from a pattern of photons that make it through a piece
of matter is esentially a diffraction problem.  The trade-offs in wavelengths
of the radiation affect resolution (in space and time) and  the amount of
information recoverable.  This trade-off is similar to the quantum uncertianty
of time and energy , position and momentum (Heisenburg).  Spatial precision
necessary can be argued, depending on assumptions to be 1e-5 meters to 1e-10
meter scale (neuron structure --&gt;protein structure --&gt;atom locatons).  So this
means probably shorter wavelengths than IR.   High intensities or very
energetic photons have the upper limitation also Heisenburg like, of
perturbing the system that they are trying to probe (thermal effects to
breaking of molecular bonds).  

<p>
X-rays currently do very large proteins.  The structures are deconvoluted and
can be simulated, the analogous goal of uploading.  For them, the
computational requirements are absolutly state of the art.  In the mid 80s, my
advisor did x-ray photoelectron diffraction experiments.  He simulated the
real structures, and the diffraction patterns of two dimensonal crystal
surfaces.  He ran his code on the fastest  Cray available.
