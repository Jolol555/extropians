<a name="1914qlink1">Yes, people here have proposed that the first SIs or what have you will come
from the super wealthy. Also, excuse me; but when you sandbag by saying it
takes a limited understanding of economics and politics to become worried over
these matters aren't you being patronizing, to say the least?</a> In fact the more
understanding I get the more worried I become that there are undeniably
plausible conspiracies out there amongst the blinkered Skull and Bones types
on this planet which will meet out real doom towards the world's poor. Why is
it then, that when I had less understanding I was less worried?
