FYI

If you are in Los Angeles there is a good SF/fantasy store in Sherman Oaks.
Dangerous Visions-- And they do seperate their collections. They also have a

<a href="0000.html#0049qlink1">&gt;Today I was traveling eastbound on Interstate thirty in Texas and I passed a</a><br>
<i>&gt;"Books a Million" on the right hand side of the interstate near the state line</i><br>
<i>&gt;in Texarkana.  Cursory examination at sixty miles per hour revealed that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;was eighteen wheeler accessable so I pulled in.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was running low on books.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Immediately acquiring a cup of overpriced coffee (hazelnut from the yuppie</i><br>
<i>&gt;coffe salon)...I begin to browse the stacks.  Since I was time limited I only</i><br>
<i>&gt;looked into the Science Fiction and The Science and Technology shelves.  Which</i><br>
<i>&gt;didn't take very long.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Happily this was one of the few stores that I've seen that seperates the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Science Fiction from the Trekkie stuff AND from the blatant fantasy (elves,</i><br>
<i>&gt;swords, dragons and such drivel)  Unhappily the drivel outnumbered the Science</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiction by probably two to one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Still...I managed to find a couple of books...including one by Peter Hamilton.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I looked for Banks but to no avail</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It took quiet a search to find the Science section...it was so tiny.  I doubt</i><br>
<i>&gt;there were fifty books all told.  Even so I managed to acquire on that looks</i><br>
<i>&gt;interesting.  "Visions" by Michio Kaku.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But I also got angry.  (not an uncommon occurance for me...my "contempt"</i><br>
<i>&gt;runneth over all too often.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There...sitting next to the Feynman lectures on Physics....was the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Quickening" by Art Bell.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I  couldn't let this slide and after some reflection I went and complained to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the manager.  I told him that it would be no less insulting to put say...the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Bible in his Girlie Book section (I dunno if he even had one...but I was</i><br>
<i>&gt;digging for a comparison)...I told him that "The Quickening" had no more to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;with Science than Tinkerbell had to do with astrophysics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;He was somewhat taken aback and seemed suprised that I should be upset.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;further told him that there were probably five or six stacks devoted to such</i><br>
<i>&gt;nonsense and only one or two SHELVES devoted to Science...so I'd appreciate it</i><br>
<i>&gt;if it were kept "pure"...and not contaminated with such nonsense.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;He told me the classification came from "corporate".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It figures.  A college degree can do wonders.</i><br>
