Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.  The body that used to
be live, now has a bullet in its brain and is not alive.  But you don't
see a dead body.  Surely you are speaking metaphorically?  Surely you
agree that it is a dead body, but it's "OK"?  

<p>
<a href="0692.html#0697qlink2">&gt; It didn't have to jump because if consciousness has a spatial location, which</a><br>

<i>&gt; The brain by itself has no way of detecting position, or time for that matter.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0729qlink1">Mysticism Alert!  You seem to be saying that consciousness exists
outside of the physical body, outside space and time, and that space and
time and position</a> and laws of physics don't apply to this ethereal
consciousness.  This allows a copy to be made, and for "you" to
instantly appear, faster-than-light, in a new location without really
moving.

<p>
<a name="0729qlink2">Definition Change Alert!  Your definiton of "killing" and "death"
obviously are not based on any definition of "life" and "death" that
have existed until now.</a>  Please clearly define these new definitions for
these words.  Until now, I have never heard that you can put a bullet
through someone's brain and not call it murder based on what thoughts
are inside their head.  Certainly this is not the usual definiton of
"killing"?

<p>
<a href="0692.html#0697qlink4">&gt; If you kill me instantly and without warning I'll never know I'm dead which</a><br>
<i>&gt; is good but unless I have a copy I'll never know I'm alive either which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; bad. If I do have a copy I still won't know I'm dead but I will know I'm</i><br>

<i>&gt; my definition of death is having a last thought and in this scenario they are</i><br>

<p>
Circular Logic Alert!  This only works if you assume, as you do, that
both copies are "you" and that the new copy's thought is a continuation
of the original copy's thought.<a name="0729qlink3">  If you assume, as I do, that the two
copies are two seperate but<a name="0748qlink1"> identical people, then your original copy
</a>
did have its last thought, while the new copy had its first original
</a>
thought.  This doesn't support what you believe, but merely states it.

<p>
By the very nature of circular logic relying on the pre-assumed beliefs,
I think that you and I can agree on your entire paragraph, but based on
our original belief come up with different conclusions.  This is why
these examples seem to go nowhere, because we both agree with the
examples in toto.  But the circular-logic in the example points to
pre-existing assumptions, wherein we differ, so each of us "proves" our
own point with the same circular-logic example.

<p>
Self-Referencing Evidence Alert!<a name="0729qlink4">  Is there any way to test the original
</a>
to see if it is not dead?  Since the identity of the copy is at issue
here, it is not valid to reference it as proof as to what it is.  This
is like quoting the Bible to prove that it is the Word of God.  It is
self-referencing circular-logic.  We<a name="1664qlink1"> must be able to measure</a> the
original to see if still continues.  If you wish to move the measuring
devices from location to another, you must first prove that by doing so
you are following and measuring the same thing as was originally
measured.  If you change the reference point in the middle without
reason, then there is no reason to think that both things being measured
are the same.

<p>
<a href="0692.html#0697qlink5">&gt; I think the basic difference is that I don't think I'm a noun, I'm not matter,</a><br>
<i>&gt; I'm the complex way matter reacts when it is organized in a certain way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think people are more like music than bricks. </i><br>

<p>
Straw-man Alert!<a name="0729qlink5">  You seem to assume that I and others who think as I do
are giving some significance to our specific atoms.</a>  This is not
necessary for our objection.  I have seen numerous examples given here
to explain away the physical matter requirement.  I think that is a
straw-man position that you and others are projecting.  I haven't seen
anyone here claim it, and I certainly don't.

<p>
Platonic Mysticism Alert!  The question is whether two identical copies
of anything can exist.  You and others seem to say that they cannot, and
as soon as they become identical, they become one.  This is the old
Platonic Forms argument, that there is only one true form of every
object, and that all such instances are really the same object expressed
in different locations.  I and others do not believe in Plato's forms,
and if we see two people, we think they are two people.  No matter how
closely similar they become, the still are two people.  At no point do
they become so similar that the magically and instantly become one.

<p>
Sorry for all the "alerts!", but I'm trying to point out logical flaws.
I'm tired of the conversation going around and around and going nowhere.
So, I'm trying to be more specific about where logic flaws lay, or why a
specific belief is rejected, or where definitions are changing.  I hope
this will more directly analyze the problem and help the discussion move
along.
