<p>
That's from the pre-trial psychological conditions.  Changes in
psychological state after the screening test don't affect internet
use, by their model.

<p>
<a href="2024.html#2025qlink2">&gt;Re-examining Table 3, I find reasons for caution.  Their format is odd,</a><br>

The study's nowhere near large enough to conclude that for depression.
With loneliness, the difference should be significant because the
association between usage and pre-study is negative, while the post
study association is positive.  

<p>
<a name="2027qlink2">The details of the study were better than the summary implied.  I'd like
to see the results without the internet usage hours truncated.  If there
is a causal relationship, extremely heavy users should be very messed up.
One hypothesis would be internet addiction, a la gambling/alcohol/etc
addiction.  In this case, light and moderate users should be fine and
the heavy users will be the ones with the problems.</a>  Destructive 
addictive behaviors often have tangled causal relationships - depression
make you drink, drinking makes you depressed, etc.

<p>
FWIW, I find the internet unsatisfying as a social medium.  I speak much
faster than I type and I much prefer the phone.
