<p>
<a href="2664.html#2682qlink1">&gt;The Internet is great but I don't think it could</a><br>
<i>&gt;compete with all of that.</i><br>


<p>
I must say that I find that the last few years with www, e-mail and all that
has been some of the most satisfying years of my (non peronal) life.

<p>
<a href="2664.html#2682qlink2">&gt;Computers didn't effect the average person much in 1949 but many of the</a><br>
<i>&gt;basic principles of their operation had already been discovered by</i><br>
<i>&gt;Turing, Von Neumann, Shannon and others</i><br>

<p>
The problem with computers is that they make inventions seem transparent and
allmost too easy.
<br>
To say that many people has computers and when everybody has one that the
development has then stopped, until a new technological tool comes along and
transforms the world, is dead wrong.

<p>
Each little piece of software is potentially a new invention. Each little
piece of software can mean more than any af the old hardware inventions.
Imagine how the internet revolution would have happened if everything had
had to be made in hardware.... The browser hardware, the mail hardware, the
mp3 hardware.... etc. The rante of invention is racing along today, we just
don't notice it as it is hidden in upgrades and downloads.
