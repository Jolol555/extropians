In a sense your 'natural' construct as used by the advertiser gets somewhat
close to uncovering what I meant as a 'gate' construct. Here's another
example:

<p>
Take an enzyme, say elastase and visualize its shape to be like that of a
lima bean. In the middle of the saddle area is a small hole and at the
bottom of this hole is a trigger. Ok? Now, another enzyme has the function
of regulating the amount of elastase in the lung and it is small enough to
get down this hole and activate the trigger which breaks the elastase in
two. Split into two pieces the halves of the elastase enzyme are small
enough to pass through the lung wall and exit into the blood stream. The
normal job of elastase is to 'eat' away deadened bits of lung and if too
much is present it will devour good lung as well. Now, say, the owner of all
this elastase smokes cigarettes. The smoke itself blocks this 'hole' thus
preventing the regulator from triggering the breakup. Soon not enough lung
is left to pass oxygen to the blood and without oxygen red bloods cells
clump together and these bigger clumps can't get down to the end of
capillaries so the cells there turn to anaerobic reproduction and become
cancerous. Stress and other things can cause red blood cells to clump
together but the tiny trigger in elastase is an example of my 'gate'
construct and when seen in terms of cognitive flows through an associative
net it is similar to your individual not being able to see past the
advertiser's tricks as to the true nature of what was happening.
