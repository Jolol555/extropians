Possibly a shift in the thread..

<p>
A laser sufficiently powerful to ionize an air column strongly enough 
to carry current sufficient to deter or injure a human would by 
itself be a very dangerous or lethal weapon. Death ray, anyone?

<p>
<a name="0524qlink1">The other business I am involved in seeks nonlethal solutions to 
problems such as high speed car chases and similar situations where 
the police now use guns or main force. One idea I had was a charged 
stream of liquid to carry a current, a'la taser. I constructed a 
prototype with two Super Soakers mounted on a common pistol grip, and 
a 20 kV pulse generator connected so that the water streams would 
complete a circuit on the target. Testing resulted in the conclusion 
that a liquid stream cohesive enough to act at greater than three 
feet range would in itself carry enough energy to be able to seriousl 
injure the person aimed at. Also, simply wearing a raincoat renders 
the gadget useless.</a>

<p>
<a name="0524qlink2">About this time I applied for a patent on the device on the chance it 
could be somehow debugged - and found that another company had beaten 
us to the punch. Their disclosure, unfortunately, missed all the 
information my experiments turned up, so that their device is likely 
also useless.</a>

<p>
<a name="0524qlink3">Other ideas could be use of phased sound - low frequencies have been 
shown to disorient wihtout causing permanent harm, but are terribly 
hard to project, and ultrasonics can cause discomfort, but the power 
level needed is again possibly dangerous. There has been mention in 
trade journals of an ultrsonic 'speaker' that can direct audio to an 
apparent location in free space by using collimated ultrasonic beams 
that have beat notes in the range of the desired frequency. The air 
itself becomes the radiator.</a> 

<p>
Perhaps I have said too much...
