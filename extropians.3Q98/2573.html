I want to thank ExI, Robin Hanson and most of all Vernor Vinge for making the
Singularity discussion valuable. I thought the respondent essays were adequate
though I did not see anything really new there. Eliezer Yudkowsky's posts were
extremely interesting and thought provoking. I also thought Doug Bailey's
posts about Strong and Weak Superintelligences were very salient. I hope to
see more Singularity discussion in the near term. Its obvious the subject is a
huge one. Even if the Singularity concept turns out to be flawed, the amount
of thought it focuses on future issues makes it worth it either way. Thanks
again.
