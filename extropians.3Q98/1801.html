<p>
Modifying the same synapse at the same time is likely a problem, but
not as problematic as having two processes writing to the cortex at
the same time - their memories would become linked, so you would have
chaotic mixed memories where you (say) simultaneously eat an icecream
and engage in a flamewar on the net, with some elements completely
impossible to separate. Sounds rather disruptive.</a>

<i>&gt; the same day (for a big net, not for a kid), but there might be ways</i><br>
<i>&gt; to reduce this likelyhood: lock parts of the brain until consolidation?</i><br>

<p>
Probably not a good idea for the prefrontal cortex (shorter term
memory), and likely we need some consolidation-like processes
elsewhere too for the quick learning that goes on all the time.

<p>
<a href="1800.html#1801qlink3">&gt;      Do you know how the net incorporates new neurons and grow</a><br>
<i>&gt; synapses, axons, dendrites: is it chemically and topologically driven?</i><br>

<p>
Likely a bit of both. We don't know yet, but there are definitely
chemical signals and perhaps others.

<p>
<a href="1800.html#1801qlink4">&gt; A function like: grow toward that chemical source at a rate</a><br>
<i>&gt; proportional to its importance?</i><br>

<p>
Sounds like a good first approximation. There has been some
theoretical work on how the chemical gradients ought to look to give
an optimal growth performance, and they seem to fit reality quite
well.
