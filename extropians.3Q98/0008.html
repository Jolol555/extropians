Abstract
<br>
  Preliminary experiments have shown that a diet containing 10% rapeseed oil
  (low-erucic acid) markedly shortens the survival time of stroke-prone
  spontaneously hypertensive (SHRSP) rats under 1% NaCl
  loading as compared with diets containing perilla oil or soybean oil.
  High-oleate safflower oil and high-oleate sunflower oil were found to have
  survival time-shortening activities comparable to that of rapeseed oil; olive
  oil had slightly less activity. A mixture was made of soybean oil, perilla
  oil, and triolein partially purified from high-oleate sunflower oil to adjust
  the fatty acid composition to that of rapeseed oil. The survival time of this
  triolein/mixed oil group was between those of the rapeseed oil and soybean
  oil groups. When 1% NaCl was replaced with tap water, the survival time was
  prolonged by approximately 80%. Under these conditions, the rapeseed oil and
  evening primrose oil shortened the survival time by approximately 40% as
  compared with n-3 fatty acid-rich perilla and fish oil; lard, soybean oil,
  and safflower oil with relatively high n-6/n-3 ratios shortened the survival
  time by roughly 10%. The observed unusual survival time-shortening activities
  of some vegetable oils (rapeseed, high-oleate safflower, high-oleate
  sunflower, olive, and evening primrose oil) may not be due to their unique
  fatty acid compositions, but these results suggest that these vegetable oils
  contain factor(s) which are detrimental to SHRSP rats.
