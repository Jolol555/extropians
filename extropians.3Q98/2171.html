<i>&gt;From Vernor Vinge, foreword to "True Names And Other Dangers": </i><br>

<pre>
      "I wanted interstellar empires (interplanetary ones at the 
      least).  I wanted supercomputers and artificial 
      intelligence and effective immortality.  All seemed 
      possible, yet there were inescapable consequences of 
      unbridled optimism..."

</pre>
<p>
A good philosophy is one that contradicts you, rather than conforming 
to your wishes.  When this happens it means that your philosophy runs 
on its own rails, that it has logic and integrity, rather than being a 
means of rationalization.  Vinge, growing up in the 1950s, wanted 
interstellar empires, and I, growing up in the 80s and 90s with a copy 
of "Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition", wanted to walk, 
uploaded, through my favorite worlds of SF and fantasy; to build my 
own planet, make my mind faster and free from pain, explore the galaxy 
with effective immortality, and so on.  My dreams had a shiny 
cyberspace finish, but they were not any more imaginative.  (Although 
one rather wonders what will happen to my little brother, growing up 
with a copy of "The Spike".)

<p>
Then I happened to take a copy of "True Names" out of the library, and 
my world was altered.  On paragraph two, page 47, when I read the 
sentence "When this happens, human history will have reached a kind of 
singularity - a place where extrapolation breaks down and new models 
must be applied - and the world will pass beyond our understanding."  
The first thing I thought was "Yes, he's right," and the next thing 
was, "I now know how I will be spending the rest of my life."  A few 
months later, I published "Staring Into The Singularity" and got large 
chunks of it wrong.

<p>
I knew about the Singularity, I had a new dream, and I'd even lost the 
old dreams, but this new dream was suspiciously malleable to my own 
desires.  I was sure that "the Powers will be ethical", and that this 
meant I would survive and be upgraded to a Power.  I did spend a lot 
of time telling people to worry about getting to the Singularity, 
instead of detailing the Utopia that would come afterwards.  And I was 
particularly scathing about certain failures of imagination.  I'd made 
progress, I'd increased the imaginativeness and power of my 
philosophy, but it was still obeying me instead of vice versa.

<p>
<a name="2177qlink1">Now I am still sure that the Powers will be ethical, but I am no 
longer sure that this precludes taking us apart for spare atoms.  I no 
longer think that our continued survival has to threaten the Powers 
for us to be erased; I am now willing to accept that simple efficiency 
may require it.  I am willing to accept that life may be meaningless.  
I am willing to accept that the only reward for all my service will be 
a painful death, for myself, for those I love, and for the entire 
human race.  Only when one can accept all possibilities is one ready 
to choose between them.

<p>
The power of the Singularitarian philosophy is that it draws on 
concepts with more force than our own desires.  Over time, over years, 
it corrodes away our rationalizations.  And above all, it presents an 
emotionally and rationally acceptable course of action, even after all 
the darkest alternatives are accepted.  It really doesn't matter what 
the relative probabilities are.  Either life has meaning,</a> or it 
doesn't; either human life has meaning, or it doesn't; either we'll be 
upgraded, or we'll die.  So we'll die?  All the other generations have 
died.  It's not some major tragedy because it happens to me instead of 
somebody else.  So humanity will die?  In a billion years, it is 
certain that humanity will die.  Is it so horrible if humanity dies 
giving birth to something greater, giving meaning to all our dead 
ancestors?  Sooner or later, some generation will face the choice 
between Singularity and extinction.  Why push it off, even if we 
could?  And besides, we might not die at all.

<p>
<a name="2177qlink2">Because my best-guess dedication to the Singularity is fairly 
unaffected by the above probabilities varying between 0% and 90%, I 
can calmly and without worry evaluate arguments for and against.  I 
can accept that every possibility might be real.  The Singularity, 
through it all, is the only sane way to go.  In accepting every 
possibility, I can also accept the dictates of my own philosophy; I 
don't need to distort it to avoid "unacceptable" outcomes.

<p>
We must each lose our dreams in order to grow, but not in despair.  We 
must abandon the small dreams of childhood, but without abandoning the 
ability to dream.  For there are two ways in which a dream may be 
broken; by the death of hope, or by a greater dream.  To acknowledge 
that we do not command the future, is not to say that we do not make 
it; and when we tear our eyes away from our yearnings, we may look 
upward to the sun, forward to tomorrow.</a> 

<p>
<a name="2177qlink3">Forward to the day when humanity awakens from its dream, to the 
ultimate shattering of Maya.  To the day when the greatest hacker of 
them all compiles the very last line of code, and looks out at an 
early morning sky, knowing that he looks on the Final Dawn.  To the 
day when it is said, in the tradition of Oppenheimer who looked upon 
another sun:  "I am become Singularity, Breaker of Dreams."</a>
