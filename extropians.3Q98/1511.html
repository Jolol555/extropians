I don't see how that is relevant: the "assumptions" that my reply 
referred to included the assumption that the observer-moment version 
of the DA works. Given this assumption the reasoning goes as follows: 
You could have found that your present consciousness-moment was one 
of a late Superbeing (maybe remembering once having been a biological 
human). Instead you find that it is one of a biological human. What 
does this say about the relative number of the Superbeing 
observer-moments compared to the number of human observer-moments? If 
the time version of the DA is right, and all these observer-moments 
belong to the same reference class, then it says that the number of 
Superbeing observer-moments is very likely not very much greater than 
the number of human observer-moments. That the Superbeings might 
remember once having been human makes no difference.
