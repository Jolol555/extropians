In a message dated 98-08-05 13:50:59 EDT, you write:

<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; This wouldn't happen if the public had regular exposure to the source of
<br>
<a href="1168.html#1191qlink1"> &gt; their food... ask someone who grew up on a REAL farm and slaughtered the</a><br>
<i> &gt; same animals they raised how squeamish they are.  In that situation, the</i><br>
<i> &gt; meat consumer is involved not only in the grub but in supporting the</i><br>
<i> &gt; animal, getting to know it.  By the same token, a hunter taking meat from</i><br>
<i> &gt; other free beasts has a respect for the animal, a special relationship</i><br>
<i> &gt; unknown to the masses huddled up to the teat of factory farms.</i><br>
 
<p>
 yes, an individual who has never had to directly associate their daily food
 supply with them actively harvesting animals tends to have a reduced
inhibition
<br>
 to anthropomorphize animals.
<br>
  &gt;&gt;

<p>
I'm not sure what you're saying exactly, but I knew someone who was raised on
a slaughter farm, and is a strict vegetarian today.
