&lt;&lt; The point is that the 'Cute' factor is what sells animal rightism and

 (which is why many more women than men are one or the other). Engineering
ugliness into

 any improved meat producing organism will reduce the amount of public
aversion to it

 being slaughtered for McNuggets. Though there may also be a bit of an uck
factor, as in

 "EEEEWWWW! You're gonna eat THAT???!!!

	Indeed.  I for one seriously doubt that, if the situation had arose sooner,
there would be massive campaigns to "Save The Sloth".  Also, this is the very
reason the nature has provided us with newborn children (as well as young
toddlers), who are just too cute and adorable to even imagine hurting or
devouring (Why don't we eat our young?).  Nature has instigated the "Cute
Factor" to protect us from iradicating our own species out of sheer
frustration and indifference.
