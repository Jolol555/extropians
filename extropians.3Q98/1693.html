Uh, how? The best I could see would be to set a timer which would delete
their process after 8 hours, but can you really see yourself working hard
when you know that in eight hours you'll die? This is a copy of you we're
talking about, remember?

Uh, how? It's all very well to talk about "programming copies" and 
</a>
"assimilating information", but as far as I'm aware no-one has a clue 
as to how to program a neural network or assimilate parts of one into 
another.

the duplicates really are exact duplicates rather than different versions 
of the same person? Everything I can think of seems to have gone the
'Jekyll and Hyde' route.
