<p>
Okay Mitch !

<p>
Here is my academy award style leaving speech.

<p>
You hate me ! You really hate me !

<p>
I think it is clear that I don't fit in here.
I have been on the list for a long time and I
have seen things go to SHIT. I will unsubscribe
at some point.

<p>
Science and technology obviously have nothing
to do with the new age philosophy of "Extropy".

<p>
As a transhumanist "Extropy" makes no sense.
Transhumanism is science, science, science,
technology, technology, technology. 

<p>
And by the way I have MORALITY AND ETHICS.
Some of you sick fucks probably think it is cool
to kill people. This is for you.

<p>
" One day you will come face to face with a power<br>
  so unimaginably vast it could reorder the Earth itself." 


<p>
NO PHILOSOPHY

<p>
PHILOSOPHY is for people who are too dumb 
to do science : )

<p>
It is nonsense. Increasing a substance which 
does not exist and never will exist. I really do not
understand where Max is coming from with this -
<br>
"There is Entropy thus there must be Extropy" <br>

<p>
Well Duh !?

<p>
Take a dunce cap Max and go sit in the corner.

<p>
I think Max needs to look at a thermodynamics
text. I think he has no understanding of physics.

<p>
I think Max need to take Physics 1A.

<p>
I have brought this up with scientists and they
thought I was a cup cake. Max can not be totally
stupid however. I do admire how he has brain washed
both 40 year old engineers and 20 year old computer
nerds alike. I really admire that. Max you must have
some brains after all. If you wrote a book on how to
manipulate people for profit I would be knocking your
door down for the first copy : )

<p>
Of course we all want things to be better, bigger
and to be more. Why Max is calling this Extropy
is beyond any rational comprehension.

<p>
I like the play on words by the way. Max More ! 

<p>
Max More also believes in capitalism. 
<br>
I believe in capitalism more than anyone on this
list. I think BILL GATES IS A FUCKING GENIUS !
Anyone who can manipulate the whole world like
that is not dumb.

<p>
However....

<p>
I and other transhumanists believe that capitalism
is obsolete and there is no need to hoard the wealth.
The transhuman goal is to obtain wealth to make
that happen.

<p>
Nanoteck and SI will take care of that. HTML, LINUX
anyone see a pattern forming. FREE FREE FREE
Bill Gate's has served a purpose and that's that.

<p>
If all that above still did not register with the NEW
AGE AIR HEAD nothing will. I suggest you go and
have a nice herbal bath and listen to your wind chimes.

<p>
If you are a computer or science geek and you have
lost your way like I have - Extropy is not the answer. 
If you are wise you will see what I have seen. Read every
single sentence of the Principles over and over until you see.

<p>
I know for a fact that only a few of you have ever read
the principals from TOP to BOTTOM. I urge you to do
this NOW. 

<p>
If Max really meant well he would have only a couple
of sentences. Short and sweet.

<p>
There would be a basic right statement.
<br>
There would be a science and technology statement.

<p>
Read them over and over and over....


<p>
P.S - R.I.P

<p>
Max More wants to REMOVE limits to killing humans
and HAL like computer intelligences. It is all in there.
He would not blink if anyone on this list was bashed
over the head with a hammer until they were dead.
In fact I have a nasty feeling that it might turn him on.

<p>
Just a bit anyway..... : (

<p>
ETHICS AND MORALITY CAN NOT EVOLVE

<p>
Max Is A Manson Type. 

<p>
They are forever fixed like the set of INTEGERS

<p>
READ IT PROPERLY. Max More thinks libertarians
are queers. Max More is not a libertarian like I thought
he was. Max More is a thug who hides behind liberty
to further his agenda. By the way Max More thinks
the greatest scientist of the century Alan Turing
is a faggot. Just thought you would all like to know.
It is a fucking insult.

<p>
And If any of you new age philosophy types still
can't see the light of day. Ask yourself this.

<p>
Why isn't he in denial mode, eh, eh ?
<br>
He isn't man enough to face me on his own
fucking list. Pathetic. I have the run of the place
at the moment and he says nothing. Pathetic.

<p>

somewhere safe.</a>
