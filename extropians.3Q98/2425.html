<p>
Who is accredited to certify nuts? And are nuts ISO 14000 compliant?</a> :-)

<p>
<a name="2443qlink2">Soleri's writings strike me as rather typical of architects: lots of
vague, artsy neologisms, with some quite realistic ideas mixed in with
social speculations. Hardly enough to put him in the nut category.</a> One
<a name="2443qlink3">might disagree with his ideas, but they are not entirely out of the
</a>window. 

<p>
<i>&gt; And,</i><br>
<a href="2423.html#2425qlink2">&gt; if not, could someone explain to me what religion</a><br>
<i>&gt; and "Omega seeds" have to do with Architecture.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2443qlink4">I have the impression that Soleri is 1) very interested in creating
working, sustainable communities, and this is of course related to
religion in the sense of community-building.</a> He seems to quite happily
borrow useful ideas<a name="2443qlink5"> from religion, such as how to make austerity into
something positive.</a> 2) he is in some sense a follower of Teilhard de
<a name="2443qlink6">Chardin (and maybe Tipler, even if I don't know if he have read him)
in the sense that he thinks life will evolve to higher stages, and
that space colonization is something ethically good and necessary. 

<p>
I would put him on the mystical side of transhumanism; not quite a
transhumanist, but with several points in common.</a>
