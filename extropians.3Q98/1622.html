<a name="1627qlink1">From: Damien Broderick &lt;damien@ariel.ucs.unimelb.edu.au&gt;
<br>
<a href="1619.html#1622qlink1">&gt;Unless Erik asked for his messages to be deleted, I'm appalled by this</a><br>
<i>&gt;news.  (On the other hand, I admit to a double standard here.  I would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;quite pleased to learn that certain racist posts had been expunged.)</i><br>

<p>
I'd like to add my disappointment to Damien's but without any reservation at
all.
</a>
<br>
I can't seem to find the post to which he reffered so perhaps Damien's
comments about selective deletion were in a proper context, but I'd have
deep reservations about even that.

<p>
I thought we had this all out on 'The Well' years ago ?  As I recall, it was
established that the proper ethics in these situations are that "You own
your own words".
<br>
Certainly a person has the right to delete all of their own contributions
(if that is an available option) but for someone else to do it is simply
vandalism.
