<p>
True. I said that two exact copies were exactly the same person, in the
example we had two similar copies and so two similar people.

<p>
<a href="2044.html#2079qlink2">&gt;But by this same criterion, you are not the same person that wrote</a><br>
<i>&gt;this post, and you weren't even 30 seconds later!</i><br>

<p>
Am I really and truly the same person I was 30 seconds ago, how many
angels can dance on the head of a pin? These are probably not useful
questions because they probably don't have meaningful answers. A more
interesting question is, do I want to do the same things I did 30
seconds ago, the answer is no, I already typed the beginning of this
sentence and don't want to do it again. Unless they are in identical
environments two copies will very soon want different things, for
example, one will want copy A to blow his brains out and the other one
will want copy B to do it.
