<p>
No, it needs to be _replaced_.

<p>
For non-commercial use, the Open Content license is a fairly good option.

<p>
But.

Any resolution of the essential problems of copyright needs to bear in 
mind several points.


<OL>
<a name="2606qlink1">  <li>  How to make arrangements for the recognition and remuneration of
   developers of new intellectual goods, while handling the essential 
   problem of copyright, which is that the cost of replicating information
   tends towards zero but the value of the information (and effort
   required to produce it) does not.</a>

  <li>  With respect to (1), how to authenticate the origin of a piece of
   information. (Libraries of record to accept email submissions?)

  <li>  How to prevent violations of any provisions of (1), without tending to
   damage the free flow of information within society, which is essential
   to our continuing development. (Consider the WIPO treaty as an example
   of throwing out the baby with the bathwater.)

  <li>  How to deal with the transition to the new system, assuming there is
   one. (For example, recent copyright treaty changes raised the length
   of copyright from "life plus fifty" to "life plus seventy"; a considerable
   amount of out-of-copyright work went back into copyright control, and I
   know at least one publisher who was seriosly inconvenienced by this.)

<a name="2606qlink2">If I had an answer to question (1), which is the big chestnut in this
fire, I'd be crowing it from the rooftops. Unfortunately I don't, this
side of a nanotechnology revolution (which puts the _whole_ economy in
the same basket as intellectual property, thus completely changing the
ball game we're playing).

<p>
Any suggestions?
