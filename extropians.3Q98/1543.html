Given enough time, the SI would surely reach a state where it can
afford such luxuries. The thing is that it likely wouldn't have
enough time; it would be strong enough to stop the competition, but
likely not smart/powerful enough to do it gently. It's much easier to
destroy than to subdue, and with the hot breath of other ascending
forces (with undoubtedly similar intentions) in its neck, the choice
would be easy.

  <li>  I kiss the ground Tipler walks upon.
  <li>  If I was the SI, I would rather 'die' than think like that. If it's that 
removed from our framework, why not just wander off to another system while 
remaining in stasis.
  <li>  Nanotech is lowtech. Hitech is singularity construction, linear black 
holes, quantum engineering, whatever. Simultaneous communication with every 
single human being on Earth would not be a problem, for example. 
  <li>  Organic bodies are romantic, fun vessels. You're just prejudiced against 
them because they currently get old and wrinkled and have a use-by date. Once 
you adjust the sub-structure they're fun! Even 'old and wrinkled' can be fun. 
I predict the very young (12-25) look will be followed by the very old look. 
Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The 'aliens' know... and they 
don't ride around the stratosphere in silver spaceships yet...
