&gt; From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;<br>

<p>
<a href="2446.html#2448qlink1">&gt; One concept that I developed in my minds eye upon reading much of Vinge's</a><br>
<i>&gt; work is that a 'singularity' is not a destination, but the horizon of any</i><br>
<i>&gt; man's vision of the future. While extrapolating from Moore's Law we think</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the event horizon of the 'singularity' is going to come closer and</i><br>
<i>&gt; closer as we approach a given point that seems now to be incomprehensible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, given that amplification of our own intelligence is an effect of</i><br>
<i>&gt; approaching the singularity, our own ability to imagine future</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibilities should also expand with our own intelligence.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2446.html#2448qlink2">&gt; The singularity is ALWAYS in the future. It will NEVER be reached. </a><br>

<p>
If you consider the emergence of SI to be [the beginning of]
the Singularity, then it will be a real event at a certain (fixed) point
in time, for example 30 years from now. This is imo a more useful
definition.

<p>
<a href="2446.html#2448qlink3">&gt; For example, I and others on this list can imagine greater things in store</a><br>
<i>&gt; for humanity in the future than the average broom pusher or the average</i><br>
<i>&gt; tribal bushman. I am sure that to at least some humans on this planet, our</i><br>
<i>&gt; internet civilization we are building here is superhumanly</i><br>
<i>&gt; incomprehensible, while we would look at those people as savages, living a</i><br>
<i>&gt; near-animal existence. To them, we are already beyond the singularity</i><br>
<i>&gt; event horizon as they see it.</i><br>

<p>
Maybe, but we are all still the same species. Though there is a large knowledge
gap, we still share all the basic traits that make us human. The SIs on the
other hand will be like a completely alien life form.

<p>
<a href="2446.html#2448qlink4">&gt; Do not feel bad, though, as there will always be niches and reservations</a><br>
<i>&gt; and uses for individuals of all levels, just as there are niches for</i><br>
<i>&gt; savages within our own culture.</i><br>

<p>
Hmm, I'm not so sure.
