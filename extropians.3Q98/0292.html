it is only very similar.  That is, they are

<br>
that happen to differ only in location. 
They do differ, though.</a>

<p>
<a href="0264.html#0292qlink3">&gt;Similarly, if I replace all of your cells with cells which act just like</a><br>

<p>
<a name="0324qlink2"><a name="0312qlink2">I will agree with this.  There is no way to tell
</a>
the difference, if you are not aware that there
are really two different CDs.<a name="0312qlink3">  Of course, if the

then<a name="0318qlink7"> the first CD will never know it is "offline",
</a>
</a>
any more than other dead people know that
they are dead.
</a>

<p>
<a href="0264.html#0292qlink5">&gt;Since we can and do presume the existence of consciousness which we</a><br>
don't
<br>
<a href="0264.html#0292qlink6">&gt;feel based on observed behavior, and since the observed behavior would</a><br>
be
<br>
<a href="0264.html#0292qlink7">&gt;identical, we must conclude that the consciousness would be identical.</a><br>

<p>
Very similar, at least.
