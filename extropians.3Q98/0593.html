A very nice list, with a well thought-out set of subheadings.  I also 
agree with John Novak's suggestion that extended answers to the FAQs 
ought to be written.  This will help ensure that such a document 
gets taken more seriously.

<p>
Here are a few suggested modifications to Greg's list:

<p>
<a href="0587.html#0593qlink1">&gt; Yes.  As I grouped (and partially rephrased) them, the questions would look</a><br>
<i>&gt; like this:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSHUMANISM</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What is transhumanism?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What is a posthuman?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Transhumanism and Nature</i><br>

<p>
(This is, presumably, meant to be a separate section heading?)
 
<p>
<a href="0587.html#0593qlink2">&gt; Isn't transhumanism tampering with nature?</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?</i><br>

<p>
A possible additional spin on this type of question is whether 
transhumanism is environmentally sound, or if they might be dangerous:

<p>
Are transhumanist technologies environmentally sound?

<p>
Might transhuman technologies be dangerous?

<p>
This second question can be answered with specifics; many of the other 
FAQs deal with such specifics, which need not be reiterated in the 
answer. However, it can also be answered at the level of 
generalities: "Well, yes, transhuman technologies may be dangerous, 
just as cars, aeroplanes, and electrical power can be dangerous. 
However, ..."

<p>
<a href="0587.html#0593qlink3">&gt; TRANSHUMANISM AS A PHILOSOPHICAL AND CULTURAL VIEWPOINT</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What are transhumanism's philosophical and cultural antecedents, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and how is it distinguished from other, similar ideas?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What prominent thinkers are associated with transhumanism?</i><br>

<p>
I would like to reiterate a point that has dropped off this question: it 
is not at all the same as "Who is prominent within transhumanism?", 
although that is also an interesting question.

<p>
<i>&gt; Is transhumanism a cult/religion?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="0587.html#0593qlink4">&gt; Won't things like uploading, cryonics and AI fail because </a><br>
<i>&gt; they can't preserve or create the soul?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; LIFE EXTENSION</i><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why do you want to live longer?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Isn't death part of the natural order of things?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Won't extended life spans cause overpopulation problems?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; SOCIETY AND POLITICS</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Won't new technologies only benefit the rich and powerful? </i><br>
<i>&gt; What happens to the rest?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Shouldn't we concentrate on current problems like improving the</i><br>
<i>&gt; condition of the poor people or solving international conflicts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; instead of putting effort into foreseeing the "far" future?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What kind of society would posthumans live in?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Will these new technologies be used in war and might they cause </i><br>
<i>&gt; our extinction?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How will posthumans or superintelligent machines </i><br>
<i>&gt; treat humans who aren't augmented?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do transhumanists think technology will solve all problems?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; PRACTICALITIES AND THE TRANSHUMANIST PROGRAM</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What evidence is there that it will happen?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<a name="0597qlink1"><i>&gt; What is nanotechnology?</i><br>

</a><p>
What is artificial intelligence?

<p>
<a href="0587.html#0593qlink5">&gt; All these transhumanist issues will not happen within a hundred years;</a><br>
<i>&gt; won't they will take more like a thousand years. (MNT, Uploading)</i><br>

<p>
This is the sort of question which makes me think that more than one 
answer ought to be given to several of these FAQs.  Readers can decide 
for themselves which answer to take more seriously. Similarly for the 
next question:
  
<p>
<a href="0587.html#0593qlink6">&gt; What if it doesn't work?</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How could I become a posthuman?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Isn't the possibility of success (in cryonics) too small?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Will the people of the future be interested in restoring you?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What recent progress has been made towards transhumanist goals?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How can I become involved in transhumanism?</i><br>

<p>
A very nice set of questions.  Unfortunately, an FAQ has certain stylistic 
disadvantages over an essay; its disjointed form typically means that 
fewer people will read it all the way through than would read a 
well-written essay.  An essay inspired by the FAQ may be a useful 
project for inclusion in the transhumanist reader.
