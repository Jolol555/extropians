Not really, all you have to do is not associate with individuals and groups
that tend toward irrational violence and crime. In fact, your local
Neighborhood Watch group most likely has a series of handouts on personal
safety.

<a name="1033qlink1">I have friends of may different class, race, gender and sexual preferences
(including some S&amp;M fans) backgrounds. None of them however are prone to
irrational violence.

The key is to be able to select your friends and associates. If you don't
know about Section 8 housing you may want to look up some information about
it to see how your tax dollars are being used. Section 8 housing is one of
the best ways to spread out a criminal class into otherwise safe areas and
secure buildings.

Neal Stephenson wrote a good SF novel which included a number of these
ideas. Look up his book "The Diamond Age" It's a great read.
