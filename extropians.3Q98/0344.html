Abstract
<br>
  The Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat, serving as a spontaneously
  diabetic model with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
  (NIDDM), exhibits impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) at about 16 weeks of age.
  In this study, we investigated whether or not biotin, a
  water-soluble vitamin, improved the IGT of OLETF rats. To this end, we
  administered diets containing one of three levels of biotin,
  a high-biotin diet (BH), a normal-biotin
  diet (BN) and a basal-biotin diet (BB), to OLETF rats up to
  24 weeks of age. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed four
  times between 13 and 22 weeks of age. The administration of a BH corrected
  the IGT of OLETF rats. Upon further investigation, we found that insulin
  secretion in the OLETF-BH rats was decreased to a significant extent,
  signaling that the hyperinsulinemia typical to the OLETF-BH rats had clearly
  improved. Body weights were significantly lower in the OLETF-BH group than in
  the other OLETF groups, even though the OLETF-BH rats showed a significantly
  higher average daily food intake. The body weight gain of the OLETF-BH rats
  followed the same tendency as the control-LETO (Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka)
  rats (LETO-BB and LETO-BN). These results demonstrate that a high-level
  biotin diet can improve the glucose handicap in NIDDM rats.
