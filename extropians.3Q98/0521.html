Shit Max, did you have to write that? We already have a severe image
problem when it comes to these things</a> :-(

<i>&gt; a threat than a wimpy little gun ever will</a> be?</i><br>

<p>
Yes, good point. It is utterly absurd to think that technology and 
knowledge will eliminate war, suffering and evil. New technology
has *always* been used to make more powerful weapons, and intelligence
and benevolnence are not specifically linked, just as malice and
stupidity aren't specifically linked. Although future technologies
don't necessarily have to cause a full-flung armageddon (after all,
we still haven't used the nukes), there *will* be plenty of violence
around. Certainly if your ambitions include becoming a SI you'd
*better* be prepared to fight for it. After all, some of the meansest,
smartest and most power-hungry people on the planet will be after 
the same goal (and I don't think they want to share). 

<p>
<a href="0508.html#0521qlink3">&gt; &gt;Most Europeans doesn't have it and doesn't want it</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and don't se the gun debate as a problem at all because it doesn't exist and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;no one miss it.</i><br>

<p>
The gun debate may not/hardly exist around here (due to a brainwashed
consensus not unlike the one against (human)cloning -- all the same
paranoia, xenophobic, media-manipulated thing), but the *crime problem*
_does_ exist. By denying the problem, it won't go away. It's time to
toughen up those santctimonious, criminal-loving socialist laws, and
get tough on crime. Arming the law abiding citizens is one major
step in that direction, as are extensive surveillance networks and
(crucial) tough sentences, legalization of victimless crimes and a 
quick and efficient justice system.
 
<p>

<i>&gt; at least twice as high as America? </i><br>

<p>
Oh, that so? Must be the depressing weather...
