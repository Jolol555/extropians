I've always loved the idea of laser launch. 

<p>
The rule of thumb for the flight plan, BTW, used to be "thirty gees for
thirty seconds", so it's a bit of a hard ride. IIRC, that's something like
8-10 gees more than the *peak* gee load you get with modified military
launchers. Users had better think about that carefully.

<p>
The economics are complex, and (aren't they always?) fraught with politics.
Here's what I think:

<p>
The incremental cost per pound has every reason to be very low indeed. I
refuse to believe the lowest figures I've heard, but $100 per pound seems
possible, provided you amortize over a lot of launches, and there are no
surprise failures on the lasers, etc.

<p>
The frontend costs are significant (the laser array and the power source
for it: I seem to recall old work suggesting a dedicated nuclear power
reactor?).  

<p>
Expect some "resistance environmental"--the engine employs air-detonation,
which means NOx byproducts. If I remember right, the last little bit of
delta-vee takes boiling something off or out of the airframe, and that
means changing the beam so it focuses on the airframe somehow, but neither
loses track nor hits the wrong thing nor cooks your payload, all at maximum
distance through (mirage shimmering) air at maximum beam depression. 

<p>
The use of the ground station technology for other purposes such as
ballistic missile point defense should not be overlooked. Expect this to be
controversial in some circles.

<p>
Lastly, there are the usual caveats about government programs, bleeding
edge tech and technologists selling sweet dreams at low prices that never
show up.
