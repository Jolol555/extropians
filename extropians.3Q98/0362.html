<i>&gt;&gt; Oh. Right. And then you'll have to kill the executioner, of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; course.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Obviously not, because, as the name says, he's an *executioner*,</i><br>
<i>&gt;not a *murderer*. Murder = illegal killing, execution = *legal*</i><br>

<i>&gt;murderer kills "innocents", the executioner kills murderers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; the mode of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; punishment being so that it fits the crime.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Yeah, what the hell, we really had it sorted out in Old Testament</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; days, eh?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actually, this kind of justice goes a lot further back than the OT, </i><br>
and
<br>
<a href="0347.html#0362qlink2">&gt;yes, some things have a timeless value. I don't give a crap whether</a><br>

<i>&gt;Equal retribution is as fair as you can get with justice, other </i><br>
methods
<br>
<a href="0347.html#0362qlink3">&gt;are completey arbitrary.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; Justice is served "swift &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; sure", within weeks of the arrest.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; So you plan to spend an enormous amount of money on the judicial</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; system?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;On the contrary, without years of appeals it would be considerably</i><br>
<i>&gt;cheaper than the present justice systems. Furthermore, it would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;automated wherever possible to further increase speed and </i><br>
efficiency,
<br>
<i>&gt;and reduce costs. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
The ideal of swift and sure justice is wonderful - as long as it is 
also INFALLIBLE. Until that day arrives, I will be happy to pay taxes 
to support the present system of appeals and proof beyond a 
reasonable doubt before enacting any permanent punishment on anyone. 
In fact, here in Illinois, there have been several celebrated cases 
of prosecutors LYING to make political points off the condemned 
bodies of poor mopes who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
Perhaps capital punishment should be put off until the advent of 
perfect justice? Until the state can be absolutely sure of never 
condemming an innocent, they should not have the power of life and 
death.

<p>
A person defending himself has the supreme advantage of knowing that 
the person they are shooting is guilty of attempting a crime against 
person or property, and therefore is not constrained by the limits 
that shuold be placed on states.
