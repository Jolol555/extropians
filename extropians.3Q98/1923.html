<i>&gt;&gt;So how many neurons must be in different states</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't know, I strongly suspect a precise point does not exist</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the transition is gradual, but things without a precise</i><br>
<i>&gt;transition point can still be as different as day and night,</i><br>
<i>&gt;for example, the difference between day and night.</i><br>

<p>
True enough.

<p>
<a href="1893.html#1923qlink2">&gt;&gt;If *any* change is sufficient, then the person who inhabited</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;this body half a second ago is dead.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any change is not sufficient, a huge change is sufficient. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;difference between expecting to die any minute and not having</i><br>
<i>&gt;that experience is huge.</i><br>

<p>
I am not sure that it is.  I have been in situations (car
accidents, etc) where I thought I was about to die, and
I am not certain that I was appreciably different after
them, than I would have been had I not had that experience.

<p>
<a href="1893.html#1923qlink3">&gt;&gt;I certainly am not having the same thoughts now as</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I was an hour ago, yet am I not the same person?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is no one correct answer, it's a matter of opinion and</i><br>
<i>&gt;apparently the opinion of the Randall R Randall of right now is</i><br>
<i>&gt;that he is the same person he was an hour ago. Unfortunately</i><br>
<i>&gt;the much more important opinion of the Randall R Randall of an</i><br>
<i>&gt;hour from now on the subject is not available.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1952qlink3">To say that Randall-minus-an-hour's opinion is
better than mine, you must first *assume* that we
are not the same person.</a>  I would agree that if you
had a copy from an hour ago, it wouldn't be the
same person, but this seems to me to result purely
from the fact that there are observably *two* of the
person.

<p>
<a name="1952qlink1"><a href="1893.html#1923qlink4">&gt;Thought experiment: I made a copy of you an hour ago, one I let</a><br>
<i>&gt;go to live his normal life (it doesn't matter if it's</a> the copy or the</i><br>
<i>&gt;original), the other one I chain to a time bomb set to go off in</i><br>
<i>&gt;one hour. BANG. Were you that poor fellow who just got blown up?</i><br>

<p>
No, however...

<p>
<a href="1893.html#1923qlink5">&gt;If so then you must be able to tell us what it was like to be</a><br>
<i>&gt;chained to the bomb watching the clock slowly move to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;zero hour, but you can't, you know nothing about it.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1952qlink4">This leads to the conclusion that when people
have amnesia, someone *died*.</a>

<p>
<a name="1952qlink5">Just to clear things up, let me rephrase what
you seem to be saying:  Two perfectly identical
(at the neural level, anyway) people are not
two people, but one.  However, if they diverge
as much as a normal person changes in one
hour, the loss of that hour constitutes death (e.g.
if you kill one).</a>
