Well, I don't understand half of what you're saying here, but I've heard
similar things before. I disagree; it's not the simple algorithmic process
that you make it out to be here, it seems to be analagous to methods of
neural network training which inject random data into the network and
then wait for it to settle (I forget the technical term). So it's not
surprising that we end up with lots of memories of dreams that may or
may not have happened.

<p>
That said, I've had plenty of experience of lucid dreaming and that does
tend to point towards dreams having some real existence.
