I didn't mean "we" as in "every one of us", but in a more majoritarian

But I doubt they'll speak up and say so, so we probably won't know.

<p>
I'm willing to discuss this, but first let me plead for lots of 
tolerance in such discussions.  It is way too easy to interpret 
honest ideas and opinions as insults to a gender or some other subgroup.
(Sarah's sarcastic reply to Randy's suggestion of gender correlations 
in receptivity to radical ideas seems an example of this.)

<p>
Regarding nerds, I suspect a single term is used because there is in 
fact a strong correlation among various attributes.  And I suspect the 
term is used mostly for males both because those attributes aren't 
considered to be such negatives for females, and because men are more
likely to exibit those traits.  

<p>
I was once (and may still be) a nerd, and for me the essense of it is 
focusing on one's own feelings and ideas, relative to caring what other
people think.  I didn't care much how I looked, didn't care much about how 
others looked, and didn't much respect people who cared a lot.  The same 
went for sports, showing how strong or tough you are, showing dominance 
via insults and malicious gossip, getting along by agreeing with people, 
etc.  I got along fine with people who were like me, but others saw me as 
weak, easily dominated, unattractive, and socially ignorant.  They did
admit though that I was very capable regarding what I cared about: ideas.  

<p>
I've read, and my observations seem to confirm, that women are more 
inclined (either by genetics or socialization) to get along socially,
while men care more about being respected than being liked.  And women
seem to value strong socially dominant men more than men value these
traits in women.  Given these correlations, the "nerd" phenomena makes
sense to me.
