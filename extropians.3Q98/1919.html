<p>
No, I don't mean all conceivable experiences.<a name="1952qlink6">  Your mind is an
information processor.  Therefore, A universal Turing machine can
emulate your mind.</a>  If you were to make a graphical representation
<a name="1952qlink7">where every point in its space represented one and only one possible
state of that universal Turing machine you would have what I call the
"design space of all possible information processors".</a>  This is
regardless of whether that information processor was designed,
evolved, or just happen to drop out of the sky from a disordered blob
and accidentally self assemble into an SI.  I prefer to think of this
graph in terms of 3D.  In reality the graph would have to be assembled
such that the smallest of changes in the human mind would always be
associated with adjacent point plots.  I'm sure this would cause it to
end up being Nth dimentionnal with N being very large.  This concept
is not new to you. You recently wrote about Tipler's Omega creating a
copy of all possible minds.  Here its assumed that all possible minds
means those in the "the design space of all possible information
processors" that are compatible with the biological configuration of
the human mind. 

<p>
 All of your arguments so far seem to be exploiting the fact that
there is a fuzzy boundary around identity.  However, it doesn't follow
from that that you can just throw up your hands and give up the clear
difference between being inside and outside that boundary.  Yes the
transition between night and day is fuzzy, but I can say for sure that
between 11:00 am and 2:00 pm in my time zone it is always daytime.  To
be consistent with your method of debating in this thread I expect you
to come back with something about an eclipse.  From my perspective you
seem to be skirting the issues here.  My debate with you hinged on
your answer to the question posed in my modified thought experiment. 
In your response to that post that part of it was just conveniently
omitted.  So I'll ask it again:

<p>
My original thought experiment:
<br>
&lt;&lt;
<br>
<a name="1952qlink8">You've just completed 10 hours of mundane work at the office today in
your normal biological state.  You then documented your work more
thoroughlly than ever before.  A doctor shows up and completely
convinces you beyond any shadow of a doubt that he has invented a
flash light type device that can induce a perfect 10 hour amnesia with
no side effects [or pain]whatsoever.  You are 100% convinced this is
safe and effective.</a>  He offers you $10,000 to let him use the device
on you.
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>

<p>
John Clarks response was:

<p>
<a href="1716.html#1919qlink2">&gt; As you say it's a judgment call but I'd tell him no way.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
I can accept this answer as honest, especially if you are a
multi-millionaire.  So I modified the thought experiment to more
accurately reflect the situation in the original spawning of 1000
copies. I wrote:

<p>
My modified thought experiment:
<br>
&lt;&lt;
<br>
Okay, then how about if he said he found out that your wealth had been
divided by 1000 because of some unfortunate events in the U.S. economy
today.  And that your family and friends will welcome your
interactions with them 1000 times less.  This includes your friends on
the Extropian and Transhuman lists.  And then he continued to list
many more unfortunate things that happened to you today.  Then he
says, "but I can fix it all if you just let me use the device on you".
 Would you do it if all this was true?
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>

<p>
This question was conveniently omitted from your reply.  Your answer
is key to this debate.

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
I agree with your comments above.  I was pressured into inventing a
definition by John Novak so I did the best I could with a first cut at
it.  This definition however is not key to my debate with you.  Its
for the reasons you mention above that I have been sticking with
examples and thought experiments whenever possible.  If I were so
inclined, I'm sure my best definition of identity would be no less the
size of a book - complete with a multitude of examples and thought
experiments.
