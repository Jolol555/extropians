<i>&gt; </i><br>

bearing arms would probably also help.

<p>
<i>&gt; The</i><br>
<a href="2155.html#2163qlink2">&gt; neatest detail is that the ticket machines have been placed along the side</a><br>
<i>&gt; of the tram (so that users must stand side-on to the forward motion of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; often-jolting tram) and right next to the well of the central egress,</i><br>
<i>&gt; causing off-balance old patrons and baby-clutching mothers to tumble to</i><br>
<i>&gt; their doom as they try to key in their choice of ticket and feed in their</i><br>
<i>&gt; coins with one hand.  Technology cannot defeat stupidity.  </i><br>

<p>
But it can reduce its negative effects. The good thing with technology is
that a well-designed system is much more reliable than humans, which
have never been designed for monotonous, robot-like tasks. People have
mood swings, personal agendas, they can get sick, feel frustrated with
their job (and take it out on the customers), can't work 24h a day, 7 days
a week (without quickly breaking down), they can go on strike, come late to
work etc. A machine simply does what it's programmed to do. Its lack
of flexibility (a flaw that can be largely compensated by smart design)
is only a relatively minor problem compared to its many advantages. 

<p>
<a href="2155.html#2163qlink3">&gt; (And of course,</a><br>
<i>&gt; without the human conductors roaming up and down the tram and catching</i><br>
<i>&gt; their eye, most travellers simply avoid buying or validating their tickets;</i><br>
<i>&gt; tragedy of the commons, again.  There is a squad of inspectors, but as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; kid told me the other day, `There's heaps of strategies'...)</i><br>

<p>
Smarter machine design, ubiquitous surveillance and a firm justice
system would ensure that only a handful of "supercriminals" could
get away with it. The rest would either start to behave or go to jail
....which would mean that the cops could soon focus all their attention
on the few remaining bad guys, and deal with them. This effect would
be further enhanced by the legalization of victimless crime, which
means there would be a lot less criminals to begin with. It may sound
"statist" or "cynical" to some, but at least it would actually work. And,
last but not least, it would honor the rational principles of maximal
personal freedom and responsibility for one's actions.
