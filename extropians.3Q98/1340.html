After skimming this thread I am grateful not to have been on the 
Internet this weekend.  I would, however, like to make one suggestion.  

<p>
<a name="1383qlink1">For those you who are interested in a future gender balance within 
extropianism or within transhumanism,<a name="1346qlink1"> PLEASE LISTEN to this.  You have 
GOT to STOP singling out females as (1) a goal for recruitment, (2) 
</a>
fodder for cyberbabe fantasies and (3) expectations of mating.  We just 
<a name="1383qlink2">want to show up and interact intellectually like the men get to do.  If 
we do not get to interact intellectually, if we are constant targets 
for special attention,</a> comeons, and retaliation after we 'reject' you, 
then we are going to walk.</a>

<p>
<a name="1346qlink2">This behavior has driven women out of here before,</a> and it has driven me 
out.  There has been too much of it over the past two years, and I 
think that you guys need to think long and hard about how you treat 
young women within your ranks.  I am asking you to do this 
as a friend, as someone who continues to support the goals of ExI, but 
who simply cannot live with the stress any longer.  It 
takes away energy that should be going to important transhumanist 
projects, which is going to my full focus from now on.  Anyone who 
wants to work with me is welcome--if you are looking for a different 
kind of attention, you need to back off.

<p>
Take care,
<br>
Kathryn Aegis
