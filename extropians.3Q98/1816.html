<i>&gt;10 humans and nothing else. A B universe contains 10 humans and one </i><br>
<i>&gt;trillion trillion stones. There is a small C universe (of negligible </i><br>
<i>&gt;size), and it spawns one thousand baby-univeses through a random </i><br>
<i>&gt;process (like rolling fair dice) that has a 10% chance of yielding an </i><br>
<i>&gt;A and 90% of a B.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It seems clear that there will probably be about 100 A univeses and </i><br>
<i>&gt;900 B universes. But that means about 90% of all humans will find </i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves in an B universe. So if all you knew was the set-up and </i><br>
<i>&gt;that you were a human, then you should believe that there was a </i><br>
<i>&gt;90% chance that you were in an B universe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And yet, if you include stones in the reference class, then it seems </i><br>
<i>&gt;you should believe you are in an A universe. For if you are in a B </i><br>
<i>&gt;universe, then there exists in total at least one trillion trillion </i><br>
<i>&gt;stones and then you would probably have been one of these stones </i><br>
<i>&gt;rather than a human.</a></i><br>

<p>
Let N = "trillion trillion", and assume there are exactly 100 A 
"universes" and 900 B "universes".  Note that these are *not* "universes" 
in the sense I was using of "possible worlds."<a name="1824qlink2"> The entire construction 
of C + 100 As + 900 Bs is just one total space-time, a "possible world."  

<p>
As described the only remaining uncertainty is where in this world I am.  
If I treat stone slots and human slots equally, there are 
100*10 + 900(10+N) slots.  If my prior is uniform across these slots,</a> 
<a name="1824qlink3">then conditioning on my being in a human slot, there is a 90% chance I'm 
in a B "universe," as you prefer.</a>

<p>
<a name="1824qlink4"><a href="1814.html#1816qlink2">&gt;&gt; &gt;Similarly, I would say that finding that you are an observer does not</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;give you reason for thinking that a large fraction of all slots in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;the universe is occupied by observers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Your error is to say "large fraction."  The fact that life exists</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; on Earth *does* make it more likely that our universe has other planets</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; where life has evolved in a similar time.  It just isn't enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; conclude the fraction of Earth-like planets with life is "large."</i><br>
<i>&gt;...</i><br>
<i>&gt;And now you say that finding that life exists on Earth should </i><br>
<i>&gt;not affect your beliefs about about the fraction of Earth-like </i><br>
<i>&gt;planets with life.</i><br>

<p>
But I said exactly the opposite in the quote above!</a>
