All ham transmissions are required to be in clear, or in encoding 
that is easily decoded by anyone who cares to listen in. Any use of 
the ham bands for commercial purposes, or in some countries, to allow 
third parties who are not licensed, is prohibited. In the US, it's 
also illegal to use the radio to avoid a long distance phone call if 
the long distance is right there and useable. Kind of takes all the 
reason out of becoming a ham, in my book - but that part of the law 
is mostly ignored by hams and rarely enforced by Uncle Charlie..

<p>

<a href="0363.html#0390qlink7">&gt;You talked about spread-spectrum cellular, which sounds very </a><br>
interesting.

<p>
If you can afford it, space on commercial launch vehicles is just 
around the corner. If your satellites get annoying to Uncle, he may 
want to test out his shiny new Star Wars laser you just paid for with 
your taxes, though..Most likely you will need to get SOME 
government's permission to put anything into orbit through legal 
means.

<p>
If the Soviets could get Sputnik into orbit in 1957 using 1940's 
tech, it's conceivable that some suitably encouraged private parties 
could at present throw together a LEO launch vehicle and get it up 
without governmental interference..
