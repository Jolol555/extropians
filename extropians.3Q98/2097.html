I have the promotional booklet and my recall of the review was that I would
watch the film given the opportunity. However when the opportunity arrived I had
better things to do.

Are you fumbling again? Did you mistype 1966 for 1996? For what it's worth I too
grimace at my mistakes but don't normally tell people that I am autistic and
suffer dyslexia or that I grew up as a creole wasp speaking in sort of a
bastardized quebecois. However, I heeded your advice and yesterday read George
Orwell's "Politics and the English Language" taking to heart his critique on
vagueness.
