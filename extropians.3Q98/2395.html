<i>&gt; VIRTUAL SI</i><br>

<a href="2391.html#2395qlink1">&gt; Are we SIs? This question might seem silly but I'm serious. To answer</a><br>
this
<br>
<a href="2391.html#2395qlink2">&gt; question we need a definition of intelligence. Not being a cognitive</a><br>
expert,
<br>
<a href="2391.html#2395qlink3">&gt; I attempted to find this definition. Unfortunately, there seems to be a</a><br>
lack 
<br>
<a href="2391.html#2395qlink4">&gt; of consensus. I'll struggle through this question anyway hoping the</a><br>
cognition
<br>
<a href="2391.html#2395qlink5">&gt; cogniscienti will supplement and revise my comments where necessary.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nick Bostrom defined superintelligence in his paper "How Long Before </i><br>
<i>&gt; Superintelligence?" at <a href="http://www.hedweb.com/nickb/superintelligence.htm">http://www.hedweb.com/nickb/superintelligence.htm</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; thusly:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    By a "superintelligence" we mean an intellect that is much smarter</i><br>
<i>&gt;    than the best human brains in practically every field, including </i><br>
<i>&gt;    scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.</i><br>


<p>
Quite possibly this 'superintelligence' will not be found on the individual
level. To reach SI a comunity of HI or &lt;HI will have to combine efforts and
ideas; thus many humans come together to create a single
Superintelligence - a society.  This is what the present scientific
community is working towards now... many individual efforts trying to reach
similar
<br>
goals... working together.   I believe the main differences between an
optimal
<br>
society  and our present one are:


<OL>
  <li>  The individuals who make up the whole need to increase there own 
    mental capacity in such areas as memory retention, open mindedness,
    learning efficiency.

  <li>  Communication between the individuals is what enables the society to
    become efficient.  To maximise this there needs to be a better way to 
    relay information.  Not just from desktop to desktop, but from mind to 
    mind.  We need to devise a way to pass on our thoughts and ideas other 
    then our 5 senses.  Everyone percieves their own reality; not until
    it is possible to percieve someone elses reality will it be possible to


</OL>
<p>
    understand fully the thoughts and ideas of others.   It is more then
walking a mile in another's shoes.  Possibly uploading is the answer....  I
personally do not know.

<p>
I am sure there are more ways to become closer to Superintelligence -
possibly in the form of a society - and I am sure there are some solutions
to the
<br>
above differences between Super and Present Intelligence, so good luck and
maybe 
<br>
one day we will have all the answers - but that would be no fun.
