2.  generally rockets have a high l/d problem: they are tall and skinny, in order

to
<br>
<a name="1479qlink5">reduce atmospheric drag.  so, there is a great deal of science in the structural

<a name="1479qlink6">dynamics of the system.  this was a major problem in the early days of
rocketry.

others not.  i have only recently come to appreciate this.  the beauty of the

the

moving parts.

<p>
like apple computer, the roton concept is not really being sold right, in my
opinion.
<br>
when the rotoners say that it might raise payload at 1/5 the cost of conventional

<a name="1479qlink11">rockets, they should perhaps make it clear that what is meant is a system that
