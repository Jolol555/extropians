This should send drug warriors into conniption fits,
THC (the active chemical in cannabis) is found to 
be a brain-damage- preventing  antioxidant. Antioxidants
 extend the life of cells. As a National 
Academy of Sciences publication just reported:

<p>
 "Cannabidiol and THC also were shown to prevent 
 hydroperoxide-induced oxidative damage as well 
 as or better than other antioxidants..."

<p>
Here's the abstract of these research findings:

are neuroprotective antioxidants

The neuroprotective actions of cannabidiol and other 
cannabinoids were examined in rat cortical neuron cultures 
exposed to toxic levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter 
glutamate. Glutamate toxicity was reduced by both cannabidiol, 
a nonpsychoactive constituent of marijuana, and the 
psychotropic cannabinoid (delta)9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). 

<p>
Cannabinoids protected equally well against neurotoxicity 
mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, 2-amino-3-
(4-butyl-3-hydroxyisoxazol-5-yl)propionic acid receptors, 
or kainate receptors. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-induced 
toxicity has been shown to be calcium dependent; this study 
demonstrates that 2-amino-3-(4-butyl-3-hydroxyisoxazol-5-yl)
propionic acid/kainate receptor-type neurotoxicity is also 
calcium-dependent, partly mediated by voltage sensitive 
calcium channels. 

<p>
The neuroprotection observed with cannabidiol and THC was 
unaffected by cannabinoid receptor antagonist, indicating 
it to be cannabinoid receptor independent. Previous studies 
have shown that glutamate toxicity may be prevented by 
antioxidants. Cannabidiol, THC and several synthetic 
cannabinoids all were demonstrated to be antioxidants by 
cyclic voltametry. Cannabidiol and THC also were shown to 
prevent hydroperoxide-induced oxidative damage as well as 
or better than other antioxidants in a chemical (Fenton 
reaction) system and neuronal cultures. Cannabidiol was 
more protective against glutamate neurotoxicity than 
either ascorbate or -tocopherol, indicating it to be a 
potent antioxidant. These data also suggest that the 
naturally occurring, nonpsychotropic cannabinoid, 
cannabidiol, may be a potentially useful therapeutic 
agent for the treatment of oxidative neurological 
disorders such as cerebral ischemia.
