<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Researchers Find Sad, Lonely World in Cyberspace</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          By AMY HARMON</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;             n the first concentrated study of the social and psychological</i><br>
<i>&gt;effects of Internet use at home,</i><br>
<i>&gt;             researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have found that</i><br>
<i>&gt;people who spend even a few hours</i><br>
<i>&gt;          a week online experience higher levels of depression and</i><br>
<i>&gt;loneliness than they would have if they</i><br>
<i>&gt;          used the computer network less frequently.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Those participants who were lonelier and more depressed at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;start of the two-year study, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;          determined by a standard questionnaire administered to all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;subjects, were not more likely to use</i><br>
<i>&gt;          the Internet. Instead, Internet use itself appeared to cause a</i><br>
<i>&gt;decline in psychological well-being, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;          researchers said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                     The results of the $1.5 million</i><br>
<i>&gt;project ran completely contrary</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                     to expectations of the social</i><br>
<i>&gt;scientists who designed it and to</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                     many of the organizations that</i><br>
<i>&gt;financed the study. These</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                     included technology companies like</i><br>
<i>&gt;Intel Corp., Hewlett</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                     Packard, AT&amp;T Research and Apple</i><br>
<i>&gt;Computer, as well as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                     National Science Foundation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          "We were shocked by the findings, because they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;counterintuitive to what we know about how</i><br>
<i>&gt;          socially the Internet is being used," said Robert Kraut, a social</i><br>
<i>&gt;psychology professor at Carnegie</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Mellon's Human Computer Interaction Institute. "We are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;talking here about the extremes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          These were normal adults and their families, and on average, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;those who used the Internet most,</i><br>
<i>&gt;          things got worse."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          The Internet has been praised as superior to television and other</i><br>
<i>&gt;"passive" media because it allows</i><br>
<i>&gt;          users to choose the kind of information they want to receive, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;often, to respond actively to it in</i><br>
<i>&gt;          the form of e-mail exchanges with other users, chat rooms or</i><br>
<i>&gt;electronic bulletin board postings.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Research on the effects of watching television indicates that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;tends to reduce social involvement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          But the new study, titled "HomeNet," suggests that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;interactive medium may be no more socially</i><br>
<i>&gt;          healthy than older mass media. It also raises troubling questions</i><br>
<i>&gt;about the nature of "virtual"</i><br>
<i>&gt;          communication and the disembodied relationships that are often</i><br>
<i>&gt;formed in the vacuum of</i><br>
<i>&gt;          cyberspace.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Participants in the study used inherently social features like</i><br>
<i>&gt;e-mail and Internet chat more than they</i><br>
<i>&gt;          used passive information gathering like reading or watching</i><br>
<i>&gt;videos. But they reported a decline in</i><br>
<i>&gt;          interaction with family members and a reduction in their circles</i><br>
<i>&gt;of friends that directly corresponded</i><br>
<i>&gt;          to the amount of time they spent online.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          At the beginning and end of the two-year study, the subjects were</i><br>
<i>&gt;asked to agree or disagree with</i><br>
<i>&gt;          statements like "I felt everything I did was an effort," and "I</i><br>
<i>&gt;enjoyed life" and "I can find</i><br>
<i>&gt;          companionship when I want it." They were also asked to estimate</i><br>
<i>&gt;how many minutes each day they</i><br>
<i>&gt;          spent with each member of their family and to quantify their</i><br>
<i>&gt;social circle. Many of these are</i><br>
<i>&gt;          standard questions in tests used to determine psychological health.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          For the duration of the study, the subjects' use of the Internet</i><br>
<i>&gt;was recorded. For the purposes of</i><br>
<i>&gt;          this study, depression and loneliness were measured</i><br>
<i>&gt;independently, and each subject was rated on</i><br>
<i>&gt;          a subjective scale. In measuring depression, the responses were</i><br>
<i>&gt;plotted on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0</i><br>
<i>&gt;          being the least depressed and 3 being the most depressed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Loneliness was plotted on a scale of 1</i><br>
<i>&gt;          to 5.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          By the end of the study, the researchers found that one hour a</i><br>
<i>&gt;week on the Internet led, on</i><br>
<i>&gt;          average, to an increase of .03, or 1 percent, on the depression</i><br>
<i>&gt;scale, a loss of 2.7 members of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;          subject's social circle, which averaged 66 people, and an</i><br>
<i>&gt;increase of .02, or four-tenths of 1</i><br>
<i>&gt;          percent, on the loneliness scale.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          The subjects exhibited wide variations in all three measured</i><br>
<i>&gt;effects, and while the net effects were</i><br>
<i>&gt;          not large, they were statistically significant in demonstrating</i><br>
<i>&gt;deterioration of social and psychological</i><br>
<i>&gt;          life, Kraut said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Based on these data, the researchers hypothesize that relationships</i><br>
<i>&gt;          maintained over long distances without face-to-face contact</i><br>
<i>&gt;ultimately do</i><br>
<i>&gt;          not provide the kind of support and reciprocity that typically</i><br>
<i>&gt;contribute to</i><br>
<i>&gt;          a sense of psychological security and happiness, like being</i><br>
<i>&gt;available to</i><br>
<i>&gt;          baby-sit in a pinch for a friend, or to grab a cup of coffee.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          "Our hypothesis is there are more cases where you're building</i><br>
<i>&gt;shallow relationships, leading to an</i><br>
<i>&gt;          overall decline in feeling of connection to other people," Kraut</i><br>
<i>&gt;said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          The study tracked the behavior of 169 participants in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Pittsburgh area who were selected from</i><br>
<i>&gt;          four schools and community groups. Half the group was measured</i><br>
<i>&gt;through two years of Internet</i><br>
<i>&gt;          use, and the other half for one year. The findings will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;published this week by The American</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Psychologist, the peer-reviewed monthly journal of the American</i><br>
<i>&gt;Psychological Association.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Because the study participants were not randomly selected, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;unclear how the findings apply to</i><br>
<i>&gt;          the general population. It is also conceivable that some</i><br>
<i>&gt;unmeasured factor caused simultaneous</i><br>
<i>&gt;          increases in use of the Internet and decline in normal levels of</i><br>
<i>&gt;social involvement. Moreover, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;          effect of Internet use varied depending on an individual's life</i><br>
<i>&gt;patterns and type of use. Researchers</i><br>
<i>&gt;          said that people who were isolated because of their geography or</i><br>
<i>&gt;work shifts might have benefited</i><br>
<i>&gt;          socially from Internet use.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Even so, several social scientists familiar with the study</i><br>
<i>&gt;vouched for its credibility and predicted that</i><br>
<i>&gt;          the findings would probably touch off a national debate over how</i><br>
<i>&gt;public policy on the Internet</i><br>
<i>&gt;          should evolve and how the technology itself might be shaped to</i><br>
<i>&gt;yield more beneficial effects.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          "They did an extremely careful scientific study, and it's not a</i><br>
<i>&gt;result that's easily ignored," said Tora</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Bikson, a senior scientist at Rand, the research institution.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Based in part on previous studies that</i><br>
<i>&gt;          focused on how local communities like Santa Monica, Calif., used</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer networks to enhance</i><br>
<i>&gt;          civic participation, Rand has recommended that the federal</i><br>
<i>&gt;government provide e-mail access to all</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Americans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          "It's not clear what the underlying psychological explanation</i><br>
<i>&gt;is," Ms. Bikson said of the study. "Is it</i><br>
<i>&gt;          because people give up day-to-day contact and then find</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves depressed? Or are they</i><br>
<i>&gt;          exposed to the broader world of Internet and then wonder, 'What</i><br>
<i>&gt;am I doing here in Pittsburgh?'</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Maybe your comparison standard changes. I'd like to see this</i><br>
<i>&gt;replicated on a larger scale. Then I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt;          really worry."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Christine Riley, a psychologist at Intel Corp., the giant chip</i><br>
<i>&gt;manufacturer that was among the</i><br>
<i>&gt;          sponsors of the study, said she was surprised by the results but</i><br>
<i>&gt;did not consider the research</i><br>
<i>&gt;          definitive.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          "For us, the point is there was really no information on this</i><br>
<i>&gt;before," Ms. Riley said. "But it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;          important to remember this is not about the technology, per se;</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's about how it is used. It really</i><br>
<i>&gt;          points to the need for considering social factors in terms of how</i><br>
<i>&gt;you design applications and</i><br>
<i>&gt;          services for technology."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          The Carnegie Mellon team -- which included Sara Kiesler, a social</i><br>
<i>&gt;psychologist who helped</i><br>
<i>&gt;          pioneer the study of human interaction over computer networks;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tridas Mukophadhyay, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;          professor at the graduate business school who has examined</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer mediated communication in</i><br>
<i>&gt;          the workplace; and William Scherlis, a research scientist in</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer science -- stressed that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;          negative effects of Internet use that they found were not</i><br>
<i>&gt;inevitable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          For example, the main focus of Internet use in schools has been</i><br>
<i>&gt;gathering information and getting in</i><br>
<i>&gt;          touch with people from far-away places. But the research suggests</i><br>
<i>&gt;that maintaining social ties with</i><br>
<i>&gt;          people in close physical proximity could be more psychologically</i><br>
<i>&gt;healthy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          "More intense development and deployment of services that support</i><br>
<i>&gt;pre-existing communities and</i><br>
<i>&gt;          strong relationships should be encouraged," the researchers write</i><br>
<i>&gt;in their forthcoming article.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          "Government efforts to wire the nation's schools, for example,</i><br>
<i>&gt;should consider online homework</i><br>
<i>&gt;          sessions for students rather than just online reference works."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          At a time when Internet use is expanding rapidly -- nearly 70</i><br>
<i>&gt;million adult Americans are on line,</i><br>
<i>&gt;          according to Nielsen Media Research -- social critics say the</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology could exacerbate the</i><br>
<i>&gt;          fragmentation of U.S. society or help to fuse it, depending on</i><br>
<i>&gt;how it is used.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          "There are two things the Internet can turn out to be, and we</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't know yet which it's going to be,"</i><br>
<i>&gt;          said Robert Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard University</i><br>
<i>&gt;whose forthcoming book, "Bowling</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Alone," which is to be published next year by Simon &amp; Schuster,</i><br>
<i>&gt;chronicles the alienation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Americans from each other since the 1960s. "The fact that I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;able to communicate daily with my</i><br>
<i>&gt;          collaborators in Germany and Japan makes me more efficient, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;there are a lot of things it can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;          do, like bring me chicken soup."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Putnam added, "The question is how can you push computer mediated</i><br>
<i>&gt;communication in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;          direction that would make it more community friendly."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Perhaps paradoxically, several participants in the Internet study</i><br>
<i>&gt;expressed surprise when they were</i><br>
<i>&gt;          informed of the study's conclusions by a reporter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          "For me it's been the opposite of depression; it's been a way of</i><br>
<i>&gt;being connected," said Rabbi Alvin</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Berkun, who used the Internet for a few hours a week to read The</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jerusalem Post and</i><br>
<i>&gt;          communicate with other rabbis across the country.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          But Berkun said his wife did not share his enthusiasm for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;medium. "She does sometimes resent</i><br>
<i>&gt;          when I go and hook up," he said, adding after a pause, "I guess I</i><br>
<i>&gt;am away from where my family is</i><br>
<i>&gt;          while I'm on the computer." Another possibility is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;natural human preference for face-to-face</i><br>
<i>&gt;          communication may provide a self-correcting mechanism to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology that tries to cross it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          The rabbi's daughter, Rebecca, 17, said she had spent a fair</i><br>
<i>&gt;amount of time in teen-age chat rooms</i><br>
<i>&gt;          at the beginning of the survey in 1995.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          "I can see how people would get depressed," Ms. Berkun said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;"When we first got it, I would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;          on for an hour a day or more. But I found it was the same type of</i><br>
<i>&gt;people, the same type of things</i><br>
<i>&gt;          being said. It got kind of old."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
