What I do know is that with other people, if their brains are damaged or
altered in some way, this changes their behaviour which appears to me as
an alteration of their consciousness. Ergo, consciousness is attached in
some significant way to their brains. This is also consistent with my
own experience, albeit less drastically. Reading Oliver Sacks book
"The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat" is also very consistent</a> with
this.
