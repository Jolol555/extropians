Abstract
<br>
  Over 35 years, data and knowledge have internationally evolved from
  biochemical, biomedical and clinical research on vitamin Q10 (coenzyme Q10;
  CoQ10) and cancer, which led in 1993 to overt complete
  regression of the tumors in two cases of breast
  cancer. Continuing this research, three additional
  breast cancer patients also underwent a
  conventional protocol of therapy which included a daily oral
  dosage of 390 mg of vitamin Q10 (Bio-Quinone of Pharma Nord) during the
  complete trials over 3-5 years. The numerous metastases in the liver of a
  44-year-old patient "disappeared," and no signs of metastases were found
  elsewhere. A 49-year-old patient, on a dosage of 390 mg of vitamin Q10,
  revealed no signs of tumor in the pleural cavity after six months, and her
  condition was excellent. A 75-year-old patient with carcinoma in one
  breast, after lumpectomy and 390 mg of CoQ10, showed no
  cancer in the tumor bed or metastases. Control blood levels
  of CoQ10 of 0.83-0.97 and of 0.62 micrograms/ml increased to 3.34-3.64 and to
  3.77 micrograms/ml, respectively, on therapy with CoQ10 for
  patients A-MRH and EEL.
