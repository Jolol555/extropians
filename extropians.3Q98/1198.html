<a name="1204qlink1">It seems to me that there is at least one striking difference worth 
naming, between systems which have been designed and understood from the 
ground up, and evolved systems which we have tweaked and adapted to our
purposes.  Cars vs. Cows.</a>  

<p>
<a name="1204qlink2">While larger systems may contain subsystems of both types, I expect 
limitations on the granularity of integration, exactly because our 
limited understanding of evolved systems limits our flexibility in 
interfacing them with other systems.  Maybe all we really want out of 
cows are certain chemical processes in their stomaches, but cow systems
are hard to disentangle, so we'll leave them as units for some time to
</a>come.

I recall Drexler having written about this issue regarding nanotech.
