<p>
But how would we make up our collective mind?  If you follow Minsky's Society
of Mind concept, or Hofstadter's idealet research, the mind looks like a bunch
of competing entities and processes competing for time and passing in and out
of existence.  Very economic.

<p>
Hybridization might reduce some of the potential for cheating.  Given our
capacity for self-delusion, I doubt it would eliminate it.

<p>
Various elements competing for scarce resources over time.  Firms in the
economy, alleles in the gene pool.  Hofstadter says he modeled his research on
simulated annealing, which provides a connection to thermodynamics, but I
always think quasi-Darwinian would also describe it.  Idealets are generated
at random; ones which seem to help solve the problem get more time and get to
spawn more idealets, and eventually they can hook up to form an extended
process.

<p>
And the more I learn of them and their history, the more economics and
evolutionary biology seem to be the same theory applied to two different
fields.
