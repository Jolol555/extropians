So (approximately) does the shuttle, and some other launch vehicles; and

Roton claims 7,000lbs payload for a &lt;400,000lb launch mass, say 55:1. The
shuttle's what, 2000 tons with a 30 ton payload? 70:1?

<a name="1672qlink4">Uh, Roton, Skylon, Kistler's SSTO design before they canned it, etc, etc.
</a>
I don't know of any SSTO outside the government that's not supposed to be
operational very quickly. As far as I'm aware the first Roton is supposed
to carry 7,000lbs to orbit after initial testing.

<p>
<i>&gt; This is welfare for aerospace contractors. </i><br>

<p>
Uh, this is private funding for companies building spacecraft.

<p>
<i>&gt; Contrast that to the 30:1 mass </i><br>

<i>&gt; booster made of maraging steel. </i><br>

<p>
3% if the design works. Or 0.3% when you consider that you can't put more 
than one satellite on top in case it blows up. Compared to around 2% if 
Roton works, and no staging or recovery to pay for.

<p>
<i>&gt;Gary Hudson did.  He advocated it for years in an SSTO booster.</i><br>

<p>
In that case he isn't as smart as I thought, though that may have been back
in the days when there weren't as many alternatives.

<p>
Uh, which one? The only such proposal I know of was Black Horse, 
which transferred hydrogen peroxide in, you guessed it, steady, level 
subsonic flight.
