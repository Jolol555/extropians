Abstract
<br>
  When given as a supplement to an energy restricted diet the sympathomimetic
  agent ephedrine, in combination with methylxanthines such as
  caffeine, improves fat loss by dual actions: a central
  suppression of appetite and peripheral stimulation of energy expenditure
  covered by fat oxidation. Mean weight loss was found to be 16.6 kg after 6
  months when E+C was given as an adjuvant to an efficient hypoenergetic diet,
  which was 3.4 kg higher than in the placebo group. An additional 24 weeks
  treatment with E+C prevented relapse. In the first weeks of treatment E+C
  offset the hypotensive effect of energy restriction and weight loss, but the
  effect was transient, and after 8 weeks blood pressures were
  indistinguishable from those of the placebo group. E+C has no adverse effect
  on glucose and lipid metabolism, but has been shown to prevent the decline in
  HDL-cholesterol caused by weight loss. In a comparative trial the weight loss
  produced by E+C was similar to that of dexfenfluramine. More research on
  sympathomimetics and methylxanthines should be carried out to identify
  combinations with improved efficiency and safety. Moreover, more long-term
  trials and studies in males are required. [References: 12]
