OK. Not intentional. My writing style tends to depend on what I've been

reading recently.

<p>
<a href="1421.html#1429qlink2">&gt;Actually I'd say that making a joke to avoid dealing with an issue -- as</a><br>

<p>
I think this agrees with my point: Americans tend not to use irony as do
people in the UK. In the US it is seen as you describe it, a joke to avoid
the issue; in the UK, irony and satire have a strong history of being used
to emphasize the importance of issues, and to draw attention to them
without in any way detracting from their 'reality'.

<p>

<p>
I would hope that most of the people here are smarter than that, and
realise that generalizations are often used to mask the complexity of
issues and to gloss over the mutability of the underlying truths about
which they claim to speak authoritatively.

<p>
Curiously, though, I don't think you and I disagree about anything of
importance, do we?
