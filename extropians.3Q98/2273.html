<i>&gt; One is to have job applicants include with their resumes a small bet about</i><br>

<p>
I like this suggestion.  We do have analogues though.  People have long 
used costly signals to indicate their interest.  They use fancy paper, send
things via FEDEX, make phone calls, show up in person, or include cover 
letters that indicate substantial research learning about the company.  All
of these signal that one hasn't done the same thing for thousands of other
firms.  But bets would be less wasteful, and more tunable.

<p>
<a name="2392qlink1"><a href="2268.html#2273qlink2">&gt; The other is to have employers routinely provide public evaluations</a><br>

<i>&gt;clear-cut lies in the evaluations.</i><br>

<p>
It's not clear elminating lawsuits gives employers an incentive to be honest.</a>
