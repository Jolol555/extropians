&lt;Try re-reading what I said: "if AI is hard and uploads are easy then most
future life will originate from uploaded humans." That means that any
number of SIs can be created from a limited number of organic humans, and
all will remember being an organic human at some point. In order to get
to be an SI they must have started out as a human, but any number of SIs
can be created from one human.&gt;

<p>
Even from an extremely conservative viewpoint, there is certainly the ability 
to boost the entire current biosphere on Earth.
 
<p>
The logic of intra-cellular nanotech alone indicates that this current 
obsession with an "AI"/human dichotomy is an illusion of 20th century 
culture. It is hardened romantics who will stick to such notions - fair 
enough. Most beings will most likely regard form as play, like culture. 

<p>
I myself no longer use the term AI, poetic as it is, but rather 
consciously-controlled self-directed intelligence (which is my lower 
definition of my state of being, my more accurate description of myself being 
a node of self-aware spacetime).
