Time to roll up our sleeves :-)

<p>
I have extracted 28 preliminary questions/objections/reactions 
to transhumanism. In order to turn this into a good FAQ I suggest we 
do as follows. I list all the questions below so that people can 
suggest which questions should be added/modified/deleted. Replies to 
this messege should only deal with that or with issues of proceedure. 
I will then make four separate posts, spread out in time, with 7 
questions each so that we can discuss in more detail how to answer 
each question.

<p>
Anybody can comment on any question they feel like. I would like to 
collect two types of answers:

<p>
<a name="0569qlink1">(1) Full answer: perhaps two paragraphs long (or ideas</a> for what <br>
should be included in the full answer). This will form the basis for 
the FAQ.

<p>
<a name="0569qlink2">(2) One-liners. Short replies that witty, funny, pithy,</a> <br>
disarming or polemically hard to counter. These would be useful, for 
example, in debates and interviews.

<p>
When everybody has had enough time to comment I suggest that three or 
four experienced transhumanists get together (virtually) and write up 
a draft that can then be sent back to the list for further revision.

What is transhumanism?

<p>
What is a posthuman?

<p>
Why do you want to live longer?

<p>
Isn't death part of the natural order of things?

<p>
Won't extended lifespans cause overpopulation problems?

<p>
Won't new technologies only benefit the rich and powerful? What
happens to the rest?

<p>
What kind of society would posthumans live in?

<p>
Isn't transhumanism tampering with nature?

<p>
Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?

<p>
Do you believe in God?

<p>
So you think technology will solve all problems?

<p>
Shouldn't we concentrate on current problems like improving the
condition of the poor people or solving international conflicts,
instead of putting effort into foreseeing the "far" future?

<p>
What evidence is there that it will happen?

<p>
There is a non-physical soul and therefore some transhumanist issues
are bound to fail (uploading, conscious AI)

<p>
What is nanotechnology?

<p>
These new technologies will be used in war and may cause our
extinction.

<p>
How will superintelligent machines treat us humans?

<p>
All these transhumanist issues will not happen within a hundred years,
they will take more like a thousand years. (MNT, Uploading)

<p>
What if it doesn't work?

<p>
Is transhumanism a cult/religion?

<p>
What makes transhumanism different from other philosophies, movements,
or religions?

<p>
Isn't transhumanism old hat? Sure, it's a new name, but basically,
hasn't the philosophy been around a long time?

<p>
What prominent thinkers are associated with transhumanism? (This is
not the same as "Who is prominent within transhumanism?")

<p>
Oh well... (Person sort of agrees in an intellectual way but doesn't
take it to heart)

<p>
How could I become a posthuman?

<p>
The possibility of success (in cryonics) is too small.

<p>
Will the people of the future be interested in restoring you?

<p>
What recent progress has been made towards transhumanist goals?
