<p>
    That's about 90% of it, yes.


<p>
<a href="0120.html#0245qlink2">&gt;Individuals *can*, of course, have a code of ethics separate from the</a><br>
group,

<p>
    And here's the other 10%:  Yes, you individually, and I individually,
ALWAYS
<br>
decide the ethics of an act on our own, even if we change our mind after
more consideration, or new info comes to light.</a>

<p>
<a name="0254qlink2"><a href="0120.html#0245qlink3">&gt;but when there is disagreement between two individuals' ethics, the most</a><br>
<i>&gt;reasonable course is to make a judgement based on consensual ethical</i><br>
<i>&gt;standards.  In other words, whether harm was done must ultimately be left</i><br>
up
<br>
<a href="0120.html#0245qlink4">&gt;to a jury of your peers.</a><br>

<p>
    I totally agree (at least in most cases, where immediate action isn't
required)

<p>
    However, the jury is making their own subjective judgement(s), even if
they all happen to agree. The result of thier decision making doesn't make
the act
<br>
OBJECTIVELY ethical or unethical (although the CONSEQUENCES of their
decision has objective reality, ie, the perpetrator going to prison).</a>
<p>
     I *may* decide to grow an "illegal" plant, but a jury's subjective
judgements
<br>
may land me in prison, even though I feel it's ethical to grow a certain
plant.
<p>
    I may go to jail for helping a runaway slave in the early south, even
tho I feel it's
<br>
ethical to do so.
<p>
    I may shoot somebody in self-defense and go to jail, even tho I felt I
was
<br>
totally justified.

<p>
    In all cases, the jury decides in thier *subjective judgement* if I go
to jail, or
<br>
not.

<p>
    But all these decisions of the jury and myself ARE subjective
judgements, not objective. An objective judgement would be "I am sitting in
my living room", or
<br>
"This table is 4 ft high".


<p>
 A sociopath can't be allowed to harm whoever s/he
<br>
<a href="0120.html#0245qlink5">&gt;wishes simply because s/he has a *different* set of ethical standards.</a><br>

<p>
    Definitely not. That's why we have have juries &amp; judges &amp; arbitration.


<p>
<a href="0120.html#0245qlink6">&gt;Likewise, a chronic *victim* cannot be allowed to gain by unfairly accusing</a><br>
<i>&gt;others of harming them.  Both individuals may be acting ethically from</i><br>
their
<br>
<a href="0120.html#0245qlink7">&gt;frame of reference, but to use a phrase I've hear often lately... So what?</a><br>

<p>
    So what, indeed. OTHER people (you and I) decide if and what actions
to take in the above circumstances.


<p>
<a href="0120.html#0245qlink8">&gt;Ethical standards have little meaning if they are confined to the</a><br>
individual
<br>
<i>&gt;level.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0254qlink5">    Ethical standards have NO meaning if they are confined</a> to the individual
level.
<p>
<a name="0254qlink6">     Morals has to do with the individual level. Ethics has to do</a> with how
<a name="0254qlink7">we relate to others.</a>

<p>
<a name="0254qlink3">    But I don't think that's what you meant. I think you meant we can't let
people decide
<br>
"for themselves" what is ethical or not. But that's precisely what they DO
do.
<br>
The rub comes in when it's time for others to deal with those</a> decisions when
acted
<br>
<a name="0254qlink4">upon in reality. Then others can decide "for themselves" how THEY
subjectively
<br>
judge an act.


<p>
Anyway I still disagree with your original assertion at the top of
<br>
<i>&gt;this post:</i><br>

<p>
    I'm assuming you mean this one: "Ethics and morals are totally
subjective."</a>

<p>
    But you said this: "Yes, a better response to your original statement is
that
<br>
ethics are generally defined to be the rules of conduct (or the moral
percepts) of a
<br>
particular culture or group, and as such are understandably subjective."

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;S.B.</i><br>


<p>
<a name="0254qlink8">    By the way, I take "Objective" to mean "existing in reality". I take
subjective to
<br>
mean "existing in the mind". So I do hope we're not working with different
ideas of subjective and objective.</a>
