I will, thanks. 

<p>
<a href="0405.html#0415qlink5">&gt;&gt; Right, except for certain purposes (which is</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; usually all that matters).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Which purposes?</i><br>

<p>
Those which only require that the object 
perform in a certain manner.  For instance,
we can say that two "Toyota Corrola" cars
are "the same", because they are 
<br>
*functionally* the same.  Even if they were
identical in every respect, down to the
<br>
molecular level, I am sure you would agree
that we really have *two* cars, not just
one that we are confusing as two.  It is 
convenient  shorthand to say that an 
<br>
object which is functionally identical to 
another is the same, but we are now 
<br>
reaching territory (uploading, IP, etc) 
where it matters *to the object considered* 
whether it is really the same object, or just 
one which is like it.  As far as I can see, I 
agree with Harvey Newstrom's earlier 
<br>
post on the subject.

<p>
<a href="0405.html#0415qlink6">&gt;And for that matter, why should we adopt a definition of</a><br>
<i>&gt;the word "same" which doesn't ever describe anything?  </i><br>

<p>
Well, I agree we need another word, but
<br>
until recently "same" worked perfectly
<br>
well as it was. :)

<p>
<i>&gt;I'd much rather say</i><br>
<a href="0405.html#0415qlink7">&gt;that any two things which can't be differentiated are the same and leave</a><br>
<i>&gt;it at that. </i><br>

<p>
Since we cannot differentiate your
<br>
copy of Phillip Glass' music from 
<br>
mine, are they really the same 
<br>
music, or can we separate them?

<p>
<a href="0405.html#0415qlink8">&gt;&gt; Since he has stopped having</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; thoughts indefinitely, how does</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; his plight differ from the same </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; stopping of existence without</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; copies?  *He* is still quite dead.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Except what's that thing over there having thoughts and (up until</i><br>
<i>&gt;recently) indiscernible from the man on the floor?  *Him*, I'd say.</i><br>

<p>
I would say that that other person *may*
be the same person, if his consciousness
was not interupted in the transfer.  If there
is a point at which there are two copies
in the same time, then at least one of them
is not the original.
