Recently, a judge ruled that it was unconstitutional to punish someone for
marijuana posession, citing the hypocrisy inherent in allowing alcohol and
nicotine, and banning THC.  I'm not sure if this will set up a legal
precedent or not.

<p>
The head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police made a public statement that
it was okay to grow marijuanna for personal consumption.

<p>
Since we have no FBI, one town in British Columbia decided to legalize
marijuana.  There is nothing stopping them from doing this.

I thought USA was supposed to be the decentralized one?!?

<p>
That's because America has federally-imposed mandatory minimum sentences,
so judges cannot lighten a possession sentence, or make an offender
elligible for parol.  You'd think judges would have some sort of body to
lobby stuff like this.  I know I'd be miffed if I was a judge and the feds
were telling me I had to incarcerate a pot smoker for longer than a
rapist/murderer (no exaggeration!)
