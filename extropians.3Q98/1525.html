What's a 'real' name?


<UL>
  <li>  Endive McCartney

<p>
2besure. I've had four now. My first name, a traditional male family 
name, has been used for at least four centuries (I was the fourth in a 
row with it, the other tradional male family name in my family was used 
eight generations in a row). 
<br>
Under common law, usage can namechange too. What happens when a person 
uses one name on the Internet and one in business, say? 

<p>
I always call anyone by whatever they want to be called.

<p>
Anyhow, why can't people have more than one name? Like more than one 
marriage partner, it should be legal!

<p>
In Victoria, Australia, you cannot change your name for 'frivolous' 
reasons, or change it by deed poll for a period of one year after 
changing it. When I changed my name to Avatar Polymorph I listed the 
reason as 'philosophical'. $28 later, no problemo.
