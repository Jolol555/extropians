<p>
Certainly, this is what caused my reaction to the initial postings in this
debate: not the content per se, but the mode of expression chosen (which I
selected to interpret at face value, rather than perform a 'benefit of the
doubt' analysis, I must confess).

<p>
Speaking up for once (and I should say at this point that my usual lurking
is a function of time-constraint rather than apathy), I'm concerned about
your use of 'we' in this last paragraph, Robin. Personally, I do feel that
</a>
the majority of people on this list value women, but I'm not sure that
allows the use of the global 'we'. In the spirit of your post, however, I
agree that the approach to the minority should be one designed to engender
understanding and a positive way forward.

<p>
<a href="1350.html#1374qlink3">&gt;But let's also remember: male pain is real, and deserves attention, even </a><br>

<p>
<a name="1392qlink2">Perhaps a problem to be addressed before considering the real issue here is
what we mean by, 'nerd'. I think nerd has connotations of appearance,
social skills and psychological make-up, each of which contribute in their
own way to the attractiveness, or otherwise, of the 'nerd';</a> it is also a
fairly gender-specific category, which is ex necessite qualified with
'female' when used to describe a woman. I don't recall ever having met a
female nerd, and I'm not qualified to talk about the male nerd's
attractiveness or otherwise, but perhaps by breaking down the qualities
that create the category 'nerd' others may be able to provide some insight
in to the problems which they are expressing. And helping others to
overcome their own perceived limitations seems to me to be an very
Extropian thing to do.
