LC&gt;  Would the fact that we find ourselves numbering less than
<br>
<a href="1819.html#1856qlink1">&gt; 100 billion truly give us reason to suspect we are among the</a><br>
<i>&gt; unfortunate slated to perish soon?  That depends upon whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; or not the question is being asked by someone who _fairly</i><br>
<i>&gt; chose our civilization to pick on_ by offering this bet.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1950qlink1">NB&gt; In a sense you are betting against yourself when you decide
<br>
<a href="1835.html#1856qlink2">&gt; how to plan your life in view of your estimates of how long our</a><br>
<i>&gt; species will survive.</i><br>

<p>
Precisely; which is why you are not an acceptable random sample.
If we are betting a short-lived civilization against a longlived
 one, then we must offer the bet to a random sample of ALL
the postulated possible civilizations, not just the one at hand.</a>
You can't have it both ways: either other civilizations are
postulated, in which case we are not a good sample, or else we
are a good sample, in which case we may not postulate others.

<p>
Bayes' requires an initial P(H), and P(E|~H).  The former
doesn't matter much; it can be vanishingly small and still
generate a final probability as high as 1/3 in my examples.
But the latter--the prior probability of finding the evidence
conditioned on the negation of the hypothesis--i.e., how
likely are we to find our birth order small if we are a
sample from the postulated civilizations other than ours--
is critical.  A large final result requires this prior to be
large; and the larger this is, the poorer a sample we are.
