<i>&gt;is either flat or sharp.  Either the increases in I and O are self-sustaining,</i><br>

<i>&gt;In technology progress with constant intelligence, you have t' = t, which</i><br>

<i>&gt;function of technology (i = t), and given that intelligence sets the rate of</i><br>
<i>&gt;exponential technological growth, I think a more realistic model is t' = e^t,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which yields -log(-t), which goes to infinity.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2626qlink1">"I think a more realistic model is" is not a sufficiently detailed argument. 
for t' = a*e^(b*(t+c)).  And even accepting this form, substantial growth 
could still take centuries, depending on the values of a,b,c.  

<p>
Your argument here seems awfully close to the claim that "the doubling time 
of computer hardware efficiency is proportional to the computer operations 
per second devoted to R&amp;D in computer hardware, or within all of computer-aided 
`humanity.'"<a name="2626qlink2">  If you recall, this was my summary of the assumption behind an
</a>
analysis from a web page of yours, and I gave specific empirical criticisms 
of it.  You have not yet responded to them.</a>

<p>
<a name="2626qlink3">There really is a rich economic growth literature on when various equations 
like this describe different growing systems, including intelligent systems. 
Growth depends on many factors, and just because a previously fixed factor is
allowed to grow, that doesn't mean growth suddenly explodes.</a>
