<p>
after doing some calculations, i ask you to ignore my previous posts on
the subject of roton.  i repent!  i was a nattering nabob of negativity!
{8-[
<br>
now i will explain how i went wrong.  first, i was going by an earlier
concept of roton, that given in the final frontier magazine.  that article

<p>
presented the concept strictly as a single stage to orbit/reentry body,
which one
<br>
need not assume.  a roton concept can be used as a first stage, second
stage, or a throwaway non-reentry system.  after i convinced myself that
the rotors would be heavier than the cryopumps they would replace, i
tossed the whole thing aside.  (single stage to orbit has verrry little
margin
<br>
for unnecessary weight).

<p>
secondly, i failed to realize that the roton system not only obviates the
cryopumps, it also eliminates the need for thrust vector control.  i never

<p>
did see this stated anywhere, but a roton would be inherently stable due
to the gyroscopic rotor.  much weight is saved by using fixed nozzles.

<p>
thirdly, and this is the most embarrassing, i failed to even consider the
cost.  cryopumps are inherently expensive and tweaky.  and dangerous.
for being a classical thinking rocket scientist, who considers *only
performance*
<br>
ignoring cost and complication, well, i guess i am the poster child.  {8-]

<p>
even if the roton gives up some performance to conventional designs, it is
waaay
<br>
simpler and cheaper than the alternative.  i guess this is why amateur
groups never
<br>
deal with liquid rockets: cryopumps and thrust vector control cannot
really be done at a reasonable cost.  but a roton could be imagined which
has very few moving parts, and none with the kind of difficult
manufacturing
<br>
tolerances associated with high capacity cryogen pumps.

<p>
now, after all that apology, i would suggest those who would sell the
roton
<br>
concept should emphasize its real strengths.  it is sold as a possible
reentry
<br>
body: i still have serious doubts about that.  however, if a launcher is
simple
<br>
and cheap enough, why worry about getting it back?  sell it as a means of
lifting raw materials to orbit very cheaply, in the form of rotons.
perhaps a
<br>
manufacturing facility could be set up in orbit, and the raw materials
could
<br>
be obtained by taking rotons apart, that were launched into orbit just for

<p>
that purpose.  spike
