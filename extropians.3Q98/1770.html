<i>&gt;worlds?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would say 1/2. Finding myself being a human would give me no</i><br>
<i>&gt;information as to the number of stones.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But in order to get this result we need to assume that there was a</i><br>
<i>&gt;zero chance that you would have been a stone.</i><br>

<p>
I wasn't considering universes of different sizes, but on reflection
my prior gives exactly the result you prefer.  As you recall, my
approach was to divide universes into space-time regions, define
states as universe-space-time combinations, and put equal priors
across such states.</a>

<p>
It seems as if both of your worlds have one time slot, world A has
100 spatial slots, and world B has a million + 100 spatial slots.
Equal priors on states implies unequal priors on worlds (where the
prior of a world adds up all the priors of states associated with it.)
But then conditioning on being a human, we get equal world posteriors
back again.

<p>
<a href="1764.html#1770qlink2">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What prior would you assign to world * in my example? ...</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ... I would say P(*) = 1/3. This would be the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;absolute prior. Then you take account of the fact that you exist,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;... you renormalize and get P(#) = P(@) = 1/2. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you seem to prefer p(*) = 1/3, p(#) = 7/20, p(@) = 3/20. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I instead prefer all three being 1/3. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;But I too would say all absolute priors three are 1/3. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; We seem to disagree on the math here. I say that since the probability</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of existing conditional on being in universes # and @ is different,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which I deny!  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let's take it slowly and write it out in full:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let * be "Universe * exists." And similarly for # and @. Let Me be "I</i><br>
<i>&gt;exist."  P(*)=1/3  P(#)=1/3  P(@)=1/3</i><br>
<i>&gt;P(Me | #) = ... (3/2)P(Me)</i><br>
<i>&gt;P(Me | @) = ... (3/2)P(Me)</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't see any inconsistency.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1788qlink2">Consistent perhaps, but it doesn't address the model I detailed.
Perhaps it is my fault for not more clearly distinguishing states from
universes.  A state says which is the true universe *and* which space-time
spot I occupy.  I was preferring equal priors over *states*.</a>  If the prior
of a universe it taken to be the sum of priors of associated states, then
in that sense I also prefer equal priors over universes.

<p>
In my model "I exist" was interpreted first as "I'm an H or P".  Since
universe @ has more space-time slots filled by Hs and Ps than universe #
has, then P(I'm H or P | @) &gt; P(I'm H or P | #) if all the states
associated with a universe have equal priors.

<p>
<a href="1764.html#1770qlink3">&gt;&gt; But my paper does things exactly the way I'm reccomending here.</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I choose a prior to have nice natural independence properties,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; without assuming that I exist.  I then condition on my existing and</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="1788qlink3"><i>&gt;But when you are conditioning on your existing, what you do is</i><br>
<i>&gt;increase the probability of those worlds with many observers (SIA).</i><br>
<i>&gt;... And I say, if you look in</i><br>
<i>&gt;one place, and find an X there, then that gives you reason to believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;there are many Xs; but *only* if the reason why you looked where you</i><br>
<i>&gt;looked was not that there was an X there. Otherwise independence</i><br>
<i>&gt;fails. That's why you can't infer "There are many quick evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt;processes." (I assume you agree with that?)</i><br>

<p>
No, I don't follow this.<a name="1788qlink4">  I don't see what independence has to do
</a>
with anything.  To repeat myself again, the way to figure out what
you can infer is to set up a state space, a prior, information sets,
and turn the crank.</a>  That tells you everything there is to say about
what you can infer.  No independence need be assumed for this to work.
