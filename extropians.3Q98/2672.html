On the contrary, I take very seriously a zero based system that gave
rise to things like research on the death penalty, capitalism,
catholicism, the U.N. and indeed very effective forms of hypocritical
suppression. This along with my belief that computers would ultimately
be able to gain greater AI power by reverting to a context sensitive
form of mathematics is why I became a heretic.

<a name="2676qlink1">Systems need to change and they need to be able to anticipate their own
future behavior or change and the constructions that permit them to see
themselves across some stages of change. My gut feeling is that zero
can't do this. That's why I spat back a barbed compliment in response to
</a>
your troll. The fact that you objected to IAN GODDARD = 0 shows to me
that you have some residual doubt in your own theory.
