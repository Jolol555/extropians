Yes, mine too. Provided it will not instantly radiate explosively, and

Aye, that's the rub.

Yes, perhaps we should should start writing blightlets for the global
networks of now and the near future -- this should steel our networks
against spontaneously emerged and deliberately constructed perversion 
attacks, and make people aware of what might be coming. Human tiger 
teams, so to speak. Of course we should take care not to trigger the 
Big One by mistake. Little danger for it just now....

I think the emergence of SI is always singular, because it overruns
the existing substrate dish so rapidly leaving no chance to its
spontaneously emerged competitor. Though we don't now how first
autoreplicators emerged in the prebiological ursoup, I think they
might have spread as fulminantly after nucleation.

<p>
It could grow way more rapidly by autoreplication. There is little
variation between human specimens, so just a small sample would
seem to suffice, and entire world knowledge will be online by then. 
(Not that I think a mere cubic meter of quantum dots will be ever 
prone to a bit of artistic crisis).

Yes, it's a glass darkly. But speculation is fun!
