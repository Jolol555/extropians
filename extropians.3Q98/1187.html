<i>&gt; wax paper, comfortingly annonymous and 'safe' (emotionally neutral) as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; piece of fruit?</i><br>

<p>
Thats the point of my original argument. However, if we all were put back into
a pretechnological world, 99.99% of the people would die from starvation, with
harvestable animal food all around them, which is irrelevant to the original
discussion. The discussion was about making healthy sources of protein with a
minimum of 'suffering and pain'.  I countered that since the whole idea of
wanting to avoid 'suffering and pain' in killing animals was an animal rightist
response, that the better idea PR wize is to engineer a healthy source of self
reproducing protein which most animal rightists would have no aversion to
killing. Since empathy with animals is mostly a matter of a human
anthropomorphizing upon the features of animals that humans see as 'cute', i.e.
features one normally sees in children (large eyes, large heads, and other
childlike features), reducing the 'cuteness' of an animal would obviously
reduce an animal rightists aversion to killing it, as well as reduce its
usability for photogenic PR campaigns put on by animal rightists.

<i>&gt; other free beasts has a respect for the animal, a special relationship</i><br>
<i>&gt; unknown to the masses huddled up to the teat of factory farms.</i><br>

<p>
yes, an individual who has never had to directly associate their daily food
supply with them actively harvesting animals tends to have a reduced inhibition
to anthropomorphize animals.

<a href="1168.html#1187qlink3">&gt; Some vegetarians and certainly many run-of-the-mill McDeath-scarfers both</a><br>
<i>&gt; say, "Oh, yuck, how gross," flinching with discomfort, because they have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; connection to the living animal or to the act of butchery; it's foreign,</i><br>
<i>&gt; alien, and they wouldn't want to face their dependence on something</i><br>
<i>&gt; repulsive.  The spawn of our suburbs have no respect for meat animals</i><br>
<i>&gt; because they've never raised them, never hunted them, never killed by</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves and learned from the experience; we relate to plastic-wrapped</i><br>
<i>&gt; beef in the supermarket on the same thoughtless level as we think about</i><br>
<i>&gt; fruit, in so far as we think about it at all.  Just pluck the morsel from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the branch; no thought before or emotions after, never mind how it got</i><br>
<i>&gt; there.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; At any rate, deliberately to create walking McNuggets would play right into</i><br>
<i>&gt; apathy and the  irrational selfishness of the American suburban belly.  How</i><br>
<i>&gt; on earth does it increase extropy --particularly the aspects we admire of</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge, vitality and beauty-- to breed something for its ugliness so as</i><br>
<i>&gt; to manipulate fear?</i><br>

<p>
Not to manipulate fear, but to reduce the manipulability of an animals features
for anthropomorphising. I've never seen a 'Save the sea cucumber!", or "Save
the slime mold!" campaign, have you??? It increases extropy in that it
increases the supply of healthy, self reproducing protein sources for the human
food supply, which will be needed in the next 50 years as the world population
rises from 5.5 billion now up to 18 billion before it tops off....

<p>
nanotech will definitely, with sufficient sophistication, allow production of
as tasty a hunk of beef as one could hope for, but I'd doubt that you could get
any vegan to eat it who can afford alternatives.
