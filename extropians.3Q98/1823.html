<p>
I don't think Leslie disagrees with any of that. Note that he says 
"what observers should expect to observe" which is not the same as 
"what there should be".

<a href="1817.html#1823qlink2">&gt; We ordinarily want to talk about what would happen if I died or </a><br>

<p>
I don't understand this. If humans never evolved, you would never 
have existed. Nowhere around would there be an observer with the 
RobinHanson-properties. What you now refer to when you 
say "I" would not have existed.

<p>
<a name="1827qlink1"><a href="1817.html#1823qlink3">&gt; Doomsday argument folks also seem to want talk about the possibility</a><br>
<i>&gt; that I might have been some other human at some other place in </i><br>
<i>&gt; space-time.</i><br>

<p>
That is only shorthand. You can replace this phraseology if 
you find it problematic. Instead you can talk about the possibility 
that Robin Hanson, while remaining Robin Hanson, could forget certain 
facts, and about what probabilities RH would then assign to the 
hypothesis that RH is living in such-and-such a place and time. 
That's actually quite simple.</a>

<p>
... But to say that there is a fact of the matter as to whether you 
are the pear and I'm the apple, or the other way around, in a 
possible world which contains only these two objects - and you seem 
to accept that you are committed to this view - now *that* seems to 
me metaphysical in excelsior.

<p>
<a name="1827qlink2">I don't see why you should would want to stick to that view. You can 
admit that only observers can enter the reference class while still 
holding on to your view that we should accept the SIA and thereby 
cancel the DA.</a>
