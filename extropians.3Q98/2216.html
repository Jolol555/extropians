<p>
21st Century Medicine (21CM) is the only company in the
world with a well-funded research program to achieve suspended
animation.  21CM occupies two buildings in Rancho Cucamonga,
California that are about a quarter of a mile apart.  The first building
houses the company's Critical Care Medicine Division, which is
conducting advanced research to restore clinically dead patients
to life (resuscitation), and to induce rapid, reversible, full-body
cooling in patients suffering from hyperthermia (dangerously high
body temperature).

<p>
        The second building houses the company's Cryobiology
Division, where 21CM scientists are exploring new vistas in cryopreservation.
  Revolutionary 21CM breakthroughs in freezing and
vitrification represent significant progress in the company's quest to
achieve perfected cryopreservation of hearts, kidneys, brains, and,
eventually, entire human beings.

<p>
        On Sunday, Nov. 8, 1998, 21CM will present a seminar on
its research findings in the 3rd floor Amphitheatre at the Marriott
Hotel
<br>
on 2200 E. Holt Blvd., near Ontario Airport in Southern California.
There
<br>
will be formal presentations by 21CM scientists from 9am to 1pm,
followed by lunch and guided tours of the 21CM buildings until 5pm. 
Here is the formal program for the Seminar: (Videotapes of the
proceedings will be available from 21CM).

9:00 - 9:30 - REVOLUTIONARY BREAKTHROUGHS IN CRYOBIOLOGY
<p>
              By Gregory M. Fahy, Ph.D. &amp; Brian Wowk, Ph.D

<pre>
             The exciting news about the recent fundamental
             advances in cryoprotection that herald a new
             era in cryomedicine, by the scientists who made
             them.

9:30 - 10:00 - FREEZING/VITRIFICATION OF SIMPLE BIOLOGIC SYSTEMS
              By Gregory M. Fahy, Ph.D. &amp; Brian Wowk, Ph.D

              How 21CM's technologic advances are leading
              to improved methods of cryopreserving sperm,
              embryos, corneas, skin and other biological
              tissues, as well as engineered tissues
              developed by biotech companies.

</pre>
<p>
10:00 - 10:15 - EARLY-MORNING BREAK

<p>
10:15 - 10:45 - VITRIFICATION OF ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANT
<pre>
                By Gregory M. Fahy, Ph.D.

             How improved vitrification solutions are leading
             to dramatic advances in the cryopreservation of
             complex organs and organisms.

10:45 - 11:15 - ADVANCES IN BRAIN RESUSCITATION
                By Mike Darwin

              Astonishing breakthroughs that have enabled 21CM
              scientists to restore dogs to healthy life after
              up to 17 minutes without oxygen at normal body
              temperature.

11:15 - 11:45 - A NEW METHOD OF INDUCING HYPOTHERMIA
                By Mike Darwin

              How "liquid breathing" can reduce core body
              temperature dramatically, without direct access
              to the circulatory system.

</pre>
<p>
11:45 - 12 Noon -  LATE-MORNING BREAK

<p>
12 Noon - 1pm -  HOW SOON CAN WE ACHIEVE SUSPENDED ANIMATION?
<pre>
             Panel discussion with Gregory M. Fahy, Ph.D,
             Brian Wowk, Ph.D, Steve Harris, M.D. and Mike Darwin
             moderated by Saul Kent, with comments and questions
             from the audience.

     At 1pm, conference registrants will be transported to 21CM's
</pre>
laboratories for lunch and guided tours of both 21CM buildings.
21CM staff will be available throughout the afternoon for
informal discussions regarding 21CM research and its implications
for medicine and society.
