Given a choice, I would of course choose to continue to exist. Both of 
"us" would. The point I was trying (inexpertly) to make, was that the 
shutting off of an emulation is neither morally nor practically 
equivalent to "death". It's something deeper. Maybe more to be feared, 
maybe less, but certainly different. From the point of view of a virtual 
being that knew it was going to be deactivated, I would be less anxious 
then I would be over impending physical "death" within the context of a 
continuing virtual world. Perhaps it's a hind-brain egoistic bias, or 
the fact that an instantaneous shutdown promises A) lack of pain, B) 
lack of perception/comprehension, and C) a promise of at least potential 
resumption of processing.

<p>
In answer to Mr. Finney's question, No, I do not believe that having 
one's universe-process suspended counts as death. Facetiuosly, prove 
that your universe-process hasn't been suspended for better then 200 
(years?) between the moment you opened this email and when you started 
reading it.
