<i>&gt;different sub-cultures and communities will express itself in new forms </i><br>
<i>&gt;of complex and developed art, which, since their birth in salons and </i><br>
<i>&gt;bohemia, have struggled to exist within a culture of mass production, </i><br>
<i>&gt;distribution monopolies and limited cybernetics. The more formal </i><br>
<i>&gt;artistic avant-garde will also become more expressive, though at a </i><br>
<i>&gt;slightly later date, since it is politically tied to the current </i><br>
<i>&gt;socio-economic system for the period while work remains existant in its </i><br>
<i>&gt;current form. What are some of the forces driving these forthcoming </i><br>
<i>&gt;changes? </i><br>

<p>
I agree with the examples as listed below:

<p>
<a href="1281.html#1354qlink2">&gt;New materials.</a><br>
<i>&gt;Controlled materials.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Accessible, low-cost and non-hierachial infrastructures.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Artist-controlled distribution networks.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A new abundance of ability.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A new abundance of leisure.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Increased information and congruence of information.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Increased control of the body.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Increased control of an increasingly interactive environment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Increased control of neurological consciousness and variation of its </i><br>
<i>&gt;structure.</i><br>

<p>
I'd add interested in:

<p>
extreme life extension
<br>
migration into space
<br>
advent of synthetic realities
<br>
sub-personalities and secondary bodies
<br>
sensory mixes and augmentations


<p>
<a href="1281.html#1354qlink3">&gt;Already, it is difficult to follow the many possibilities being opened </a><br>
<i>&gt;up in biology, nanotechnology and computing. These range from tens of </i><br>
<i>&gt;molecular supercomputers inside individual cells to using radiotelescope </i><br>
<i>&gt;networks as a sensory organ to watch the stars directly. Advanced </i><br>
<i>&gt;automation and nanotechnology (which involves consciously constructed </i><br>
<i>&gt;atomic and molecular arrangements and materials containing extremely </i><br>
<i>&gt;large numbers of molecular supercomputers linked to assemblers and </i><br>
<i>&gt;disassemblers), followed later by artificial or consciously constructed </i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence, will result in the end of required manual work and the </i><br>
<i>&gt;disappearance of capital (as self-replication of automated production </i><br>
<i>&gt;systems does not require organized manual labour driven by provision of </i><br>
<i>&gt;goods and services as reward). Any sentient being will potentially be </i><br>
<i>&gt;capable of choosing to control its level of intelligence and its </i><br>
<i>&gt;component systems, including choice of lifespan. For example, crossovers </i><br>
<i>&gt;between DNA computers and nanotechnology could result in the exchange of </i><br>
<i>&gt;complex information through the saliva of a kiss.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;PRACTICAL EXAMPLES</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Billboard"</i><br>
<i>&gt;Use of nanopaper or screenpaint to coat billboards distributed above </i><br>
<i>&gt;artist warehouses and displaying downloads of  art, whether video or </i><br>
<i>&gt;painterly. For example, 30-second interval displays of the performance </i><br>
<i>&gt;artist during a 24-hour period. The same principle can apply to </i><br>
<i>&gt;wallscreens, roomscreens, materials coating (for example, coating of </i><br>
<i>&gt;cars), clothes, 'poster' pillars, "outside galleries" (galleries with </i><br>
<i>&gt;exterior display) and simultaneous galleries (galleries with identical </i><br>
<i>&gt;rotating and simultaneous displays at a variety of sites around the </i><br>
<i>&gt;world). Institutions such as artbanks will cater for such needs.</i><br>

<p>
This is an idea I have been thinking about for quite some time, especially
after my most recent visit to Las Vegas where the billboards vibrate with
brilliant colors and images.  I would like to take my animation performance
piece "The Aesthetics of Memetic Evolution" and put it up billboard size.

<p>
<a href="1281.html#1354qlink4">&gt;"Nanopainting"</a><br>
<i>&gt;Use of nanomaterials to provide 3-dimensional simulation of brushstrokes </i><br>
<i>&gt;and painterly effects, capable of modifying themselves.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1281.html#1354qlink5">&gt;"King Kong"</a><br>
<i>&gt;You inhabit a virtual body six storeys high, venturing down a virtual </i><br>
<i>&gt;Brunswick Street to lift cars and pick the tops off buildings. Point of </i><br>
<i>&gt;eyesight view, however, comes not from your virtual eyes but a rotating </i><br>
<i>&gt;panorama. As your journey begins you start to shrink….</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Spireshadow"</i><br>
<i>&gt;Modelling their work on the famous 1960s computer simulation, a group of </i><br>
<i>&gt;sculptures create a short-term sculptural spire of immense height that </i><br>
<i>&gt;casts its shadow on the precise day the precise distance across </i><br>
<i>&gt;Melbourne to reach the border house from the shoreline. Impossible? No.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"MCG edit"</i><br>
<i>&gt;100,000 automated cameras track players and viewpoints, including </i><br>
<i>&gt;personal choice shots, and store all visual data of the Grand Final. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Viewers create their own 'director's cut' and compare notes while </i><br>
<i>&gt;imbiding vegetarian VB (VB without filtration through animal products).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Nano suitmask"</i><br>
<i>&gt;Gymnastics unheard of in the past are possible with diamond-muscle </i><br>
<i>&gt;sheathing controlled by millions of molecular supercomputers.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Patterning and shifting of skin and mask enable artistic expression of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the Circus Oz version of the Tempest atop four adjacent city rooftops, </i><br>
<i>&gt;with appropriate leaping and tumbling.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Flower bed"</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your bed and bedroom are augmented by genetically sculptured flowers, </i><br>
<i>&gt;which form the ceiling and open to the morning Sun while selected </i><br>
<i>&gt;psychedelic neurotransmitters are wafted your way, according to your </i><br>
<i>&gt;mood.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Fogset"</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nanotech utility fogs lift the players up and surround their bodies. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Like vampiric hosts, they float in the material as the Earth turns, </i><br>
<i>&gt;hiding the Sun, while playing high-speed three-dimensional metachess and </i><br>
<i>&gt;composing haiku. Afterwards they gather and discuss the game, vying to </i><br>
<i>&gt;ensure that the best players are ensured the honour of victory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Villa of the Mysteries"</i><br>
<i>&gt;Virtual and overt realities merge in this historic reenactment of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;ancient rites, modelled on Pompeii. Participants swap visual, aural and </i><br>
<i>&gt;tactile sensory inputs, experiencing the mixed realities from a variety </i><br>
<i>&gt;of perspectives, the shifting patterns modelled on the lava flows of </i><br>
<i>&gt;yesteryear.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Migration of the Spider Homes"</i><br>
<i>&gt;Modifiable houses with hydraulically controlled beds shift on hydraulic </i><br>
<i>&gt;spider legs, foretelling the era of smart houses and thinking cities. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Not content with shifting from beach to forest, they echo the call of </i><br>
<i>&gt;James Blish in "Cities in Flight" by going solar.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Twintown" </i><br>
<i>&gt;A single male body to double female body transformation (consensual and </i><br>
<i>&gt;without neurological override) is ritually enacted, and completed by </i><br>
<i>&gt;Tantric branding. The parameters of the new bodies are decided by vote </i><br>
<i>&gt;of  assembled friends and close relatives, after consultation with the </i><br>
<i>&gt;wish-drive of the person concerned.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Beehive Extravaganze: splitting universe"</i><br>
<i>&gt;Superintelligent self-modified bees are requested to provide their views </i><br>
<i>&gt;on a potential universe design. No longer the province of physicists and </i><br>
<i>&gt;mathematicians, systems design on this scale has broadened to include </i><br>
<i>&gt;more poetic progenitators.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Cyber mandala"</i><br>
<i>&gt;Socio-historical analyses of memetic constructs over the past 2,500 </i><br>
<i>&gt;years are reassembled as cyber mandalas on Simnet (which contains </i><br>
<i>&gt;non-aware virtual versions of past personages) for meditative purposes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Sunsurf"</i><br>
<i>&gt;Flocks of special-material solar sails are infused with the </i><br>
<i>&gt;consciousness of visitors and skim the colder surface of the Sun, their </i><br>
<i>&gt;pleasure centres linked to the erupting solar winds and sunspots.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This projected breakdown of  art as a commodity in the face of </i><br>
<i>&gt;multivalency will seem implausible to some, and wildly improbable to </i><br>
<i>&gt;others, but flows naturally from the increased range of choice about to </i><br>
<i>&gt;race over us. Far more freeform art than the examples quoted above will </i><br>
<i>&gt;surface and interact at many different levels. Mythologies and lives may </i><br>
<i>&gt;well be the new materials, for many. Ascending and descending constructs </i><br>
<i>&gt;within oceans of consciousness are the probable result of our impending </i><br>
<i>&gt;exit from the womb of history into the realm of hypersentiency and </i><br>
<i>&gt;self-directed evolution. From this perspective, Cabaret Voltaire and </i><br>
<i>&gt;Andy Warhol will seem to be precursors to and prophets of the dawn of a </i><br>
<i>&gt;new age. Nation states and corporations may well become the romantic, </i><br>
<i>&gt;semi-tragic dream-phrases of 20th century improbabilities, used for </i><br>
<i>&gt;constructive design purposes and exploration rather than as the spine </i><br>
<i>&gt;and skeleton of our everyday reality.</i><br>
