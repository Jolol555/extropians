<p>
  This is the 23'rd update on my fly longevity experiments. The high summer
temperatures of 30 to 35 C have accelerated fly aging, so that this
experiment was concluded in a month, as opposed to a typical duration of
around two months during the winter months.
  In this run I was primarily interested in seeing the results with
methyl-sulfonyl-methane. Although this supplement proved to be a bust, both
low and high dose marjoram and royal jelly appear to enhance average life
span somewhat. Neither of these lenghtened maximum life span, so no
antiaging effect could be claimed.
<br>
  The high temperatures encouraged pathogen growth in one of my breeding
bottles, which had to be destroyed. The other breeding bottles also had
fewer flies than I had hoped for, so the eleventh run is  rather small. I
am creating more breeding bottles so as to insure a larger twelveth run.
  Many of the supplements I have tested in the past were spices. This had a
disadvantage, in that the amounts of these materials fed the flies were
much larger than the amounts (relatively speaking) that humans typically
consume. I am now mostly switching over to foods that humans typically
consume much larger quantities of. Thus if a food exerts an antiaging
effect in flies, it would be at least possible for humans to consume
similar quantities.
<br>
  The eleventh run focuses exclusively on fruit juices. The most
interesting juice IMHO is cranberry juice, which is known to exert a
protective effect on urinary infections. If this exerts a protective effect
against pathogens for flies it might increase their average life
expectancy.
<br>
  Other juices have other interesting properties. Orange juice exerts a
significant anticancer effect in rodents. Grapefruit juice increases the
absorption of many drugs, but also increases the risk of kidney
stones. Pineapple juice is very effective in inhibiting the browning of
apple rings. (J Food Sci 58(2): 399-404 1993) Whether any of these juices
can increase fly life span is open to conjecture. There exists only one way
to answer this question - do an experiment!
