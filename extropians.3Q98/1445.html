If this were right, it would in itself be an interesting result. It 
would seem to refute the idea that in the future there will be a 
great many intelligent beings.

<p>
But there is a version of the doomsday argument that bites on this 
possibility too. Rather than counting the number of observers, you 
should (arguably) count the number of "observer-moments" - i.e. timesegments
 of observers. In that case you get little respite from 
assuming that birth rates will drop drastically.

<a href="1435.html#1445qlink2">&gt;Secondly, if </a><br>
<i>&gt; AI is hard and uploads are easy then most future life will originate from uploaded humans.</i><br>

<p>
But what's so relevant about being organic?

<p>
<a href="1435.html#1445qlink3">&gt; because any SIs would have memories of</a><br>

<p>
I'm afraid you've lost me here.
