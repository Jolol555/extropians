<p>
Making an exact duplicate of yourself is not necessary.  Assuming the
technology made it economically viable, you could generate an entity that
only had those of your experiances that enabled it to do the work. 

<p>
There is no reason why you would have to give it your exact memories
either, you could take an "off the shelf" package of memories which
ensured the entity would enjoy the work. 

<p>
Having completed the days work and having no knowledge that it has only
been in existence for half a day, the entity would return home to sleep.
At this time the new experiances gained can be downloaded and the entity
terminated.  There is no descision to blow its own brains out.
