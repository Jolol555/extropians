<a name="2716qlink1">Actually, the attitude you describe is partly what I'm trying to avoid
in my ideal community of discourse.  "Yeah, we look wierd, but they 
persecuted Galileo didn't they?  And abolisionists eventually won, right?"  
Yeah, but most "kooks" really are, movements and religions grow for 
lots of reasons besides the accuracy of their factual claims, and most of 
them are not fondly remembered by history.</a>
