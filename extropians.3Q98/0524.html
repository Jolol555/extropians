<i>&gt; stream of liquid to carry a current, a'la taser. I constructed a</i><br>
<i>&gt; prototype with two Super Soakers mounted on a common pistol grip, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; a 20 kV pulse generator connected so that the water streams would</i><br>

<i>&gt; feet range would in itself carry enough energy to be able to seriousl</i><br>
<i>&gt; injure the person aimed at. Also, simply wearing a raincoat renders</i><br>
<i>&gt; the gadget useless.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0533qlink1">Yes, I've read about these on the net. The usual configuration is
a truck-mounted electrified water cannon that can be used against 
crowds. Another interesting potential police weapon is a sort of
super taser that's integrated into a police car. In a chase, a 
harpoon on a wire is shot into the rear of criminal's car, and
a powerful current fries the car's circuitry, stopping the engine
and the chase. There are no harmful side effects to the car's
occupants, besides being arrested of course.</a> 

<p>
<a name="0533qlink2">I've been thinking about a more modest device myself, namely
a stun gun/pepper spray combination (one weapon). This would 
allow you to temporarily disorientate the attacker with the spray,
so that you can move in and zap him. An additional feature could
that the stun gun has different settings for intensity levels,
so that the shock can be adjusted to the target. This is
especially handy for police use (all those poor unarmed
bobbies should have one, for example).</a>
 
<p>
<a href="0514.html#0524qlink2">&gt; About this time I applied for a patent on the device on the chance it</a><br>
<i>&gt; could be somehow debugged - and found that another company had beaten</i><br>
<i>&gt; us to the punch. Their disclosure, unfortunately, missed all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; information my experiments turned up, so that their device is likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; also useless.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0533qlink3">The anti-crowd version may work, but it probably never be much
of a side arm. Could be a fun sport though, like paintball.</a>
 
<p>
<a href="0514.html#0524qlink3">&gt; Other ideas could be use of phased sound - low frequencies have been</a><br>
<i>&gt; shown to disorient wihtout causing permanent harm, but are terribly</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard to project, and ultrasonics can cause discomfort, but the power</i><br>
<i>&gt; level needed is again possibly dangerous. There has been mention in</i><br>
<i>&gt; trade journals of an ultrsonic 'speaker' that can direct audio to an</i><br>
<i>&gt; apparent location in free space by using collimated ultrasonic beams</i><br>
<i>&gt; that have beat notes in the range of the desired frequency. The air</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself becomes the radiator.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0533qlink4">Could mediums such as water be used by the sound waves
to travel over great distances to a kill zone (where</a> possibly several
<a name="0533qlink5">waves from different locations converge and amplify eachother) with
lethal results to man and beast? If so, submarines, or surface
ships, could be fitted with powerful sonic guns instead</a> of cumbersome
<a name="0533qlink6">torpedoes and depth charges. One would think that their nuclear
power plants could generate quite some energy for a shockwave.
It's certainly a very "clean" and discrete weapon, and leaves
no traces (a pocket version would be a great murder weapon,
causing heart attacks and strokes without leaving any tangible
evidence).
