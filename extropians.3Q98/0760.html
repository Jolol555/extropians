No, that's not what I'm talking about, although that's also, by 
definition, a Good Thing (tm :-).

<p>
Which is the higher extropy state?  A woman virtually enslaved to her 
husband as a drudge in, say, Iran, or an author writing popular 
non-fiction in New Zealand?

<p>
Ability-wise, those two people may be very similar.  However, due to a few 
cultural differences -- differences that have only recently come into 
being, and are still rather tenuous -- their personal extropy may be
considerably different.

<p>
For that reason, I'm not at all averse to people discussing these issues 
on this list.  In the here and now, removing unfair discrimination is one 
way of increasing the world's collective extropy.

I'm talking mainly about the present, which will hopefully lay the

Except for the "As a libertarian" part, my mileage doesn't vary.

<p>
I wouldn't be averse to automoderation which added the tag "GUNS" to any 
post which contained the string "gun", to allow easy filtering, for those 
so inclined.

No, did I mention to you that I'm just finishing 12 months working at Los
