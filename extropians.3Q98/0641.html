Now explain why destroying a person's personality is somehow better than
destroying their body? If uploading advocates are correct, then there's
essentially no difference.

<p>
You seem to be arguing that to blow up a computer which is running an
uploaded human would be awful, but to poke around inside that uploaded
human and reprogram it as you see fit is fine.

<p>
Either way the original uploaded human is no longer there, and I see no 
real difference between the two results. Ethically speaking I'd rather
shoot them and be done with it than try to turn them into some 'perfect'
person.
