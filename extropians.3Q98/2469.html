 Mind reading might not be a requirement for a very good copy of some peoples
minds. Authors have been placing their thoughts in the public domain for years.
Coupling that knowledge with their celebrity ( book signings, speaking
engagements, tv interviews, etc) many diverse people would have direct contact
with popular authors and could give useful feedback on personality traits. As to
which authors one might choose to resurect, two spring to mind that might have
personalities that would easily accept their unique state as resurected mosaics.
Dr. Asimov and what , to me is quite fitting, considering his Methusela's
Children stories, Robert Heinlein.
