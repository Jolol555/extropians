Relativity is not a GUT/TOE (in fact we're certain of it), and,
it _does_ seem to allow things like wormholes and causality
violation. One of (alas, too many) interpretations of Fermi's
paradoxon seems to be such expansion, whether relativistic or
otherwise, simply does not occur.

<p>
Assuming, that during the Singularity no new physics will be
discovered, which results in a technology not bottlenecked by such
constraints, as spacetime engineering. (Damn unlikely, of course).

<p>
Assuming we're all alive by then, of course. Technology growth seems
to require a relatively narrow corridor for us to make it into 2098:
too low, and we die of old age, too high, and we're wiped out by a
Blight.
