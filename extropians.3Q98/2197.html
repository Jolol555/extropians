<a name="2334qlink1">Has a certain scientist of our acquaintance bothered to issue any sort of
explanation as to how, precisely, he intends to bring a cloned baby of
himself to full term in his post-menopausal wife?  Does he plan to pump her
full of hormones, or perhaps remove her womb entirely and place it in
</a>stasis?  What happened to the hordes of young fertile volunteers he claimed
were beating down his door to be the first to bear a cloned child?  Has he
provided anything in way of proof that a post-menopausal female can even
sustain a pregnancy without miscarriage or serious harm to herself?

<p>
Really, I just cannot see how this man's utter selfishness and hubris does
anything to promote a rational approach to the development of cloning. If
anything, we can look forward to this being dredged up in various lawmaking
fora around the globe as a primary reason for imposing strict controls on
the technology, or banning it altogether.
