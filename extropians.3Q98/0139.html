<p>
  Forgive me if this is not timely, I just read through yesterday's 
digest..

<p>
     With regards to guns in any society - "An armed citizenry in a 
polite citizenry" - Aldous Huxley (Brave New World). Generally, given 
most individuals desire not to think more than 5 seconds ahead, having a 
majority of the citizenry armed is a way to induce societal 
responsibility, not diminish it. In America, there is an odd societal 
meme that states that protecting oneself,family, and property with 
lethal force from a projectile weapon is somehow wrong. See the recent 
case of an individual being tried for murder in California for shooting 
an individual robbing their home. As a US citizen, you are much better  
off (legally) killing your attacker with your bare hands or a bladed 
weapon. This legal conceptualization (the "right to stand your ground 
law") which has gone out of vouge in the US lately is ,IMO, one of the 
reasons for the increase in violence and severity of crime in the US. 
(There are other cultural memes at work, but that is not the subject of 
this discussion)

<p>
    With regards to the Government encroaching on individual freedoms- 
that is the purpose of governments. The question is whether or not the 
applications of these restrictions are equitable for the stability they 
produce, and whether they are uniformly applied. The US government under 
current law has the power to arrest any person and hold them for 6 
months under no formal charges, to confiscate all of their worldly 
possessions, and since they are technically not under arrest, to do 
anything they like without allowing the "accused" any legal 
representation. (Check the RICO act... " possession of any device 
capable of being used in a fraudulent manner "..." constitutes 
terrorism" This includes fountain pens, credit cards, etc.) As to 
uniform application, look at the case of Bernie S.

<p>
   The question the American people need to consider is if these 
restrictions (i.e. virtually unlimited government authority) are 
equitable for the stability (Ha!) of American society. If not, then the 
mechanisms do exist to repeal the laws, or place other representatives 
in power. 2 problems : 1) I have yet to hear of , meet, or read about 
any candidate for any office (other than the libertarians) who had a 
clue about recent cyberlaws, or their effects. 2) 85% of the American 
people still belive that they directly elect the president, and are able 
to recognize Micheal "Magic" Johnson, but not Alan Greenspan (Argueably 
the most powerful man in the US).

<p>
    The best thing going for most of us (extropians, et. all), as I have 
said previously, is that most of them (governments, politicians, 
managers, pick your Hierarchal structure) are dumber than most of us, 
and while they will resist change, new ideas, and thought with every 
fiber if their little Homer Simpson beings, we can, through patience and 
careful planning, bring them out of their squalor. (Whether they like it 
or not)

<p>
   "Throughout history, poverty is the normal condition of man. Advances 
which permit this norm to be exceeded - here and there, now and then- 
are the work of extremely small minority, frequently despised, often 
condemned, and almost always opposed by all right-thinking people. 
Whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating, or (as sometimes 
happens) is driven out of a society, the people then slip back into 
abject poverty.

<p>
     This is known as "bad luck."" --Heinlein

       
<p>
    As to the ability of individuals who wish to extend the 
biopossibilities of the human race having the ability to kill with a 
clear conscience - "A brute kills for pleasure, a fool kills from hate" 
=-Heinlein again. One of the few downsides to a universe ruled by 
conscious decision and chaotic systems is the fact that "necessary" and 
<br>
"desirable" are not always in sync. To take a life (of any animal, even <br>
people) because it is desirable, is stupid, and wasteful. To take a life 
because it is necessary for food, clothing, shelter, survival, 
preservation of life or individual integrity is not something to become 
<br>
"emotional" about. If "sleeping at night" is an issue, reexamine your <br>
motivations before hand. "Thinking" implies considering the 
possibilities of your actions, their ramifications, and your reactions 
to them.
