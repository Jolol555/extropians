I've been taking melatonin for almost three years now.  At first, I was taking
6 mg 1 hour before bedtime every night.  For the last 18 months, I've cut the
dosage back to 3 mg every evening.  I also use it very effectively it to
address jet lag when I cross lots of time zones.

<p>
<a name="1758qlink1">There's no question in my mind that melatonin works well to reset your clock
and induce sleep with no after-effects of next-day grogginess.</a>  For this
effect alone, I find it extremely valuable, since I otherwise occasionally
suffer from work-induced stress-sleeplessness: Just being able to get a good
night's sleep during high-pressure projects is a high value.

<p>
I believe I have experienced some mild amplification of dream intensity with
melatonin, both in comparison to the time before I took it and those periods
of up to a week when I haven't taken it in the last couple of years.

<p>
<a name="1758qlink2">I can't speak to the potential for broader systemic benefits, since I haven't
done a control with a clone :-) I'm unaware of any long-term rigorous
experiments that are being done, but I'm someone is carrying out such
research.  I would be very curious to see the results of any such studies.</a>
