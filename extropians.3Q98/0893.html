Well, the world is discrete as well. Even if it wasn't you still could 
approximate it arbitrarily close, where you couldn't tell artefacts due
to finite resolution of the model.

Whether they are chemical, or physical, it's ok as long they are magickal.

Very easily, that's called molecular modelling. In fact you would
probably have to reach down as deep as ab initio, to validate the
higher-order models in overlapping strides. Some people have already
coupled MD with QM for realistic enzyme models.
