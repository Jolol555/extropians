That's a tricky definition of change but it's not the only one, e.g.,
FPGA circuits can be made to work without ever using zero.

"One major disadvantage of the Babylonian system however was their lack
of a zero.
<br>
This meant that numbers did not have a unique representation but
required the
<br>
context to make clear whether 1 meant 1, 61, 3601, etc. "

<p>
How I intend to use this analogy in my AI model is by activating the
constructions implied by the "1, 61, 3601, etc. " and then simply
promote the context that eventually causes feedback; without the need to
compare thread results. Massively parallel Internet computers converging
the results of Ingrid's independent component analysis will soon
determine if this approach is valid. If I find evidence that the
Babylonian system can't implement an AI then I'll abandon my quest for
artificial consciousness. Here I'm just using "Babylonian" to refer to
my continuous Ingrid amathematical approach.
