Here is the abstract of my recent publication on the anti-aging hormesis
effects of heat shock on human skin fibroblasts. Previously, anti-aging
effects of heat shock have been reported by others for Drosophila and
nematodes. Since the present experiments with human cells in culture took
much longer time than those for insects and worms, these results are being
published just now.

Summary:        The effects of repetitive mild heat shock (30 min, 41=B0 C)
on growth and various cellular and biochemical characteristics of human
skin fibroblasts undergoing ageing in vitro were analysed. Human skin cells
not only tolerated more than 30 repeated heat shocks throughout their
replicative lifespan, but also maintained several characteristics of young
cells until late in life. Whereas the growth rates, population doubling
rates, and cumulative population doubling levels achieved in vitro remained
unaffected, age-related changes in cellular morphology, cell size,
cytoskeletal organisation, autofluorescence and neutral b-galactosidase
activity were significantly slowed down by repeated mild heat shock. These
hormesis-like effects of stress-induced defence processes can be useful to
elucidate the role of maintenance and repair mechanisms in ageing.

Key words: anti-ageing, homeostasis, hormesis, gerontogenes
