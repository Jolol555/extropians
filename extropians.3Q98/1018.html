Abstract
<br>
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of microalbuminuria and
  overt diabetic nephropathy and other putative risk factors for cardiovascular
  and all cause mortality in insulin dependent diabetes.
  DESIGN: Ten year observational follow up study. SETTING: Outpatient diabetic
  clinic in a tertiary referral centre. SUBJECTS: All 939 adults with insulin
  dependent diabetes (duration of diabetes five years or more) attending the
  clinic in 1984; 593 had normal urinary albumin excretion (&lt; or = 30 mg/24 h),
  181 persistent microalbuminuria (31-299 mg/24 h), and 165 overt nephropathy
<br>
  (&gt; or = 300 mg/24 h). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All cause and cardiovascular<br>
  mortality. RESULTS: Fifteen per cent of patients (90/593)
  with normoalbuminuria, 25% (45/181) with microalbuminuria, and 44% (72/165)
  with overt nephropathy at baseline died during follow up. Cox multiple
  regression analysis identified the following significant
  predictors of all cause mortality: male sex
  (relative risk 2.03; 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 3.02), age (1.07; 1.06
  to 1.08), height (0.96; 0.94 to 0.98), smoking (1.51; 1.09 to 2.08), social
  class V versus social class IV (1.70; 1.25 to 2.31), log10 urinary albumin
  excretion (1.45; 1.18 to 1.77), hypertension (1.63; 1.18 to 2.25), log10
  serum creatinine concentration (8.96; 3.34 to 24.08), and haemoglobin A1c
  concentration (1.11; 1.03 to 1.20). Age, smoking, microalbuminuria, overt
  nephropathy, and hypertension were significant predictors of
  cardiovascular mortality. Mortality in
  patients with microalbuminuria was only slightly increased compared with that
  in patients with normoalbuminuria. Median survival time after the onset of
  overt diabetic nephropathy was 13.9 years (95% confidence interval 11.8 to
  17.2 years). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormally increased urinary albumin excretion and
  other potentially modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, poor
  glycaemic control, and social class predict increased
  mortality in insulin dependent diabetes. Microalbuminuria by
  itself confers only a small increase in mortality. The
  prognosis of patients with overt diabetic nephropathy has improved, probably
  owing to effective antihypertensive treatment.
