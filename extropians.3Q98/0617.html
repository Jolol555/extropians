I have no idea what Randall R Randall really wrote, all I saw was a copy.</a>

<a href="0577.html#0617qlink1">        &gt;I am trying to argue that there must be continuity</a> of consciousness         </a><br>
<i>        &gt;to be sure that the uploaded one is the actual original </i><br>
<i>        &gt;consciousness, instead of a consciousness that was just created,         </i><br>
<a name="0639qlink4"><i>        &gt;while destroying the first.</i><br>

<p>
Perhaps true, perhaps not, it's irrelevant. Consciousness is obviously  
subjective so even if I stopped all your brain activity</a> for a billion years 
<a name="0639qlink5">and then restarted it there is no way you could tell internally,</a> you could 
<a name="0639qlink6">detect no gaps without observing the  outside world, so</a> your consciousness 
would be continuous.
<pre>
              
<br>
<a href="0577.html#0617qlink2">        &gt;you might need to simulate the entire structure to get consciousness </a><br>
          

</pre>
<p>
<a name="0639qlink8">Then simulate the mind, although "simulate" is not really</a> the correct word 
<a name="0639qlink9">when dealing with information, a calculator doesn't perform</a> simulated 
arithmetic.        

<p>
<a href="0577.html#0617qlink3">        &gt;I don't agree that the entire brain is required [to understand       </a><br>
<a name="0639qlink10"><i>        &gt;subjective experience].  Only specific memories are required,</a> those         </i><br>
<a name="0639qlink11"><i>        &gt;of you thinking about being conscious.</i><br>


</a>
<p>
Interesting theory, but as we're talking about consciousness not intelligence 
<a name="0639qlink12">or behavior, how will you ever know if you're theory is correct?</a>
                   

<p>
<a href="0577.html#0617qlink4">        &gt;if I could experience a memory of yours, then *that*  would         </a><br>
<a name="0639qlink14"><i>        &gt;be me experiencing being you, for the length of the memory, no?</i><br>


<p>
Books, music or a painting, give me a different subjective</a> experience than 
<a name="0639qlink15">these exact same things give you (I think), sometimes very different</a> (I think) 
<a name="0639qlink16">so why would you expect my memories to effect you the same way they do me?</a>

<p>
<a name="0639qlink17">There is an even deeper problem, the only reason I think the 6 year</a> old  
<a name="0639qlink18">John Clark is not dead, at least not entirely dead,</a> is that I remember being 
<a name="0639qlink19">him, if technology advances to the point (and it will) where</a> you can really 
<a name="0639qlink20">remember being me then you are  me, and Randall R Randall still has</a> no idea 
<a name="0639qlink21">what it's like to be John Clark.</a>

<a href="0577.html#0617qlink5">        &gt;If someone with plastic surgery and a really good imitation of you         </a><br>

<a name="0639qlink24"><i>        &gt;step into your life, would you? </i><br>

<p>
HELL NO, my momma didn't raise no dummies! The situation is not symmetrical 
<a name="0639qlink25">because the two act differently, one asks the other to sacrifice</a> himself but  
<a name="0639qlink26">the other asks no such thing, so the two "copies" can not</a> be anywhere close  
<a name="0639qlink27">to being identical. Let me propose a thought experiment of my own.</a>

<p>
<a name="0639qlink28">An exact duplicate of the earth, and it's entire ecosystem, is created 
a billion light years away. The duplicate world would need some sort of 
feedback mechanism to keep the worlds in synchronization, non</a> linear effects 
<a name="0639qlink29">would amplify tiny variations, even quantum fluctuations, into big 
differences, but this is a thought experiment so who cares.</a> In the first two
<a name="0639qlink30">cases below the results would vary according to personalities, remember 
there's a lot of illogic even in the best of us.

<a name="0650qlink1">  <li>  I know all about the duplicate world and you put a 44 magnum to my head 
<a name="0639qlink31">   and tell me in ten seconds you will blow my brains out, am</a> I concerned? 
<a name="0639qlink32">   You bet I am because I know that your double is holding an</a> identical gun 
<a name="0639qlink33">   to the head of my double and making an identical threat.
             
  <li>  I find out that for the first time since the Big Bang the worlds</a> will 
<a name="0639qlink34">   diverge, in 10 seconds you will put a bullet in my head but my</a> double will 
<a name="0639qlink35">   be spared, am I concerned? Yes, and angry as well, in times</a> of intense 
<a name="0639qlink36">   stress nobody is very logical. My double is no longer exact because</a> I am 
<a name="0639qlink37">   going through a traumatic experience and my double is not. I'd</a> be looking 
<a name="0639qlink38">   at that huge gun and wondering what it will be like when it goes</a> off and 
<a name="0639qlink39">   if death will really be instantaneous. I'd be wondering if</a> my philosophy 
<a name="0639qlink40">   was really as sound as I thought it was and I'd also be wondering</a> why I 
<a name="0639qlink41">   get the bullet and not my double and cursing the unfairness</a> of it all. 
<a name="0639qlink42">   My (semi) double would be thinking "it's a shame about</a> that other fellow 
<a name="0639qlink43">   but I'm glad it's not me".</a>
             
<a name="0639qlink44">  <li>  I know nothing about the duplicate world, a gun is at both our</a> heads and 
<a name="0639qlink45">   we both are convinced we're going to die. One gun goes off, making</a> a hell 
<a name="0639qlink46">   of a mess, but the other gun, for inexplicable reasons misfires.</a> In this 
<a name="0639qlink47">   case NOBODY died and except for undergoing a terrifying experience</a> I am 
<a name="0639qlink48">   completely unharmed. The real beauty part is that I don't even</a> have to  
<a name="0639qlink49">   clean up the mess.</a>

<p>
<a name="0639qlink50">The bottom line is we don't have thoughts and emotions, we</a> are thoughts and 
<a name="0639qlink51">emotions, and the idea that the particular hardware</a> that is rendering them 
<a name="0639qlink52">changes their meaning is as crazy as my computer making the meaning</a> of your 
<a name="0639qlink53">post different from what it was on yours.</a>
