<p>
You may think that, but it's not true. Again, any immortalist who trusts
governments to look after them is deluded.

<p>

<p>
<a name="0166qlink1">What, you mean people will cut their legs off? Tie them to the ground
and refuse to let them go? Nonsense. Most people won't move away, because
they don't think more than five seconds ahead. But there's no reason
why they're unable to do so; they merely choose not to.

<p>
And many of them will die as a result.</a>

The lesson, of course, is that if you want to live a long time you have
to think ahead and take action to reduce avoidable risks, not claim you
"can't" do something when you mean "won't".

<i>&gt;idea of weapons of mass destruction proliferating amongst irrational</i><br>

<i>&gt;suffering that could be caused requires more than a "so what?" response.</i><br>

<p>
Sure, it's bad, but so what? Crazies will use mass destruction weapons
against the unsuspecting here and there, and there's nothing we can 
really do but accept the risk and try to reduce the motivation for crazies 
to do such things. The problem with all the police state schemes suggested
as a way to prevent it is that they will encourage *more* people to 
attack. You don't solve a problem by making it worse.
