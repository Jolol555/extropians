<a href="2545.html#2556qlink1">&gt;Do you know if the Living Language series has a set for Irish?</a><br>
<i>&gt;(gaelic)</i><br>

<p>
Unfortunately not. I bought another brand for Irish (gaelic) and
that same brand has another version for Scottish (gaelic) these
unfortunately only come with two cassettes. I'm at the office
presently, I could send you the ISBN tomorrow. 

<p>
<a href="2545.html#2556qlink2">&gt;I too am attempting to learn this language....I really want to do</a><br>
<i>&gt;it in conjunction with my Mac....</i><br>

<p>
The CD's that came with the series are audio only, I've been very
dissapointed in the fact that I've yet to find any multimedia based
learning for languages, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place
(borders bookstore) Anyone have any other Info?

<p>
I would love to see a multimedia hyperlearning program like
this.....Hmmmm sounds like a business opportunity.
