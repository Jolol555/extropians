"No rational reason" is a strong claim. I doubt your claim. First, your
view surely depends on a Singularitarian view that superintelligence will
come all at once, with those achieving it pulling vastly far away from
everyone else. I don't expect things to work out that way. I've explained
<a name="1335qlink2">some of my thinking in the upcoming Singularity feature that Robin Hanson
is putting together for Extropy Online.</a>

<p>
<a name="1335qlink3">Second, I also doubt that the superintelligence scenario is so radically
different from today's powerful business people. [I don't say "businessmen"
since this promotes an unfortunate assumption about gender and business.]</a>
<a name="1335qlink4">You could just as well say that today's extremely wealthy and powerful
business should have no need to benefit poor people. Yet, here we have oil
companies building hospitals and providing income in central Africa.</a> I just
<a name="1335qlink5">don't buy the idea that each single SI will do everyone alone.</a>
<a name="1335qlink6">Specialization and division of labor will still apply.</a> at some SI's will
<a name="1335qlink7">want to help the poor humans upgrade because that will mean adding to the
pool of superintelligences with different points of view and different
interests.</a>

<p>
<a name="1335qlink8">Let me put it this way: I'm pretty sure your view is incorrect, because I
expect to be one of the first superintelligences, and I intend to uplift
<a name="1335qlink9">others.</a> Or, are you planning on trying to stop me from bringing new members
into the elite club of SIs?</a>

<p>
No disagreement there. Make money, invest it, and keep on integrating
advances as they happen.
