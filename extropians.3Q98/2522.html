<i>&gt;Walter Gehring of the University of Basel in Switzerland found a gene</i><br>

<i>&gt;vastly different mouse type eye, even though it was a mouse gene. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;gene must be a sentence in a language much more abstract than the</i><br>
<i>&gt;genetic code and it must say "build an eye here", but it doesn't bother</i><br>
<i>&gt;to say exactly how to build it. It can't deal with the billions of</i><br>
<i>&gt;different reactions in protein synthesis that must occur, it can't even</i><br>
<i>&gt;worry about gross anatomy, it just says "build an eye here" and leaves</i><br>
<i>&gt;the details to other parts of the cell mechanism. It's amazing that</i><br>
<i>&gt;organisms as different as a fly and a mouse, who's last common ancestor</i><br>
<i>&gt;lived 500 million years ago, nevertheless use the same high level</i><br>
<i>&gt;language. The much lower level genetic code is also universal, I guess</i><br>
<i>&gt;when nature establishes a standard it finds it almost impossible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;change.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2523qlink1">It's not a "higher level code" or anything like that.  The similarity
between different high-level developmental control genes just reflects
the extreme difficulty of changing anything essential to the organism's
survival.</a>

<p>
<a href="2520.html#2522qlink2">&gt;These genes are few in number but they're what makes us human, and they</a><br>
<i>&gt;must be written in the same abstract high level language that Gehring</i><br>
<i>&gt;found. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="2523qlink2">I hope Gehring didn't claim to have found an abstract high level
language in the genome, because he didn't.</a>  Anyway, it's not the
highly conserved genes that differentiate<a name="2523qlink3"> us from the chimp -
</a>
they don't distinguish us from anything.  It's almost a parlor
game with molecular biologists to stick human genes in things
like yeast and nematodes to show they still work.
