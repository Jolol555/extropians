<p>
<a name="0593qlink1">Yes.  As I grouped (and partially rephrased) them, the questions would look
like this:

<p>
GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSHUMANISM

<p>
What is transhumanism?
</a>
<p>
What is a posthuman?

<p>
Transhumanism and Nature

<p>
<a name="0593qlink2">Isn't transhumanism tampering with nature?

<p>
Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?</a>

<p>
<a name="0593qlink3">TRANSHUMANISM AS A PHILOSOPHICAL AND CULTURAL VIEWPOINT

<p>
What are transhumanism's philosophical and cultural antecedents, 
and how is it distinguished from other, similar ideas?

<p>
What prominent thinkers are associated with transhumanism?</a>

<p>
Is transhumanism a cult/religion?

<p>
<a name="0593qlink4">Won't things like uploading, cryonics and AI fail because 
they can't preserve or create the soul?

<p>
LIFE EXTENSION
  
<p>
Why do you want to live longer?

<p>
Isn't death part of the natural order of things?

<p>
Won't extended life spans cause overpopulation problems?

<p>
SOCIETY AND POLITICS

<p>
Won't new technologies only benefit the rich and powerful? 
What happens to the rest?

<p>
Shouldn't we concentrate on current problems like improving the
condition of the poor people or solving international conflicts,
instead of putting effort into foreseeing the "far" future?

<p>
What kind of society would posthumans live in?

<p>
Will these new technologies be used in war and might they cause 
our extinction?

<p>
How will posthumans or superintelligent machines 
treat humans who aren't augmented?

<p>
Do transhumanists think technology will solve all problems?

<p>
PRACTICALITIES AND THE TRANSHUMANIST PROGRAM

<p>
What evidence is there that it will happen?
</a> 
<p>
What is nanotechnology?

<p>
<a name="0593qlink5">All these transhumanist issues will not happen within a hundred years;
won't they will take more like a thousand years. (MNT, Uploading)</a>
 
<p>
<a name="0593qlink6">What if it doesn't work?

<p>
How could I become a posthuman?

<p>
Isn't the possibility of success (in cryonics) too small?

<p>
Will the people of the future be interested in restoring you?

<p>
What recent progress has been made towards transhumanist goals?

<p>
How can I become involved in transhumanism?</a>
