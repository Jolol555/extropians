hara ra, this approach doesnt really protect either privacy or protect
from data vandals.  consider my recent experience with the car shopping.
i could not find information on potential problems with a pickup truck i
liked, so i found a website.  many posts expressed concern over a new
feature of the 98 fords, that the transmission would not hold up under
the increased load.

<p>
then i saw a post that went something like:  im a texas cowgirl and i haul
my horses in a yakkity yak trailer and that trany is doing fine after bla bla
miles, etc.

<p>
well, as with extropians, she had the problem of a woman on a male
dominated group and they started sniffing.  (mmmmm, feeemaaaaale,
like truuuucks,  mmmmm)  {8^D  they asked about her horses, she
never responded.  well, if you know horse people, they love to talk
about their horses.  so now i suspect "she" was a ford dealer that
posted that, hoping to allay fears about the product.

<p>
the same problem would show up with the example i stated: how
to find the link between breast cancer and vitamin e.  spike
