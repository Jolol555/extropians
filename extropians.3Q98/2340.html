Oh, and on a related note:  Why Perpetual Progress?  Boundless Improvement
seems clearer to me, if only because you'll never see a debate topic:
"Resolved: Improvement is bad."

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Future markets</i><br>

<p>
While *I* understand what you mean, I would argue that your use of the term
"market" is not only at odds with my understanding of its definition, but
the working definition of most readers. :) A market is a decentralized
system for resource allocation, yes, but this is true in the same sense
that a square is a rectangle.  For example, Legg's proposed "neuronomy"
would certainly be decentralized, but it would be an abuse of the term to
call it a market.</a>

<p>
<a href="2331.html#2340qlink7">&gt;If this is favoring one particular technology, then it's an extremely general</a><br>
<i>&gt;kind of technology. I don't see that as much different from favoring the</i><br>
use of
<br>
<a href="2331.html#2340qlink8">&gt;reason as an effective means of knowledge, or optimism as a psychological</a><br>
<i>&gt;approach.</i><br>

<p>
I agree to the extent that I can't imagine a centralized system of resource
allocation that works better than a decentralized system.  This is why I
think "Spontaneous Order" is a great principle.  If there were another word
that meant "decentralized resource allocation systems of all kinds" then
I'd certainly throw in my support for that, but "markets," in my book, are
only one species of that particular genus.
