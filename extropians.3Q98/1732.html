mr. grimes. did you redefine 'truth' and 'honesty' while i slept? every
word i've seen you write on this list and off it is without a doubt the
most appaling and ridiculously large amount of bullshit i've seen for a
very long time.

<p>
you _demand_ an apology? would you apologize to a rabid dog for shooting
its head off?

<p>
being somewhat of an authority on cult movements and mind control
tactics of the same, i am shocked by your actions towards extropy
institure and this list. extropy as a cult could be nothing further from
the truth.

<p>
i strongly suggest that you start reading up on the subjects you claim
to know to much of, i'm quite certain that the objective litterature
could work its way even to your mind and give you some understanding of
what extropy and transhumanism is. if this should still be a problem, i
suggest that you seek psychiatric and maybe even medical attention
before continuing your daily life.

<p>
i cannot denamd that you get removed, this is a free list, any less than
you can demand anything from your position. i can assure you that my
attorney wouldn't touch this case from your view, although i'd like to
see someone try. you accuse nick bostrom of fabricating evidence,
doesn't fabricating evidence include that there is a court in session?
you claim not to be a criminal. that may be so, but that doesn't stop me
from wishing you would be locked up. judging from your postings, i'd say
you're dangerous.
