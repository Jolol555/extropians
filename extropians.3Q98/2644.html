<p>
<a name="2650qlink1">Asking Drexler has some obvious problems with bias.  Better to evaluate the 
arguments he presents.</a>  And to repeat myself again, to make a case for a rate
of change, you have to introduce time into your argument.  You have to say
how fast these opportunities would arrive and how fast they would be taken
advantage of.

<a name="2650qlink2"><a href="2640.html#2644qlink2">&gt;In short, I think there are big wins because I've looked a little beyond the</a><br>
<i>&gt;limits of my own mind ... these are ultimately the only reasons for believing</i><br>

<p>
Please don't attribute any disagreement to my failing to understand AI.
I think you will find that I can match any credentials you have in AI (or 
physics or nanotech for that matter).</a>  

<p>
<a name="2650qlink3"><a href="2640.html#2644qlink3">&gt;&gt; The question is *how fast* a nanotech enabled civilization would turn the</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; planet into a computer.  You have to make an argument about *rates* of change,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; not about eventual consequences.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If they can, if they have the will and the technology, why on Earth would they</i><br>
<i>&gt;go slowly just to obey some equation derived from agriculture?</i><br>

<p>
Economists know about far more than agriculture.  And you really need
a stronger argument than "I'll be fast because it's not agriculture." 

<p>
<a href="2640.html#2644qlink4">&gt;I've tried to articulate why intelligence is power.  It's your turn.  What are</a><br>
<i>&gt;the limits?  And don't tell me that the burden of proof is on me; it's just</i><br>
<i>&gt;your profession speaking.  From my perspective, the burden of proof is on you</i><br>
<i>&gt;to prove that analogies hold between intelligence and superintelligence; the</i><br>
<i>&gt;default assumption, for me, is that no analogies hold - the null hypothesis.</i><br>

<p>
If no analogies hold, then you have no basis for saying anything about</a> it.
You can't say it will be fast, slow, purple, sour, or anything else.  

<p>
<a name="2650qlink4">To me "superintelligent" means "more intelligent", and we have lots of 
experience with relative intelligence.  Humans get smarter as they live longer,
and as they learn more in school.  Average intelligence levels have been 
increasing dramatically over the last century.  Humanity as a whole is smarter
in our ability to produce things, and in scientific progress.  Companies get
smarter as they adapt to product niches and improve their products.  AI 
programs get smarter as individual researchers work on them, and the field
gets smarter with new resesarch ideas.  Biological creatures get smarter
as they develop adaptive innovations, and as they become better able to 
adapt to changing environments. 

<p>
All this seems relevant to estimating what makes things get more intelligent, 
and what added intelligence brings.</a>
