<p>
Humanity could be the first SI (that we know of). Humanity
has developed superior heuristics (scientific method), memory
capabilities (writing, information storage), information
processing speed (language, Internet), and data gathering (any
instrument of science).

<p>
The scientific community can be thought of as one massive
parallel computer to work on a vast number of issues simultaneously.
Guided by the rigorous (most of the times, that is) application
of the scientific method, the scientific community constantly
diagnosis its current knowledge base. The scientific community
constantly shifts resources to problems that are more complicated
and/or hold greater promise than others.

<p>
The AI and SI movements can be viewed as attempts to create more
efficient and robust nodes within the neural net of the scientific
community. Take that costly human physicist who works only 15 hours
a day and suffers from rigid heuristics after a few decades and 
replace him/her with a tireless research operating at superior
speeds and malleable heuristics.
