 Unfortunately, your ad hominem attack is
 inaccurate in truth. The company I work for
 processes mailing lists for several of these
 activist organizations, and I can tell you that
 the female members outnumber male members by a
 ratio of at least 4 to 1. Those are the facts,
 not 'arrogant sexist bullshit' as you claim.

I'm not so sure this stereotype doesn't have some basis in reality.  I am
unable to recall the particulars but I actually do remember studies that
determined that females were more attracted to "cute" faces.  Cute was
defined as faces with big eyes, large head to body ratios, and other
child-like attributes.  It may be rash to assume causation in this
particular case, but it may also be rash to hurl insults.
