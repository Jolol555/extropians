<a name="0399qlink1">This rocked my world, because longitudinal studies on gender 
reassignment occur about as often as blue mice:</a>

<a name="0399qlink2">Today's issue of the AMA Journal _Pediatrics_ 
contains a study that has the potential to radically alter the concept of 
immutable gender.  (It also raises some disturbing ethical questions 
the choice of the child involved)  It involves the second case of sex 
reassignment of a child who suffered an accident during a 
circumcision, who was then reassigned as a female.</a> This differs from 
the first case in that it was successful. Rather than 
try to explain it here, let me refer you to an online summary at:

The online _Pediatrics_ has not yet upgraded their website to show the 
new table of contents or any abstract of the study--I will post an URL 
when we find one.
