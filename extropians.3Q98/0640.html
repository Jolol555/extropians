Considering that

understand why

<p>
Certainly there is a great deal of hostility amongst some Quebecois towards
English-speaking Canada, though as yet there have been few acts of
violence.  Actually that's not quite true, in 1970 there *was* a Quebec
Liberation Front -- the FLQ -- that performed some kidnappings and at least
one murder. Since then, the violence has been mostly verbal/written.

<p>
Regarding your prediction about a new QLF, it might make an interesting
claim on the Foresight Exchange (<a href="http://www.ideosphere.com">http://www.ideosphere.com</a>). Care to draft
one?

<p>
<a href="0542.html#0640qlink9">&gt;&gt; I agree with this, but don't understand how individual gun ownership</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; logically follows from it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sorry if I boggle from what I see as an act of stubbornly purposeful</i><br>
blindness..

<p>
No apology needed. If I seem to be purposely blind, it's because I've found
that the most self-evident, "natural" truths are precisely those that
should be questioned from time to time. 

<p>
<a href="0542.html#0640qlink10">&gt;If all sovereign power comes from the individual, and sovereign powers (i.e.</a><br>
<i>&gt;nations) are recognised as having the right of self defense against</i><br>
agression,
<br>
<a href="0542.html#0640qlink11">&gt;then the individual has a right of self defense against agression.</a><br>

<p>
Agreed.

<p>
<a href="0542.html#0640qlink12">&gt;Since it is widely recognised that trying to uninvent technology through</a><br>
<i>&gt;legislation is a fruitless exercise, trying to ban guns only takes guns</i><br>
away from
<br>
<a href="0542.html#0640qlink13">&gt;law abiding individuals.</a><br>
<i>&gt;Therefore since agressors, criminals, are going to have guns whether or</i><br>
not they
<br>
<a href="0542.html#0640qlink14">&gt;are made illegal or not, disarming law abiding individuals is violating an</a><br>
<i>&gt;individuals right of self defense.</i><br>

<p>
Agreed, but where have I argued for gun control?  My argument has been that
it may not alwasy make sense for individuals to own guns.

<p>
<a href="0542.html#0640qlink15">&gt;Since it is also recognised that gun-control only removes guns from the</a><br>
hands of
<br>
<a href="0542.html#0640qlink16">&gt;civilians, not from the hands of the government, then the civilian</a><br>
population has
<br>
<a href="0542.html#0640qlink17">&gt;no means of fighting on an equal footing against a government which has</a><br>
become
<br>
<a href="0542.html#0640qlink18">&gt;malevolent due to the lack of oversight by the civilian population. In any</a><br>
state

<p>
"Lack of oversight" is generally a good thing; I think you meant "lack of
foresight" ;-&gt;

<p>
I question how well a civilian population armed with assault rifles etc.
could really resist government forces, given likely disparities in
weaponry, training, technology etc.  How many times has an armed citizenry
successfully resisted its government going totalitarian?  In the American
Revolution, I assume that most of the militias were at least initially
armed with private weapons (is this true?), but keep in mind that the army
they were fighting had an ocean between it and its major source of
reinforcements and supplies, and that another country (France) offered
assistance to the rebels.
