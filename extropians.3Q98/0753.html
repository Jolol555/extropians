<p>
Let me pursue my earlier examples, then.  When we last left our discussion,
I had described a set of computer systems.

<p>
<a name="0767qlink1">In one, we had a computer built out of double-thick components.  Each
wire and transistor took up twice the area which would normally be used.
You agreed, after we clarified the example, that cutting the area in half
would not result in anyone's death or the loss of anyone's consciousness.</a>

<p>
<a name="0767qlink2">Now let me re-propose the system above, but with a divider down the middle
of the double-width components, a divider which can be electrically switched
between conducting and insulating states.

<p>
When it acts as a conductor, the two sides are electrically connected and
we have</a> effectivelly the double-width circuit example above.  When it acts
as an insulator, the two sides are electrically separated and the system
acts like two circuits.  However, due to the fact that the two halves are
electrically identical, the two circuits stay synchronized at all times as
they operate.

<p>
Now, what will you say happens as we switch between the insulating and
conductive states for the divider which runs down the middle of each
circuit?  Would you view this as causing two instances of the computation
to run when it is insulating, while one instance runs when it is conductive?

<p>
<a name="0767qlink3">If the computation is a conscious program (an upload or AI), will this cause
a switch between two individuals and one?</a>

<p>
<a name="0767qlink4">If you think so, suppose you learn more about the circuit and discover that
the electric fields are such that electrons never actually cross the divider
even when it is in the conductive state.  They travel lengthwise down the
wires but there is no electric fields pushing them sidewise, hence they
never need to cross over the divider region.  So actually changing between
insulating and conductive does not change the behavior of any electron in
the system.  Their paths are unchanged.</a>

<p>
<a name="0767qlink5">Would you still think that making the divider insulating causes one
individual to become two?</a>

<p>
<a name="0767qlink6">How about if we can vary the divider's insulation smoothly between full
conductivity and perfect insulation?  Does it make sense to say that it
is possible for one person to _gradually_ become two?

</a>
<p>
Would these changes actually be perceptable to the person(s) involved?
<a name="0767qlink7">Would the consciousness feel any different as we switch between the two
cases?</a>

<p>
Thanks,

<p>
