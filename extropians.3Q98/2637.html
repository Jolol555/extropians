<a name="2651qlink1">This thread started when Eliezer referred to punctuated equilibrium
as support for his claim that future intelligence trajectories will 
mainly consist of big fast jumps between periods of little change.</a>  
For this purpose, the relevant question is how concentrated in time was
biological innovation.  And given the framework you describe, to answer
this we need to know both what fraction of biological innovation happens
from speciation, and just how fast speciation innovation happens.  

<p>
<a name="2651qlink2">Even if "the combined effects of the most important genes explains most 
of the variation between species", it is not clear to me that this implies
most biological innovation happens at speciation.</a>  And even for genes
<a name="2651qlink3">which do "follow the exponential model", the crucial question is "over 
how many orders of magnitude"?</a>
