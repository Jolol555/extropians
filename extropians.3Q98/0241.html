I've come up with my own memetic toolkit while fine-tuning my own skills in
discussing transhuman ideas, whether it is a one-on-one or public.  My own
toolkit is a first-hand, from scratch, and a blueprint that continues to
help me in spreading and engineering transhuman memes.

FAQ:


<OL>
  <li>  Listen:  Understand the context of the people I am communicating with
and their level of progress and rate of personal growth. People will let me
know, one way or the other, within the first few minutes who they are.

  <li>  Cost Benefit:  Discern if the time and energy is a productive and
successful exchange.  Is it worth my time and effort to communicate with
this person(s)?  (9 out of 10 it is.)

  <li>  Educate, Debate or Alienate:  What strategy do I employ?  Am I in this
to teach, argue or to rave about my own views?  How do I best want to
communicate.

  <li>  Critical Thinking and logically while monitoring information, getting
feedback, using error correction and accurate replay, and collision avoidance.

  <li>  Common Ground:  If people recognize something in common with me (skiing,
videomaking, gardening, psychology), then I do not appear to be so alien in
my transhuman views.  

  <li>  Historical Parallels:  people seem to be more receptive to new or
<a name="0320qlink1">challenging ideas if they are given concrete examples of events in history
have some bearing on what we are discussing.
</a>

  <li>  Patience: people develop at different rates, and this has value.  It is
a readiness and openness in someone's psychology that welcomes change.
Whether an early-bird or eleventh-hour, this process sometimes depends on
their psychological barometer.

  <li>  Ignite Curiosity: "Every question we answer leads on to another
question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species."
Desmond Morris;  "I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a
fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be
curiosity." Eleanor Roosevelt. 

  <li>  Humor!:  keeps tensions down, helps people relax, and there nothing so
welcoming as a smile.

  <li>  Meme engineering:  My favorite moment is when I actively ignite or
impart a positive or vivid impression of my extropian ideas and transhuman
culture
