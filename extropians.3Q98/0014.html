<a name="0015qlink1">True. But today a moderately educated crazie can buy enough ammonium

Eugene pointed out, terrorists doesn't seem to have the R&amp;D mindset,

generators (or whatever) become widely available in the stores. The
point is, you have to be able to move away *before* somebody starts

there is a real chance that it becomes a logical target.

<a name="0015qlink4">I think you miss my point in this thread: there is a real problem is
certain technologies of mass destruction become too available and
there are no good ways of protecting from them or avoiding them.</a> Which
technologies are going to become troublesome and how to deal with them
must be looked at on a case-to-case basis; some are much easier to
deal with than others, and we have different time to implement

the sand, hoping you have an escape before they become dangerous.</a>
