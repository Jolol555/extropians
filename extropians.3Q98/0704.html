Agreed. A dog is a dog is a dog, but a god is just a few exponential
steps off. If according evolutionary trajectory is kinetically
accessible: instant SI, just add ZOPS.

In terms of statespace velocity, the hardware has not progressed all that dramatically. 
The reason we _think_ the hardware has progressed so much beyond the
software is one of the current tradegies we have to live with. Why are 
people so intent on censoring their own worldview? Everything which
even distinctly smacks of von Neumann is wrong, Wrong, WRONG.

<OL>
  <li>  We're not archae, and we understand our hardware more or less
   thoroughly (or at least are just a few years off that stage). We
   don't have to retraverse all these GYrs.

  <li>  we can write our fitness function. Nothing prevents us from
   starting off with realtime robotics and Turing test performance,
   while optimizing for SPEED.

  <li>  evolution speed in EHW fitness space is nothing like precambrian
   ursoup simmering forever. Electronically excited Genotype2phenotype 
   generation iteration takes microseconds, not decades.


</OL>
<p>
To sum it up, if we do it right, I think we have excellent chances to
leap beyond our current status quo in a few bounds. Let's.
