Can they? I used to say that too, but I reflected a little bit on it 
recently and it's not so clear that that is the right thing to say. 
At any rate, read "prob one" and "prob zero" if you want -- you 
still get a heavy conclusion. Do you accept it? That sitting in your 
armchair you can ascertain that the probability that the 
universe is infinite is one? (And it's hard to see how this 
conclusion could be changed by any empirical evidence.)

<a name="1638qlink1"><a href="1607.html#1618qlink2">&gt;  let me explain what I mean by formalize.</a><br>

<p>
Ok, I'll make a stab</a> at it. (It's somewhat late here but 
curiosity drives me to stay up and watch Clinton address the 
nation.)

<p>
Within this framework I think one could state the DA as follows:

<p>
Suppose there are two possible worlds, W1 and W2. In W1 there are two 
consequtive states, S1 and S2; in W2 there is only one state, S1, 
whereafter the world ends.

<p>
There is one agent, a, in each of these possible worlds. a can be in 
state a(S1) or in a(S2).

<p>
The "possible states" for the a's states are: P(S1)={(S1, W1), (S1, 
W2)} and P(S2)={(S2, W1)}.

<p>
We can assume that the prior probabilities are equal for W1 and W2.

<p>
Suppose RH-now is a being in state S1. In S1 you have information I. 
Question: What is Prob(W1|I)?

<p>
Some would say 1/2. But the doomsdayer claim that that is to overlook 
the fact that you should conside RHnow as a random sample from all 
actual observer-moments. The doomsdayer defends this claim like this:

<p>
Consider a hypothetical agent, ah, which is like a but has a reduced 
information set I'. Suppose that relative to I', the possible states 
for a are {S1, S2}, and that RH-now 
<br>
thinks that the rational probabilities for ah are 

<p>
Probah(W1|I')=Probah(W2|I')=1/2.

<p>
But consider the conditional probability Probah(I' &amp; "a is in 
state S1"|W1). Suppose RH-now thinks that the rational estimate of 
this is 1/2. Then, by Bayes theorem, RH-now should think:

<p>
Probah(W1|I'&amp; "a is in state S1") &lt;1/2

<p>
But then, in the rational opinion of RH-now, Probah(W1|I)&lt;1/2, since 
I = I'&amp;"a is in state S1". Thus, if RH-now prescribes the estimate 
Prob(W1)&lt;1/2 for somebody just like him and with exactly the same 
information aas himself, surely RH-now should himself believe that 
Prob(W1)&lt;1/2!
