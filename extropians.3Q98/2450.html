I'm now considering the singularity to be more like a recursive insight.
A couple of examples may help describe what I mean. I live on a wild coast
of forest, farm and surf beach country and often rode horses with the local
hunt club. We had to chase after an aniseed bag in a drag hunt because
there is no longer any wild game here. During a hunt there are always groups
of horses that pull away from the rest, then there's the main bunch and
after them the group that can't jump go through the gates and then there's
the people on foot. At certain times it becomes social to partake of the
spirit cup and that's when almost everyone catches up, even the people
on foot took short cuts. And then it was off again. Those who rode at the
head of the main bunch and tried in vain fits and starts to play leap frog
with the leaders seemed to cause the most damage by egging on their timid
followers and they were always the most physically exhausted. I know.
<P>My second example is more surprising because it portrays a change in
the vernacular, (like when the illiterati started to call computers 'hard
drives'.) Last night I got a call from a friend of a friend who said his
computer needs programming and could I help. After a few questions I determined
that this fellow mortgaged his house and now owns a PC, way better than
one I've ever seen. I told him that his computer didn't need programming
but quickly realized that he did. His problem was that he was overwhelmed
by too much unfamiliarity and in every real sense it was his brain that
needed programming not the computer. Educators take note: I don't mean
book learning but actual hands on programming like flows to subroutines
and calls to peripheral drivers, etc.
<P>I just hope that the old adage of "the more things change the more they
stay the same" will help humanity overcome the lizard strategy of wriggling
away from an attack and leaving its tail behind.
