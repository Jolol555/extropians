I hope you'll all forgive me if I treat the list for a moment as an
intellectual resource to be plundered.  Specifically, I suddenly realised
that there's a bizarre hole right in the middle of my layperson's grasp of
elementary molecular biology.

<p>
<a name="1916qlink1"><a name="1915qlink1">Everyone knows that DNA is prey to mutations, most of them quickly edited
out by vigilant repair mechanisms, most of the rest neutral or bad news,
only a few improving the genes they happen to occur within.  But by what
chemical pathway do those mutations come about?  I'd always assumed that
most of them involved gross *deletions* of one or more nucleotide bases,
the implication being that the least dangerous deletion would knock out
three adjacent bases in one go (otherwise *all* the subsequent three-letter
codons are fouled).  However, many mutations occur at a single point.  The
classic instance is the change creating sickle cell anaemia, in which
position 6 in the 146 amino acid chain has valine instead of glutamic acid.
 Presumably this means that an adenine has been changed into a uracil (or,
in the DNA chain, into a thymine).  

<p>
But how the hell does the equivalent of a random impact do</a> that?
</a>

<p>
It struck me that this is about as obvious as finding that a WIFE can be
mistaken for a HAT.  Well, that a WIFE can be turned into a WIG.

<p>
I'd like to draw you little pictures of the bases at this point, but it's
too hard in email.<a name="1931qlink1">  My point is that this mutation calls for a purine
double ring to be changed deftly into a pyramidine single ring, with all
manner of small but precise replacements of Ns and Os and Hs.</a>  I'm sure
such things *can* happen by chance, but it looks as if it would have to be
either a cumulative process (ruled out by the way DNA copying occurs, I'd
imagine) or a strange event akin to four eccentrically-clad skaters running
into each other and rebounding, leaving the guy in the middle dressed in a
dinner suit.

<p>
Any advice for the perplexed?
