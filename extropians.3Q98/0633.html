You have a problem with that? Not only does private ownership of nukes seem
the obvious choice for 'national defence' in an anarcho-capitalist society
(e.g. Vernor Vinge's 'The Ungoverned'), but how exactly are you going to
stop people buying nukes if they want them?

<p>
And given that the US government has come close to nuking Russia by
accident several times and recent reports show that Russia came within
three minutes of nuking the US in 1995, governments are clearly not 
competent to own them.
