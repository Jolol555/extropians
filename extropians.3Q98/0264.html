<p>
We cannot determine whether your consciousness would remain intact by
experiment, or even thought experiment; if we are not feeling it, we can
only presume that consciousness exists when we observe intelligent
behavior.  Since the behavior would be the same, however, by that same
presumption we must conclude that the consciousness would remain and would
be the same.  If this presumption is not true, then we cannot presume that
anyone else is conscious either, because we aren't them.
