<i>&gt; this that is consistent with most people's concept of identity.</i><br>

<p>
No, you are presuming a viewpoint that I don't have.  I have no
requirement to remain conscious, as long as I don't stay unconscious
forever.

<p>
<a href="0902.html#0907qlink2">&gt; Can you clarify what features you</a><br>
<i>&gt; value in the biological Harvey Newstrom that will exist 24 hours from now</i><br>
<i>&gt; that might be missing from a copy, without using subjective classifcations</i><br>
<i>&gt; such as "it's me" or "it's perceptions are my perceptions"?</i><br>

<p>
I make no such claim.  The copies are identical.  Any feature that one
has, the other has as well.  I have no doubt that both copies are
equally "me" or equally the same by any scientific measurement.  I
merely claim that they are not the same individual.  If you let them,
they will both go out and lead two similar but different productive
lives.

<p>
<a href="0902.html#0907qlink3">&gt;  Do you mean anything by the word "transfer" here? I think that if you</a><br>
<i>&gt; could translate this last sentence into something that is potentially</i><br>
<i>&gt; falsifiable, we might be able to make some progress.</i><br>

<p>
A transfer move a single object from one location to another.  A copy
leave the original object in the original location, but creates an
identical object in a new location.  I am distinguishing between an
upload procedure that results in one copy, and a duplication procedure
that results in two copies.

<p>
<i>&gt; But given your</i><br>
<a href="0902.html#0907qlink4">&gt; current formulation, I'm unable to tell whether you want something</a><br>
<i>&gt; unverifiable (did your soul or vital force get transferred?) or whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientific analysis can potentially answer your concerns.</i><br>

<p>
You quoted my first paragraph where I rejected the claim that
consciousness would "jump from the original to the copy when the
original is destroyed" because "I see no scientific basis for this."  I
have always insisted on scientific analysis and reject claims that are
not falsifiable.

<p>
<a href="0902.html#0907qlink5">&gt;  How about imagining a process that disassembles X% of the atoms in</a><br>
<i>&gt; your brain and puts them back where they were a microsecond later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is the resulting person you or is it someone else?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Does the value of X matter? Does it matter if some of the atoms are</i><br>
<i>&gt; replaced by equivalent atoms from somewhere else?</i><br>

<p>
No problems here.  Even if the atoms are grossly out of position, but
the macro structure of cells are still replicated, I have no problem.  I
think you are trying to address viewpoints that I do not hold.

<p>
I think you are assuming, like others have, that my position is that
they copy is not "me" because it is somehow different.  This has never
been my position.  It is a misunderstanding, probably due to my own
inability to explain myself.  The original is "me".  The copy is "me".
They are identical and both are equally "me".

<p>
<a name="0976qlink1">My only objection has been the killing of the original.  This is not
based on any fault in the copy.  It is because I want the original</a> to
<a name="0976qlink2">continue to live.  I believe "Harvey Newstrom" is a viable person
capable of great things in the future.  If you duplicate "Harvey
Newstrom", there are now two "Harvey Newstroms".  I think both of them
can be great.  Left alone, they will both grow, experience and evolve.
Killing one of them because he is "no longer required" or "not
sufficiently unique to contribute anything new", is murder just as it
would be to kill any person for these kinds of reasons.  I think
duplicated people have the same rights as any person.</a>

<p>
This is what I mean when I say they are not the same person.  Left to
their own volition, they will go off experience different lives and act
independently.  I don't want either one of them killed.  If the intent
is not to duplicate people, then I suggest we find a way to move
consciousness without duplicating it.  Once we create independent and
viable beings, I don't think we should go back and kill them.

<p>
I hope this clarifies my position.
