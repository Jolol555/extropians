To clarify, I haven't said the singularity won't happen.  I've said
its proponents haven't clarified what it is or offered a coherent
argument in favor of it.  Hal mentions my pro-singularity argument:

<i>&gt;sometime in the next few decades, with a potentially even more dramatic</i><br>
<i>&gt;transformation a few years later.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course without a model for why such changes should occur, it is hard to</i><br>

I consider this trendline argument to be the strongest case I've heard
for something like a "singularity."  I give it substantial credence, but it
leaves a lot of uncertainty.  A theoretical model of this next big change
would add a lot more confidence, were it available.

<a name="2691qlink1">My best shot so far is to say that growth is now limited by the rate at
which labor populations can grow, a limit that will be eliminated with
uploads or AIs.  Growth would then be limited by the rate at which labor
</a>
can be made more productive, which would be the computer hardware
improvement rate if that was the main way labor then became more productive.
It might be worth trying to formalize this argument within the usual
economic growth models.
