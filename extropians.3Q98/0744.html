<p>
I'd be curious to hear why the Egyptians "felt" like they were in their
livers.  Was this really true for the average Egyptian?  In certain
relaxation/meditation exercises, one is instructed to relocate one's
consciousness to various parts of the body.  I could never do this, and
became acutely aware that I "felt" like "I" existed right behind my eyeballs
and couldn't really move.  Is that because I've always been taught</a> that's
where my brain is and it is the source of my consciousness?  Or is there
possibly a physiological reason for this phenomenon?
