<i>&gt; singularity and would have great use for an island nation with</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanism-friendly laws. This is of course true, but misses the</i><br>

<p>
No, I don't think I've missed the point, lines 4-6 acknowledge your
PR concerns.

<a href="0036.html#0201qlink2">&gt; Imo, the image is largely correct. Or at least it *should be*</a><br>
<i>&gt; correct. Right now there's way to little focus on the practical</i><br>
<i>&gt; side of facing the radical changes which we predict. Of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I know what you mean; the above libertarian-esque ideas have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been tainted by other groups, so we shouldn't talk about them</i><br>
<i>&gt; for PR reasons. Nevertheless, I think survival and prospering</i><br>
<i>&gt; are too fundamental goals to be compromised. If there's a way to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; our cake and eat it too (i.e. being a successful "survivalist"</i><br>
<i>&gt; group while keeping a "politically correct" image), then that</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be great, of course. Maybe it could be done by keeping</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "practical" institutions (if there ever will be any) at</i><br>
<i>&gt; least officially separate from the "educational" ones. In</i><br>
<i>&gt; any case, all our eggs should not be in one basket.</i><br>

<a name="0219qlink1">Some key points are:
<br>
<a name="0314qlink1">--Image may be important, but ultimately what counts is survival
and flourishing. The actual goals should not be compromised too
much for PR reasons (this reminds me of the story of the three pigs
</a>
and the big bad wolf; pigs one and two don't take the Coming of the
Wolf (Singularity/Y2K/WW3 etc) too seriously, and make their houses
of bad materials. The wise survivalist pig takes a lot more trouble
to build a solid house, and doesn't give in to peer pressure from
the other pigs, that scoff at his work. Of course we all know what 
happens afterwards... ;-)

<p>
<a name="0314qlink2"><a name="0279qlink1">--Right now, there are hardly any projects (that I'm aware of) that
deal with the practical side of facing the future. Ideally, there
</a>
would be a transhuman network that could at least partially survive
a collapse of society. I know, it sounds paranoid, but when your
goal is immortality, and you live on earth, you *better* be "paranoid".
Also a &gt;H network of this kind would have many useful spinoffs such
as suspension facilities and community forming. One thing that would
certainly be needed is a radio network: in case of some disaster
the net would be one of the first things to go.
</a>
</a>

<p>
<a name="0314qlink3">--Apart from major disasters etc, there are the problems of everyday
life. Since money can buy you just about anything, including health, 
hapiness and life extension, it should be a major point on the 
transhuman agenda. Wealth is essential for survival and flourishing.
</a>

<p>
<a name="0314qlink4"><a name="0279qlink2">--If you want a "clean" image *and* the practical "survivalist" stuff,
you need to create separate organizations. There are already several
educational organizations (WTA, ExI, WFS etc) but none that deal 
specifically with the practical side of transhumanism: how can we 
maximalize our chances to survive and flourish in the twilight of 
humanity and beyond? Such an organization would most likely be
low-profile, since others do the message-spreading, and would 
mostly draw members from within the transhuman community. Touchy
but practical (or just interesting) issues would be handled on 
a separate list.

<a href="0193.html#0201qlink3">&gt; I don't want us to become politically correct. I don't want</a><br>
<i>&gt; self-censorship. But I want the ability to explain clearly and</i><br>
<i>&gt; rationally, and the ability to swallow the worst blunders before you</i><br>
<i>&gt; say them. Think of what you are saying and how people will react to</i><br>
<i>&gt; it!</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0279qlink3">The problem is, if we were to chat on this list so that it is 
acceptable and understandable to most people, the discussions
<a name="0270qlink1">would be, um, rather lame. I've said it before, and I'll say it
again: what we need is a private list, where one can speak freely. 
Censorship is bad for any conversation...
