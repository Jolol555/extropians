I think Hal explains it very well. I just want to add<a name="1638qlink2"> that if we try 
to apply the DA to other classes of objects we have to be careful.</a> 
(Astrophysicist Richard Gott, who independently discovered the 
doomsday argument, calls this general argument form 'the delta t 
argument'.) We have to make sure that we are not neglecting some 
underlying correlation. For example, when I explained the DA to one 
friend, he asked: "So I should expect that that tree over there will 
live approximately as long as it has already lived?" Well, that 
doesn't follow. The reason that tree was selected was that it was big 
and salient. The young trees in the garden did not have the same 
chance of being selected.
