<a name="1295qlink1">I didn't feel like copying that entire conversation, and I think you've all
set it to memory anyway, so this is my thought...

<p>
I would have to agree.<a name="1301qlink1">  To my knowledge, I haven't really even met one girl
who supports the Transhumanist way of thinking.</a>  Inversely, the majority of
<a name="1301qlink2">girls that I know that DO have a different philosophy</a> are in fact Wiccan.
<a name="1301qlink3">This is a philosophy that is more in tune with nature, and very</a> few Wiccans
<a name="1301qlink4">have a love for technology.</a>  In fact, I haven't met one that does like
<a name="1301qlink5">technology, and just about every Wiccan I've met (they've all</a> been girls, by
<a name="1301qlink6">the way, though I do know that there are male Wiccans) abhors the basic
transhumanist idea.</a>  Perhaps this says something about the difference in the
thought patterns of the sexes.  I am not a sexist by the way, but it is pretty
obvious that most men and women think differently.  I feel that you will all
agree with me on this.
