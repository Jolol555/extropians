Why bother with sonar when you could map greyscale visual the same
way.  Then you could use sonar strictly for range finding if the
visual was not stereo.  I think someone mentioned before that the
bottom of the feet seem to have a large sensitivity area in the brain
- what a waste, except for when your getting a foot rub, of course ;)

Yes, most people are third eye blind ;)

<a name="2738qlink1">My invention for near current tech augmentation go like this:

<p>
vision blocking Video headset - (soon to be replaced</a> with contact lens?)
<a name="2738qlink2">Stereo cameras on outside of headset
<br>
eye focus sensing device - knows current position of focusing muscle
electronic focusing system</a> for cameras

<p>
All focusing of the world around you is no longer needed by the
unconscious control of your focusing muscle (medical term anybody?). 
Instead, focusing is done electronically on the "camera side".  Also,
the position of your focusing muscle is compensated for on the
"display side" in real time so that your muscle position becomes
irrelevant for normal vision.  Now, you are free to retrain the
unconscious control of this muscle for some arbitrary other task.  My
favorite choice would be zoom control.  Eventually, you could zoom in
on things as a totally unconscious decision.  The end result is that
we've taken an unconsciously controlled muscle and automated its
normal functionality with current tech, freeing it up for other
utility.  All I want to do, is do a Zoom, Zoom, Zoom ;)
