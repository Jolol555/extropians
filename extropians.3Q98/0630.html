It's nothing of the kind; if we're concerned with saving lives and there's
a strong correlation between lack of freedom and suicide rates, then any
attempt to reduce the number of murders by creating massive police states
is going to increase the death rate even if it succeeds at reducing the
number of murders.

<a name="0649qlink1"><a name="0635qlink2">According to those WHO figures the suicide rate in Denmark was almost
three times as high as the US, and four times as high as the US murder
rate. So a Dane was four times as likely to kill themselves as an American
to be murdered, and about twice as likely to die a violent death (either 
murder or suicide) as an American.</a> Other Scandinavian countries were 
not far behind.</a>

<p>
Doesn't this disturb you? That Danes hate their lives so much that
they're three times as likely to kill themselves as Americans?
