jf, i read your site.  interesting but they failed to deal with a
subcategorythat i am wondering about: those who voluntarily give up all
privacy for some special purpose, such as advancing medical
science, for instance.  im neither poor nor rich, but i have nothing
to hide from anyone, not one thing.  i would post on a website
my every paycheck and purchase, if a group were formed for some
special purpose to do that for some good reason.

<p>
for instance, there was an article yesterday in the news that said
there is a direct correlation between personal income and longevity.
this is not hard to understand for the poor: they might neglect medical
care while trying to eke out a living, but the study showed that there
was no point at which the curve leveled out.  if a group</a> of extropians
were to want to learn why, and formed a group that was willing to
reveal eeeeeeverything, well, for that im willing to strip myself
naked, financially.  spike
