I think you and I are the only extropes in town, AP, but still...  It's a
talk at the Roden White library, 2nd floor of the Union, at 1 pm.

Did an interesting stint at the Victorian International Writers' Festival
yesterday, a place crowded with the great and the good doing their annual
presentations-of-self.  I was on a panel about the limits of science with
Paul Davies and a microbiologist/novelist zanie named Sally Morrison.  I
spoke on matters Spikish, emphasising the prospect of extended longevity.
To my surprise and delight, most of the questions afterward were for me -
many of them incredulous, naturally, but all intrigued by the transhuman
ideas.

<p>
And the latest issue of *Eureka Street*, an Aussie public affairs/cultural
journal published by, of all bodies, the Jesuits, has a substantial piece
by me on the Spike and the promise of nanotechnology.  It's possible to get
the memes churning out there, people, via the oddest vectors...
