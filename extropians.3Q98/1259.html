The spacecraft is already "just kinda" in free fall.

<p>
A ballistic object moving sideways at a speed at or above five miles
a second never hits the earth because the Earth's surface "falls" at at 
least the same rate the object does (no fair pointing the object so it
hits).

<p>
Every gram of propellant you orbit has to be accelerated to 5 or
more miles a second. That's expensive. Remember $10,000 a pound?
And then, 5 miles a second of of delta vee would necessitate a very
large amount of propellant having been orbited per gram of ship returned.
Somebody (Michael?) work the numbers here--I'm too tired.

<p>
If you have a beanstalk, you can get to orbit for not much more than the
cost of electricity; and you can go up or down as slowly as you please.
Good luck building the beanstalk.
