<a name="1529qlink1"><a href="1500.html#1514qlink1">&gt; Robin Hanson has an interesting argument that factual</a><br>
<i>&gt; disagreements should not persist. However I think it</i><br>
<i>&gt; took as one of its premises that people believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt; others are basically rational. If that is the case then</i><br>
<i>&gt; over time people should modify their beliefs in the face</i><br>
<i>&gt; of persistent disagreement.  Disagreements about factual</i><br>
<i>&gt; matters should not be stable. </i><br>

<p>
<a href="1500.html#1514qlink2">&gt; What if people hold the contrary belief, that there are</a><br>
<i>&gt; significant numbers of other people who are stubbornly</i><br>
<i>&gt; irrational? It would seem that we might have a stable</i><br>
<i>&gt; outcome similar to what we actually see: people collecting</i><br>
<i>&gt; into subgroups with shared opinions, where they believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; other members of their group are rational (at least on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; issue!). However the existence of significant groups with</i><br>
<i>&gt; other opinions does not lead them to change their ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt; because they simply assume that the others are irrational.</i><br>

<p>
I cannot speak for others, but I certainly hold</a> the latter
belief myself--that the vast majority of humans on Earth
are indeed stubbornly irrational, and that I am a better
judge of facts than even the most educated ("education" as
practiced today, after all, is merely indoctrination into
the currently popular prejudices).

<p>
Not only would that serve to stabilize disagreeing factions,
but also the fact that there exists a vast cosmos of facts
that are simply unknowable/untestable with present technology,
for which reason--even perfect reason--simply cannot supply
answers.  Every discovery that answers a question creates 10
more questions, so there is a vast universe of ignorance with
<a name="1532qlink1">only a few specks of knowledge that reason can verify.  I see
no reason why disagreement about facts in that great unknown
should cause any discomfort to reasonable people.</a>
