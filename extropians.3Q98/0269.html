In that case, perhaps you could give a real, actual, example of a terrorist
group who are attacking a government for being *too free*, and who are not
government-funded.

The only example that springs to mind would be Islamic attacks in Egypt,
but I'm not sure that they fit into that category since I know little
about the situation there. Also they seem to be targetted at visitors,
not the locals, which complicates matters.

Yes. This is one reason why government is bad and should be eliminated.

My conception of individual rights does not include a government, so that's
not a problem.
