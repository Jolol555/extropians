I can already hear the pro-gun responses:
</a>

<p>
"Yeah, but until they figure out how to stamp our APDs . . . arm everyone!"

<p>
I know it doesn't address short-term issues and I'm not against owning a
gun, and if it does come down to you or him . . . let it be you.  I just
don't think that more guns is going to make the problem go away.
