There is no quick fix.  As the economy grows, so will everyone's spending
power.  The only quick change we can make to get people employed is to
eliminate the minimum wage.  Beyond that, all we can do is to continue to
invest.  By that I mean investment in the very broad sense of the term:
taking a loss today so that you can earn back more than you lost in the
future.  There are a lot of ways to do this: you can invest in new homes,
new machines, new people, and you can also invest in new forms of social
organization like anarcho-capitalism (which, I predict, will be harsh in
its first few years, but better for all in the long term, and thus a good
investment).  But in the end, investment is the only thing that will ever
raise the quality of life for the disadvantaged.
