To me this model suggests the opposite conclusion.  The full time job of 
children is to understand the adult world around them, and they pretty
much all succeed at it.  When they do, we call them adults.  That
suggests that if we put in sufficient time into the effort, we can 
understand posthumans.  The analogy would also suggest that 
succeeding in the effort would make us posthumans, but this only goes
through if humanity were spending full time at this effort.  But in
fact humanity now spends only the tiniest fraction of its time trying
to envision posthumans.  So by this analogy we should be able to spend 
more time to get better understanding without hitting any obvious limits.
