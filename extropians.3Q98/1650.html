Why would anyone on this list address the questions of what appears to be a
false persona? Why are you afraid to ask these questions as yourself? Your
false identity makes your motives suspect.  I don't think you'd have any
shortage of responses if you'd simply drop the charade. Perhaps it *would*
be useful to ask ourselves, "What are the socially redeeming attributes of
Extropianism.", but I for one would not be interested in engaging the
Jenny-persona in that conversation. Additionally, your satiric attack
appears to be aimed primarily at Max.  This sounds suspiciously personal
rather than ideological.  Come clean Jenny.
