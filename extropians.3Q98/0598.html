<p>
I think that FAQ pertaining to "culture" should be its own category with
Transhumanist Art, and the various genre's of this period.  Please keep in
mind with this that Transhumanist Art is of the modes of transhuman
creative innovations and openly is the only art period that represents the
confluence of art and science.

<p>
Thus, I would not include culture with philosophy, but culture and the
arts.  This is in part due to historical reasons (art and culture are
recognized to go hand in hand by traditionally, making it easier for
newcomers); and my own views that art influences culture and vice versa.  

<p>
"Transhumanist Art and Transhuman Culture"<br>

<p>
This would possibly include the FAQ on the Transhumanist Art web site, as
well as questions about augmenting creativity, automorphing (ourselves: our
behavior, bodies, and A-Life).  I would keep it simple, but would not leave
out what is important in explaining it cogently.
