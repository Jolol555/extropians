Abstract
<br>
  OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of adding barley bran
  flour and a barley oil extract to a fat-modified diet on
  serum lipids in persons with hypercholesterolemia. DESIGN:
  The basic design of the study was a randomized, 30-day intervention trial. It
  included a neutral-fiber control group and a 1-week preintervention period
  for the collection of baseline data. SUBJECTS: The subjects were 79 men and
  women with hypercholesterolemia. Subjects had a mean age of
  48.2 years, and all completed the study. INTERVENTION: All participants were
  instructed to follow the National Cholesterol Education
  Program (NCEP) step 1 diet and were randomly assigned to one of three
  treatment groups: 20 g added cellulose, 3 g added barley oil
  extract, or 30 g added barley bran flour. MAIN OUTCOME
  MEASURES: Total serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol (LDL-C), and very-low-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol were measured, along with serum triglycerides,
  before the intervention, at week 1, at week 3, and at the end of the
  intervention. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Student's paired t test was
  used to detect significant changes within each treatment group from baseline
  to the end of the 30-day intervention. In addition, Pearson's correlation
  coefficients were used to detect significant correlations between the
  variables measured. RESULTS: Addition of barley bran flour
  significantly (P = .0001) decreased total serum cholesterol
<br>
  (-0.60 mmol/L) as did addition of barley oil (-0.50 mmol/L;<br>
  P = .002) after 30 days of intervention. Similarly, LDL-C decreased 6.5% with
  addition of barley bran flour (P = .036) and 9.2% with
  addition of barley oil (P = .003). Total serum
  cholesterol or LDL-C of the cellulose control group did not
  decrease significantly over the same period. HDL-C decreased significantly in
  the cellulose control group and the barley bran flour group
<br>
  (-0.15 mmol/L, P = .012, and -0.15 mmol/L, P = .006, respectively), but not<br>
  in the barley oil group. CONCLUSION: We conclude that
  addition of barley bran flour or barley oil
  enhances the cholesterol-lowering effect of the NCEP step 1
  diet in individuals with hypercholesterolemia.
