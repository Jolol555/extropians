<p>
don't forget music generated by microprocessors! Kraftwerk, Jean
Michelle-Jarre, techno, house, Caberet Voltaire, Deep Forest, HipHop
<br>
(yes HipHop, it does a great job of describing the modern urban<br>
experience through electronically produced music, giving modern urban
dance culture a frame of reference)
<br>
AirLiquid, RoniSize ('change my life....') the Orb, anything really on
the Astralwerks record label.
<br>
<a name="0257qlink1">The techno explosion is all about cheap disposable, recycleable, music
made by the microprocessor/human interface. This is the folk music of
</a>the future. Is is the driving, pounding soundtrack to the information
age. Passionate and dispassionate, pretty and sterile, virtual and
<a name="0257qlink2">virtuoso. Everything that technology promises</a> to be. Slapping soulful
<a name="0257qlink3">house lyrics on top of clinically accurate beats is like slapping XML on
top of HTML. Having eerie spacey synth pads play over distorted
energetic breakbeats is like a cold ATM in a local fruit market.</a> The
<a name="0257qlink4">replacement of jazz for acid jazz, roomfuls of violinists for a sampler,
a conducter, orchestrator and composer for MIDI, virtual concerts via
the internet instead of huge concert halls all represtent the
digitizing, 'uploading' if you will of our common cultural aesthetic.
