It's also true that some say "Smarter" creatures lie and cheat and extort more
often. For example, Robin, I suspect you're not writing on this list for the fun of
it and there are some people's opinions that conflict with yours and to which you do
not reciprocate. Why is it then that you are unable to command any monetary value
for this labor of yours? I thought the labor theory of value went out with Marx and
his ilk.
