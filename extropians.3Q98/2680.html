that used different survey methods to obtain their data be both more
useful and be able to give you both privacy and highly valid data just
not simultaneously.

<a name="2730qlink4">Example: Advertise ( through banner ads on the Internet Link Exchange
for example) for individuals to become members of a list of potential
survey recipients (email addresses) then choose from that list at
</a>
random. Mail each selected participant a form (an ordinary e-mail doc
with an embedded html doc that contains in its html code a validation
number perhaps) that they fill out and return by e-mail. No one can
submit more than one copy and by stripping out the html doc from the
e-mail there is no way to connect the data with the participant. That
system is admittedly imperfect since it requires that the participants
trust that the survey administrators actually divorce the html doc from
the e-mail address. That would however give you a one submission per
person database for those folks who did have enough trust. Make the
database size significant. That database could be used as a key to help
validate a larger ongoing database to which anyone could contribute
simply by filling out a form on a website.
