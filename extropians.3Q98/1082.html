I too find such claims suspect--they seem to be prime cases of post hoc,
ergo propter hoc.  One could probably find as much "evidence" for a
</a>
connection between Coca-Cola consumption and smaller families.

<p>
I suspect memetic influence is the likely causal factor, rather than
wealth.  We need look no farther than Madison Avenue to find memetic
attacks targeted at the well-to-do.

<p>
<a name="1088qlink2">Also, my imperfect knowledge of history leads me to believe that the
connection between wealth and smaller families is one which doesn't</a> go back
that far.

<p>
OTOH, the rich family that has lots of kids ends up dividing the pie a lot
of ways, ofttimes enough to disqualify the offspring from the "rich" title.
 If a significant percentage of the "rich" get that way by inheritance,
then the state of being "rich" will tend to evolve small families....

<p>
As nature doesn't measure wealth in dollars, I suspect this isn't a good
trade in the long run.
