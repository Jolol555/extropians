&lt;&lt; So it *is* a genetic glitch which would normally prevent reproduction,
 but it [the gen glitch] was/is suppressed by intolerant societies that
 force gays to "keep up appearances" by marrying, having kids etc.). In
<br>
<a href="0564.html#0579qlink1"> *liberal* societies "nature can take its course", and reproduction is</a><br>
 generally prevented since the gay person is not forced to mate with the
 opposite sex, and doesn't feel the biological urge to do so. &gt;&gt;

<p>
All this stuff about a glitch... In a world with a population problem, I'd
think we'd welcome folks who are productive in every way save the addition of
more people... But that's just me I guess...
