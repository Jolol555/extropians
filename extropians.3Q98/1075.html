<a name="1082qlink1">On Damien B.'s cue, I'll say I think Max's "inevitable" claim is too strong. 
There is nothing economically inevitable about wanting to have fewer</a> kids when
<a name="1082qlink2">you're rich; it's a matter of preferences.  And there are in fact a minority
of rich folks who seem to prefer large families, and whose kids do too.</a>  

<p>
Our current world is very different from the world human preferences were 
selected for.  For some reason I'm not clear on, our evolved preferences and 
behaviors seem to choose to have fewer kids under "industrialized" situations.
But this behavior doesn't seem adapted to our new world.  It sure seems like
those who prefer larger families when rich should be eventually selected for.

<p>
Of course with human reproduction beingh as slow as it is, such selection takes 
time, and by the time it really starts to bite the world will change even more 
drastically.  I have written elsewhere about how I expect very strong selection 
effects with uploads.
