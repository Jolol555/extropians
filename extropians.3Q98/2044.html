30 seconds later!  This seems nonsensical, since
it implies that the death of people goes on all the
time, inevitably (and that therefore the sudden 
termination of someone's body is nothing to get
excited about).
<br>
You keep saying that because they are in different
states of mind (one terrified, one complacent), that 
they are radically different, and I don't see that.  I was
terrified last night (close auto accident), but I am not
a substantially a different person today because of
it.
