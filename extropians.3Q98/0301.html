<a name="0315qlink1">This kind of discussion reminds me of one of my favorite SF series; Michael
Moorcock's "Dancers at the end of time". The stories have a lot in common
with Banks' "Culture" in that they're basically about a bunch of transhumans
who have lots of power and lots of free time, but seen from a sixties or
seventies perspective. Although the stories aren't terribly well-written, 
I think that much of their behaviour -- for example indifference to 
'lesser' beings (e.g. human time-travellers are put in zoos and traded 
like pets) -- seems quite true to life; they don't care much about humans,
because in general they're not really regarded as 'people'.
