<a name="2144qlink1">Sorry, I haven't even looked at this ISEW thing and wouldn't intend to look at
any system that uses capitalism's paper money as a circular measurement.</a> I say
again use an Ingrid system that separates all elements into clusters so that
there can be no value for each element on any particular scale greater than 5
nor lower than 1 and you will automatically create a spontaneous self-adjusting
global AI. We have the computing power right now and what I'm saying can be
modeled. Are you against designing such an economic model and putting it through
its paces?
