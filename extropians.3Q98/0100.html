"Specific Patterns of Food Consumption and Preparation are Associated With
Diabetes and Obesity in a Native Canadian Community"

<p>
Abstract:

<p>
  We examined the relationship between usual patterns of food intake,
fattiness of food preparation and consumption, and diabetes and obesity
status in a Native Canadian reserve in northwestern Ontario. Patterns of
intake were estimated using a 34-item food frequency instrument. Scales and
scores were developed using factor analysis procedures and were tested for
reliability using coefficient alpha. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)  and
diabetes status was determined by administering a 75-g glucose tolerance
test. A number of the food groups appear to have a protective effect in
regard to IGT and diabetes, including vegetables [odds ratio OR=0.41],
breakfast foods (OR=0.41) and hot meal foods (OR=0.29). Most of these foods
are relatively high in fiber and low in fat. High consumption of junk foods
and the bread and butter group was associated with substantial increases in
risk for diabetes (OR=2.40; OR=2.22). These foods tend to be high in simple
sugars, low in fiber and high in fat. More fatty methods of food
preparation are also associated with increased risk for diabetes in this
population (OR=2.58). This information has been incorporated into an
ongoing commmunity-based diabetes program in the community.

Additional quote from text:

<p>
  Of the different types of fat reportedly used in preparation and added
for consumption, only lard showed a significant relationship with
individual health status. The most frequent users of lard were over twice
as likely to have diabetes or to belong to the combined diabetes/IGT group.
