<p>
And:

<a href="0793.html#0873qlink3">&gt; Both of you point to your left and see the other</a><br>

<p>
And then attempted to ask some questions to
determine why you thought they would diverge when
I had clearly stated they experience exactly the
same thing (many times), to which I got:

<p>
<a href="0806.html#0873qlink4">&gt; I never claimed a divergence in what they see.</a><br>
<i>&gt; I claimed a divergence in which wall they point</i><br>
<i>&gt; to. They are not pointing toward the same wall.</i><br>

<p>
And:

<p>
<a href="0817.html#0873qlink5">&gt; During the upload discussion, many people</a><br>
<i>&gt; claimed that if two objects were identical</i><br>
<i>&gt; except for location, that they were the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; object.</i><br>

<p>
And:

<p>
<a href="0850.html#0873qlink6">&gt; Some people on this list disagree that there can</a><br>
<i>&gt; be more than one of any identical objects.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; seem to count one body, one brain, one wall, one</i><br>
<i>&gt; hydrogen atom, as long as they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; indistinguishable.</i><br>

<p>
Anyway, you wrote:

<p>
<a href="0864.html#0873qlink7">&gt; &gt; As far as I can tell, you believe the walls</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have an independent location.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why?  Don't you?  You agreed above that there</i><br>
<i>&gt; are four walls.  Are you now claiming that all</i><br>
<i>&gt; four walls are in the same location?</i><br>

<p>
No, I am claiming their location is relative to
other walls (and objects) in the room. For
instance, the left-hand wall is 10 feet from the
right-hand wall, and so on.

<p>
<a href="0864.html#0873qlink8">&gt; If you are not claiming this, why are you asking</a><br>
<i>&gt; me to prove that they are different?</i><br>

<p>
Because that is what this entire debate is about,
can you prove the walls are different? Can you
even know the walls are different? You point to
the left-hand wall and your copy does the same,
you see your copy pointing to the right-hand wall
and your copy sees the same.

<p>
<i>&gt; Do you not agree that they are different, or are</i><br>
<a href="0864.html#0873qlink9">&gt; merely exercising my proof system to see how I</a><br>
<i>&gt; define location?</i><br>

<p>
I'm simply trying to find out where you think the
copies will diverge. If they point to the
left-hand wall and see their copy point right and
think, "he's pointing to the wrong wall" there's
still no divergence. This I think, you now
understand.

<p>
<a name="0875qlink2"><a href="0864.html#0873qlink10">&gt; They will therefore diverge in thought, deed,</a><br>
<i>&gt; or experience.  The two people will think</i><br>
<i>&gt; differently, act differently, or experience</i><br>
<i>&gt; differently.  They cannot remain identical.</i><br>

<p>
So if we've established that they will not diverge
in thought, deed, or experience, can they act</a> as
redundancy?

<p>
Even though you say you'd agree to being uploaded
"atom by atom" (I'm not quite sure how this would
work in the context of uploading) once you're
on-line it's likely you'll be prone to the usual
computer techniques of back-ups, redundancy and
time-sharing.
