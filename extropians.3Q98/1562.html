I lost your original message to a %$@#&amp;%* Netscape
error, but I think I got the general drift from
later responses. I suspect we're basically talking about two
different things, with IMO different "danger"
levels. My concerns weren't as much about servant AIs turning
mean, but rather ruthless *people* turning SI trough
future technology (AI, nanotech, uploading etc.)</a> If
<a name="1590qlink2">(and this is only logical) the abovementioned technologies
will remain long enough (almost) completely within
the realm of governments, big corporations, criminal
organizations and the ultrarich for these people to
understand and use their full potential, we're all
screwed.
