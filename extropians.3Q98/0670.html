Good point.  I stand corrected.<a name="0692qlink6">  So the only difference is your memory?
Your definiton of whether shooting someone in the head depends on what
data is stored in their memory?</a>  This seems a weak basis for my tastes.

<a name="0692qlink7">So killing the one body is not murder, but killing the other body that

viability.

<a href="0659.html#0670qlink2">&gt; There is no alternative. If one copy has been terminated I can't measure</a><br>

<p>
This seems to be the flaw (in my opinion) with your argument.  You kill
one person and therefore ignore his desire to live because he now has no
opinion.  This is true with any dead body.  My point is that right now,
before I die, I know that I am against it.  I don't think we can merely
discount the wishes of the people we kill just because after they're
dead they no longer wish to live.

<p>
<a href="0659.html#0670qlink3">&gt;         &gt;You seem to think that it is OK for one copy to die if the other</a><br>

<i>&gt; Yes.</i><br>

<i>&gt;            </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, because the poor horrible cripple does have a viewpoint.</i><br>

<p>
Here again<a name="0692qlink8"> you seem to indicate that by killing someone, they lose their
viewpoint, and therefore their desire doesn't count.  It seems that I
could argue the same thing and kill you right now.  You have not copies,
and you might not want to die, but after I do it you won't have a
viewpoint so it won't matter.</a>

<a href="0659.html#0670qlink4">&gt;         &gt;If one of them were in pain, and it bothered you, would killing</a><br>

<i>&gt; Obviously.</i><br>

<p>
Remind me not to ask you for help if I am in pain...  But seriously, I
think we understand each other's views enough to predict them.  We just
wouldn't choose those views ourselves.<a name="0692qlink9">  Where to steer the discussion
from here, to help understand why our opinions differ so?</a>
