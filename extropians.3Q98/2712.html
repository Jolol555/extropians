<a name="2714qlink1"><a href="2707.html#2712qlink1">&gt;It is certainly true that smarter workers are now contributing more to</a><br>
<i>&gt;growth that larger populations.  But the question is what could create a</i><br>
<i>&gt;big *change* in that growth rate, and it's not clear we know how to help</i><br>
<i>&gt;people learn much faster.  But there is a potential for enabling much</i><br>
<i>&gt;faster labor population growth.</i><br>

In software production it is documented that the difference in allmost any
which way you can meassure it (productivity, quality etc.) has a factor of
10 between poor and good programmers, and between experienced and new
programmers.

<p>
As more and more parts of the "old" production will be like software
development many of the same mechanisms will step into effect.

<p>
Most of the people in the world has little or no education. If there is as
many as 500 millions with higher educations it is probably far to high a
figure. This means that there is perhaps 5 billions that can be far better
educated. Again an improvement factor of ten is possible.

<p>
So somewhere between 10-100 times better/more... prodution can be made
possible through education.

<p>
Naturally these figures are nowhere near precise but i am convinced that the
general idea is true and that there is room for massive improvement in
production through better education and training.

<p>
<a name="2714qlink2">A factor 10-100 in labour population growth will most likely have some side
effects (economical, ecological...) that are very hard to predict.</a>
