<a href="1365.html#1385qlink1">(((((My, you really are giving every sign of being *both* cowardly and </a><br>
nasty.
<br>
Every one of your posts consists of criticizing, insulting, and sniping.
<a name="1606qlink3">You don't have the courage to post under your real name.</a> And you make
false, slanderous comments as if that was an acceptable thing to do on 
our
<br>
list. Not only do you hide your identity, you don't come out and say 
that
<br>
you are referring to me here. FYI, those pictures are not in slightest 
bit
<br>
doctored. That's just wishful thinking on your part. (And I don't wear
leather; that's vinyl. At least try to get your facts straight.)))))

<p>
If I give my name then my statements become more or less true? Thats a 
new concept. I say 1+1=2 before you know who I am and that is less true 
than me saying it after I tell you my name. I get it.

<p>
My name is Colin and I'm work at a computer gaming company in Boston. I 
dabble in academics at BU on the side. Do you feel better now Max? 
Please reread my posts now that you know my name.

<p>
When I mentioned doctored images I was not referring to yours. But 
thanks for noticing.

<p>
If you can not digest my point then thats okay. I guess it is hard to 
wear several masks. But dont lash out with the offensive narcissistic 
babble you offered in your last post. The last time I saw that kind of 
crap was when you went lunar on Erik Moeller because you did not like 
what he said. You'd think a philosopher would be more rational.

<p>
Try dropping the elitist gig.

Boog (aka Colin)
