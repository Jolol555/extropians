<a href="0242.html#0252qlink2">&gt;&gt; Well, it all depends on what your propulsion system is. If you are</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; using a reaction fuel based system, and are relying on internal fuel</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; stores, he is right, you won't last very long.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Won't last very long?  As in you'll be crushed or something?</i><br>

<p>
No, as in you'll run out of reaction mass.

<a href="0242.html#0252qlink3">&gt;	Cool!  So if you can harvest or collect the fuel and mass to</a><br>
<i>&gt;use for acceleration as you go this makes a difference from if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;start with your fuel and mass on board?</i><br>

<p>
There is apparently little reason to 
<br>
think that this will work very well, and
some have gone so far as to suggest
<br>
that it would make an excellent brake.

<p>
<a href="0242.html#0252qlink4">&gt;&gt; &gt; If you were orbiting, at near the speed of light, just above the</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; event horizon, wouldn't you feel weightless?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; No, you would feel rather strained, to say the least....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	This can't be right can it?  </i><br>

<p>
&lt;snip of lots of questions, many of 
<br>
which I can't answer...&gt;
<br>
<a name="0293qlink1">Tidal forces would be a real problem.
<br>
The gravitational force that one side or
end of your body would feel would be
<br>
different enough from the other side or
</a>
<br>
end, that you would be pulled apart 
<br>
and/or squashed, in different directions.
