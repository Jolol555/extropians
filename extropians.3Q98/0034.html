It was delight to this Sasha quoted in this piece -- and just while he is
staying with me and Natasha. He's out walking around Venice Beach, so it'll be
a nice surprise when he returns.

<p>
You can find Sasha's Hypereconomy article in the Dow Jones magazine? What's
the
<br>
exact citation, Sasha?

Internet commerce could spur more and more economic swings

LONDON (July 1, 1998 1:04 p.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nandotimes.com">http://www.nandotimes.com</a>) - Economic booms
and busts could become more frequent as shopping on the Internet takes off,
according to a study published on Wednesday. 

<p>
Jeffrey Kephart and his colleagues at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
Center in
<br>
New York said that as consumers buy more goods and services online, they
increasingly turn to programs known as software agents to search for the best
prices. 

<p>
"These agents tend to exaggerate the worst market swings and create disastrous<br>
price wars," the New Scientist, reviewing the research, said. 

<p>
Kephart said software agents are not subject to the restraints that normally
rein in economic activity. 

<p>
"Their transactions take place almost instantaneously, cost next to nothing<br>
and
<br>
distance is irrelevant," he said. 

<p>
His research found that the rapid reaction of agents to price changes meant
<br>
"devastating price wars rage constantly, and providers' profits varied wildly<br>
as they fought for business." 
<br>
Alexander Chislenko, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ran similar
research models and got the same results, the New Scientist said. 

<p>
He said "agent economies" tend toward the chaotic and "would be like trying to
control a car that was traveling at 500 miles an hour."
