I'd bet that if a widely respected Extropian like Hal Finney or Carl Feynman
were to look at a random sampling of people labeled "kooks" by their 
contemporaries in the last 500 years, they'd conclude most of these "kooks"
really were, in Hal's or Carl's favored sense of the word.  Sure among those
millions were people advocating stuff we like, but what fraction of "kooks"
was that?  And how many of the "kooks" advocating stuff we like had good
arguments for their positions?
