<p>
I have lots of the uplifting discussion as I was its instigator last time
around.:)
<br>
<a name="1886qlink2">Some of the participants regarded some of the proposals as immoral,</a> which
demonstrates that ethical questions are asked here.  (Some might complain
that they are asked too often.:)  I think we should discuss more concrete
strategies and applications of more near term technologies here.)

<p>
<a href="1795.html#1796qlink2">&gt;But generally people are more interested in things that give *them* or</a><br>
<i>&gt;their close ones a benefit. You might regard all entities as close</i><br>
<i>&gt;ones, but others may have other priorities. This is still completely</i><br>
<i>&gt;rational in the sense of using efficient means to reach one's goals. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="1886qlink3">I see nothing wrong (and assume Andres agrees???) with helping</a> others
out.  My own strategy is to spread transhumanist/Extropian ideas as far
and wide as is practical so that more people will become our allies in the
battle to uplift ourselves.

Cheers!
