<p>
Yes, I created the pointing table moving example.  *You* responded by
postulating "only if there was a mark on the wall." Then you dismissed
my objection because "if it did have such a mark then the room would no
longer have cylindrical symmetry."  I.E., *you* invented the part of my
argument that you later refuted.  This was the straw-man point.

<p>
<a name="0860qlink2">But then they wouldn't be seeing the same thing.</a>  One would be on the
left, while the other would be on the right.  One would have to lead
with the table, while the other would have to follow.  They would know
which one was the leader and which one was the follower.  Their
<a name="0860qlink3">identities would diverge, by your definition.</a>  Again, the example does
not prevent the divergence of perception that you require.

<p>
Yes, we agreed to that before the symmetrical room example.  I believe
<a name="0860qlink4">that you asserted that the symmetrical room would prevent such
<a name="0860qlink5">divergence.</a>  I believe that I have shown that it does not.  Are we now
agreed on this latter point?</a>
