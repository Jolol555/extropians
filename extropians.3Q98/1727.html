hi everybody, I'm emmanuel charpentier, french guy from Paris and new
to the list.

<p>
 I find the duplicates thought interesting, and see how much it can
lead to possibilities of divergences between two personas (and not one
of them has the right to be called "original", isn't it?). The main
divergence might not even be that you don't want to die or suffer
amnesia, but might simply be that you have important knowledge you
can't lose! (and there is knwoledge you can't share with others)

<p>
  Did you think about partials? You only duplicate part of your neural
net. Like in Greg Bear's eon, you use agents which are really copies
of parts of yourself.

<p>
<a name="1784qlink1">   Another solution would simply be to have only one neural net (the
original :) but many thought processes. The configuration/topology of
the neural net is mainly the long term memory, the firing of neurons
and synapses is mainly the working memory, so you just need to
duplicate the later one... no? What you obtain is layers of persona.
You can have 1000 thought processes and just one neural net
configuration.</a>

<p>
<a name="1784qlink2">    Of course, it could still leads to serious troubles: how do you
share important new informations? How do you change the configuration
of the neural net (I guess sleep is a key)?</a> What do you do with your
body, because you still have only one?<a name="1784qlink3"> Can a neural net layer function
normally without a body?</a> Can there still be divergences between
layers? How do one layer integrate neural net changes made by another
layer (if there are any)?

<p>
    Bye. Manu.
