<i>&gt; Shulman seeks people for drug study</i><br>
<i>&gt; Parkinson's trust needs volunteers to determine whether Deprenyl can</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase life span</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Seventy-three-year-old Morton Shulman thinks he's found the Fountain of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Youth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Beginning Monday, the Parkinson's Charitable Trust will begin running ads</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Toronto newspapers looking for 1,500 volunteers to participate in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; long-term study to determine whether the drug Deprenyl can make you live</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer and better.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "Without Deprenyl, I would have been dead in 1989," said Dr. Shulman, who</i><br>
<i>&gt; was instrumental in setting up the trust after he contracted Parkinson's</i><br>
<i>&gt; disease 15 years ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Dr. Shulman's study is the latest attempt in a centuries-old search to</i><br>
<i>&gt; stave off the aging process, an obsession that dates back to the 16th</i><br>
<i>&gt; century when Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon, searching for the Fountain of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Youth, discovered Florida instead.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Today, pharmaceutical companies are developing more than 150 medicines for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the debilitating diseases of aging. Moreover, Canadian researchers recently</i><br>
<i>&gt; indentified a gene that plays a central role in aging. And biologists,</i><br>
<i>&gt; studying aging at the cellular and genetic levels, are finding that life</i><br>
<i>&gt; span is far easier to manipulate than they had expected.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "Dr. Shulman has always had a nagging interest that Deprenyl slows down</i><br>
<i>&gt; the breakdown of certain cells in the brain that cause the aging process,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; said Trevor Williams, the former head of the Parkinson Foundation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Canada. Mr. Williams left the foundation in March and will manage the new</i><br>
<i>&gt; Deprenyl studies as the senior staffer at the Parkinson's trust.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Half of the 1,500 volunteers in the "double-blind" Deprenyl study will</i><br>
<i>&gt; take five milligrams of the drug twice a week beginning in September, while</i><br>
<i>&gt; the other half will take a like amount of a placebo. Dr. Shulman, who says</i><br>
<i>&gt; Deprenyl is harmless and doesn't interact with any other drug, wants</i><br>
<i>&gt; healthy individuals aged 40 to 65 for the 15-year study. Initial results</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be reviewed in five years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  But the real drama will begin in the next 12 months when the Parkinson's</i><br>
<i>&gt; trust will begin testing a newly developed derivative of Deprenyl on 1,500</i><br>
<i>&gt; new volunteers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  In an interview, Dr. Shulman said Jozsef Knoll, the Hungarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; pharmacologist who originally invented Deprenyl, has been working with</i><br>
<i>&gt; animals for the  past three years to improve the drug. "By cutting off one</i><br>
<i>&gt; part of the molecular chemical structure, Dr. Knoll has produced a drug</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is 100 times more effective than Deprenyl."</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The new drug, which is hush-hush because Dr. Knoll hasn't applied for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; patent yet and hasn't published his findings, will also be tested against</i><br>
<i>&gt; Deprenyl and a placebo next year.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Dr. Shulman said that like Deprenyl, the new drug has no side effects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; "The effect it has on dogs and cats and smaller animals is amazing. Dogs</i><br>
<i>&gt; are living 50 per cent longer and smaller animals, like birds, live twice</i><br>
<i>&gt; as long."</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Dr. Shulman and Dr. Knoll have been friends and colleagues for several</i><br>
<i>&gt; decades. Dr. Shulman originally acquired Dr. Knoll's work in 1990 for his</i><br>
<i>&gt; company, Deprenyl Research Ltd., now Draxis Health Inc or Toronto.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Last December, when Draxis sold the rights to an animal version of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Deprenyl to Pfizer Inc., DR. Shulman forced Draxis to issue 200,000</i><br>
<i>&gt; warrents to Dr. Knoll to fulfill part of the original 1990 contract.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Largely at the urging and backing of Dr. Shulman, Dr. Knoll is now suing</i><br>
<i>&gt; Draxis for $100-million (U.S.) claiming breach of contract and infringement</i><br>
<i>&gt; of patent rights. Draxis has countered by suing Dr. Shulman for, among</i><br>
<i>&gt; other things, interfering with its $41-million deal with Pfizer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  According to Dr. Shulman, the only longevity study with Deprenyl on humans</i><br>
<i>&gt; was conducted in 1985 by Walter Birkmayer at the University of Vienna. His</i><br>
<i>&gt; patients - all suffering from Parkinson's - lived on average an additional</i><br>
<i>&gt; 15 to 28 months. "It wasn't an ideal study because it wasn't a</i><br>
<i>&gt; double-blind," Dr. Shulman said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  In a double-blind study, neither patients nor researchers know who is</i><br>
<i>&gt; getting the real drug and who is taking the placebo.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Earlier this week, Dr. Shulman offered New York-based Pfizer a chance to</i><br>
<i>&gt; participate in Dr. Knoll's new studies and possibly acquire 50 per cent "of</i><br>
<i>&gt; all our end holdings." Pfizer hasn't responded. But Dr. Shulman believes a</i><br>
<i>&gt; more potent form of Deprenyl will have "important competitive implications"</i><br>
<i>&gt; for Pfizer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "Dr. Knoll has never been wrong before," Dr. Shulman said. "Can you</i><br>
<i>&gt; imagine the significance if we can prove in humans what we know works in</i><br>
<i>&gt; animals."</i><br>
