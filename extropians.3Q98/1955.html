<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Randall</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;No, however...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ok, put yourself in the position of the man chained to the bomb.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you listen carefully you'll notice that over the ticking ofthe</i><br>
<i>&gt;bomb you can hear distant music coming from a party the other</i><br>
<i>&gt;Randall went to, he's having a wonderful time, you're having</i><br>
<i>&gt;less fun chained to that damn bomb. You know that the other</i><br>
<i>&gt;Randall is not you and you know you have exactly 38 minutes</i><br>
<i>&gt;and 17 second to live. Do you see anyreason why you might</i><br>
<i>&gt;be just a tad upset with the situation?</i><br>

<p>
John, lemme correct a possible misunderstanding.
<a name="2004qlink1">*I* do not disagree that the two are different people.
It did seem odd to me that *you* expressed the same
</a>
view, however, since<a name="2004qlink2"> you have previously stated that
you believe (correct me if I err) that two physical instances
of exactly the same pattern of mind are really only one
</a>
person.  This seems to me to imply that one of the
two physical copies we seem to see is merely illusion,
but I gather that this doesn't follow, to you.  I do not 
understand that, and perhaps this is partly to blame 
for my viewing your position as inconsistent where
it concerns two copies separated by only trivial 
amounts of time.

<p>
<a href="1952.html#1955qlink2">&gt;&gt;To say that Randall-minus-an-hour's opinion is</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;better than mine, you must first *assume*</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that we are not the same person.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm much more interested in the Randall-plus-an-hour's</i><br>
<i>&gt;opinion. If he thinks you survived, that is, if he can remember</i><br>
<i>&gt;being you then you're OK but if not, like the poor man in my</i><br>
<i>&gt;example, then when the bomb goes off he's dead.</i><br>

<p>
Again with the amnesia argument:  if you wake
up and are told that it is 1999, and that you have
been in a coma ever since that nearly-fatal 
accident last September, do you think that the
person that existed in September *died*, if
you cannot remember having been him?

<p>
<a href="1952.html#1955qlink3">&gt;&gt;This leads to the conclusion that when</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;people have amnesia, someone *died*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, or at least someone mostly died, survival is a matter of</i><br>
<i>&gt;degrees</i><br>

<p>
Hm.  Okay.

<p>
<a href="1952.html#1955qlink4">&gt;&gt;Just to clear things up, let me rephrase what</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you seem to be saying:  Two perfectly identical (at the neural</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;level, anyway) people are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;two people, but one.  However, if they diverge</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;as much as a normal person changes in one</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;hour, the loss of that hour constitutes death (e.g.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;if you kill one).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unless I was in a deep sleep I'd say an hour would be more than</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough time for both copies of me to want to survive</i><br>

<p>
I'd say that less than a second is sufficient, 
but then, I also think that both copies are 
separate people.

<a href="1952.html#1955qlink6">&gt;&gt;The point of view that matters here is not that of a Martians</a><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Exactly, and from my present ego's point of view a copy made</i><br>
