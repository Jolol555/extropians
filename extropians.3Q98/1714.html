<a href="1706.html#1714qlink1">&gt; &gt; Are you telling me that if you looked</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; down</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; right now and saw "#87" on your name tag you'd cheerfully put a gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to your head? If so I wouldn't go so far as to call your decision</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; irrational, life is not more rational than death, it's just that death</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; my cup of tea. To each their own.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You've just told me that 10 hour amnesia equals death.  Does</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1=1,000,000?  Would I look at my name tag and commit suicide -</i><br>
<i>&gt; Absolutely not!  Would I look at my name tag and commit 10 hour</i><br>
<i>&gt; amnesia - Yes, in a clock cycle.  This of course presumes that I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; a stronger desire not to diverge multiple copies than I do to not</i><br>
<i>&gt; commit 10 hour amnesia.</i><br>

<p>
This is obviously a personal issue. Different people will have different
results, you can't apply a blanket conclusion about the issue because it
is based upon mental aspects of a person before he/she is copied.

<p>
<a name="1729qlink1">If you believe that a copy of you couldn't commit suicide, then your copy
would also have that belief, and it will become true.

<p>
If, however, you believe your copy could commit suicide, then your copy
</a>
would also have the same belief, and it will become true. 

<p>
As far as I can tell, my conclusion of inconclusivenes is entirely
correct and based upon logic. 

<p>
Whether a clone could commit suicide is entirely based upon the personal
belief of the individual before he/she is clone.  Clones of some people
will voluntarily die off, clones of other people would not. I for one have
trouble just keeping the original of me from voluntarily dying off.

<p>
As they say, results may vary.
