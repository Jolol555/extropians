You're right that helicopters have a problem above 8km (the "Death Zone").
But...

<p>
It turns out that true Rotons don't occupy the same flight regime as
helicopters.

<p>
Helicopters have to fly sideways. Thus they have unbalanced lift on the
blades.
<br>
They have freely-moving very high aspect ratio rotor blades, which causes
all sorts of instabilities when the air speed across them gets too high
(Mach &gt;&gt; 1). The blades are driven by a central shaft that usually must be
articulated to permit maneuvering.

<p>
The permissible RPM on a helicopter rotor is strictly limited by all these
factors.
<br>
There are a few "rigid rotor" designs that address these limitations, but...

<p>
All these characteristics are different from boost-phase Rotons. If you can
spin up a stiff blade array to incredible (non-helicopter-achievable) RPMs,
you can still get some bite out of very thin air. The stresses on the
structure are enormous, but they're symmetrical--if all goes well. The
Roton work I looked at a few years ago also used a hoop to keep the blade
tips constrained.

<p>
<a name="1410qlink1">Calculations suggest that Rotons could work all the way out to where air
acts in a Newtonian way. That's a lot higher than the operating altitude of
a chopper. 

<p>
And of course you're only using the rotor for *part* of your lift. That's
another difference from regular helicopters.

<p>
Not promoting, just reporting.

<p>
And rockets, all by themselves, are still the prizewinners at inefficient.</a>
