Exactly, no country is perfect, far from it in fact. Neither the
European nor the US governments deserve our nationalism, so let's fight
*them* and not eachother.

<p>
Btw, the war on drugs can be pretty bad in Europe too, don't let things
like Dutch "gedoogbeleid" (sounds a bit like "apartheid" ;-) fool you.
For example, you wouldn't want to be caught smoking reefer in France...
On the other hand, gun control can be pretty bad in the US, the 10
rounds-only magazine law and the hype agianst "assault weapons" being
prime examples.
