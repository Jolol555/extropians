Yes. But this still doesn't prevent people for having utterly
contradictory beliefs and insisting that they make complete
sense. 

<p>
People suffering from anosognosia have paralysis on the left side of
the body, but doesn't know they are sick; when presented with evidence
that they are paralysed they instead think that there is somebody else
who is sick or that they were paralysed in the past but not now. OK,
anosognosia is a biological error (I don't believe fundamentalistm is,
despite the attraction of the idea ;-) but shows that it is possible
to be otherwise entirely rational and have utterly contradictory
thoughts.

<p>
A fundamentalist geologist can simply decide that all the talk about
geological age, fossils and plate tektonics is a convenient shorthand
for various geological phenomena that *really* are due to the deluge,
but since they form a consistent system and enable him to deal with
his colleauges he can "play along" when it comes to practical matters. 

<p>
It is all a questions of cognitive schemas and how we assimilate
information into them, and more rarely accomodate the schemas to fit
new information. Since the later is hard and requires effort, we tend
to assimilate information that fits, force stuff that doesn't fit into
the schemas anyway, or even ignore contradictory information. The
partitioning just means one avoid accomodation by having very broad
schemas where contradictions doesn't matter. Awful? At least to people
like me who want to think rationally, but it is really used by people.
