Ok, let me repeat this one more time and see how simple I can put it to 
see if you finally get it.

<p>
<a name="2017qlink2">If one of Truax's multi-stage monsters suffers an engine failure, whether
or not it's catastrophic, it has two choices. It aborts to orbit or it
crashes and burns.</a> That's all it can do, because there's no way you can
<a name="2017qlink3">land a multi-stage monster like</a> that. So if it can't abort to orbit it's
going down and there's no point bothering to design it to survive; the
range safety officer is going to blow it up anyway. This would, in most
cases, also apply to an expendable SSTO.

<p>
If a reusable SSTO like Roton loses an engine it can abort to orbit, land, 
or crash and burn. It can land because it's, like, designed to. It's not
a huge, tall, narrow monster rocket that's only designed to fall into 
<a name="2017qlink4">an ocean, it's actually supposed to land intact at the end of its flight.</a> 
Hence the designers can design it to survive such an in-flight failure and 
land safely with the crew and payload intact.

<p>
Is that clear enough?
