I think everyone would agree that they are identical, but are they one
system?  By counting, I mean you have two molecules of water.  They are
indistinguishable from each other.  Both are identical H2O.  Are there
two molecules of water, or one molecule of water somehow existing in two
locations?  How would you count indistinguishable systems.  The debate
lead to the point that some claimed there were multiple
indistinguishable systems, where some claimed that there was only one
such system, seemingly in multiple places concurrently.

<p>
Is this because of random motions, such as Browning(?) random vibration?
That is, each macro object may look the same, but all their atoms can't
hold in the exact same positon as its copy, because the atoms randomly
move around?

<p>

<a href="0842.html#0848qlink3">&gt; right? If _I_, the user, cannot distinguish between an object, and </a><br>

<i>&gt; obviously?</i><br>

<p>
Yes, for utility purposes of one of the objects.  But in counting total
objects, they must be distinquished by position to count them.  The
example I was quoting lead to the situation where a square room was
declared to have one wall, because it was "meaningless to make a
distinction between them."  There still are x number of objects, even if
they are all identical, right?  When two objects become identical or
indistinguishable, they don't suddenly merge into a single object, do
they?
