<a name="2229qlink1">&gt; From: Eliezer S. Yudkowsky &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt;<br>

<p>
<a href="2171.html#2177qlink1">&gt; Now I am still sure that the Powers will be ethical, but I am no </a><br>
<i>&gt; longer sure that this precludes taking us apart for spare atoms.  I no </i><br>
<i>&</a>gt; longer think that our continued survival has to threaten the Powers </i><br>
<i>&gt; for us to be erased; I am now willing to accept that simple efficiency </i><br>
<i>&gt; may require it.  I am willing to accept that life may be meaningless.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am willing to accept that the only reward for all my service will be </i><br>
<i>&gt; a painful death, for myself, for those I love, and for the entire </i><br>
<i>&gt; human race.  Only when one can accept all possibilities is one ready </i><br>
<i>&gt; to choose between them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The power of the Singularitarian philosophy is that it draws on </i><br>
<i>&gt; concepts with more force than our own desires.  Over time, over years, </i><br>
<i>&gt; it corrodes away our rationalizations.  And above all, it presents an </i><br>
<i>&gt; emotionally and rationally acceptable course of action, even after all </i><br>
<i>&gt; the darkest alternatives are accepted.  It really doesn't matter what </i><br>
<i>&gt; the relative probabilities are.  Either life has meaning, or it </i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't; either human life has meaning, or it doesn't; either we'll be </i><br>
<i>&gt; upgraded, or we'll die.  So we'll die?  All the other generations have </i><br>
<i>&gt; died.  It's not some major tragedy because it happens to me instead of </i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody else.  So humanity will die?  In a billion years, it is </i><br>
<i>&gt; certain that humanity will die.  Is it so horrible if humanity dies </i><br>
<i>&gt; giving birth to something greater, giving meaning to all our dead </i><br>
<i>&gt; ancestors?  Sooner or later, some generation will face the choice </i><br>
<i>&gt; between Singularity and extinction.  Why push it off, even if we </i><br>
<i>&gt; could?  And besides, we might not die at all.</i><br>

<p>
But we can't rely on that, can we?
 
<p>
<a href="2171.html#2177qlink2">&gt; Because my best-guess dedication to the Singularity is fairly </a><br>
<i>&gt; unaffected by the above probabilities varying between 0% and 90%, I </i><br>
<i>&gt; can calmly and without worry evaluate arguments for and against.  I </i><br>
<i>&gt; can accept that every possibility might be real.  The Singularity, </i><br>
<i>&gt; through it all, is the only sane way to go.  In accepting every </i><br>
<i>&gt; possibility, I can also accept the dictates of my own philosophy; I </i><br>
<i>&gt; don't need to distort it to avoid "unacceptable" outcomes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We must each lose our dreams in order to grow, but not in despair.  We </i><br>
<i>&gt; must abandon the small dreams of childhood, but without abandoning the </i><br>
<i>&gt; ability to dream.  For there are two ways in which a dream may be </i><br>
<i>&gt; broken; by the death of hope, or by a greater dream.  To acknowledge </i><br>
<i>&gt; that we do not command the future, is not to say that we do not make </i><br>
<i>&gt; it; and when we tear our eyes away from our yearnings, we may look </i><br>
<i>&gt; upward to the sun, forward to tomorrow. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="2229qlink2">This isn't completely true. We *can* command the future if we finish
the dash for SI in first place. If you lose yourself in defeatism you're
already as good as dead.</a> The facts are simple: 


<OL>
<a name="2229qlink3">  <li>  at this time, only a handful of people really grasp the enormity 
of the coming changes, and (almost certainly) most of them are 
transhumanists (unfortunately, even in this select group many
can't/won't understand the consequences of a Singularity, but
that aside).</a>

<a name="2229qlink4">  <li>  This gives us a *huge* edge, further increased by the high 
concentration of scientific/technological talent in the &gt;H community.
</a>
 
<a name="2229qlink5"><a name="2200qlink1">  <li>  If we start preparing now, by keeping a close eye on the
the development of technologies that could play a major part
in the Singularity (nanotech, AI, implants, intelligence
augmentation, human-machine interfaces in general etc.) 
and by aquiring wealth (by any effective means) to set up a 
SI research facility, then we have a real chance of success.</a></a> 


</OL>
<p>
<a name="2229qlink6">Note: the goal should (obviously) be creating SI by "uplifting" 
(gradually uploading and augmenting) humans, *not* from AIs.</a>

<p>
<a href="2171.html#2177qlink3">&gt; Forward to the day when humanity awakens from its dream, to the </a><br>
<i>&gt; ultimate shattering of Maya.  To the day when the greatest hacker of </i><br>
<i>&gt; them all compiles the very last line of code, and looks out at an </i><br>
<i>&gt; early morning sky, knowing that he looks on the Final Dawn.  To the </i><br>
<a name="2229qlink7"><i>&gt; day when it is said, in the tradition of Oppenheimer who looked upon </i><br>
<i>&gt; another sun:  "I am become Singularity, Breaker of Dreams." </i><br>

<p>
"Now I've become death, the destroyer of worlds."- The First SI?
