We have agreed about what the list of questions should be 
(modifications can still be made). The questions are divided into
sections. I have been posting one section at a time and eliciting
people's answer-suggestions. On some questions I have also provided my
own answer-suggestions for people to comment on or improve. When the
two remaining sections have been treated in this way, then it's time
to write up. I've saved people's comments in a file so they can be 
used at this stage.

<p>
We haven't decided yet what the best way to write it up will be. One
person does it all? A few person do it all together? A few persons
each do a few answers? - Maybe the best way would be if perhaps four 
experienced transhumanists do it together in whatever way they think 
suitable?

<p>
When the first draft is completed, then it should be posted back 
to the list so people can make suggestions for what could be changed 
and improved.

<p>
Doug Baily has made the excellent suggestion that we complement the 
FAQ with a Transhumanist Profiles page on the WTA site (that anybody 
who want could copy), where prominent transhumanists explain their 
own perspective and views in a few paragraphs in a personal way. This 
would show the divesity of views in transhumanism and would allow 
people to say what they really think rather than just the inevitably 
somewhat watered-down quasi-consensus of the FAQ. But it is better 
not to start this until we have finished the FAQ.
