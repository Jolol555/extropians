I think voluntary suicide would be more merciful and effective. There's

operation can take a LOT longer than a day or so. There might be some

using clean whole blood and the like - probably a better choice than a
chimp body...</a> Also, if death is planned, I can see little advantage to the
procedure. The whole point IMHO is to preserve the information in the
brain, and I can't see how the chimp procedure is going to do much if
anything.
