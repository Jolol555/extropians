I have to say I'm somewhat surprised and puzzled by this kind of reaction
to what seems like a perfectly valid and justifiable statement;</a> my 
experience has been very similar, in that most of the women I meet tend 
to be less attracted to radical ideas than most of the men.

<p>
I've just been going through my mailbox deleting a lot of old mail, which
included things like discussions of men generally being more violent than 
women and the links to testosterone levels, to which no male list member 
came back with any kind of sarcastic comments, and most agreed; it's</a> a 
simple fact to be discussed as such. Why is this topic any different?
Surely if many women do have an aversion to radical ideas then it's
something we should be discussing, not ignoring?
