<p>
Changing size and shape isn't that hard; but designing an organ is.  There's
quite a bit more to a brain than the fact that it's three pounds of fat in
a lumpy shape<a name="2566qlink4"> :-)  We could get a lot of mileage by adapting existing 
organisms/organs, as opposed to designing new</a> ones, and we are already doing
that with bacteria.  You could, potentially, adapt a rabbit to eat some 
poisonous plant weed by splicing in an appropriate detoxification enzyme.
But giving the rabbit a new organ - well, that's quite a ways off.
