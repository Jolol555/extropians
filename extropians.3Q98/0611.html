There is no "slack".  We are talking about overcrowded rats.  I know of
no mechanism for an gay rats to trigger increased breeding in other
rats.  It would be very interesting to discover a nonbreeding influence
on the subsequent generation!

<p>
Your assuming that all rats passing along the gay gene are themselves
gay.  Most genes are not simple dominant genes that express themselves
in their hosts.  This is why children can have traits not visible in
their parents, even though they were passed genetically from the
parents.

<p>
If there is a "gay gene", I'm not sure why you think it would be more
likely to be regulated by disease that any other gene.  I don't think
there are any gay-specific diseases.  HIV is too recent to be proposed
as a disease factor in evolution, and its incubation time is much too
long to prevent breeding.  Since gays don't reproduce as much as
nongays, I would expect a gay-preferring disease to have little effect
on genetics.
