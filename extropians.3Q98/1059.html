Title
<br>
  Tobacco control in a traditional Fijian village: indigenous methods of
  smoking cessation and relapse prevention.

Abstract
<br>
  This case study outlines the unique process by which a village in Fiji (N =
  238) developed and implemented an extremely successful community-based
  smoking cessation program. Both Western smoking cessation methods and native
  traditional rituals were used. Specific strategies included a group pledge,
  village rapid inhalation ceremony, social contracting through notices and
  media, and a tabu formalized through a kava ceremony.
  Whereas the more conventional, external, health professional oriented
  approaches were largely unsuccessful, longer term collaborative and village
  empowerment methods proved most successful. Eventually all persons in the
  village who smoked were able to give up smoking, with specific exceptions
  (elders, visitors, etc.) and became nationally known as the village that gave
  up smoking. Follow up evaluation at 9 and 21 months indicated sustained
  success. Cases of relapse are described involving supernatural consequences
  remedied by group and ceremonial methods. The socio-cultural context and
  larger relationship issues are discussed in order to more fully understand
  the effectiveness of the program.
