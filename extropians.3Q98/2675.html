ya, huuuuge advantages.  there is an unimaginable treasure
chest of medical wisdom waiting just below the surface,
waiting for us to find it.  i mean some really true breakthroughs.
i think we will find these thru web based health surveys and
data mining.  all we need, yes, ALL WE NEED friends, is
<a name="2679qlink1">some way to allow a large population to download a lot of
information about their lifestyle, health habits, health problems,
etc, into a universally accessible database, while simultaneously
protecting the database from vandalism (possibly by health
product manufacturers) and guarding the privacy of those who
contribute to the database.

<p>
how, extropians?  how how how how do we do it?  spike
