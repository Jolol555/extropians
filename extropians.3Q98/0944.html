<p>
We are all "at war with reality" in this sense, even if we commit no crime.
 The person who walks through the jungle "trys not to get caught" by the
lions, tigers and bears.  When the plague comes through town, everyone
"trys not to catch" it.  When I eat at the local dive, I try to avoid
food-poisoning, and on the way home I try to avoid getting hit by a truck.
Sooner or later, "reality" catches up with everyone, whether they commit
crimes or not; it is only a losing proposition for those who haven't
successfully reproduced (or made backups).

<p>
One only needs to "make the facts appear to be other than what they are"
when the crime that is being attempted is framing someone else for a crime.
 More usually, the criminal merely needs to make the facts unobtainable.
As for the rest of your assertion, one might ask: did Jesus really walk on
the water?  If not, then this misrepresentation of fact has been maintained
consistantly over the long term....

<p>

<p>
That you eventually became psychotic after commiting crimes doesn't mean
that the crimes caused the psychosis, and even if this link could be
established, it doesn't tell us that all criminals must suffer your fate.
