The closest I've seen to a coherent argument for explosive economic
growth is offered by Eliezer Yudkowsky, in 
<a href="http://www.tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html">http://www.tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html</a>

<a name="2486qlink1"><i>&gt;Every couple of years, computer performance doubles. ...  That is the </i><br>

<a name="2486qlink2"><i>&gt;progress according to mortals.  Right now the amount of computing power </i><br>
<i>&gt;on the planet is ... operations per second times the number of humans. </i><br>
<i>&gt;The amount of artificial computing power is so small as to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;irrelevant, ... At the old rate of progress, computers reach</a> human-</i><br>
<i>&gt;equivalence levels ... at around 2035.  Once we have human-equivalent </i><br>
<i>&gt;computers, the amount of computing power on the planet is equal to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;number of humans plus the number of computers.  The amount of </i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence available takes a huge jump. Ten years later, humans </i><br>
<i>&gt;become a vanishing quantity in the equation. ... That is actually a </i><br>
<i>&gt;very pessimistic projection,  Computer speeds don't double due to some </i><br>
<i>&gt;inexorable physical law, but because researchers and technicians find </i><br>
<i>&gt;ways to make them faster.  If some of the scientists and technicians </i><br>
<i>&gt;are computers - well, a group of human-equivalent computers spends 2 </i><br>
<i>&gt;years to double computer speeds. Then they spend another 2 subjective </i><br>
<i>&gt;years, or 1 year in human terms, to double it again. ... six months, </i><br>
<i>&gt;to double it again. Six months later, the computing power goes to </i><br>
<i>&gt;infinity.  ... This function is known mathematically as a singularity. </i><br>
<i>&gt;... a fairly pessimistic projection, ... because it assumes that only </i><br>
<i>&gt;speed is enhanced.  What if the quality of thought was enhanced? ...</i><br>

<p>
Eliezer's model seems to be that the doubling time of computer hardware 
efficiency is proportional to the computer operations per second devoted 
to R&amp;D in computer hardware, or within all of computer-aided "humanity."  
(I'm not clear which Eliezer intends.)

<p>
The "all of humanity" model has the problem that computer hardware wasn't
improving at all for a long time while humanity increased greatly in 
<a name="2485qlink1">size.  And while humanity has tripled since 1930, computer hardware 
doubling times have tracked this increase.  It is also not clear why 
</a>
animal and other biological computation is excluded from this model. 

<p>
The "within computer hardware R&amp;D" model has the problem that over the 
last half century doubling times have not increased in proportion to the 
number of people doing computer hardware R&amp;D.  (Anyone have figures on
this?)  Furthermore, is it plausible that the near zero doubling times of
~1700 could have been much improved by putting lots of people into 
computer R&amp;D then?  And if we next year doubled the number of people doing 
computer R&amp;D, I don't think we'd expect a doubling of the hardware 
doubling time. 

<p>
It is not at all clear what Eliezer thinks "quality" improvements scale as,
so there isn't much on this issue to discuss.
