Title
<br>
  The use of a whey
<br>
  protein concentrate in the
<br>
  treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma: a phase I-II clinical study.

Abstract
<br>
  Glutathione (GSH) concentration is high in most tumour cells and this may be
  an important factor in resistance to chemotherapy. Previous
  in-vitro and animal experiments have shown a differential response of tumour
  versus normal cells to various cysteine delivery systems. More specifically,
  an in-vitro assay showed that at concentrations that induce GSH
  synthesis in normal human cells, a specially prepared
  whey protein concentrate,
<br>
  Immunocal, caused GSH depletion and inhibition of
  proliferation in human breast cancer cells. On the basis of
  this information five patients with metastatic carcinoma of
  the breast, one of the pancreas and one of
  the liver were fed 30 grams of this whey
  protein concentrate daily for six months.
  In six patients the blood lymphocyte GSH levels were
  substantially above normal at the outset, reflecting high
  tumour GSH levels. Two patients (:1, :3) exhibited signs of tumour
  regression, normalization of haemoglobin and peripheral lymphocyte counts and
  a sustained drop of lymphocyte GSH levels towards normal. Two patients (:2,
  :7) showed stabilisation of the tumour, increased
  haemoglobin levels. In three patients (:4, :5, :6,) the
  disease progressed with a trend toward higher lymphocyte GSH levels.
  These results indicate that whey
<br>
  protein concentrate might deplete tumour
  cells of GSH and render them more vulnerable to
  chemotherapy.
