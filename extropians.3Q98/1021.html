Background:

<p>
"A senior general Thursday threw his weight behind a bold drive to
orce China's army out of business, telling his officers they have no
choice but to go along.

<p>
               The order for the military to shut down its vast
commercial empire was issued earlier this week by President Jiang
Zemin as part of a widening government campaign against smuggling.

<p>
               The order to close down military commerce was a bold
stroke for Jiang, given his lack of a military background, the
political clout of the army and the breadth of its business interests
<br>
-- ranging from karaoke halls to cellular phone networks -- that have<br>
earned it the nickname PLA Inc." [CNN]

<p>
<a name="1050qlink1">Forgetting the harm done by statists in China, for the moment. It's
interesting to note that China's army is openly making money. Rather
than forcing them to sell the enterprises they should take the ARMY
public with an IPO.</a>
