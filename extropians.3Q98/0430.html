<a name="0432qlink1">Good point.  Note, however, that the converse is also true; i.e., if gun
ownership really isn't tied to crime rate (either positively or
negatively), then owning a gun "for protection", as many gun owners on this
list claim to do, may not make sense.</a>  If I were living in a neighborhood
<a name="0432qlink2">where crime was rampant, and for whatever reason couldn't/wouldn't leave,
then owning a gun might very well be reasonable. If I didn't (and I don't),
then my resources are likely better spent elsewhere.</a>

<p>
<a href="0383.html#0430qlink2">&gt;Presumably this is -- as, I think, Dawkins pointed out -- because we've</a><br>

<p>
In the same section (I forget which book, though), Dawkins makes the
example that if we had natural lifespans of say, 500 000 years, we would
probably avoid "high-risk" activities such as crossing the street.  I find
<a name="0432qlink3">this a sobering thought: it would be a sad irony indeed if in gaining
indefinite lifespans we become afraid to live.</a>
