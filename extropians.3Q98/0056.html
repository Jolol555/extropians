<a href="0055.html#0056qlink1">&gt; Asimov invented the Three Laws as a device by which conflicts could be</a><br>

<i>&gt; impossibly complex results.</i><br>

<p>
I think this was the greatest success of his robot stories: he managed
to show how three apparently simple and logical rules could produce
very complex and unexpected results. In many ways Asimov was before
his time in this respect.

<p>
<a href="0055.html#0056qlink2">&gt; So, what if a robot has this choice:</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Kill someone, and allow 100 others to live, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	not kill, and allow the 100 others to die.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This would probably immobilize the robot, which is the worst choice,</i><br>
<i>&gt; so the Zero'th Law is:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 0. A robot, when faced with a choice which results in harm,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    chooses the one resulting in the least harm.</i><br>

<p>
OK, I see the reasoning now. Of course, it took some pretty smart
robots to come up with this, as far as I can remember it was just
Griscard (?) and Daneel who suceeded.

<p>
<a href="0055.html#0056qlink3">&gt; Implied is that this Law overrides the other three; that the phrase</a><br>
<a name="0171qlink1"><i>&gt; "except when in conflict with the Zero'th Law" is added to the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3 Laws.</i><br>

<p>
This suggests a loophole in the original laws, that you can add higher
level laws derived from the others, which was probably not intended by
the human designers. Another unexpected feature; I can really
understand why Susan Calvin decided to become a robot psychologist.
