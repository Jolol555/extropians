<p>
<a href="1286.html#1302qlink2">&gt;&gt; Somehow the wealth appears to be spreading.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, but this is fundamentally different; godhood isn't something</i><br>
<i>&gt;that one would sell (or give away) like one would do with minor</i><br>
<i>&gt;technological advances such as phones, TVs cars etc. Just like nukes</i><br>
<i>&gt;were (and are) only for a select few, </i><br>

<p>
The fact is that nukes are easily buildable by
private individuals and groups; the fact that 
none have been detonated by private groups
is evidence that only sociopaths want them.

<p>
<i>&gt;so will hyperintelligence, </i><br>
<a href="1286.html#1302qlink3">&gt;nanotech, uploading etc. initially be only available to a select</a><br>
<i>&gt;group, which will most likely use them to become gods. There is</i><br>
<i>&gt;no rational reason to distribute this kind of power once you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;it. </i><br>

<p>
The "power" you speak of is *trivial* compared to
all the things that nanotech will be able to do; why
would someone who could do nearly anything they
would like want to play god to a few morons?
On another note, if you could lift your pet's intelligence
to that of your own, would you?  I think a lot of people
would, and how much more, then, other humans?

<p>
<a href="1286.html#1302qlink4">&gt;Powerful businessmen still need others to make and buy their products,</a><br>
<i>&gt;and dictators and presidents still need their people to stay in power</i><br>
<i>&gt;&amp; to keep the country running, but a SI needs NO-ONE, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;supremely autonomous. </i><br>

<p>
This is my point.

<p>
<i>&gt;I can't imagine why it would share its </i><br>
<a href="1286.html#1302qlink5">&gt;awesome power with creatures that are horribly primitive from its point </a><br>
<i>&gt;of view. Would *we* uplift ants/mice/dogs/monkeys to rule the world</i><br>
<i>&gt;as our equals? I think not.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, of course! Why *not*?  It would certainly 
be interesting, and we lose nothing in the deal,
except our boredom. :)

<p>
<a href="1286.html#1302qlink6">&gt;But then again, we can only guess at a SIs motivations (but I</a><br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't count too much on its benevolence). In any case, we</i><br>
<i>&gt;should all work hard to be among the first SIs, that's the only</i><br>
<i>&gt;reasonably sure way to live long and prosper.</i><br>

<p>
I agree here, but for different reasons.  I don't think
that there is any point in worrying about some small
group or individual getting nanotech and preventing
everyone else from it, because I don't know that there
is anything that can be done about that.  The other 
possibility is that it will be available to everyone, more
or less without cost, and that opens the door to other
problems fairly quickly, such as runaway replication.
Therefore I think that one of the things we ought to be
doing now is designing an easily built (by assemblers)
launch vehicle/escape boat, to molecular specifications,
for wide distribution via the internet.
