<i>&gt;&gt;From what I understand, prenatal stress during certain fetal critical </i><br>
<i>&gt;periods can cause the mother's hormonal levels and ratios to </i><br>
<i>&gt;fluctuate, resulting in an increased likelihood of homosexual </i><br>
<i>&gt;orientation in the child.  This makes evolutionary sense; if the </i><br>
<i>&gt;environment is hostile enough to cause hardship-induced stress to </i><br>
<i>&gt;the mother, it is likely (the rule - though periodically broken - being </i><br>
<i>&gt;environmental inertia) to be rough on succeeding generations.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Individuals who would not have children of their own and could </i><br>

<i>&gt;children would help sustain a genetic line through these times; when </i><br>
<i>&gt;the environment improved and stress dscreased, so would the </i><br>
<i>&gt;homosexual percentage of the population.  I believe a study was </i><br>

<i>&gt;W II period.</i><br>

<p>
The more common effect of stress on human females during pregnancy is
miscarriage.  I find it hard to believe the scenario you suggest could have
evolved: if resources are plentiful enough that a woman can afford to raise
a dud kid, why not raise a loaded one instead?  Same cost.  If things are
so tight she can't afford to raise a kid, raising a kid to help out isn't a
viable alternative.  Seems bogus to me.  Hard to apply to the gay rats, as
well.

<p>
Pray dust off this half-century old study and reveal the identity of the
authors, so I can laugh at them....
