Thanks, Doug, for the info on independent uses of "extropy."  Just for the
record, I have never claimed to be the only person to think up the term.  It
does not take, in all truth, much creativity to string together a couple of
common roots.  I only claim to have coined the term in January, 1988 to label
a philosophy of life (in contrast to merely a physical phenomena).  Max More,
of course, deserves almost sole credit for having given "extropy," as we use
it here, its current meaning.
