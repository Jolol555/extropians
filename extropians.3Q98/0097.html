<i>&gt;&gt;  This is NOT radical right-wing paranoia. Most of the elements of the new</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  proposed national ID system are already in place NOW. The next step is</i><br>
for
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  all information to be coordinated and completely accessible to any and</i><br>
all
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  bureaucrats for their arbitrary and capricious abuse.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  The national ID card itself (which you will be required to carry) will</i><br>
have
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  a magnetic strip (or chip) which is imbedded in it. That means YOU (when</i><br>
you
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  have your mandated national ID card on your person) could be tracked</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  wherever you go. Privacy will be an anachronism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Other cards that have magnetic strips: credit cards, ATM cards, hotel</i><br>
keys,
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; appt keys, et al.  The magnetic strips can't be used to somehow follow</i><br>
your
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; movements.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Oh yes they can. Credit card and debit card purchases directly access</i><br>
nationwide
<br>
<i>&gt;financial databases. Authorities have the ability to put 'sniffers' on</i><br>
these
<br>
<i>&gt;systems to track people by their purchase locations. This applies to</i><br>
hotels,
<br>
<i>&gt;restaurants, etc. In fact,  my bank was able to track me down while I was</i><br>
on
<br>
<i>&gt;vacation last month to notify me of an account problem. Its kind of odd to</i><br>
get a
<br>
<i>&gt;phone call from your personal banker while having after dinner</i><br>
coffee......500
<br>
<i>&gt;miles away from home.... I shiver at the thought that some government</i><br>
fascist
<br>
<i>&gt;might track me down and drag me away merely by my participation in the</i><br>
economy.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; But the author of the article seems more interested in propogating</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a juvenile kind of paranoia than paying much attention to the benefits of</i><br>
such
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a system or to the fact that the system really doesn't add any new powers</i><br>
to
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the government but only makes the government more efficient.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Total BS. It makes to government more efficient at tracking people down, as</i><br>
well
<br>
<i>&gt;as knowing everything about the people they are tracking down. The minute a</i><br>
<i>&gt;fascist/totalitarian party takes over, the mechanisms will be in place for</i><br>
them to
<br>
<i>&gt;commit intercontinental genocide in a matter of hours.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; In any immensely</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; large and complex society such as ours a standardized identification</i><br>
system
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; makes perfect sense.  And the presence of it simply has nothing to do</i><br>
with
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; government encroachment of anyone's rights.  It DOES have to do with</i><br>
making
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the government more efficient.  The place to protect rights, however, is</i><br>
in
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the courts and the legislatures, and NOT upon the assumption of</i><br>
governmental
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; inefficiency in enforcing its laws.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Again, BS. As said by many great plitical philosophers and leaders in</i><br>
history:
<br>
<i>&gt;"That government governs best which governs least." Hindering the</i><br>
government's
<br>
<i>&gt;ability to be tempted by such powers are necessary. Giving such absolute</i><br>
power
<br>
<i>&gt;over the individual's privacy to a priviledged few in the bureaucracy is</i><br>
the most
<br>
<i>&gt;corrupting potential in government. Privacy should be controlled by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual, not by the government. Assuming that government will 'do the</i><br>
right
<br>
<i>&gt;thing' with your personal information is assuming once too much.</i><br>

    Michael,
<br>
    Thanks for pointing some of the more obvious problems with this
reasoning.
<br>
By this way of thinking, the govt should have bugs in everyones homes to
protect
<br>
us from every concievable harm. After, if you're not breaking the law, what
have you got to worry about? Making the govt even *more* efficient at
tracking every
<br>
move makes me shudder. Haven't we all read 1984?
