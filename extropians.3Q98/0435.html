Abstract
<br>
  Abnormal glucose metabolism in uremia may result from a complex interplay
  between decreased insulin secretion and insulin resistance. Recent studies
  report beneficial effect of biotin administration in glucose
  metabolism in diabetic animals and in a small number of patients with
  diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study was to
  evaluate the response of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to the i.v.
  administration of large doses of biotin in hemodialysis
  patients. Eleven hemodialysis patients aged 56.90 +/- 11.20 (32-76) years on
  regular hemodialysis thrice a week for 2.72 +/- 1.79 (1-7) years were
  studied. Fasting venous plasma glucose, glucosylated hemoglobin (%GH), and
  plasma glucose concentration 2 h after the administration of a 75-g glucose
  load were measured before, and 2 weeks and 2 months after administration of
  50 mg of biotin i.v. postdialysis, and after a 2-month
  washout period. During the study, dialysis schedule and patients' medication,
  diet, and dry weight were kept unchanged. OGTT was abnormal in 4 patients
  before biotin administration and became normal in 3 patients
  (75%). Our results offer support to the findings of other studies about the
  beneficial effect of biotin in experimental or clinical
  diabetes mellitus, and argue for the involvement of
  biotin in glucose metabolism.
