I'll give you the same answer I gave Bryan Moss:

<p>
Wrong.  Suppose my copy and I want to move the table to one side.  If we
both point to the same wall, one would be pointing left while one would
be pointing right.  Obviously we are not acting the same.  If we both
point right or we both point left, we will be pointing at different
walls. Obviously we cannot agree on which wall to point towards.  Since
we are different people in different locations, it is impossible for us
to both act and react identically.  As in this situation, we must
diverge.
