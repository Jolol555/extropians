<a href="2587.html#2591qlink1">&gt; In the realm of marine biology it has long been observed that both</a><br>
<i>&gt; starfish and lobsters have very unique traits which, to the best of</i><br>
<i>&gt; current biological knowledge, do not occur elsewhere in nature.  For</i><br>
<i>&gt; one, starfish have regenerative capabilities: if one were to cut off</i><br>
<i>&gt; the limbs of a starfish (as many unknowing fishermen have often done)</i><br>
<i>&gt; it does not actually kill the starfish...in fact it creates five more</i><br>
<i>&gt; in its place.  Biologists know that this is an advanced form of budding,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but they do not know how or why.</i><br>

Bova discussed this in his new book on immortality. If I recall correctly
(I don't have the book in front of me), he did not mention any instances
where the ecology of these entities were investigated for possible
applicability to humans.
