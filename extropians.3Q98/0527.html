<a name="0531qlink1">I think you've got this backwards.  If everyone were armed, your "APD"
types would promptly get removed from the gene pool when they went nuts,
eliminating the problem at its source.</a>

<a name="0531qlink2">In your Brave New World scenario, where these people are sought out and
kept sociable via happy drugs or what-have-you, they would continue to be
fruitful and multiply.</a>

<p>
<a name="0531qlink3">Still, as individuals, we don't have a choice between these options--we can
neither arm everyone nor initiate the Brave New World.  We can only choose
whether to empower ourselves via arms, or not.</a>
