<a name="1185qlink1">Whether or not female members outnumber males is immaterial &amp; not the
source of my hasty response.  In fact I have no doubt that there are more
women involved in animal rights, as that jives with my own experiences.
What I began to object to is the causation you're assigning:
"The point is that the 'Cute' factor is what sells animal rightism and
vegetarianism (which is why many more women than men are one or the
other)," that is, women are spinelessly vulnerable to cuteness, turning off
any critical thinking capacity at the sight of a fuzzy nose in a cage &amp;
that there's no other explanation for their activism.

<p>
<a name="1185qlink2">Do you deny this implication, or do you have another explanation?  I have
little more to say on this; I'm only surprised the rest of the list let you
get this one</a> by.

<p>
<a href="1165.html#1167qlink7">:You have not made any opposing statements with any facts to support your</a><br>
claim,
<br>
<a href="1165.html#1167qlink8">:so if you cannot, then please rescind the personal attack and apologize.</a><br>

<p>
I already apologized for the accident of sending this message fragment to
the list; if you'll notice, it doesn't even end with a punctuation mark.
