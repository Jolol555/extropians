I am replying to report their actions.  I am also a member of this
"opt-in" list replying to a post sent to the "opt-in" list which you
"opted in" to receive.  The spammer is not a member of the list and
most of us did not "opt-in" to this list to receive spam.  Does this
help clarify the difference?  The reason I posted my reply to the list
was to show an alternative to just griping about the spam on the list.
 In other words if you don't like the spam on the list, do something
about it and encourage others to do the same and show them how it can
be done.

<a href="2497.html#2516qlink1">&gt; Attached is an example of spam which I have been receiving from your</a><br>
<i>&gt; network.  When I inquired in the anti-spam community the general</i><br>
<i>&gt; response was that direct1.net was a spam-happy spamhaus which allows</i><br>
<i>&gt; its customers to steal computer services from innocent netizens. </i><br>
Not

<p>
While I disagree that spam is theft, *if* it is theft, 
then how are you any different?
