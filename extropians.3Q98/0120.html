Yes, a better response to your original statement is that ethics</a> are
generally defined to be the rules of conduct (or the moral percepts) of a
particular culture or group, and as such are understandably subjective.
<a name="0245qlink2">Individuals *can*, of course, have a code of ethics separate from</a> the group,
<a name="0245qlink3">but when there is disagreement between two individuals' ethics, the most
reasonable course is to make a judgement based on consensual ethical
standards.  In other words, whether harm was done must ultimately</a> be left up
<a name="0245qlink4">to a jury of your peers.</a>  A sociopath can't be allowed to harm whoever s/he
<a name="0245qlink5">wishes simply because s/he has a *different* set of ethical standards.</a>
<a name="0245qlink6">Likewise, a chronic *victim* cannot be allowed to gain by unfairly accusing
others of harming them.  Both individuals may be acting ethically</a> from their
<a name="0245qlink7">frame of reference, but to use a phrase I've hear often lately... So what?</a>
<a name="0245qlink8">Ethical standards have little meaning if they are confined</a> to the individual
level.  Anyway I still disagree with your original assertion at the top of
this post:
