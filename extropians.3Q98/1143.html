Abstract
<br>
  Chromium is an essential nutrient involved in normal carbohydrate and lipid
  metabolism. The chromium requirement is postulated to increase with increased
  glucose intolerance and diabetes. The objective of this study was to test the
  hypothesis that the elevated intake of
  supplemental chromium is involved in the control of type 2
  diabetes. Individuals being treated for type 2 diabetes (180 men and women)
  were divided randomly into three groups and supplemented with: 1) placebo, 2)
  1.92 micromol (100 microg) Cr as chromium picolinate two times per day, or 3)
  9.6 micromol (500 microg) Cr two times per day. Subjects continued to take
  their normal medications and were instructed not to change their normal
  eating and living habits. HbA1c values improved significantly after 2 months
  in the group receiving 19.2 pmol (1,000 microg) Cr per day and was lower in
  both chromium groups after 4 months (placebo, 8.5 +/- 0.2%; 3.85 micromol Cr,
  7.5 +/- 0.2%; 19.2 micromol Cr, 6.6 +/- 0.1%). Fasting glucose was lower in
  the 19.2-micromol group after 2 and 4 months (4-month values: placebo, 8.8
  +/- 0.3 mmol/l; 19.2 micromol Cr, 7.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/l). Two-hour glucose
  values were also significantly lower for the subjects consuming 19.2 micromol
  supplemental Cr after both 2 and 4 months (4-month values:
  placebo, 12.3 +/- 0.4 mmo/l; 19.2 micromol Cr, 10.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/l). Fasting
  and 2-h insulin values decreased significantly in both groups receiving
  supplemental chromium after 2 and 4 months. Plasma total
  cholesterol also decreased after 4 months in the subjects receiving 19.2
  micromol/day Cr. These data demonstrate that supplemental
  chromium had significant beneficial effects on HbA1c, glucose, insulin, and
  cholesterol variables in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The beneficial
  effects of chromium in individuals with diabetes were observed at levels
  higher than the upper limit of the Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary
  Intake.
