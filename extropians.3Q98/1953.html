<p>
Dieks calculation rests on the self-indication axiom: that finding 
that you are an observer indicates that there are many 
observers. Only yourself can answer whether that is what you 
believed before you heard about the DA. Speaking for myself, I 
didn't believe that, and most other people don't seem to have 
<a name="1957qlink2">believed that either, since it was not generally accepted that by 
just sitting back in your armchair you could decide that the universe 
is infinite with probability one, unless it is impossible that it is 
infinite. Most people did, and presumably still do, believe that 
there is some finite probability that the universe is infinite and a 
finite probability that it is finite. If that is what you believe, 
then your prior was certainly not the one Dieks presupposes.</a>



<p>
<a name="1957qlink3"><a href="1884.html#1953qlink2">&gt; Let me repeat as forcefully as I can: There are standard approaches</a><br>
<i>&gt; to formally modeling our propects for doom, and which don't imply doom </i><br>
<i>&gt; soon.  To disagree with them, you must dispute some aspect of those </i><br>
<i>&gt; models, either their state spaces, priors, or information partitions.</i><br>

<p>
I don't know what "standard approaches" you are referring to. If 
you mean the one you outlined, I have already said that I think your 
specification of the state space is incoherent, since it presupposes 
that in a world with just one apple and one pear, there is a fact of 
the matter as to weather you are the apple and I'm the pear, or vice 
versa. I simply can't make any sense</a> of that.


<p>
I should also stress that I *do not* see the conclusion of the 
doomsday argument to be that doom is likely to strike soon, or 
maybe even ever. The name is misleading. I *do* see it as placing 
interesting constraints on what are plausible future scenarios and 
theories of the world at large. The implications are complex, and 
there seem to be many possibilities that are ruled out but also many 
very different possibilities that are still permitted. At some point 
I will post a summary of what I think some of the lessons are.
