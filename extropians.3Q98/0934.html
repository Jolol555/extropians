<a name="0977qlink6">It is possible that the qualia of consciousness is dependent on its

degree of accuracy, but it will never produce a shock wave.  Is
<a name="0977qlink3">consciousness more of a shock wave than a data representation?</a>  I'm not
sure, but its what I intuitively "feel". I can't think of a critical
experiment that can determine this, so it should be good for endless
philosophical debate...at least its not as boring as guns good/guns bad :)
