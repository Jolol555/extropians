I was actually thinking about the verbatim sense: it might kill you,
since you choose not the right strategy because of a wrong model. No rhetorics.

Independent? Not quite. It's just that predicting things grows the
harder the nearer we are near the Singularity. _Of course_ one should
attempt to envision the future decades ahead, just don't expect it's
graven in stone you'll turn out right.

<p>
I can't be sure, that's the reason I mentioned this. The bandwidth of
possible developments suddenly explodes, and you're a sorely put at
assigning probabilities to each individual branch of the multitude.

<p>
As to 'gods are incomprehensible to us', why, yes, I'd say that's a
part of their definition. If I can predict the actions of a posthuman, 
then it is no different from a wind-up toy.
