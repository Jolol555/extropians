Why? If being a postbio intel is all you conditionalize on, this 
doesn't follow. If I knew nothing except that I was a postbio intel, 
I wouldn't expect to be one of the very first; I would expect to be

&gt; of being postbio vs. bio intel.  <br>

<p>
If postbio and bio intelligences all belong to the same reference 
class (just as tall people and short people, black and white etc.) 
then the fact that you find yourself being a bio intel. would 
indicate that the postbios don't vastly outnumber the bios.

<p>
Whether postbios and bios should be in the same reference class is 
not clear. That's a deep problem, and I suspect but am not yet 
certain that there might be some kind of loophole for the 
transhumanist here, if the postbios are fundamentally different</a> from 
bios.

<p>
&gt; In general the validity of the doomsday argument depends on how much detailed<br>
&gt; information one includes about the nature and history of life.<br>

<p>
I don't see why that should be the case.<a name="1496qlink3"> Of course, the exact 
conclusion depends on how you estimate future population figures 
etc., but in general I see the DA as, so to speak, *superimposed* on 
</a>
whatever other evidence you might have.

<p>
<i>&gt;  With the </i><br>
<i>&gt; very stark models that are easy to construct, little info is reflected in </i><br>
&gt; the model, and so the doomsday conclusion bites.  But I think that the <br>
&gt; conclusion bites much less as we put more info into the model.<br>

<p>
That depends on what this info would show. It's easiest to explain 
what I mean if there are only two possibilities: Doom Early, or Doom 
Late. If your prior evidence led you to be extremely certain that 
there was no way that doom could happen soon (no meteories, no germ 
warefare, no black goo, no vacuum decay etc.), then after taking the 
DA into account you might still be fairly certain that Doom Early 
would not happen. (Exactly how certain would depend on how many 
observers Doom Late says there will have been.)

<p>
However,  it doesn't matter how much information you have based your 
empirical prior on. If you have too little information, that should 
be reflected in your priors by setting them closer to fifty-fifty. 
That situation, as far as the doomsday argument is concerned, is 
identical to if you have fifty-fifty priors that are based on a lot 
of information.
