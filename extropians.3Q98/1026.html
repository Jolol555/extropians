 The desire for a good moral system will have some influence on how
those reasons for prejudice are translated into actions.
 My gut feeling has been that the reasons for prejudice are hard enough
to alter that my effort is better spent restraining the results.
 It would certainly be nice to advocate that people train themselves to
switch ot professions X, Y, and/or Z that will still provide reasonable
wages after uploads become common, but I haven't identified such professions
</a>
with enough confidence to justify the effort.
 But now that you have provoked me into thinking about it, I see some hope
that people may be influenced to increase their chances of prospering
in an era of uploads by explaining the advantages of a high savings rate
today.
