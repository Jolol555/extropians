Are you suggesting, though, that if they
were conscious, that *they* would not
<br>
be able to tell themselves apart?  It seems
to me that you are saying that we cannot
tell the difference between two copies
<br>
of an object, if and only if it cannot ever
matter.  But it seems clear that if we 
<br>
could create an exact duplicate of you,
<br>
and shot you or your copy, you would 
<br>
most certainly care which one was shot
<br>
(I hope.  Anyway, *I* would care. :)

<p>
<a href="0406.html#0410qlink2">&gt;&gt; And the reverse, that two separate things</a><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; extremely odd, to me. :-(</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Here's another slant on the same area:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; If you loan me a CD, and I take it to my </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; house and copy it, do you now own two</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; CDs?  I would say not, but perhaps you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; (and anyone who supports intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; property) would say yes?  I am confused</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; as to how your position on IP can agree</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with mine (as I have seen that it does)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and yet the most basic concept involved</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; causes a disagreement... Hm.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We both own a copy the the CD.  They are identical, the same.  That is</i><br>
<i>&gt;what I mean.</i><br>

<p>
But the fact that each copy is 
<br>
owned by only one person
<br>
means that you implicitly 
<br>
recognize that they are not
<br>
the *same* copy, but two 
<br>
separate objects, which happen
<br>
to be identical.
