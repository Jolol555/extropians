Yes, and that kind of chit-chat is important for community forming,
right Anders? ;-)

There has been a split. This is the public list where (almost) anything 
goes. Purely extropian chat on a "select" list requires ExI membership.

<p>
What agenda? 

<p>
Anyway, you might want to check out the transhumantech mailing list
(has only the tech stuff, no chat) or "filtered extropians" which
has only the best postings. See <a href="http://www.transhumanism.com/lists.htm">http://www.transhumanism.com/lists.htm</a>
