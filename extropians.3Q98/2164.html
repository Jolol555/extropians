No, I have never quite understood why people react so strongly to
race, and having a black SO hasn't enlightened me.  I don't mind
being called a racist, as I feel it is next to impossible to engage
in vigorous discussions about economics, politics, or society
without earning that rebuke from someone.  I am rather ashamed that
I am the one who hinted as racism in this case.

<p>
I am eager to correct any and all of my errors.  Unfortunately
grace is not one of my strong points. I will take this episode as
another lesson in how to avoid being ungracious.

<p>
So, I apologize again to Damien and the list for giving anyone an
erroneous impression that I think Damien is a racist.  He clearly
is not a racist and I have never thought him to be one.

Agreed.
