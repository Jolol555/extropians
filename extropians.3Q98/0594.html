This is my thinking on the matter. The only time anyone pulled a
gun on me, there was no way I could have pulled out a gun without
being shot. But if I were within arms' reach...

<p>
The problem, and I thought that was why you were writing the
post, is that guns and gun-control take up a disproportionate
amount of time on this list, and were someone to read it for a
while they may well wind up with a distorted view of what
extropianism is about. Or not.
