The complaint that Leslie is refering to is that the reference class 
should not be unduely *narrowed*, that it would be wrong to leave out 
the pre-Neanderthal people. What you are saying is that the reference 
class should not be *widened* to include postbios. So why do you say 
that you object in exactly the same way as Leslie envisions? As far 
as I know, Leslie has never considered ruling out postbios from the 
reference class on the ground that they would be too different.

<p>
True. The reason why we might want to add it in separately is to more 
clearly see what effect it should have on our belief system.

I look forward to that.

[I should say that the formulae in my "Investigations"-paper 
apparently don't display properly. But it is possible to download the

I also have two shorter papers there.]
