<p>
The story has always been badly misinterpreted. If the first two
pigs had been effective in turning away the wolf, the third pig
would not have had time to complete his house and the wolf
would have plucked him kicking and screaming from his half-built
house.</a>

<a name="0233qlink2">To stretch analogy far past its breaking point, we really need
society as a whole to keep on about its business while the
futurists work out how to make the transition to the posthuman
condition. In return for the service of maintaining society,
the futurists should try to help the remainder of humanity to
make the transition, not scoff at them as a bunch of clueless losers.
