<a name="1506qlink1">While that's certainly a worthwhile route with old technology, it has quite 
a few flaws. Firstly, there's a limit to how far you can reduce the cost

modern satellites; I'm not sure of the mass of an average comsat these days, 
but if it's taken as five tons you'd have to launch ten to a hundred 
satellites per booster!<a name="1506qlink3"> And just imagine putting a hundred billion 
dollar satellites on a booster with a 95% reliability rating; you've just 
added an average of $5,000,000,000 to the cost of every launch, because
one time in twenty you'll lose the whole hundred billion dollar payload.</a>

<a name="1506qlink4">You save a lot of money with an SSTO simply because it can safely abort
in most launch failures without losing the payload.
