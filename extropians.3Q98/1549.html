<p>
The new issue of Business Week (August 31 cover date) is a special double
issue on the 21st Century Economy. The issue focuses on the effects of
advanced technologies on the economy.

<p>
Sample quotation:
<br>
"Going somewhat further out [compared to MEMS]--probably 15 to 20
years--high-tech visionaries foresee a transition that's far more radical
and disruptive. Its quintessence won't be smaller, cheaper, faster
electroniccs--though we will have all that in abundance. The transition
scientists speak of involves nothing less than the hijacking of nature's
own creative machinery.

<p>
In medicine, this spells the ability to repair or replace the body's
failing organs. In manufacturing, it means coercing molecules to asemble
into useful devices--the same way that crystals and living creatures
assemble themselves. The coming wave of miniaturization and molecular
electronics--sometimes called "nanotechnology"--is taking shape at the
intersection of chemistry, physics, biology, and electrical engineering.
And if it crests as many scientists predict, it will bring a wholesale
industrial transformation, more dramatic than the late-20th century
flowering of microelectronics." (p.80)

<p>
This article, and others on various high-tech topics including
biotechnology, don't stop at these general observations, but identify
specific pathways and possibilities.

<p>
Once again, Business Week confirms the mainstreaming of extropian thinking.
