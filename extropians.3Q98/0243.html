<p>
Nick &lt;bostrom@ndirect.co.uk&gt; asked for 5 objections:

<p>
	It's very hard for me to grasp any significant objections so
many seem to have about transhumanism.  Some people seem to work off
of assumtions like there is absolutely no way for man to discover
immortality regardless of how much he progresses.

<p>
	Next, resurrection (or anything better) of those long since
dead, is so much more unimaginable.  And what good is a heaven without
our beloved deceased that gave us that heaven?

<p>
	The human psyche seems to have a fascination of "borg" like
stories.  This seems to feed on itself generating mems of abhorence
towards anything more than human.

<p>
	That's not 5, but it's a start for me.
