<i>&gt;secondly, i failed to realize that the roton system not only obviates the</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;to the gyroscopic rotor.  much weight is saved by using fixed nozzles.</i><br>

<p>
Well, you still need to turn the vehicle in flight. And there's the
possibility of bad force coupling at some points in the flight profile due
to precession.
<br>
But yes, a spun-up Roton won't tend to topple.

<i>&gt;ignoring cost and complication, well, i guess i am the poster child.  {8-]</i><br>

And I apologize if any of my posts seemed patronizing. I wasn't aiming at
you. :)

<p>
<i>&gt; amateur</i><br>
<i>&gt;groups never</i><br>
<i>&gt;deal with liquid rockets: cryopumps and thrust vector control cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt;really be done at a reasonable cost.  </i><br>

<p>
Well, "never" is a big word. Hybrids have never been more active in the
amateur community.

<p>
<i>&gt;i would suggest those who would sell the</i><br>
<i>&gt;roton</i><br>
<i>&gt;concept should emphasize its real strengths.  it is sold as a possible</i><br>
<i>&gt;reentry</i><br>
<i>&gt;body: i still have serious doubts about that.  however, if a launcher is</i><br>
<i>&gt;simple</i><br>
<i>&gt;and cheap enough, why worry about getting it back?  sell it as a means of</i><br>
<i>&gt;lifting raw materials to orbit very cheaply, in the form of rotons.</i><br>
<i>&gt;perhaps a</i><br>
<i>&gt;manufacturing facility could be set up in orbit, and the raw materials</i><br>
<i>&gt;could</i><br>
<i>&gt;be obtained by taking rotons apart, that were launched into orbit just for</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;that purpose.  spike</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
Yep. In fact, there is a wild man in the Midwest experimenting with a
radically simple Roton-inspired design that (at least at first) is just
intended to throw hulls into orbit for use as raw material (and to get him
cred).

<p>
Small ones, something like a hundred kilograms at most.

<p>
And he *is* getting the hang of working with LOX (preparatory to building a
LOX/kerosene hi-rev Roton. Kind of looks like an open-combustor jet
turbine, with O2 assist for when the air gets thin.

<p>
He's also willing to accept a high catastrophic failure rate, at least at
first. No payload, no pilot...
