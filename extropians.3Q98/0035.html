Of course, even if the government violates their
rights it's unlikely that the majority will adopt
these technologies (not that it matters).

In the style of David Brin's _Transparent Society_
it might be an idea to explore the effects of
greater privacy and anonymity in society. When you
can't be sure of anything, what happens? Privacy
creates paranoia, paranoia creates scepticism, and
scepticism creates either insanity or rationality.
Only the rational will survive (or maybe I'm
living in a magical privacy wonderland).

&gt; said to me was good advice, he advised that I<br>
&gt; "SHUT UP!", so I did.<br>

<p>
If you wanted to be really witty, ironic and
clever you could test Brin's theory by posting all
of these embarrassing outbursts to this very
mailing list (or the Amazon.com page for his
book).
