This may be the trend in the U.S., but it doesn't seem to be happening in
Canada. In fact, the inner city area I live in is a lot nicer place today
than it was twenty years ago, and even then it was hardly dangerous. So
from my perspective the trend is hardly inevitable.</a>

When I run out of neighborhoods ;-&gt;  If such a trend did develop, I can
imagine situations in which I would buy a gun. I can also imagine
situations in which I would do other extreme things, but I'm not going to
worry too much about them.  It's silly to underestimate risks, yes, but
over-estimating them is also a mistake.

<p>
Some societies manage to get along quite well without micro-MAD; perhaps
nation states find it it a good policy because there is no real
meta-authority to keep them in line, analogous to legal systems within
nations.</a>
