 But the difficulty is decreasing, and I can't see any major obstacles
to it becoming something that any competent hacker can do (finding you
will become trivial if enough cameras can be created to send a few to
every house; the remaining obstacles are primarily computer vision problems
which are slowly yielding to more research and cpu power.)
 Of course, it isn't obvious whether this will happen before something
like uploading creates more obstacles.

<p>
 Brin's society? He has a bunch of ideas of widely varying quality,
but makes no pretense of having a vision complete enough to be described
as a society.
<br>
 Which of his ideas do you claim require a police state? I can certainly
imagine a basically libertarian society in which virtually everyone was
subject to surveillance.
