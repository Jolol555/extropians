I know what you mean ;-)

<i>&gt; that the odds are that we are halfway along the species' existence.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; we are not a random selection, we are special because this is the first</i><br>

<i>&gt; an era, and for those observers who live in exactly that era, it tells</i><br>
<i>&gt; them nothing about the expected time remaining for their species.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This argument would be a bit stronger if the DA had been discovered more</i><br>
<i>&gt; recently.  However it has only been popularized within the last couple of</i><br>
<i>&gt; years and so we really are the first people to be faced with it.</i><br>

<p>
What you are saying here is basically that the appropriate reference 
class is the set of all observers who know about the doomsday 
argument. With this reference class, the conclusion would be that 
there probably won't be a great many observers who know about the 
doomsday argument in the future. This could either mean that there 
won't be very many observers, or that there will be lots of observers 
but they won't know about the DA.

<p>
And then there is the question whether that is the right 
reference class?

<p>
<a href="1501.html#1522qlink3">&gt; I don't care for formulations of the DA which act as though I might</a><br>
<i>&gt; have been born at different times.  This raises thorny problems about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the meaning of identity, whether I could be said to be the same person</i><br>
<i>&gt; if I were born thousands of years in the future.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1600qlink1">Do you know which second you were born? If not, and you were asked to 
guess, you could repond with a probability distribution over a range 
of seconds. The same with minutes; and it's easy to imagine a 
situation where you suffer from amnesia and you are not even sure 
what year you were born. (That is actually quite common among old 
people in some parts of the world where there were no public records 
of births. That's why claims for longevity records tend to come 
from obscure places.) If you can be uncertain what year, then not 
what decade? Are there any clear limits to how far we can push</a> this 
reasoning?

<p>
<a href="1501.html#1522qlink4">&gt; Rather, it is simpler to say that for most observers the DA will be valid.</a><br>
<i>&gt; However, it will not be valid for those observers who are specially chosen</i><br>
<i>&gt; as being part of a certain milestone in the history of their race - the</i><br>
<i>&gt; discovery of fire, or of writing, or of the DA.  You can easily imagine</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the universe is such that most species do not discover fire halfway</i><br>
<i>&gt; along their history, and the same reasoning applies to the discovery of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the DA.</i><br>

<p>
I think this can be modeled by saying that some people may have 
empirical priors that to some extent compensate for the DA.
