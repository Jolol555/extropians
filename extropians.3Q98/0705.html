Oops, no problem.  I thought you were still talking about the gay rats.

<p>
No.  You keep thinking that if they didn't mate with females and produce
offspring, the gene would die out.  It wouldn't.  If it is indeed a
sex-linked gene on the X-chromosome inherited from the mother's side,
then boys with the gene could be gay (having only one X chromosome),
while girls with the gene would be carriers (having two X chromosomes).
Every generation would have males who don't reproduce, and females who
reproduce resulting in more gay males.  Such a gene would not die out,
even if none of the gay males ever reproduced.
