Er, don't you have to assume a non-zero probability for infinite
universes, and then don't you only get a probability one for infinite?
Things can be possible and have zero prob, and can be prob one without
being certain.</a>

I think I'm having the same problem with all these arguments:

<i>&gt;&gt; become much clearer in the context of specific formal models of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the inferences in question.  Can this argument be formalized?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;P(N=n)=alpha*n	for n&gt;Nmax, P(N=n)=0 ....</i><br>

<p>
No, no,<a name="1618qlink2"> let me explain what I mean by formalize.</a>

<p>
Let us stipulate for now that there are only a finite set of 
possible universes that we can imagine, and that each such 
universe is finite in all important respects.  In this case,
we have very well developed analytical tools for formalizing 
arguments such as the doomsday argument.

<p>
The standard "information partition" approach is to first 
specify a set of possible states, including all possible 
universes and all states a universe could be in.  For each 
state, one identifies all the agents of interest existing
there (including those at different points in space-time). 

<p>
For each agent, one can describe what they know by referring
to the cognitive tools they have for excluding states.  That is, 
given that they are in some state, how can they indentify other 
states that they are *not* in?  If one then applies all their
state-excluding tools and combine all their implications,
then for each state s there is a set of remaining possible 
states P(s) (containing s) that that agent could never exclude.  
And since for every e in P(s), P(e) = P(s), what each agent 
knows can be described by a partition of the set of all states.

<p>
Every valid informational inference of interest can be 
rationalized using such partitions.  So my problem with all your 
DA points is that I have trouble imagining the set of states 
implied, and the relevant agent information parititions which 
rationalize them. When I ask for formalism, this is what I want.

<p>
While one can certainly make valid arguments without formalizing 
them, it is hard to formalize invalid arguments.  So failed 
attempts at formalization suggest sloppy invalid thinking.  My 
current best guess is that the DA is at root incoherent, and so
attempts to formalize it will better reveal this. 

<p>
I found the formal examples in the papers I cites (including
yours) informative, but they all drive me away from the DA.  You
seem to acknowledge these pressures, but end up supporting the DA 
based on informal arguments I just don't get yet.  

<p>
For example, I don't get how determinism vs. indeterminism can be
formalized in terms of partitions, nor can I see how my inability
to forget that I am not a chimp would help me exclude states where
my descendants are numerous.   And I just can't make any sense out 
of your coincidence argument.
