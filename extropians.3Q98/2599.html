assumes

<a href="2592.html#2599qlink2">&gt; I finally obtained this paper and read it last night.  It is a theory paper,</a><br>

<a name="2610qlink1"><a href="2592.html#2599qlink4">&gt; The bottom line is that this paper *assumes* punctuated equilibrium,</a><br>

<p>
Not exactly.  The paper provides a theoretical model for adaptation, which
predicts punctuated equilibrium when adaptive changes to new situations
is involved.  The evidence is not from the paper, but from previous results
on quantitative genetic traits which indicate the effects of genes causing 
differences between species follow an exponential distribution.</a>  I found it
quite impressive that a simple mathematical theory has good agreement
with the evidence.  A quantitative theory of adaptation has been a holy
grail of evolutionary biology for some time, and this may qualify.

<p>
If speciation resulted from isolation and drift, then the Orr model wouldn't
apply and speciation would not be punctuated.
