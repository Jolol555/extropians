Right. For starters, getting germtight suits into mass production and
into everybody's living room and making sure the majority can use them 
(remember the suffocated children in Israel during the Gulf war?)
would mean a lot (well, a great deal more than a working protection
against random asteroid impact). They would also offer excellent 
protection against fallout (how many have sturdy basements, a 
supply of clean water, dehydrated food and a basic medical kit, 
atropine, a dosimeter and iodide tablets included?), and limited 
protection against C weapons. Of course this is semiuseless against 
a sneaky attack with long-latency engineered bioweapons (which will 
need sniffers, and continuous population screeing on viral DNA 
kinetics), and certainly useless against a Gray Goo incident as 
in case of a (spontaneous, or engineered) Blight.

In any case will the effort not be wasted, just think of MDR epidemics 
and reactors gone China.

Well, start a list which distributes only signed, crypted 
stuff (is there a hacked majordomo which does this?), and 
is open only to known members. You're virtually certain to draw
interest from the wrong type of people, then, security included. 
The latter has started to be pretty paranoid since the Aum
et al. type of thing.
