    &gt;My first shot at defining identity is as follows:
    &gt;Identity - A slightly dynamic but mostly stable fuzzy area
    &gt;within</a> he design space of all possible information

processors
<p>
    &gt;as defined by the ego.

I don't know what you mean by "design space", as far as I know
we were not designed. Perhaps you mean the set of all
conceivable
<br>
experiences, but some experiences I can never have, such as the
experience of reading every Chinese book ever written. If my
brain were augmented then I could do it but as I understand your
definition it would be a different ego. Perhaps you mean the
set of all experiences any environment can induce in my
biological body, but that looks like an arbitrary distinction,
the hardware must be restrained but the software can be
anything. It seems to me the two should be treated equally.

<p>
<a name="1919qlink3">Another problem, I'll bet any definition of "ego" will have the
concept of identity  in there someplace, it's the sort of thing
that gives circular definitions a bad name. I'm sure the ego
exists, consciousness too, but the chances that anybody
will ever come up with a definition of either that's worth a
damn
<br>
is almost zero. This doesn't make me despair however because
definitions are vastly overrated, most of our knowledge and all
of the really important stuff is in the form of examples not
definitions.</a>
