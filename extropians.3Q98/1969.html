You can also be generous based on the ol' "Share The Wealth" mentality 
that seeks to demonstrate your success to those you care about in a 
manner that can be universally understandable (i.e. visible material 
wealth that you can afford to dispose of with little thought to 
economic gain).  Although thinking back on it, this is probably more of 
an example of socialism (which can be quite sociable when detached from 
the coercive anti-social cancer that is our current government) than 
altruism (which I see as at best an unnecessary and at worst an evil 
ethical standard).
