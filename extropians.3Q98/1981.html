Abstract
<br>
  There are several hypothalamic theories of
  aging, none of which has been validated. An approach to
  validation is to search for consequences of anatomic ablations of
  hypothalamic regions that are functional hallmarks of aging,
  or consequences of ablation that postpone the appearance of hallmarks of
  aging or extend longevity. Ablation of the hypothalamic
  ventromedial nucleus (VMN) in the weanling rat is associated with subsequent
  increased body fat, glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, and decreased renal
  function. Each of these consequences is characteristic of
  aging in humans and in several animal models of
  aging. Ablation of the hypothalamic dorsomedial nucleus
  (DMN) in the weanling rat leads to a symmetrically smaller animal with normal
  glucose and lipid metabolism, decreased body fat for size, and reduced risk
  of decreased renal function and circulating IGF-I levels. These are findings
  consistent with calorie restriction models in rodents that significantly
  extend life span. This review compares outcomes of lesions in the VMN, DMN,
  and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) for relevance to aging.
  To establish a relationship between these anatomic areas of the hypothalamus
  and aging, it is concluded that the VMN, DMN, and LHA
  lesions should be examined for impact on longevity and compared with data
  obtained from simultaneously studied intact ad-lib-fed and 40%
  calorie-restricted animals. Lesioned animals also should be rigorously
  studied for neurotransmitters (e.g., neuropeptide Y, beta-endorphin,
  serotonin, corticotropin-releasing factor, and galanin), and for behavioral
  changes consistent with aging, for accumulation of specific
  tissue lipofuscin and amyloid that are associated with normal
  aging and for other age-dependent findings, such as
  incidence of tumors and cataract. [References: 220]
