I have noticed in conversations with about half of the more educated 
people I talk to about nanotech that they themselves raise the issues of 
<br>
'upload' and physical space. Our local lad Peter Singer (animal <br>
liberationist) has already suggested 'measures' be taken for population 
control in our paper, The Age, in regards to longevity extension.

<p>
I myself have a fundamentally different point of view. I believe we should 
debate matters for three decades and allow everyone to have access to 
hitech.

<a name="1553qlink1">Some forthcoming posters (it's my hobby currently - I put up 200 or 300 of 
the cover of Damien Broderick's book, for example - and 100 or 200 of 
Tipler's cover)(out of c.7,000, mainly at the 3 large universities).</a>

BAN THE KILLING OF ANIMALS

<p>
VOTE FOR THE UNITED NATIONS [ONE PERSON ONE VOTE]

<p>
NATIONAL SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE FRINGE LAND EMPIRES OF CHINA, INDIA 
AND INDONESIA

GOVERNMENT ELECTRONIC CASH FACILITIES [TO BE PROVIDED IN ADDITION TO 
PRIVATE BANK ELECTRONIC CASH FACILITIES]

UNIFORMS TO BE OPTIONAL, BY LAW

These may not appear to be so transhumanist, unlike most of my earlier 
posters, on celebrating the forthcoming Techno-Rapture and boosting, and 
celebrating telomere therapy and arguing for the provision of lifespan 
extension techniques to all sentient beings, but heck, the 
Escalation/Spike/Singularity requires different flexible strategies to 
apply to a more flexible situation. This is the period in which Toffler's 
Future Shock begins to operate. Non-transhumanists are going to be 
confused and uncertain about strategy in the light of increased ability. 
For example, I have asked various people what degree of medical care they 
would provide were the best possible care available without cost for any 
injured creature. I.e. the principle. I myself would say, if there were a 
horse with a broken leg, I would have it fixed. More than that, in 
principle I would seek its consent, were that possible, prior to fixing 
it. Irrelevent? Certainly not after twenty-two years time, maximum. That 
first five years after nano-year is going to seem massive, to us. All that 
orbital engineering. The politics. The explosion in spiritual movements. 
Wait and see. The nanovirus is complexity itself. We are the viruses. The 
process can no more be contained than Ceaucescu could monitor all the 
telephone calls in Rumania. The logic is, were this universe 
monostructured, conceptual diversity would have been suppressed from the 
worlds of the Techno-Rapture already. Has anyone else done a rough 
calculation of how many of these there are in a Tipler-version finite 
universe assuming carbon-based life began 6.5 billion years after the Big 
Bang? I did, a few years ago. It was a lot. Also, average distances 
between them seemed fairly low, after the first five million years of 
<br>
'graduation'. But my figures are probably way off.<br>

<p>
<a name="1541qlink1">I believe any non-violent action against either:


<OL>
  <li>  killing of sentient beings
  <li>  enslavement of sentient beings, including 'artificial intelligences'
  <li>  restriction of hi-tech (of the non-violent variety)
</a>


</OL>
<p>
is legitimate in the next 30 years.

<p>
<a name="1541qlink2">I also believe that local government and other land areas or social 
networks should be free to democratically choose their systems mix, 
however that may be expressed in prenano political terms.</a>

<p>
Lastly, I believe it is vital that conservatives be permitted to remain 
conservative, even for billenia: with the provisos that meat-eaters can 
consume created cells or consensually-donated cloned cells (I am happy to 
donate cloned meat cells from my body for others to eat, if that makes 
them happy - I am sure that some other beings originally - or still - from 
other species will in future be willing to say the same) and that victims 
of force can be offered protective shielding if they request it.
