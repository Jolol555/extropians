<p>
With anything and everything, especially: (here's where I usually list a
few nifty things humans do, like language, art, music... all of which are
completely artifical.)

<p>
Animals use tools to help them live longer.  Beaver dams leap to mind.

<p>
PLEASE don't answer this question this way.  It sounds like you're saying
"Yes, it will make us less compassionate; in fact, none of us are very in
touch with regular old human compassion to begin with."  Remember, that's
what the word inhuman MEANS: lacking in compassion.  Look it up.

<p>
The correct answer, I think:

<p>
No one is really certain what we'll be like when we become posthuman; 
while some have speculated, there is no obvious evidence to
suggest that posthumans would be any less compassionate than we humans are
today.  While some have argued that posthumans would be as indifferent
toward humans as humans are toward other primates, there are also other
considerations which are harder to take into account.

<p>
For example, right now we tend to overlook the desires and needs of other
animals; perhaps because they do not have the language to demand their
rights or the intellectual capacity to make use of them.  However, all
this would probably change if animals acquired these skills, or if we had
the power to teach them.  It would be much more difficult to perform
painful and/or deadly experiments on laboratory rats if they could provide
a cogent argument in their own defense. 

<p>
Similarly, since posthumans would probably have originally been humans at
one time, or could see a way by which other humans might become
posthumans, posthumans might treat humans differently from other animals,
perhaps even offering humans the opportunity to augment themselves into
posthumanity. 

<p>
As for how posthumans might treat other posthumans, it seems impossible to
speculate.  Would a posthuman, particularly one with better control over
its own mind, have needs of any kind?  Desires?  If so, it's hard to
imagine what precisely they might be; and without some kind of
super-intelligence of our own we probably cannot even begin to fathom how
posthumans might go about fulfilling themselves or how they might react to
the goals of other posthumans.

<p>
<a href="0772.html#0775qlink4">&gt; Are transhumanist technologies environmentally sound?</a><br>

<p>
-Long lived persons have much more to gain from long term investment;
unlike short-lived people, posthumans will live to feel the long term
effects of today's actions, and will be equipped with a superior
intelligence and technology with which they can predict the outcome of
their choices, prepare for the future, and solve difficult problems before
and/or after they have an effect.
