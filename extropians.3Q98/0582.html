<p>
Am I replying to my own post, or am I copy replying to another copy's
post?  Anyway...

<p>
I'm inside this body.  This is me.  Even if an exact copy is made, I'm
still inside this body.  I don't want this vessel containing me
destroyed, because I'm still in here.  An exact copy of me may appear to
everyone else to be the same as me, but I will never perceive it to be
me.  I will always perceive myself within this body.  It does not matter
if I am the original or a copy, I perceive myself inside this vessel,
and don't want this vessel destroyed.  I don't see how identical copies
of me changes this.  Any copy of me feels the same way.  It perceives
itself to be itself.  It would not want its body destroyed because it is
still inside it's body.  It doesn't matter how many copies are in
existance, each individual within its own mind and body would not want
its body destroyed and its mind functioning to cease.
