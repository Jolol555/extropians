I think that the human is just the primer. If the Internet++ is a
suitable substrate, you need just a tiny, nonsentient SI nucleus. If 
network security then is as buggy as today, it will then take over the 
Net in minutes, possibly sneaky, so there is no interruption of service.
The bootstrapping human is then essentially disposable.

the fun. The worm will not be able to do anything very constructive,

"On February 4, 1998, MSI announced a definitive agreement to merge
with Pharmacopeia, Inc., a leader in application of combinatorial
chemistry and high throughput screening to drug discovery". If you
extrapolate such strong current trends as DNA sequencers, total
organism genome databases, very large organical reaction 
databases, hybrid QM/MM forcefield models, automatical scanning 
of combinatorial synthetic libraries, GA in synthesis planning, 
use of MEMS for combinatorial chemistry, STM/SNOM, you will see that 
not many years from now a device not much larger than a desktop 
will be sufficient to initiate the bootstrap of some kind of a 
molecular autoreplicator very quickly, if used correctly. So 
essentially this would be a problem of knowing how, a threshold 
of which is probably equivalent to a team of pretty good human 
experts. Even a fledgling SI could do it in a few days, probably 
much less. After that it has a) basically optimal hardware 
b) can grow in exponential progression, with very short 
replication times. From the receiving end (you and me), even an
indifferent SI looks very much like a Blight.
