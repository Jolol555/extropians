Yep, I agree entirely... the best way to ensure that transhuman ideas get
a good image in the media is to get transhumans into the media. I'm now
putting together my second short film (which isn't transhuman as such, but
is anti-gullibility) and starting to think about ideas for a cheap feature 
next year; with good 3D on PCs I can probably do something interesting for
the video market for very little money. This is why I haven't posted much 
for a year or so; film-making takes a hell of a lot of time.
