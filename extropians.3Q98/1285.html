*Who will be the first transhumans? Thats an easy one. Super wealthy
caucasian capitalists from the United States and Western Europe. They'll
retain some nano-engineers and other necessaries but what about the
other 99.99999% of the population? What is the motivation to offer them
transhuman status? Brotherhood? The same brotherhood that spreads the
technological and material wealth of the present? I think Brandon
Carter's sounding more prophetic all the time.

One can only presume that the level of complexity of the brain, despite 
recent thinking, cannot be fully breached within the 27-35 years prior 
to the Singularity or Escalation. I view current approximations of 
software requirements as hugely underestimated, even given certain 
simpler parameters (de Bono) and nanotech engineering-AI. It is highly 
unlikely that estimates of 2005 for the Singularity are likely. More 
probably it is the congruence of certain events that effects the 
situation on the ground (after all, this is the definition of the 
Singularity on the Internet). That is, as predicted by many, the Nets, 
and SETI, and bootstrapping via bush robot facilities. An AI is most 
amenable to consciously controlled bootstrapping because its 
construction is more modifiable (presumably) and known. My own estimates 
of timeframe escalation indicate a rather different underlying structure 
to the Singularity or Spike as understood currently by Transhumanists. I 
certainly believe that the instrumentality of transformation is one 
being or set of beings and almost certainly an AI, though this is 
largely irrelevent. Structural transformation of thought-processes is 
almost inevitable, as foretold by Transhumanists, but the direction of 
such transformation is the question. Hypersentient self-transforming, 
self-directing beings are likely to exist consciously on a large number 
of chosen levels and to consider issues from a number of wider 
perspectives, including an awareness of the past and the various value 
systems of various emotional states. It is unlikely that such a being 
would consider existance from the point of view of a fixed, 
species-orientated, 20th century capitalist elitist perspective, given 
its innate understanding of its own amortality and abilities. It is 
highly likely that such hypersentient beings would gravitate towards a 
multivalency of experience and possibility and the generation or 
entrance into a multiversal system to provide sufficient possibilities 
for exploration. I would also note that conceptions of memes and 
datavores are inherently entropic and depend on continuous corruption of 
information. Extropic theory holds consciousness to be the spiking 
mechanism towards the control of spacetime, that is, that large aspects 
of the universe become a self-directing organism as well. Old hat, to be 
sure, but interesting. Not entirely scientific, but within a universe 
with a finite number of stars there is a certain amount of sense to a 
certain amount of illusion, the old Star Trek argument about Contact (if 
combined with an existant Omega Matrix a la Tipler - rather than an 
Omega Point at the Big Crunch - unscientific? To be sure. It is a guess 
about behavioural patterning, rather than scientific authenticity). It 
is unquestionably true that earlier post-Singularity civilizations or 
events could if they wish have intervened on this planet at any stage, 
so the issue is why not. The moral issue. There are some, even now, like 
myself, who wish to support all sentient life, all life with 
neurological systems (e.g. a mosquito), and beyond as far as the 
boundary can go, whether it is called process theology or foolishness. 
To focus for a moment back on the issue at hand, I wouldn't worry too 
much about elites of superwealthy nanotechnologists getting ahead of the 
rest. Scientists have a way of mishandling politics that would be almost 
beyond belief, if it were not for the unconscious bubblings of the 
events of the Escalation which make the requirements for some 
suppression of action and understanding more transparent. The primary 
fear of the population at large is almost always lack of physical space 
when the events of the Techno-Rapture are articulated. The secondary 
fear is the existence of only one universe and the necessity of (the old 
version) of entropy (expressed as death, both individual and universal). 
Incidentally, I read that the Sun would have extinguished life on Earth 
within 500 million years, not longer.

THOUGHT EXPERIMENT FOR THE DAY:

<p>
Take the typical population articles and graphs (there's a good one in 
one of the Science Spectras, 1996 I think, by a Russian) for human 
beings and go back with best possible approximations for population, but 
do not arbitrarily and culturally stop at any point. Are there 
fluctuations when breeding populations are splitting off? What are the 
projected or imagined species transpositions between our early 
lemur-like ancestors and unicellular organisms? Amphibians? Fish? It 
would be an interesting graph if it went back 4 billion years instead of 
4 million - and the point is, logically, that is only when we have such 
graphs and comparitive overall and individual graphs for other genetic 
groupings that we can properly conceptualize our genetic landscape. 
(overall biological 'trees' are a start). Perhaps it takes augmented 
bootstrapped intelligence to conceptualize such things. Perhaps it takes 
four or five people a month or two of measuring. I suppose it depends on 
how rough the estimations are. How many people get to add up biomass - a 
similar, if simpler?, issue. [Gaian theorists can also link the human 
population graph to species in culturally symbiotic and resource chain 
relationships with humans. This would tend to bear out the extropic 
spiking mechanism post-Singularity, as also reflected in, e.g. the 
anti-pollutant aspects of clean nanotech.]
