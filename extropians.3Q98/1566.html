<p>
If I were to soundbite extro philosophy, I woudl say that Extros are
techono-rebels.

<i>&gt;please show me the url to this list. I want to follow your example.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I bet that page gets a lot of hits from the Extropians.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I bet everyone at Extropy thinks they are on to something good. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropy appears to be a wonderful, friendly, democratic,</i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding place.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt; I bet the Extropians are a diverse set of people.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1598qlink1">I dunno about that. I would wager that most of the extros &amp; cryos
around these parts were the bookworm types when younger (and even when
older). How about it--any jock types here? ANyone into machine shop
when in high school? :-)
</a>


<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1563.html#1566qlink3">&gt;I hope Extropy isn't too sicky sweet like a honey pot !</a><br>

<p>
No worries there!

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1563.html#1566qlink4">&gt;What are Extropian plans for making society work in a post-human world ? </a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How would a possible Extropian society work ? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We live in a very Darwinian society here in the U.S. I would very </i><br>
<i>&gt;much like to hear how people will be made more equal and how </i><br>
<i>&gt;a better more moral world can be created.</i><br>

<p>
Hmm. I would guess otherwise. Offhand, I would think most Extros are
egalitarian in that they are libertarian, but that equality, per se,
would not be a goal.


<p>
<i>&gt; I bet all the Extropians</i><br>
<a href="1563.html#1566qlink5">&gt;are involved with Animal Rights. Are you ? I am a vegetarian.</a><br>
<i>&gt;I think that is highly Extropic ! Killing animals is highly Entropic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Well, conservation of nature is good, until, that is, mankind has the
tools to remake nature according to his own rules. And we have already
started.



<p>
<a href="1563.html#1566qlink6">&gt;Extropians want to increase Diversity ! </a><br>

<p>
Hmm. In a way, yes, but not in a politically correct way.


<p>
<a href="1563.html#1566qlink7">&gt;Extropians want more Democracy !</a><br>

<p>
Yes.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1563.html#1566qlink8">&gt;Who is vice president at Extropy and when is the next election ?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;People helping people. I love it !</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Super advanced technology is going to make the world good. </i><br>

<p>
Yes, I think so

<p>
<a href="1563.html#1566qlink9">&gt;Everyone is going to be equal !</a><br>

<p>
Possibly, but it may take a long time.

<p>
<a href="1563.html#1566qlink10">&gt;There are too many hateful people in this country who want to </a><br>
<i>&gt;stop diversity. Last week a woman from my office was fired </i><br>
<i>&gt;because she was black. In this day and age. No one told her that</i><br>
<i>&gt;though. They made out she wasn't doing enough work. Shocking </i><br>
<i>&gt;I know. That boss has a bed sheet in his draw. Very entropic.</i><br>

<p>
Well, this may disappoint you, but I would say that Extros think
*merit* should be the predomionant factor in the workplace.


<p>
<a href="1563.html#1566qlink11">&gt;What is the Extropian plan to stop only the elite getting new </a><br>
<i>&gt;technologies ? We have a terrible problem with this in the U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am white and female and money is no problem but if you fall </i><br>
<i>&gt;outside that well you're in trouble. I work in the computer industry. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Advanced lithography at a semi company is my work. Very few</i><br>
<i>&gt;women in the semi industry.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What is Extropy doing to address the dark side of these new</i><br>
<i>&gt;technologies ? I bet you are all aware of the issues and are </i><br>
<i>&gt;working to make sure those kind of situations do not happen.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You Max must already be leading the project team with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;objective of sharing the wealth. What is the name of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;project team ?</i><br>

<p>
I can hardly wait for other responses to this!
