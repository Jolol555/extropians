This component of the FAQ needs *excruciating* sensitivity.  Almost
everyone has a gag reflex at this suggestion.  I wonder (dunno if it makes
bio-botanical sense) if the suggestion might be better expressed as: if we
could design plants and vegetables that include certain animal genes, we
might be able to `grow steaks' in the same way we now grow tomatos or
lettuces.  [If that *doesn't* make sense for energetic reasons, we need to
rephrase the brainless cows scenario more delicately.]</a>

Careful!  Whimsical homour is not read as such by believers - and there are
always nitwits who would quote such a line as proof that &gt;H believe in
deity but pit themselves against Him/Her/It!

Many readers are non-mathematical.  You need to explain this a bit, even if
only by providding examples of the two progressions.
