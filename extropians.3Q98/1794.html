Sentists, and some other transhumanism-like groups, appear to be 
basically mystical: knowledge about the future can be achieved through
non-rational insight.

American historical condition, the 50 million Americans who live in 
wretched poverty and the fact that traditionally they have appropriated 
other people's lands by force (like most societies, including 
Australia). I can only hypothesize that they see physical space as 
limited - and possibly virtual space as well - and therefore wish to 
scramble to the top of some hypothesized 'heap' before the rest. This 
partially explains their lack of spiritual or MORAL discussion or 
ETHICAL discussion regarding various issues, although extropian means 
growth-orientated and positivistic to me. Only for everyone.
