                ZEROING IN ON IDENTITY

                 - Identity Defined -

</pre>
<p>
    Identity defines the fundamental nature of every 
    thing, whether that thing is an objective physical 
    entity or a subjective mental construct. To understand
     the nature of things we must first understand
     the nature of identity. 

<p>
    Exceeding the standard definition of identity as 
    just "self-similarity," the structure of identity 
    expresses a duality of (1) self-similarity and (2) 
    other-difference, since we can say that a thing (a 
    part of all) is the same as itself if, and only if, 
    we can say it is different than something else. As 
    we shall see, these two aspects of identity create 
    Absolute and Relative identity attributes. This 
    then is the dual definition of identity:


<p>
      DEFINITION OF IDENTITY: 

<pre>
      (1) ABSOLUTE: zero difference; the uncondi-
      tional nature of a thing that is not derived 
      from external relation; the product of inter-
      nal self-similarity. Example: She must be 
      Mary since she is the same as Mary. 

      (2) RELATIVE: nonzero difference; the condi-
      tional nature of a thing, n, derived from the 
      difference between n and not(n);  the product  
      of external other-difference.  Example: Smith 
      is best since he scored more than the others.


</pre>
<p>
    The identity of a thing is simultaneously (1) and (2). 
    Example: the difference between 4 and 4 is 0 (4 is the 
    same as 4) because the difference between 4 and 0 is 4. 
    So a thing, n, is defined at the same time by both its 
    similarity to itself and by its difference from not(n); 
    and thus  difference (from zero difference to nonzero 
    differences) defines the whole structure of identity.


<p>
    SYNTHETIC IDENTITY ANALYSIS

<p>
    Numbers are  synthetic identities  that serve as ideal 
    subjects for the study of identity. It is because they 
    are the ideal model of identity structure that numbers 
    and their relations, while synthetic, are unparalleled 
    in their ability to model the natural world.

<pre>
            "Treat the laws and relationships 
              of integers like those of the 
             celestial bodies." George Cantor

</pre>
<p>
    The structure of identity is ideally expressed as a 
    numeric scale of difference from  zero to infinity. 
    Zero is no difference, or similarity, and all other 
    numbers to infinity are degrees of difference defined
     by their difference, or displacement, from zero.

<pre>
                   0____1____2____3...

                   scale of difference
                   scale of identities

</pre>
<p>
    Each number-identity along the continuum is defined 
    by its difference from zero  (n - 0 = n),  which defines
     the  Primary Relative (PR) identity attribute 
    of an identity. For example, 3 is 3 because 3 is 3 
    more then 0. A number n also has Secondary Relative 
    (SR) identity attributes, which express the difference
     between n and other numbers that are nonzero. 
    We can see this in the differentiation matrix below.

<pre>
        PR = Primary Relative identity attribute
        SR = Secondary Relative identity attributes
        AI = Absolute Identity attribute

</pre>
<p>
    Listed in the vertical column below each number on 
    the top of the matrix below are its identity attributes
     as  derived  from  relations  to the numbers 
    listed along the left side. The identity attributes 
    derived from the relation of two numbers are found 
    at their intersections (fixed-pitch font required):


<pre>
                        0  1  2  3
                       ____________
                    0 | 0  1  2  3 |
<br>
<i>                      |            |</i><br>
                    1 |-1  0  1  2 |
<br>
<i>                      |            |</i><br>
                    2 |-2 -1  0  1 |
<br>
<i>                      |            |</i><br>
                    3 |-3 -2 -1  0 |
                      --------------

               Using number 3 as our example:

               Attributes of 3: (3,2,1,0)
               by relations to: (0,1,2,3)

               PR of 3 is 3 relative to 0
               SR of 3 are (2,1) relative to (1,2)
               AI of 3 is 0 relative to 3 (self)

</pre>
<p>
    Example of SR attribute: 3 is 2 more than 1. "3 is 2 
    more" is a statement about the identity of 3 relative 
    to 1, thus  "2 more"  is a SR identity attribute of 3. 
    In the same way,  "Smith is 2 feet taller"  defines a 
    SR identity attribute (+2ft) that belongs to Mr Smith 
    relative to Mr Jones.  Smith is also  4 feet  shorter 
    (-4ft) than an elephant just as 3 is also 6 less than 
    9. Therefore, a thing, n, has as many SR attributes 
    as there are other things n can be related to, yet 
    n only has one PR attribute, n. 

<pre>
        PR = Primary Relative identity attribute
        SR = Secondary Relative identity attributes
        AI = Absolute Identity attribute

</pre>
<p>
    The AI attribute of each number (found at its intersection
     with itself in the  differentiation  table) 
    and the AI of all numbers is zero. Therefore 

<p>
       0 = (AI of 1) = (AI of 2) = (AI of 3) = 0. 

<p>
    It is the relative identity attributes derived from 
    holistic relations that define a thing as a unique 
    subset of the whole. Self-similarity is Absolute 
    identity, it is the "home base" of "self," and, 
    being a null relation, is equal to zero. 

<p>
    The zero of Absolute identity defines the Buddhist 
    claim about identity, that the inherent (i.e., the 
    absolute) self-nature of all things is void (i.e., 
    is zero), and that what we think of as the thing 
    is merely a product of conditional relations. So
    that central Buddhist teaching is not "mystical."


<p>
    CONCLUSION

<p>
<a name="2642qlink1">    The analysis of synthetic numeric identities herein
     allows us to see and  thereby  prove: (a) that 
    identity is conserved, expressed via the real numbers
     as a constant zero-sum, since, for example, n 
    is always as much more than x as x is less than n; 
    (b) that identity is  therefore  symmetrical; (c) 
    that Relative identity is holistic, since all nonzero
      identity  attributes are derived from otherdifference;
     and (d) that the Absolute (nonrelative) 
    identity of each and every thing equals zero.

    WHY DIFFERENCE DEFINES IDENTITY ===================

</pre>
<p>
    Impressed by the complex we overlook the simple, we 
    associate simple with that which we must pass beyond 
    in our quest for the ultimate understanding and truth. 
    Yet, just as the complex structures of a fractal design
     come from an infinite repetition of a relatively 
    simple primary form, infinite complexity comes from 
    the primary simplicity of difference, from zero 
    difference (similarity) to infinity... 

<p>
    The numbers along the real-number line express progressive
     displacement, or additional difference, relative
     to zero, the origin. Each number is its separation,
     displacement, or difference, from zero, 
    thus n is exactly n more than 0. So the essential 
    nature of an identity is a state of difference.
 
<p>
    If there was no difference, there would be no numbers,
     and if there were no numbers, there would be 
    no mathematics. Before you can build a mathematical 
    statement, first you need numbers, which are states 
    of difference. The same principle holds for physical  
    things, which are also states of difference, such 
    that no difference implies no things. So the fundamental
     nature of identity and thus of all things is 
    that of difference, from zero difference to infinity...

<p>
    Therefore, difference, expressed as subtraction, is 
    unique among all mathematical operations in that only 
    difference defines the primary causal structure of 
    identity.  The  scale  of  difference, from zero to 
    infinity defines the causal  structure of identity, 
    of what it is that  makes a thing  what it is, and 
    thus the differentiation table is the template that 
    defines the foundation identity and existence.
