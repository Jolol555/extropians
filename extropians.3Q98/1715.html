<a href="1706.html#1715qlink1">&gt;&gt; OK, so "The Original" is just a name, of no greater significance</a><br>
than
<br>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink2">&gt;&gt; any other name, #87 for example.</a><br>



<p>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink3">&gt;Its a name that determines your assignment and weather or not you</a><br>
have
<br>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink4">&gt;been slated for voluntary short term memory suicide in 10 hours.  So</a><br>
<i>&gt;its a little more than just a name.</i><br>

<p>
I, Mr.87 am slated to die but that fathead Mr. Original is not, he's
going on a luxury vacation instead, that's a hell of a difference and
if
<br>
it's not enough to make the two diverge in a hurry nothing will.  Mr.
Original made the assignments and I note he didn't say he and 99
copies would blow their brains out and Mr. 87 would be the one to
achieve immortality and live the good life forever, personally I think
that would be a much better plan.

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Me</i><br>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink5">&gt;&gt; I still don't understand, why should I look at my name tag, other</a><br>
than
<br>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink6">&gt;&gt; pure curiosity what useful information would I gain by doing so ?</a><br>


<p>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink7">&gt;You are the one that designed the temporary spawning process.</a><br>

<p>
That wasn't me that was Mr. Original and he doesn't know what it's
like to face the prospect of immediate death, I do and I don't like it
one bit.

<p>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink8">&gt; Why would you ignore your own intentions.</a><br>

<p>
It doesn't really matter why, the fact is I am ignoring them, so
obviously they can no longer be my intentions even if Mr. Original
still
<br>
thinks it's a wonderful

<p>
<i>&gt;Of course you would look at the name tag, this is part of the plan.</i><br>

<p>
The plan sucks.

<p>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink9">&gt;This is how you know what work you've been assigned and if</a><br>
<i>&gt;your slated for voluntary short term memory suicide in 10 hours.</i><br>

<p>
Let Mr. original kill himself if he wants but I do NOT volunteer.


<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Me;</i><br>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink10">&gt;&gt; It wouldn't matter if my tag said "The Original" or "#87",</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'd still rather have the other fellow blow his brains out not me.</i><br>



<p>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink11">&gt;With the exception of 10 hours divergence, the other fellow is you.</a><br>

<p>
Besides that Mrs. Lincoln how did you like the play.

<p>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink12">&gt;none of the copies will deviate from the plan.</a><br>

<p>
The basic problem is that all the copies are identical yet you're
asking them to behave in radically different ways.

<p>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink13">&gt;death does not equal 10 hours of amnesia.</a><br>

<p>
Perhaps not because survival is not an all or nothing matter, but it
would be close enough to death to make me profoundly unhappy.

<p>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink14">&gt;You've just completed 10 hours of mundane work at the office today in</a><br>
<i>&gt;your normal biological state.  You then documented your work more</i><br>
<i>&gt;thoroughly than ever before.  A doctor shows up and completely</i><br>
<i>&gt;convinces you beyond any shadow of a doubt that he has invented a</i><br>
<i>&gt;flash light type device that can induce a perfect 10 hour amnesia</i><br>
with
<br>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink15">&gt;no side effects whatsoever.  You are 100% convinced this is safe and</a><br>
<i>&gt;effective.  He offers you $10,000 to let him use the device on you.</i><br>


<p>
As you say it's a judgment call but I'd tell him no way.


<p>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink16">&gt;P.S.  Has anyone on this list verified the signature on the message</a><br>
<i>&gt;where John Clark changed his public key?  After more than three years</i><br>
<i>&gt;of reading his post with mostly just minor disagreements, all of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;sudden, one week after changing his public key this major</i><br>
disagreement
<br>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink17">&gt;about the fundamentals of identity pops up.</a><br>

<p>
Nobody can claim absolute consistency so perhaps something I said in
my most recent post contradicts something I said in an older one, I
don't know what it could be but I'd love to find out, please
illuminate me.


<p>
<a name="1716qlink13"><i>&gt;Even if it [My key] verifies correctly, I would still suspect</a> the</i><br>
possibility
<br>
<a href="1706.html#1715qlink18">&gt;that he sold his reputation by means of selling his private key.</a><br>

<p>
If I bought John Clark's key then the person you're talking to now is
not the same person that has been on the Extropian and Transhuman list
for years, but if I bought it then why am I using a different key?
Actually I would have sold out years ago except that nobody made me an
offer.

<p>
My Old Public key signed with my Old Secret Key and then signed with
my New Secret Key.
