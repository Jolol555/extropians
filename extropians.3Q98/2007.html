current tech) you just _can't_ ship enough food to feed a country.</a>

The United States is responsible for roughly 1/3 of the world's food
production and virtually every country in the world relies on US
agriculture for part of their food supply.  The US stores very little for
emergency purposes (and for most scenarios, doesn't need to).  Your "50
million Americans living in poverty" is a highly suspect figure.  I grew up
among the lowest strata of the "poverty" segment in the US population (i.e.
I lived in a shack on an Indian reservation with marginal utilities access
and none of the luxuries that most "poor" people have, such as TV), but
nonetheless we never starved.  Food is abundant in this country, even for
the poorest of the "poor".  The truly starving in this country are starving
because of reasons completely outside the socio-economic realm.
