I meant ON. Let's see if I can make this clearer. For a thousand years say,
Capitalism gets its reporting structure into place, right? Ok, now I propose a
neuronomy without visible means of support structures, but a neuronomy is like an
opposition government that hasn't ever governed and doesn't know the truth of the
situation. In starting to discuss what a neuronomy is capable of can it be taken
for granted that none of the structure can be in place before it is modeled? If so
then I propose learning what a neuronomy can do by taking each component of
capitalism and rewording it to fit an AI engine. I hadn't wanted to do this as I
consider a neuronomy to be still decades away, but at your insistence I compiled
the following juxtaposition as an example. I used my knowledge of the Ingrid cycle
to create a new definition of a decision from a text book definition of an
investment. I did this in order to remove the concepts of funds, time, interest
and inflation. I'm sure that such a process could apply throughout and you would
end up with a complete philosophy that did not use money.

<p>
Definition of a Decision:

<p>
The continuing effort to grade something in order to identify structures that will
guide (1) in creating a consensus, (2) while allowing for emergencies, and (3)
also for the refinement of other projects.

<p>
Definition of an Investment:

<p>
The current commitment of funds for a period of time in order to derive a future
flow of funds that will compensate the investing unit (1) for the time the funds
are committed, (2) for the expected rate of inflation, and (3) also for the
uncertainty involved in the future flow of funds.
