<p>
I'm not sure that a global system is feasible, possible, or even 
desireable.  An important aspect of this is that the power signals 
worldwide are split between 50 &amp; 60 Hz.

<p>
But it doesn't matter.

<p>
The production of power should be localized such that the need for
big ol' power plants is minimized because so many people produce
energy themselves for their own usage and for sale.

<p>
Personal power production should and will become as important in the
future as personal transportation is now.

<p>
<a href="1737.html#1741qlink2">&gt; AC has one big advantage over DC - the voltage can be simply raised</a><br>
<i>&gt; and lowered with transformers to allow transmission of power over</i><br>
<i>&gt; long distances. There have been a (very) few high voltage DC</i><br>
<i>&gt; transmission lines - the one I remember most is a coaxial cable from</i><br>
<i>&gt; England to France that transfers power from whoever has the surplus</i><br>
<i>&gt; to who needs it. There's a bidirectional HV inverter on each end of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cable to connect to that countries' AC grid.</i><br>

<p>
The generating utility that stands behind the d&amp;t utility from which
I buy my power from has a big ol' DC line running from a huge power 
plant in central North Dakota to the east side of Minnesota. I would 
guess that this line runs at least 400 miles (640 km).

<p>
<a href="1737.html#1741qlink3">&gt; If fuel cells or some breakthrough in home nuclear power becomes</a><br>

<a name="1742qlink1">Don't forget windmills. We will soon be entering a time when the
technology used for wind turbines will allow them to be used in
more places than thought possible and for a cost that will allow
people and normally energy consuming businesses to have one for
themselves.
