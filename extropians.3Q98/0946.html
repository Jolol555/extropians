I can't parse 'wet'. Water is a property of the macro/mesoscopic, not the
molecular level. Is consciousness an emergent property of molecular
level? Of course. Is consciousness an emergent property of an unique 
molecular configuration? Don't think so. Even if was, it would not invalidate
the possibility of uploads at a low enough simulation level.

It would make an audible bang: if you were part of the simulation. 
A simulated nuclear explosion does not incinerate the machines at 
Sandia labs, but it doesn't mean their results are inapplicable 
to reality. Yours is a classical fallacy: mixing the simulated and 
the simulation environment.
