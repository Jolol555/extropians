*I* don't think he was...
<br>
I dunno where den Otter lives, but here
<br>
in the US, that is a prevailing attitude 
toward victims of crime, especially
<br>
among legislators and many police.
<br>
After being robbed at gunpoint a few
<br>
years ago, I was told by the detectives
<br>
on the case the same day that they
<br>
felt that *I* had staged the whole thing
to make trouble.

<p>
<a href="0081.html#0103qlink2">&gt;It's an extropian meme in the US perhaps, due to necessity reasons (not</a><br>

isn't in
<br>
<a href="0081.html#0103qlink3">&gt;coutries with more stringent gun laws (and, maybe consequently, lower</a><br>
<i>&gt;death rates due to violent crime).  Looking in from the outside, it</i><br>
appears
<br>
<a href="0081.html#0103qlink4">&gt;to me that the US has found itself in a self-induced positive feedback</a><br>
<i>&gt;condition.  Preventing a country or region from entering this worrying</i><br>
<i>&gt;state appears to be a more rational course of action - though if you're</i><br>
in
<br>
<a href="0081.html#0103qlink5">&gt;a country lilke the US you may not have much choice but to choose gun</a><br>
<i>&gt;ownership.</i><br>

<p>
There is a feedback loop at work, though perhaps
not of the sort you imagine.  Here is how it works,
over a cycle of 5-10 years:  Legislators pass new
gun control laws in the name of preventing crime;
crime increases due to the lesser availability of
guns to potential victims; legislators cry over
towering crime rates and pass more gun legislation.
In general, it seems that if you feel that people
are generally more apt to use a gun to defend
themselves against crime than to commit it,
you favor proliferation of guns.  If you feel that
people in general are only waiting for firepower
to commit as many crimes as they can, you
favor gun laws.
