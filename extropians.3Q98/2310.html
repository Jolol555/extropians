<p>
<a name="2311qlink1">The idea was to have Vinge here to flesh out and defend his claims.  
If he can't or won't, then I would be content to at least create a consensus
that he hasn't supported his vision with a coherent analysis.</a>   

<p>
<a name="2311qlink2">Your analysis seems to me to be based on unusual enough assumptions that it 
can't really stand for what Vinge probably meant, but didn't get around to 
saying.  It also seems opaque enough that in discussing it, one spends more 
time trying to understand Eliezer's concept of singularity, rather</a> than 
Vinge's.

<p>
I asked about *Vinge's* singularity concept, exactly to avoid this elephant
that becomes all things to all people.</a>
