The higher level code spoken of here are called the "homeotic genes" that do
code for the body plan of - as far as is known - every organism in the
animal kingdom.  These genes are, of course, regulatory genes and are still
DNA but they do code at a "higher level".  I think after comparative
genomics are done on other animals this IS what will allow humans to
genetically program themselves to transcend their current biological
limitations as Transhumanism (and I) desire.  See some others explain
homeotic genes (guys with Ph.D. and such) from a few links I have collected:

"All people dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty
recesses of their minds wake in the day to find it was vanity. But the
dreamers of the day are dangerous people, for they may act their dream with
open eyes to make it possible."  -T.E. Lawrence
