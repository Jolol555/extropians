<a name="0873qlink5"><a name="0842qlink1"><a name="0821qlink1">During the upload discussion, many people claimed that if two objects
were identical except for location, that they were the same object.</a>  Not
just two of the same type of object, but literally the same object.
</a>They would be counted as one object.  The claim applied to an original
and an exact duplicate upload in the same room.<a name="0843qlink1">  Some claim that there
</a>
is only one person,<a name="0843qlink2"> one body, one brain, one physical entity.</a>
</a>

<p>
The seems irrational to me.<a name="0843qlink3">  We know that atoms are interchangeable.</a>
<a name="0843qlink4">All hydrogen atoms, for example, are identical.</a>  Any two hydrogen atoms
can be switched with no discernible effect.

<p>
<a name="0866qlink1"><a name="0843qlink5"><a name="0821qlink2">Does this mean that there is only one hydrogen atom in the entire
universe?</a>  One helium atom?  One of each of about 100 elements,</a> meaning
the entire universe consists of about 100 atoms?<a name="0843qlink6">  This seems to be
</a>
mysticism at its best, claiming that we are all one, and that
distinctions between me and thee are illusions.  This is the first time
I have heard this theory outside religious mysticism.  Do other
extropians really feel this way?
