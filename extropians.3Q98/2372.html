<a name="2377qlink1">Quantum computing does extend the class of problems known to be solvable
in polynomial time, but it does not establish that P=NP using such
machines.  Factoring has not been shown to be NP-complete.</a>

<a name="2377qlink2">Robin Hanson had an interesting article on the polymath list speculating
that quantum computing could theoretically speed up AI very dramatically.
This only works if AI can be expressed as a massive search problem,
consolidating many small problems into very large superproblems.  Search
of n items for an optimum can be done in sqrt(n) time using QCs so it
is necessary to work on very large problems to get effective speedups.</a>

<p>
Note though that a reduction from n to sqrt(n) does not cross the boundary
between polynomial and super-polynomial complexity.  If search problems
have exponential growth trees, a quantum computer can look twice as far
down the tree, roughly speaking.  But the QC still faces an exponentially
growing problem.
