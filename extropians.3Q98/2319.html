Have you actually read "Frankenstein"? The flaw was in the manufacturer,
not the monster!

<i>&gt;you'd think:  "My God, look what happens when robots go unrestrained!  We'd</i><br>
<i>&gt;better make extra sure to slap more coercions on them."  That the robots go</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
Coercions make people insane too.

<p>
One remark: Coercion exists. It works. If it didn't, evolution would have
eliminated it long ago. In many areas, coercion results in one trial
learning. A rat which eats bad food learns to avoid the food ever after.
The rat NEVER eats that food again. This has some advantages in some
situations.
