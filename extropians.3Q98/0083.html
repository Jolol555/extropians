Since Distance = ((acceleration/2)*time^2) + (starting velocity * Time), also
shown as

<p>
S=(a/2)t^2+v(0)t

<p>
a = 1g = 9.8m/s^2
<br>
t = 1 year = 31,536,000 seconds
<br>
v(0) = 0

<p>
Distance traveled at 1 g acceleration equals 4,873,000,000,000,000 meters

<p>
Since light speed is 300,000 km/s, a light year (distance light travels in one
year) is 9,460,800,000,000,000 meters.

<p>
So you would travel approximately 0.5 light years in the first year. However
this is not very important. What is important is the velocity you attain.

<p>
Since velocity = acceleration * time, or V=a*t, at the end of one year's
acceleration at one gravity, you would be traveling at 302,745,600 meters per
second.<a name="0131qlink1"> Since this velocity is higher than light speed, you cannot obviously
reach this velocity. Instead, as you get closer to light speed, two things begin
to happen. A) your vehicle becomes steadily</a> heavier, and B) Time in the rest of
the universe, as observed by the crew of the ship, seems to speed up, while to
people on earth observing the crew, time on ship would be observed to be slowing
down. This is known as time dilation, and is an interstellar astronaut's best
freind. I don't have the equations handy to factor in these relativistic
effects, but rest assured that at the end of one year's travel at one G
acceleration, one month to you is actually approximately one whole year to the
rest of the universe, so you can traverse one light year in what seems to you to
be just one month. Thus, accelerating for what seems to you to be two years,
then turning around and decellerating for another two years will get you
somewhere around 20-25 light years, as I recall. If anyone would like to make
some more exact calculations for an annual ship time calendar, please be
welcome....
