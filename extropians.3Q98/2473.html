It *doesn't* exist, I was making a proposal to create the "Human
Memeome Project".  Also, If you don't exclude adult sites, your data
mining effort will conclude that the most popular of all human memes
is "free nude teen pics".</a>  The next 100 down the list will be similar.
<a name="2474qlink2"> There is plenty of adult information in personal web sites and I
believe that to be more representative of a human individual than
people looking to make a quick buck.  Those sites represent someone's
effort to influence others to spend, not someone's effort to publish
their personal memes on the web.

No, lets say you wanted to collect a snapshot of a specific class of
memes e.g. (idioms/buzz words/catch phrases/figures of speech).  Since
most of these phrases are between three and six words, you could start
searching for multiple matches from the greater web of every group of
three to six words you encounter on the web site that is currently
being scanned.  Certainly, you would need a super-search engine as a
tool to accomplish this.  But the output would be a list of catch
phrases that are common in the meme pool.</a>
