Certainly I'd know which person I was, I'd be the one who was staring at 
something that looked and acted just like me. If the room had no windows had 
cylindrical symmetry and both bodies were standing an equal distance from the 
center then there would only be one conscious being in the room. If I  wanted 
to complicate things a little more I could, just for fun, extend the optic 
nerve, perhaps by some radio link, so that the image that the eyes one body 
received would be sent to the brain in the body of the other, but absolutely 
nothing would change because the signals were identical.

<p>
If the room did not have cylindrical symmetry then the information they 
received from their senses would be different so they'd diverge and there 
<a name="0781qlink1">would be two conscious being in the room. Both would think they</a> were 
John Clark and both would be correct.
