HEROIN, ILLEGALITY AND INTERNAL FREEDOM
<br>
Avatar Polymorph

<p>
The question of the legality of heroin is one that has been frequently 
addressed by many commentators, and relates directly to the alleged 
social and moral implications of heroin usage. I have injected heroin a 
number of times. I can see little connection between its effects and the 
alleged social and moral implications of heroin usage put forward by 
anti-legalisation commentators. I can, however, see quite direct 
connections between its addictive qualities, its expense and the actions 
of those heroin takers who are addicted to it. If cigarettes were banned 
tomorrow I believe you would find tobacco smokers behaving like heroin 
addicts very shortly thereafter. That is, paying large amounts of money 
for an illegal substance and, if relatively poor, stealing and acting as 
sex workers for quick cash. As a former packet a day smoker, I remember 
selling books and records in desperation when my income level was low, 
in common with many artists. 

<p>
The reality of this situation is very much obvious, even to conservative 
commentators. There are a number of hidden or unspoken agendas at work.


<OL>
  <li>  Heroin use is perceived as a social threat because it does involve 
new and altered states of consciousness, which are linked to the drug 
and alternative cultures.

  <li>  Heroin use is labelled particularly 'bad' as it allows for 
concealment of the lack of compassion on the part of conservative 
commentators. These commentators laud positivism and 'life' while 
accepting all sorts of adverse consequences flowing from the current 
hypocrisy. In the case of the illegality of heroin, these commentators 
rarely mention the growing numbers of deaths and illnesses and slow 
deaths stemming from the illegality of heroin. I have held the hand of 
an overdose victim suffering an epileptic fit on Smith Street [a 
Melbourne heroin centre] - one who stole from me once - while corrupt 
police drove by, those same police who mouth platitudes. Unknown dosages 
and contaminated syringe usage are the physical problem, not heroin 
itself. Conservative commentators claim to be worried about the 
addiction, rather than the social challenge of alternative ways of 
thinking.


</OL>
<p>
My personal viewpoint on these matters is two-fold. Firstly, I would 
assert, as a general principle, that every person has the right to 
control their own bodies, provided that they are not directly hurting 
another. This includes the right to take drugs, whether poison, 
nicotine, heroin, caffeine, marijuana, LSD or any form of medication or 
therapy. This would make non-consensual smoking in the immediate 
vicinity of non-smokers or the provision of alcohol to a violent and 
aggressive person who is already drunk things to be avoided.

<p>
Secondly, I would suggest that research be done to create a form of 
non-addictive heroin. While there may be physical limitations to 
chemical alteration of heroin, the existence of neurotransmitters 
similar in structure to opiates points to the viability of such a 
possibility. This would increase the options for heroin users and 
clarify the real issues involved. Similar research could be done for 
nicotine and addiction, and perhaps also its cancerous effects. 
Governments in general would currently oppose such research, just as 
they oppose research into LSD. The importance of this issue will not go 
away. It is a matter of general principle. The denial of legal heroin by 
conservatives, and specifically by the police - as I can attest to 
personally from my experience in government circles - is symbolic. 
Removal of the addictive element would help clarify the debate.

<p>
It is possible that conservatives will shortly seek to restrict access 
to genetic therapies, genetic splicing and intra-cellular 
nanotechnology. It is a fundamental moral and spiritual right to control 
your own body, up to and including suicide. What does the future hold? 
In a world where advanced automation and nanotechnolgy are about to 
remove the necessity for manual work and capital, it will be possible to 
manufacture drugs within the body and experience altered states of 
consciousness continuously. This is one option open to people, and a 
legitimate one. Conservatives may attempt to restrict this option, and, 
indeed, go further, by attempting to control the neurological 
consciousness of others against their will, the 'Big Brother' approach. 
This is the wider context of the issue of opiates, other currently 
illegal recreational drugs and altered states of consciousness. The same 
people who tell us that the death of others is better than controlled 
provision of heroin may, in two decades time, be arguing that designer 
neurotransmitters and direct access to the Internet - via optical and 
aural nerves - should be restricted and monitered by the government. The 
championing of choice, begun in the 1960s by such prophets and moral 
teachers as Timothy Leary, will, however, continue, and is attested by 
the positive attitude of youth towards freedom of exploration.
