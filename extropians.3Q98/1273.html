 My understanding is that GH-3 is effectively the same as a supplement marketed by
Twinlabs as DMAE H3 dimethylaminoethanol and PABA. Available in tablets or (my
choice 'cause you can put it in coffee--the coffee kills the taste and gives you a
synergistic boost. I've been taking the stuff for years. I've been taking a large
dose of pantothenic acid followed ( not less than to 2 hours later) by a couple of
droppers of DMAE H3 in a cup of coffee. They react with one another to form
acetylcholine. Gives you a decent memory boost or anti-drowsiness substance. The
two hour wait is needed so that they don't react in your stomach. (gut pain like
the flu) Side effects include the previously mentioned stomach pain if you're not
careful. Also if you have any tendenancy toward myospastic back or torticolis you
might want to take it real easy as the combination increases muscle tone bodywide,
along the spine in particular. Headache is another common side effect. You can
adapt to the combination if you gradually increase your dosage, that minimizes the
negative effects.
<br>
 As for CERI I only know what I read, but I found the same website as you just a
few weeks ago. After reading the interviews and articles about treating
Parkinsonism with antioxidants and the article that explores the biochemistry
behind that therapy, I resolved to try a similar shotgun of antioxidants approach
on myself. I have no major illnesses, but I will turn 50 on my next birthday and
although I've been taking a fair amount of vitamins (C, E, multiple vitamin and
mineral supplements, the DMAE) I'd started to notice that my long, stressful
workdays ( I do MRI scans to put food on the table) were beginning to take their
toll on me. I picked up abottle of something called Super 10 Antioxidant by
Country Life. Has most of the compounds mentioned in the article and I added some
Lipoic acid and decided to take 1/2 gm of Pantothenic acid each time I took the
other two.
<br>
 For me, that combination works like nothing else I've ever tried. My energy level
is up as a rough guess between 30 to 50 %. The effect is not that of a stimulant,
it feels more like that of an antidote. I've experienced what feels like an
increase in my metabolism--I feel hotter but the thermometer says that I have the
old 98.6. The mix doesn't appear to induce a fever, just increase energy
production by reducing free radical mitochondrial damage. I run for fitness and my
running performance is up. One warning, I'd been taking that DMAE on a regular
basis-- after starting on the antioxidant mix I found that I had to lower my
intake of DMAE quite a bit. It works too well? with that in the mix and the effect
goes from wonderful to unpleasant. Hope I was of help.
