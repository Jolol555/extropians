yes, that would be interesting, perhaps moreso than gender and preference:
how many pets do extropians own?

i make my living mining data in aerospace, looking for patterns that can help
us discover and fix problems before they result in TBCs  (truly bad
consequences.)<a name="1419qlink1">  a for instance would be the ill fated shuttle mission.  had
the data miners discovered the link between increased solid rocket motor
burnthru and low temperatures, well, we would have 7 more astronauts
with us today.</a>

<p>
so, i want to learn things about our group without causing anyone to
reveal anything about themselves.  i dont know if it is possible,  may not
be.  {8-[  but i also know there are some clever folks out there who
may know a trick.  how does one poll a group while simultaneously
protecting everyone's privacy and protecting the database from folks
like the lesbian extropian meme starter?  spike
