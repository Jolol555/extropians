According to the doomsdayer, you are a sample not from a current 
snapshot of the human race, but rather from the set of all humans (or 
observers) that will ever have existed (setting to one side John 
Leslie's view on the relevance of indeterminism). It seems wrong to 
assume that the the sampling picture works only spatially but not 
temporally. Ignorance about you spatial position is on a par with 
ignorance about your temporal position. (Recall Leslie's analogy 
about the emeralds.)

<p>
That would be the wrong analogy. Since you are supposed to be a 
random sample from all observers that will ever have existed, we have 
to pick the ball from an urn containing all balls that it will ever 
contain in order to mirror the real situation truthfully

<p>

<p>
No, it rather seems to be similar to the objections he replies to on 
pp. 214 ff.

<i>&gt; Estimates of human population growth show an exponential growth</i><br>

<i>&gt; the "urn of 10" situation when, in fact, we had an urn with 10 that</i><br>
<i>&gt; would experience a vast increase in its contents in the future.</i><br>

<p>
It is true that cavemen would have been misled if they had applied 
the doomsday argument. As with every probabilistic argument, it 
doesn't guarantee that you get the right answer; if you are 
unlucky and happen to be placed in an unusual situation, then you 
your guess will be wrong.

<p>
But try this: Imagine that everybody that will ever have lived 
applies the doomsday argument and make guesses accordingly. Compare 
what fraction will turn out to have been right in this case with what 
happens if they reject the doomsday argument. You'll find that 
reasoning in accordance with the doomsday argument maximizes the 
fraction that will be right.
