<p>
No, I was just echoing the wording of your question, as is clear from
the material above.  I am happy to say that that body has died, but that
the person is still alive.  Likewise, if I find a severed finger, I will
say that the finger is dead, but that the person it was associated with
may still be alive.  The finger used to be alive, but now it is dead.

<p>
<a href="0731.html#0755qlink2">&gt; Someone asked what the dead</a><br>
<i>&gt; body was if the person didn't die.  You said there was no dead body.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0770qlink1">I did not engage in any such discussion.</a>

<p>
<a href="0731.html#0755qlink3">&gt; You still refuse to use the word "dead".  Please define your test of</a><br>
<i>&gt; whether a person is dead or alive.  Current medical tests would fail to</i><br>
<i>&gt; find your person alive.  Current medical tests would declare your person</i><br>
<i>&gt; dead.  Until you can give a new definition for a new use of these terms,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is difficult to follow your explanations.</i><br>

<p>
I think you are using the terms "person" and "body" synonymously here.
Once we consider people who have no bodies, this correspondence is no
longer so clear.

<p>
<a name="0770qlink2">You might also consider what would happen if you do an autopsy and when
you open the skull you find only a radio transceiver, with transducers
interfacing to all the nerves which come into the brain.  The body was
being tele-operated by a brain (or computer?) elsewhere.</a>  There is an
amusing story based on this concept in the Hofstadter/Dennett collection
"The Mind's I", an excellent book for those interested in these kinds of
issues.

<p>
<a name="0770qlink3">Let me add one other point.  In my opinion, the "alive vs dead" distinction
is not the central point.  The central issue is consciousness, whether it
is terminated or (potentially) continues.</a>

<p>
Being "alive" generally applies to biological systems with various
properties of reproduction, maintainance of structure, etc.  There are
many living systems which appear to have no consciousness, such as
bacteria.

<p>
<a name="0770qlink4">It should also become possible to create conscious systems which are not
"alive" by most definitions.  If I load an AI program into my computer so
that it can think, reason, feel, etc., it still would not have most of the
properties generally associated with life.  It would be conscious but not
"alive".</a>

<p>
This distinction is seen in the fields of Artificial Intelligence
versus Artificial Life.  The latter studies simulated organisms which
can reproduce and grow in various ways, but which are not necessarily
intelligent or conscious at all.  AI on the other hand cares very little
for the attributes studied by ALife researchers.

<p>
Now, you might choose to arbitrarily say that an AI system is "alive", even
though it does not fall into the normal definitions.  I prefer to say that
just as we can have living systems which are not conscious, we could have
conscious systems which are not living.  There is no inherent association
between the two concepts.

<p>
Given this perspective, we should recognize that the important factor with
regard to a person is whether his consciousness is not destroyed, not
whether he is biologically dead.  Someone may be dead, but as long as there
is the possibility or actuality that his consciousness goes on, he should
not fear death.

<p>
<a name="0770qlink5">Consciousness, in my view, is an information-processing activity.  A given
instance of consciousness is defined by its state and its transitions as
it processes information.</a>  As long as this information which defines the
<a name="0770qlink6">consciousness is preserved, it has the potential of continuing.  Rather
than trying to stay alive, we should try to preserve our consciousness,
in this sense.</a>

<p>
<a name="0770qlink7">So seeing a dead body does not by itself give you enough information
to judge whether the information which defines the consciousness, the
"person", it embodied, has been lost.  Rather than focusing on death vs
life, the issue is better dealt with in informational terms, in my
opinion.
