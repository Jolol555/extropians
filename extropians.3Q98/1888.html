When talking to christians, I generally ask then if they would
support my petition to abolish ritual symbolic cannabalism.
Most of them agree to support my petition after I explain that
that it's a major problem in this country and its practitoners
gather to perform their horrible rituals throughout the
country, inducting even their own children into the practice.
Generally, I can continue to explain the practice for several
minutes before they catch on. Usually, I have to mention that
their diety initiated the practice via a quasi-human avatar,
saying "this is my body eat it of me.."
