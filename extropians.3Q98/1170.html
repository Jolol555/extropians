<a name="1186qlink1"><a href="1154.html#1170qlink1">&gt;&gt; Gary Hudson is a pretty smart guy; if he says he can do it, I think he has</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a good chance of doing it.</i><br>

<p>
I also hate to be techno-pesimistic, but this is *rockets* you are talking
about.  So, I'd like to point out that Gary Hudson has been involved in
many, many rocket projects, all failures.  I applaud his determination.  In
my opinion, he is a brilliant salesman, and can attract funding to any
rocket project at all.  Since his job in this curent endevour is not a
technical one, I am sure he is an asset to the project.  In my opinion, all
of his technical ideas of the past were doomed due to a lack of respect for
simplicity, and I am not speaking out of hindsight.  For that matter, most
space launch projects suffer the same problem.
