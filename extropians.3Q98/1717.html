Sean, get a grip.  I only have a cursory interest in the group, and could
probably be considered to be on the outer edge of the outer circle. 
However, I've experienced the same problems as others when
searching for emails on the site and have eventually needed to resort to
performing the search manually by downloading almost everything ever
posted for a particular year; and I did eventually find what I was looking
for.

<p>
All in all, the conspiracy theory seems a bit much.

Yet another attempt to shroud the truth with cover-up tactics.  I did not 
initially realize how widespread this censorship conspiracy had become,
I had  hoped it was limited to a few insiders -- Max's inner circle. 
However the  swiftness with which a handful of individuals came to
Max's defense has  convinced me otherwise.  If they aren't in on it
themselves, they are clearly  under the delusion that Max and his ilk can
do no wrong.  I think everyone  needs to take a long hard look at the
evidence and not make premature  judgements -- there may be forces
acting in opposition to the common good, as  there generally are.
