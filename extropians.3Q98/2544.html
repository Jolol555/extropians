<p>
 So many people? I doubt that there are more than a half-dozen people
who meet Eliezer's criteria, and it's quite possible that none of them
are aware of informed disagreement with their arguments.
 If he thinks more than a handfull of people meet his criteria, then he's
probably overlooking a fair number of them who don't believe in any kind
of singularity.
<br>
 I'm sure that Drexler would be interested in debating this in the proper
forum, although it might be hard to find a forum he would accept.

<p>
 If he understood your request, I'm sure he would do something other than
just tell us what his analysis doesn't consist of.
