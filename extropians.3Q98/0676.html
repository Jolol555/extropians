You're using the word "egoism" in a very simplistic manner here.
In the real world, the payoff function is a very complex relationship,
that includes most of the people that you know and even many that you
don't (in most cases indistinguishable from a utilitarian one).
On the other hand, if you're a Utilitarian, you're forcing someone
else's payoff function on me. It's a nice offer, but I think I'll pass.</a>
