But the FAQ didn't cover the possibility of that quark-like thingy vibrating
backwards and forwards across time which would be quite a natural addition to our
physical laws if it were ever accepted. As a counterpoint it conjures up a good
explanation in my mind that because I mobilized on the probability of winning my
war against capitalism, histories were set in motion which gave my country, New
Zealand, one of the most dictatorial right wing (fascist) governments in the world
today.

"I would say it is not until you have four or five such clearances, that THE NEXT
LEVEL is revealed to you. Then you become aware that THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THIS;
that these clearances can be generated very quickly in a day or two; and such
types of information CAN BE SEGREGATED -- I am not saying only from the public or
Congress, BUT EVEN FROM OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE TWO OR THREE OTHER CLEARANCES --
very effectively." [Emphasis added   AB] p.508

<a href="2128.html#2137qlink4">&gt; Anyway, if I follow you correctly, Ingrid is an attempt to automate and</a><br>
<i>&gt; coordinate the distribution of personal construct grids, yes?  In doing so,</i><br>
<i>&gt; a simply written program could coordinate the whole of human behavior if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; had access to enough/ the right grids.  Am I on the right track?</i><br>

<p>
Ingrid is capable of extracting meaning from not only personal constructs but from
such a vast spectrum of subjective and objective data that next to it the price
system would seem tiny. Could a price system run a muscle or artificial vision or
a global government? I bet Ingrid can handle all this and what's more all the
interpretation is similar. Take SPSS for example, locked up as it is with
capitalistic restrictions, at its top end it can verify what Ingrid does but I
know how easy it would be for me to get Ingrid gently blended into the background
of every computer on the planet, by first getting it used in government; - not as
an aid to conduct studies but as a way to link all studies and then fold in
democracy then capitalism.

<p>
Ah, if only it weren't for that quark thingy making things tough for me, I'd be at
the ending of the age of hypothesis, instead of being consigned to the sideshows
of history.

<i>&gt;</i><br>

Thanks, I get a new link and enter a diary note to pass on the Caesar, Lincoln,
Kennedy currency coincidences when they resurface.
