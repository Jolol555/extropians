<i>&gt;hypothesis that RH is living in such-and-such a place and time.</i><br>

<p>
It's not at all simple for me.</a>  I could sortof accept the idea that I
<a name="1837qlink2">might have been someone else instead.  But I find it very hard to believe
that you could make Robin hanson forget not so much that he was no longer
Robin Hanson, *and* enough so he couldn't tell he wasn't a Martian living on
Hermes in 2200.</a>  And even if you could I don't see the relevance of that poor
hypothetical creature and what I should infer from what I know.  If you're
going to rest the DA on this construction, it seems implausible from the
get go.

<i>&gt;admit that only observers can enter the reference class while still</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1837qlink3">I'm not sure the SIA is sufficient to deal with all the cases of
interest.  I'd rather instead accept an approach to defining states
and priors.
