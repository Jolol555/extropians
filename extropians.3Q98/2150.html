A diagnosis is way different from a cure. If I see a fireman using water
to put out a dangerous fire, one in which water is likely to cause further
problems, I don't offer to pass the bucket as that would only make matters
worse.

Can't any of you who are being demeaning toward my proposition find it
reasonable to understand that I'm talking about replacing existing
'values' with electronically mediated 'meanings'. It's one thing to talk
about the meaning of values but to me it seems superfluous to talk about
the value of meaning. All your economic arguments of exchange and wealth
can be solved in the context of associated meanings which is what the
Ingrid software handles superbly. Ask any statistician. Really!
