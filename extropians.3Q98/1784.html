<p>
Nice idea, although I don't believe in it. It seems that the
distinction between topological long-term changes and short term
activities is rather blurred; most likely there are processes on all
scales, making the short-term effects (calcium levels, dynamical
synapses etc) necessary for longer-term effects (LTP, synaptic
movements) and permanent storage. So the thought processes would have
trouble with their long-term memory: each would suffer a kind of
encoding impairment that would likely be rather distressing.

<p>
<a href="1727.html#1784qlink2">&gt;     Of course, it could still leads to serious troubles: how do you</a><br>
<i>&gt; share important new informations? How do you change</a> the configuration</i><br>
<a name="1800qlink3"><i>&gt; of the neural net (I guess sleep is a key)?</i><br>

<p>
Sleep is likely the key of long-term memory consolidation, but
obviously we learn during the day before going to sleep too. Maybe, if
we are lucky (but don't count on it, this is something I'm almost
certain doesn't work) you would only need to deal with the medial
temporal lobe memory system. Then each process will have its own copy
of the MTL and during sleep the exoself could run consolidation
between the MTL of process 1 and the shared cortex, then consolidation
for process 2, and so on. But don't count on it, most likely low-level
learning is going on across the cortex as a part of normal thinking.</a>

<p>
<a name="1800qlink4"><i>&gt; What do you do with your body, because you still have only one?</i><br>

<p>
Why only one? If you can do this with the neural nets, making extra
bodies should be fairly simple (for those who want bodies. I would
like to exist partially as processes on the net)</a>

<p>
<a name="1800qlink5"><a href="1727.html#1784qlink3">&gt;Can a neural net layer function</a><br>
<i>&gt; normally without a body?</i><br>

<p>
Can a human function normally without a body? Most likely no, although
the definition of normal may change. We are input-output driven, and
without inputs we tend to fall asleep or get sensory deprivation
problems, and without body feedback emotions become blunted. Most
likely even completely virtual people will need simulated bodies, at
least until they can be modified enough to handle new senses and forms
of action.</a>
