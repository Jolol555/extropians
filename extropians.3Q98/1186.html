Another failing of Hudson (which is not bad) is an inability to appreciate the
conservative narrow mindedness of most investors. Yes, many of his projects have
been excessively complex, however the main reason why he has always had trouble
raising sufficient capital is because his ideas are always not part of mainstream
aerospace/aerodynamic design conventions, sometimes so far out that people think
he's crazy. His Pheonix project was actually rather simple, and would have worked
if he was able to get sufficient funding. His funding problem was caused more by
the expected bureaucratic expenses adn delays being seen as a major impediment.
