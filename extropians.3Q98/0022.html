	Look, "they"  are far more than childishly "pissed".
	What "they" are is - untrained, uneducated, unskilled and illiterate - we are
</pre>
talking seriously unempowered, unfed, molested, ill-clothed, peer-pressured
into gangs (don't even get me started on that) and 99% possiblity of drug use
and arrests by about fifteen.

<p>
	Unprepared - by the Darwinistic environement they sum up from - to do much
good for themselves.  

<p>
	Many choose crime OVER welfare, not because "they" were rejected by it - more
likely because 1) they are suicidial or 2)  they have too much indiginous
pride to eat out of the gov'ts piggy "trough".</a>

<p>
	If one has the balls to stop badmouthing people and making sweeping
generalizationst  and go in and try to actively reform an individual who was
raised thusly, (excluding the ones who are too brain damaged from crackparents
or mal-nourishement) one usually finds - not your imaginary  spoiled child,
blissfully living off the tit of the welfare system, but a *grief* stricken
young man, living in a war-zone, most of his friends dead or insitutionalized,
beat to shit by the teachers, the cops and hearing that demeaning crap from
people like you - pardon me for saying it.

<p>
He is left bereft of his most precious assest, his self esteem and the
knowledge that he has anything to contribute.

<p>
Yet he still has willingness and hope that he will find a job, a family and a
life.
<br>
Yet he still has energy to learn new skills, to make art and have ideas.
Yet he still wants what many of us do: respect, money, and power....
