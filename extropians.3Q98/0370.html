If you can access the Washington Post online, there is an excellent 
article in today's Style section on the Bengali poet Taslima Nasrin, 
who is presently under _fatwa_ (an offer of large monetary reward to 
whoever can find her and put her to death).  The charge--blasphemy.  
The cause--her poetry promotes feminist and secular ideas and has 
become a sensation among young women in Bangladesh.  She has taken a 
stand against religion, fanaticism, and oppression of females.

<p>
After escaping to Sweden for a while, she traveled through Europe 
(heavily guarded) and presently is in New York for a few 
months to see if she could live here.  

<p>
I found her story a good reminder of just how revolutionary some of our 
most basic ideas are in some parts of the world.
