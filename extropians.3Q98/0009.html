I think that the ageism of our culture is going to seem pretty ridiculous from
the perspective of a couple of hundreed years.  Discrimination against the
elderly is not a transhuman activity as I understand it.

<a name="0011qlink1">I think that Anders is right that things like face lifts and hair dyes are
unlikely to interfere with rejuvinating technology, when it arrives.  That is
because they are superficial changes.  Viagra and anti-balding drugs are not
superficial changes, and the the life extension effect of viagra is probably
fundamentally negative.</a>  Our obsession with youth culture is interfering with
the transhuman objectives.

<p>
<a name="0011qlink2">As for the transhuman persona, I feel that it is important to act as a
transhuman, not falsely appear as one.  Cosmetic surgury can mask the effects
of aging, so I avoid it.  Life extension is a fundamental change.</a>
