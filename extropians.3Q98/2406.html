Abstract
<br>
  The oldest man in Japan
<br>
  reached the age of 112 years in October 1996. As an Okinawan centenarians, he
  had been followed closely for the previous 12 years. One sister, 8 years
  younger, was alive at the start of the study; all other family members were
  killed in the Okinawan War, 1945. The man did agricultural
  work until age 85, after which he continued to be physically active and to
  pay close attention to his health. Results of medical examinations, including
  blood tests, remained within the normal limits, with a few exceptions. Some
  abnormalities were found on the electrocardiogram; the red blood cell count
  and the hemoglobin and hematocrit values decreased relatively slowly. His
  intake of nutrients was relatively well-balanced, and at the age of 100 his
  intake energy was 1361 kilocalories per day, which is close to the value
  recommended for centenarians. His personality was categorized as "Type A",
  but the pattern was typical of that seen in other Okinawan centenarians. He
  was able to perform almost activities of daily living until the age of 108.
  At that time he was admitted to the hospital and his ability to perform those
  activities decreased sharply. His scores on the revised version of the
  Hasegawa dementia scale was within the normal range when he was 106 years
  old, but 3 years later it was in the "dementia" range. The rapidity of the
  decreases in his mental status and in his ability to perform activities of
  daily living that occurred when he was admitted to the hospital indicate
  that, if circumstances permit, elderly men may benefit from living at home
  with their families. Close attention to diet and exercise from youth through
  senescence may also contribute to health and longevity.
