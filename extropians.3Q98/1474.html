        Max: it is pretty much futile trying to rationalize with imbeciles
like this.  The world is certainly full of the same type --people who lack
foresight and the ability to examine the reasons for their actions.  What
makes it frustrating is when they try to permeate a list such as this with
their atittudes bloated by a faux-superiority complex, thinking they know
ever so much more than those around them.  Fortunately, they eventually
realize --much to late-- that the superiority that they held so dear was in
fact faux, and they find themselves pinned underneath the weight of a
reality which they could never quite escape.

<p>
        Colin: if there is any shred of tact or decency within your
burdened mind, you will wisely listen to what is said by those who have
more experience than yourself...even if you disagree.  An apology to Max
*is* in order...be it on the list or not.  If you *do* have any tact or
decency, you will understand the necessity of this simple act, but if, as I
suspect, you don't, you will doubtlessly amble on towards the chosen fate I
mentioned above.
