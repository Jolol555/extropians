What is the big deal? You know the two most common places for people to
find partners are work and church (at least in America), since both work
and church are for me tied very closely to the internet...why not? I
mean to say that my lifestyle has incorperated cyberness so much that I
find it harder and harder to relate to people who are not immersed in
technology. So if I hop onto my computer and engage people
intellectually and creatively and then find some of them attractive, I
mean what's the big deal about expressing intrest in them personally? I
mean I work at home, I don't go to church, and I try to avoid alcohol so
bar 'babes' are not gonna do it for me. When I DJ I'm normally busy
working and everyone else is 'hooking up.'

I don't think i'm that unique. Extropian endeavors are at this point
highly singular efforts. The nature of the electronic music I make, for
example, makes collaberations difficult (although I've been exchanging
<br>
.aiff files over the net for remixing), a lot of long hours are spent in<br>
my electronic music studio experimenting with the nature of sound. I
think that a lot of Extropians are researchers, programmers, artists,
and that we probably don't have a huge amount of time for all of the
normal rituals that lead up to getting laid (or whatever) So as a sort
of consolation prize, I interact with people on the internet. I find it
to be pretty satisfying. If some are cute (like Sarah Marr) I'm gonna
bust a move.  Who's it gonna hurt? If anyone is not interested they
should just say so. I think there's some pretty intellegent and
sensitive persons in this group, I think if you make your desires clear
they will be respected.

<p>
That's all I'm ever saying about this subject forever!
