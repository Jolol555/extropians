<a href="1554.html#1572qlink1">&gt; Nick, I wanted to reiterate my request since I think</a><br>
<i>&gt; it might have gotten lost in the thread. The problem I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have with the DA is that it appears to me that any</i><br>
<i>&gt; member of any species that applies the DA to its situation</i><br>
<i>&gt; will always conclude that their species faces extinction</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the near term.</i><br>

<p>
You only get the near-term doom prediction if yo think population has 
been or will be increasing. With a constant population size, you 
should expect, other things equal, that the species will last about 
as long as it has already done.


<p>
<i>&gt;If Bayes' theorem is telling us only</i><br>
<a href="1554.html#1572qlink2">&gt; 99.999% of the species that analyze the DA should conclude</a><br>
<i>&gt; imminent doom</i><br>

<p>
If the DA is correct, everybody should apply it.

<p>
<a href="1554.html#1572qlink3">&gt; but in practice 100% are then I begin to</a><br>
<i>&gt; wonder if we are overlooking something, we're screwing</i><br>
<i>&gt; something up in the application of Bayes' theorem, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; drawing wrong conclusions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With that in mind, can you describe an individual that</i><br>
<i>&gt; could apply to DA to its situation and not conclude</i><br>
<i>&gt; doom was imminent?</i><br>

<p>
For example, an individual who thought population were constant. Or 
an individual who had strong empirical grounds for not thinking doom 
imminent.

<p>
<i>&gt; What can we say about that individual?</i><br>
<a href="1554.html#1572qlink4">&gt; The items I would like to know are:</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What would such an individual know(i.e., about its species,</i><br>
<i>&gt; its relative position, etc.)?</i><br>

<p>
If she knew both her relative position and past and future population 
figures, then she could deduce exactly when doom would happen. 
So presumably she won't know her relative position.

<p>
<a href="1554.html#1572qlink5">&gt; What is that individual's situation that would lead it to</a><br>
<i>&gt; conclude doom was not imminent?</i><br>

<p>
It has to do with that person's belifs about population figures and 
empirical risks. 

<p>
<a href="1554.html#1572qlink6">&gt; Could another individual sitting next to this individual</a><br>
<i>&gt; reach a different conclusion?</i><br>

<p>
Yes, if he had different information or different priors.

<p>
<a href="1554.html#1572qlink7">&gt; Could another individual of the same species at an earlier</a><br>
<i>&gt; or later point in time apply the DA and reach a different</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusion?</i><br>

<p>
Yes.

<p>
<a href="1554.html#1572qlink8">&gt; (The answer would seem to be "yes" unless there</a><br>
<i>&gt; was some reason to believe the species' existence was</i><br>
<i>&gt; indefinite.) If the answer is "yes", what qualitative or</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantitative differences would there be between the knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the individual in question and the ancestor/descendant?</i><br>

<p>
For example, a stoneage man might have thought there was some 
probability that the species might become extinct before 1000 AC. You 
are certain that that didn't happen.
