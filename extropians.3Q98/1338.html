There would seem to be an evolutionary justification; if women are 
responsible for bringing up children then they're likely to prefer a 
secure, stable society because that's likely to improve the chances of 
their children surviving. Given that the kinds of futures we talk about 
are far from secure and stable it's no surprise that women who haven't
transcended their evolutionary programming are going to feel horrified.

The "hot babe" I'm currently going out with is certainly open to transhuman
ideas. Interestingly she's also in no hurry to have kids (if she ever does),
so this would fit with the theory above.
