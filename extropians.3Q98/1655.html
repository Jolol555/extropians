Boog:

<p>
Did you read either my post or (more importantly) David McFadzean's post on
this topic yesterday? Not only were Erik's post's missing from the archive,
but at least *9 months* worth of posts were missing. You did an author 
search (and so did I). Did you look at the dates? Apparently,</a> everything
after March of '97 was missing from that year, due to some problem with
the software. This problem is apparently still not fixed. When it is, the posts
that were missing (*9 months worth*) should be back. 

<p>
Your author searches and keyword searches confirm that posts were missing. But
in no way do they confirm that *only certain posts by certain authors* were
missing. As I said, *I* couldn't find posts by other authors. Specifically,
I was searching for Kennita Watson and Will Wiser so I could find their
email addresses. Did someone have a reason to censor them? Or to delete 9 
months worth of posts?

<p>
*Please* consider the other evidence available to you here. Others will confirm
that there were problems with the archives. Ask around. The problems have been
talked about before. If you try to be just a little more rigorous and 
scientific about this, I'm certain you'll find there are MUCH better 
explanations for what has occured than censorship.

<p>
Thanks for your consideration,
