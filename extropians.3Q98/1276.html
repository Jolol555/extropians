<br>
President          Extropy Institute (ExI)

<p>
     Extropy = the extent of a system's intelligence, information, vitality,
diversity,
<br>
     opportunity, and capacity for growth.


<p>
E X T R O P Y  I N S T I T U T E

<p>
Extropy Institute (ExI) is a 501[c][3] tax-exempt educational corporation,
founded in 1992 as an outgrowth of the Extropy journal. ExI acts a catalyst
for
<br>
a better future by helping individuals extend their lives, augment their
intelligence, optimize their psychology, and improve their communities. The
Institute pursues this catalytic role in two ways: through a creative process
of networking and an educational process of disseminating ideas.

<p>
In its creative role, the Institute brings together the finest critical and
innovative minds in an intellectual and social network. This network of
thinkers challenges conventional ideas about human limits and develops new
ideas about the use of technologies of all kinds to improve the future.
Seeking
<br>
to develop careful thinking about extending the human life span, augmenting
human intelligence, improving human psychology, and refining economic and
political organization, Extropy Institute provides several forums for
networking and creative thinking. The Exponent newsletter gathers news of
developments, members' projects, and Institute activities. The EXTRO
conferences bring together thinkers from numerous fields of study. Other
seminars and local meetings, the Extropians email list, and the web site
provide additional forums for developing and refining ideas.

<p>
In its educational role, the Institute brings these (always open and evolving)
extropian ideas to the public in order to encourage more rational practices
and
<br>
beliefs. The Institute's web site provides information on extropian thinking
and links to further resources. Extropy Online presents extropian thinking
gathered from the best minds in a manner accessible to intelligent
non-specialists. The EXTRO conferences, in addition to their networking role,
also act as a means of communicating current extropian thinking to the public.
The Institute disseminates ideas and educates the public through
appearances of
<br>
its members on television and in newspapers, magazines, and books, and by
representing extropian perspectives at conferences and in debates.

<p>
In essence, the Institute seeks to catalyze continual discoveries that extend
our lives and increase the power and depth of our minds. While Institute
members may hold diverse and sometimes conflicting ideas about how to pursue
these ends, we agree in affirming the values expressed in the Extropian
Principles: Boundless Improvement, Self-Transformation, Self-Ownership,
Dynamic
<br>
Optimism, Intelligent Technology, and Spontaneous Order. [see
www.extropy.org/extprn26.htm]

<br>
ExI is creating a network of specialized email forums (NodeNet). These each
focus on a particular topic, such as life extension research, neural-computer
interfaces, future forecasting, investing in the future, data security, mind
uploading, personality alteration, economic effects of technology, creativity
and the arts, truth machines and privacy, data security, and others. Extropy
Institute members can subscribe to these forums free of charge. The NodeNet
forums are organized so as to maximize useful discussion, information, and
analysis. The unique perspective and expertise of the forums makes them a
major
<br>
benefit of ExI membership. You can find information on current forums on the
web site at www.extropy.org/nodenet.htm.

<p>
Moving to the web in its tenth year, Extropy is a magazine covering the full
range of advanced, emerging, and future technologies with an emphasis on how
the individual and society can and will adapt and profit from these
developments.

<p>
Since 1988, Extropy magazine has provided a forum for thinking and discussion
about the advancing wave of scientific and technological progress and its
impact on humanity. Extropy's interests are multi-disciplinary and
cross-disciplinary. As fascinated as we are with the technologies driving
change, we are essentially concerned with the relationship between
technological advance and philosophical, creative, cultural, psychological,
economic, interpersonal and political ideas and institutions. Just some of the
technologies and issues covered in Extropy Online: 


<UL>
  <li>  Advances in computers and human-computer interaction and integration. 
  <li>  Intelligence augmentation through nutrients, new smart drugs, and cognitive
techniques. 
  <li>  Life extension treatments, nutritional supplements, the latest anti-aging
drugs. 
  <li>  Exploration of our conception of "human nature" in a world transformed by
advancing biotechnology. 
  <li>  Applying critical and creative thining to living successfully in times of
rapid and deep technological change. 
  <li>  Refining political and social organizations to adapt and prosper in an
environment of accelerating change. 
  <li>  Rethinking traditional moralities in the face of scientific and
technological


</UL>
<p>
breakthroughs. 
<br>
* Modifying mood and motivation with new drugs and cognitive management. <br>

<UL>
  <li>  Identifying and analyzing poor thinking about the desirability and
applications of radical new technologies. 


</UL>
<p>
If you're tired of shallow, trendy, or uncritical thinking on the
technological
<br>
frontier, Extropy will satisfy, startle, and stimulate you. 

<p>
    "I love it. Extropy excites the hell out of my mind." ZL, 1/93

<p>
    "In general I would call it the best periodical I have ever seen in my
life..." AC, 8/92

<p>
    "I just wanted to let you know that Extropy keeps getting better &amp; better!
(as, of course, it must in order to be so named). What a uniformly excellent,
eclectic, thoughtful, well-written selection of articles. By far the most
thought-provoking, ground-breaking stuff in any magazine I read."  [PG, 7/94]
