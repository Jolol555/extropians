Abstract
<br>
  The effects of chitosan have been investigated on eighty
  patients with renal failure undergoing long-term stable haemodialysis
  treatment. The patients were tested after a control treatment period of 1
  week. Half were fed 30 chitosan tablets (45 mg
  chitosan/tablet) three times a day. Ingestion of
  chitosan effectively reduced total serum cholesterol levels
  (from 10.14 +/- 4.40 to 5.82 +/- 2.19 mM) and increased serum haemoglobin
  levels (from 58.2 +/- 12.1 to 68 +/- 9.0 g L-1). Significant reductions in
  urea and creatinine levels in serum were observed after 4 weeks of
  chitosan ingestion. The feeling of physical strength, the
  appetite and the sleep of patients in the treatment group had improved
  significantly after 12 weeks of ingestion, compared with those of patients in
  the control group. During the treatment period, no clinically problematic
  symptoms were observed. These data suggest that chitosan
  might be effective treatment for renal failure patients, although the
  mechanism of the effect should be investigated further.
