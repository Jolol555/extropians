This part of my definition does require a lot of caution.  In my case,
however, you have to keep in mind that my last couple of post gave a
precise definition of what I think is me.  I was clumsily assuming
everyone would keep that in mind.  Without a precise definition to
accompany "whatever I think is me" the statement is useless.
