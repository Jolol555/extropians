At first glance they seem to be parodies - especially vhemt - but I got
the distinct impression that they are quite serious. The key for me was
the interview between the leader of the one organization &amp; a
representative
<br>
of the other.

<a name="1453qlink3">Neither group - er, sorry, movement - loves Our Mother the Earth quite
enough to quietly off themselves (this would seem to be the honorable
thing
<br>
to do given their belief set). No, no, they justify their continued
existence (and concommitant destruction of Our Mother the Earth) with 
their purpose of trying to get others to off themselves first (don't
worry, we'll be right behind you, no really we will).
