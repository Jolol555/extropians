Try here. I ripped the following from an ADBUSTER'S website at:

<p>
<a href="http://www.adbusters.org/Articles/voodoo.html">http://www.adbusters.org/Articles/voodoo.html</a>
</a>

<p>
<a name="2119qlink7">But there's a glaring flaw in the expansionist argument. They haven't come up
with an accurate way of measuring the economic growth they keep talking about.
</a>
<a name="2119qlink8">Their chief measure of growth is the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and it is
seriously flawed.
</a>

<p>
Consider:

<p>
<a name="2119qlink9">When the Exxon Valdez spilled its load of oil into the Gulf of Alaska -- a dark
<a name="2119qlink10">moment in recent American history -- America's GDP went up. (A lot of money was
</a>
<a name="2119qlink11">spent on the cleanup, media coverage, ecological testing, legal fees, etc.) When
</a>
</a>
<a name="2119qlink12">the Gulf War broke out, America's GDP went up again. Money changed hands. The
country became “healthier.” Indeed, every time there's a car accident or a newly
</a>
<a name="2119qlink13">diagnosed cancer patient, whenever personal or societal catastrophies occur, the
</a>
<a name="2119qlink14">GDP goes up and the economy.”
</a>

<p>
Consider:

<p>
<a name="2119qlink15">Walking, biking and mass transit contribute less to the GDP than using an
automobile. Trains contribute less than airplanes; an extra blanket or sweater
<a name="2119qlink16">less than raising the thermostat; one-child families less than six-child
families; eating legumes less than eating beef; starting a vegetable garden less
</a>
</a>
<a name="2119qlink17">than buying at the supermarket; staying home to raise your daughter less than
<a name="2119qlink18">getting a part-time job at Wendy's. (Indeed, the GDP fails to assign any value at
</a>
all to unpaid or volunteer work. Work done by tens of millions of North Americans
</a>
<a name="2119qlink19">simply does not show up on the radar. It's as if the work --  and the workers --
</a>
don't exist.)

<p>
<a name="2140qlink1"><a name="2119qlink20">GDP measures the “goods” but not the “bads.” That's why ecological economists
have developed their own measures of economic welfare. The three graphs on this
</a>
<a name="2119qlink21">page show the GDPs of the US, UK and Germany all heading merrily upward from 1955
</a>
<a name="2119qlink22">through the 1980s. However, a more accurate measure of economic progress, the
ISEW (Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare) developed by Herman Daly and John
</a>
<a name="2119qlink23">Cobb in 1990, tells a very different story. When some of the “bads,” such as
pollution, depletion of non-renewable resources and car exhaust-related health
</a>
<a name="2119qlink24">costs are factored in, a radically different picture of the economy emerges. The
</a>
<a name="2119qlink25">US, German and UK economies all show no improvement in economic welfare since the
</a>
<a name="2119qlink26">1970s. In fact, economic welfare levels off and starts falling dramatically in
</a>
</a>
each country.

<p>
The ISEW (and other economic progress indicators developed since) expose the
expansionists as a bunch of eager beavers without a well-considered business plan
--  pseudo scientists urging the world ahead before they themselves have clear
bearings. Neoclassical economists cling to their mathematical models like
children clinging to their teddy bears. They operate in a kind of academic
isolation that does not acknowledge the effects of their policies on real people.
They see data, not lives. Their world is the world of “revealed preferences” and
“rational expectations,” of “perfectly voluntary exchange” and “negative
externalities” that can be dismissed. Their world is not our world. Their world
does not exist.

<p>
“The difference between science and economics,” says F.E. Banks in Truth and
Economics, “is that science aims at an understanding of the behaviour of nature,
while economics is involved with an understanding of models -- and many of these
models have no relation to any state of nature that has ever existed on this
planet, or any that is likely to exist between now and doomsday. The word that
comes to mind when confronted by these fantasies is fraud.”
