I would love to see these "optimistic" adjectives put up into a noun/doing grid
and displayed on my Ingrid site, but I haven't got time right now. Can anyone
help?

May I? When I wrote my 'Synoptic Anatomy of Ekhumanity" which defined the many
stages for the evolution of homo sapiens into homo divinus, the greek term
"autonomous" was part of the definition of human nature, however because of our
'plant like' future this term became problematic in terms of legal guarantees
against being unwittingly uprooted, as it were.

<p>
Should you allow my term "neuronomy" to include those behaviors that use a
spontaneous will and a conscience derived from at least an associative net that
sums things in a non-linear way in order to bootstrap decentralized resource
allocation systems of all kinds, I'd be happy to call that a market. Bootstrap may
not be the right word here, but I hope you get my drift(:-)
