<i>&gt;        &gt;This seems to me to be a very common mistake. :)  The music</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;*isn't* the "same"; it is only very similar.  That is, they are</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0312.html#0318qlink2">&gt;        &gt;not really one piece of music, but two, that happen to differ</a><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;only in location.  They do differ, though.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is completely wrong, that is say that the E mail message you sent</i><br>
me  
<br>
<a href="0312.html#0318qlink3">&gt;contained erroneous ideas, I have no way of knowing if the original</a><br>
message  
<br>
<a href="0312.html#0318qlink4">&gt;you typed on your computer was right or wrong because I never saw it,</a><br>
all I 
<br>
<a href="0312.html#0318qlink5">&gt;saw was a copy and that's just not the same thing.</a><br>

<p>
Since you assume that the copy of the
<br>
email that you have is an exact copy, 
<br>
you may assume that it is exactly 
<br>
similar to my copy of the original email. :)

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0312.html#0318qlink6">&gt;        &gt;I will agree with this.  There is no way to tell the </a><br>
<i>&gt;difference, </i><br>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt;If there is no way to tell the difference then what makes you think</i><br>
there is 
<br>
<i>&gt;a difference?</i><br>

<p>
If the upload (or copying) is done in a way that
*could* have left the original undestroyed, then
the upload is a copy.  That is to say, I would 
agree that an upload done cell by cell, over a
conscious period of time, is the same individual
after the upload.  But if it is conducted in such a
way that there could be *two* people who are
exactly similar, *at least* one of them is not the
original.  Given this, a scan made of my brain
and then uploaded is a *version* of me, but is
not me in the same way that the person who
will be having my dinner later is me.

<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Of course, if the CDs themselves are expected to be aware, then</i><br>
<pre>
the         
<br>
<a href="0292.html#0318qlink7">&gt;        &gt;first CD will never know it is "offline", any more than other</a><br>
dead         
<br>
<a href="0312.html#0318qlink8">&gt;        &gt;people know that they are dead.</a><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt;For some reason in these thought experiments people always identify with</i><br>
the 
<br>
<a href="0312.html#0318qlink9">&gt;"original", just for fun imagine what it's like to be the "copy". You</a><br>
may  
<br>
<a href="0312.html#0318qlink10">&gt;have been created only 5 minutes age but it doesn't matter because you</a><br>
have 
<br>
<a href="0312.html#0318qlink11">&gt;the memories of Randall R Randall, you remember being the Randall R </a><br>
<i>&gt;Randall of yesterday </i><br>

<p>
Agreed so far.

<p>
<a href="0312.html#0318qlink12">&gt;so the Randall R Randall of yesterday is not dead. Death </a><br>
<i>&gt;means having a last thought and Randall R Randall hasn't had one of</i><br>
those 
<br>
<i>&gt;yet.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0326qlink1">This is what I disagree with.  *This* R^3 *may have*
had a last thought.  This reminds me of my geometry
classes in the eighties.  If you have a triangle on the
paper in front of you, you can create a triangle with
all of the same measurements, as exactly as you'd 
like.  This triangle is *similar* to the original, but since
we can see the original beside it, it is clear that they
are not the same triangle.  They differ only in location,
but they do differ.</a>

<p>
<a name="0326qlink2">BTW, what if it becomes possible to copy all
of a person's memories and insert them in 
other people?  Does this mean that the person
who created the memories is effectively 
immortal?  Can he shoot himself without dying?</a>

<p>
<a name="0326qlink3"><a href="0312.html#0318qlink13">&gt;I probably haven't convinced you but I'll bet I could have if only you'd</a><br>
seen 
<br>
<a href="0312.html#0318qlink14">&gt;my original message, it was great and would have really knocked your </a><br>
<i>&gt;socks off but unfortunately you'll just have to settle for a copy.</i><br>

<p>
Aw, shucks.  :)
<br>
BTW, this is an excellent reason (IMO, of course)
to disapprove of "intellectual property", which I do,
for the same reasons that I want *this* copy of me
to survive.</a>
