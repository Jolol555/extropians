 I just had friends return from both Belize and Trinidad/Tobaggo
with the same interesting story, apparently they both have a
thriving black market for.......Viagra.

<a name="1920qlink1"> In fact in talking with one of the local injectionist's, my
friends said he remarked that a number of local flora and fauna
were increasing now that they were no longer being used in
traditional aphrodisiacs.</a>

<p>
Maybe this idea could be expanded in asia (there's already a
thriving Hawaii/Japan connection) to help protect endangered
species like Tigers and the black Rhino.

<p>
Extropian connection? Science and technology over
myth/superstition.

  <li>  Injectionists refers to a type of local medicine man, copying
western medical personnel they mix various compounds or simply
inject locals with whatever they have available. In Africa they may
have been responsible for starting local epidemics of everything
including ebola, due to needle sharing.
