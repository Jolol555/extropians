 Few advocates of spontaneous order would expect a system made up of
stupid components to act as intelligently as one made of smart components.
The issue is distributed intelligence versus centralized intelligence.
The centralized version looks at first glance like it makes more use of
intelligence because the role of that intelligence is easier to observe,
but the distributed version can usually make good use of a larger number
of separate intelligences.

 Even if copyright were unenforceable, there are plenty of other large,
centralized organisations that would still exist.
