Something kept me from posting my thoughts and feelings on The Truman Show
for a good while.  I don't really know why, but I didn't like how it kept
coming out on the screen.

<p>
Then, this weekend, I saw the film again, and was inspired to buy the score
at the nearby Virgin Music Megalopolis.  

<p>
And now I realize something.  (Forgive my clever inarticulation of the
following.)  The music from the movie _feels_ Extropian to me.  Spontaneous
<a name="0031qlink1">Order and such... what's a better example than music improvisation</a> round the
clock?

<p>
<a name="0031qlink2">A note about the score... it's by Burkhard Dallwitz, with multiple</a> tracks by
<a name="0031qlink3">Philip Glass.   In fact, two of my favorite bits are originally from Anima
Mundi, a very well-produced (and narrator-free) special on PBS a few years
back.  Philip Glass apparently scored the entire thing.  

<p>
But all I know about him is that he "appeared" briefly on South Park</a> for the
<a name="0031qlink4">Christmas "Mr. Hanky" episode.  Has anyone anything more on this guy?</a>
