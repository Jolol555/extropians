<a href="1879.html#2158qlink1">&gt;&lt;surprise&gt;  In the US, at least,</a><br>
science is usually
<br>
<a href="1879.html#2158qlink2">&gt;funded by taxation directly, far from</a><br>
*paying* taxes...
<br>
<a href="1879.html#2158qlink3">&gt;I would say that this has little to do</a><br>
with the validity
<br>
<a href="1879.html#2158qlink4">&gt;of science, however, any more than it</a><br>
condemns
<br>
<a href="1879.html#2158qlink5">&gt;the concept of building roads.</a><br>

<p>
Right, I forgot about that. Billions of
<br>
tax dollars fund
<br>
political science (particularly
<br>
"politically correct"
<br>
political science). &lt;g&gt;

<p>
No doubt we can agree (okay, this has
<br>
not much to do with
<br>
it) that we can build better roads with
<br>
science than with
<br>
anti-science. Anyway, corporate
<br>
scientific research labs
<br>
(Bell Labs, ADM, Genentech, Lilly
<br>
pharmaceuticals, GE, etc.)
<br>
get most of their funding from real
<br>
profits that they
<br>
generate themselves.

<p>
I brought up the subject of taxes, not
<br>
because of anything
<br>
to do with institutional funding at
<br>
taxpayer expense, but
<br>
because I view science as productive,
<br>
creative, practical,
<br>
truthful, and capable of generating
<br>
taxable wealth (very
<br>
extropian, that). I think that overall,
<br>
science pays more
<br>
taxes than it receives, especially if we
include goods and
<br>
services that scientific research has
<br>
made possible.
<br>
Contrariwise, organized religiosity
<br>
receives more via its
<br>
tax-free status than it has ever had the
means to pay back.

<p>
N.B.: Does the fact that some
<br>
governments deem it worthy of
<br>
funding contribute to the validity of
<br>
science? Well...
<br>
governments that hire religious fanatic
<br>
terrorists instead
<br>
of rocket scientists to provide
<br>
themselves with military
<br>
defense may not think so. Personally, I
<br>
view any paradigm
<br>
(religious, philosophical, aesthetic,
<br>
educational, economic,
<br>
social, whatever) so delelict that it
<br>
requires a special tax
<br>
exemption in order to continue, just a
<br>
waste of time.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2167qlink1"><a href="1879.html#2158qlink6">&gt;&gt;-Science relies on empirical evidence;</a><br>
religion relies on
<br>
faith.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1879.html#2158qlink7">&gt;This one would require some defense, I</a><br>
think.

Have you read Richard Dawkins?
