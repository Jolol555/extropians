No, my theory doesn't claim that.

No, I never argued that.

I don't doubt duplication is possible, that's why I'm discussing it.
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0735qlink5">&gt; as something does not violate the laws of logic or physics it can not</a><br>

I only object on the grounds of physics, not because it's odd.
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0735qlink6">&gt; I can't respond to that because I don't understand it.</a><br>
You seem to be missing most of what I am saying.
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0735qlink7">&gt; You have not explicitly made such a claim but if you're right then the</a><br>
<i>&gt; conclusion is unavoidable, that's one reason I'm so certain you're not right.</i><br>

<p>
Almost none of your comments seem to be in response to my comments.  You
seem to be arguing with a straw-man position that has nothing to do with
my position.  I think that is why this conversation isn't getting
anywhere.
