A while back in a Wired article on wearable
computing ("Dress Code", Issue 6.04, Page 186)
Extropians were described as the "dark side". I
think it may have been mentioned on this list at
the time, did anyone contact the author, Thomas A.
Bass (tbass@hamilton.edu), and get a response?

"Attending the Media Lab event are a handful of
borgs who would love to hop into faster-that-light
space transport and dive straight into the
Clynesian future. They drift around the edge of
the party, wearing Japanese laptops strapped to
their chests and homemade keypads attached to
their wrists. When I try to chat with them, the
conversation keeps slipping into well-worn
grooves. They tell me they are Extropians, like
Hans Moravec and Timothy Leary, who are getting
ready to upload their psyches, jettison our
exhausted planet, and blast off for the
<br>
intergalactic frontier. They combine Buck Rogers
naiveté with a wide streak of paranoia. They are
hungry for prostetics and yearning for time
travel. They shadow the party like doppelgangers,
reminding us that this technology has its dark
side. But no one at the symposium cares to look
under this particular rock or pay them much heed."
