There is no natural place to draw a line between these two, however.
A biological body augmented with nanotech may use materials we don't
normally associate with biology.  There is a continuum between ordinary
biological bodies and things like cyborgs and robots.

<p>
As far as uploading, this does suggest an architecture where the seat
of consciousness is within stationary structures while manipulation is
done via remotes.  However there is nothing inherent in the upload concept
which would prevent some or all of the consciousness moving into the
remote manipulators, and you are again back to the cyborgs/robots.

<p>
The bottom line is that you have matter, energy, and the laws of physics.
Conscious entities will use these to accomplish their goals.  Trying to
categorize their means as biological vs technological is not going to
be useful in the long run.
