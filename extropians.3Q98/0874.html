Yes.

If the sound was louder for one than the other.

Not if you talked to them both at the same time.

Well, I'm sure everything wouldn't have to be identical down to the atomic 
level, our senses are not that acute. In fact our senses, poor as they are,  
still send more information to the brain than it can process, a smart brain 
knows what information it can safely ignore and what it should pay close 
attention to. I don't think anybody really knows just how similar things 
would have to be before divergence happens.

<p>
Anyway it's just a thought experiment, and if you couldn't make identical 
real rooms it would be easy to make identical virtual rooms.
