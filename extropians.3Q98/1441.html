<p>
Well, I'll speak up then and say that I wouldn't describe my attitude
towards women as "treasuring" them.  I've been married almost 20 years
and love my wife very much, but she is a highly exceptional woman.

<p>
Most of the people I have found interesting and intellectually stimulating
have been men rather than women.  That's just my personal taste, yours
may differ.

<p>
I do feel that having a variety of viewpoints in a discussion is
beneficial.  Since there are so few women involved in the areas I am
interested in, those few who do share those interests are unusually
valued simply because of their different perspective.  But this is not
a strong consideration, and I judge people more by how interesting and
challenging their views are rather than by their sex.

<p>
It's also true that a majority of the people who share my interests
seem to be like me in other ways than sex.  They tend to be white,
and from a similar European/American cultural background.  It's a pretty
homogeneous group.  Diversity is welcomed but ranks lower than provocative
ideas to me.

<p>
(I hope no one takes this to mean that I think women or people from other<br>
cultures don't create good ideas.  My use of "provocative", "interesting"
and "challenging" represents an expression of my personal interests,
and others will have different tastes.)

<p>
Hal
