hi!


<p>
<a href="1557.html#1582qlink1">&gt; Turns out EVERY person in the starting made a</a><br>
<i>&gt; lot of money, bummer.  They made their money by promising every person to make</i><br>
<i>&gt; their investment back within 90 days or refund their money, and held up to it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; by contract.  </i><br>
i can not understand in any way, how people can still be so stupid to
fall for pyramid scams or other rip-off schemes.
of course every person in the starting makes a lot of money, that's why
it is called pyramid
<br>
scheme !!!!

<p>
<a href="1557.html#1582qlink2">&gt; This was a legit company, with a building and lawyers and other things.  Something like that </a><br>
<i>&gt; would be wonderful again.</i><br>
<a name="1583qlink1">it doesn't help in any way. i know of a pyramid scam in germany</a> (where
pyramid schemes are not allowed by the government) where they covered
the systems by trading appartment shares.
this was also quite a big company, they made meeting-parties with the
customers and alike.
<br>
and all of a sudden, the head dissappeared with the money :).

<p>
everyone who still falls for stuff like this truly deserves having lost
his money.

<p>
get some tech stocks if you want to make money fast...


<p>
yours
