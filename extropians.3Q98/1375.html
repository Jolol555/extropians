<a name="1381qlink1"><a name="1379qlink1">I can´t believe that the "extropians" are discussing things such as 
gender and sex and female extropians...Spring time has gone!!</a> :-)

<p>
Does that really matter to the ones whose main purpose is "to 
increase intelligence" and so</a> on?????

<p>
I really can't believe this...after all, this is one of the oldest 
discussions of all, there's nothing new to it and don't think you can 
add anything new, so...we could start another intituled "Man are from 
Mars and Women are from Venus", which is the same as speaking about 
"hot female Extropians"...


<p>
<a name="1412qlink1"><a name="1381qlink2">By the way, besides man, women and gay do you also want to know 
anything else?? Is there any cats among us??? And chickens??? :-)

<p>
I think more important to the extropian list is to know for example our 
nationality and tastes. If you want to know WHO are the extropians, 
there's lots of things (and more important) to know besides gender...</a></a>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; watch the wailing and gnashing of teeth.  the fact is, *we dont know who we</i><br>
<i>&gt; are.*</i><br>
<i>&gt; we have no statistics on those who read the extropian newsgroup.  many, if not</i><br>
<i>&gt; most</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the email addresses are nongendered, such as spike66 for instance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; i see that extropians tend to love privacy.  althoprivacy is not important to me</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; personally, i have gotten religion on the necessity of others to protect theirs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; so, question:  how can we find out how many women and how many men, how</i><br>
<i>&gt; many straight and how many gay, or just plain how many people are out there in</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt; *without any single person having to reaveal any traceable information* about</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; if we set up a website where anyone could anonymously log on and set down</i><br>
<i>&gt; gender and preference, then any one person could corrupt the entire database by</i><br>
<i>&gt; logging</i><br>
<i>&gt; on an indefinite number of times and in putting false information.  the person</i><br>
<i>&gt; who started the lesbian extropian meme might intentionally do this, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; instance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; on the other hand, if we had every respondant register in order to prevent</i><br>
<i>&gt; multiple</i><br>
<i>&gt; entries, then each response could be traced to an individual.  the most private</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropians (understandably) would not log on, which would also corrupt the</i><br>
<i>&gt; database.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; so, i set forth this challange to all extropians:  come up with a means of</i><br>
<i>&gt; polling</i><br>
<i>&gt; the group in such a way that prevents any individual from logging on repeatedly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; without revealing the source of any single entry to protect the privacy of those</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; who answer the poll.  it must be done online, no writing on dead trees or</i><br>
<i>&gt; postage</i><br>
<i>&gt; stamps.  to the person who discovers such a means, i offer the grand prize of...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; my undying admiration and deepest gratitude.  {8^)  spike</i><br>
