Dear Friends,

<p>
In 1997, Celestis, Inc. received one of the Space Frontier Foundation's
top awards for demonstrating a brand new commercial space market
-- space memorial services.  Now Celestis is getting ready to announce
their participation in the development of another new space market,
as part of a venture called "Encounter 2001: The Millennial Voyage."

<p>
<a name="1077qlink2">Encounter 2001 will launch a spacecraft in 2001 and carry the writings,
drawings, photos and DNA samples (in the form of human hair) of millions
of people from around the world.</a>  The spacecraft will use a gravity
assist maneuver at Jupiter to propel itself out of the Solar System.
This New Year's Eve -- Dec. 31, 1998 -- Encounter 2001 will "place
a cosmic call" by transmitting the first of a series of deep space radio
transmissions to other star systems so as to announce the mission -- and
the names of Encounter participants -- to the galactic community.  The
price for all this is only $49.95, making Encounter 2001 a space mission
in which anyone can participate.

<p>
We at ProSpace are always looking for ways to involve the American
people in the space frontier.  ProSpace often calls upon you to support
legislation on Capitol Hill that encourages private sector activities in
space.  As Americans, we understand the idea that free enterprise is
the means by which we will truly open this frontier to all people.  But
Celestis and Encounter 2001 are more than just ideas -- they are
realities. Entrepreneurial space enterprises that succeed in the
marketplace of goods and services help ProSpace succeed in the
marketplace of ideas. Success stories like Celestis show policy makers,
the investment community, and the public that space is a place where
everyone can participate.  A place where everybody wants to participate.

<p>
Your participation in Encounter 2001 will help ProSpace in a more
tangible way as well.  If you decide to participate in Encounter 2001 be
sure to **mention** "ProSpace" when you order: not only will part of
the proceeds of your purchase go to ProSpace, but you'll get a 10%
discount off the $49.95 price.  (Note that there is an additional $9.95
shipping&amp; handling charge.)  Once you order you will receive:  a limited
edition, commemorative poster; an archival form (for your message and
photo); a numbered membership card; a flight certificate; a collector's
pin; and a DNA sampling kit.  For more information about Encounter 2001
visit their website at <a href="http://www.encounter2001.com">http://www.encounter2001.com</a>  (Celestis is found at
<a href="http://www.celestis.com">http://www.celestis.com</a>).  You can place your order through their website,
or by printing out the order form below.

<p>
Both Celestis and Encounter 2001 will have booths at "Space Fair '98", a
space tourism exhibit on the Queen Mary in Long Beach July 17 through
26.  If you will be in southern California during that time be sure to
stop by the Queen Mary.  Exhibitors such as NASA, Lockheed Martin, and
the Civilian Astronaut Corp, will also be there.  Admission to Space Fair '98
is free, although there is a $6.00 per car parking fee.  The hours of the
show are 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM.

<p>
PLAN Ahead for Christmas!! -- Encounter 2001 makes the perfect
unique Christmas present.  Tell your loved ones that you are giving them
the most fantastic trip of their lifetime; a trip out of the Solar System.

    "Far better it is to dare mighty things,
<pre>
     to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure,
     than to rank with those poor spirits
     who neither enjoy nor suffer much
     because they live in the gray twilight 
     that knows neither victory nor defeat."

                   - Theodore Roosevelt
