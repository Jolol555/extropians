doh...go on vacation for a week and miss a good dust-up over
creationists..my only comment is to agree that "creationists" are no more a
monolithic group than are "scientists" or "taxi drivers".  And no, they
don't all think the universe is 4000 years old...

re information:

  My own intuition is that the

<a href="0073.html#0456qlink1">&gt;Universe is actually a big lump of instantiated MATH.  The math is not so</a><br>
<i>&gt;much a processing system, but a description of the way information CAN</i><br>
<i>&gt;interact with itself.  A facile analogy is to throw a bunch of cubes into a</i><br>
<i>&gt;box and start shaking it.  Sooner or later the cubes will start lining up.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is not due to a system "processing" the cubes but simply reflects that</i><br>

and Hara Ra replied:

"Well ... you need both the description AND its instantiation. In this case,
the description of the cubes is the math, but the cubes themselves and
shaking the box are also needed. And these days it is abundantly clear that
having only the description is not going to be much help in describing what
happens."

<p>
You've missed the point....you don't need no description.  Them cubes will
line up however they are "described". Its what cubes do.  And I don't know
what your last sentance means, except that the "abundantly clear" reminds me
of people who give you directions..as soon as they say "you can't miss it"
you know you're going to get lost.
