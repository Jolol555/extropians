I couldn't agree with you more on the Cocteau Twins...they are really
bionic! I saw them live and they had a really intresting blend of
computer-controlled rhythms and sheer human emotion...
I met Elizibeth Frasier! she's sooo cute! I was standing outside
Roseland NYC after the show and the whole band came out! I shook her
hand.

<p>
Anyway I also think Dead Can Dance and Portishead are really extropic,
They are both uploading folk music, if you can understand that...storing
ancient aesthetic knowledge. Deep Forest is another extropic group. I
think that using computers and synthesizers to store, manipulate and
perform ancient musics is a really extropic endeavor.

<p>
Anyway just thought i'd add my two cents...
