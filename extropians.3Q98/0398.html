<p>
I dunno about him, but *I* would.  We ban other
sorts of crime, right?  Why not organized crime,
too?

<p>
<a href="0368.html#0398qlink3">&gt;Are you kidding?  It's not the train or bus ticket (about 35 dollars or</a><br>
so
<br>
<a href="0368.html#0398qlink4">&gt;every few hundred miles via Greyhound) it's the finding a place to stay</a><br>
and a
<br>
<i>&gt;job after one arrives at where ever one is going.  The job markets in</i><br>
rural
<br>
<a href="0368.html#0398qlink5">&gt;areas tend to be more constricted.</a><br>

<p>
But this isn't likely to be a problem, as few
enough people will *want* to leave that the
rural "job market" won't be overloaded.

<p>
<a href="0283.html#0398qlink6">&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt;But what's further, I don't think that anyone should HAVE to </a><br>
<i>&gt;leave.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Fine; you can think what you like, but reality doesn't give a damn</i><br>
about
<br>
<a href="0368.html#0398qlink7">&gt; "should" or "should not". If they wish they're free to stay there and </a><br>
<i>&gt; die in defence of their beliefs, but they'll die just the same. &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You miss the point.  Instead of merely accepting that millions and</i><br>
possibly
<br>
<a href="0368.html#0398qlink8">&gt;more will die via terrorist attack, I think that there is a moral</a><br>
imperative
<br>
<a href="0368.html#0398qlink9">&gt;to take measures to reduce that possibility, ideally to nil.</a><br>

<p>
Moral imperatives are all very fine, *if* there
is a possibility of accomplishing it.  I agree 
with Mark in that I see no way to affect the 
probability of widespread disaster in the near
future.  The Foresight Institute, private launch
companies, and so on are already doing more
than I could do for that, so the next thing to 
worry about is making sure that *I* and my
friends/acquaintences/family survive.  BTW,
I think that this is something we should be 
working on somewhat more actively.
