Subject: Are guns extropian?

<p>
<a href="0481.html#0501qlink1">&gt;I don't want to say guns are bad, or argue about guns per se.</a><br>

<p>
As a European it seems obvious to me that guns or no guns is a choice. There
are basically two scenarios. "No guns at all", which most European countries
wants, and "at least a gun pr. person." which many Americans wants.

<p>
Many of you Americans feels in your hearts and souls that you have the right
to defend youreselves with guns, and I can fully appreciate this. I don't
agree, but then we don't have to.

<p>
All this throwing statistics around is just a mental exercise in
interpretation. (statistics, more statistics and damn lies :-)) It is really
just a way to justify ones oppinions. I find it pretty fruitless though.

<p>
<a name="0570qlink1"><a name="0508qlink1">One thing is for shure. For most Europeans this gun debate is a complete
turn-off, and can be a very negative factor when reading this list. There is
far to much debate on this list concerning guns!!!!</a></a>

<p>
Normally I as a European don't consider guns at all because I don't have to.
I don't even consider violence because it has no place in my daily life.
(Murders pro capita here in Denmark is 1/10 of that in the States.)

<p>
Doesn't this Gun debate belong someplace else???? I cannot for the life of
me se what it has got to do with Transhumanism and Extropy. Also it is a
very American problem.<a name="0508qlink2"> Most Europeans doesn't have it and doesn't want it
and don't se the gun debate as a problem at all because it doesn't exist and
no one miss</a> it.
