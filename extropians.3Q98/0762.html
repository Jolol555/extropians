<p>
My instant critical thinking response to this is: 
Who was it that started this thread about gender? As far as I can tell, it
was males.

<p>
My instant social psychologist's response is:
If you think gender is a non-issue for those who wish to transform their
lives in an extropian direction, then you need to get away from your
computer, come out of your darkened room and look at the real world around
you. Gender stereotypes (often aided and abetted by  alleged scientific
evidence) have stifled the lives and personalities of both males and
females for centuries and ARE STILL DOING SO. Some extropians have made
much progress in breaking free of these chains but if you think no
extropian has such chains, you are very naive indeed. The question of how
much is genetic and how flexible gender roles are is important needed
information in understanding how transformations to more balanced, rational
and creative lives can be facilitated.
