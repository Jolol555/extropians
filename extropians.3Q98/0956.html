Although scientists continue to hunt for cold fusion, the US Department
of Energy gave the fledgling technology the cold shoulder long ago. That
does not mean, however, that the federal government is averse to funding
far-fetched scientific research. 

<p>
In the past three years, to the astonishment of many physicists, the
Department of Defense has invested more than US$400,000 in Magnetic
Power of Sebastopol, California. The company claims to have perfected a
revolutionary material that conducts electricity with no resistance at
room temperature.

                     by Steve Brody and Andrew Kirkis

                     Although scientists continue to hunt for cold
fusion,
                     the US Department of Energy gave the fledgling
                     technology the cold shoulder long ago. That does
not
                     mean, however, that the federal government is
averse
                     to funding far-fetched scientific research. 

                     In the past three years, to the astonishment of
many
                     physicists, the Department of Defense has invested
                     more than US$400,000 in Magnetic Power of
                     Sebastopol, California. The company claims to have
                     perfected a revolutionary material that conducts
                     electricity with no resistance at room temperature.
Its
                     so-called UltraConductors would allow ideal
efficiency
                     in every industrial application from electric
motors to
                     permanent electromagnets and would never need to be
                     recharged. 

                     In short, Magnetic Power is in the business of
                     perpetual motion. 

<br>
                     "Prior to the Wright brothers, no one believed<br>
flying
                     machines would ever be built," said CEO Mark
</pre>
Goldes.

                     Standard superconductors conduct without resistance
                     only at subzero temperatures and, owing to the
                     cumbersome refrigeration requirements, they have
                     never really left the lab. So why isn't the physics
                     community interested in this radical new discovery? 

<br>
                     "Quite frankly, no one believes it," said Los<br>
Alamos
                     National Laboratory superconductivity expert Martin
                     Maley, whose sentiments were echoed by other
                     physicists like Paul Grant at the Electric Power
                     Research Institute in Palo Alto, California.
According
                     to both Maley and Grant, after three years and
                     hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer
revenue,
                     nobody can even confirm that they've seen such a
                     material, including the military. 

                     So-called room-temperature superconductors -- which
                     arise periodically in the research community only
to be
                     quickly disproven -- usually provoke little more
than
                     chortles. 

                     But there's nothing funny about handing out
                     government funds to a company promising cold fusion
                     or room-temperature superconductors without at
least
                     some reasonable investigation of the claim. This
sort
                     of inquiry seems curiously absent in the case of
                     Magnetic Power. 

                     According to information available on the
Department
                     of Defense and Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization,
                     or BMDO, Web sites, Magnetic Power received
                     $287,000 from the US Air Force and $120,000 from
the
                     BMDO through Magnetic Power's wholly owned
                     subsidiary, Room Temperature Superconductors Inc.
                     (ROOTS). 

                     All funding was granted through the Small Business
                     Innovative Research programs for the development of
                     applications of room-temperature superconductors. 

                     In superconductivity circles, the history of
Magnetic
                     Power and its UltraConductors is alternately
described
                     by critics as "funny" and "appalling." 

<br>
                     "In the nearly 20 years since this claim was first<br>
made,
                     there has not been one independent confirmation by
a
                     reputable research institute," said Maley. "Some
                     samples of UltraConductor have been sent out, but
                     never one large enough to perform a standard
                     conductivity measurement. Until that happens, no
one
                     will really believe the technology exists." 

                     No one except the BMDO and the US Air Force, that
                     is. 

                     Jeff Bond, a BMDO program manager, explained that
                     companies are not required to prove their ability
to
                     produce the proposed technology for Phase 1 Small
                     Business Innovative Research proposals. If granted,
                     Bond said, the funding typically amounts to a
$60,000
                     grant and the funds are intended to allow the
company
                     to "prove the concept." 

                     Yet Magnetic Power's proposals do not say the
                     company will devise room-temperature
                     superconductors. Rather, it intends to develop and
                     improve on the materials that one grant proposal
says
<br>
                     "have been invented." Nonetheless, Bond said he is<br>
                     unaware of any samples of UltraConductor that have
                     been received or tested by the military. 

<br>
                     "We must have a good reason to believe that a given<br>
                     company is proposing the development of a
legitimate
                     technology, before we grant a [Small Business
                     Innovative Research proposal]," said Bond. 

<br>
                     "However, with the sheer number of proposals that<br>
we
                     receive each year, it is certainly possible that a
few
                     inadequate Phase 1 proposals will slip by. The
Phase 2
                     grants, which are much larger, have a much more
                     stringent review process." 

                     That process added another $187,500 to Magnetic
                     Power's budget in 1997, when the Air Force approved
                     a Phase 2 proposal for the company. 

                     Magnetic Power's Goldes says that the BMDO has
                     observed testing of its materials and has received
                     samples, but that public announcement of the grants
                     has been suppressed by the military because of the
                     sensitive nature of the technology. 

                     In fact, abstracts for all three are readily
available via a
                     search on the defense department's Web-site
                     database. 

<br>
                     "We are well aware of who is funding what, and if<br>
                     these companies keep reapplying for Phase 1 grants
                     without producing results, they will be quickly
weeded
                     out of the process," said Bond. 

                     However, while being interviewed, Bond found that
                     Magnetic Power's ROOTS had just been approved for
                     a second Ballistic Missile Defense Organization
Phase
                     1 proposal, submitted under a different topic
listing
                     from the first. Bond was also unfamiliar with the
parent
                     company Magnetic Power, the name used to apply for
                     both Air Force grants. Goldes is CEO of both
                     companies and said he has 10 employees. 

                     He also said that he is expecting to receive
another
                     $750,000 from the BMDO for a future Phase 2
proposal
                     to build on his Phase 1 work, bringing the bounty
to
                     nearly $1.2 million dollars. 

                     On the bright side, one Air Force representative of
the
                     grant program pointed out, "At least we didn't fund
                     cold fusion."
