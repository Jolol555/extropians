<p>
Transhumanism is humanism without the limits imposed by a narrow
definition of "human."  Why must a humans die?  Why must humans feel
pain? Why must a human be made of flesh?  These are the questions that
transhumanists ask each other and themselves every day, and the questions
that humanists gave up on millenia ago.

<p>
<a href="0901.html#0905qlink2">&gt; What prominent thinkers are associated with transhumanism?</a><br>

<p>
Epicurus, Hume, Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, FM-2030, Max More
(these are my associations, they may not be representative)

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; -It is definitely not a cult. Although it is not a religion it </i><br>
<i>&gt; seems to fill the same niche in our mind as religion does.</i><br>

<p>
Transhumanism describes-- it describes a general covergence of values
among like-minded individuals. It describes a unrelenting desire to live
and a defiant disregard for the present limits of the human race.
  
<p>
Religions dictate-- they dictate rules, morales, and values.  They 
dictates how to live and how to die.

<p>
<a name="0916qlink1">(in addition to the already stated empirical evidence approach, I have
provided an answer for those who prefers semantics and "logic" to
empiricism...)

<p>
For a spirit to interact with matter&amp;energy, it would by definition have
to BE a form of matter&amp;energy.  If it is useful(or spiritually imperative) 
to separate matter&amp;energy into that which is considered the "soul" and
that which is not, this separation can be accommodated in the uploading
process.  

<p>
Thus, by simple logic, it is appparent that even those who believe in a
soul can be uploaded without compromising their faith.  Transhumanism is
therefore compatible with any religion that does not explicity state "Thou
shalt not upload!"

<a href="0901.html#0905qlink5">&gt; Is there transhumanist art?</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [Natasha, open the floodgates!] </i><br>

<p>
[E. Shaun Russell might also have some comments..]

<p>
My answer:  Yes.  To the transhumanist, living is the highest form of
artistic expression.  Without the constraints of standarized morales and
pontifficated "ethics," the transhumanist is free to execute his
daily activites entirely for their artistic value.  There are no regrets
that an action has defied a higher purpose; transhuman art justifies
itself, since the artist is accountable only to himself.(/herself/itself)
