A person suffering from mental illness might feel
the urge to constantly open doors, but if you open
a door we don't consider you "mentally ill." In
the same way, why are acts of self-defence and
even (in some cases) premeditated murder
considered "violent"? The term violence, to my
mind is over generalised. I think we should make a
clearer distinction between the rational use of
weapons and the violent use of weapons (presuming
violence to be irrational and erratic behaviour).

<p>
I'm quite sure an advanced rational civilisation
is likely to still use weapons and "violent"
means. IMHO, killing someone who will cause a
great deal of trouble is a rational option.

<i>&gt; Utopian society can clearly, rationally and</i><br>
<i>&gt; freely try to set itself apart from.</i><br>

<p>
But first we need to understand the difference
between a rational act of self-defence (or
offence) and a violent attack. I support the
freedom to carry a weapon and the freedom to kill
by direct or indirect action.
