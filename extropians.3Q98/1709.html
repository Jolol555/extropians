<a href="1667.html#1709qlink1">: I have evidence indicating that the rumor about the censored</a><br>

Huh? I've got a private mail telling me if I send them $5 I'll get 
$100000 in a month. Do you believe that too? I take offence at someone 
saying they have an email from someone they wont disclose containing 
evidence they cant show us that happens to prove I am trying to do 
something. Im sure that would hold up in court! Erik's posts were gone. 
They are back now, no doubt due to the fact that I caught a few people 
trying to censor Erik. Did I delete the posts? *No* I just pointed out 
they were gone.

<p>
I'd love to hear this *evidence* you have. I can't wait to hear this. 
Either you have fabricated evidence that someone created to protect 
themselves or you are just lying. I call to attention that someone is 
being censored. Other posters agreed it was an appalling situation. What 
do I get in return? Some punk hiding behind an email address saying I'm 
full of crap.<a name="1719qlink2"> Either retract that bull or provide us all with your 
</a>evidence. I cant imagine people agree with the tactics Bostrom is 
pulling here.
