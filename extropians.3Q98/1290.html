I think you know damn well what I'm talking about...

<a href="1288.html#1290qlink2">&gt; &gt;&gt;Hardly. Natasha, for example, is pretty hot, and she's one of our inspired</a><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Thank you Mike Lorrey for your rational thinking.</i><br>

<p>
Smooth joke, Natasha! We all know of course that Mike's brain was severely deprived of blood when he wrote that, for obvious reasons ;-)
 
<p>
<a href="1288.html#1290qlink3">&gt; Yes Mike, Natasha is really hot but since she is "taken" or unavailable (you</a><br>
<i>&gt; lucky guy Max!). Us single Transhumanist guys can't really count her because</i><br>
<i>&gt; of this.  Remi and Katherine Aegis are the only other posting messengers to</i><br>
<i>&gt; this list that I can think of.  I don't know their availability status.</i><br>

<p>
To the best of my knowledge Remi is a man, and Katherine's gay, so try again<a name="1306qlink1"> ;-) In fact, I dare you to find one hot, reasonably young and available woman on this mailing list. Or the known transhuman community as a whole, for that matter.</a>
