<p>
Yes, this more accurately reflects the current understanding among
psychologists.

<p>
I'm not so sure about this.  You appear to suggest</a> that the behavioral
patterns which make up our personality exist because we prefer those traits
over others.  As I'm sure you're aware, personality is also a product of
complex interactions between our genes and the environment (neither of which
we have a whole lot of control over).  I think many people have personality
traits that they don't particularly value.  Many introverts, for example,
might prefer to be more socially competent and outgoing.  Many who are
impulsive would prefer to be have greater control.  Some who rely heavily on
thinking through everything in a highly rational manner might prefer to have
better intuitive skills and vice versa.  I think most people would try to
achieve a greater balance if they could pick and choose personality traits
(a little more of this, a little less of that).  They might try to tailor
their personality to be more congruent with their career to enhance their
success and work satisfaction. They might make changes designed to enrich
their relationship with a significant other and gain the satisfaction that
comes with enhanced intimacy.  Too large of a change would, I agree, be too
scary for most.
