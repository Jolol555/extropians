I think the best model we can use in a discussion on trying to
understand (or at least predict) the actions of a more complex
mentality, subject to drives &amp; selective pressures of which we have no
direct experience,<a name="0978qlink1"> is that of a group of children trying to fathom the
ways of adults; it is IMO the closest analogue</a> to the the problem at
hand, that of someone on one side of a dramatic phase-change
<br>
(Singularity) trying to understand those who have already gone through<br>
it.  It has the added advantage of being a situation which most if not
all of us have been in,
<br>
giving a common reference point.  

<p>
This model has one major drawback;  as
<br>
kids, we saw adults all around us, so we at least had some data to
speculate from.
<br>
In the present discussion, we of course are engaged in pure speculation.

<p>
Anyway, using this model to think about the possible actions &amp;
motivations of a posthuman being, I for one can only come to the
conclusion that at this point in time,
<br>
no meaningful statements can be made;
<br>
all our speculations sre on par with a child
saying "When I grow up, I'm gonna do __"
<br>
(fill in the blank).  <br>

<p>
This isn't meant to disparage our speculations;  it's normal &amp;
productive to think about what you want to be when you grow up/pass the
Singularity, etc.  Still, I like this model because it holds out the
possibility that we will have our questions answered &amp; will look back on
them with fond amusement once we personally have
reached the other side of the Singularity &amp;
look back @ the children we are now as the posthumans we will have
become.
