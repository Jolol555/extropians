In one of Arthur C. Clarke's non-fiction books he talks about an experiment
one of those famous dead white dudes (Haldane?) once did with toy guns. He
set up a traditional Western movie 'high-noon' shootout and discovered that 
the person who drew second almost always shot first; the first draw was consciously controlled and hence slower than the second person's instinctive reaction.

<p>
On that basis we could say that in most cases the hotheads will be at a
disadvantage.

<a name="0457qlink1">Of course we could also ignore theorising and actually look at places 
</a>like Florida and Israel where many people routinely carry guns and the 
murder rates dropped significantly, but that's just reality and hence
irrelevant to anti-gun discussions.
