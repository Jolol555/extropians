A weapon is not advanced or primitive, it is either functional or not.
(Btw, for the record: I would be rather a bruised, but living
hillbilly, than a stone dead futurist).

<p>
A capsicaine spray or a taser are less effective than even a crude DIY
electrically ignited graphite/kevlar muzzle loader [lead azide
rocket rounds?] with a laser pointer as aiming aid. If that's too low 
tech for you, consider using a power NIR laser diode array to 
blind your opponent (he must face you then with his eyes open, then, 
and you could easily blind yourself by a reflex if not equipped 
with selective absorption goggles/LED shutter mirrorshades), or 
make a one-time pyrodriven few-ml aluminum trialkyle dispenser 
(_not_ a good thing to fire in a room, or from a close distance). 
All more-or-less higher tech than a gun, but somewhat difficult 
to build, unproven, and thus possibly unreliable, and certainly 
dangerous to operate.  

<p>
Disintegration rays? What's that? A particle beam weapon? 
A _wearable_ one? At ambient air pressure? Get serious.

<p>
In any case it is difficult to match operation reliability and 
ergonomical characteristics of a well designed mainstream gun,
especially if you're trained in its use. A high-velocity pellet is
still the most efficient way to deliver energy to the target, and
in terms of energy density and release characteristics, a pyrocharge 
is still the most convenient energy conserve. Against targets other
than soft or armor you could use giant microwave bursts, but these are 
likely to be hardened against EMP, and the generator is certainly not
wearable.
