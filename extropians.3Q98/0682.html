<p>
I gather that you are claiming that it's been proven that there is a
genetic basis for homosexuality.</a> 

<p>
<a name="0694qlink1">I'm a psychologist who has read a LOT of the original research in the areas
of gender, gender roles (one of my specialties), and sexual preference.  My
reaction to the above statement is HA-HA. We are FAR from "proving" one way
or another what the genetic bases (or lack of such ) for gender roles and
sexual preferences are.  The studies are slippery, fraught with
methodological problems, small in size, contradictory and highly
controversial. For every one that provides evidence FOR a genetic basis,
there is a study that fails to support it. We jut don't know yet -- so
please don't make such claims in an area that I suspect is outside your
area of expertise.  If I'm wrong about the issue of expertise, I'm prepared
to play dueling studies with you at some point(well, that is, if I have the
time!).   If this is outside your expertise, then you might do well to read
a little more before you make such claims.</a>

In another post, Jim Barnebee said:
<br>
"All of this information can be obtained in the 
Discovery Channel's special called "Brain Sex". I belive these studies 
are referenced and explained in the third hour of the documentary."

<p>
The book on which this documentary was based is one of the most
intellectually dishonest books I have ever read. I can dispute almost every
page with studies that show the contrary, studies that were conveniently
overlooked by the authors. 

<p>
In fact, here is an outline of a critique that I use in my presentations on
the subject of gender.

<p>
Critique of Brain Sex 
<br>
(book by Anne Moir, Ph.D. and David Jessel)

<p>
Purports to show research evidence for differences in the brain that
provide a biological basis for gender-related behavior.


<OL>
  <li> 	Distorts by omission. Fails to cite researchers who contradict them or
reach 
different conclusions. No mention of contrary studies.
For example: 
  <li>  Ehrhardt is in bibliography but not mentioned in text. Her conclusions
about prenatal hormonal abnormalities is very different than theirs. .
  <li>  Kinsbourne, a researcher in brain-hemisphere differences, concludes that
no reliable sex difference exist.

  <li> 	No mention of the critiques of studies they cite.
	For example:
  <li>  Ehrhardt’s review of research on abnormal prenatal
 hormones 
  <li>  Ehrhardt’s critique of Dominican Republic study .
  <li>  Fausto-Sterling’s "Myths of Gender" (though it’s in
bibliography)
  <li>  Ruth Bleier’s critiques

  <li> 	Distort findings and exaggerates size of differences.
Ex: "Most women cannot read a map as well as a man."  No study backs that
up. Even in spatial abilities, the overlap is greater that the differences.

  <li> 	Claims many sex differences are well-established and noncontroversial
that are in fact not!
For example:
Sex differences in math, verbal and spatial abilities--contrary to what
they claim, the consensus in psychology is that differences in math and
verbal abilities have disappeared and differences in spatial abilities,
while consistent, are not great enough to explain behavioral differences.


</OL>
<p>
Brain hemisphere differences--still very controversial. 

<p>
5.  Innuendoes that mislead because no research backs them up; pure
speculation
<br>
 "could it be that…"   "may be…" 
 
<p>
6.  Lies

<p>
"Virtually every professional scientist and researcher has concluded that
the brains of men and women are different."
"Even researchers most hostile to the acknowledgment of sex differences
agree that [aggression] is a male feature, and one which cannot be
explained by social conditioning."

<p>
These statements are patent falsehoods. Researchers that they cite in their
bibliography would disagree with these statements, let alone the
researchers they leave out.

<p>
For example:
<br>
Anke Ehrhardt, Heino Meyer-Bahlburg, John Money
Marcel Kinsbourne, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Ruth Bleier, Ruth Hubbard, Janet
Hyde, Carol Tavris

<p>
END OF OUTLINE

<p>
A far better book on the subject is "Sex on the Brain" by Deborah Blum
I don't even agree with all of this book --it still gives short shrift to
psychology and social conditioning (the author is a journalist who
specializes in biological science) -- but at least she is careful and
measured in her conclusions and seems quite honest in her attempt to
present the research accurately ---as opposed to "Brain Sex" which is a bad
joke.

<p>
On the opposite end (re conclusions) from "Brain Sex" is "Myths of Gender"
by Anne Fausto-Sterling (a biology prof at Brown)who is excellent at
showing the faulty reasoning behind a lot of the pop articles and some of
the studies.

<p>
The moral of all this is: before you make assertations in controversial
areas, be sure to read more than one side of the debate. [If the above
writers HAVE read the books I cited, then they are entitled to their
opinion but are still misleading in their comments. My guess is that they
have not read these books. Tell me if I'm wrong --ha-ha, I'm sure you will!]
