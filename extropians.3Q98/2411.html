Yes!  Exactly!  The typical stereotype about AIs assume that they behave like
repressed humans, which is typically the only analogy the hack writer has to
emotionless things.  Thus, also, the stereotype of eventual rebellion.  But
all of our rebellion/dominance emotions are the results of long years of
evolution; they don't pop up spontaneously.  If you don't program an emotion
into an AI, it simply isn't there.

<p>
I do have to point out one minor consequence of "If you don't program your</a> AI
to want or need anything, it won't do anything spontaneously."  It won't do
anything at all, internally or externally - not if you've designed it
properly, so that making any choice requires a goal.  If you add something
that the AI does automatically, you've done the equivalent of punching a goal
into the architecture, which is bad for the various aforesaid reasons.

<p>
So the AI does need at least one nonzero goal, and it needs to have it in the
initial state (because otherwise it won't have the will to reason it out), but
the goal has to be an ordinary, justified, noncircular, reconsiderable goal
that the AI could have come up with on its own.  Inventing a goal like that is
a nontrivial task; it takes considerable basic intelligence to represent the
goal logic, much less verify it.  If you have an initial goal that doesn't
require much architecture to represent, the goal is almost certainly arbitrary.
