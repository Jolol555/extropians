I highly doubt that, or even if the current Patent Commissioner said that, that
there are no legal grounds to support such a stance. I'm sure there are plenty of
sex toys out there that have patents granted on them....likewize I'm sure there are
plenty of extremely nasty porno mags and videos out there that are likewize
protected by copyrights. I do happen to know that there are several devices for
executing humans which are patented, which clearly violate the consitutional
prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, and are thus legally 'immoral',
yet still have patents granted.

<p>
If this is true, I'd like to see the Patent Office's philosophical proof of the
immorality of a human/animal gengineered organism.
