<p>
In discussing a business proposal with a friend, a question came up that I
didn't have the answer to and I'm disseminating it as widely as possible to
see what sources of information I might find.  Does anyone on the list have
access to data about the economics of discount retailers?  In particular, I'm
looking for the unit costs that retailers like Fry's and Circuit City face
that are attributable to "bricks and mortar", i.e. the costs they incur in
maintaining a physical retail outlet and any warehouses and internal
distribution infrastructure they maintain.  I'd appreciate any information or
leads anyone might be able to offer.

<p>
Sorry if this is a little off-list...
