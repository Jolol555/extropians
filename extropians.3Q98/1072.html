<i>&gt; &gt; This component of the FAQ needs *excruciating* sensitivity.  Almost</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; bio-botanical sense) if the suggestion might be better expressed as: if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; could design plants and vegetables that include certain animal genes, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; might be able to `grow steaks' in the same way we now grow tomatos or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lettuces.  [If that *doesn't* make sense for energetic reasons, we need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rephrase the brainless cows scenario more delicately.]</i><br>

<p>
Due to thousands of years of breeding, cows already have one of, if not the
smallest brain/'body weight ratios of all mammals, so they are already
effectively lobotomized. THey have about the minimum brain mass necessary to be
what they are.

<a name="1086qlink1"><a name="1085qlink1"><a name="1079qlink1">A more effective thing to do to reduce the 'uck' factor is to engineer the cow to
be more ugly, thus reducing the 'cute' factor from which the 'yuck' factor is
derived. Most animal rightists, even the most casual ones, are usually motivated
to avoid eating animals because of what we hunters call the 'Bambi Syndrome',</a> and
this is why they usually focus their efforts on saving and protecting 'cute'
animals, while they do little for ugly animals. You don't get many protesters
trying to protect the Great White Shark.....</a>

<a href="1044.html#1072qlink2">&gt; What about an animal version of hydroponics; simply growing the</a><br>
<i>&gt; muscle tissue in a nutrient culture.  Surely a more easily grown</i><br>
<i>&gt; version could be genetically engineered.  Besides, brainless cattle</i><br>
<i>&gt; couldn't graze, anyway.  It would be inefficient to grow all the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; cow constituents (hide, organs, skeleton, etc.) just to obtain a steak.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1079qlink2">A much more efficient method of producing meat is to breed rabbits, but they
obviously are much farther up the 'cute' scale than cows are. Rabbits reproduce
far faster, and produce much healthier meat than cattle, and especially important
for space applications, they don't take up much space. The rabbit was selected by
O'Neil's space colony research project for protein supply.</a>
