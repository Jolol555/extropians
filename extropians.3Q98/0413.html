<p>
I subsequently requested some examples of rational ethics and was directed
to your earlier posts which I read and enjoyed.  Thanks.  You concluded that
your preferred ethical standard is utilitarianism which you described as;

<p>
<i>&gt;"The right action is that which is most likely to maximize the total</i><br>
well-being and total number of all people.&lt;

<p>
The second half of that standard is nicely objective and may be easily
measured and appears to be in agreement with Bradley Felton's hypothesis;

<p>
<a href="0387.html#0413qlink2">&gt; Actually, there is one objective metric available, one which we are</a><br>
currently being judged against, and which our ancestors have all been held
accountable to: reproductive success.  This is the only bedrock that I know
of upon which to build a rational ethics. &lt;

<p>
I generally agree with Bradley.  Behaviors which provided a practical
balance between the survival of self and the survival of others probably had
the strongest adaptive value and had much to do with what most people
currently believe they *should* do.

<p>
It's the first part of your statement that still makes me wince.  Your
opinion of what my well-being may or may not be is no more than that. . .an
opinion...purely subjective which was the point I was clumsily trying to
make earlier.  Maybe I don't understand what you mean by rationally derived.
Do you mean rules of mathematical logic must be followed?
