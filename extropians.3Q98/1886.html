<p>
Fair enough. Understandable. It all depends upon how fast the process 
goes. In terms of immediate priorities, the issue is primarily one of 
domestic animals first.<a name="1900qlink1"> In line with animal liberationists, I am 
proposing a law to make it illegal for human beings to kill animals.</a> 
Nanotech can enable very lowcost animal hospitals, for example. Any 
wider Ecoburst is likely to occur not in nanoyear but the second (or 
hour or weeks) of the Escalation/Singularity/Spike (or, for the sake of 
argument, over that year - I don't think true bootstrapping is going to 
take longer, particularly if SETI activates).

obviously correct as possibility.

<p>
<a href="1796.html#1886qlink3">"I see nothing wrong (and assume Andres agrees???) with helping others</a><br>
out.  My own strategy is to spread transhumanist/Extropian ideas as far

<p>
The battle will be against conservatives who attempt to restrict you or 
to restrict your options. You guys have not graphed out the wealth 
distribution across the nations and world properly. The top 350 
billionaires (1978) had equal wealth to the bottom 2,500,000,000 people, 
about half of the world's then population. Graph America's wealth 
distribution today. It looks like a Spike! Which makes sense, since it 
is a graph of consciousness. Imagine the behaviour of the Spike after 
nanoyear. It levels out, then as large scale engineering kicks in, it 
accelerates again.

<p>
Communism engulfed half the world because of the selfish behaviour of 
elites. It would be sensible to bear political and ethical issues in 
mind, from your own point of view. For example, you could make it clear 
you are not into slavery of any sort. AI systems at low levels can act 
out systems management like autonomous and sympathetic nervous systems 
rather than cortex activities. For example, you could make it clear that 
you believe the internal neurological activities of sentient beings are 
sacrosanct. For example, you could make it clear that people have the 
right of association at the level of group mind (i.e. neurological 
connections via Nets etc.).

<p>
<a name="1900qlink3">Perhaps what you need is a Transhumanist Bill of Rights that is simple 
and clear to moderately informed people.</a> Be the Thomas Jefferson, the 
Thomas Paine, of cyberspace! Remember the democracies of Greece, Italy 
and India in past centuries, amongst others. The British and French 
revolutions. America built on these other efforts, which were sustained 
for centuries in the face of intense pressures from oligarchies and the 
then necessities of laboured food production.

<p>
Well, we're animals, so perhaps you believe in slavery. Fair enough. I 
vote for any victim of any act of force to be offered assistance in 
terms of protection from aggressors. Trees currently have no 
neurological systems, so I define them as unthinking in our terms. 
Animals like ourselves do, so I define them as thinking. Any 
neurological limitations they may currently have are temporary in that 
both modification and communications difficulties can be overcome by any 
hypersentient or superintelligent self-directed lifeforms, which can 
consciously think on trillions upon trillions of levels simultaneously, 
enough to have a congruent conversation with every sentient creature on 
the planet.

<a href="1805.html#1886qlink5">"The problem with taking a reductionist's stance is it becomes difficult </a><br>
to determine when to stop reducing. Matter is just a temporary state of 
energy, do why dwell upon that state? Why dwell upon energy since it is 
an artifact of M-branes, D-branes, or P-Branes (depending on your 
preferred flavor)? Etc."

<p>
A neurological system is a neurological system, whether its matrix is 
energy or matter of whatever type. Moral and ethical rules within 
appropriate frameworks still apply. Under conditions of self-direction, 
frameworks are chosen. Insertion of neurological matrixes and sensory 
extensions into 'inert' matter or energy is indeed possible. There are 
no theoretical boundaries to such activity in logic, except respect for 
the choice of others. This is why Jupiter brains can be a subject of 
romantic speculation. (Indeed, like many others, I mentioned the 
possibility in my book of fiction (1994): "The boundary of knowledge 
that was present between the inhabitants of this universe and that 
extraneous entity was there for an explicit purpose; without that 
membrane they would merge with it, before their time, contaminating that 
field and annihilating themselves. It had sprung from other 
constellations; from living planets, gas giants; from white dwarf 
ring-belets; from the quantum satellites of Singularity; and from many 
divergent nodes." ["The Prisoner Gains a Blurred Skin"]

<p>
<a href="1805.html#1886qlink6">"Transhumanism is a philosophy, an outlook on the malleability of the </a><br>
current "human condition" and the idea that its a good thing to explore 
the possibilities of existence, irregardless of how wild the pathways
are that such thinking leads us. The problem with Sentism is formulating 
a system of precepts that aren't (1) truisms - so broad-based as to be 
irrelevant, or (2) expanding the scope of our discussion to the point 
that we are paralyzed by the sheer volume of issues that present 
themselves.

<p>
I think Transhumanism balances the potentialities of the future with our 
current situation quite well. Within its rubrick we are able to explore 
a variety of issues that have yet to be thoroughly explored. Perhaps, 
once we've explored (and experienced) the events and issues we discuss 
on this list and other fora, we can turn our attentions to the next era, 
whatever it may be."

<p>
Hold on. If it is balanced then it is not venturing "irregardless of how 
wild the pathways are that such thinking leads us." Or is this the 
conservative transhumanist thread for those who only believe in immortal 
superintelligent boxes and eternal virtual realities with romantic 
attachments to Dyson spheres and current business arrangements? For 
<a name="1892qlink1">example, why not work out protocols of 'first contact' with aliens and 
extropes (beings from other universes)? I imagine what we would ask for 
is extra physical space through spacetime manipulation, don't you think? 
I would. This would be my first request.</a> Second request would be 
teleportals to other places in this universe and gates to other 
universes. [Assuming such is possible.] Childish to ask? Perhaps. 
Doubtless these issues have been discussed before. Damien Broderick 
believes all previous post-Escalation/Spike/Singularity 'civilizations' 
have been destroyed by errant superpowerful 12 year olds, an old but 
valid argument. However, given the projected numbers of worlds with such 
events [my estimate was much larger than his for numbers, begins prior 
to his timeframe and has the universe flooding with information in c.5 
million years, but then I only spent three hours going through it and my 
maths is hopeless] it is statistically unlikely that every world is 
destroyed and every nanoprobe breaks down and - ridiculous as this may 
be - in the 'worst case scenario' - that every Bill Gates doesn't end up 
becoming catfood for the Omen part III instead of the Lawnmower Man. 
[Why can't you have a positive transhumanist Lawnmower Man? Hollywood 
accountants and lawyers don't approve.] If the Quarantine argument is 
correct then drawing up a list of requests makes sense. After all, we 
can't 'fight' them. Perhaps they are waiting for us to join them? 
Sentists naturally believe in full civil rights for aliens and extropes 
(extropes presumably having highest-level translator mechanisms to 
enable insertion into our spacetime matrix).

PS if any of you are in Melbourne tonight at the last regular 
Psycorroboree (Coverlid Place, opposite Sadie's, $4/$5 entry) I have 
been invited to give another talk tonight on spiritual matters and the 
Techno-Rapture, at midnight in the chill-out area. Usually there's 60 or 
70 people out of 200 or 300. Also I am in the process of organising a 
Techno benefit in favour of the non-patenting of human and other DNA 
(patenting has not yet been adopted in Europe - for 2 years - and not 
yet in Australia for human DNA). This does not mean companies cannot 
charge for DNA therapies or splicing. It just means that in nanoyear 
nanomanufacturing of therapies and splicing cannot be restrained by 
oligarchies. Drexlerdemocrats rule OK! A democracy of aristocracy. 
Contradictory? On the contrary!
