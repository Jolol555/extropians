<p>
I said this was to be an open discussion, and this is an open mailing
list.  So your students could join the list and then join the discussion.

<p>
My intention in arranging this is to get a deeper critical discussion 
of these issues than we've usually seen.  It was not to create a meet
the author session, nor an educational experience, nor to create a 
bonus benefit to entice people to join the list. 

<p>
So if your students would have been shy about joining in a random 
discussion on this list, being unsure whether they knew enough or could
express themselves, I'd hope they'd be doubly shy about this.  If, 
however, your students never joined before only because they didn't
consider our conversations were up to their standards of clarity and
insight, then I'd be delighted to bask in their brilliance :-).

<p>
I don't know of any list rule against forwarding messages, so you also
have the option of forwarding our singularity discussion to a separate 
class list where your students could discuss things among themselves.
