<a name="0766qlink1">I would add one more data point to "we're in for a cosmological
revolution": the existence of life.

<p>
<a name="0785qlink1">The most plausible model for the origin of life is that it requires
<a name="0789qlink1">10^100+ chemical trials for the right combination of circumstances
to occur.</a></a></a>

<p>
If the universe is a mere 20GY old, that isn't enough time.

<p>
Life -&gt; a much older (or much larger) universe.

<p>
There's an interesting historical precedent:
In the late 1800's, physicists calculated how long the sun would last,
assuming a coal-burning source of energy.  The answers were Usherish,
less than 100KY.  The geologists insisted from rock&amp;sediment evidence
that the minimum age for the earth was more like 100MY.  This anomaly
could have been read as "the sun must run on a more powerful energy
source than coal, or must be renewed somehow".  Eventually, fusion
was discovered, resolving the problem.
