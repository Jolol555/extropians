<p>
I disagree with the notion that reasonable people will typically disagree 
about things that are relatively unknown.  But that's another conversation.

<a href="2650.html#2655qlink2">&gt;&gt; &gt;...  From my perspective, the burden of proof is on you</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;to prove that analogies hold between intelligence and superintelligence; the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;default assumption, for me, is that no analogies hold - the null hypothesis.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; If no analogies hold, then you have no basis for saying anything about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; You can't say it will be fast, slow, purple, sour, or anything else.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You can have a lot of small analogies hold, to things like the laws of physics</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the processing of information in the brain, rather than great big</i><br>
<i>&gt;analogies to entire civilizations.  At that point, you're working with rules</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead of correspondences - with simulations instead of analogies.</i><br>

<p>
Small analogies are fine by me.  But to make an argument of them, you need 
to state them explicitly, and respond to criticism about why these rather than
other small analogies.  

<p>
<a href="2650.html#2655qlink3">&gt;&gt; To me "superintelligent" means "more intelligent", and we have lots of</a><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Big Bang was instantaneous.  Supernovas are very bright.  State-vector</i><br>
<i>&gt;reduction is sudden and discontinuous.  A computer crashing loses all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;memory at once.  ...</i><br>

<p>
Yes there are big sudden events in the universe.  But they are unusual 
enough that you need a concrete argument to convince people a supernova
is likely to hit them soon.

<a name="2668qlink1"><a href="2650.html#2655qlink4">&gt;If the planet was on a collision course with</a><br>
<i>&gt;the Sun, I can see people saying:  "We've seen ice melt, and the deserts are</i><br>
<i>&gt;full of sand, and when things get extremely hot water evaporates, but there's</i><br>
<i>&gt;no reason to suppose that the entire planet will vaporize.  ...</i><br>

<p>
Come on - even an empirical trend line of temperature with time would be 
enough to get everyone's attention.  A simulation of planetary motions based
on well understood physics would be even more persuasive.  Of course big 
things could hit us that we don't understand well enough to forsee, but 
that's hardly an argument for any particular big-change claim.</a>
