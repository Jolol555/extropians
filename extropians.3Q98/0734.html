I'd rather not see transhumanity written up in 2055, with a headline
something like 'Mesopotamia Dried Up -- Transhumanity Too" or "Like the
Romans Patricians, Transhumanity Slept While The SIs Arrived."   It wasn't
a lack of creativity that caused the fall of certain societies, but a lack
of good strategies in dealing with possible future outcomes of
technologies.  (-- an ecological impact plan.)

I've had to deal with the residue of slavery in the South, and getting a
right to vote.  I really can't fathom performing like a "fast minded dog"
serving coffee to a SI.  I'd rather the Si's internal society (of mind)
agents (as an option for a SI profiling) at least delve into my mind agents
and function symbiotically, or at least intuitively.
