You lost me here.

<a name="0909qlink2"><a href="0825.html#0897qlink2">&gt;Robin, the reason I produced the list of motivations and actions was</a><br>

Dan had written: 
<br>
<i>&gt;...</i><br>
<a href="0776.html#0897qlink3">&gt;M: SI wants to maximize its power long-term</a><br>
<i>&gt;A: SI sends replicator probes to in all directions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;M: SI wants to die.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A: SI terminates itself. ...</i><br>

<p>
It seems to me that the motivations of future entities can be predicted
as a combination of
<br>
1) Selection effects.  What motivations would tend to be selected for 
</a><p>
   in a given situation?
<br>
<a name="0909qlink3">2) Legacy motivations.  Descendants of current creatures will likely
<p>
   retain much of their motivations, translated to a new context.

<p>
Wanting to die isn't favored by selection or legacy, except for certain
translation possibilities.   Spatial colonization will be selected for,
and has lots of legacy pushing for it as well.  

<p>
Increases in intelligence allow creatures to anticipate selection effects,
accelerating their effects of creatures who prefer to be selected.
Increases in intelligence also raise the possibilities of creatures 
attempting to integrate their otherwise disparate legacy preferences 
under simpler unifying principles.  Otherwise, I don't see how increases
in intelligence should lead us to expect much change in motivations.</a>
