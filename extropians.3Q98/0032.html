What has not been mentioned is the welfare system is a poverty generating
system. All liberal and conservative approaches are wrong as they reinforce
anti-work behavior patterns. I see this every day even at the University
level and can't comprehend how bad it must be in the K-12 system. Martin
Haberman identified the key issues in his "Unemployment Training" in Phi
Beta Kappan
<br>
(March 1997).

<p>
The key values of the welfare system are:

<p>
it's not your fault

<p>
nowness -- learning by sound byte

<p>
showing up --all you need to do is show up and not be disruptive and you get a B

<p>
teachers are responsible for my success-- if I fail it is your fault

<p>
excuses -- if you have a good excuses you are not responsible

<p>
noncooperation

<p>
lack of respect for others

<p>
belief that authority is always out to get them

<p>
you can 'mess up" as much as you want and will be given another chance

<p>
explain success by luck, chance etc.-- not their own effort

<p>
require RELEVANCE for any thing they do

<p>
lack of purpose

<p>
failure to stay on task

<p>
ignorance of rules is a way to circumvent them

<p>
lack of investment in the school (social) system
