<a href="1513.html#1606qlink1">&gt; boogie woogie: I apologize for calling you "cowardly". Of the </a><br>
<i>&gt; comments I made, I retract that one. It was a response to your </i><br>
<i>&gt; picking on people without naming them, but the fact that you were </i><br>
<i>&gt; using a an email handle instead of your name didn't justify my </i><br>
<i>&gt; comment. </i><br>

<p>
I agree, the 'cowardly' remark was inappropriate. Thank you for 
retracting it.

<p>
&gt; I believe the rest of my comments stand as reasonable and <br>
&gt; correct.<br>

<p>
I'm not so sure about this. Let us revisit your comments:

<a href="1365.html#1606qlink2">&gt; My, you really are giving every sign of being *both* cowardly and </a><br>

<i>&gt; and sniping. </i><br>

<p>
How was I 'nasty'? I made observations. They may not have been becoming 
for some people but that does not mean I was being 'nasty'. 'Nasty' 
gives the idea that I was being mean or offensive. I was neither of 
these things. Please explain why you feel you are 'correct' in saying I 
was 'nasty'.


<p>
<a href="1385.html#1606qlink3">&gt; You don't have the courage to post under your real name.</a><br>

<p>
You've apologized for this remark. Thank you.

<p>
<a href="1365.html#1606qlink4">&gt; And you make false, slanderous comments as if that was an </a><br>
<i>&gt; acceptable thing to do on our list. </i><br>

<p>
I made no false remarks. Please point out which remark I made prior to 
this post that was false and slanderous. It appears with this statement 
that you are the one making false and slanderous remarks.

<p>
<a href="1513.html#1606qlink5">&gt; Now, how about retracting your false and perhaps slanderous claims </a><br>
<i>&gt; about my name?</i><br>

<p>
I guess these are a new set of 'false and slanderous' claims other than 
the ones you refer to in your 8/10/98 posting. The gist of my reference 
to your 'new' name is that you harped on my use of a particular name but 
don't use your own original name. I also pointed out that you don't 
harass Tom Morrow and others for their use of names.

<p>
By 'real name' I meant the name your original name. I was not clear in 
my meaning and I apologize for that lack of clarity. But with that 
definition your real name is not Max More, it is Max O'Connor so I was 
correct. And about 'slanderous' ...  I think you should revisit the 
definition since you are so fond of calling things 'slanderous'. One 
thing that is slanderous is accusing someone else of slander when they 
have not.

<p>
<a name="1626qlink1">I will not retract my observations that you were hypocritical since the 
posting record bears that out. I will not retract my observation that 
you despise people disagreeing with you and employ a double-standard 
when dealing with those people. I will not retract my observation that 
you drove Erik Moeller from this list for just that reason.<a name="1619qlink1"> [[I'd like 
to note that every post Erik Moeller ever made has been deleted from the 
Extropians Mailing List archive including the ones dealing with Erik's 
opinions about ExI as a cult]]</a>
</a>

<p>
I guess censorship is one of the new extropian values in the new 
Extropian Principles.
