<p>
Feh on yourself too and while you're at it beware of this much:

<p>
I have not read Robinson and so don't know why you feel he needs to fill in such
mundane basics that us other real world plodders have to deal with, but as one who
wrote and developed amongst the best J.I.T. (MRP-II) systems in the world during
the 70s &amp; 80s for many companies like General Electric, General Mills, etc., I
regard myself as an expert in these areas which you seek to obfuscate. However,
not only do I now consider money in all its guises to have too many socially
problematic properties but can hardly remember using it even back then for
planning purposes.

<p>
In laying claim to the concept that economics does not ultimately have to revolve
around the simplicities of price as exists in the present day malthusian monetary
systems, I am now actively planning to introduce ubiquitous transaction
automatacapsids which will include subjective valuations and which may be
optionally used instead of money for those that wish so to do. Peoples' right to
transact using these plasticized neural nets will likely continue so long as their
components aren't irreparably destabilized. Scandinavian countries look to be
among the first to adopt these types of analytic network tools and are initially
providing for non authoritarian government behavior as shown in the following
abstract from a colleague of mine who shares these mutual interests in work
science.

<p>
If you subject all government and opposition voices and ideology to a arbitrary
medium such as Ingrid analysis software, governments won't waste resources in time
time wasting confrontation. For example in Scandinavia, governments manage an
extensive social and economic program which results in world beating growth by
subjecting both government and opposition policy to Ingrid style software.

Combining Qualitative Interviews and Repertory Grid-technique in Leadership
Studies

<p>
Introduction and objective. Organizational culture can be viewed as the
construction and deconstruction of mutual meanings. Since actors in asymmetric
power relations have unequal possibilities to influence how reality is defined, it
is of interest to relate organizational culture to power and leadership (1). The
objective of this paper is to describe a combination of methods, which can be used
as an alternative approach to the traditional leadership research. A research area
which has been criticised for being dominated by positivistic and neo-positivistic
assumptions and a concentration on rules and procedures (1).The alternative
research approach, being situational and reflexive, is well suited for revealing
the rationalities, which according to Eriksen (2), are especially important for
the understanding of leadership in public sector organizations.

<p>
Method. Possible advantages are outlined, regarding different combinations of
qualitative interviews and Repertory Grid-technique (4) (5), in order to enable
insight in managers social constructions (3) and personal constructs (4) related
to leadership and organizations. The salient features for these methods are: 1)
Qualitative interviews are used in order to obtain deep and varied descriptions of
phenomena in the organisation from the managers, their interpretation of these
phenomena in relation to the existing structures in the organisation and their
descriptions of their own actions in relation to these interpretations. 2)
Repertory Grid-techniques are used for obtaining either the managers or, which can
be of particular interest when conducting a Grounded Theory study, the researchers
(5) personal constructs.

<p>
Discussion and Conclusions. It is suggested that a combined use of qualitative
interviews and Repertory Grid-techniques (7) might be fruitful in leadership
studies, to enable the formulating of an interpretative, local and
non-authoritarian theory, where qualitative rigor is possible to obtain through an
interpreting, as well as, theoretical awareness and sensitivity.
