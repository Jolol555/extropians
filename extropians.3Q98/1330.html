</pre>
By Joe E. Dees

<p>
Abstract- Tool use and language use evolve though an identical 
succession of developmental structures, and the evolution of text shares 
most of these stages.  Notwithstanding this isomorphism, these three 
successively abstract further and further from the unmediated 
action/perception gestalt contexture from which their form derives.  
Thus each phase of the evolution of textual representation depends upon 
the prior completion of the evolution of a similar phase of language use, 
which in turn depends upon the prior completion of the same phase of the 
evolution of tool use.  This can be observed in child development, and 
archeological and historical evidence suggests that the evolution of 
symbolic capacity in human consciousness pursued the same course.  

<p>
    The Substrate:  Perception, Recursion and Conscious Self-awareness

<p>
Adult higher apes and infants eighteen months old and older 
demonstrate self-awareness as registered in the mirror test (Social 
<a name="2734qlink2">Cognition and the Acquisition of Self,</a> Lewis and Brooks-Gunn, 1979).  
When their noses are daubed with red paint and they are presented with 
themselves in a mirror, they will touch their own noses rather than the 
reflected ones, demonstrating that they recognize that the images are of 
themselves rather than of conspecifics (other apes or children).  Lesser 
apes and infants one year old or younger attend to the reflected noses, 
indicating a lack of self- awareness.  The appearance of self-awareness is 
a result of the internalization, by the infant, of the distinction between 
persons as material yet purposively mobile (responding to their 
entreaties) and physical objects as material and either inert, 
purposelessly mobile, or moved by persons.  This internalization links 
the infant’s awareness – its spatio-temporal sense of a distinct position 
to which perceptions flow and from which actions emerge -- with its 
bodily location, as a unique subjectivity separate from others.  As the 
awareness of others leads the infant to an awareness of self, the 
organism/environment interface is elaborated into the more complex 
schema of self/soma/world/society.
<br>
Why is it that higher apes achieve self-awareness and lesser apes do 
not?  For that matter, why does self-awareness manifest when it does in 
child development, rather than earlier or later?  
I hypothesize that this is when the number of brain cells, combined 
with the degree and structure of complexity of their interconnections, 
passes a Godelian limit.  Kurt Godel proved that any system of sufficient 
complexity could not be both complete and completely true (1931).  The 
reason for this is the emergence of self-reference.  When System A 
achieves a certain complexity, it is capable of generating a selfreferential
 Statement B, which, in effect, asserts that it is not a part of 
System A.  If Statement B is nevertheless included in System A, then it is 
false, and System A cannot be completely true; if, on the other hand, it is 
excluded, then it becomes true, and System A remains incomplete.
When this Godelian limit is breached in the brain, the capacity for 
self-reference emerges in an organism which is already aware; in other 
words, participating in a dynamic interchange of action and perception 
with its environment.  It becomes aware of inhabiting a unique 
perspective, neither identical with nor isolated from its surroundings.  
Perceived information provides the array from which attention, itself an 
action, selects and focuses upon an object, thus directing and refining its 
perception and setting the stage for action upon the object, action which 
itself will result in perceptual change.  See how the feedback loop 
spirals?  When this feedback loop is applied self-referentially (in 
phenomenology, not to the noema but to the noesis), that is, not to the 
perceived and acted upon but to the perceiving and acting of the organism 
itself, self-awareness results.  The two conditions necessary for this are 
the size/complexity quotient of the brain and the conditioning of a both 
physical and social environment.
<br>
That this system is incomplete, that is, open, allows for creative 
action when presented with novel situations rather than having its 
responses to stimuli circumscribed by instinct alone.  Jean Piaget would 
say (The Grasp of Consciousness, 1976) that the moments when habits 
fail are those which impel reflection, a recursion provoking the advent of 
self-awareness, and that self-construction and world-construction are 
isomorphic and correlative processes, evolving from the central 
interface between organism and environment into progressively more 
elaborate polar self- and world- schemas.  It also entails that conscious 
and self-aware beings can be neither completely self-transparent nor 
omniscient; nor can they completely forget either their own existence or 
the world’s.  They can be neither gods nor things; each must be its own 
particular subjectivity, absorbing, through experience, its own memories, 
and using their constituents as building blocks to create its own 
imaginings and to choose towards which of these to strive.

<p>
    (How) Are We Different from Chimps?

<p>
The great apes breach the Godelian limit, but just barely.  While they 
demonstrate self-awareness, it is, at best, at the Piagetian level of 
concrete operations, and most likely remains at the pre-operational level. 
 They hand-modify objects into implements in response to the exigencies 
of a present need, then discard them.  They neither use a tool in the 
manufacture of an implement, nor do they retain the implement once its 
immediate purpose is achieved, much less assemble a toolkit, and they 
rarely combine implements in action.  Their gestures are likewise 
prompted solely by the circumstance in which they occur (Tran Duc 
Thao,<a name="2734qlink3"> Investigations into the Origin of Language and Consciousness,</a> 
1984).  They have a limited vocabulary of mostly instinctually based 
calls, with at best traces of syntax.  While it is true that they can be 
trained to some degree in rudimentary forms of communication, they 
have not been observed to spontaneously create or transmit open-ended 
syntactical systems in the wild.  They invent neither composite 
technology, nor languages composed of arbitrary and mutually defining 
signs, and the creation of text systems is far beyond them.  We may share 
98% of our DNA with apes, but that other 2%  is responsible for 
immense differences.

<p>
    The Genesis and Development of Symbolic Capacity in Children

<p>
Infants engage their world first through the engagement of the 
caregiver and the exploration of their bodily motility.  When they can 
begin to coordinate actions with perceptions (age three to eight months), 
they begin an investigation of the properties of physical objects and their 
ability to affect them (experiments with contingency).  As they learn 
person permanence, self-permanence, object permanence, means-ends 
relationships (rudimentary causality) and the self-other distinction (age 
eight to twelve months), they begin to experience specific emotional 
states and to exhibit imitative behavior.  Between one and two years of 
age, children undergo a rapid linguistic assimilation, a grasp of more 
complex causal chains and the onset of symbolic representation (Lewis 
and Brooks Gunn, op. Cit.).  They speak in single words, then in pairs, 
then with progressively differentiated syntax. (The Language of Children, 
Mathilda Holzman, 1997). Their vocabulary grows from the most 
concrete generic (“cat”, “dog”) into the more integrated general 
<br>
(“animal”) and the more differentiated particular (“Persian”, “Siamese”, <br>
“poodle” “terrier”)(The Modularity of Mind, Jerry Fodor, 1983).  They 
rarely can be taught to begin reading before the age of three, and 
generally not until the age of four or five.  

<p>
    The Evolution of Technology 

<p>
This evolution emerges from the substrate of bodily action, which 
involves the unmediated appropriation of the object.  The second stage 
consists of the use of unmodified implements as a means of imitative 
bodily extension (using a stick to reach, strike or fend off).  Next comes 
the bodily modification of the implement to more efficiently accomplish 
the task.  The succeeding stage, which adds another layer of mediation, is 
the first appearance of a true tool, in which one object (the tool) is used 
to modify another (the implement) for the task, and toolkits may be 
assembled.  At this point, true creativity begins: implements begin to be 
fashioned which perform their designated tasks in manners other than 
imitative extensions of bodily action.  This is the stage where brute 
signification of created  (rather than natural) objects occurs, and their 
meaning is identical with (a mental image of) their use.  There are, 
however, only a finite (and small) number of basic shapes available; these 
are refined into multipurpose tool types (wheel, lever, wedge, spring, 
etc.), where the use of the tool in the particular task is subsumed by a 
conceptually idealized shape which facilitates general applicability.  At 
this point the revolution begins.  The machine principle of technology is 
developed; objects that are useless in isolation and derive their 
significance solely from their use as connectors are combined with these 
tool types into useful composite wholes, which themselves may serve as 
modules in more complex constructions, as long as they obey physical 
constraints.  Now an endless variety of machines may possibly be 
constructed, an unlimited diversity of tasks may potentially be 
performed, and the ranges of action and perception may be extended into 
the micros and the cosmos, although certain standard machine types will 
predominate.  Finally, in the theoretical physical sciences (physics, 
chemistry, etc.), all specific applications are transcended; such abstract 
principles may be instantiated for application to any task.
    
<p>
    The Evolution of Language

<p>
This evolution also emerges from the substrate of bodily action, and 
begins with calls or movements intended to elicit the attention of a 
responsive other.  Next comes the indicative gesture, which directs the 
attention of the other away from the gesturer toward something upon 
which the gesturer wishes the other to focus. This may be seen as arising 
from imitative bodily extension in the absence of an implement; one is 
pointing at that which one would have touched with a stick had one had a 
stick in hand.  This indirect bodily action, directed toward a responsive 
other, constitutes primordial communication.  The third stage involves 
modifying natural vocalization into an imitative representation of an 
absent referent (onomatopoeic words probably have their origin here).  A 
small array of primitive signals may be assembled, but many objects 
make no sound to imitate.  Genuine creativity makes its appearance here; 
the advent of rudimentary but genuine sign systems, where the signs still 
have specific referents, but are no longer constrained to imitate them. 
These are refined into multipurpose signs (number names, primary color 
and shape names, etc.), where the use of a sign to indicate whole, single 
and particular things is subsumed by its employment to represent general 
attributes which have been abstracted from them.  Still, the array of 
possible monosyllabic sounds is inadequate for efficient discourse.  A 
revolution, the phonemic principle of language, is required, where sounds 
that are meaningless in themselves are combined into meaningful wholes, 
some of which are multipurpose signs and some of which derive their 
significance solely from their use as links connecting and relating these 
multipurpose signs in varying ways. These words may be combined into 
sentences obeying syntactic laws that must themselves, to be useful, 
facilitate a reliable representation and communication of the physical 
entities, situations and relations being described.  Now an unlimited 
number of signs may be created, and spun into boundless streams of 
discourse, although certain standardized constructions will predominate.  
Finally, in algebra and symbolic logic, all specific references are 
transcended, and any referent may be abstractly represented.
   
<p>
(6)  The Evolution of Text <br>

<p>
This evolution also emerges from the substrate of bodily action, and 
is initiated by the need to direct attention to others, such as predators, 
prey or conspecifics.  It begins with mimicry, or bodily imitation 
<br>
(representation) of the movements of present or absent others, most <br>
likely paired with indicative gestures to indicate either the other(s) being 
mimicked (if present) or the direction in which the absent other(s) lie(s). 
 Inanimate things (such as landmarks) are much harder to mimic, 
however, and if absent can not be pointed out.   In such cases, the 
mimicry, or subjective bodily representation, would require external 
objectification into the depiction of things and maps (drawing in the dirt 
seems a likely first step).  The picture represents by means of imitation, 
and is intended to evoke in the viewer the mental image of that which it 
depicts, or at least the capacity to recognize the depicted, when one 
encounters it, by means of its depiction’s remembered similarity to it.  In 
the case of maps, the territory as a whole is the represented object.  
These pictures become simplified and standardized into glyphs.  
However, many meanings are not of corporeal entities; they are thus not 
subject to depiction.  The glyphs therefore accumulate secondary 
meanings, which metaphorically refer to these undepictables.  Such a 
glyphic vocabulary is unwieldy, however; the Chinese system has over 
one hundred thousand separate characters, many of which are barely 
distinguishable and easily confused.  The phonetic principle of text 
overcame this difficulty.  A small number of glyphs (an alphabet of 
letters and numerals) which have progressively lost their original 
reference meaning, are used to represent the phonemes of spoken 
language and the basic numbers.  They may thus be efficiently combined 
into textual representations of any word or quantity, by means of 
punctuation (such as: ; ! ? etc.) and arithmetical symbols (+, -, =, etc.), 
which possess purpose solely as differing subspecies of mediations 
between representational groups. 

<p>
(7)  Similarities, Differences and Dependencies<br>

<p>
Technology and language both pass through the stages of direct 
bodily action, mediated bodily action, imitative action, creative action, 
eclipse of particularity by structure, the creation of composites, and 
abstract generalization.  Text evolves from mimicry through depiction of 
types and numbers of objects to the representation of their linguistic 
referents, first as individual glyphs and counting marks, then as 
alphabetical and numeric composites.  Technology involves a physical 
action upon objects; language involves a symbolic reference to anything 
conceivable.  The creation of tools also created meaning not found in 
nature –the tool came to represent its use.  Thus the first signs were 
tools, and technology evolved prior to and was a condition for the 
possibility of language.  Texts are both systems of signs in their own 
right, and tools by means of which we represent the language upon which 
their present form of existence depends.  Text underwent (from its 
divergence as depiction) an independent though structurally similar 
evolution to language - independent due to the differences inherent in 
auditory versus visual media, similar since they were referred by the 
same species of mind to the same world.   Once the phonemic principle 
of language took hold, however, the phonetic principle of text, with some 
exceptions (not all societies are literate), followed. Thereafter, as the 
increasing capabilities of an expanding spoken vocabulary co-opted 
progressively more of the tasks previously requiring depiction, text was 
primarily placed (with certain exceptions, such as maps, mathematics and 
musical notation) in the service of language representation, and graphic 
depiction was increasingly relegated to the realm of art.

<p>
(8)  The Communication of Information in the Pre-linguistic Domain<br>

<p>
Before telling (a kind of saying) became a viable means to 
communicate a knowing, it had to be transmitted by demonstration, or 
showing.  This is the most intimate and concrete mode of 
communication, requiring the spatio-temporal co-presence of the 
shower, the thing shown, the showing of this thing, and those to whom it 
is shown.  In fact, in this mode, the showing and the thing shown are 
only divisible if the latter is a separate physical object (pointing 
something out).  If what is being shown is a doing, such as swimming, or 
a making (which is a kind of doing) such as knapping a handaxe, the 
instrumentality and the expressiveness of the body (or the ‘what to 
do/make’ and the ‘how to do/make’) are seamless.  This knowing is 
transmitted through observation and imitation of the doing or making, and 
immediate feedback is available from the world concerning whether or 
not those shown are gaining the having of the knowledge for themselves 
<br>
(or whether they, too, can make/do).  This knowing would most likely be <br>
best retained by routinizing the sequence of actions involved (Mind over 
<a name="2734qlink4">Machine, Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus, 1986; The Logic of Practice, Pierre 
Bourdieu, 1990), a procedure easily generalizable into ritual.

</a>
<p>
(9)   Linguistic Information Communication<br>

<p>
Once people possessed a common language, a knowing could be 
transmitted by telling, which was more flexible than showing.  The teller, 
the telling and those to whom it was told must still be spatio-temporally 
co-present, but the presence of the thing told is not required.  This frees 
events to be communicated to those absent from their occurrence, but 
permits lying, mistakes, miscommunication and misunderstanding, for 
the feedback from the world required in a showing may be omitted.  One 
can tell another what/how to do or make without doing or making 
oneself; one can only show by one’s own doing or making.  Telling also 
permits the transmission of abstractions such as theories, speculations, 
and ideas, which, lacking physical instantiation, can not be shown.
Unlike showing, telling is a coding of the thing told.  One listens to 
telling not as a showing is observed, as a presentation of an event, but as a 
string of symbols bereft of any spatio-temporality which belongs to that 
told of rather than to its telling. There is no environmental context, no 
gestalt; the knowing received through telling carries no memory.  
Mnemonics such as rhythm, sibilance and rhyme (Goatfoot Milktongue 
Twinbird, 1978, Donald Hall), used to retain the told as it was told, would 
naturally form the basis for early poetic epics.

<p>
    The Advent of Text

<p>
A common written code further abstracts the knowing from any 
particular event.  The writing must of course be co-present with the 
writer, but the presence of neither the written of nor the written to is 
required.  The fluidity of discourse can be frozen like ice on a sheet of 
papyrus, ripped from the lived worlds of both the teller and the told, and 
sent unchanging across space-time to anonymous readers.  Now history 
can be recorded and knowledge accumulated and preserved, freed from 
the vagaries of memory and the passing of masters.  Science begins to 
gleam in the alchemical eye of superstition, music takes the first steps 
from melody to symphony, and from the synthesis of ritual and poetry, 
theatre may be born.  Logo-centric ‘religions of the book’ may supplant 
prehistoric pagan rites and contend with each other, and philosophy may 
begin to probe both their assertions and its own.  						
			   
<p>
(11)  A Recapitulation of Terms<br>

<p>
Being, knowing and having are states; doing, saying and making 
are processes.  Knowing and having are modes of being, and knowing is a 
having of knowledge. Likewise, saying and making are modes of doing, 
and saying is a making of discourse.  There are other dependencies, also; 
one must be (although since life is involved in dynamic 
organism/environment exchange even when at rest, all living being is 
actually a becoming) in order to do, one must know in order to say, and 
one must have in order to make.  Showing, telling and writing may 
involve doing or making, but are essentially forms of saying.  

<p>
(12)  Why Technology Had to Precede Language, and the March of the <br>
Ur-Meme

<p>
The coordinated system of perception and action which humans 
possess took millions of years to develop, and our huge and finely 
articulated brains required constant selective reinforcement from the 
environment in order to evolve.  In this sense, our quick strong bright 
nimbleness is a result of the pre-reproductive demise of a lot of slow 
weak clumsy dumb ancestors.  These are individual skills; those with 
them have a prima facie reproductive advantage over those without them.  
Language, however, is social.  What possible use could it have been for 
the first mutant to have a modest capacity for linguistic expression in the 
absence of interlocutors?  Language facility is simply not a likely 
candidate for gradual evolution in the same manner as hunting and 
gathering skills. It is much more likely that a genetically dominant 
second order mutation in brain systems organization hijacked an already 
elaborated hand-eye coordination system and applied it to the “mouthear
” nexus (Uniquely Human, Philip Lieberman, 1991).  In this way, the 
social benefits could be realized in just a few generations.  Once this 
mutation spread within a group of hunter-gatherers, its members could 
yell for help better and both express and apprehend more subtle 
emotional states – useful skills in a nomadic foraging band.  Being 
informationally rather than biologically based, the machine, phonetic and 
phonemic principles of tools, signs and texts were nevertheless most 
likely extrapolated from the gestalt contexture of action/perception; the 
structures underlining these therefore appear to constitute a 
combinatorial Ur-meme (The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins, 1976).  
Remember the Gaia Hypothesis (James Lovelock, 1979)?  It states that 
the aggregate of terrestrial life tends to regulate its own environment to 
facilitate its own perpetuation.  Now, imagine human minds as, due to the 
evolution of their somatic perceptual structuring of their surroundings, 
already favorably disposed environments in which these principles, 
considered as informational forms of life, take root.  They would need to 
protect their niches and to replicate; the first is accomplished by 
evolving to give the host environment a reason to have them around 
<br>
(much like E. Coli bacteria facilitate digestion) and the second by <br>
evolving ease of infection (transmitting/teaching the principles to 
others).  Once tool-craft got going, tool forms would evolve to give the 
best selective advantage to those possessing them at the same time 
humans would evolve to more quickly and efficiently conceive of and 
produce better and better tools.  Once language piggybacked onto the coopted
 coordination system, it would evolve to be most easily absorbed 
into children’s brains at the same time it would offer a progressively 
greater selective social advantage to those children whose brains were 
most permeable to it (The Symbolic Species, Terrence W. Deacon, 
1997).  The evolutionary imperative is in this case exactly the opposite 
of that of biotic killers such as influenza, measles, and gonorrhea, which 
had to evolve to become less virulent to allow for their transmission 
before the death of the host.  In their case, the more efficient lose the 
competition to those strains which manifest slower or less completely.  
On the contrary, incubation of these informational life forms grants a 
selective reproductive advantage to those infected; the evolutionary 
exigencies therefore gravitate towards more communicable forms with 
faster incubation and more global mental infestation.  Rather than 
virulent, these memes are budding symbionts; like mental mitochondria.  
And so telling is more easily and widely communicable than showing, and 
writing more amenable to distribution than telling.   So far this may seem 
mere speculation, but watch how it dovetails with history.
  Once texts began to be created, they became more desired as the 
literati gained power and influence.  Scholars and scribes seemed to exist 
solely for the task of creating and replicating libraries of texts, which 
seemed to exist solely to employ scribes and train scholars.  Mass 
production of tools and texts has led to corporate culture, labor division 
and assembly lines, which in turn have allowed the construction of mass 
communications systems, and mass transit systems to distribute both the 
codes and their carriers.  These dendritic hybrids of tool, sign and text 
are connecting human ‘neurons’ into a terran brain, communicating our 
codes by means of metacodes.  Not only has the ground of past history 
beneath our feet been excavated by means of our textually informed gaze, 
but the horizon of the future has been dissolved into the present as our 
televisions and telephones abolish space-time through instantaneous 
communication<a name="2734qlink1"> (The Spell of the Sensuous, David Abram,</a> 1996).  And 
we have made countless copies of them all.

<p>
(13)  Staring at a Screen Darkly<br>

<p>
The advent of the Internet recombines the abolition of space-time 
barriers to communication with the constant and instant availability of 
<br>
(potentially) practically all textual knowledge, as computer aided design <br>
and computer assisted manufacture threaten to leave the proletariat with 
little beyond bourgeois leisure and a subsistence stipend.  The underclass 
will be known not as the unwashed, but as the unwired.  With every 
computer terminal a samizdat, governments (and religions) will 
progressively lose their ability to tell the big lies and make them stick 
<br>
(see Zapatista).  Guerilla semioticians will increasingly ‘poach’ the <br>
icons and symbols of governmental, religious and corporate institutions 
and imbue them with different and frequently subversive meanings (The 
Practice of Everyday Life, Michel de Certeau, 1984).  Authority will 
issue not from age, race, gender or status, but from the internal 
consistency, logical cogency, linguistic clarity and external coherence of 
one’s positions.  Spoken and written language forms will continue 
vanishing as quickly as endangered species, as informational selection 
takes its Darwinian toll.  The hegemony of employment over location 
will melt away as more and more jobs can be performed from anywhere 
with power and a telephone line.  Global democracy will supercede 
multiple national sovereignty as humanity’s attachments to borders and 
boundaries will shrink along with their relevance to the lives of an 
increasingly individually sovereign citizenry (as Francis Fukuyama 
foresaw in The End Of History, 1992).   The policy debates now 
occurring within electronic ‘town meetings’ will be settled by cybervotes.
  The Human Genome Project will allow human beings to 
genetically know themselves (Socrates and Hippocrates would be 
pleased) and to re-engineer their codes to remove textual errors 
<br>
(inherited defects).  If they like the result, genocopies (clones) will be <br>
possible, and there is already talk of exploiting the shared binary codes 
of computer language and the double helix to create DNA computers.  
The meme will then have traveled full circle, finding its way back to the 
gene.  In the coming millenium, homo sapiens will be both weavers of 
and woven by, for better or for  worse, the informational warp and 
communicational weft of a co-evolutionary New Web Order.
