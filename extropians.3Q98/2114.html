I understand that this wouldn't work with only two
people, but would the following be (roughly) a
correct way of explaining this idea?

<p>
Two people arguing over who gets a piece of land
in the current economy:


<p>
        A &lt;----- communication ------&gt; B


<p>
Two people arguing over who gets a piece of land
in the post-economy:

        |--------&gt; Neural Net &lt;--------|
        |                              |
        A                              B

</pre>

<a name="2138qlink1">In the second example A and B's communication is
filtered (or moderated) to become a useful part of
the neural net. In the first example the two would
have to come to some sort of agreement. In the
second example the decision making process happens
in the neural net, which is a product of A and B's
interaction. With a larger network of people,
communication between the two would join a neural
net built from the interactions between millions
of people and a far more complex decision making
process would take place.</a>

<p>
I have to say that, from what I understand, I like
the idea. But it's incredibly hard to imagine such
a system being implemented.
