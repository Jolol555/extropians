<p>
<a name="2764qlink1">As you all probably know, the list has been receiving a lot of spam over the last
</a>
<a name="2764qlink2">few months. The spammers are also apparently sending the same messages to
individual list members. I have noticed that almost all of the recent spams have
</a>
<a name="2764qlink3">included email addresses in the text of the message which are on the juno.com
</a>
<a name="2764qlink4">servers. One reason why so many spammers use services like juno is that it is
</a>
<a name="2764qlink5">easy to set up an email account, and juno's email is also free in many areas of
</a>
<a name="2764qlink6">the country, and pretty cheap in others.

<p>
I have contacted juno's 'postmaster' several times in response, but always get
</a>
<a name="2764qlink7">canned automated responses, and there seems to be no actions being taken to limit
</a>
<a name="2764qlink8">spammers from using juno servers. In response to this, I've started taking two
</a>
<a name="2764qlink9">strategies which I suggest others on the list do as well in hopes of finally
</a>
<a name="2764qlink10">getting some sort of respose to remedy the situation. They are based on the idea
</a>
<a name="2764qlink11">that since juno is doing nothing to prevent spammers from using accounts with
</a>
<a name="2764qlink12">them for spamming, that juno is in collusion with spammers who engage in theft of
</a>
<a name="2764qlink13">electronic services (i.e. wasting my time and bandwidth). Considering the volume
</a>
<a name="2764qlink14">of this theft, Juno can fall under the RICO Act statutes.

<p>
<a name="2767qlink1">Strategy 1: Charge fees: As some on the list may know, I charge a $250.00 fee for
</a>
<a name="2764qlink15">processing unsolicited commercial email messages. Every time I receive a spam
</a>
<a name="2764qlink16">which uses a juno account in the body of the message as a response email address,
</a>
<a name="2764qlink17">I send a bill to juno's postmaster for $250.00. Their account balance is now
</a>
<br>
<a name="2764qlink18">$1500.00. I've given them three days to refuse charges on each instance, and 30<br>
</a>
<a name="2764qlink19">days to pay the charges, and will impose a 18.5% finance charge for balances due
</a>
<a name="2764qlink20">over 30 days.
</a>

<p>
<a name="2764qlink21">Strategy 2: I warn juno in each message that they are in violation of RICO Act
</a>
<a name="2764qlink22">statues by colluding with perpetrators of theft of electronic services.
Apparently, there are means of civil redress under the RICO Act, where a person
</a>
<a name="2764qlink23">or persons can sue violators of the RICO Act. I am currently researching what it
</a>
<a name="2764qlink24">would take to file a class action lawsuit against juno.com on these grounds.
</a>
<a name="2764qlink25">Anyone here is welcome to become in volved in this effort. If you are interested
</a>
<a name="2764qlink26">in getting in on this lawsuit, respond to me at: rico-lawsuit@lorrey.com. Please
</a>
<a name="2764qlink27">provide a zip file with text copies of all spam messages you have received
related to juno.com to add to the evidence files.
</a>

<p>
Thanks,
<br>
Mike Lorrey
