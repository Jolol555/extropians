i figure cryonics is a longshot, but better than no shot or a bunch of
empty

soothing promises from the religionists.  suppose one is sick with
emphasema.
<br>
with this curse, one knows exactly what ones last months are to be like.

<p>
quality of life goes to zero, then negative weeks before the last gasp.

<p>
((squick alert:))  is it possible to have one's head transplanted onto
the body of a chimp?  of course one would be quadruplegic, but at
least one could breathe and communicate as dr steven hawking does.

<p>
 would not one's chances of ever being revived be greatly increased if
one were frozen while still alive, and bio-ram undamaged from
persistent lack of oxygen?<a name="1645qlink1">  since the government frowns
on the practice of freezing while alive, why not transplant your
gasping head onto the chimp's body,</a> then almost immediately, before
the immune response starts, freeze the whole thing?  then cut
away the nonhuman parts (scalpel...clamp...buzzsaw... {8^D ) and
you have it.  a frozen head with, presumably, the software still
in there waiting for technology to bring it back to life.

<p>
has the chimp path to cryonics already been explored?  where?

<p>
ps:  i love extropy too, "jenny".   {8^D   spike
