Information AND the system which processes it is the fundamental unit here."

Information theory is not really my field, but the point is that at a
certain level 1) and 2) become identical.</a>  As McLuhan might say, the medium
becomes the message.  Otherwise we again have an infinite regress..the
<br>
"substrate" must itself contain information...but if this is so, then the<br>
substrate requires a substrate, etc etc etc. Your definition is suitable to
the macro world, but falls down if applied to fundamental systems.  Again, a
system that can process information must contain information...but then this
system therefore cannot be fundamental.<a name="0173qlink2">   My own intuition is that the
<a name="0456qlink1">Universe is actually a big lump of instantiated MATH.  The math is not so
much a processing system, but a description of the way information CAN
interact with itself.  A facile analogy is to throw a bunch of cubes into a
box and start shaking it.  Sooner or later the cubes will start lining up.
This is not due to a system "processing" the cubes but simply reflects that
the shape of cubes is such that they can stack neatly in a certain
configuration.</a></a>
