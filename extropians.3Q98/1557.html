&lt;&lt; &gt;Would anyone by any chance know whether this another ripoff (they
<br>
<a href="1486.html#1557qlink1"> &gt;take the $ 27.00 and vanish), or a legit business? If so,</a><br>
<i> &gt;it might be nice money maker for the Americans and Canadians on this</i><br>

     Yea, it would be great to make $700 "just mailing circulars from home".
 These are ripoffs...
 

<OL>
  <li>  If they did it themselves it would be much more efficient with bulk mail
 and high volume processing.
 2)The Post Office Box for address is a dead giveaway.
 

</OL>
<p>
 This is one of the oldest scams and a staple of the conartists in the
 "business oppurtunity" field.
<p>
     But then again, maybe they will pay you all that money just for mailing
 circulars!

I had sent off money for one of these things once, they said theyd give me $1
for each letter i stuffed and mailed out, with their supplies.  I sent the
money and got nothing. $30!  This was a long time ago.  I have the feeling
some things will work and lots of money is possible, such as with the right
multi-level marketing company.  One that keeps its word.  And has a good
success rate.  I had the opportunity of joining one once as it opened, but
didnt have enough money ($300).<a name="1582qlink1">  Turns out EVERY person in the starting made a
lot of money, bummer.  They made their money by promising every person to make
their investment back within 90 days or refund their money, and held up to it,
</a>by contract.<a name="1582qlink2">  This was a legit company, with a building and lawyers and other
things.  Something like that would be wonderful again.
