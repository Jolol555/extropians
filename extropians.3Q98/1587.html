Perhaps that's because they're actually far from obviously impractical
to most of us.

<p>
<i>&gt;Piggybacked winged stages. </i><br>

<p>
AFAIR NASA are currently testing a scramjet vehicle which will be launched 
from an SR-71 at Mach-3; clearly they think it's a practical proposition.

I know of no such vehicle; there are various SSTO designs around, but all
have a significant payload. And hell, Atlas can be made into an expendable
SSTO by replacing the engines. SSTO is no big deal; reusable SSTO is quite
hard, but certainly feasible.

<p>
Ok, you've got me on that one, though SSMEs are amongst the most reliable
engines ever built. However, I don't know of anyone outside the government
or its contractors who would suggest such a thing, simply because of the
refurbishment cost between flights.

<p>
<i>&gt; Mid-flight propellant loading from another vehicle. </i><br>

<p>
Uh, mid-air refuelling is "impractical"? I was under the impression that
it was carried out hundreds or thousands of times every day by the military
forces of the world.

<p>
<i>&gt;SCRAMLACE (liquify oxygen from the air in flight, for use out of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;atmosphere).</i><br>

<p>
Rolls-Royce think it's practical enough that they've been jealously holding 
onto the HOTOL patents.
