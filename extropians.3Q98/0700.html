(list of desirable attributes)

<i>&gt;dialup accounts are typically world-visible, you could participate in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the fun. The worm will not be able to do anything very constructive, </i><br>

<a name="0704qlink1">The bigger, faster, louder is better meme has been around for a long long
time.... If you take a dog, upload it and run it at 10^6 that of realtime,
you have a very fast dog, but it still is a dog. I think we have a lot to
learn before a SI becomes feasible.</a>

<p>
<a name="0704qlink2">I note these days with dour pleasure that the hardware has gotten so much
ahead of the software that most folks like 266 Mhz $1000 Wintel boxes so the
PC more (everything) to run (huger and huger) bloatware trend is less now.</a>

<a name="0733qlink1"><a name="0704qlink3">Someone with better data that I have (John Clark?) might think about how many
machine cycles are equivalent to evolution of human beings from
archaeobacteria,
<br>
as this might provide a clue as to just how fast the hardware must be to
create
</a>
<br>
an SI from evolutionary principles. I sort of doubt it is less than say 10^50
operations....??</a>
