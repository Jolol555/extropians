<a name="1785qlink1">I shamelessly plug my own book, _Nutrients_Catalog_, as a source of
information about nutrients.  Info can be found at
<br>
<a href="0212.html#1777qlink1">&lt;http://www.gate.net/~harv/nutrientscatalog&gt;.</a></a><br>

<p>
The main page has some quotes from various reviewers.  The "Recommended
by..." menu shows Internet references to the book I have found online. 
The "Nutrients Catalog..." menu has excerpts from the book including the
Table of Contents, Preface, How to Use this Book, and a couple of the
small appendices.  The "Available Online..." menu links to online
bookstores that sell the book.

<p>
Disclaimer:  I'm biased because I'm the author.  Take a look at the info
and decide for yourself.  I don't sell books directly, but I get a
kickback if you buy it from Amazon.com, and I get royalties on every
book sold.  Strangely, I get more money for referring customers to
Amazon.com than the publisher pays me for writing the book.

<p>
I intended this book to cover every nutrient known, mistakenly thought,
or falsely claimed to be a nutrient for humans.  I deliberately gave
various doseage recommendations so no one can tell if I personally
believe in megadoses or the RDA's.  I also give alleged benefits as well
as alleged problems with each nutrient.  I am not trying to push people
toward or away from nutrition.  It is a reference book for looking up
data; it is not a readable book or a how-to book.

<p>
Does ExI have a lending library for members?  I would gladly donate a
copy of the book to ExI, or to someone who wants to review it for this
list.  Since this is in response to Hara Ra, you can have first dibs on
a free copy if you want it.
