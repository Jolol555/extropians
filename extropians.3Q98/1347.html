I thought the "monolith contemplating Mondrians
paintings" was inspired, as was the "portrait of
the artist as a small geometric system" (for me
this sums up transhuman art in one sentence).

AFAIK Anders used PoVRay (www.povray.org), I don't
know what you use, but it's likely to be 3D Studio
MAX, Softimage, or AW Maya in the games industry.
PoVRay is a freeware ray tracer without much of an
advanced interface.

<p>
Regardless of their effect on other people, it's
clear that the artist’s intentions were
<br>
transhuman. The images and words (and especially
some of the quotes from list members - harking
back to a time when no one talked about "hot
babes" (and coincidentally I didn't talk at all))
fitted together perfectly.
