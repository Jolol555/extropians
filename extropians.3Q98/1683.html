<a href="1679.html#1683qlink1">&gt;Why not download the "lessons learned" experience directly into your mind</a><br>
<a name="1685qlink1">from the copies mind.  This would remove the need for reading a summary
and/or repeating tasks.</a>

<a name="1693qlink1"><a name="1685qlink2">My thoughts exactly.  Program the copies to self-destruct in 8 (or whatever)</a>
hours<a name="1693qlink2"> and assimilate the information into your consciousness.  In fact,
program thousands of short-lived copies and assimilate their experiences and
you got your own personal singularity going.</a>

<p>
I also have a hard time conceptualizing the notion of an uploaded mind
desiring a vacation.  Would we *need* vacations in that state?  I mean
vacations are basically a two-week reward for spending 50 weeks at something
you don't particularly like to do.  As uploads, aren't we likely to
experience a greater level of work satisfaction?  I mean, how important
would vacations be if you *really* loved your job?</a>
