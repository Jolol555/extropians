Abstract
<br>
  101 outpatients suffering from anxiety of non-psychotic origin (DSM-III-R
  criteria: agoraphobia, specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and
  adjustment disorder with anxiety) were included in a 25-week multicenter
  randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial with WS 1490, a special
  extract of kava-kava. In the main outcome
  criterion, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), there was a significant
  superiority of the test drug starting from week 8 on. WS 1490 was also found
  to be superior with respect to the secondary outcome variables. HAMA
  subscores somatic and psychic anxiety, Clinical Global Impression,
  Self-Report Symptom Inventory-90 Items revised, and Adjective Mood Scale.
  Adverse events were rare and distributed evenly in both groups. These results
  support WS 1490 as a treatment alternative to tricyclic antidepressants and
  benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders, with proven long-term efficacy and none
  of the tolerance problems associated with tricyclics and benzodiazepines.
