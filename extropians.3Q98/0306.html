<p>
Those interested in life-extension should be interested to learn
that health specialists are still quite ignorant about some really
big factors that cause some people to die, and others to live.  

<p>
Sociologists and other social scientists have long studied some 
very strong correlations between social status and health, but 
medical science has been slow to accept that wealth causes health.

<p>
The June 3, 1998 Journal of the American Medical Association leads
with a study that medical researchers consider careful enough to 
command their attention.  An abstract is at:

<a name="0385qlink1">Here are the death rate ratio parameters from their model:

<pre>
Age       25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65-74   75+
            1.0  2.66  3.46  9.30 16.78 40.00
Sex       Male  Female
           1.0     .41
Race      NonBlack Black
               1.0  1.19
Residence Rural Suburban City
           1.0      1.16 1.52
Education 16+yrs 12-15 0 -11
           1.0      .95   .90
Income    30K$+ 10-29K$ &lt;10K$
            1.0   2.14   2.77
Smoking   Never  current former
            1.0     1.26   1.28
Alcohol drinks/mo.  Moderate None Heavy
                         1.0 1.13   .85
Body Mass Normal Underweight Overweight
             1.0        2.03        .94
</pre>
<br>
Physical Activity  Quintiles 
<p>
    5(high)   4    3    2  1(low)
<p>
       1.0 1.46 1.60 2.25  2.91
</a>

<p>
The article and media about it have focused on the income 
parameters, which are indeed striking.  But other parameters 
are also striking.  

<p>
While smoking gets tons of media attention, it only raises 
mortality rates by ~27%.  And being black is only a 19% hit.  
In contrast, living in a city raises mortality by 50%, 
relative to being rural, and being a man raises mortality by 
a factor of 2.5.   Drinking alcohol and being overweight don't
much matter, but physical activity matters for a factor of 3, 
as much as income does.
