Abstract
<br>
  BACKGROUND: A prospective study in non-institutionalised Australian elderly
  60 years and over commenced in Dubbo, NSW in 1988. AIM: To examine clinical
  and socio-demographic predictors of all-causes
  mortality. METHODS: The data were derived from a
  community-based sample comprising 1236 men and 1569 women followed for a
  median period of 62 months. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty five men (19%)
  and 184 women (12%) died, 46% of male and 53% of female deaths respectively
  related to cardiovascular disease. In a proportional hazards model, the
  significant predictors of mortality were:
  older age, being married (relative risk [RR] = 0.71 for men, 0.74 for women),
  current smoking for men (RR = 3.11), taking more than three alcoholic drinks
  per day for men (RR = 0.37), prior coronary heart disease for men (RR =
  1.36), severe hypertension for women (RR = 1.99), use of anti-hypertensive
  medication for men (RR = 1.74), diabetes for men (RR = 1.62), poor-fair
  self-rated health for women (RR = 1.74) and physical disability for men (RR =
  1.72). Serum cholesterol was associated with mortality in a
  'J-shaped' relationship in men and in a reciprocal relationship in women.
  Blood pressure predicted mortality in an incremental fashion
  below 75 years, but in older subjects lower pressure was associated with
  excess mortality. CONCLUSION: Some
<br>
  predictors of mortality in the well elderly
  have been identified and a more extended period of follow-up will possibly
  resolve contradictory findings in some areas.
