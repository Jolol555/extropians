methinks "jenny" is trying to make the point thatextropians are not
doing the world any good.  right?
<br>
we are a bunch of self absorbed navel gazers?  ok,
tell ya what, "jenny", i'll bite on this.  will you let me
off just saying that the ext chatgroup has been a positive
influence on me?  we learn a few things, perhaps from embarrassing
180 degree conversions, such as my own experience
with roton rockets.  its a place that i can toss out some
wild ideas, have people laugh at me, laugh with me, then
propose that perhaps there is something worthwhile there.
thanks extropians...  spike
