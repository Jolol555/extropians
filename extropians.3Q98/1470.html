Interesting point. Personally, I think that the Singularity (=SI) is
probably the most significant threat to those in suspension. Otherwise,
I don't see why sooner or later nanotech wouldn't be sophisticated
enough to perform the repairs, and AIs be smart enough to reconstruct
the original personality with near-perfect accuracy from even a badly
suspended brain (by running a reverse simulation of the damage,
retracing every atom and molecule to its original position). Both
technologies can draw from and improve upon the designs found in nature,
if nothing else. Other issues like keeping the cryonics companies in
business, adjustment to future society, costs of revival etc. are
(almost) insignificant compared to the Singularity problem. 

<p>
Nevetheless, this *doesn't* mean one shouldn't get a cryo-contract.
Maybe revival will be possible *before* the Singularity, or maybe the
technocalypse will turn out to be a benevolent one. In any case, it's
better to be safe than sorry, which in this case means freezing the
bodies of the deceased. In the worst case you've just bought some peace
of mind. So, IMO there's *no* rational argument against cryonics, not
even in its crudest form (straight freezing).
