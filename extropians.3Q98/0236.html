Its actually a libertarian joke. The other side of the joke is that a Democrat
is merely a Republican who has been laid off....  The two phrases are meant to
communicate that Dems and Repubs are just two sides of the same political party,
the pro-government-as-the-solution party. Fortunately, more and more libertarian
ideas are seeping into the less demagogic members of both parties. Watching
which libertarian ideas seep into which party is pretty interesting, and may
lead to a real difference in parties once again.
