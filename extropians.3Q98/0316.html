<a name="0335qlink1"><a href="0296.html#0316qlink1">&gt;I am wondering if any members of the list are on the Life Extension</a><br>
<i>&gt;Foundations Protocol, and if so, what you think</a> of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I recently received their 1998 directory of life extension</i><br>
<i>&gt;nutrients and drugs, and am impressed enough to consider switching</i><br>
<i>&gt;to their products/protocol.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In many ways it is very similiar to the protocol I have been using,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which was developed independantly.</i><br>

<p>
I've been on their protocol for over 10 years, after having bought
supplements from various sources for almost 20 years prior. From the
standpoint of product selection, quality and price, I can't say enough good
things about them.

<p>
Another benefit is the Foundation plows a good portion of their revenues
into life extension research.

<p>
Management also riskedpersonal jail sentences and spent a fortune in
fighting the FDA over supplement availability, promotion, consumer rights
etc., while other vitamin companies sat on the sidelines and profited from
the Foundation's efforts and success.

<p>
Lots of good reasons to use their products.

P.S. I was under more stress this past year than anytime in my life and
didn't even get a cold.
