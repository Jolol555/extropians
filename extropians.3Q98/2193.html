<i>&gt;</i><br>

David Friedman is discussing questions like these in a book that he's
writing, called _Why Is Law?_.  Interesting stuff.  He's webbing the
chapters as he's writing them; you might want to take a look at:

<p>
Under the "Why Is Law?" link.

<p>
In this particular case, placing all of the liability on the buyer gives
the buyer a great incentive not to do something stupid (like taking LSD and
holding marbles in one's mouth), but perhaps not infinitely great.  If the
buyer's desire to do such a silly thing outweighed the value the buyer
placed on his/her own life, then the buyer *should* have taken LSD and
marbles together.  Since we imagine that the buyer is in the best (if not
the perfect) position to evaluate the value of his/her own life, it would
be most efficient to place all liability on the buyer, which should
maximize economic value in this case.

<p>
In contrast, by placing liability on the seller, the *seller* must
determine whether or not it would be worthwhile to sell the LSD/marbles.
Since the seller's only criterion is profits, the seller must try to guess
how valuable the court will guess the buyer's life is, and use this guess
to renegotiate his/her prices.  The very act of introducing a court in this
case results in inefficiency; the fallibility of the court's evaluation of
the buyer's life results in situations when the seller will set his price
inefficiently high or inefficiently low.

<p>
This is not an argument for universal "caveat emptor," but reflects the
advantages of caveat emptor in this case.
