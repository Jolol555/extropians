I can't help but feel that such usage may enable a rather insidious form of
'meme propogation' and authoritarianism to take place: those who disagree
but do not wish to distinguish themselves are likely to be led towards a
belief that they alone hold their views, against society as a whole and, if
the 'we' is spoken by one in authority, against the leaders of the
established order. They may adopt beliefs simply to become one of the 'we',
rather than remain one of the 'them'. 'We' thus becomes prescriptive,
rather than merely descriptive.

However, I'm not sure this a point worthy of resolution through debate on
this list: it's merely an observation on my part. Besides, it does little,
if not nothing, to diminish Robin's arguments which are, as they always
are, enviably intelligent, well-informed and lucid.
