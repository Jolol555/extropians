Abstract
<br>
  Metabolic fates of pyruvate (CO2, lactate, citrate) in normal and neoplastic
  cells have been assessed. Pyruvate consumption by tumour cells falls (by
  72-85%) and mean percentage oxidation rises from 75% to 91% with
  hydroxycitrate. Ratios of rates of oxidation of
<br>
  (3-(14)C-pyruvate) : (1-(14)C-pyruvate), indicating CO2 produced from TCA<br>
  cycle activity : that from PDH activity, are higher for tumorigenic
<br>
  (0.17-0.24) than for non-tumorigenic (0.005-0.04) cells and increase<br>
  (0.27-0.65 and 0.13-0.29, respectively) with hydroxycitrate.<br>
  Although maximal ATP-citrate lyase activities do not correlate with
  malignancy, citrate may be a major fate of glutaminolytic pyruvate in tumour
  cells. Citrate accounts for 14-37% of consumed glutamine compared with 11-13%
  being recovered as CO2. By contrast, approximately 100% of glycolytic
  pyruvate is converted to lactate.
