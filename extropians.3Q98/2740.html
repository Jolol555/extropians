Having as you do a sense about how both worlds think, you have a good
opportunity to distill the essense of one mindset and explain it to
the other.  I for one am very curious to understand exactly what they
mean by science sticking its nose where it doesn't belong.</a>

<a href="2711.html#2740qlink2">&gt;Gary Snyder's essay in his book _A Place In Space_ ... "The Porous World":</a><br>
<i>&gt;"When asked 'What is finally over the top of all the information chains?'</i><br>

<a name="2754qlink2">It is striking to me how artists, who appear to others as tending to 
lambast the inequities in our world and the tragic losses from competition,
revel in competition in their own world.  They might write plays about 
what terrible things come from someone setting themselves as Gods compared
to others, but those who do this well become writer-Gods whorshiped by 
their minions, and seem quite comfortable with this arrangement.</a>
