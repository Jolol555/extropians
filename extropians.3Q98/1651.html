<a name="1670qlink5">In the above I wrote: " The original only has to take the

two weeks vacation."  So after each vacation I would take the time to
read the lessons learned.  Every now and then, I might read something
in the "lessons learned" that I would want to repeat myself....</a> wait a
minute, I did do this myself.  I mean, I would want to repeat
something that I would want the experience of to remain in my memory,
so I would also do that work before returning to vacation.  The whole
point here is that there will be creative options for eliminating
mundane work required by an expert.  The non-mundane work is still
required to remain as a past subjective experience.
