Even by that standard, then, they've overreached in deducing causation.
Neither the family communication-usage nor depression-usage correlations
changed significantly from pre to post, although loneliness</a> probably 
did.

<a name="2042qlink2">Also, the *change* in psychological state is contemporaneous with
internet use, and so with respect to that as a causative factor, they
don't have temporal control.  If *losing* friends makes people turn
to the internet (as opposed to not having them in the first place)
then you get the reported results, even with the reverse of the inferred
causation.</a>

<p>
Oops, my bad.
