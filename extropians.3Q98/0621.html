<i>&gt;Your assuming that all rats passing along the gay gene are themselves</i><br>

<i>&gt;their parents, even though they were passed genetically from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;parents.</i><br>

<p>
If I remember correctly, the topic was rats having evolved a trait that
causes them to turn gay when overpopulation sets in.  So at some point in
time there is a hero rat who, due to a mysterious mutant strain in his
makeup, turns gay to save the colony from their population crises.  Which
effort fails miserably (see #1 above).  This heroic rat then, for his
second act, refrains from having any descendants to carry on his heroic
tradition....

<p>
<a name="0647qlink2">I think it's fair to say that if this trait offers no reproductive
advantage in this scenario, it didn't evolve in this scenario, or *for this
purpose*.</a>

<p>
<a href="0613.html#0621qlink3">&gt;&gt; In humans, the "gay gene" exists in an equilibrium with those of other</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; sexual stratedgies, increasing its share in small societies where the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; increased disease risk that this strategy brings is not a large factor,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; decreasing when the opposite is true.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If there is a "gay gene", I'm not sure why you think it would be more</i><br>

<i>&gt;there are any gay-specific diseases.  HIV is too recent to be proposed</i><br>

<i>&gt;nongays, I would expect a gay-preferring disease to have little effect</i><br>
<i>&gt;on genetics.</i><br>

<p>
To take your last statement first, people with the "gay gene" have
historically reproduced just as often as people without it, else this gene
would have declined and vanished from the gene pool.

<p>
By trying to "fit in" to societies that expected men to marry and have
children, gays did indeed father children--as often as straights.  Which
<a name="0647qlink3">explains why disease was a limiting factor for this trait: since gays were
having sex with other men as well as with women, they had more sex partners
than straight males, hence they suffered disproportionately from STD's.</a>

<p>
It is supposed that the "having more sex partners" is also the reproductive
advantage offered by this gene, as possessors of it tend to gain more and
earlier sexual experience than those who lack it, which is much appreciated
by the girlies....
