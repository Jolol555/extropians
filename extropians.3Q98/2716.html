I would amend that to say that most proponents of progress are not fondly
revised by present day historians. Since most present day historians are of
the luddite/crunchy/left persuasion, they obviously are applying their biases
</a>
to what they write about individuals who were prophets of progress. For
example, the Industrial Revolution, a period which saw the greatest growth in
wealth, health, and education of the largest percentage of the general
population in history, is seen today as a time of backwardness, disease,
exploitation of the working classes, etc.

I think that the time of the kook is upon us. Since it is now generally cool
to be a computer geek, at least among the younger generation (the old school
media are still stuck in the 50's "nerd" attitude rut),<a name="2736qlink1"> I can imagine that the
