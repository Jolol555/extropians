   Sorry if this isn't timely.

<a name="0644qlink1">     There is no such thing as a "gay gene". Homosexuality is not 
genetic, but environmental.</a> The Study previously refereed to in this 
thread was done of women who were at Dresden during the bombing, and 
were pregnant. Their male offspring were homosexual at at rate of 80% in 
stead of the societal average of 10%.<a name="0644qlink2"> Homosexuality is caused by the 
underproduction or overproduction of a certain hormone in the mother 
during the gestation of the fetus (I believe in the third trimester).</a> It 
has been documented that regulating this hormone in rats can create 
butch or effeminate homosexual rats, as well as straight ones. It should 
be noted that this applies to male rats only, there was no correlation 
found for female rats. All of this information can be obtained in the 
Discovery Channel's special called "Brain Sex". I belive these studies 
are referenced and explained in the third hour of the documentary.
