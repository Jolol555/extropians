<p>
Maybe primitive today but my involvement with this software is my unique ticket
into uploading land. I'm just waiting for hardware to catch up with my own unique
view of how to develop a massively parallel version. If you can't see the Ingrid
software's potential to transform into a full blown brain, well that's not my
problem.

I'm sorry I can't help you see the usefulness of my view of how and why AI should

"this" is my view of how and why AI should be implemented at the global level.

<p>
<a name="2091qlink11"><a href="2057.html#2070qlink6">&gt; What exactly do you mean by a "qualitative statistical mediator?"  What's a</a><br>
<i>&gt; "super ordinate construction?"</i><br>

<p>
"super ordinate constructions" is another term for "core constructs" from the
specialty field of Personal Construct Psychology where the Ingrid software was
</a>
<a name="2091qlink13"><a name="2091qlink12">developed. See George Kelly's theories. I foresee grids (neurons) dynamically
</a>
activating the levels of knowledge extracted according to Kelly's theories.
Qualitative or synthetic data includes such independent componentry that make it
</a>
<a name="2091qlink14">applicable to this imagery type of processing. I would hope that an open structure
</a>
<a name="2091qlink15">would allow enough variables to be processed that the contributors of the data
</a>
<a name="2091qlink16">would trust the inferences displayed. Therefore a "qualitative statistical
mediator" is a software system capable of say presenting solutions to large
problems. I wouldn't be surprised if such a tool was used to design the Northern
</a>
<a name="2091qlink17">Ireland peace proposal. (I know for example that Tony Blair was greatly influenced
</a>
by Kelly's work.)

<p>
<a name="2091qlink18"><a href="2057.html#2070qlink7">&gt; In short, super-AI will read everything, know everything we can know,</a><br>
<i>&gt; process all the information, and deal with it accordingly.  Yes?</i><br>

<p>
To what point in the life cycle of the AI does your irrelevant question refer.

<p>
<a href="2057.html#2070qlink8">&gt; Here again you lose me.  How will super-intelligences get a self image?</a><br>
<i>&gt; Where did common sense come in here?  Why should we hope that it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; "reflect human effectiveness?"  What sort of daunting realities will remain</i><br>
<i>&gt; as unconscious elements in a super-intelligent mind?</i><br>

<p>
There are classified records of many failed experiments locked away. Read
"Ellsberg on secrecy" to get an idea of the sort of daunting realities that I
referred to. Please understand that my concepts for a global AI based neuronomy
are only possible if all records are available for knowledge extraction and
integration. It is after all only my hope for a hypothetical possibility of a
specific future implementation of AI and it isn't a certainty. To get a handle on
what constitutes the psychiatric term "ideal self image" you need to know that
it's like something that happens to young animals when getting their first
glimpses of their parents.

<p>
<a href="2057.html#2070qlink9">&gt; Right, now, let me clear something up.  Would humans in this case be</a><br>
<i>&gt; external to the AI, or synaptic-like-units which comprise the AI?</i><br>

<p>
I'd prefer that humans continually contribute to the AI's synaptic weights along
as humans are around. Wouldn't you?

<p>

<i>&gt; which you have only intimated?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And for that matter, how are needs and wants "undertaken" in the first place?</i><br>

<p>
As a preference I would like to see this tech be as unobtrusive as possible as
regards needed transactions or undertakings - does the tech in the novel about the
Aristoi do this? Wants may operate using other structures but don't pin me to what
these subtleties should be as I don't know and nor could anyone ever address the
situation until it was modeled or in operation.

<p>
<a href="2057.html#2070qlink11">&gt; &gt;The present economic drivers may/will still be active but there</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;will also be so many more all using the same forms of abstraction and</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;hard to get at bionomic and personal areas that the methods of reporting</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the motivation for doing so will be so unlike what restricted capitalism</i><br>
<i>&gt; offers, so much so,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that the means of transactional measurement should at least for clarity's</i><br>

<i>&gt; Economic drivers?  You mean things that drive the economy, like needs and</i><br>

<i>&gt; (do you really mean ecological?) and personal areas?  How do you report a</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2057.html#2070qlink12">&gt; &gt;Don't forget that no land area on earth is presently exempt from the</a><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As a point of interest, this is a terrible abuse of the term</i><br>

Yes that was a bad term. I meant that money was in use across the totality of the
earth's surface so much so that it crowds out any discussion of an alternative.
But remember even an ice age can end.

<a name="2091qlink25"><a href="2057.html#2070qlink13">&gt; Here, lets try a thought experiment.  Suppose you've got a two person</a><br>
<i>&gt; economy, Alice and Bob.  Alice has an apple which she happens to value less</i><br>
<i>&gt; than Bob values the apple.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, in capitalism, Bob will pay Alice for the apple, thus maximizing value</i><br>
<i>&gt; and resulting in economic efficiency in the Marshallian sense.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; process is scalable to all kinds of economic activity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, suppose Alice and Bob had chosen to reject capitalism and instead</i><br>

<i>&gt; would it work?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
When thinking about a neuronomy it might be easier to consider that it couldn't

<a name="2091qlink27">economy where no element was independent. Furthermore it would have come into
