While I absolutely respect Kathryn's right to reveal only that which she 
chooses about her personal thoughts and experiences in this forum, I can't 
help but be alarmed at the implied accusation in the above statement. 

<p>
I'm particularly confused and intrigued by this: "...the environment for 
those of us not based in California is not supportive to women of my 
demographics..."

<p>
Since you are (more or less) calling for action by ExI here, it would be
very helpful to know just what events led to your leaving ExI, and what kind 
of action you'd like to see.

<p>
Thanks very much for any information you care to add.
