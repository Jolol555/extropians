 I totally agree with that view. The image of the horizon is just the
right thing: everybody is on the verge of a singularity, we're
constantly walking toward it! And there might not be just one horizon,
but a continuity of them, in every domain of humanity's knowledge or
ability.

<p>
  To think there will be a change, any sort of change, be it
philosophical, economical, social, technical...etc, to the very
history of mankind, a change that is actually the end of history,
looks very much like a doom theory. Well, it could/will look like it
to a lot of people. Me included? Certainly, if I or my offsprings
(genetically or not) are not part of it, and/or if it happens very
quickly/violently.

<p>
   When was the last time when the end of history was announced? Karl
Marx. (note: I don't want to imply that communism is linked in anyway
with the singularity, just want to draw an analogy)

<p>
    Manu.
