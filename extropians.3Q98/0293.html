<a href="0252.html#0293qlink1">&gt; Tidal forces would be a real problem.  The gravitational force that</a><br>

<p>
<a name="0319qlink1">	I think this makes sense.  Is this saying that even if the
point of equilibrium (where centrifugal force precisely equals
gravitational force) were in the center of your body, the inside of
your body (that which is facing towards the black whole) would be
enough closer to the black whole as to experience much more gravity,
and the outer part of your body (that which is away from the black
whole from this point) is far enough away from this point that it
would rip you apart?  Is that kind of what "Tidal forces" are or are
they different entirely?</a>
