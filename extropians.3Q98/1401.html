<p>
This was mentioned a few threads ago..


<p>
A interesting survey would be how Extropians/Transhumanist relate to their
work, their work environment, and what field they pursue.

<p>
I tend to get 'dug in' to a project and spend all hours going gangbusters
on something to get it to a certain stage. Working on a shockwave app right
now that has a few deadlines soon - but I like what I do! Getting 45
minutes of sleep isn't so horrible if it's inspiring.

<p>
Perhaps people have already conveyed this data.

<p>
I work in heavily technology, tons. Part of my job is creative, I have a
fine arts degree and freelance.

You are armed with tremendous patience.
