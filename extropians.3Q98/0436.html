Title
<br>
  Reduction of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis by CDC-flaxseed with very
  low alpha-linolenic acid.

Abstract
<br>
  Flaxseed (Type I flaxseed) with 51-55% alpha-linolenic acid in its oil and
  richest source of plant lignans, has been shown to reduce
  hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis by 46% without lowering serum lipids.
  Antiatherogenic activity was claimed to be due to its alpha-linolenic acid
  and/or lignan content. If alpha-linolenic acid component of flaxseed is
  responsible for antiatherogenic activity, then, CDC-flaxseed (Type II
  flaxseed) which has similar oil and lignan content but has very little (2-3%
  of the total oil) alpha-linolenic acid would have no antiatherogenic effect.
  An investigation, therefore, was made of Type II flaxseed on high cholesterol
  diet-induced atherosclerosis and serum lipids [total cholesterol (TC),
  triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
  (VLDL-C)] in rabbits. Rabbits were assigned to four groups: Group I, Control;
  Group II, Type II flaxseed diet (7.5 g/kg orally daily); Group III, 1%
  cholesterol diet; Group IV, 1% cholesterol diet supplemented with Type II
  flaxseed (7.5 g/kg orally daily). Blood samples were collected before (0
  time) and after 4 and 8 weeks of experimental diets for measurement of serum
  lipids. Aorta was removed at the end of 8 weeks for assessment of
  atherosclerotic plaques. Serum TC, LDL-C, TC/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C were
  lower in Group IV as compared to Group III by 14 and 31%, 17 and 32%, 28 and
  34% and 24 and 32%, respectively, at 4 and 8 weeks. HDL-C was not affected by
  Type II flaxseed in hypercholesterolemic rabbit. TG and VLDL-C were markedly
  increased in Group IV as compared to Group III. Type II flaxseed reduced the
  development of atherosclerosis by 69%. Histological changes in the
  atherosclerotic regions were qualitatively similar in Groups III and IV.
  Results indicate that reduction in hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis by
  Type II flaxseed is due to a decrease in serum TC and LDL-C. In conclusion,
  antiatherogenic activity of Type II flaxseed is not due to alpha-linolenic
  acid.

  Dietary flax seed in prevention of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis.

Abstract
<br>
  Oxygen free radicals (OFRs) have been implicated in the development of
  hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis. Flax seed is the richest source of
  omega-3 fatty acid and lignans. omega-3 Fatty acid suppresses the production
  of interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and leukotriene B4
  (LTB4), and of OFRs by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and monocytes.
  Lignans possess anti-platelet activating factor (PAF) activity and are
  antioxidant. PAF, IL-1, TNF and LTB4 are known to stimulate PMNLs to produce
  OFRs. Flaxseed would, therefore, reduce the levels of OFRs and hence would
  prevent the development of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis. The effects
  of dietary flax seed on a high cholesterol diet induced atherosclerosis,
  lipid profile and OFR-producing activity of PMNLs (PMNL-CL) were investigated
  in rabbits. The rabbits were divided into 4 groups: group I, control; group
  II, flax seed diet (7.5 g/kg daily, orally); group III, 1% cholesterol diet;
  and group IV, same as group III but received flax seed (7.5 g/kg daily,
  orally). Blood samples were collected before and after 4 and 8 weeks on their
  respective diets for biochemical measurements and aortae were removed at the
  end of 8 weeks for estimation of atherosclerotic changes. The high
  cholesterol diet increased the serum level of total cholesterol (TC) and
  PMNL-CL without altering the levels of serum triglycerides (TG). These
  changes were associated with a marked development of atherosclerosis in the
  aorta. Flax seed reduced the development of aortic atherosclerosis by 46% and
  reduced the PMNL-CL without significantly lowering the serum cholesterol.
  Flax seed in normocholesterolemic rabbits increased serum total cholesterol
  and decreased PMNL-CL without significantly affecting the serum TG. Modest
  dietary flax seed supplementation is effective in reducing
  hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis markedly without lowering serum
  cholesterol. Its effectiveness against hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis
  could be due to suppression of enhanced production of OFRs by PMNLs in
  hypercholesterolemia. Dietary flax seed supplementation could, therefore,
  prevent hypercholesterolemia-related heart attack and strokes.
