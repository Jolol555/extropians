I don't have enough data to be sure that this is the case.  Let's assume 
you're right, for the sake of argument.  Then a reasonable 
statistical hypothesis would seem to be that Western women, at this point 
in history, have damn good reasons to be interested in gender issues -- 
because policies on those issues are in a state of flux, which may, if 
<a name="0745qlink1">handled right, give those women greater opportunity to increase</a> their 
extropy.

<p>
On what basis do you draw that conclusion?  In fact, could you explain 
what you mean, there;  what does "relevantly overpresented" mean? Do you 
mean "relatively over-represented"?</a>

<p>
<a name="0745qlink3"><a href="0707.html#0728qlink3">&gt; and is this of any (more) relevance to the list than the permanent </a><br>

<p>
Well, of course it's relevant to the list.  Discrimination</a> on the 
<a name="0745qlink4">basis of gender or sexuality (or anything else) which results in people 
being "kept down" _unfairly_ certainly minimizes their extropy.</a>  I'll 
<a name="0745qlink5">agree that the gun debate is rather beside-the-point, though.</a>
