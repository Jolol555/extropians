<p>
Yes, I did misunderstand this.  I thought you meant a twisted pair of
wires, like speaker wire or a telephone wire, where there were two wires
in one casing.

<p>
I think double thickness of wire would still be one copy.  The size or
mass of the circuitry is not an issue for me.  The number of independent
programs that can run unchanged after the other ceases determined the
number of "individuals".

<p>
I do understand your view, and I do understand what you are trying to do
with your series of examples.  This converstation is interesting to me,
because someday I may have to make a decision based on this very
question.
