Very well, but I very much doubt there will be a choice even on the
short run. If Darwin still holds, the fitter newcomers sooner or later 
will come to compete for the resources. From the point of view of
these new fast, sleek beasts on the block, these atoms wasted on the 
planetary core for 1 g habitat, the ecosystem to maintain you, and 
even the utilization efficiency on the atoms in your body must seem
quite a waste.
