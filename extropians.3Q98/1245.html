Yeah, just did. So he's essentially absorbed the old Delta Clipper team and
popped an autogyro on top and included his centrifugally fed engine
technology, but divorced it from the rotor (which to me was the most iffy
part of his original design anyways). So he still saves on fuel pump weight
and complexity, and reduced the flight regieme of the rotors so they won't be
as tought to build and maintain,<a name="1332qlink1"> and he is saving big bucks by absorbing all
the R&amp;D work that went into the Delta Clipper airframe, fuel tanks, cargo
bay, and of course C^3I.
