While I did not say this, I will support the accuracy of this prediction. While
vegans/animal rightists as individuals may not perform such shallow and
obviosly manipulative and untrue attacks, I know from personal experience that
activists and political action groups (on both sides of the spectrum) do not
care how much they lie or distort the truth, so long as they can curry public
sentiment in favor of the policies they are trying to shove down people's
throats.

<a name="1167qlink3">Unfortunately, your ad hominem attack is inaccurate in truth.</a> The company I
<a name="1167qlink4">work for processes mailing lists for several of these</a> activist organizations,
<a name="1167qlink5">and I can tell you that the female members outnumber male members</a> by a ratio of
<a name="1167qlink6">at least 4 to 1. Those are the facts, not 'arrogant sexist bullshit'</a> as you
claim. Likewize, I can also make the claim that most Physical Therapists are
female, by a factor of at least 9 to 1, based on my knowledge of the mailing
lists of several Physical Therapy professional organizations.

<p>
<a name="1167qlink7">You have not made any opposing statements with any facts to support</a> your claim,
