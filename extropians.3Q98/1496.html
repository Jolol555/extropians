<a href="1462.html#1496qlink1">&gt;&gt; Say you knew that all intelligence was either bio or </a><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; from thousands to billions of years.  Then you expect that conditional on </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; being a bio intel, you are typical, so bio intel shouldn't last much more than </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a few decades more (assuming continued exponential growth).  And conditional </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; on being a postbio intel, you know you must be one of the very first</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why? If being a postbio intel is all you conditionalize on, this </i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't follow. If I knew nothing except that I was a postbio intel, </i><br>
<i>&gt;I wouldn't expect to be one of the very first; I would expect to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;one of the middle 95%.</i><br>

<p>
I meant that since I am a bio now, the only way I could be a postbio as 
well is if I am one of the transitionary people who is both at different 
times in their lives.  And transitionary postbios are the first postbios.

<p>
<a href="1462.html#1496qlink2">&gt;&gt; And without introducing more info, you couldn't say much about </a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; your chances of being postbio vs. bio intel.  </i><br>

<a name="1521qlink1"><i>&gt;If postbio and bio intelligences all belong to the same reference </i><br>
<i>&gt;class (just as tall people and short people, black and white etc.) </i><br>
<i>&gt;then the fact that you find yourself being a bio intel. would </i><br>
<i>&gt;indicate that the postbios don't vastly outnumber the bios.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Whether postbios and bios should be in the same reference class is </i><br>
<i>&gt;not clear. That's a deep problem, and I suspect but am not yet </i><br>
<i>&gt;certain that there might be some kind of loophole for the </i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanist here, if the postbios are fundamentally different from </i><br>
<i>&gt;bios.</i><br>

<p>
I reread Leslies book on this issue last night, and object to
putting bios and postbios into the same ref class in exactly the way 
that Leslie envisions one might object:  

<p>
   It might perhaps be complained that making the reference class into 
   humans-after-splitting-away-from-Neanderthals would be coming too
   near to imitating the man who makes his reference class into 
   people-born-as-late-as-himself-or-later [p. 261, The End of the World]

<a href="1462.html#1496qlink3">&gt;... Of course, the exact conclusion depends on how you estimate </a><br>
<i>&gt;future population figures etc., but in general I see the DA as, so </i><br>
<i>&gt;to speak, *superimposed* on whatever other evidence you might have.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1521qlink2">If you do a Bayesian analysis of all your information carefully, the DA 
effect will be embodied in your analysis, and should not need to be added 
</a>in seperately.  

<p>
<a name="1521qlink3">I'm now reading your paper on the DA, and hope to write a summary
of my opinions on DA soon.</a>
