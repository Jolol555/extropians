<p>
  IAN: I should address J. Maxwell's apparent attempt 
  at a logical argument. First I will attempt to make 
  it: It seems that his argument is that because there
  is a system of numbers that does not include zero, 
  that which is derived from a system with zero is 
  not to be taken seriously. That is an argument
  against the entire system of modern mathematics.</a>

<p>
  The fact that primitive societies had number systems
  that did not count higher than 3 is hardly reason to 
  reject mathematical conclusions over 3.  I for one 
  believe that the system of complex numbers, of which 
  the reals are a proper subset, is the  most accurate 
  logical system for mapping the structure of reality.

<p>
  Maxwell is, on the other hand, free to believe that 
  "Egyptian mirror mathematics" is a  more  reliable 
  system; I would only hope that he could at least 
  attempt to formulate a case for why that is so. 

<p>
  A better candidate for a zeroless number system might 
  be the Alternative Number System (ANS), about which I 
  posted here some months ago. Despite my initial glowing
  review of the ANS, further study clearly reveals why 
  it is inferior to the current system of positional 
  numeration, and thereby why zero is the single most
  important number in our Hindu system of numeration.

             The Utility and Value of Zero

<p>
  " [T]he Indian sunya [zero] was destined to become 
   the turning point in a development without which 
    the progress of modern science, or commerce is 
<pre>
     inconceivable. ... In the history of culture, 
      the invention of zero will always stand out 
        as one of the greatest single achieve-
              ments of the human race." 

                    Tobias Dantzig
           "Number, The Language of Science"
                 Macmillan Press, 1967


             Zero: Gateway To Enlightenment

      "He who contemplates on sunya...is absorbed 
       into space. . . think on the Great Void un-
       ceasingly. The Great Void, whose beginning 
       is void, whose middle is void, [and] whose 
       end is void...By contemplating continually 
        on this, one obtains success [nirvana]."

            The Siva Samhita (5:47,160,161)
