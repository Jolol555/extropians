The study showed that an increase in depression was associated with 
an increase in internet use.  However, at least according to the information 
posted, there is no evidence on the direction of causality.  If becoming 
more depressed made participants use the internet more the results 
would be exactly as recorded.  I'd be mighty surprised if they had 
evidence on causality - it's very difficult to obtain that from any study 
without a experimental (as opposed to observational) design.
