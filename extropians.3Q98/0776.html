<i>&gt; </i><br>
You are correct that my statement is clearly false. I can assign any probability
I choose in the range 0 to 1 inclusive. What I meant was that I can think of
no reasonable way to defend any particular choice. Hmm, where did I put
my articulator? I know it's around here somewhere .... Ahh, yes. Ahem:

<p>
<a name="0778qlink2">Since the SI will be vastly more intelligent than humans, IMO we may not
be able to comprehend its motivations, much less predict them. The SI will
be so smart that its actions are constrained only by the laws of physics,
and it will choose a course of action based on its motivations.
</a>

<p>
Can we examine a set of feasible scenarios? (i.e. scenarios not prohibited
by the laws of physics?) Of course. But we can't enumerate them all, and
we can't IMO even rationally select a methodology with which to weigh them
against each other.

<p>
Let's look at a range of possible motivations and actions:
M=motivation, A-action.

<p>
M: SI wants to maximize its intelligence quickly
A: SI restructures the mass of the solar system into a computer

<p>
M: SI wants to maximize intellectual diversity
A: SI force-uploads everybody and starts GP on copies.

<p>
<a name="0897qlink3">M: SI wants to maximize its power long-term
A: SI sends replicator probes to in all directions.

<p>
M: SI wants to die.
<br>
A: SI terminates itself.
</a>

<p>
M: SI decides SIs are a BAD THING.
<br>
A: SI terminates self and humanity.

<p>
M: SI wants to see the end of the universe ASAP(having read both
<p>
   Douglas Adams and Tipler).
<br>
A: SI accelerates self (self equals all mass in solar system?)
<p>
   at high continuous accel to enhance time dilation.

<p>
M: SI decides humanity is wonderful as it is.
A: SI goes covert, suppresses all other SIs and research leading to them.

<p>
OK, how do I assign probabilities to the motivations, and how do I
assign probabilities that a listed action follows from the motivation?

and the relationships between them applicable to an SI?
