Agency to oversee genetic engineering proposed

BOSTON (July 8, 1998 8:39 p.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nandotimes.com">http://www.nandotimes.com</a>) - An ethicist
has
<br>
called for a U.S. government agency to oversee human experimentation involving
genetic engineering as the debate over human cloning raged in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine. 

<p>
Boston University's George Annas, a physician, argued in an opinion column
that
<br>
human experiments involving clones, embryos, genetic engineering and organ
transplants from animals should not be allowed without such an agency's
approval. 

<p>
"Any such national regulatory agency must be composed almost exclusively of<br>
nonresearchers and nonphysicians so it can reflect public values," Annas
said. 
<br>
The agency must be convinced that the research does not threaten
individuals or
<br>
"call deeply held social values into question. This shift in the burden of<br>
proof is critical if society is to have an influence over science," Annas
said.


<p>
But University of Texas School of Law Professor John Robertson countered that
cloning may offer important options to infertile couples or obtaining
tissue or
<br>
organs for transplants. 

<p>
Robertson wrote that the permanent ban on all cloning being considered by
Congress "is also unjustified." 

<p>
"Rather than seek to prohibit all uses of human cloning, we should focus our<br>
attention on ensuring that cloning is done well," Robertson said. 

<p>
The debate over cloning continues around the world. 

<p>
A measure to prohibit human cloning was making its way through the Israel's
Knesset (Parliament). 

<p>
And in Japan, scientists at the Ishikawa Prefectural Livestock Research Center
reported they succeeded in producing two calves which are exactly similar to
adult cows. 
<br>
The cow that gave birth Sunday to the cloned twin calves died several days
later. 

<p>
The twin calves were born exactly two years after Dolly, the British sheep
that
<br>
made history by becoming the first clone of an adult animal. 

<p>
Last month, the company that helped bring Dolly into the world was granted the
license for use of the cloning technology pioneered by Edinburgh's Roslin
Institute. 

<p>
PPL Therapeutics, in conjunction with the Roslin Institute, produced Dolly and
Polly, the first cloned transgenic sheep.
