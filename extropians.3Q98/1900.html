<p>
Which of course is 100% infeasible until you have extremely advanced
nanotech making us effectively autotrophic, space-living and able to
peacefully relocate all parasites (guess how many bacteria your own
immune system is killing each second?). Somehow this sounds rather
silly, especially since we don't mind other animals killing other
animals. It is better to look at here-and-now or near future
</a>
possibilities instead (for example, what about growing meat
artificially?).

<p>

<p>
Has anybody really proposed that? At least here on the list the
consensus seems to be the reverse, that new technologies should be
made as available as possible through efficient means. I have noted
that worries about this kind of restriction crop up more among people
who are not part of the transhumanist discussions; they seem to be
based on a fairly limited understanding of economics and politics.

<p>
<a href="1886.html#1900qlink3">&gt; Perhaps what you need is a Transhumanist Bill of Rights that is simple </a><br>

<p>
A good idea, in fact. Transhumanism do suffer from misunderstandings
in the public, and this may be a way to amend that. The transhumanist
principles may be a first step.
