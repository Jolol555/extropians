FAQs ? Frequently Asked Questions about Transhumanism:
<hr>
<br>
Most of the questions listed below (except the first one) were posed and
articulated by Nick Bostrom of the London School of Economics.  If you have
any additional questions you would like to suggest, please e-mail them to
me.  Contributions of responses are noted parenthetically after the
responses.  An FTT denotes a response from this web site.

<p>
How does Transhumanism relate to Futurism?
Transhumanism is a vision of the future based on many reasonable forecasts
of current trends.  Many futurists, such as my self, tend to adopt a
Transhumanist perspective and philosophy as they study the possible,
probable and desirable alternative futures of humanity.  Transhumanism is a
position within Futurism. (FTT)

<p>
What is Transhumanism?
<br>
Transhumanism is a type of humanism related to secular humanism.  It is a
philosophy of science which seeks to enhance the human (Homo sapiens)
condition by biological and technological enhancements into a post-human
<br>
(Homo excelsior) status.  Using genetic, cybernetic and<br>
psychopharmacological  approaches, we can speciate into something better.
<br>
<i>(FTT)</i><br>

<p>
Transhumanists are also, on the whole, humanists. As humanists, we believe
that humans should be allowed to develop their full human capacities and
that we should apply rational methods to improve the human condition rather
than expecting that some deity will do the job for us. From humanism we also
inherit, I think, the idea that divisions based on race, nationality,
religion etc. are secondary and that primarily we are humans and should
strive to cooperate internationally for peace and prosperity. Tolerance,
freedom of thought and speech, human rights, believing in the importance of
both art and science, and the ideal of "one world" are other core humanist
values that Transhumanists share. (Nick Bostrom)
The accelerating pace of technological development and scientific
understanding of the human animal is creating the possibility of a whole new
stage in the history of the human race.  In the very near future we will
face the prospect of such technologies as real artificial intelligence, new
kinds of cognitive tools that combine artificial intelligence with new
interface technology, powerful new molecular biological engineering and
non-biological molecular nanotechnology.  The consequences of these
developments will include the prospect of meaningful augmentation of the
human being in fundamental ways.  Realistic possibilities flowing from these
developments include significant increases in human mental and physical
power and vastly extended life spans.  They also include the possibility of
great harm to human life as we know it.  Even though these are extreme
possibilities, they are taken seriously by an increasing number of
scientists and scientifically literate philosophers and social thinkers.
<br>
(Greg Burch)<br>

<p>
What is a post-human?
<br>
A post-human is the species that comes after humans much like we came after
chimpanzees.  The difference is that our successors in evolution will be
intelligently designed by ourselves, the Transhumans.  This new process,
presently underway in its initial steps, is often called participant
evolution or co-evolution. (FTT)
<br>
Post-humans could be completely synthetic or they could be the result of
extending a biological human's capacities with many partial augmentations.
In either case, a post-human would be a "higher" life-form than humans, in
the same sense as a human could be said to be higher than an ape. More
specifically, this means that a post-human may have a greatly expanded
intellect and memory; an indefinite life-span; the ability to choose its own
mental states and emotions. Also exosomatic ("outside-the-body")
improvements count, such as rapid access to databases or networks containing
huge landscapes of ideas and information; high-bandwidth communication links
with other post-humans (almost like a computing network); and advanced
manufacturing technologies for building physical structures.
Most Transhumanists think it is impossible to fully imagine what post-humans
would do or what it would be like be a post-human -- just as non-human
primates cannot begin to fathom the complexity of human affairs.

<p>
Why do you want to live longer?
<br>
I love life and I see life itself as intrinsically meaningful.  In short,
the meaning of life is life itself.  Additionally, humans are far too
myopic, shortsighted.  With the dramatically increased control we humans
have over nature greater foresight is needed as we plan out future.  Only
those with a personal investment in the long range future of the species and
the planet can effectively oversee its resource management.   Thirdly,
bigger and better accomplishments that humans can only recently
realistically achieve will require the long term talents of great minds.
Such plans as domed Moon cities, aquanautic cities at the bottom of the
Ocean, terraforming Mars and possibly Venus, floating L5 cities, the genomic
sequencing of all major organisms, the astrocartography of the known
Universe, the final mapping of subatomic structure and a final grand unified
theory of physics,  propulsion systems development for interplanetary and
interstellar travel all will require dedication that will span centuries.
Only people with such a prospect and such long-term energy and commitment
will be able and necessarily motivated to accomplish such goals. (FTT)

<p>
Isn't death part of the natural order of things?
Humans are part of nature broadly defined.  It is our nature to modify our
environment for our better survival and prosperity.  All animals try to so
modify their environment by storing food, building nests, burrowing holes or
simply grassing food, etc.  Earthquakes, tornadoes, disease, predation,
starvation and death are all natural.  Nature is not essentially good or bad
but is morally neutral.  Human reason must decide what is good and what is
bad based on their survival and prosperity needs. (FTT)

<p>
Won't extended life spans cause overpopulation problems?
Human populations will continue to grow regardless.  What longer lifetimes
will allow for is the longer-term projects such as the populating of new
lands (nova terra) for the expansion of human (and post-human) populations
<br>
<i>(FTT)</i><br>

<p>
Won't new technologies only benefit the rich and powerful? What happens to
the rest?
<br>
Innovations always benefits the entire society in which they arrive.
Whether it is cars, radio, TV, computers, refrigerators, microwave ovens,
the telephone or whatever only in the beginning are these "toys" or
"luxuries" available to the affluent.  Over an increasingly shorter amount
of time, mass production techniques, increased demand and more efficient
manufacturing techniques to meet the higher demand increase supply.
According to the basic Law of Supply and Demand in economics, the higher
supply lowers prices as is shown very well in the computer industry.  A
capitalist economy is essential for the competition necessary to most
efficiently supply the demand.  History demonstrates this continually as in
the examples given above. (FTT)

<p>
What kind of society would post-humans live in?
Post-humans will likely live in a technologically advanced, democratic,
capitalistic society where personal freedoms are respected.  In short a
society similar to that in the industrialized, information-based societies
typical of the United States, Europe, Japan and many other such countries
around the world. (FTT)

<p>
<a name="0929qlink1">Are Transhumanist technologies environmentally sound?
Transhumanist technologies have the potential to preserve existing
ecosystems. Reasonable non-Transhuman extrapolations of existing human
culture have little chance of reserving the current ecosystem. (Dan
Clemmensen)</a>

<p>
Isn't Transhumanism tampering with nature?
"Tampering with nature" either means modifying our environment which is
natural for us and all other animals as stated earlier.  As far as
self-modification, this process has been going on since medical men and
women have tried to heal sick people.  The disease of aging may be natural
but so is our evolutionary instinct to counter it in favor of our own
survival. (FTT)

<p>
Transhumanists reject a bright line between "man" and "nature": From its
beginnings, the development of our species has been a process of positive
feedback with our technology, broadly defined as those created tools we use
that are not part of our simple genetically endowed physical structure or
behavioral repertoire. From the time of the simplest stone tools and most
primitive linguistic constructs, humanity has been engaged in extending its
capacities through the use of increasingly powerful "artificial" tools.
Thus, "tampering with nature" is the very thing that makes us human.
Transhumanists simply seek to continue that process -- wisely -- onto a new
level of sophistication. (Greg Burch)

<p>
Won't Transhuman technologies make us inhuman?
Transhuman technologies in environmental and self modification will improve
our condition so that we may become something better.  We as humans (Homo
sapiens) will become post-humans (Homo excelsior?) much as Homo habilis and
Homo erectus before us. (FTT)

<p>
Do you believe in God?
<br>
Beliefs in anything should be based on evidence.  As a metaphysical
assumption, conventional monotheism is beyond evidence and cannot be proven
or disproved. Such a deity is supposed to exist prior to and be creator of
the Universe and thus is outside of the Universe.  As such nothing in the
Universe can provide evidence for that which exists outside of it.  Since
the existence of such a monotheistic deity is unknowable even in principle
an agnostic position is more reasonable  than either a theistic or atheistic
position.  Efforts at the improving and transforming of the human condition
based on factual evaluation of evidence will be far more fruitful than empty
debate about this historically contentious and often culturally-bound
metaphysical question. (FTT)

<p>
So you think technology will solve all problems?
Science and the technologies can  solve material questions only based on the
study of physics, chemistry, biology and related natural sciences.  Cultural
problems of misunderstandings among ethnic/subcultural groups within a
society or the intercultural disputes between societies can be remedied or
improved by empathy and the social sciences. (FTT)

<p>
Shouldn't we concentrate on current problems like improving the condition of
the poor people or solving international conflicts instead of putting effort
into foreseeing the "far" future?
<br>
The natural sciences can best address the longer-range problems of the human
condition.  The social sciences can help address the other problems combined
with the direct efforts of relief agencies which should continue.  In short
both endeavors are very important for humanity's future in the short and
long term. (FTT)

<p>
What evidence is there that it will happen?
Many trends and successes suggest that continued genetic and cybernetic
enhancements are possible.  The artificial heart, bionic or artificial
limbs, organ transplantation between humans and the initial successes in
trans-species xenotransplantation suggest both the technological and
biological approaches are working.  Gene therapy successes are very direct
evidence that increased genetic enhancement of humans will also continue
especially through the recently invented human artificial chromosome (HAC)
which can safely deliver corrected or beneficial genes to every cell of the
body. (FTT)

<p>
There is a non-physical soul and therefore some Transhumanist issues are
bound to fail (uploading, conscious, AI).
Studies of neural damage in neurosurgery wards throughout the world suggest
that all functions of the human "spirit" or mind are localized within the
brain.  Even the general mental activities of the mind have been mapped to
very specific regions of the brain's neuroanatomy.  Neurophysiologists have
shown that thought and memory are electrochemical in nature and have
detailed much about exactly how this happens.  Though the brain is extremely
complex, given enough time in terms of many decades or at lest centuries,
enough knowledge is likely to accumulate to allow for the successful
transfer of biological awareness to a similar noncarbon substrate such as
silicon and the self-awareness of advanced parallel processing computers as
well.  Eventually though Artificially Intelligent (AI) computers may be some
of us or our descendant post-humans. (FTT)

<p>
What is nanotechnology?
<br>
Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter at the atomic and molecular
level.  In the future molecular manufacturing by self replicating robots
making houses, space ships, etc. is often cited as the goal of
nanotechnology.  Current research  in nanotechnology though seems to focus
on applications of it  in quantum supercomputing  with microscopic CPUs,
memory chips and possibly microscopic nanomachines to make cellular repairs
in medicine. Such things as the Gene Chip from Affymetrix and the Bucky
Balls (C60) are often considered current discoveries credited to
nanotechnological studies. (FTT)

<p>
What is the Singularity?
<br>
The Singularity is a concept borrowed from astrophysics and applied to
participant evolution.  The Singularity is  when our current concepts and
definitions of "life", "consciousness", "intelligence", etc. which we apply
to our selves and our surroundings will no longer be valid.  For example, a
conscientious computer as in Artificial Intelligence (AI) would make our
standard definition of consciousness, intelligence and life difficult to
explain.  Especially if this aware computer can copy itself (as we do
software today) and thus replicate and even modify its own programs then
this is replication and "genetic" variation and thus Artificial Life (AL).
Similarly, as we augment out own intelligence with psychopharmaceuticals,
neurotrophic factors etc. we will likely have an experience of awareness and
intelligence and even of life that is difficult and probably impossible to
predict or even describe.  As in the Event Horizon at the edge of a Black
Hole, what we know breaks down.  A Black Hole is caused by a Singularity and
thus dramatic changes from a human to a post-human will be analogous to such
a Singularity. (FTT)

<p>
These new technologies will be used in war and may cause our extinction.
That such nanotechnologies are and will continue to be developed is a given.
That we need to monitor and direct that development to avoid malevolent uses
of technology should be equally compelling. (FTT)

<p>
How will superintelligent machines treat us humans?
We expect that such machines will behave in the same rational, ethical
manner that their inventors/creators do. (FTT)

<p>
All these Transhumanist issues will not happen within a hundred years. They
will take more like a thousand years. (MNT &lt;molecular nanotechnology&gt;,
Uploading)
<br>
The time-scales of developments in science and technology are getting
shorter not longer.  Though the exact chronology of future events is not
known, the forecasting, monitoring and directing of those events to reach
the soonest and best possible outcome is the primary emphasis in
Transhumanism. (FTT)

<p>
What if it doesn't work?
<br>
Transhumanist trends are already working as examples above illustrate. (FTT)
Is Transhumanism a cult/religion?

<p>
Transhumanism is a philosophy of science NOT a religion.  "Cults" (as
defined by sociologists) are religious sects that show blind obedience to a
single authority and eschew connections with the outside world .  Religion
and philosophy take different routes to satisfy the drive for meaning in
life.  Transhumanist philosophy (as any complete philosophy) can replace the
need for religion in one's life. (FTT)

<p>
What makes Transhumanism different from other philosophies, movements or
religions?
<br>
Transhumanism weds theory with action, the abstract with the concrete.  As a
philosophy of science it is both speculative as philosophy and
self-correcting as science.  Unlike previous philosophies and religions in
human history, it has a very concrete and realistic yet bold, ideal and
futuristic vision for the next stage in human biological evolution on Earth
in our solar system today and tomorrow. (FTT)

<p>
Isn't Transhumanism old hat? Sure, it's a new name, but basically, hasn't
the philosophy been around a long time?
<br>
Transhumanist longings and yearnings for a better existence and to improve
upon what he or she finds in life are as old as the human condition.  The
concrete and detailed goals and plans of where to go and how to get there
are rather new in human history.  Accordingly, the name Transhumanism has
only recently arrived in the English language.  It might not yet have even
made it into the Oxford English Dictionary but at lest will in time. (FTT)

<p>
What prominent thinkers are associated with Transhumanism? (This is not the
same as "Who is prominent within Transhumanism?")
John Brockman who founded the Edge Foundation and the Reality Club and
authored The Third Culture is associated with Transhumanism.   Many if not
all of the people in his anthology also are. Several books such as Last
Flesh: Life in the Transhuman Era and Create/Recreate also give insight into
this.  Certainly K. Eric Drexler inventor of the idea of nanotechnology and
founde of the Foresight Institute is also.  The list is very long and  will
be added to as time passes. (FTT)

<p>
Oh well... (Person sort of agrees in an intellectual way but doesn't take it
to heart)
<br>
The transition to a Transhumanist way of seeing the world is sometimes slow.
I recommend reading a Transhumanist book and joining either the
Transhumanist or Extropy mailing list to get better acquainted with the
theory and practice of Transhumanism as a way of life and living. (FTT)

<p>
How could I become a post-human?
<br>
Participation in Transhumanist activities is the best way to become
post-human.  Possible actions include: joining Transhumanist mailing lists,
reading related books, joining and participating in societies such as the
World Transhumanist Association and the Extropy Institute, attending annual
meetings of such societies such as TransVision and EXTRO.
Because the circumstances of life are unpredictable, to increase the
likelihood that you become a post-human I also suggest the following:
Changing your life insurance policy to include coverage or at least $100,000
<br>
(which is standard), the beneficiary of the policy to a cryonics company<br>
such as Alcor Life Extension Foundation, Cryonics Institute, CryoCare or
Trans Time, signing up for such a service to make the "anatomical donation"
of your self available to them, setting up a trust fund possibly for your
re-entry and letting any  family and/or  friends that you trust know of your
intentions. (FTT)

<p>
The possibility of success (in cryonics) is too small.
The chances are constantly improving as cryobiologists continue their
research as efforts such as the Prometheus Project promote the application
of such research to mainstream clinical application of cryonics procedures
and techniques.  Certainly, the healthier you stay and the longer you live
the better your chances become. However, those chances in participation in
post-humanity are vastly greater than zero.  Zero chances results when you
simply give up, die and decompose. (FTT)

<p>
Will the people of the future be interested in restoring you?
Your family, friends and descendants will be interested in reviving you.
Others who might know you through stories carried down from your family and
friends will also.  Keeping a diary/log book or a video history of your
self, your life and that of your friends would act as an external time
capsule or archive of your extend memory over time.  Genealogical research
may also give you and your descendants a greater sense of connectedness to
you.  Not only will these things increase their interest in reviving you,
they will give you more friends once you do re-enter the sentient state.
<br>

<p>
What recent progress has been made towards Transhumanist goals?
Many advances in cloning, body transplantation, organ generation, gene
therapy, cryobiology, neuroscience, neurosurgical imaging, nanoscale
computing,  etc. show trends in the Transhumanist direction. (FTT)

<p>
What kinds or Transhumanist transformations might occur? How can these be
understood in relation to our current species?  (What is a possible
taxonomic structure?)
<br>
[Note: much of the context of this question and its response came from Doug
Bailey and Alan Grimes. The exact wording is from FTT.]
Our current species Homo sapiens is likely to be transformed first
genetically by gene therapy (as has occurred a few times in
clinical/experimental trials).  As long as such creatures can procreate and
interbreed with humans, the central criterion of speciation, these creatures
remain Homo sapiens although they may qualify as a subspecies Homo sapiens
excelsior.  Once human artificial chromosomes (HAC) are used to introduce
entire suites of genetic programming the likely effect is to make
interbreeding difficult or impossible.  At this point according to taxonomic
rules, the organism is a new species, Homo excelsior.  Cybernetic
enhancements, if they do not interface directly with the organism in a
essential way could be Homo cyberneticus.  Those that incorporate Silicon
chips into their brain as coprocessors or encyclopedic memory chips would be
Homo biocyberneticus.  Because both genetic (excelsior) and cybernetic
<br>
(cyberneticus) improvements can co-exist, a taxonomic classification<br>
priority system would need to be implemented to distinguish between species
and subspecies.  Since taxonomy is done by biologists not cyberneticists
excelsior would likely be given prior species status if both occurred in the
same organism e.g. Homo excelsior biocyberneticus.  As far as the genetic
enhancement of other species, it seems that the same classification system
would apply first sapiens to denote sentience then excelsior to denote
genetic improvements and then cyberneticus or biocyberneticus if such
implements were added.  The genus would remain the same.  If massively
parallel supercomputers are deemed intelligent and sentient they would
constitute a separate genus, Cyberus, and possibly a new kingdom Silica and
phylum, class and order as well.  Again Cyberus sapiens would be the
starting point.  After that, the speciation epithets become more murky
because of the limits of the Singularity.  It seems that a completely
uploaded humanoid creature (of the genus Homo) that had an entirely
nonorganic body would belong to the new genus Cyberus.
