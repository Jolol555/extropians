Indeed; government is by its nature very unstable, and that's another good
reason for abolishing it.

Really? How much does a train or bus ticket cost these days?

Fine; you can think what you like, but reality doesn't give</a> a damn about
"should" or "should not". If they wish they're free to stay there and 
die in defence of their beliefs, but they'll die just the same.

<p>
Again, the question isn't what you think, but whether you want to live or
to die because you refuse to accept reality. Up to you.

<p>

<p>
Who's running from the problem? Those who stay behind because they "shouldn't"
have to move, or those who move because they recognize that it's the only
solution? Politics will only make the problem worse, not better. And you 
don't "allow it to exist"; it exists, whether you like it or not.

<p>
<a href="0090.html#0283qlink6">&gt;  To concentrate on reducing the motivational force for terrorism</a><br>

<p>
Of course; much better to increase that motivation and stand behind your
beliefs that people shouldn't have to get nuked for it. They'll be real
happy up in the stratosphere.

<p>
<a href="0090.html#0283qlink7">&gt;I don't think that we need</a><br>

<p>
Uh-huh... and that won't destroy privacy? Being subjected to arbitrary
searches and scans by the cops, which will very quickly be expanded to
include anything else they can scan for? And what will you do when the
freedom fighters take that as an incentive to strike now?

<p>

<a href="0090.html#0283qlink8">&gt;thought that optimism was an integral part of the Extropian Ethic.  Am I</a><br>

<p>
Not your kind of "if we just ignore reality it will go away" optimism.
