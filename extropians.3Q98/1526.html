<i>&gt;black humor.Ironically the Techno-Rapture is the expression of Gaian fruition,</a></a> </i><br>
despite
<br>
the temporary side-effect of mass extinctions (similar to previous ones 
from
<br>
solar body strikes). Not only is it the mechanism for boosting of living
beings (and extinct ones) in the post-Escalation period (the 
post-species
<br>
period) but science itself is an integral part of the process. At some 
levels
<br>
our minds are the cortex of Gaia. Without more complex species and the
Techno-Rapture, changes in the Sun would destroy planetary life in only 
500
<br>
million years, approximately one eighth of the present age of the Earth. 
I
<br>
personally believe the Gaian process is only a precursor to a wider 
universal
<br>
process in which thought itself infuses universal structures and
environmental manipulation becomes an aspect of self-direction. All very 
old
<br>
hat and typically Extropian. However, the debate is about directions and
mechanisms and degrees of inclusion. Perhaps it is limiting to think in 
terms
<br>
of only one answer, or the concept of answers. Perhaps some of us will 
leave
<br>
for the stars, some for other universes and some will manipulate 
spacetime
<br>
locally. Some may adhere to flesh, some may not, some may do both - 
after
<br>
all, why stop with one body? I believe the real issues are more ones of 
rules
<br>
of consent and inclusion of choice. I see choice itself as the ultimate
boundary condition of the multiverse. That's why I know myself to be 
Rather
<br>
Simplistic. Avatar Polymorph, way@warehouse.net, August 29 after
