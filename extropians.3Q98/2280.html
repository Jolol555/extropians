I think this may have been my(unjustified) problem with it-- it sounded
too much like a pop-psych book.  I think I prefer a more philisophical
writing style, but this is most likely not representative of your average
Joe or Jane.

Maybe this could be a general policy?  Putting up the progression of all
the papers you write (especially the principles!) would be a good way of
demonstrating the progression and dynamism of extropic thought.   I think
it would be also good lesson in "learning from your mistakes" and in the
the ways a memetic system must evolve to survive in rapidly changing
times.

<p>
A quick comment about the nomenclature of "Dynamic Optimism" -- although
there a quite a few people on this list who think the name does not stress
rational/critical thought, I have never encountered this objection outside
of the extropian population.  I think these objections are simply an
overcompensation for the rare public perception of Extropy as a cult.  I
see nothing wrong with the name; on the contrary, I am particularly fond
of the word "dynamic" and I think you are explicit enough about critical
thought in your paper about PCR.
