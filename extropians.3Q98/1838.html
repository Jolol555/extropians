Dear Friends,

<p>
As mentioned some months ago 2 members
<br>
of Transcedo (Arjen Kamphuis &amp; Me) will be
travelling trough the USA from the 7th of Sep.
untill the 27th of Sep.

<p>
We would like to meet as many of you as possible.

<p>
===&gt; THANKS !!! to all the people who invited us,
we were very pleased with all your positive
reactions. But (sigh) we had to make a plan and
unfortunatly skip some places. We hope we 
will see you an other time.

<p>
This is our draft-plan at the moment:

<pre>
 7th  -- arival JFK ---  NYC
 8th -- 10th   DC
 10th -- 13th  Houston
 13th -- 17th  Phoenix
 17th --  21th LA
 21th --  25th SFO   plane Back to NYC
 27th --  Back to Amsterdam

</pre>
<p>
We will travel by Amtrak (as much as possible
 by night.....)

<p>
 I would like to ask all of you (with this plan 
 in the back of your mind) to send your 
 invitation again !!
<br>
 and let us know if we have a place to sleep.
 and if you can pick us up from a Train Station.
<br>
 ----&gt; Please don't worry if your plans have <br>
<pre>
         changed for this period during the last moths
         we understand and it's NO problem !!
<br>
 ----&gt; Please don't feel obligated to find a place<br>
         to sleep for us.  We will arange Hotels.
-----&gt;Please don't feel obligated to arrange transport
         from the Train Station. We will take a bus or a Cab
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Just let us know if you would like to spend some
         time with us while we are there, and we will try to
         squeeze it in our travel plans.

</pre>
<p>
THANKS AGAIN...whatever the outcome of the various
 offers may be.......

<p>
Greetings,
