Ok, I'll try to summarize my position too.

<p>
The doomsday argument is a one application among many others of the 
anthropic principle. The DA, as I understand it, does not show that 
doom is likely to strike soon. What the DA does is place 
interesting constraints on what views of the future and of the 
universe at large are tenable. To assume an impending doomsday is one 
way of taking account of the DA, but at least at our present level of 
understanding there seem to be alternative interpretations, some of 
which may (hopefully) fit with the transhumanist vision of the 
future. Further analysis is required before we can say anything more 
specific than that.

<p>
<a name="2014qlink1">I think Robins' position can be characterized as follows: He accepts 
what I call the self-indication axiom (SIA) and he thinks that also 
non-observers should be included in the reference class.</a>

<p>
As for the SIA, I think it is consistent to accept it. There are 
problems - the problem with infinities and the no coincidence 
argument - that I think seriously detract from the plausibility of 
the SIA. But these counterarguments are inconclusive, and I do not 
rule out the possibility that the SIA should be accepted. The 
difference between Robin and me here seem to be one of degree of 
belief or disbelief in the SIA.

<p>
Robin's view that we should include non-observers in the reference 
class, on the other hand, seems incoherent to me. I have raised 
several objections against this, including the 
who's-the-apple-and-who's-the-pear problem. Two additional 
difficulties with this view also occured to me yesterday:

<p>
(1) Using a meta-level argument: If there are all these other <br>
inanimate objects in the reference class, how comes you are not one 
of them? If you were equally likely to turn out to be a grain of 
sand as an observer, then you finding yourself to be an observer 
would have been extremely unlikely.

<p>
(2) What exactly are the members in the reference class supposed to <br>
be? Are the bacteria in your body separate members or are they only 
there as a part of you?  If only fundamental particles are members, 
then you couldn't have been a human since a human is not a particle. 
Which chunks or entities count as individuals?

<p>
So I definitely do not think you can solve the reference class 
problem by including non-observers. It is still unclear, however, 
exactly what (e.g. posthumans?) should be included, and that is 
perhaps the biggest remaining philosophical problem in anthropic 
reasoning.
