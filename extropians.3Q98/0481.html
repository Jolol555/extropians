<a name="0485qlink1">I didn't want to get into the gun debate, but here goes...

<p>
<a name="0501qlink1">I don't want to say guns are bad, or argue about guns per se.</a>  I agree
that it is extropian to be self-reliant and to protect oneself.  And I
certainly can see why many people would turn to guns for that purpose.
In that case, guns *might* be a useful tool.  But hammers, pencils, and
shoes are also useful...  But are they extropian?
</a>

<p>
<a name="0503qlink1">When I think of extropianism, transhumanism, or futurism, I think of
science and technology.  I want to gain life-extension through advanced
biochemistry.  I want to gain exploration through spaceships.  I want to
gain processing power through nanocomputers.</a>

<p>
<a name="0485qlink2">I don't think of gunpowder, explosives, and projectiles.  I don't think
of killing people.  As I plan my extended life, I like to list all the
things that I want to make occur in the future.  Blowing someone's
brains out is not one of them.  I have no desire to pack a weapon and
kill people who get in my way.<a name="0503qlink2">  If my plans would run into the point
that I think I will have to become a killer, I think I would try to
reshape my plans.  If my plans get to the point, that I think that there
is no way to avoid an unpleasant situation and that I am stuck with the
situation that the universe has handed me, I think I would try to change
the universe.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="0503qlink3"><a name="0485qlink3">When somebody comes into my office and lab to see the neat stuff that I
want to demonstrate for the future.<a name="0487qlink1">  I want to show them my computers
and state that those who can keep up with the technology will rule the
future.  I don't want to unlock my gun cabinet and explain that those
who are better armed will rule the future.</a></a>
</a>

<p>
<a name="0485qlink4">I am so sick of hearing Heinlein's quote that "an armed society is a
polite society."  Frankly, I don't want to live in a society where I am
afraid to call someone an asshole because they might blow me away.  If
politeness is based on fear of retribution, that's coersion.  If I am
that afraid to be rude to someone, why would I be any less afraid to
speak out against someone, or to scientifically refute someone's ideas
when they are wrong.  I want future conversations based on rational
debate, and not on retaliatory advantage.  If I wanted that, I would
just start e-mail-bombing anyone here who disagreed with me.  In a war
of network security, I think I would win.  But that's not what I want.
<a name="0503qlink4">If I use a weapon to make someone act polite toward me, no respect has
been gained.</a></a>
