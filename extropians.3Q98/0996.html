It looks like "extropy" as a term has multiple origins.

<p>
Ed Close stated in a posting to the quantum-d mailing list:

<p>
"I.      Regarding Joel Henkel's definition of "extropy":<br>

<p>
In general, I like Joel's ideas, but the term "extropy"
is not new.  As far as I am aware, use of the term "extropy"
originated with work I did beginning in 1986 and published
in 1990.   However, extropy is such a natural concept that
someone else may have coined the term prior to 1990.

<p>
Our definitions are similar.  The word "extropy"  is defined
on Page 36 of my book (see following quotes) and was used
to describe the mirror image of entropy.     

<p>
    '...the organizing force existing prior to relative 
<pre>
     motion... Ex = before or beyond, tropy = turning or
     relative motion.'"

<p>
Evidently, Close "coined" and defined the term in his book
<br>
"Infinite Continuity".<br>
