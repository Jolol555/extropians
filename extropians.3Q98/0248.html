Abstract
<br>
  The effect of biotin administration on the glucose tolerance
  of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic Wistar rats was investigated.
  STZ-induced diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal
  injection of streptozotocin (45 mg/kg body weight as a single dose). The
  impaired glucose tolerance in response to an oral glucose load (1.8g per kg
  body weight) in STZ-induced diabetic rats (STZ-rat) was partially improved by
  intraperitoneal administration of biotin for 15 days (100
  micrograms/rat/day). However, a recovery in the STZ-rat's insulin secretion
  was not found after biotin administration. To help clarify
  the mechanism underlying the improvement in glucose tolerance seen with
  biotin treatment, glucokinase and hexokinase activities were
  determined in the liver and pancreas. In STZ-rats that had received
  biotin (STZ-biotin rats), glucokinase
<br>
  activity was higher by 3.4-fold in liver and by 2.4-fold in pancreas than in
  the STZ-rats. The biotin level of STZ-rats was significantly
  lower in the liver and pancreas than that of the control rats (no STZ
  administration); but in STZ-biotin rats, the level in these
  organs recovered to the control level. These results demonstrate that
  injected biotin can improve glucose handling without
  increasing insulin secretion in STZ-rats.
