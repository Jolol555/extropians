 Not completely, John.

Do you believe that you would be able

to experience both sets of senses at the

experiences from the set of eyes, ears, 
and so on that it is hooked up to, then how
can they be the same person?

Yes, but the same is true of anyone, and that's not
a useful reply. :)

I disagree that it matters what *atoms* are used, 
individually.<a name="0779qlink2">  It *does*, IMHO, matter what continuity
