Hello:
<br>
I'm not a member of the Extropian List but I am an associate of John K Clark 
and I've been looking over his shoulder when he posted some really stupid  
things. He just left his office for lunch but he made the mistake of leaving  
his computer on, he's such a dope, so I figured this is the perfect 
opportunity to set the record straight and send a message to the list.  
Mr. Clark would probably fire me if he knew about this so please keep it 
under your hat.

<p>
<a name="0667qlink1">The important point is that Mr. Clark is dead wrong and there is a huge 
difference between a copy and the original and what's more I can prove it 
with  mathematical certainty.

<p>
Let A = the original  and let  B = the copy

<p>
Let's assume that Mr. Clark is correct and the original is the same as the  
copy, then:

<p>
A = B

<p>
<a name="0835qlink1">Multiply both sides by A and you have

<p>
A^2 = A*B

<p>
Now add A^2 -2*a*B to both sides
</a>
<p>
<a name="0835qlink2">A^2 + A^2 -2*a*B = A*B + A^2 -2*A*B
</a>
<p>
<a name="0991qlink1"><a name="0835qlink3">Using basic algebra  this can be simplified to

<p>
<a name="0672qlink1">2*( A^2 -A*B) = A^2 -A*B
</a>
<p>
<a name="0835qlink4"><a name="0685qlink1">Now just divide both sides by A^2 -A*B and we</a> get
</a>

<p>
2</a> = 1

<p>
<a name="0667qlink2">The conclusion is absurd so the assumption can not be correct, the copy is 
not the same as the original and Mr. Clark does not know his ass from</a> a hole 
</a>
in the ground. 

</a>
<p>
<a name="0667qlink3">I have not told Mr. Clark about my brilliant finding because, because, ah,  
because of a very good reason, the reason is, ah, I was afraid proving him 
wrong would drive him into a fit of suicidal despair. Of course if you were  
to tell the bastard about it there is no way I could stop you, just don't 
mention my name.
