<p>
Evolutionary stability only applies to *iterated* games.  Notably, Tit for
Tat is a *very* well proven strategy for the Prisoner's Dilemma; it's also
in keeping with egoism AND utilitarianism, to that extent.  So in any
situation in which the game is iterated, I'd bet on Tit for Tat.

<a name="0651qlink3">In these situations, there can be only two strategies:  defect or keep

iterated, and that leaves us all worse off.  "Defect" is not a rational
solution to the Prisoner's Dilemma, by the generalization principle. 
"Keep silent" is.

<p>
Utilitarianism does not depend on egoism.  When we play Tit for Tat,
egoism and utilitarianism agree.

<p>
We must never presume that we have eliminated evil; we will always have to
take measures to protect ourselves against crime and coercion, because
there is no utopia...

&gt; NO UTOPIA.<br>
