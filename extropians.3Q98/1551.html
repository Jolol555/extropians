<p>
Whether the "metemorphosis, not doom"-interpretation is even
possible depends on what is the correct solution to the reference 
class problem (see below). My present suspicion is that this 
interpretation is indeed a viable rival to the "doom"-interpretation, 
but it is by no means obvious. And even if we buy this 
"metamorphosis" scenario, it poses problems for those who hope to 
personally survive into the posthuman world.

<a href="1515.html#1551qlink2">&gt; 2) Our concept of "like us" can be biased by where we are </a><br>

<p>
It comes down to this:<a name="1607qlink2"> From what class should you regard 
yourself as being a random sample?</a> This is the reference class 
problem. We need some better way of solving this that appealing to 
what seems fair. Let me try to summarize my current incomplete ideas 
on this issue:

<p>
The best heuristic I know of is the "Amnesia chamber" thought 
experiment. Imagine you have forgotten certain facts about yourself 
and you are asked assign probabilities to various statements. We can 
readily imagine, I think, that this thought experiment can reveal 
your subjective probability of you being born in March conditional on 
an information set which doesn't include any direct knowledge of your 
birthday. This probability would presumably be about 1/12 (or slighly 
greater since March has somewhat above average birth rates, I think).

<p>
We can extract many other subjective conditional probability 
estimates through this method. But for some conditional probabilities 
it won't work. For example:

<p>
C= P(You are a human | You know only you are a material object)

<p>
The problem is that if we tried to induce an amnesia so deep that you 
didn't remember anything other than that you are a material object, 
then we would presumably have caused you to cease to exist as a 
rational being; in that state you would not come up with any 
probability estimates at all.

<p>
This is not a practical problem of what advanced neuroscientists can 
or cannot do. It is a conceptual problem. If we modify you into a 
state where all you remember is that you are a material object, then 
it's just not you any longer. What the entity in that state would say 
is irrelevant, because it wouldn't reflect *your* conditional 
probabilities.

<p>
It therefore seems that it doesn't make sense to ascribe this 
extreme kind of subjective conditional probabilities to people. Your 
conditional probability C is not defined.

<p>
This, I think, means that you cannot regard yourself as a random 
sample from the set of all material objects. How far can we push this 
methodology?


<p>
<a href="1515.html#1551qlink3">&gt; 3) It's actually hard to formalize the argument so that the </a><br>
<i>&gt; implications are big.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="1564qlink2"><i>&gt; For example, Oliver &amp; Korb show that accepting one's birth rank </i><br>
<i>&gt; as a random draw from some total population, with a uniform prior </i><br>
<i>&gt; over that total population, an observation of a low rank changes </i><br>
<i>&gt; the expected value by less than a factor of ten.</i><br>

<p>
No they don't show that. They show that it holds for a few special 
cases. But if you look at the formula at the bottom of page 4 in 
</a>
their tech report, and you hold your own birth rank r constant, you 
see that the expected value E(N|R=r) ~ U/log U when U is large. [U is 
the upper bound on the number of people; N is a variable ranging over 
possible population sizes; R is a variable ranging over possible 
birth ranks.] But E(N)= U/2. So the quotient E(N) / E(N|R=r) ~ 
(U*log U) / (2*U) ~ log U, which becomes arbitrarily large as U goes 
to infinity. So you can get arbitrarily changes even when you have a 
uniform prior.

<p>
In general, the DA will have extra bite if one thinks that we will 
soon colonize the galaxy and thereafter be essentially invulnerable 
to extinction (as Mike Price argued in a fascinating discussion I had 
with him the other night under a starry sky).


<p>
<a name="1564qlink3"><a href="1515.html#1551qlink4">&gt; As another example, Leslie admits in his "shooting room" example</a><br>
<i>&gt; that if the probability of "doom" is constant with time independent</i><br>
<i>&gt; of population size, the doomsday argument fails. </i><br>

<p>
Leslie thinks the DA works in the shooting room in the deterministic 
version. (see p. 254). He doesn't think it works in the radically 
indeterministic case,</a> but then again he doesn't believe the DA works 
in other contexts either if radical indeterminism holds. It has 
nothing to do whether the probability of doom is constant over time.


<p>
<a name="1564qlink4"><a href="1515.html#1551qlink5">&gt; Finally, Nick shows how the argument gets weakened as one allows</a><br>
<i>&gt; for alien creatures "like us" who won't get hurt by our local doom.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, but the fact that we are not posthumans could be taken to 
indicate that there will not have been a great many alien 
</a>posthumans. So either there are only a few alien species, in which 
case the weakening is slight; or there are many alien species, but 
then almost of them go extinct before they become posthumans and why 
should be expect to be different?


<p>
<a href="1515.html#1551qlink6">&gt; 4) Nick explains well how the doomsday argument assumes that</a><br>
<i>&gt; one was guarenteed to show up as a creature "like us" at sometime </i><br>
<i>&gt; in our universe, regardless of how many such creatures this </i><br>
<i>&gt; universe produces.  If one instead assumes that the probability of </i><br>
<i>&gt; finding oneself in a universe is proportional to population of that </i><br>
<i>&gt; universe, the doomsday argument evaporates.  This later assumption</i><br>
<i>&gt; seems much more reasonable to me, and to Kopf, Krtous, &amp; Page.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I buy it even if the different universes are only "possible" </i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than coexisting in some way.  </i><br>

<p>
Yes, this was the objection that I once thought refuted the DA. But 
on second thought there turned out to be big problems with it: the 
no-coincidence objection, and the infinity-objection. I outline these 
in my Investigations paper. How do you suggest we deal with these 
difficulties?
