I saw a trailer the other night for Pleasantville, opening October 16.

<p>
You can't always believe in a preview, but what I saw looked marvelously
inspiring, with overtones of The Truman Show.

<p>
A brother and sister get zapped into a 1950's Leave-It-To-Beaver TV show
called Pleasantville.  This is an old premise but looks to be handled
in a new way.  Through their interactions with the townspeople, modern
elements gradually begin to intrude and threaten the safe, conventional
life of Pleasantville.

<p>
Visually, this is handled by having Pleasantville be in black and white.
The introduction of elements from the real world appears as the addition
of color.  The trailer has beautiful scenes where characters who have
"awakened" are shown in color as they live in their monochrome world.
It's a stunning contrast and should be even more effective in the theater
after seeing nothing by b&amp;w through most of the movie.  Apparently the
film has set a record for most visual effects.

<p>
The music in the trailer is the stirring theme from the Disney movie
Homeward Bound (about the dogs and cat who travel across the Sierra
Nevada to rejoin their family).  Probably this won't be carried over
into the movie, but it's too bad because it really went well with the
theme of overcoming conformity.

<p>
Hopefully the movie will live up to its advance buzz.  Watch for it -

<p>
Hal
