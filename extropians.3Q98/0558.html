Who decides?  Well, Psychologists and Psychiatrists do and summarize the
findings of their empirical research analysis in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual Version IV.  Granted, when the DSM-III first came out
</a>
(late 80's?) homosexuality was still classified as a mental disorder, but
that error has been corrected.  This Manual is revised every several years,
not annually and changes are not considered lightly.  Point being, that if
an anti-gay bill is introduced relying on the presumtion that being gay is
being mentally ill, the opponents of the bill have a much stronger position.
Easier for bigots to use the religious argument I would think.
