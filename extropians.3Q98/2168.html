There surely will be very many elements and constructs exposed by
eliminating arm's length transactions. I don't know whether to agree or
disagree with your principle effect. Maybe in the past we needed such
transactions because we didn't have an intellectual collaborator (Ingrid
on your arm) to do the real world semantic number crunching for us.
Anyway, upon reflection, the standard text book definition of an
investment does appear to have an exponential cancerous component built in
and I think "it" alone is what causes the "arms length" ghetto of today's
rich to immolate themselves to the biggest conflagration of excess the
world has ever seen.

Maybe we can rebuild a better world when the fire's out, eh?
