Abstract
<br>
  The effects of aged garlic
<br>
  extract (AGE), chronically administered in the diet, on
  longevity and spatial learning performances were studied using the
  senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM). A solid diet containing 2% AGE was given
  to senescence-accelerated-prone mouse 8 (SAMP8) and
  senescence-accelerated-resistant mouse 1 (SAMR1) from 2 months of age. The
  survival ratio of SAMP8, a substrain of senescence-accelerated-prone mouse,
  was significantly lower than that of SAMR1, a substrain of
  senescence-resistant mouse. In the SAMP8, administration of AGE perfectly
  prevented the decrease in survival ratio. Moreover, AGE markedly improved the
  learning deficits of SAMP8 in the Morris water maze test. These results
  suggest the possibility that AGE prevents physiological aging and age-related
  memory disorders in human.
