But when have anti-gun laws ever affected criminal access to guns? I haven't
seen a single documented example of removing guns from the hands of the
law-abiding preventing criminals getting them; the Danish government can't 
even keep anti-tank missiles out of the hands of the biker gangs, and a
BATF survey some time ago discovered that around 30% of all illegal guns
siezed in DC were previously stolen from police evidence rooms. If the 
cops are selling guns to criminals, what chance does any law have to 
succeed?

<p>
Certainly in Britain the number of violent crimes committed with guns has
increased vastly since the first anti-gun laws, and illegal guns are often
cheaper than the few varieties which are still legal. Violent criminals
are such a small minority of the population that it takes very few guns
to fulfill their needs.
