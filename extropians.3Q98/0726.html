Abstract
<br>
  Use of oat-supplement has been advocated to reduce serum
  cholesterol concentration. In order to study the
  effect of a daily dietary supplement of
  oats on lipid levels we performed three controlled clinical
  trials in healthy Norwegians and patients with hypercholesterolemia.
  The studies lasted 3-5 weeks, and oats were
  added to the diet in bread, breakfast cereals, porridge or
  crispbread. The serum cholesterol concentrations were
  reduced by 2.5-5% in four of the five groups with an
  oat-supplemented diet. No effect was found
  in the group who ate crispbread. Lipid levels remained
  unchanged in the three control groups. We conclude that
  oat products have a small but significant
  cholesterol-lowering effect when given as a
  supplement to the ordinary Norwegian diet.
