<p>
Don't be sorry.  Thanks for reading so closely: If you got the wrong
impression, anyone would.  In that one particular instance, my intent in the
use of the word "progress" was to convey the meaning "one thing after another"
as in "the progress of events", but because of it's more powerful teleological
connotation, the word has to go.  (As I re-read this with your comment in
mind, I don't know how I could have written this -- other than under the
influence of an overabundance of coffee: Coupled with the phrase "leading
edge", the teleological sense of "progress" seems the obvious
interpretation.).

<p>
Nicholas, consider my offering as modified to read as follows:

<pre>
	Transhumanists do not see mankind as a fallen angel, somehow divorced and
	alienated from a romanticized "nature", but rather as merely one instance of 
	the process of evolution's continuing action in the natural world, and thus
as
	very much a part of nature.. 

</pre>
<p>
Thanks, Damien.
