<i>&gt;From what I understand, prenatal stress during certain fetal critical </i><br>
periods can cause the mother's hormonal levels and ratios to 
fluctuate, resulting in an increased likelihood of homosexual 
orientation in the child.  This makes evolutionary sense; if the 
environment is hostile enough to cause hardship-induced stress to 
the mother, it is likely (the rule - though periodically broken - being 
environmental inertia) to be rough on succeeding generations.  
Individuals who would not have children of their own and could 
therefore devote resources to the well-being of their siblings' 
children would help sustain a genetic line through these times; when 
the environment improved and stress dscreased, so would the 
homosexual percentage of the population.  I believe a study was 
done in Germany with children born in and immediately after the W 
W II period.
