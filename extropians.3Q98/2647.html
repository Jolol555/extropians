     LOGICAL MODEL &amp; PROOF OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF YOGA

     Originating in India in the 5th century AD, the 
     system of numeration used  throughout the world 
     today has proven to facilitate extreme accuracy 
     in the modelling of the physical universe. 

     As we shall observe, the  Hindu  number  system 
     also accurately models -- and thus explains and 
     validates as logical -- the core metaphysics of 
     the Hindu philosophy of yoga, or mystical union.

    BRAHMAN: CONTRADICTION OR TRUTH?

<p>
    The supreme truth in Hinduism is Brahman. Deities 
    such as Shiva and Vishnu represent mere aspects of 
    Brahman. According to Hindu scripture, "Brahman is 
    all"[1] and yet "Brahman is without attributes."[2]
    Having zero attributes, Brahman is called "sunya,"
    which is Sanskrit for void and the number zero.

<pre>
         "Sunya: void; the Nothing which is All. 
           Sunya Brahman: [the brahman as the 
              Void]; Supreme Nothingness." 
             Glossary of Sanskrit terms [3]

</pre>
<p>
    According to scripture, Brahman contains all forms 
    and yet is formless; is the knower, knowledge, and 
    the known and yet is "bereft of knower, knowledge, 
    and known."[4] How can Brahman be all and nothing? 
    How can Brahman be and also not-be x, y, and z? 

<p>
    This all-and-nothing paradox is the nexus of centuries
     of confusion and dispute, not only between East 
    and West but within Eastern philosophical systems. 
    Here then is the resolution of this Hindu "paradox"
    via, appropriately enough, the Hindu number system.


<p>
    NUMBERS: MAPPING THE FACE OF REALITY

<p>
    The claim that x is equal to all and x is equal to
    nothing is true if, and only if,  all is equal to 
    nothing; for, if x = a and x = 0, then a = 0. But 
    how could everything possibly be equal to nothing? 

<p>
    Hindu scripture says that "Brahman is one" (is an 
    undivided unity) but appears to be many due to the 
    process of "differentiation." [5] The mathematical
    definition of difference is that which is obtained 
    by subtraction.[6] The operation of subtraction is 
    therefore both the indicated and logical model of 
    the process by which Brahman appears to be many.

<pre>
           "Treat the laws and relationships 
             of integers like those of the 
            celestial bodies." George Cantor

</pre>
<p>
    The subtraction table models a system wherein that 
    one system (the whole table) is populated with many 
    attributes by the same process that Brahman is populated
<pre>
     by many: by the process of differentiation:
              (fixed-pitch font required)

                       0  1  2  3
                      ____________
                   0 | 0  1  2  3 |
                     |            |
                   1 |-1  0  1  2 |
                     |            |
                   2 |-2 -1  0  1 |
                     |            |
                   3 |-3 -2 -1  0 |
                     --------------


                   Just Like Brahman

               THE TABLE IS ALL &amp; NOTHING

</pre>
<p>
    Exactly like Brahman, the whole table (as a model 
    of a whole universe, or the All) contains all and
    yet is itself equal to nothing, because the sum of 
    all differences between all differentiated numbers 
    will always equal zero no matter how many or few 
    numbers are differentiated. All difference = 0.

<p>
    The significance of difference lies in the fact 
    that difference -- from zero difference, or same 
    as, to nonzero differences -- defines the causal 
    structure of identity, which in turn defines the 
    fundamental nature of every thing and existence.
    Therefore, using the example of the zero-sum of 
    all difference to model the supreme identity is
    not arbitrary, but is the exact model indicated.

<p>
    ERGO: it's a mathematic fact that the sum (yoga) 
    of all differences (Brahman) equals zero (sunya). 
    The all-and-nothing Brahman paradox is therefore 
    not a contradiction but is in fact logically true 
    with respect to the nature of the identity of the 
    All, where the All is a whole system wherein all 
    members are derived from differentiation, which 
    is the means by which Brahman appears to contain 
    many and by which any identity n is defined as n
    (a number n is primary its difference from zero).

<p>
    (The differentiation table, or identity matrix, 
    serves as a comprehensive model of the structure 
    of identity; a more complete analysis of this is
    found here: <a href="http://ian.goddard.net/identity.htm">http://ian.goddard.net/identity.htm</a>)


<p>
    MORE YOGA PUZZLES SOLVED

<p>
    The differentiation table explains not only how
    Brahman can be all and nothing, but it explains 
    many if not all aspects of yogic philosophy such
    as the  profoundly mystical  and seemingly absurd 
    principle of "Ajati," which declares that nothing 
    ever exists or is ever actually created (the same 
    is referred to in Buddhism as the "nonarising" of 
    all apparent phenomena). The nonarising of things 
    defines their void-like, or nonexistent, nature. 
    As the Hindu scripture Mandukya Upanishad says:

<p>
    "[N]either the mind nor the objects perceived 
<pre>
     by the mind are ever born. ... That which is 
     non-existent [0] in the beginning and in the 
     end, is necessarily non-existent [0] in the 
      middle. The objects we see are illusions, 
        still they are regarded as if real." 

                Mandukya Upanishad [7]

</pre>
<p>
    If there is no difference, and then difference
    arises, yet the sum of All difference is equal
    to no difference(0), then in fact only nothing
    arises, hence the nonarising known as "Ajati."


<p>
    LOGICAL UNION OF ATMAN AND BRAHMAN

<p>
    Yoga means "union," the union of the identity 
    of the individual,  the Atman,  with the identity
     of the supreme Brahman, which is the All.

<p>
    As the differential matrix shows, the identity 
    of each thing relative to itself is zero, which
    is the same identity as the identity of the All.
    The zero of self-relation defines the Absolute,
    or nonrelative, nature of identity expressed in
    the differentiation n - n = 0, which means that
    there is no (0) difference between n and n, and 
    therefore n = n -- the definition of identity.

<p>
    So the Absolute identity of each thing (0) is 
    the same as, and thus is united with, the Absolute
     identity of everything (0); which also explains
     why Hindu scripture proclaims that the 
    absolute nature of things is nonexistent (0).


<p>
    THE GOAL OF YOGA EQUALS ZERO (SUNYA)

<p>
    The goal of the practice of yoga is to condition 
    the mind to become like zero and in so doing, to 
    establish an  identity-union  between the finite 
    self, the Atman, and the infinite All, Brahman. 

<pre>
        "Everything is 'I', and I am no thing."
         Ramesh Balsekar, "The Final Truth" [8]

</pre>
<p>
    The traditional yoga lifestyle strives toward the
    goals of asceticism, which seeks to zero-out all
    desires, attachments, emotions, and ego clinging. 
    The goal of yoga is essentially to cause the mind
    to become like zero. In fact, the goal of meditation
      (the central feature of the yoga lifestyle) 
    is to zero-out thoughts, to zero-out the mind and 
    realize the true condition of reality... zero. To 
    know the supreme become like the supreme... zero.

<pre>
      "He who contemplates on sunya...is absorbed 
       into space. . . think on the Great Void un-
       ceasingly. The Great Void, whose beginning 
       is void, whose middle is void, [and] whose 
       end is void...By contemplating continually 
        on this, one obtains success [nirvana]."

                  The Siva Samhita [9]

              Buddhists agree with Hindus:

       "[I]t is only through the understanding of 
       voidness that liberation from cyclic exist-
      ence is possible. ...Insight into voidness is
      therefore called 'the gateway to liberation.'"

         Geshe Rabten, "Echoes of Voidness" [10]


</pre>
<p>
    IN CONCLUSION

<p>
    The central teachings of the philosophy of yoga
    amount to a logical description of the differential
     structure of identity and the zero-sum of 
    all differences, proving that (1) the "All" can 
    be all and nothing (zero); (2) the arising of 
    infinite differences cannot constitute a deviation
     from nothing (zero); and (3) the Absolute 
    (i.e., nonrelative) identity of each individual 
    entity, which is zero, equals the Absolute identity
     of the All, hence their logical union (yoga).

<p>
    This essay clearly proves that the most radically 
    "mystical" and heretofore inexplicable aspects of 
    the Hindu philosophy of yoga are in fact logical.
