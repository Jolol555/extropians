<p>
 Thank you very much for the search order.  
Your free book search request is being circulated 
to our exclusive "in-house" network of book
specialists today. 


<p>
 With any luck you should begin receiving 
quotations within a few days or weeks.


<p>
 If you don't hear from us within 30 days 
you can assume that the book you are looking for 
is quite difficult to find.  At that time, upon
your request, we would be willing to extend our 
search to various public snail mail search 
networks completely free of charge!  These 
searches are slow, but usually more exhaustive.  
Do not expect responses until 30 or 45 days after 
you have asked us to proceed. 


<pre>
                 Sincerely yours,

                 James Daugherty
                 Book Search Co-ordinator, AA Research
   Universal Book Service
                 Service of Alpine Enterprises

<p>
  or e-mail:  &lt;free-search@alpinenterprises.com&gt;


<p>
PPS If the price/edition/quality you seek is 
not forthcoming immediately, worry not.  
Your search request will stay in our system 
indefinitely if you let us know you are still 
interested in further search after you 
<br>
receive a quote.


<p>
Often, by the time we find a really rare item, 
the e-mail address supplied by the customer 
is invalid.  Please cosider supplying your 
snail mail address as back-up!

Subject: Out-of-print &gt;H Texts


<p>
I am attempting to locate a few out-of-print &gt;H-related
books. I've checked every other venue with no success.
The titles and the bounty I'm offering for them are as
follows:

<p>
Freeman Dyson's "Infinite In All Directions" - $50

<p>
David Zindell's "The Broken God" - $30

<p>
Interested sellers should contact me via email.

<p>
Best regards,
<br>
Doug Bailey
