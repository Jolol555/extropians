<a name="1960qlink2">Seriously, I sympathize with Anders' comments, in part. One the most 
difficult adjustments I've had to make when thinking about how the things 
we talk about on this list will play out in the context of society is
abandoning fundamental aspects of the present. Some of the people on 
this list have been thinking deeply about the future for many years and 
a much more adept at "future thinking" than relatively new list members. 
I've only been exposed to transhumanist topics for about a year now and 
while I've come along way, there's much room for improvement. I think a 
healthy amount of tolerance and patience should be exercised by the 
senior list members when dealing with some of the naive notions of the 
newest members. Efforts should be made to help the new members "future 
</a>think". 

<p>
<a name="1960qlink3">For example, the issue that arose in the Sentism thread about ultra-wealthy
individuals "hogging" all the transhuman technologies for themselves is a
classic example of projecting the current socio-economic realities of our
capital-scarce, hard-to-create-gadgets world onto a future with exotic
technologies. The "have and have-not" aspect of human society has existed
since people could realize that they had things. Its hard to emerge out
of that box and conceive of a world where there might not be classic class
rivalry, wealth disparity, and so forth. People have a hard time wondering
how we could get from a world like we have now to such a world. People are
skeptical of utopian predictions.</a>

<a name="1960qlink4"><a name="1943qlink2">One last note, I'm not so sure about your "inventions are usually made by
solitary geniuses with no outside support".</a> On what basis are you making
this claim?</a> I suppose we could look at the percentage of patents that go
to unfunded individuals but I don't have those figures handy. My perception
is that most of the meaningful progress made in technologies such as AI,
brain studies, biotechnology, genetic engineering, nanotechnology,
engineering, etc. are made by researchers funded by large corporations.
There might be limited circumstances such as Wozniak and Jobs or Bell (though
their work-product is impressive) but the lion's share of technological 
progress today is made by researchers funded by business. Correct me if I'm
wrong. :)
