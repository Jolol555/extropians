actually
<br>

<p>
I still have not said this as clear as I want to so let me give it one
more try.  Uploads could use creative ways to reduce or eliminate
mundane work but only in so far as it was truly mundane.  I might find
in the "lessons learned" for example, a request for me to return to
the cyclotron to repeat a particular beam position for myself because
the knowledge gained from this experience is greater and takes less
time than reading about it.


<p>
<i>&gt; And there is the question of how low the wages</i><br>
<i>&gt; for routine work would fall.  The field of upload labor economics is </i><br>
<i>&gt; wide open :-).</i><br>

<p>
Yes, I guess I forgot to realize the wages for mundane work will fall
to the floor even for highly skilled experts.  So I guess I couldn't
quite return to vacation.  But the point of the subject holds.  The
more I think about the economic ramifications the more I realize what
you mean by "wide open".  "My brain hurts a lot" David Bowie
