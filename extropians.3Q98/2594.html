Punctuated equilibrium is something that needs to be explained because of
geological evidence.  Postulating it is not a problem.  In fact, I would say
the major problem with punctuated equilibrium is explaining it to the
loony-toon creationists.

<p>
As I understand it, the innovation is in explaining the punctuated equilibrium
in terms of an exponentially distributed mixture of large and small tweaks. 
The default explanation is large environmental shifts that increase the
selectivity pressures.  Another interesting explanation is a continually
churning pool of small mutations with some synergetic combinations.  The pool
keeps churning until the mutation has a sufficiently large chance of meeting
up with its synergetic "mate", and then the mutation rapidly becomes dominant
throughout the pool.  (This one is also based on computer simulations; the key
percentage is 14% of the population, or the reciprocal of e squared.) 
Personally, I think that all three explanations describe real phenomena.

<p>
Punctuated equilibrium, as the fossil-record phenomenon, neither requires nor
prohibits single big-win mutations.  It is not even necessarily relevant to
the trajectory of a seed AI, since most theories have nothing to do with the
shape of the "hill" one is attempting to climb, or revolve around resistance
barriers that aren't relevant to intelligent design.  I noticed that paper
<a name="2595qlink2">because it explained punctuated equilibrium in a way that exported fairly well
to breakthrough/bottleneck AI trajectories.  It was the first explanation I
</a>
had seen with that property.
