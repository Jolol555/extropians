<p>
Much evident agreement &lt;snipped&gt;
<br>
<a href="0543.html#0553qlink1">&gt;&gt; &gt;If my plans would run into the point</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;that I think I will have to become a killer, I think I would try to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;reshape my plans.  If my plans get to the point, that I think that there</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;is no way to avoid an unpleasant situation and that I am stuck with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;situation that the universe has handed me, I think I would try to change</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;the universe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Indeed. Hear hear. Saving your own life is changing the universe, is it</i><br>
not?
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0543.html#0553qlink2">&gt;Yes. If you are an extropian researcher who develops nanoprobes that can</a><br>
<i>&gt;reconstruct cryogenically frozen humans, then you are saving litterally</i><br>
billions
<br>
<a href="0543.html#0553qlink3">&gt;of lives. If a government agent comes to you, points a gun in your face</a><br>
and tries
<br>
<a href="0543.html#0553qlink4">&gt;to kill you, is your killing that agent right or wrong? There is a difference</a><br>
<i>&gt;between killing and murder.</i><br>

<p>
You appear to be stating the obvious. Is there some subtle thing you
intend? Or are you just making sure of common ground?

<p>
<a href="0543.html#0553qlink5">&gt;&gt; &gt;When somebody comes into my office and lab to see the neat stuff that I</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;want to demonstrate for the future.  I want to show them my computers</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;and state that those who can keep up with the technology will rule the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;future.  I don't want to unlock my gun cabinet and explain that those</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;who are better armed will rule the future.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; As more power is concentrated in your computers, expect them-and-yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to be treated exactly the way others-and-their-guns are treated. How are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; you going to prove you have a trigger lock on that GP assembler, hombre?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; How are you going to convince me you can be trusted with that Orion engine</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; you plan to build?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How do I know that you can be trusted with the power supply that keeps</i><br>
hundreds of
<br>
<i>&gt;AI's alive???</i><br>

<p>
What's your point? Who are you talking to here? I'm confused.


<p>
<a href="0543.html#0553qlink6">&gt;&gt; Fools are fools, no matter what they have in their hands. The problem here</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is impulse control, not guns. Self government makes the whole gun matter a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; non-issue. Absent more prevalent self government, the human race has a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; dim future.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hardly. Self government mandates self defense to whatever level the</i><br>
individual
<br>
<a href="0543.html#0553qlink7">&gt;feels negates the accepted risk level.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="0643qlink1">"Hardly"? I think you miss my point. I'll break it down: The "_*gun*_" (qua
gun) issue is a non-issue to any set of people which is largely
self-governing (no "Gummint"/minimal "Gummint"). Such people don't give a
hoot whether another of their kind owns a gun, as long as they can/do too.
Thus it is a _non-issue_ for them. Get me?

<p>
I get tired of making this point, but it boils down to "it's not about gun
control, it's about impulse control, stupid." :) High individual
self-government-&gt;high impulse control-&gt;less fear of technology X-Y-Z in
individual hands, as long as the said hands are also not cocksure or
arrogant. Are we in agreement about this?

<p>
Your "Hardly," as situated, appears to be a dismissal of my last sentence.
I stand by it. 
<br>
What say you?
