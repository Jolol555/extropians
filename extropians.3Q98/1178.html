Subject: Prize offered for first private spacecraft

<p>
from <a href="http://www.xprize.org">http://www.xprize.org</a> 

<p>
The XPRIZE® is a $10,000,000 prize to jump-start the space tourism
industry through competition between the most talented entrepreneurs and
rocket experts in the world. Following in the footsteps of over 100 aviation
prizes offered between 1905 and 1935 which created today's multibillion dollar
air transport industry, the XPRIZE will be awarded to the team which designs
the first private spaceship which successfully launches three humans to a
sub-orbital altitude of 100 km on two consecutive flights within two weeks.
All
<br>
teams must be privately financed. 

<p>
Competitors: 

<p>
As of April 30, 1998 the international competition is open to all teams which
abide by the XIPRIZE rules. 14 teams are currently registerd. 

<p>
Funding: 

<p>
St.Louis business leaders have provided over $1.50 million in funding to
support the Foundation's work in organizing the competition. With this support
in place, the Foundation is now working to raise the full $10 million purse. 

<p>
St.Louis Connection: 

<p>
The XPRIZE is headquartered in St.Louis because of the connection with
Charles Lindbergh and the Spirit of St.Louis whose historic 1927 flight
changed the course of aviation history. St.Louis is working with the XPRIZE
Foundation to promote the city as a visionary, high-tech community. 

<p>
New Spirit of St.Louis Organization 

<p>
The New Spirit of St.Louis Organization is composed of business leaders
who have each contributed to the XPRIZE Foundation to help to create the
competition. Historically, the original "Spirit of St.Louis" organization
consisted
<br>
of nine St.Louisans who jointly contributed $25,000 in 1927 to support
Charles Lindbergh's attempt to win the Orteig Prize. 

<p>
Endorsements: 

<p>
The XPRIZE has been endorsed by leading space and aviation organizations
including: The Association of Space Explorers, the US Space Foundation, the
National Space Society, Federation Aeronautique Internationale, the Aeroclub
de France, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Society
of Experimental Test Pilots, the Experimental Aircraft Association, and the
Explorers Club. 

<p>
Historical Analog: 

<p>
By 1929, governments, individuals, newspapers and major corporations had
offered more than 50 major aeronautical prizes. Among them was the Orteig
Prize, a $25,000 cash prize sponsored by a wealthy hotel owner, Raymond
Orteig, for the first person or persons to fly non-stop between New York and
Paris. The Orteig Prize stimulated not one, but nine separate attempts to
cross
<br>
the Atlantic. To initiate the flights, competitors raised and spent some
$400,000, or 16 times the amount of the prize. As a result of these early
aviation prizes, the world now enjoys a $250 billion aviation industry.
