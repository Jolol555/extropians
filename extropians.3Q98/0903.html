<p>
<a name="0906qlink1"> I am confident that someday objections to uploading will seem as silly
as the fear that cameras steal people's souls, but I'm worried that
prejudice against the first uploads will cause serious problems, and I
suspect people like Harvey are worried about whether they will miss out
on some important advantages to being one of the early uploads.
 Predictions about maturing upload societies seem less urgent than
debates that may affect the rights of the first uploads.
