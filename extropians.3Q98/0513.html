those issued with carry permits, and most are "unsuited" only because
of minor technicalities (e.g. taking a gun into a bar, which is normal
behaviour in Israel). I think there has been one murder committed by
a person with a concealed carry permit, but with 150,000 or more issued
over eleven years that's pretty good going.

<p>
People who go through all the hassle of getting legal carry permits are
the kind of people who don't break the laws in other ways; and since very
few violent crimes are committed by people who don't have a prior record,
they wouldn't get permits anyway. Of course the criminals don't care and
just carry illegally.
