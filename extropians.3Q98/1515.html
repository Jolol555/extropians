I've just spent the last 24 hours reconsidering the Doomsday 
argument, including Leslie's book, Nick's paper, and the two 
articles Nick cites that I could find on the web (at:

The basic argument is that, all else equal, we should not expect 
to be temporally among the first, say, 5% of creatures "like us." 
So given exponential growth with a sudden end, that end is near. 

<p>
I'm currently pretty negative on the doomsday argument. 


<OL>
<a name="1551qlink1">  <li>  Even when it is valid, the argument suggests "change," and 
not necessarily "doom".  Creatures like us can no longer exist 
because their descendants are different, but not destroyed.</a>

<a name="1564qlink1"><a name="1551qlink2">  <li>  Our concept of "like us" can be biased by where we are 
</a>in time.  No fair picking the last big intelligence change, and
then defining "like us" to be anything at least as smart as we 
are.  Better to exclude smarter creatures as well as dumber.</a>

<a name="1551qlink3">  <li>  It's actually hard to formalize the argument so that the 
implications are big.  


</OL>
<p>
For example, Oliver &amp; Korb show that accepting one's birth rank 
as a random draw from some total population, with a uniform prior 
over that total population, an observation of a low rank changes 
</a>
the expected value by less than a factor of ten.  Kopf, Krtous, 
&amp; Page also show that expected values don't change much for a 
power law prior on total population, unless the power is near
minus two. 

<p>
<a name="1551qlink4">As another example, Leslie admits in his "shooting room" example
that if the probability of "doom" is constant with time independent
of population size, the doomsday argument fails.</a>  (The expected
population is infinite here, so stuff depends on how you slice it.)
<a name="1551qlink5">Finally, Nick shows how the argument gets weakened as one allows
for alien creatures "like us" who won't get hurt by our local doom.</a>

<p>
I suspect that the more these models get elaborated with our 
detailed knowledge relevant for forecasting "doom" or change, 
the less important the doomsday type selection effect would be.

<p>
<a name="1551qlink6">4) Nick explains well how the doomsday argument assumes that
one was guarenteed to show up as a creature "like us" at sometime 
in our universe, regardless of how many such creatures this 
universe produces.<a name="1564qlink5">  If one instead assumes that the probability of 
finding oneself in a universe is proportional to population of that 
universe, the doomsday argument evaporates.</a>  This later assumption
seems much more reasonable to me, and to Kopf, Krtous, &amp; Page.
I buy it even if the different universes are only "possible" 
rather than coexisting in some way.  
</a>


<p>
In summary, I don't buy a basic assumption of the doomsday argument,
and even if I did the implication seems only a moderately higher 
chance of change, not doom.
