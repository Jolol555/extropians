yup.  another approach: try to find the types of questions that folks
wouldnt mind revealing about themselves, and no one would have
much motive to wreck your database.  the example of the link between
coffee and kidney stones has stumped doctors, because you have
opposing effects.  caffiene is a diuretic, so it stimulates urination, so
it encourages thirst and increased drinking of fluids: good,
however coffee also contains chemicals that may produce oxalates: bad.
so is coffee good or bad for kidney stones?

<p>
nowthen, most folks dont mind telling how many kidney stones they
have suffered, nor do they mind telling how many javas they quaff,
however, for these data to be interpretable, we would also need to know...
the age of the respondant.  {8-[   which people dont like to tell.

<p>
so.  im still looking for a good test case.  spike
