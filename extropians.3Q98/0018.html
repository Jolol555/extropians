Sigh. You still miss my point: even very rare crazies with
sufficiently powerful weapons are a problem. It is a simple product:
population * proportion of crazies using big weapons * tech level =
amount of damage done. I don't think crazies are a major problem
today, but they might very well be in the future if the conditions</a> are
right.

<p>
Did you read my analysis in my first post in this thread at all? I did
point out that limiting access to many such technologies is hard or
impossible. I also pointed out that it isn't given that a defense
exists against all technologies, although this is still unsettled.</a>

<a name="0043qlink3"><a href="0015.html#0018qlink3">&gt; &gt;I think you miss my point in this thread: there is a real problem is</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;certain technologies of mass destruction become too available and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;there are no good ways of protecting from them or avoiding them. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But there are; I've given you the most effective defence against every</i><br>
<i>&gt; single one of them: don't be there when it happens. I'm talking about</i><br>
<i>&gt; living in reality, Brin and others are playing S&amp;M fantasy games.</i><br>

<p>
In order to convince me that you are really realistic, you better
convince me that you can get personal off-world capability before the
risk posed by crazies with big guns becomes severe.

favorite political memes. Let's try to do some risk assessments based
on facts and reasonable extrapolations.</a>
