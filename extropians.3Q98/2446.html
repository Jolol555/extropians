<p>
To those individuals participating in the bleeding edge techno-culture,
anyone less technological is a savage, while the 'superhuman' is never in
existence, as it is always 'todays' ideal for improvement. I'll make a
stab at a chart to illustrate this:

where: x axis is time relative to the observers present
and y axis is advancement.
<br>
As the absolute level of advancement of the observer rises, the 's' curve
contracts, but the observer always considers themselves to be 'human', and
their own ability to see further up the curve expands to counteract the
contraction of the 's' curve. This might also help in the opposite
direction. As we can see further up the curve and still consider occupants
of that advanced level of the curve to be 'human' compared to us, we might
also expand our vision DOWN the curve to consider even more primitive
forms of life as 'human', provided there is some means of communication
that can be attained.
