<a href="0149.html#0268qlink1">&gt;The only real danger of such a society would be the enormous number of deaths</a><br>

<p>
Damn, that explains all those thousands killed in arguments in Florida
since the mandatory concealed carry permit law was passed. Oh, no, but
they haven't have they? How strange.

<p>
<i>&gt;And no, I do not think that an armed society would</i><br>
<i>&gt;result in less crime.  I do think that it would result in more deaths.</i><br>

<p>
However, reality doesn't care what you think. Go and read some criminological
research on guns and violence (a quick web search for "Gary Kleck" and 
"Point Blank" will give you most of what you need).

<a href="0184.html#0268qlink2">&gt;&gt; Dodge City was a pretty safe place to</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; live before they started that sheriff racket. :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;No it wasn't.  Check the historical statistics on it.</i><br>

<p>
I'd be interested to see those historical statistics you're talking about; 
those I've seen showed it was about as safe as Europe today.
