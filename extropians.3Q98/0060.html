And as others have pointed out, we are, or should be, the most serious
survivalists on the planet. Most survivalists only want their "three
score years and ten", we want immortality, or at least an indefinite
lifespan. You don't get there by ignoring reality in order to protect
your image.

<p>
The total cost to me of preparing for major disruption due to year-2000
bugs is about $40 in lost interest payments on the money I'm spending.
Everything I'm buying is useful and I'd probably buy it anyway, sooner
or later. So if nothing happens, I'm out $40.

  <li>  Almost no software project finishes on time, and almost no major
     software project finishes within six months of the expected dates.

     higher-level managers lie even more. This is why most projects spend

  <li>  Many companies don't even have source code for many of their systems,
     and they cannot be fixed without it. Many companies who produced the
     systems for which they don't have source code no longer exist, and
     the source went with them.
  <li>  Many bugs cannot be eliminated without a full-scale test.
  <li>  We rely on noncompliant software in ways that most people don't
     even begin to understand.

<p>
So on that basis, there is at least a 90% probability of some major
systems going down for weeks in the next couple of years, and a strong
probability of very serious disruptions in all areas.

<p>
So as someone who wants to live a very long time I think: OK, strong
probability of serious disruption, cost to avoid it $40. Hmm, not too
hard, is it? If that makes me an evil unpatriotic survivalist, then so
be it. Better a bad image than dead.
