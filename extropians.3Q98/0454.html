Yes, and it's entirely possible that I'm the only conscious being in the  
universe, the two possibilities are related and have equal probability of 
being true.

<p>
Exactly. If evolution is correct and if other people really are conscious 
then sentience must by a side effect of intelligence. You could perhaps argue 
that there are other longer routes and that consciousness is just a short cut 
to intelligence and that's why evolution picked it, but that would mean it 
would be harder for us to make an unconscious intelligent robot than a
conscious one.

<p>
Yes you can make a case for it, and I even think it's true, I just can't 
prove  it, I can't show that an even stronger case for something other than  
consciousness won't be found that explains behavior even better.

What does cat mean? What does cap mean? what does ca~ mean? What does ca&amp;  
mean? If there are an infinite number of letters you can't define them all.                      

<p>
I'm having difficulty understanding your position, first you propose a rule 
of thumb that I think is both practical and reasonable:


<p>
<a href="0392.html#0454qlink7">        &gt;If mental content provides the best explanation for the object's         </a><br>
<i>        &gt;behavior, however, then I agree that we should  consider it as having         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;mental content.</i><br>


<p>
Agreed. I experience my own mental content directly but behavior is the only 
way to deduce it in others. The trouble I'm having is that later you say:
               

<p>
<a href="0392.html#0454qlink8">        &gt;I don't think that we can deduce meaning from behavior, </a><br>


<p>
If so then we can't deduce meaning from anything and we should stop using the 
word in relation to anyone or anything except ourselves.
