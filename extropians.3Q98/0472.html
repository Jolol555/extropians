     &gt;*Simulating* wetness is considerably more difficult, and it could be      
     &gt;argued that you can't simulate wetness without simulating water as well. 
            

</pre>
<p>
True, especially if you insist on going from first principles. Nobody has 
ever calculated the freezing point of water starting from the equations of 
Quantum Mechanics. It's can be done in principle but it's too complex in 
practice, maybe in 20 years, less if somebody makes a Quantum Computer.
