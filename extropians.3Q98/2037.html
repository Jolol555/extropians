I think increasing the world avg. income would be far more plausible than
getting every person who earns 25,000+ to pay 75% in tax or donations.

<p>
I have no doubt that the distribution of wealth is similar to those
figures you have stated here.  It is this distribution, however, that
provides momentum in the economy.  It gives incentive for individuals to
earn more and provides a concentration of funds that companies can then
reinvest in new technologies.  This adds to the total wealth of the
system.

<p>
The challenge therfore is to find a economic model that allows a more
equitable distribution of wealth whilst not reducing the incentives to
generate wealth.

Unfortunately these are the three question most people will
ask.</a>  Answering these questions with "It's the right thing to do." will
compel only a few individuals to act.  A better way to answer is to point
out the benefits of paying.<a name="2060qlink1">  Bringing third world countries up to frist
world standards provides many wealth generating advantages to
both countries and coporations.</a>
