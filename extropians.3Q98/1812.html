The problem with all drugs is that people are different, and a drug
that is extremely potent in me could be worthless for you. Some people
may have a resistance to exogenous melatonin, or a circadian rhythm
that remains disturbed much longer due to jet-lag than for others. My
guess is that the thing to look for is other substances involved in
the circadian rhythm, so that they can be used in combination with
melatonin to lock it more efficently.

<p>
That sounds rather suspicious; imagine a sleeping pill with that
label! Melatonin might be fairly safe, but it isn't a good idea to
pile it up in the system.
