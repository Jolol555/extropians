<i>&gt; cannot make the government more efficient at tracking every move simply</i><br>

<i>&gt; it to do most things, and many of the things you DO use it for don't involve</i><br>
<i>&gt; your number being sent to some map where your movements are plotted in real-</i><br>
<i>&gt; time.  This paranoia over an ID card is silly.  Frankly, an ID card is</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely useful.</i><br>

<p>
Ok, here is another here and now factoid for your consumption. Last fall, my
brother was fishing in a stream. As he left the stream, he came across a gentleman
in a pickup staring intently at the screen of a laptop computer, which had a
RADAR-like display with little dots moving up stream. When asked, it turned out
that this man was a fisheries officer, and was tracking the migrating salmon via
needle sized chip/transponders that had been implanted in them prior to their
release as youngsters. The officer said that he had a range of up to a mile in
tracking these fish....

<p>
Yes an ID is extremely useful. That is the point of its being used as a tracking
device as well. The more difficult it is for each and every one of us to get
through life without one makes it that much easier for big brother to use it as a
platform when and where they find the neccessity/excuse to use it to violate the
rights we take for granted. You do not even need to know that your rights are
being violated for it to happen.

<p>
<a href="0122.html#0157qlink2">&gt; I'm sorry that I didn't see the post that you quoted and responded to it</a><br>
<i>&gt; directly, but a government that governs least does not necessarily govern</i><br>
<i>&gt; best.  To make that principle, often quite useful, dogmatic and apply it</i><br>
<i>&gt; blindly to every conceivable service government could provide is simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; foolish.  In our society we have need for a reliable form of identification.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And to have the government provide simply does not violate any rights.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not give the government power to violate any rights.  So what's all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fuss about, besides getting worked up over wild predictions of an Orwellian</i><br>
<i>&gt; future?  Note, of course, that it seems rather implausible that whether or not</i><br>
<i>&gt; we have such a future ahead of us hangs upon the issuance of a card form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; government identification.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
If the government makes the platform upon which they can track you a mandatory
item for you to get through your day, then you no longer have a choice about it,
and therefore your rights are violated.
