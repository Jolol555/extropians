<p>
The fact is that this is happening all over. This is directly correlated
to 
<br>
the increase in young people, particularily young males. 

<p>
It's like Wm. Burrough's Economics of a Junkie (junkies know what they
each would prefer to take, but in need they will use anything). In a
similar vein, the violence-prone also know what they would prefer to
use, but when the mood hits, they'll use whatever they can get their
hands on.

<p>
In a macro-societal sense, the problem will pass as the violence-prone
are put down, locked up, or just grow older. As the Danish poet Piet
Hein explained in his poem TTT, ting tager tid (ie, things take time).

<p>
In a micro-societal sense, I am at a loss to understand why restrictions
should exist on the ability of of folks to protect themselves as best
possible. But then I guess I'm another extropian(-wannabe) with those
nasty libertarian tendencies...
