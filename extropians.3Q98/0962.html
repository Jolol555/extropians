It takes a bit more to be an Extropian than demanding the best possible
treatment for one's heart condition. Most people would willingly pay
for such a thing, if they had the money. It's things like a cryonics
contract that really separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak.

It could be that, like most people, Mr. Packer is not aware of
transhumanism and its death-defying technologies. Perhaps someone could
notify him, just in case (you never know, right...) Better hurry up
though ;)
