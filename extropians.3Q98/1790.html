&gt;Would someone briefly summarize Tipler's argument here?
</a>
&gt;the local library doesn't carry The Physics of Immortality
&gt;and I don't want to buy the book to find out.

<p>
I sent this to the list in March of 1996


<p>
I just finished reading Frank Tipler's book  "The Physics of
immortality" today. I had put off reading it for long time
because I didn't think it would be any good, I was wrong it's
quite good, but I wish he had spent less time trying to justify
existing religious beliefs.

<p>
Tipler thinks that the universe will be able to perform an
infinite number of calculations between now and the final
singularity at the end of the Big Crunch. With this much
computer power it would be easy to emulate every human being who
ever lived and do it for an infinitely long subjective time. I
have never taken the idea of an infinite mind very seriously,
and I'm not  sure I do yet but one thing I am sure of is that
Tipler's critics were  being unfair when they labeled it
Pseudo Science. His ideas might be completely  wrong but
they are not silly because it's possible to prove it wrong.
Tipler's Omega  Point Theory makes a bunch of predictions,
practical predictions that should be able to be tested for in
the next 4 or 5 years. Tipler himself states that  every one
of these predictions must turn out to be correct or the entire
 theory is dead in the water.


<UL>
  <li>  Tipler predicts that the universe is closed: I think most
  would say   it's probably open, Tipler say's they're wrong.

  <li>  Tipler wrote his book in early 1992 and predicted that the
  mass of the Top Quark would be 185 +- 20 GeV: At the time
  there was a report that it was at 135 GeV, Tipler said this
  must be in error and it turned out he was right. In March
 1995   Fermi Lab found the Top Quark at 180 +- 13 GeV.

  <li>  Tipler predicts that the Higgs boson must be at 220 +- 20 GeV:
  If he's  correct then when the CERN Large Hadron Collider goes
  on line in 1999 it   will find it almost immediately.


</UL>
<p>
*Tipler predicts that the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic
  background  black body  radiation must be less than 6 * 10^-5:
  This prediction looks  good, the observed value is around
  5 * 10^-6.


<UL>
  <li>  Tipler predicts that the Hubble constant must be less than or
  equal to 45:  30 years ago most thought it was about 200, a
  year ago most thought it was   85, today people are talking
about
  55.

  <li>  Tipler predicts that at maximum extent just before it starts
  to contract  the universe must be 70^3 times larger than it is
  now or larger: This depends on the density of the universe so
  we'll have to clear up all the   confusion over "Dark Matter"
  before we can tell how well he's doing on this   one.


</UL>
<p>
Tipler makes some other predictions that  he doesn't know how to
test for but there is no reason to think that it would be
impossible
<br>
for anyone to figure out a way.


<UL>
  <li>  Tipler predicts that the contraction of the universe will not
   be   symmetrical.

  <li>  Tipler predicts that the entire universe is a past light cone:
  This means  that if you send out a beam of light eventually it
  will circle the entire   universe and come back and hit you in
  the back of the head, the time it   takes to this  depends on
  the size of the universe. Tipler says light will   be able to
  make an infinite number of such trips before the universe
  collapses into a singularity.

  <li>  Tipler predicts that both density and energy will diverge to
  infinity  during the big crunch but the density must not
  diverge faster than the  cube of the energy.


</UL>
<p>
I was really surprised that this outrageous philosophical theory
was a Scientific theory too and could have  so many testable
consequences.
