<p>
<a name="1339qlink1">Come now, Tony, you know very well that tax *rates* decreased under
Thatcher. (They couldn't go much higher than under the previous Labour
govt. which had rates up to 98% -- 83% income tax plus a 15% investment
income surcharge.)</a> Of course, total tax revenue increased as the economy
grew and people had less incentive to hide their hard-earned money.

 (so she had no problems with 'stealing' money

<i>&gt;just disappeared, crushed out of existence by high interest rates and a </i><br>

<p>
<a name="1339qlink2">For nothing? The British economy ended up in much better shape than it was.
Anyway, more of your blame for the painful transition should go to those
who propped up old, unprofitable manufacturing for decades.</a> When the cure
was implemented (of course it could have been done much better), the
results were much more painful than they would have been if the economy
hadn't been abused for so long.

<p>
Ah, of course, if I have a different view from you, I must be unthinking.
Thanks for clarifying that.

<p>
95% of all the medical scientists and 
<br>
<a href="1265.html#1299qlink4">&gt;  technologists who ever lived are alive and working right now.  Ditto for </a><br>
<i>&gt;  other scientists and technologists who provide the backbone, the impetus </i><br>
<i>&gt;  and the detailed support for your entire programme!  Now guess who's </i><br>
<i>&gt;  paying them.</i><br>

<p>
Mostly private industry. Many others are wastefully employed by the state.
No doubt, much productive research would be slowed if the state suddently
stopped science funding *and nothing else changed*. But, if the state
generally withdrew from life, the beneficial economic effects would soon
mean more funding for science due to a stronger and faster growing economy.
