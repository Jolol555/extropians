<a name="2062qlink1">I think this misses the point.  Imagine that your brain and my brain were
hybridized (possibly through/with an AI).  At that point, we would no
longer use an "economy" to allocate resources; we'd just make up our
collective mind and go for it.  So the goal is not to eliminate
speculation, but to eliminate the economy and replace it with a different,
very complex system.</a>

<p>
I think.  Legg's posts have a very high buzzword ratio.

This is interesting.  What sort of parallels do you see?

<a name="2076qlink1">The impression I got was that Brin thinks encryption will be pointless when
one can maneuver a fly-sized camera into your home and watch you type in
the cleartext of your message before you have a chance to encrypt</a> it.
Heck, reading the cleartext even beats OTPs. ;)

<p>
Personally, I'm dubious as to the degree to which this is possible; it's
certainly not possible in realtime, but the fly-camera could work if it
recorded onto some kind of very small RAM system and then returned home to
upload the recording onto a larger computer.  Diffraction problems could be
solved by having multiple bugs staring at the same thing and having a
computer sort out what the true image looks like.  Again, not possible in
realtime, but if the bugs took shifts, it wouldn't be a big issue.
