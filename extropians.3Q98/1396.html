Well, Mark, of course, you are perfectly correct (in my ever-humble
opinion). The fact is that when it comes to behavior in life, in
general, men are more like a lottery--they scatter ( in a mathematical
sense). They are gamblers at life. Women are closer to the mean in
almost all life behaviors--generally! &lt;insert 4-page spiel on
evolution and childbearing, etc&gt;.

<p>
And since the gov't and business depends on women in the workforce and
at the ballot box, it has become politcally correct to bash these
kinds of ideas.
<br>
And even extropian/cryo women, freethinking and radical and
unsheeplike as they are, are susceptible to societal attitudes.

<p>
 Such is life. Westen Civ swing like a pendulum do....
