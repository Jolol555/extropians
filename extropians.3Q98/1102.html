It's not *that* old.  It's a 19th century phenomenom (still pre-Coca-Cola).  
In the 18th century wealthy English on average had more children than 
poor or middle class ones.  I believe the first country to experience the 
demographic transition, including the inversion of the traditional association
between wealth and fecundity, was France, shortly after the Revolution.

<p>
A point: the driving force is not wealth but female education.  Wealth plus 
uneducated women (some Muslim countries) = high birth rate; education plus
poverty (the Indian state of Kerala) = low birth rate.  There's just a very 
strong correlation between wealth and education, with causation probably going
in both (educated people tend to get rich and rich children tend to get
educated)
