<p>
By "evolved systems" do you mean strictly biological systems which have
evolved over billions of years, or do you mean more general systems
which use evolution as a design methodology?  It may turn out that many
artificial systems will be designed at least in part using evolutionary
methods like genetic algorithms.</a>

<p>
<a href="1198.html#1204qlink2">&gt; While larger systems may contain subsystems of both types, I expect </a><br>
<i>&gt; limitations on the granularity of integration, exactly because our </i><br>
<i>&gt; limited understanding of evolved systems limits our flexibility in </i><br>

<i>&gt; cows are certain chemical processes in their stomaches, but cow systems</i><br>
<i>&gt; are hard to disentangle, so we'll leave them as units for some time to</i><br>
<i>&gt; come.  </i><br>

<p>
<a name="1207qlink2">On the other hand, during the era in which we are biological entities
there will be great value in understanding the tangled processes which
produce life (and health), as well as finding ways to marry technology to
these naturally evolved systems.</a>  Once nonbiological options exist this
will become less important, but in the meantime we may have achieved
good enough understanding of biology that we will be able to integrate
it into more complex systems.
