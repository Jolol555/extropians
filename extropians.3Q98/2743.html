John Clark (jonkc@worldnet.att.net) asked:

<p>
<a href="2118.html#2743qlink1">&gt;I write a computer program that increases the efficiency </a><br>
<i>&gt;of a company and lowers it's expenses by by 20$. I sell </i><br>
<i>&gt;it to the company for 10$. Where is the zero sum? </i><br>


<p>
  IAN: The zero-sum exists in total, if expenses 
  were 5 (just as a random example) and then they 
  became 2, they were 3 more and now are 3 less, 
  that's 3 + (-3) = 0 difference over all time.

<p>
  If the expense of running A (something) is 5 more 
  than the expense of running B (nothing), then the 
  expense of B is 5 less than running A,  which
  means we have 5 + (-5) = 0 total experience.

<p>
  Zero expense exists, since the entire universe
  (sum total of all space-time) expends (losses) 
  nothing. Yes, heat is lost, but ONLY by subsets
   of All. All is always the same as it- 
  self, and thus the expense of All = 0.

<p>
  That is why everything is a zero-sum game. 
  Is this not logical? If not, then how so?
