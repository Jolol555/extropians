this is something i have been thinking about for years.  i am told thata member
is not acepted into the inner city gang culture until one
has been to prison, preferrable maximum security, for which one usually
must commit a violent crime.  result: prison is not adequately feared among
this subset.

seems we could arrange for female hormones to be added to prison
food for violent male offenders.  or perhaps even spread a rumor among
the inmates that this is being done.<a name="0575qlink1">  if nothing else, this might cause the
