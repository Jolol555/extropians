You'll see quite a few familiar names in life extension quoted in an
article at:


<p>
<a href="http://www.insideboulder.com/extra/last-rights/">http://www.insideboulder.com/extra/last-rights/</a>

<p>
I'm a bit frustrated at what they chose to quote from me and what they left
out. Especially when, immediately before the first quote from me the
<a name="2623qlink1">reporter writes: "Butler, the gerontologist, said: "I think we're not
spending enough money on aging and life-extension research, but I'm not
sure if longevity enthusiasts are helping the cause. I think they're
hurting it by their outrageous statements that have no basis in fact." 
Futurists feel no such fetters and rarely worry about exactly how or when
their predictions will occur. "

<p>
What I said was that I was not willing to predict when a major life
extension breakthrough would occur since it depended on breakthroughs that
no one accurately time. This quote above implies something quite different.

<p>
Still, it's good to see more coverage of these ideas.</a>
