<a href="0292.html#0312qlink1">        &gt;This seems to me to be a very common mistake. :)  The music</a><br>
<i>        &gt;*isn't* the "same"; it is only very similar.  That is, they</a> are </i><br>
<a name="0318qlink2"><i>        &gt;not really one piece of music, but two, that happen to differ</i><br>
<i>        &gt;only in location.  They do differ, though.</i><br>
         

</pre>
<p>
This is completely wrong, that is say that the E mail message</a> you sent me  
<a name="0318qlink3">contained erroneous ideas, I have no way of knowing if</a> the original message  
<a name="0318qlink4">you typed on your computer was right or wrong because I never saw</a> it, all I 
<a name="0318qlink5">saw was a copy and that's just not the same thing.</a>
           

<p>
<a name="0318qlink6"><a href="0292.html#0312qlink2">        &gt;I will agree with this.  There is no way to tell the difference, </a><br>
           

<p>
If there is no way to tell the difference then what makes</a> you think there is 
a difference?
<pre>
           
<br>
<a href="0292.html#0312qlink3">        &gt;Of course, if the CDs themselves are expected to be aware, then the         </a><br>
<i>        &gt;first CD will never know it is "offline", any more than other dead         </i><br>
<a name="0318qlink8"><i>        &gt;people know that they are dead.</i><br>

<p>
For some reason in these thought experiments people always identify with the 
<a name="0318qlink9">"original", just for fun imagine what it's like to be the "copy".</a> You may  
<a name="0318qlink10">have been created only 5 minutes age but it doesn't matter because</a> you have 
<a name="0318qlink11">the memories of Randall R Randall, you remember being the Randall R</a>  Randall 
of yesterday<a name="0318qlink12"> so the Randall R Randall of yesterday is not dead. Death means 
having a last thought and Randall R Randall hasn't had one</a> of those yet.

<p>
<a name="0318qlink13">I probably haven't convinced you but I'll bet I could have if only</a> you'd seen 
<a name="0318qlink14">my original message, it was great and would have really knocked your socks off 
but unfortunately you'll just have to settle for a copy.</a>
