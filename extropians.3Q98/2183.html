Yeah. I'm sure the little old lady will feel really happy as she lies dying
on the floor after the thugs beat her up,<a name="2218qlink2"> knowing that -- Thank God! -- a
</a>
surveillance camera recorded the whole thing and the thugs might, possibly,
be caught. If the operator wasn't using the zoom lens to peep at the other 
women in the carriage; which is apparently the single largest use of the
British police surveillance cameras, according to a recent report.</a>

<a name="2218qlink3">This is the whole problem with surveillance; it's purely an attempt to deter
criminals with the threat of potential capture, and most of them aren't 
going to stop because</a> of it. I recently saw a surveillance video of a few
<a name="2218qlink4">kids on a British housing estate who smashed up a car with rocks then
set it on fire, in full view of the camera. Maybe the kids were caught --
though the resolution was so low I doubt I could identify them from it --
but I'm sure that won't make the car's owner any happier.
