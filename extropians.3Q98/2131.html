Subject: Hippocampus and independent component analysis


<p>
I would like to announce the availability of a new paper on
the functional model of the hippocampus. The model fits
smoothly the overall anatomical structure and its two-phase
operational mode. The model is built on two basic postulates:
(1) the entorhinal-hippocampal loop serves as a control
<p>
    loop with control errors initiating plastic changes
    in the hippocampus and
<br>
(2) the hippocampal output develops independent components
<p>
    in the entorhinal cortex

<p>
The paper

                  a functional model of the hippocampus

Abstract:

<p>
The assumption is made that the formulation of relations as
independent components (IC) is a main feature of computations
accomplished by the brain.  Further, it is assumed that memory traces
made of non-orthonormal ICs make use of feedback architectures to form
internal representations. Feedback then leads to delays and delays in
cortical processing form an obstacle to this relational processing.
The problem of delay compensation is formulated as a speed-field tracking
task and is solved by a novel control architecture. It is shown that in
addition to delay compensation the control architecture can also shape
long term memories to hold independent components if a two-phase
operation mode is assumed. Features such as a trisynaptic loop and
a recurrent collateral structure at the second stage of that loop emerge
in a natural fashion. Based on these properties a functional model of the
hippocampal loop is constructed.
