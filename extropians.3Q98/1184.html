<p>
Since the roton is essentially a helicopter with rockets, it can complete
autogyro maneuvers and can land in any patch of field in an emergency, while a
shuttle requires a specially built 10,000 foot runway with twice the normal
concrete thickness. A shuttle lands at over 250 miles per hour, so if it loses a
landing gear, they are basically screwed unless they ditch at sea.Mike Lorrey
