<p>
I'm an idiot...  HERE's the best argument against AI critics:

<p>
AI's goal is not to create an artificial soul, but to create artificial
<br>
*intelligence*, which is a very different concept.  Intelligence can be<br>
defined purely in terms of behavior: the ability to problem-solve, respond
to stimuli and/or coordinate its efforts with other intelligent beings. 
If the AI project builds a computer that can do these things, then it will
have succeeded; *appearing* to act intelligently should not depend on the
soul, unless it is somehow necessary for problem-solving.  Arguably, the
best test for AI is the Turing test: does it behave so much like a person
that another person is fooled?

<p>
There is a great deal of evidence that intelligent behavior CAN be
exhibited by artificial constructs; that we will create a device which
will respond to stimuli so convincingly that we will have no way to tell
the difference between the robot's behavior and a person's behavior.  Even
if this construction does not have a soul, it WILL be intelligent; if so,
AI will have worked.

<p>
Good point about cryonics and NDEs; between that and the point about
frozen zygotes I think we've answered the question for AIs and cryonics.

<p>
As for uploading...  see that rather copious thread in its numerous
incarnations over the years.  IMO, we've yet to answer that question well
enough to satisfy *ourselves*, (sorry to those on both sides who think
the other side is obviously wrong! :p) so I should hardly think that we'll
be able to answer it well in a short FAQ answer.
