First-ever Nanotechnology Venture Offers Investment
Opportunity in Cutting-Edge Startups Developing Molecular 
Assemblers and Assembler Dependent Products 

<p>
NEW YORK, Aug. 28 /PRNewswire/ -- NanoTechnology Development Corporation 
(NTDC) today announced its first public stock offering in New York State. 
NTDC is the world's first public venture uniquely focused on developing 
molecular machine technology. 

<p>
To the company's knowledge, this represents the first opportunity for 
investors to purchase stock directly in a nanotechnology company across 
the World Wide Web. The corporate website with information on NTDC is 
<a href="http://DevelopNanotechnology.com/#overview">http://DevelopNanotechnology.com/#overview</a>. 

<p>
NTDC funds scientists and startup companies engaged in developing 
Molecular Nanotechnology (MNT) as defined by Dr. K. Eric Drexler of 
the Foresight Institute, Palo Alto, CA. Feasible design approaches 
for nanotechnology include "Bottom Up" (building directly with atoms) 
and "Top Down" (component miniaturization) approaches. 

<p>
Applications for nanotechnology include the development of nanoscopic 
supercomputers with atomic dimension components, atomically assembled 
diamondoid super composites, programmable self-replicating machinery 
and products only possible with nanotechnology offering unique benefits 
for biotechnology, medicine and a wide range of other industries. 

<p>
<a name="1980qlink1">The stated goal of NTDC is to develop a "Molecular Assembler" -- a 
microscopic device capable of self-replication and programmable atomic 
precision chemistry for use in molecular manufacturing, starting with 
NTDC's "Top Down" approach, "Fractal Shape Shifting Robots" theoretically 
</a>
<a name="1980qlink2">capable of scaling down to the molecular realm. Near term first 
generation Robot applications include programmed heavy construction, 
without traditional labor.
