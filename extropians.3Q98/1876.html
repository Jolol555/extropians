<a href="1875.html#1876qlink1">&gt; Perhaps this is old hat to everyone here.  Maybe not.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When I was in an intro to philosophy class in Mississippi, the class</i><br>
<i>&gt; was full of Bible Belt Believers most of whom were fundamentalists. </i><br>
<i>&gt; They took the bible literaly and were consumed in their faith.  What</i><br>
<i>&gt; they were doing in a philosophy class, I'm not sure.  I guess they</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought it would be an "easy A".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, the professor brought half the class to tears with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; following (heavily paraphrased):</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's assume God to be the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Omnipotent - all powerful</i><br>
<i>&gt; Omnibenevolent - all good, incapable of evil</i><br>
<i>&gt; Omniscient - all knowing</i><br>
<i>&gt; (The class agrees)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This argument also assumes the existence of good and bad, which I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; not too sure about.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now let's picture a baby and a three year old all alone in the middle</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a dark forrest.  Suddenly a wolf leaps out of the shadows and eats</i><br>
<i>&gt; the infant.  The three year old screams and runs away.  Can we blame</i><br>
<i>&gt; the three year old?  Of course not, there was nothing he could do.  He</i><br>
<i>&gt; was powerless.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, assume the same situation, but this time instead of a three year</i><br>
<i>&gt; old, it's a 16 year old boy.  Again the wolf leaps out and eats the</i><br>
<i>&gt; baby.  The 16 year old was terrified and frozen in his tracks.  Should</i><br>
<i>&gt; we get mad at the 16 year old?  Probably not, but couldn't he have at</i><br>
<i>&gt; least picked up a stick and tried to scare off the wolf?  Maybe, but I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think most people would give him the benifit of the doubt.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, this time replace the boy with a very strong grown man who knows</i><br>
<i>&gt; all about wolves.  This man is armed with a high powered rifle and</i><br>
<i>&gt; several pistols.  He's been attacked by wolves before and has</i><br>
<i>&gt; succesfuly fought them all off.  He's a bad ass.  Again, the wolf</i><br>
<i>&gt; jumps out and eats the baby right in front of this heavily armed man -</i><br>
<i>&gt; he had time to shoot, but did nothing.  Should we blame him?  Hell</i><br>
<i>&gt; yes!  He could and should have saved the baby.  We might even say his</i><br>
<i>&gt; indecision was "bad."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, replace the man with our all powerful, all good, all knowing God.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The baby gets eaten and God does nothing.  Should we blame him?  He</i><br>
<i>&gt; saw the wolf coming and knew what he was going to do and could,</i><br>
<i>&gt; according to our definition, stop it.  Our "God" is also all good, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; how can he let this happen?  Obviously there is something wrong with</i><br>
<i>&gt; our definition of God.  Or perhaps with good.  If God isn't all good</i><br>
<i>&gt; or all powerful or all knowing, is he worthy of our mindless worship?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I certainly don't claim to be a philosopher or even particularly</i><br>
<i>&gt; clever, but this argument was probably the single most important thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; that led me away from my irrational beliefs and "faith."  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I present it here just as my $0.02 worth in the ongoing discussion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<a name="1888qlink1">I mention to them that I object to christianity on moral grounds, 
being opposed to incest.  When they inquire what I mean, I reply by 
asking, "Who were the parents of Adam &amp; Eve's grandchildren?"
