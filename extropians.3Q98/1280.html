The problem with introducing super intelligence software is related not only to
having the right hardware catalyst but more importantly as recent attempts show to
the political costs involved. The unexpected scuttling of the super scalable
Ingrid project at NTT in Japan is a case in point. My guess is that the main
competitor is the pre-existing neural network of hidden weights called money and
Japan's basic about-face strategy at the ending of the age of hypotheses might be
as follows.

<p>
Let a synthesized wholesale abandonment of the current economic system happen in a
way that has been carefully thought about and planned, where Japan's gift to the
world's poor is new technology and education in subjective methods of valuation.
This will embody a capitulation to lifetime learning and self evaluation, with
sustainable reassurance of what can be provided. Cyberspace will create a context
of mutuality by having an open honest discussion, provide feedback in a timely and
appropriate way, and hold its dialectic accountable for doing what needs to be
done to ensure everyone's well-being. Privacy will be on a need to know basis
satisfying the needs of those who wish to know. Once everyone has caught up with
this super intelligence singularity and re-evaluated everything, Cyberspace
awareness will obsolete national security.

<p>
The Japanese will eclipse the world in the meticulous fabricating of an inclusive
non-verbal appendage as the basis for explicit electronic dialogue. Japan's gift
of cooperation in the virtual world will be without any commitment to those who
have given earlier. This era of the Internet will signal the end of reciprocity.
