 yes, I tend to agree - I disagree that all gun carrying people would only
shoot "bad guys" - that's a hoot.
<br>
Hell, maybe I have just watched too much TV..
but I think people in general- armed for protection -  would be far more
responsible with guns (at least per capita- I don't have the "data" on this
but I remember reading something in the seventies - a researched psychological
profile about cops that suggested they weren't the best socially balanced
individuals.)
<br>
Plus the cops- just like the FBI and the Army,  have their "good ol boy"
routine - and a system of dont tell - they  hold themselves above the laws and
the citizenship and aren't as responsible for their actions as a private
citizens
<br>
(defending themselves) would be... 

<p>
So we better hope not only feds have guns!!

<a name="0240qlink1">This does not mean I support an agenda that gun-activists seem to - which is
"more guns per capita" - I am still "anti-gun" - and would like to live in a 
gun-free society -  and I will never buy a gun under the social  conditions
and safety I enjoy here in Los Angeles (yeah yeah you wimps prolly think it's
dangerous, hear - go on, I was born in NYC -  and guns don't have much effect
on fires, landslides or earthquakes).  

<p>
 Still, I 100% support the right to own</a> one, in fact you better - if you live
in a war zone like East LA or Harlem - or even if you feel  that way inclined,
even them good ol boy redneck racist fellas that like the NEA boys.

They gotta find some way to feel safe while their little freakshow of white
