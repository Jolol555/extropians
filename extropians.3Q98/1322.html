<a name="1324qlink1">I think that the main reason for me having trouble getting into a
relationship lately is that I work so much! I think a lot of extropians
male and female alike are in very highly intensive creative fields. It
may be that we just don't have the time. I personally have kind of been
looking for someone I could work with artistically, kill two birds with
one stone. I'm really not so much going for looks, although I respect
someone who takes good care of themselves.
