I can't cite you demographic studies.  But it seems pretty obvious to me
that a typical couple in Bologna Italy, where the average kids/couple 
is .8, would have more long-run progeny if they had eight kids.  Yes 
their immediate factor of ten gain would be mitigated by those kids
each having fewer progeny.  Going to less expensive schools, having less
direct time with parents, having less money for fashionable clothes, etc.
would likely make them less successful in finding mates and gaining 
resources to raise them.  But I find it very hard to believe they'd 
suffer anything like a factor of ten.
