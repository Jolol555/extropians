 Significantly higher compared to what? My guess is 1 or 2 percent of
Microsoft's sales would be enough.

 Microsoft's profits are high enough compared to its needs that a decrease
of a few percent wouldn't have had any effect on its growth.

 This clearly doesn't follow from a change in enforcement funding, so I
suspect you are mixing in unspecified additional assumptions.
