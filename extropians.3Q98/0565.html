Ummm, perhaps I should be discussing Paranoid Personality Disorders.  Let me
first address your last statement.  The government doesn't diagnose (or
using your term "brand") people with the APD label.  Psychologists and
Psychiatrists do.  Most of your objections (strained as they were in their
attempt to trivialize) related to the subjective nature of the criteria I
listed above.  You're absolutely right, diagnosis is quite subjective.
Deciding whether an individual meets any particular criterion is a matter of
clinical judgement by a trained professional.  It's common for people to see
a little bit of themselves in the above description.   Psychologists
consider pervasiveness, chronicity and severity before they recognize the
presence of psychopathology however.

<p>
I'm not very interested in this gun debate but I will make a couple points.

<p>
(1)  Defending yourself and your family (or your neighbor for that matter)
using lethal force against criminals who threaten your safety is fine by me.
I'm not anti-gun.  It just doesn't get rid of the criminal mind.  Pro-gun
activists argue that criminals are going to successfully repress deep,
ingrained personality traits because they'll be afraid the victim may be
armed.  Let's say they're right.  O.K. so what do you do if you have an
antisocial personality?  Override all the genetic and biochemical
directives, forget the negative experiences and influences of the past,
become a respectable citizen, and get a job at Wendy's?  I don't think so.
The criminal mind doesn't disappear just because you point a gun at it or
put it in prison.  It will find a way to manifest because that is its
nature.

<p>
(2)  I'm not sure what the best course would be if we had the fine-tuned
ability to reliably enhance a personality by attenuating urges to act in
ways that harm others.  What if we identify a high risk individual at 3
years of age?  If the parent says it's OK should we intervene and prevent
the formation of a dysfunctional personality?  What about an APD who has
been imprisoned for repeated robberies or murder?  Could we give him the
option of staying in prison for life or undergoing treatment and having a
shot at a more extropic and rewarding way of life?

<p>
Enough,

<p>
Scott
