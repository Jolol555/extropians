other

<a href="1781.html#1813qlink5">&gt; &gt;copies  the last 10 hours of their life was heading for a dead end</a><br>
and a

<i>&gt; exactly as a person with amnesia might.  If you begin by </i><br>
<i>&gt; assuming that they are *not* the same person, then all of </i><br>

on this thread, I believe the majority of extropians/transhumanists
either accept this definition of identity while denying the logical

fundamental to what I thought was  extropianism/transhumanism, I now
wonder if there should be another ism that includes this definition of
identity and its logical conclusions in its principles/statement of
purpose.  Although, I would much prefer these two ism, who both tout
uploading, to stand up, pronounce, and explain some of its counter
intuitive conclusions.  Otherwise, converts will be left on their own
capacity to grapple with these issues, usually with very confusing and
inconsistent results.  This can be disorienting to say the least.  So
