<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; On this subject, I'm toying with a low-budget movie idea about the real</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; perils of duplication (i.e. that the copies are exact duplicates of you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and won't do all those neat things you planned); does anyone know of any</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; movies which have handled this properly in the past? That is, where</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the duplicates really are exact duplicates rather than different versions</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of the same person? Everything I can think of seems to have gone the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 'Jekyll and Hyde' route.             Mark.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

try
<br>
<a href="1696.html#1707qlink12">&gt;out the old issues of 'calvin and hobbes'. calvin made duplicates to make</a><br>
his
<br>
<a href="1696.html#1707qlink13">&gt;homework for him and well..., you can imagine the rest.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;maybe what we need to make uploading work is to make the duplicates more</i><br>
perfect

<a href="1696.html#1707qlink14">&gt;than us. e.g. 'would we trust our work to be done by ourselves?'</a><br>

I think the movie title was Multiplicity or something like it.

<p>
Anyway, you guys are probably right, and as I think about it, I would be
much less interested in limiting the lifespan/consciousness of any copy of
myself (or anyone else) and much more interested in figuring out how to
assimilate knowledge from others' experiences.
