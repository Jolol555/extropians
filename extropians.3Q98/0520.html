However, according to Gary Kleck's research the deterrent effect works 
both ways; criminals are deterred from attacking people with guns, but
also criminals with guns are deterred from physical attacks because the 
guns are likely to kill if used. A criminal with a gun is less likely to 
use it than a criminal with a knife... and a criminal with a non-lethal 
weapon like this will just shoot you from cover then rob you, rape you
or whatever and run away.

<p>
So non-lethal weapons may *increase* the crime rate, not reduce it. Unless
you're miraculously going to prevent criminals getting them... but if you 
could do that we could do it with normal guns too.
