<a href="2105.html#2187qlink1">&gt; It has become quite a dogma (on this list) that self organisation in</a><br>
<i>&gt; spontaneous systems is the best way to do most things. I can certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand the fascination with this way of thinking.</i><br>

<p>
The extropian principles doesn't say that (at least not 2.6, I seem to
recall that the 3.0 draft is a bit stronger), but I have also noted
that many get a bit carried away about SO. It is good and useful, but
not always applicable.

<p>
"Top-down" and "Bottom-up" solutions both have their place, the trick
is to discover which works best for a given situation. That is really
the big question underlying (say) the capitalism debate, and could
probably be resolved with a lot less emotional heat being dissipated
if treated as a problem in understanding the system (not that I think
it is a simple problem). In some cases it is clear that one works
well, sometimes combinations might be useful (local top-down
solutions, or perhaps a planned system containing reserve pockets of
diversity?). This is really an area that can be developed - I wonder
what has been done in it?


<p>
<a href="2105.html#2187qlink2">&gt; It's the kind of fascination that makes some computergames so great.</a><br>
<i>&gt; "Boulder Dash", "Lemmings", "Command &amp; Conquer", "Sim City" and others.</i><br>

<p>
:-) Your'e right, all the best games are in some sense
self-organizing. Most likely they are great because they are complex,
the SO creates surprises which doesn't occur in non-organizing games.

<p>
<a href="2105.html#2187qlink3">&gt; Especially in politics and economics spontanious order and the invisible</a><br>
<i>&gt; hand is hot. But if the free market is the answer to most economical and</i><br>
<i>&gt; political problems, then it's a bit like saying that intelligence has little</i><br>
<i>&gt; value. If simple interconnected systems can perform wel in complex</i><br>
<i>&gt; enviroments why the have intelligence done so well until now.</i><br>

<p>
Because intelligence is able to "jump ahead", finding stuff that the
simple systems have trouble discovering. A computer can search for a
solution to an equation by brute force, but I can find an elegant
proof (sometimes). A market consisting of simple, stupid actors is
likely less useful as a market of smart actors.

<p>
<a href="2105.html#2187qlink4">&gt; Then my question is, at what level will spontanious order work best?</a><br>

<p>
Exactly. How do we find out?
