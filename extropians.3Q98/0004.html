I doubt that cosmetic surgery (unless very extensive) will interfere
the least with any reasonable life extension treatment. The reason is
that life extension programs have to deal with the underlying causes
of aging, and they are definitely not in the dermis and connective
tissues, but something more fundamental. Surgery is of course slightly
dangerous and somewhat stressful on the body, but that stress seems to
be rather minor over the long run (partially offset by improved self
esteem?); after all, our bodies heal much worse damage.

<p>
As for drugs, then things get trickier. There I think it is best to
stay on the cautious side, one should ideally only use the drugs that
are really necessary and use mental or bodily techniques to replace
the others. But of course, this depends on the drug, many of them are
well-tested and the side effects well known.

A good idea. One shouldn't just use every available option, it is
important to see how they fit together. This is of course very hard,
but at least some problems can be identified and dealt with by
forethought.

&gt; important biochemical interactions?  The real fact is, without entropy,<br>

<p>
I think you miss the point of cryonics. If you are lying in liquid
nitrogen, you don't live at all, you are frozen solid. It is intended
as a last resort if current medical science cannot keep you alive. As
life extension goes, it is currently a shot in the dark.
