<a href="0202.html#0313qlink1">&gt; I find it helpful to talk about some 'exotic' technology in conjunction</a><br>
<i>&gt; with a present technology that was considered exotic in the recent past.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For instance, I was talking to a family member about a recent article I</i><br>
<i>&gt; read on one company's research into bioimplants of personal computers. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; jokingly stated that I would be the first on line to receive such an</i><br>
<i>&gt; implant. He said I was crazy and didn't think it would ever happen. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; had him recall watching StarTrek as a child and how exotic personal</i><br>
<i>&gt; handheld communicators seemed back then. Now even he is getting a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cell-phone!</i><br>

<p>
This strategy can be useful, but note that it can be used to defend
just about anything:<a name="0342qlink1"> "Nobody thought heavier-than-air flying was
possible, so why can't antigravity be possible?".</a> It is even better if
you can point at some sources that support you, that grounds the
argument even more strongly in reality. 

<p>
Today wearable computers are as silly to most as star trek
communicators; there is a good chance next generation is going to grow
up with them.
