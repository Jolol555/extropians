Abstract
<br>
  C57BL/6J (B/6J) mice are genetically predisposed to become overweight and
  develop hyperglycemia if raised on a high fat diet. The purpose of the
  present study was to explore the effect of dietary supplementation of
  L-glutamine (Gln), an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, on
  the development of hyperglycemia and excessive weight gain. Groups of 10 ageand
   weight-matched male B/6J mice were raised on one of four diets: 1) a low
  fat, low sucrose (LL), studied separately, 2) a high fat, low sucrose (HL)
  diet alone, 3) high fat, low sucrose supplemented with
  L-glutamine (HL+Gln) and 4) high fat, low sucrose
  supplemented with L-alanine (HL+Ala). Energy intake, body weight, plasma
  glucose and insulin concentrations were monitored over time. We found no
  difference in energy intake per unit body weight between any groups after the
  first 2 wk of feeding. However, the mean +/- SEM for body weight (27.1 +/-
  0.6 g) of the LL group measured at 16 wk was lower (P &lt; 0.05) than that of
  the HL group at 37.9 +/- 1.9 g. Also, after 5.5 mo, the mean +/- SEM for
  plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in the LL group of mice were 6.9
  +/- 0.4 mmol/l and 146 +/- 30 pmol/l, which were lower (P &lt; 0.05) than those
  in the HL group at 10.1 +/- 0.9 mmol/l and 438 +/- 84 pmol/l, respectively.
  Although both amino acids caused a 10% reduction (P &lt; 0.05) in body weight
  compared with HL feeding at wk 16, only Gln supplementation resulted in
  persistent reductions in both plasma glucose and insulin concentrations over
  5.5 mo. In another experiment, when Gln was added to the high fat (HL) diet
  of heavy hyperglycemic animals for 2 mo, body weight gain, hyperglycemia and
  hyperinsulinemia were attenuated. In conclusion, supplementing
  glutamine to a high fat diet reduces body weight and
  attenuated hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in B/6J mice.
