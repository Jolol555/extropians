<p>
I'm not sure what you mean here.  I suspect we've been reading very
different books.  :)

<p>
Most of the so-called "many worlds" scenarios that I'VE heard of tend to
posit that all logically possible worlds exist, which on some level renders
*everything* irrelevent.  Is that what you're referring to?

<a href="2030.html#2031qlink8">&gt;As to how and why AI will influence the accounting business, several comments</a><br>

<i>&gt;cumbersome hidden layers, the invisible hand of capitalism, etc.)</i><br>
Capitalism is
<br>

times of
<br>
<a href="2030.html#2031qlink12">&gt;inferior data gathering concepts.</a><br>

<p>
So a "superior" form of neural network (unsupervised, presumably?) would be
coordinated by/with/through AI?  I take it you're presuming that AI will
come in the form of a neural-like network or some other complex information
processor.  The impression I'm getting then is that people will turn on the
Internet-or-something to find out what they need to do today (possibly
wiring straight into the wet ware so that they're actually thinking with
the net themselves).  Am I close so far?

<p>
I have no clear idea at all what this sentance means.
Relativity/clustering techniques?  Are you referring to the way in which
income equality is measured?  There's a lot of different people and ways of
thinking that call themselves "connectionist."  What do YOU mean here?

<p>
<a href="2030.html#2031qlink15">&gt;In economics it is the loss of transactional binding caused by the</a><br>

What sort of binding are you referring to here?  I'm not aware of Brin
approaching a problem like what you're describing.
