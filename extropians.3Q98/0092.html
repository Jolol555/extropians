Me:
<br>
<a href="0081.html#0092qlink1">&gt; It's an extropian meme in the US perhaps, due to necessity reasons</a><br>
(not
<br>
<a href="0081.html#0092qlink2">&gt; that I would know - I've never lived in the US). I would argue that it isn't</a><br>
in
<br>
<a href="0081.html#0092qlink3">&gt; coutries with more stringent gun laws (and, maybe consequently,</a><br>
lower
<br>
<a href="0081.html#0092qlink4">&gt; death rates due to violent crime).  Looking in from the outside, it</a><br>
appears
<br>
<a href="0081.html#0092qlink5">&gt; to me that the US has found itself in a self-induced positive feedback</a><br>
<i>&gt; condition.  Preventing a country or region from entering this worrying</i><br>
<i>&gt; state appears to be a more rational course of action - though if you're</i><br>
in
<br>
<a href="0081.html#0092qlink6">&gt; a country lilke the US you may not have much choice but to choose gun</a><br>
<i>&gt; ownership.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0085.html#0092qlink7">&gt;Looking at the rest of the world from the inside of this 'positive</a><br>
<i>&gt;feedback condition', I can proudly say that, YES, it is 'self-induced', not</i><br>
<i>&gt;government induced, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with</i><br>
<i>&gt;positive feedback when it comes to human liberty. "Extremism in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;defense of liberty is no vice".... Since extropianism places freedom of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the individual and responsibility of the individual on the highest pedestal,</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropians who beleive in the rights of the individual should look at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;US as being closer to the goal of Unlimited Individual Freedom than most</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the rest of the world, at least when it comes to defense/protection of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the individual. Since most of the rest of the world lives in a situation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;government totalitarianism when it comes to gun ownership, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;situation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;'necessity' exists in those other countries, rather than in the US, since</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropians living in other countries must temper their beleifs for fear of</i><br>
<i>&gt;conflicting with their local cultural/societal/governmental mores, or being</i><br>
<i>&gt;found to be in need of 'reeducation' and 'socialization' in their countries</i><br>
<i>&gt;penal systems....</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0118qlink1">OK, OK .......... it seems you took the term 'prevent' to mean some form of
government, or external, control - which is not what I meant.  Look at it
from a societal and personal point of view. Personally, I would rather be
a member of a society where the  * individuals* eschew gun-toting
radicalism.<a name="0110qlink1">  For example, here in NZ the police don't wear guns, and the
NZ society (ie. the summation of individuals) is generally wary of gun
ownership.  Most individuals can apply for a gun licence (and will
probably get it), its just that most *don't want to* - because *as
individuals* they have already seen the effects in the US - and its not a
pretty sight.
