<p>
Me too.  I'll start...

<p>
I just scanned through the principles, searching for debate topics.  I can
only find one issue worth discussing, it is the only problem I have ever
had with the principles, and it has been discussed before:

<p>
It is the conflict between Boundless Expansion &amp;&amp; (Intelligent Technology
&amp;&amp; Spontaneous Order)  The question is, Boundless Expansion for whom?

<p>
All it takes is an intelligent AI with a life goal of wiping out the
surface of our planet with a chain of nuclear explosions, and no one will
be Boundlessly Expanding anywhere.  Is this AI not the perfect example of
IT and SO-- the product of technological progress, free-market access to
uranium, and a robo-hacker's unregulated tinkerings?  How do you defeat a
robot with global kamakazi urges and nuclear know-how?

<p>
One argument I have heard is that defensive technology will always out-run
offensive technology.(following the parallel of encryption/decryption)
Sounds nice... maybe "Star Wars" could fire their lasers at the
robo-nukes.  Of course, "Star Wars" was not designed to handle a
robot that can readily obtain the components of a nuclear weapon, assemble
them in its Los Angeles appartment, and detonate the nuke right there.

<p>
I think there are two questions that come out of this paranoid line of
reasoning:


<OL>
  <li>  Is this scenario any more likely than getting struck by lightning?
  <li>  If (yes), what can we do to prevent it?


</OL>
<p>
My answers at the moment:


<OL>
  <li>  yes, thunderstorms are rare in Vancouver
  <li>  get out of this gravity well as fast as we can


</OL>
<p>
My answers follow the Extropian principles, but they're not satisfying.

<p>
I just don't buy this common assumption that AI's will be looking out for
our best interests at all times.  How can we regulate them without
regulating humans beings and all the time maintaining our
prized "spontaneous order"?


<p>
Geoff.
