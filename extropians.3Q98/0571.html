<p>
Thanks, Nick, for your effort in getting a renewed FAQ started.  I think some
of the questions obviously overlap and/or are redundant.  Accordingly, my
comments here are aimed at regrouping the questions and perhaps rephrasing
them to cover the areas of overlap.

<p>
&gt; What is transhumanism?

<p>
That's the best first question and the answer to which we should work the
hardest at making economical an to the point.  As I mentioned before, Anders
has boiled out mot of the dross in his introductory definition, but something
even shorter may be possible.
  
<p>
&gt;  What is a posthuman?<br>


<p>
I would list this as the second question and, again, vote in favor of the most
pointed and economical response.

<p>
I think the next questions should relate to the "unnatural" and "human nature"
issues, which go to the heart of what distinguishes transhumanism from other,
similar ideas and philosophies:

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink1">&gt;  Isn't transhumanism tampering with nature?</a><br>
<i>&gt;  Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?</i><br>

<p>
Continuing the theme of definition by distinction, the following questions
follow naturally from the "nature" issues:

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink2">&gt;  What makes transhumanism different from other philosophies, movements,</a><br>
<i>&gt;  or religions?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Isn't transhumanism old hat? Sure, it's a new name, but basically,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  hasn't the philosophy been around a long time?</i><br>

<p>
These actually may be conflated into a single question:

<p>
What are transhumanism's philosophical and cultural antecedents, and how is it
distinguished from other, similar ideas?

<p>
Having distinguished our ideas from those of other thinkers, we should
advertise our intellectual credentials:

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink3">&gt;  What prominent thinkers are associated with transhumanism? (This is</a><br>
<i>&gt;  not the same as "Who is prominent within transhumanism?")</i><br>

<p>
An aside from this point (but one well worth addressing), is the "cult"
question sometimes encountered:

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink4">&gt;  Is transhumanism a cult/religion?</a><br>

<p>
I am less enamored of the following question:

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink5">&gt;  Do you believe in God?</a><br>

<p>
which, to maintain linguistic parallelism, should be rephrased as:

<p>
Do transhumanists believe in God?

<p>
I think anyone who is asking this question by this point has probably missed
the import of the material they would already have encountered in the FAQ.
Making this a separate question invites taking the answer to it out of context
its use in negative propaganda.  SO I would vote against inclusion of this
question.

<p>
<a name="0638qlink1">I am more ambivalent about the following question:

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink6">&gt;  There is a non-physical soul and therefore some transhumanist issues</a><br>
<i>&gt;  are bound to fail (uploading, conscious AI)</i><br>

<p>
First, I would rephrase it: 

<p>
Won't things like uploading, cryonics and AI fail because they can't preserve
or create the soul?</a>

<p>
If folks want to include it, I'd like to have some input into the answer,
having had a lifetime of experience of memetic guerrilla warfare in the Bible
Belt.

<p>
The next questions all relate to "Life Extension" and should be grouped
together:
  
<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink7">&gt;  Why do you want to live longer?</a><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Isn't death part of the natural order of things?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Won't extended lifespans cause overpopulation problems?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0583qlink1">The next set of questions deal with social and political issues, and I would
group them together under a title indicating their common theme:</a>

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink8">&gt;  Won't new technologies only benefit the rich and powerful? What</a><br>
<i>&gt;  happens to the rest?</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink9">&gt;  Shouldn't we concentrate on current problems like improving the</a><br>
<i>&gt;  condition of the poor people or solving international conflicts,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  instead of putting effort into foreseeing the "far" future?</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink10">&gt;  What kind of society would posthumans live in?</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink11">&gt;  These new technologies will be used in war and may cause our</a><br>
<i>&gt;  extinction.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink12">&gt;  How will superintelligent machines treat us humans?</a><br>

<pre>
	(I would rephrase this as follows:
	How will posthumans or superintelligent machines 
	treat humans who aren't augmented?)

</pre>
<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink13">&gt;  So you think technology will solve all problems?</a><br>



<p>
The last set of questions relate to practicalities and progress in the
transhumanist program:

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink14">&gt;  What evidence is there that it will happen?</a><br>
 
<p>
&gt;  What is nanotechnology?<br>

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink15">&gt;  All these transhumanist issues will not happen within a hundred years,</a><br>
<i>&gt;  they will take more like a thousand years. (MNT, Uploading)</i><br>
 
<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink16">&gt;  What if it doesn't work?</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink17">&gt;  How could I become a posthuman?</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink18">&gt;  The possibility of success (in cryonics) is too small.</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink19">&gt;  Will the people of the future be interested in restoring you?</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink20">&gt;  What recent progress has been made towards transhumanist goals?</a><br>

<p>
The last question,

<p>
<a href="0569.html#0571qlink21">&gt;  Oh well... (Person sort of agrees in an intellectual way but doesn't</a><br>
<i>&gt;  take it to heart)</i><br>

<p>
I would rephrase in more positive terms:

<p>
How can I become involved in transhumanism?
