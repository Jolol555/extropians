Dodge City was a lawless frontier. Modern American cities are places 
where because of the population density, there are high 
concentrations of criminals. These criminals, because of their 
nature, tend to ignore 'gun control' laws such as the Brady Bill, and 
purchase their arms from the black market, or steal them.

<p>
In cities where concealed carry laws are in effect (Florida and 
Texas) there is a lower incidence of violent crime than in cities 
that prohibit law abiding people from even owning a gun (Chicago and 
Washington DC).

<p>
The armed citizen is nothing to fear; he is civilized and will not 
start shooting unless there is no other way to defend himself. The 
disarmed citizen is at the mercy of the criminals, and possibly, of 
the police state that will inevitably evolve to cope with them.

<p>
Concealed carry laws restrict the right to carry to those who meet 
several tests of behavior and training. There are plenty of laws on 
the books to deal with the very few who obtain a permit and abuse 
their right.

<p>
If all stable, intelligent people carried a gun at all times, the 
incidence of violent crime would plummet, because all but the most 
stupid of criminals would realize they are playing Russian roulette 
by attempting to commit crimes.
