TriStateF@aol.com asked:

<p>
<a href="1308.html#1344qlink1">&gt; Why do women find transhumanism to be unappealing?  Someone please</a><br>
<i>&gt; explain.</i><br>

<p>
	I have the same question.

<p>
	There also seems to be other sides to such differences between
men and women.  Take the Mormons for example.  Now this is a real full
of women church.  For some reason, it seems to me, women just go for
that kind of stuff, as much or more so as do men go for extropianism.
Why do women find mormonism so appealing?  LDS men have quite the
choice of any women they want.  The fact that there were so many more
mormon women than men is part of the reason for polygamy in mormonism.
Would the chance to have multiple "hot babes" doting over you be an
incentive?  For a time even I tried to be the kind of LDS Guy all the
women seemed to want.

<p>
	Also, it seems women are much more capable of pulling men in
their direction than is the reverse.  You constantly see "hot babes"
dating non mormon men, converting them, getting them baptized, and
then marrying them.  I don't see many women converting to extropiansim
to marry some man.  Also don't forget that the hand that rocks the
cradle rules the world...

<p>
	Then there is me and my wife, having both been raised as
mormons.  My wife is about as mormon as they come while I, being a
natural extropian from birth, could never quite understand all, what
was to me, the hogwash mormons constantly spout.  Since there are so
many extropian men and mormon women, I guess some of us must just
intermarry and learn how to get along.  It's a bit hard at times but I
think it can work.  Now if I could just succeed at having as much
influence over our children as my wife does.
