Uh, Roton is a supposedly low-maintenance SSTO; using rotors significantly
reduces the mass because you don't have to carry a lot of fuel to use for
the landing. A very large part of the cost of government launchers is the
cost of assembling the numerous stages, testing them, building parts with
extremely low probability of failure and then throwing them all away.

<p>
An SSTO can in principle be much cheaper because it's not thrown away, it
can land if there's an in-flight failure, and all you need to do to fly
it again is tow it to the launch pad, run the pre-flight checks and 
hook up the fuel lines. Obviously with a first-generation it's not going
to be as simple as flying a modern jet, but it should be much simpler
than any expendable launch vehicle in operation today.

<p>
So the rotors are a minor point except to the extent that they make it
a workable SSTO.

As far as I'm aware the shuttle's wings add a large amount to the cost 
and weight.
