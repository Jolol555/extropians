This is a very good point, and one I also use in discussing transhumanism with
people.  I often ask people to think about the major changes in world view and
lifestyle that happened in the last half of the 18th century and point out
parallels between our own time and the Enlightenment.  It often gets people to
focus on the fact that that some periods in history DO involve fundamental
change and that this just might be one of them.
