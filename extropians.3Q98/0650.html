<a name="0659qlink1">I submit that #2 and #3 are the exact same scenario for our world.  No
atom will be different, no action will be changed.  By all measurements
and laws of physics, the person on our world in scenario #2 and #3
experience the exact same fate, atom per atom.  Yet you interpret these
identical fates differently.</a>  The fate of these people have always been
interpreted as death throughout all time.  Even<a name="0659qlink2"> in scenario #2 you
</a>
interpret it as death.  Now, suddenly, you are changing the definition
and saying that the exact same event is no longer considered death.  You
are interpreting the death by some mystical definition not relating to
any laws of physics or any scientific measurement of the body to
determine if it is dead.

<p>
The only thing that makes the last scenario acceptable to you is that
you're dead.<a name="0659qlink4">  You seem to think that it is OK for one copy to die if the
other copy lives.</a>  Is it OK for one copy to be horribly crippled in the
murder attempt<a name="0659qlink5"> while the other goes unscathed?</a>  Is it OK for one copy to
be in constant pain, while the other lives pain free?  If not, why would
it be acceptable to diverge these copies by way of death, but not in any
other way.  If the pain or suffering of one bothers you, why doesn't the
death of the same one bother<a name="0659qlink6"> you?  If one of them were in pain, and it
bothered you, would killing it resolve you problem?</a>  Since it is dead,
but you don't count it as dead, does that erase any prior pain and
suffering since it can't remember it?
