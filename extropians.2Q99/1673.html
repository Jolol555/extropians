Actually, the damaging part of the concept isn't the idea "Don't
think--feel!"  The damaging part is the idea that there's a sharp
distinction.  Any information the brain processes is input to
rationality.  That includes instinct, and intuition, and any other data
that gets produced by any cognitive process.

I remember studying for the SAT at age 11.  I took the first Math
practice section and got a 600.  I took the second one and got a 560.  I
took the third one and got a 540.  Going over the problems, I realized
that my first guess, my first impression, was right more often than my
second-guessing; as I tried to compensate by increasing second-guessing,
my scores went down.  So I took another practice test, rapidly and
without self-consciousness, acting, as Obi-Wan would say, "on instinct",
and got a 640.  I figured that was good enough and stopped practicing;
on the eventual SAT a few months later, I got a 740 in Math.  I *trust*
my intuitions, not for any mystical reason, but because they're always right.

My father has a lecture about how Star Trek destroyed American
engineering by teaching managers to say "Dammit, Scotty, I need it done
in five minutes, not two weeks."  I think that Star Trek destroyed
American culture through the Mr. Spock stereotype, that "rational
thinking" is high-precision math incapable of understanding emotions. 
Star Trek is also responsible for the failure of AI, psychiatric idiocy,
Skinnerian behaviorism, string theory, and the hole in the ozone layer,
but I digress.

By comparision, Star Wars's "Use the Force" would simply seem to state
an additional input.  What Lorrey said.

<p>
Of course, I haven't seen Episode I.  I don't think I plan to, since the
nonstop hype has managed to instill feelings of nausea whenever I hear
the words "Star Wars".  If they'd just *released* it, I would have gone
to see it.  As it is, I'd rather see _The Matrix_ a third time.
