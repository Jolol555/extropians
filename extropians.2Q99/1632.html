<a href="1605.html#1632qlink1">&gt;I have re-read everything I have written on this list for the past month,</a><br>
<i>&gt;and I honestly don't understand why so many of you are so upset by what I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have written.  I noticed two or three things I wrote that were meant to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be mildly offensive, but that was in response to what I viewed as extreme</i><br>
<i>&gt;and unfounded hostility towards me.  I would appreciate it if those who</i><br>
<i>&gt;have been offended by me would read over what I have written and let me</i><br>
<i>&gt;know what I did to upset them so much.  I have no wish to be offensive,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and I am quite surprised by the reaction I am getting from many of you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I feel that I have been unjustly accused by many on this list, and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;would appreciate a detailed explanation, based on what I have posted to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the list, of why so many are so upset at me.  I honestly don't know what</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am writing that has offended so many.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1719qlink1">FWIW, you haven't offended me a bit. I don't respond to your statements
because you don't respond to counterpoints. Based on that, debate is
impossible. Besides, all the points you raised are answered in complete
eloquence in both "The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged." If</a> you haven't
<a name="1719qlink2">read these books, I suggest you do. If you have, and you still feel</a> the way
you do, then once again debate is pointless.

<p>
<a name="1719qlink4">As to why you have offended so many, I can only proffer my opinion. You
espouse ideas such as negation of private property and the importance of
society over the individual. To many of us who are on this list, those
concepts are immoral and ultimately evil. It is the same thing as a Jew
getting offended at someone advocating the Holocaust. The ideas of
objectivism, enlightened self-interest, and the importance of private
ownership of poverty are the foundation upon which we live our lives and
seek to influence the future. If you seek to influence the future</a> in other
directions, you cannot expect anything other than for us to combat you at
every turn.

<p>
A few sample quotes of yours:

<p>
<i>&gt;Is it absolutely essential that people</i><br>
<br>
believe in the fictional concept of "property rights" in order to
interact productively and peacefully?

<p>
This is diametrically opposed to libertarian politics and objectivist
philosophy.

<p>
<a href="1272.html#1632qlink2">&gt;I am deeply angry at those who have no respect for others</a><br>

<p>
<a href="1353.html#1632qlink3">&gt;I'm actually not intending to be offensive by the things I am posting on</a><br>
the list.  I come off that way sometimes because I like to push peoples'
buttons especially if there really is no reason for them to be upset
except for their own psychological insecurities.

<p>
Intentially pushing people's buttons is not an act of respect. These two
quotes are contradictions.

<p>
<a href="1344.html#1632qlink4">&gt;Because you are so full of hostility, you do not realize that we actually</a><br>
agree on pretty much everything.

<p>
Your "I am angry" diatribe was full of hostility, yet you use that concept
to dismiss others.

<p>
<i>&gt;Because I am</i><br>
<br>
intelligent, I would use your own deepest desires to change whatever
behaviors I wanted to.

<p>
I don't know what to say other than this statement is about as condescending
as one can get.

<p>
I don't that this feedback will help, but please don't respond unless it's a
point-by-point response that directly addresses my comments.
