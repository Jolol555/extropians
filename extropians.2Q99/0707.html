Has anybody done a thorough analysis of the likely behavior of post
immortality capitalism? How will this affect economies, governments,
citizens? I'm thinking economists, econometrists, someone who's scraped
all the beans into a set of complicated piles, and can justify the
result.

Can everyone get rich?<a name="0718qlink1"> Or will we have the same divide that we
</a>
experience today?<a name="0718qlink2"> Will the first world countries still require a
massive, impoverished third word to support the illusion of utopia?</a>
