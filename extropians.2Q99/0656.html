Many, just not necessarily practical ones.</a>  The problem is
that everything is in different orbits.  No one has figured out
how to use a chunk of debris that flies past every once in
a long while at several thousand meters per second.  I had
a notion at one time of trying to modify the orbit of a piece
of a comet, to place it into earth orbit, then use this large
chunk of ice to capture bits of orbitting debris.  Turns out
this approach is no more practical than the other ideas.  spike
