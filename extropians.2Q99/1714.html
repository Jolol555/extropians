"As in my prior reply, your contention that property rights are a 'fictional
concept'. Property is a concept of Natural Law, and trying to fictionalize
something as real as that is just another meme that the totalitarian forces
use to destroy the rights of the individual. It is evil in every sense of
the word."

<p>
Property rights are not fictional, but I don't think they could rightly be
called a concept of Natural Law.  I offer the Native Americans as an
example, whose egalitarian lifestyle was indicative of the lack of property
rights.  Communism, although a pipe dream, attempted to destroy</a> property
rights, but capitalists are, in my experience, greedy and materialistic.  So
although david_musik was incorrect about property rights being fictitious,
you were also incorrect assuming the extreme opposite, in that property
rights are made necessary by Natural Law.

<a name="1720qlink2">"How have I done that? I did observe that if you practice your rude,
obnoxious, condescending ways of poking people's buttons in real life, I
wouldn't be surprised if you got your nose broken at least once for your
actions. That is not to imply that it would be me doing it. I consider
myself a rather non-violent and non-confrontational person, but I am rather
adamant about defending my own rights. I will not ever shy away from that.
The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. Live free or die, death is not
the worst of evils. No one who values the freedom of the individual need
fear me. Those that don't, do, though.

<a name="1724qlink1">Okay, this has got to stop.  I'm talking about the mudslinging, gentlemen.</a>
I would suggest you read Irvine Welsh's "The Acid House," for one story in
particular, although the title elludes me currently.  I do believe it's
called "Philosophers" or something.  Reminds me of the controlled anger</a> I'm
reading here.  "I wouldn't be surprised if you got your nose broken at least
once," "I and others know now to avoid you for our own safety."  You sound
like animals who understand diplomacy and are just saying enough not to
start a war but to stir each other's blood.  Shake hands, back off, do
whatever you have to do, but stop whining and finger-pointing, and remember
that everyone's opinion matters; maybe not to you, but to at least one
person, they do.  That's all that matters.  For a list touting enlightenment
and tolerance and the advancement of the species, this seems slightly
detrimental to the process and degrading on the whole.  Any problems?
