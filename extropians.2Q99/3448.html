 "Clem, get yer squirrel gun an' let's overthrow the gummint!"  
 Sheesh!  Every time someone puts this specious reasoning forth, it 
 sounds more ridiculous (and don't bring the Swiss up; the main 
 reason the Reich didn't invade them was that the Swiss were hiding 
 their billions in stolen gold for them). &gt;&gt;

I missed the specious reasoning. I thought "Who watches the watchers?" was 
still quite a conundrum for any "-archy" or "-cracy" theory. Could you please 
show us why it isn't? (or what the real specious reasoning was, if I've 
misunderstood)
