<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
Energy transfer by itself is quite satisfactory for energy transfer.

<p>
For matter to escape or rather circumvent space-time, that is
teleportation, and perhaps time travel, or both.

<p>
There might be many things.  This is my view, which is relatively
informed.  Some people say eight dimensions, some say thirteen dimensions,
some say sixteen, some say infinity, others three.  Some people were quite
adamant in maintaining that the Earth is flat.

2010, 4010, what's the difference?  When I say "we" in this paragraph I
mean humanity.

<p>
The statement is not a conditional, in that "Once..." translates to
"When...", as opposed to "If..."  but does not say that techniques and
methodologies will be developed, but will be possible to be developed.
There is some acceptance among physics research circles that dimensions
above four exist.  Measurement would be the first step, for example a rule,
a measure of area, a measure of volume, a clock.

<p>
What I have stated is speculation.  It is not disprovable.  When I find or
determine a proof that there are infinite dimensions, that will be a good
thing.
