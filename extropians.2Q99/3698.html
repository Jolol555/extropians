Cat's Claw for Alzheimer's
<br>
By Paul Rajcok, N.D.

<p>
Alzheimer's patients may soon have another herbal extract to look to for
help. Many already use a standardized extract of ginkgo biloba, and
according to research presented at a gathering of the Federation of
Societies for Experimental Biology (FSEB) in Washington late last year, a
special extract from the popular herb cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa) may
prove to be helpful as well.

<p>
Cat's claw is understood to have anti-inflammatory and immune-stimulating
effects. It is also reported to protect cells from oxidative stress, and the
herb is often used for treating gastrointestinal disease and arthritis. But
according to study results presented at FSEB, cat's claw may block the
formation of a key component of Alzheimer's disease. In their studies,
researchers found that cat's claw inhibited the formation of beta-amyloid
protein in rats. Beta-amyloid is an abnormal arrangement of amyloid
precursor protein and is what actually forms the amyloid plaques that occur
alongside neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
Gotu Kola, 100 Capsules

<p>
The researchers noted that in laboratory studies, the effects of cat's claw
increased when combined with ginkgo, rosemary, and gotu kola. ProteoTech's
extract, PTI-00703, is still in experimental stages, but the company, along
with Rexall-Sundown, is planning human clinical trials on mild-moderate
Alzheimer's patients.
