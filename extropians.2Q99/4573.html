emory.edu... could it be another Atlantan is finally on the list?!

Anyway, don't worry about us group A people taking over the
Earth once we upload and run fast... sure we might take a
few mountains and chunks of oceans for our ships, but I can
personally promise you that I will leave your own atoms alone.

Just don't get hit by any cars while you are waiting on that
neuronal upload process to be perfected.

<i>&gt;         the recent discussion about the problem of identity preservation</i><br>
<i>&gt; during uploading seems very interesting. as someone here pointed out, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; debate divides into two major camps -- A. those who measure identity</i><br>
<i>&gt; through objective observation, and B. those who relie on subjective</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience. along another dimension, the former camp tends to believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt; patterns of information alone can be conscious while the latter tends to</i><br>
<i>&gt; require a chain of causality as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         although i incline toward the latter, i do not believe that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter is arguable either way ... it seems to be a matter of faith.</i><br>
<i>&gt; however, i do see some potential effects of this division which appear</i><br>
<i>&gt; unsettling. it seems to me that uploading patterns of information (say</i><br>
<i>&gt; into a platform-independent software representation) will be much easier</i><br>
<i>&gt; than implementing one-neuron-at-a-time nanosurgery. taking note that group</i><br>
<i>&gt; A. usually have no trouble with pure software while group B. generally</i><br>
<i>&gt; prefer seqential neuron replacements, i fear that one population of</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanists will most likely be uploaded appreciably before the other.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          perhaps i am overly cynical, but i do not like the idea of living</i><br>
<i>&gt; under a population of bona fide "superior" beings. i am not suggesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; that power necessarily brings about corruption and oppression (wait ... it</i><br>
<i>&gt; sounds ... hmmm), but i do expect that increased intellect would bring</i><br>
<i>&gt; about different priorities. what do you think?</i><br>
