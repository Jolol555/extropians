A generalized nonconsensual mind alteration is not equivalent to rape. 
Perhaps someone else could phrase this better, but rape is a traumatic,
mind-damaging experience - for most women - because it strikes at the
heart of their sexual identity, which, for the aforesaid "most women",
is something that they invest a great deal of themselves in.  I don't
know that a more powerful personality would be damaged by rape, any more
than I would be damaged by castration.

<p>
This also gets into the discussion of "sexual harassment" earlier.  It
really is a mistake to assume that, simply because a woman goes out of
her way to make herself more attractive, she wants men to compliment
her.  Part of that may simply be the enforcement of social norms; like
it or not, there are a lot of men (and even women), including bosses and
personnel managers, who don't feel quite comfortable around a woman who
doesn't want to wear makeup, bras, or, God help us, high heels.

<p>
<a name="4734qlink2">More complexly, the evolutionarily optimal sexual strategy for females
isn't as straightforward as that for males.  In the case of males, the
strategy is simple:  Screw everything in sight that you can possibly
impregnate.  In the case of females, who, at minimum, have to spend nine
months pregnant, the strategy is to attract a single mate of the highest
possible quality.  Thus a woman may go out of her way to make herself
more attractive, even out of personal rather than social causes, and
still be looking for a compliment from only one man.</a>

<p>
Sexual exclusivity can become as much a part of the default female
psyche as sexual profligacy can become part of the default male psyche
<br>
("macho").  This is why rape does so much mental damage, and why<br>
castration is so often spoken of as the appropriate punishment for rape.
 It's not a matter of prevention; castration does "the same thing" to
the default male identity that rape does to the default female identity.

<p>
I think that the "general case" of nonconsensual mind alteration is
simply too general; minds are complex things.  The evils you can do to
someone's mind are every bit as general as "evil", period; trying to
define the general case is like trying to define the general case of evil.

<p>
The term "rape" should be reserved for damaging someone's personality by
violating an invariant they value as part of their identity.  For
example, in Spider Robinson's _Time Pressure_, the protagonist puts such
a high value on the integrity of his memories that he feels raped when
they're altered.
