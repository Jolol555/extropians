for that purpose, I'd be VERY suprised if people on this list are 
amongst their number. No-one here is overly interested in dying, when 
it comes down to it, and cryonics is about dying+hope.

I reply:

I just turned thirty, and although these kind's of issues are (I 
hope) not in momentary consideration for me, I have given it thought. 
If the advancing technologies of the future do not aide me in the 
prevention of death or extension of life, I will prepare not a 
gravesite, but a trust in the intellect of man. I will approach 
cryonics. With the awareness that I have in science I doubt I will 
have to deal with this choice, (if all goes well inbetween the 
natural lifespan) but will choose cronics, and will have a better 
chance then the guy who bought a plot in the dirt.
