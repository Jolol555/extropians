<a name="3628qlink1">I don't see guns as in any way empowering the citizenry, rather than
forcing people to confront aggressors, it strikes me as quite easy to
just pull a trigger and kill them.</a>  I would argue that a country where
<a name="3628qlink2">everyone is armed is far less polite than one where people can't just
</a>
blow their problems away.</a>

<a name="3628qlink3"><a name="3519qlink2">And OF COURSE the government is trying to take this "empowerment" away,
that is the entire idea behind police forces, we have highly trained
professionals to apprehend people etc., as opposed to scared, highly
agitated amateurs with powerful weaponry.</a></a>

<p>
What's wrong with hands and feet?</a></a>

<a name="3519qlink4"><i>&gt; or even worse, the very right to defend</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3628qlink5">Now, before this descends into histrionics: are you *really* saying that
people are forbidden to defend themselves when attacked, or is this just
another example of the weird rhetoric which pervades this list?</a></a>
