<a name="0507qlink1">This theory needs to be augmented to explain why the "no organization" 
organization fails.  Across the thousands of stars there is a weak 
organization via trade that doesn't seem to threaten the total</a> human
region.  So why couldn't the same weak ties work within a star's system?
Why couldn't a solar system fragment into thousands of places each of
which was organized internally, but where ties between places were weak?

<p>
<a name="0507qlink2">I'm not yet persuaded of that.  If bio weapons can kill all the 
humans in a star system, why doesn't it spread to other star
systems via the trading ships?  If trading ships can block 
the spread, why can't places within a star's system use the 
same approach?</a></a>
