Please can list members have some sympathy for us poor Brits, and others
around the world, who have not seen it yet. We have to wait until July
(16th/ 17th I think), and - unlike some obsessives I know - I have so far
managed to avoid learning the entire plot of the film.

<p>
I suppose I can't object to discussions of the technology, but please try
not to make your references too precise.

<p>
Sorry to be a pain, and I appreciate you actually having the courtesy to ask
that question in the first place.

<p>
Regards,

<p>
Craig.

I haven't even seen the Matrix yet, but I've only got another week, maybe
two, to wait for that.
