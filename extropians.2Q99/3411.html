<a href="3310.html#3411qlink1">&gt;&gt; ;)) ... When the machines rule the world and if they decide to entertain</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; humans in some kind of zoo I will ask them to implement for me a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; girlfriend</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with a good amount of your intellectual and humoristic characteristics</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ;)...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; please keep some datas so that i can ask you some additional</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; specifications</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; if needed..</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Just to register this on the list again, I am a bouncing, blue eyed boy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm sorry everyone keeps taking me to be female,</i><br>

<p>
I was aware that you present yourself as a male ;)...
I was only interested by extracting some interesting stuff and
characteristics of your external behavior to build something i would be very
pleased with... a female ;))..
<br>
I've written nowhere a supposition of your gender... i'm not too much
interested about that for mailing lists or text communications.

<p>
 maybe my communication
<br>
<a href="3310.html#3411qlink2">&gt;style is too effeminate?</a><br>

<p>
now that you mention it, perhaps it's one of the reason I was thinking about
that...;)
<br>
your reaction is interesting... i should have forcasted that ;)...


<p>
<a href="3310.html#3411qlink3">&gt;Actually this doesn't bother me personally - it's actually really</a><br>
<i>&gt;interesting to be in a position like this. It is a good example of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;elusiveness of identity in fact. For example, in a purely text-based</i><br>
<i>&gt;relationship, how is physical gender really relevant? In fact, how many of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the components of your identity really have relevance in such a context.</i><br>

<p>
completly in agreement.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3310.html#3411qlink4">&gt;We talk a lot about the unknowable post-singularity transhuman future, and</a><br>
<i>&gt;few people conceptualise themselves as having a body in any recognisable,</i><br>
<i>&gt;human sense at all. What then of gender? Will I, born in the 20th century,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but living 10,000 years in the future (hoping), with a distributed</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence across planets or built into an interstellar vessel, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;uploaded into a nano-scale brain, still conceive of myself as male? Still</i><br>
<i>&gt;even conceive of myself as a single entity?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But for now anyway, XY all the way.</i><br>

<p>
if we are not gathered in some kind of museum zoo and that we keep to
improve ourselves, gender will not have any sense for the paths I would
like. Excepts perhaps for some moments of intense sharing of materials and
knowledge... but it would just be a question of interpretation...

<i>&gt;PS: You're still welcome to use me as an intellectual model for your robot</i><br>
<i>&gt;girlfriend - it's just so perverse, I like it.</i><br>


<p>
no perversion intended ... if the robot is build so that she's happy in the
situation ;=)
