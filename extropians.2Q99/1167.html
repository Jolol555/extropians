<p>
On the contrary, the whole alchemy/chemistry area developed out of 'recovering' the secrets of the ancient philosphers.<a name="1178qlink2"> Middle age europe lost the secret of roman concrete, and european kings all wanted to know how to build structures like the pyramids using the magical methods that myth purported they were built</a> with.

<a name="1178qlink3">Moreover, the scarce information left about the lost 'Atlantis' inspired Columbus in his quest for the new world.</a> If there had been more substantial supporting 'evidence' for the Ptolemaic solar system, Copernicus and Galileo might have been supressed even more violently than they were. Leaving more accurate maps of the egyptian area would have caused the death of egyptology, because the antiquities would have been pillaged all the more sooner before controls were set in place.

<p>
The humanities were left with the most information, and have resulted in the above. The hard sciences were starved of data and look what resulted.
