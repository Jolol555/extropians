<a name="3669qlink7">However, that's changing now; the K7 looks like it could give the P-III</a> a

<a name="3669qlink9">of changing CPU architectures; just recompile and you can run all the

<p>
Last I checked, a Z80 was a dollar or two a chip. Why aren't we all running
massively parallel Z80 machines? Perhaps because building a machine with
500 CPUs will be much more expensive than buying them and writing software
to do anything useful on them will be a monumental task?</a>

<p>
<a name="3669qlink11"><a href="3586.html#3648qlink6">&gt;You can implement a pretty frisky 32 bit CPU core plus networking </a><br>
<i>&gt;in ~30 kTransistors, and I guess have semiquantitive die yield assuming </i><br>
<i>&gt;1 MBit grains.</i><br>

<p>
But what good will it do for me? I used to work with Transputers, which
were going to lead to these massively parallel computers built from cheap
CPUs. Didn't happen, because there were few areas where massively parallel
CPUs had benefits over a single monolithic CPU.</a>

<p>
I find discussion of voxel rendering pretty bizarre from someone who 
complains about my regarding 32MB as a 'reasonable amount' of memory for 
a graphics chip. Reasonable voxel rendering is likely to need gigabytes
of RAM, not megabytes.</a>

<p>
<a name="3669qlink13"><a href="3586.html#3648qlink8">&gt;The reason's why we don't have WSI yet are mostly not technical. It is </a><br>

<p>
Anamartic were doing wafer-scale integration of memory chips more than
a decade ago; from what I remember, they needed a tremendous amount</a> of 
<a name="3669qlink14">work to test each wafer and work out how to link up the chips which worked 
and avoid the chips which didn't. This is the kind of practical</a> issue 
<a name="3669qlink15">which theoreticians just gloss over, and then 'can't understand' why
people don't accept their theories.</a>

<p>
<a name="3669qlink16">The reason we still use monolithic chips is not that people are afraid of
trying other solutions, but because we have tried those other solutions,
and so far they've failed. That may change, but I don't see any good evidence
of that.
