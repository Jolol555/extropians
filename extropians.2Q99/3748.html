-Eric Ruud said

<a href="3745.html#3748qlink1">&gt; Let's start letting little kids drive!</a><br>
On private roads, sure.

<p>
&gt; and while we're at it, let's let<br>
<a href="3745.html#3748qlink2">&gt; anybody perform surgery on anyone else!</a><br>
With their permission? Absolutely.

<p>
This latter is one of the most urgently needed reforms. The ability of
medical unions to restrict trade is responsible for much of the ill-health
remaining in society. Many operations could be performed by people with far
fewer than the typical decade-long training required by law. Let anyone buy
anything they want to and let them worry about the consequences.

<p>
&gt; And we could make all of the jet<br>
<a href="3745.html#3748qlink3">&gt; liner captains people we find on the street!</a><br>
You are using "we" in a very confusing fashion.

<p>
&gt; Hell why do we have tests for ANYTHING?<br>

<p>
Two reasons, one legitimate and personal, the other illegitimate and
coercive

<p>
Reason 1 - personal tests to establish fitness for purpose.

<p>
I test the movies I see by looking at like-minded reviewer's assessments
Also, we impose tests on the people we deal with. If this is done in a
competitive environment, I think this is just fine. If you have a private
road and won't let people under 28 drive on it, I might even choose to drive
on your road.

<p>
reason 2 - tests are imposed to capture gain from restricting trade.

<p>
If a group uses tests AND restricts competition then I think this is
illegitimate. Examples include medical associations not merely imposing
restraints own their own members (legitimate guild activity) but gaining
exclusive government sanction for their rules.

I saw this in a sig.
Democracy:  Three wolves and one sheep voting on what to have for supper.

But I think this is closer to the truth
Democracy:  Three sheep and one farmer voting on what to have for supper.
