Gasoline is the explosive driver of pistons in a conventional internal
combustion engine, which prevents battery drain through the alternator.  Any
fuel of an internal combustion engine does so by exploding.

<p>
Piezo-electric materials can generate electrical current from pressure, and
vice versa.  Very high pressure, eg, from high explosives, would probably tend
to destroy the piezo-electric materials.

Most nuclear reactors used for power generation do so by heating water, ie,
steam turbines create the electricity.

<p>
The Sun blankets the Earth each day with enough convertible power for pretty
much any power needs.  A satellite farm in orbit with large solar panel arrays
and a microwave downlink might be an efficient generator of power.

<p>
In atomic (fission) explosions, a tiny amount of the mass is converted to
energy.  This energy is somewhat uncontrollable, and has negative side effects
such as dirty radiation particles.

<p>
<a name="0851qlink1">A device that could controllably convert minuscule amounts of matter to energy
in a harnessable fashion, would be the end-all be-all of power generation,
again barring extra-dimensional power sources.</a>
