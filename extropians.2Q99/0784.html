<a href="0763.html#0784qlink1">&gt;I like the idea of having control over exploring what it would feel like to</a><br>
<i>&gt;be a woman.  VR may be the easiest way to eventually experience this.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt;who would I date if I still felt like a man inside of female body?  No,</i><br>
we'd
<br>
<a href="0763.html#0784qlink2">&gt;have to fix it so I actually felt like a woman inside.  It's odd to think</a><br>
<i>&gt;about.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0798qlink1">I know that my sexual preferences would not change based</a> on the gender of my
<a name="0798qlink2">body. I thing maybe I fall in that "androgynous" catagory. I took</a> a test
<a name="0798qlink3">once when I was in counseling that tested for male and female
characterisitics, and I ended up about even. I know that when</a> I'm playing in
<a name="0798qlink4">role-playing games I often choose male characters, not because</a> I don't enjoy
<a name="0798qlink5">being a woman, but because I'm a woman every other minute</a> of the day and an
<a name="0798qlink6">rpg is my chance to try something different. I suspect that if</a> I were male,
<a name="0798qlink7">most of my characters would be women. The grass is always greener,</a> eh?:-)
