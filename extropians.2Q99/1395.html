<p>
'Manually'? Isn't there such a thing a combinatorial explosion? Are we 
supposed to think up billions of combinations and screen them by
building molecular models  and docking them by hand?

<p>
<a href="1391.html#1395qlink2"> &gt; presentation at the NAS Computational Molecular Nanotechnology Workshop.</a><br>
<i> &gt; Wipke believes that "computers, when properly programmed, [can] be more</i><br>
<i> &gt; creative than chemists in the task of inventing new chemical structures."</i><br>
 
<p>
Wow. What a profound statement. 

<p>
<a href="1391.html#1395qlink3"> &gt; Called INVENTON, the program automatically constructs chemical frameworks</a><br>
<i> &gt; [...]</i><br>
<i> &gt; scoring functions selected by the chemist, Wipke explained.</i><br>
 
<p>
All this is not exactly new. Look at Gasteiger's work, for
instance. WODCA even gives you synthesis routes.

<a href="1391.html#1395qlink4"> &gt; Productive Approach To Design</a><br>
<i> &gt; "A computer program can invent molecules that have never been conceived of</i><br>
<i> &gt; and do not exist in any database anywhere," he commented. In its six years</i><br>
<i> &gt; of existence, INVENTON has designed structures in the domains of</i><br>
<i> &gt; nanotechnology (self-assembling molecules in nanoscale systems) and</i><br>
<i> &gt; pharmaceutical drugs (such as mimics of known drugs for cancer and enzyme</i><br>
<i> &gt; inhibitors for AIDS).</i><br>
<i> &gt; "Designing a system like this is a complex task -- one that requires really</i><br>
<i> &gt; logical thinking. AI methods are already being used by INVENTON to</i><br>
<i> &gt; prioritize tasks, and heuristic search is used to reduce the number of</i><br>
<i> &gt; `relevant' constraints." In addition, bringing "engineering principles</i><br>
<i> &gt; across boundaries to assist chemical design" has been useful, Wipke noted.</i><br>

<p>
I don't see GA methods mentioned here. I don't have much faith in AI
methods in that context.

<p>
<a href="1391.html#1395qlink5"> &gt; Automated molecular design will benefit from greater CPU speed, more</a><br>

<p>
The thing won't run parallely in a cluster?

<p>
<a href="1391.html#1395qlink6"> &gt; knowledge and understanding, and larger organized collections of chemical</a><br>
<i> &gt; information readable by computer, he said, adding that "having more complex</i><br>
<i> &gt; problems will accelerate our abilities to problem solve."</i><br>
 
<p>
They don't tell whether the system does learn progressively or has to
start from scratch each time.
 
<p>
<i> &gt; Collaboration with NAS</i><br>
<a href="1391.html#1395qlink7"> &gt; Collaborative work between Wipke's group at UCSC and Al Globus (NAS</a><br>
<i> &gt; applications and tools group) has included modifications to the search</i><br>
<i> &gt; strategy and solving simple initial problems. Current work is focused on</i><br>
<i> &gt; developing fragment libraries designed for nanotechnology and then applying</i><br>

<p>
Now that particular focus is indeed interesting.

<a href="1391.html#1395qlink8"> &gt; them to problems requiring very stiff molecules. A more difficult future</a><br>
<i> &gt; problem is taking advantage of the high degree of symmetry common in</i><br>
<i> &gt; nanotechnology problems and spanning space with molecular fragments that can</i><br>

<p>
'High degree of symmetry common in nanotechnology problems'?
Wow. Nanotechnology must be way further than I thought. Or maybe they have 
got a really good crystal ball.

Thanks for the item. Why don't you post such stuff to
transhumantech@excelsior.org ? We have need of such content.
