<i>&gt; Hold on a sec. YOU are the one who is saying that murder and crime is where </i><br>
<i>&gt; these guns are going, not whoever that was.. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
96 % of the homicides committed in 1995 in the US were murders; 
that is they were both intentional killings and were ruled 
unjustifiable.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3201.html#3307qlink2">&gt; then, to agitate,  you say they want to put them in hands of people who do </a><br>

<i>&gt; those statistics about murder, then.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
They refuse to support the removal of guns from the possession of 
those most likely to commit murder.  That is backhanded support.
<br>

<i>&gt; Accidents are caused by  yahoos like me and my plaid trash ancestors, </i><br>
<i>&gt; irresponsible people who need training, not banning. If you take them away </i><br>

<i>&gt; hey look how effective drug bans are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Guns are a lot harder to hide on one's person than drugs (since 
they are metal-detectable and of at least a certain size), are 
glaringly obvious when being used, and are retained on one's 
person after use.  It is illegal to go around injecting people with 
poisons, too.
