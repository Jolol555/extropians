<a name="4742qlink1">After reading Bruce Sterling's _Holy Fire_, I got the idea</a> that US
society is so protective of its children because they are the first
immortal generation, and the values we teach them will become part of
human society forever. So, in this sense, I can almost support heavy
handed regulations (almost).

<p>
I came across a web site some months ago - I will try to dig it up -
that was basically the history of the human race as the history of child
abuse. Short version: children are 'pure', adults are poisoned with sin,
it is ok to put a little of this sin into children, since they have so
much innocence it won't harm them.

<p>
I think US society sexualizes children, then punishes anyone who
'crosses the line' as a collective atonement for the sexualization. (I
have a friend currently serving 3 years in prison - he clicked on a link
to order some alledged child porn, which of course was delivered by USPS
agents).

<p>
<a name="4739qlink1">It may be more complex than that. Years ago, I read _Molecules of the
Mind_, which argued that women indeed seek to attract a single mate, to
protect her child (and herself while encumbered with it, internally or
externally), but also prepared a fallback strategy of causing doubt as
to the child's paternity, the better to induce a replacement to consider
the child his should the original mate disappear.</a>
