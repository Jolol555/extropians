I believe that it was because you called him a racist, and he was defending 
himself against that by holding out some examples of his own dislike of 
opression towards ethnic groups. Of course he was defensive. Have you ever 
erad your own posts? You are demanding an apology? You speak in ways that 
only emflame.
<br>
Something else:
<br>
You insist that the Scottish (and I would have also responded tha same way if 
you had denied my Native American Ancestor's plight as being bullshit) don't 
measure up to the standards of racism, opression or slavery. 
When you insist that treatment of "black" people historically, is worse than 
other tribal peoples,  you indulge in one of the most dangerous practices 
that keeps racism alive today. You have to acknowledge all aspects of it, and 
look for solutions. 
<br>
Your self rightousness won't solve anything.
