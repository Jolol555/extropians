<p>
I would like to call this proposed institute (separate from ExI)
something along the lines of the "Institute of Future Sciences" a
quick web search revealed a New Age &lt;something&gt; with the same name,
whether it's real or not is hard to tell.  IMHO, the name should
embody the idea without refering to transhumanism or extropianism
directly.

<p>
Goals: Educate the public to the potential of future developments in
science and technology in a clear and rational manner.  Establish the
means for the academic pursuit of new and emerging science and
technology.  Or in other words, bombard the media with critical
evaluations of future developments in science and technology in a hope
to over come the inherent "disasterbation" and spread the tranhumanist
meme.  And try to organise transhuman-oriented courses at all levels
of academia and encourage the publication of transhuman-oriented
papers.

Comments?
