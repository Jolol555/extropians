<a name="4573qlink1">hi all.
<p>
	the recent discussion about the problem of identity preservation
during uploading seems very interesting. as someone here pointed out, the
debate divides into two major camps -- A. those who measure identity
through objective observation, and B. those who relie on subjective
experience. along another dimension, the former camp tends to believe that
patterns of information alone can be conscious while the latter tends to
require a chain of causality as well.  
<p>
	although i incline toward the latter, i do not believe that the
matter is arguable either way ... it seems to be a matter of faith.
however, i do see some potential effects of this division which appear
unsettling. it seems to me that uploading patterns of information (say
into a platform-independent software representation) will be much easier
than implementing one-neuron-at-a-time nanosurgery. taking note that group
A. usually have no trouble with pure software while group B.</a> generally
prefer seqential neuron replacements, i fear that one population of
transhumanists will most likely be uploaded appreciably before the other. 
<p>
	 perhaps i am overly cynical, but i do not like the idea of living
under a population of bona fide "superior" beings. i am not suggesting
that power necessarily brings about corruption and oppression (wait ... it
sounds ... hmmm), but i do expect that increased intellect would bring
about different priorities. what do you think?
