It's strange how easily one can become attached to an issue with a
religious fervor - even though cool thought will reveal that there ARE
parts of both sides' argument that are valid.

<a name="2536qlink1">I am sure there were some who bewailed the end of coal use for heating
homes as the end of the American way of life, and I personally know people
who hate Diesel locomotives because they killed off the majestic (and
filthy!) old steam engines. Both were the result of the inexorable march of
progress, but some cannot let their minds change to keep up. When something
that makes guns totally unneeded (personal force field?) is invented, there
will still be those who will not give up their guns, or their hate of those
who still keep guns...</a>
