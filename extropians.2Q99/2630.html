And I have said that they are not totally unreasonable, but only as I interpret them
to be, if I get to decide who fits your definitions. The problem with these sort of
restrictions is that as other governments have demonstrated in the past, such
restrictions can be redefined by any legislature, or tyrant, or judicial activist,
to mean whatever they want them to mean, which IMHO is the best reason not to have
such restrictions in the first place. I personally would rather live with the low
risk of possible criminal activity against me that I know I can defend against, than
to live under a system where there is absolutely no protection against a tyrannical
government enslaving some or all and committing genocide against the evil minority
of the day.

<a name="2698qlink2">Joe, you always seem to be big on security. Please show me where in either the
Constitution or the Declaration of Independence that says that there is some
inalienable right to security? Freedom is decidedly NOT security, and our country is
not meant to give anybody security. We can drag out the famous Ben Franklin quote
about freedom versus security if you want, to show the founders intent.</a>

<p>
<a name="2698qlink3">I don't want ANY security from the government, I am quite capabile of providing my
own. Government too often views any security power as the power to protect you from
yourself.
