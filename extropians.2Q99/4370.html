I agree, in the sense that there's a persistent illusion of a "hard'
consciousness problem, or a perceived need for conscious perceptions to
have a uniquely special status of some sort. Look at some of Searles'
arguments about "semantic contents" for instance, he might as well be
talking about ectoplasm or some other kind of ghostly stuff. Here on
this list, we've got high intellectual ground arguments of a comparable
nature, where maybe perfectly smart ET's wouldn't be conscious because
of not having the right ectoplasm, or excuse me, because maybe they
wouldn't have the right sort of super hypothetical physics connection,
or something.

<p>
I've been inspired by reading Dennett's book _Kinds of Minds_, he does
interesting arguments about how evolutionary process relates to the
development of mind capabilities, it's all part of what he calls the
Tower of Generate and Test. Meanwhile, if we really want to get back to
basics, we should recognize that our mental processes are in themselves
real-world computational events, and therefore no *less* real than
anything else in the universe. In other words, "I think, therefore I
think". Also "how do you know that I don't know whether a fish has
feelings", like hey man, that's right on!
