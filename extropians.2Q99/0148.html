<p>
If the universe is not infinite, what is it that lays infinitely beyond it?

<p>
I put forward that beyond our universe is absolute vacuum with no light, and
beyond that approximately infinitely more universes in various stages of
expansion and contraction.  Similarly to how we might astronomically observe
protostars forming and supernovae, perhaps somewhere right now a new universe
is experiencing its Big Bang, and another is contracting to either a super
black hole or a proto-universe to explode again.</a>

<p>
<a name="0152qlink2">Where two expanding universes collide, there shall be much energy.  Crossing
the barrier or region between two universes might be possible or impossible.
Two universes colliding is a wave of energy from each universe colliding at
almost the speed of light.  I believe relativity holds true as we can see
from the redshift phenomenon.  There are some redshift anomalies, but
evidence points towards the Big Bang theory.

<p>
Alternately, there is an ontological plane above ours where our universe is
an experiment in a test tube.

<p>
Of course, similarly, all the universes in an infinity of space might simply
be an occurrence in a higher level ontological plane.</a>

<p>
<a name="0152qlink3">An approximately infinitely long time ago, prior to the Big Bang, if it
occurred, either something existed, or nothing existed, on our ontological
plane.

<p>
I would suggest the term Universe (capitalized) to represent all the
universes in an infinity of space, conjecturally.  I would suggest the term
Metaverse to represent all things.</a>

<p>
Infinity, i, or oo, is a scalar number increase without bounds in one
dimension.  Infinity, I, is i in i dimensions.
