I actually think that this is mostly a myth (which is especially
spread by male chauvinists ascribing female behavior they don't like
to a lack of sexual activity of the woman).

<p>
<a href="0797.html#0804qlink2">&gt; I am wondering what type of differences their are biologically, if </a><br>

<p>
Note that this depends a lot on *how* they are influenced.</a> I would say
<a name="0821qlink4">the human mind and body can handle it quite well. 

<p>
(Another meme which I'm suspicious of is this idea that suppressing
something will automatically lead to a catastrophic build up. It is
based on Freud's thinking, and might apply in some areas but the
general applicability is rather doubtful.)

<p>
Personally I think being asexual can have many benefits. It saves
energy and time for other fields of activity, helps to avoid getting
trapped by many powerful atavisms and cultural biases and makes it
possible to sneak out of many gender stereotypes, etc.</a>
