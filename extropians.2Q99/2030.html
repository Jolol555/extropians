<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt; The problem with banning guns is, ultimately, that one's life is one's </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; responsibility to support and defend. Just as one ought to be free to make </i><br>
<i>&gt; a </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; living ( a basically libertarian premise) one also ought to be free to </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; *protect* that life. And so long as there exists a threat of a forceful </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; attack on oneself, it is quite prudent to have the means to protect your </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; life. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  And both removing guns from the hands of the irresponsible (violent </i><br>
<i>&gt;  criminals, the mentally deficient and/or deranged, children, spouse </i><br>
<i>&gt;  and/or child abusers) and preventing them from arriving there is a </i><br>
<i>&gt;  reasonable, rational and prudent life-protection measure to take.&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My point was made from an individualistic standpoint. An individual takes </i><br>
<i>&gt; action for an individual's life. Laws are not individual action, they are </i><br>
<i>&gt; systematic violence (as I thinkwas pointed out previously). I do agree that </i><br>
<i>&gt; it is bad when the category of people you write get guns....but I definitely </i><br>
<i>&gt; disagree with your methods (law).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
It needs to be done for the good of all of us and there ain't no other 
way.
<br>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt;  </i><br>
<a href="2015.html#2030qlink2">&gt;  &gt; Finally, besides personal responsibility and central inefficiency, I think </a><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; that thinking that one can legislate virtue in a populace is incorrect. A </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; society emerges from a group of people, and a virtuous society emerges </i><br>
<i>&gt; from a </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; group of virtuous citizens. Its a "bottom-up" phenomenon, not a "top-down" </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Not to indulge in ad populum too much, but the restrictions I have </i><br>
<i>&gt;  advocated would be law if we had a direct vote on them, since the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  majority of voters support them.  Next, although I wasn't the one </i><br>
<i>&gt;  who brought the "people" up, I expect to hear all about the tyranny </i><br>
<i>&gt;  of the majority, while hearing not a peep about the danger of one's </i><br>
<i>&gt;  future being erased by a crazed minority of one. &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Voting is not an example of an emergent phenomenon. Voting is the tyranny </i><br>
<i>&gt; that you mention. what I was trying to say was that virtue is what people </i><br>
<i>&gt; choose to do. One can only have a virtuous society when the people choose to </i><br>
<i>&gt; be virtuous.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; The danger of "one's future being erased by a crazed minority of one" is </i><br>
<i>&gt; something I am *deeply* concerned about. In fact, I try to be concerned about </i><br>
<i>&gt; my future being erased by *anything*. I think the best way to protect my life </i><br>
<i>&gt; is to *protect* my life. I think that finding good ivestments to avoid my </i><br>
<i>&gt; savings from being eaten away by inflation protects my life. I think exercise </i><br>
<i>&gt; and good nutrition protects my life. And I think owning a gun protects my </i><br>
<i>&gt; life. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am sypathetic to your concerns about danger from guns; they are very </i><br>
<i>&gt; dangerous things. I happen to think guns are very scary (though I expect this </i><br>
<i>&gt; will lessen considerably once I learn how to use them). But ( to be cliched) </i><br>
<i>&gt; I find being unarmed in the face of armed assailants *much* more scary. And I </i><br>
<i>&gt; wish to avoid that situation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I avoid it in two ways; 1) by being a trained and responsible gun 
owner (I won a sharpshooting badge in the military), and 2) by 
trying to keep them out of the hands of those who are unlikely to 
show as much respect for them as I do, and especially those with 
a pronounced propensity to abuse them.
