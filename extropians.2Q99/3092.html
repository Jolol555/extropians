<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; yes, the only activities which are at lower risk are civil aviation, getting</i><br>

Au contraire; the number of people in the US who died of gunshot-
related injuries in 1995 was 32,909.  These figures were furnished 
by James R. Peterson, a progun activist, in the August issue of 
Playboy Magazine.  This is less than the number killed on the 
highway the same year, but not by a whole lot.

<i>&gt; &gt; Ah, call your opponent a 'redneck', and then you can laugh at them, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While some people I know think that its the soccer mom who will bring about the</i><br>

<i>&gt; How about Mothers Against Teaching Children How to Get Out from Under Their</i><br>
<i>&gt; Skirts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Yeah, Let's All Be Ballsy Men and Gun Each Other Down!  Jeez, 
when gunpowder gets mixed with testosterone, the mixture is not 
only explosive, but also lunifying.
