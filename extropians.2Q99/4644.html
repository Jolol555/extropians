Dave:

<p>
You might want to invest in a book on Tantra.  Although it's not really
"practical relief... available today" - it IS one alternate method of
controlling your sexual urges.

<p>
I'd be interested to hear the opinions of younger people on the list on this
subject - I'm 19, first reading about Tantra when I was 16.

Subject: Controlling the male sex drive


<p>
I'm tired of being dominated by my hormones. I waste vast amounts of
time and energy thinking about and having sex, and I'm constantly
being distracted by sexual thoughts. Sometimes I think it would be
better--now that I've sired all the children I plan to--to just get
out of the sex game altogether. (I'm 39, married, three children.)
Castration would be a little extreme (permanent) and I don't know
exactly what the effects would be. I'm sure there are drugs that can
help, but I don't know how effective they are, how safe they are for
long-term use, or even what they're called or how to get them.

<p>
Is there any practical relief for this problem available today?

<p>
