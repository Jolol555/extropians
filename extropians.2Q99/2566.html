<a href="2561.html#2566qlink1">&gt; (Now does anyone know what I'm getting into with "Adapton," and does it</a><br>
&gt; _really_ work for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?)

<p>
My boyfriend has a cholesterol problem, and I have a weight problem.  He ate hardly
any fat, and he pressured me to repeated reduce the amount of fat I ate.  I got CFS
symptoms and we ended up splitting up.  Eventually, I switched to a high fat, high
protein, low carb diet; and I miraculously lost weight even though I was eating
more, and my CFS went away.

<p>
About a year later, I found out that my ex-boyfriend had CFS, and I convinced him
to start eating more fat (especially olive oil and fish).  And he is now getting to
be his old self once again.

<p>
<a name="2947qlink1"><a name="2567qlink1">All this anti-fat hysteria is going around, and people are forgetting</a> some basic
</a>
<a name="2567qlink2">fact.  Fats are called essential fatty acids for a good reason.</a>  You need fat in
<a name="2947qlink2"><a name="2567qlink3">your diet every day, and without fat you will die.  And if you don't</a> get enough
</a>
<a name="2567qlink4">fat, you immune system is not going to be able to do its job,</a> and you will be
chronically fatigued.

<p>
So eat the fat contained in natural foods (meat, fish, avocados, olive oil) and
avoid the bad fats that are used in junk foods. And keep you cholesterol and
waistline in check by staying away from foods that make your insulin levels go sky
high (bread, sweets, cereals, and other junk food).
