How about something a little less nanotechnologically intensive.
<a name="2397qlink1">A device, or collection of devices that aids homeostasis- monitors
internal states and tweaks them back to optimum- that resides in the
stomach and/or intestinal tract. A cybernetic " tapeworm".</a> A minimally
invasive device, it could even be modular like a tapeworm. It might be
powered by the potential difference between the proximal and distal small
intestine or even a methane (lots of that in the gut) fuel cell. With a
gut length of about ten meters, even a device with only a ten millimeter
cross-section would have plenty of room for a lot of useful technology
and if modular, an defective module could just be jetisoned and replaced
by a swallowed update. With an extension into the hepatic tract it could
even have access to the circulation through the portal system. It would
be repairable insitu ( endoscopy ) and with a through-the abdomen port (
belly button?) even better access to the outside could be possible.
