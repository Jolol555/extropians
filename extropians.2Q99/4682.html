Well, the society is enforcing very hypocritical behavior,
I believe quite unusually for any society, and especially for
one calling itself "free".  Expression of natural sexual interest 
(that women are still trying to cause) is considered shameful to
the point of criminality (sexual harassment), recreational sex is
still frowned upon as sinful (though, admittedly, not more so than
in Islamic countries - though I find that even communist Russia had
a more relaxed attitude here), prostitution is discouraged to the
point where it's not practically available, etc.

<a name="4684qlink2">It is quite possible that if the society was less hypocritical and

and spend less time struggling with the absence of opportunities for
sexual expression.</a>

<a name="4684qlink3">Incidentally, the types that shape social norms against human

<a name="4684qlink4">and these issues seem to be generally related, in terms of rational
attitude to human nature and social regulation, and issues of
liberty - so any progress in sexual (and generally behavioral)
liberation seems to help the transhumanist agenda. 


<p>
On the personal level, I would note that spending a few years with
a large number of attractive women, in dance classes, nude resorts,
etc., helps to develop control over sexual impulses and not get too
distracted by any sight.   A fun way to get some self-control  :-)
