 It needs to be done for the good of all of us and there ain't no other

<p>
Well, I'm sure I don't need to mention the bells and whistles that go off 
when I read or hear " good of us all" : )

<p>
As to whether there is no other way, I'm not so sure. I haven't done a large 
amount of study on the issue, so my objection to gov enforcement of such bans 
basically rests on my previous post's points and a few other things that I 
won't list right now (tho I suppose I will later if asked : ). But I'd like 
to hear why you think there is no other way.</a> 

<p>
I'll confess here that I'm coming from an anarchist perspective, so you can 
better iunderstand my points.
