<i>&gt; Bill Gates share a cell?  Could not Microsloth have shipped</i><br>

The M$ OS could be considered to be a creature with a weak or just leaky immune
system. The perp released the digital equivalent of a biological weapon into the
water system. How many hells are reserved for someone who releases a human
tailored avian flu virus into the LA water system?

<a href="0069.html#0075qlink2">&gt; Legal eagles, help me out here: is the melissa author in real</a><br>

<p>
There is a point there. He is an agent  of evolution in releasing that virus,
The smart person would advocate that the guy spends his life on a PC in a padded
cell plugging up bugs in software, in exchange for time outside.
