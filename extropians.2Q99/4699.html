<a href="4661.html#4699qlink1">&gt;&gt; I also never understood the concept of civilians anyway since as</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; you pointed out in many cases they elected their leaders. A</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; definite lack of personal responsibility.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="4661.html#4699qlink2">&gt;A person can dedicate their entire lives to fighting a dictator,</a><br>
<i>&gt;and still be stuck in a country in wartime as a civilian.  We</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't share collective, borg-like responsibility with everyone who</i><br>
<i>&gt;happens to live in the same geographical space as we do; </i><br>

<p>
<a name="4735qlink2"><a name="4733qlink1"><a name="4700qlink1">In a dictatorship they do not share responsibility, in a
representational republic, we do.</a> When China demanded those
</a>
responsible for the bombing of their embassy be punished, I was
hoping that someone would point out that as commander-in-chief
their lapdog clinton was ultimately responsible. 

</a>
<p>
<a name="4735qlink3"><a name="4700qlink2"><i>&gt;by that standard, the students who died at Tianamen square would</i><br>
<a href="4661.html#4699qlink3">&gt;be as culpable as the soldiers who killed them.</a></a></a><br>

<p>
????????

<p>
<a href="4661.html#4699qlink4">&gt;Many regimes are so oppressive that any public attempts to stop</a><br>
<i>&gt;them will guarantee a person's death.  Under such circumstances,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's very hard to tell who supports the regime on the ground; in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the air, it's impossible.</i><br>

<p>
Many of the Serbs openly supported Milosevic, I agree it would be
difficult to target them individually, but I hold them liable.

<p>
<a href="4661.html#4699qlink5">&gt;At the very least, an attacking army should make a special effort</a><br>
<i>&gt;to avoid blowing up the prisons, the most likely location for</i><br>
<i>&gt;dissenters.</i><br>

<p>
We agree on this. I would like to live to see war vanish from the
human experience, but I would have to live a very long time......
