                            of Infinite Logic 

                            - - - - - - - - - - - -
                            BY THOMAS SCOVILLE 

                            June 9, 1999 | As the darkness deepened, the
                            abandoned overpass loomed like a concrete
                            basilica over the setting for Psychrist's
                            cybernetic passion play.

                            It was a forebodingly apocalyptic scene. A
                            bizarre arrangement of monoliths suggested a
                            venue for some abstractly grave final
                            judgment.

                            A roughly circular perimeter of waist-high
                            concrete barriers -- appropriated by some
                            Caltrans highway construction crew
                            confederates -- enclosed a circular arena of
                            cryptically placed, vertical concrete cylinder
                            segments.

                            In the center of the ring was an
                            ominous-looking pit. From this rude breach
                            in the earth rose a more massive pillar with a
                            capstone -- a 20th century industrial facsimile
                            of a Roman column.

                            Atop the column sat a computer: beige
                            minitower sans monitor or keyboard, its
                            stark enclosure sculpturally complementary.

                            Ten feet directly above that, a shockingly
                            large rock hovered in the air, suspended by a
                            cable from the steel substructure of the
                            derelict overpass.

                            In each quadrant of this grim theater,
                            cheerfully surreal in juxtaposition to the
                            oppressive surroundings, stood a small,
                            fuzzy stuffed animal.

                            - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

                            A German video crew documented the event.
                            Nearby, the director -- shaved head and tiny
                            tortoise-shell glasses -- interviewed Psychrist
                            while a cameraman swooped and tilted the
                            camera for an arty, video vérité effect.

<br>
                            "It's a kinetic meta-parable about technology<br>
                            and life on earth," Psychrist explicated. "The
                            four silicon bots represent the hazards of the
                            information age: passivity, detachment,
                            alienation and hubris. All electrically
                            powered, computer-controlled, wirelessly
                            networked. They're just kid's toys, really --
                            those remote-controlled monster trucks --
                            that we've upgraded with motherboards,
                            wireless networking and a spring-loaded
                            claw in the front."

<br>
                            "They receive their instructions from the<br>
                            Doom Server sitting atop the Throne of
                            Infinite Logic." He pointed to the minitower
                            mounted dramatically in the center of the
                            arena. "The transmissions are all radio
                            frequency, but we're also doubling the 'bot
                            transponders through hopped-up red diodes
                            on their backs. Makes it more visually
                            interesting. Especially with the flames." 

<br>
                            "There will be fire?" the director asked in his<br>
                            best postmodern Alsatian deadpan. 

<br>
                            "Oh, yeah. We call the moat around the<br>
                            throne 'the Abyss.' It'll be full of flaming fuel
                            oil during the performance." 

<br>
                            "The vehicle here will be carbon-guided."<br>
                            Psychrist pointed to a menacing device that
                            looked like an off-road lawnmower bristling
                            with armaments. "In front, you got your
                            high-speed, rotating tungsten saw.
                            Flame-throwers out either side." He tugged
                            on a long, springy metal antenna arching
                            from the top of the vehicle. "There's also the
                            Chip Whip -- constantly rotates, 360 degrees.
                            Ultra high voltage contact on the end. Just
                            right for frying semiconductors." Psychrist
                            slapped the mechanical beast's flank. "But it's
                            all consistent with its nature: carbon-guided,
                            fossil-fuel-powered, all analog. No digital
                            machinery<a name="4361qlink1"> of any kind."

                            Faux Herzog gave Psychrist a quizzical look.</a>
<br>
                            "Carbon-guided?"<br>

<br>
                            "A rat."<br>

<br>
                            "Rat. Is this some sort of new technology?"<br>
                            the German queried earnestly.

<br>
                            "It's a very old technology, if you want to<br>
                            think of it that way. It's a resilient, massively
                            parallel, fault-tolerant, hairy little critter
with
                            four legs and a tail. A marvel of engineering.
                            More than that. Art. They're all around this
                            neighborhood. You should check 'em out
                            sometime." 

                            The videographer gaped. Psychrist decided a
                            clarification was in order.

<br>
                            "The control mechanism is an actual rat,<br>
                            inside one of those transparent plastic
                            hamster-balls. The little guy has spent a
                            couple of weeks in a Skinner box. We've
                            been auto-shaping the rat to roll the ball
                            toward flashing lights -- which ought to
                            come in handy, since all the bots will be
                            strobing their LEDs as they transmit packets
                            to the Doom Server. As long as they're
                            strobing, rat'll be tracking 'em, the Carbon
                            Buggy will hunt 'em down and hopefully one
                            of the weapons'll sort 'em out." 

                            The German scribbled in a
                            notebook, then accepted an
                            offering of Evian from a
                            production assistant. "Where did
                            you get this rat?" he asked in a
                            low voice.

<br>
                            "Local boy," Psychrist cheerfully<br>
                            volunteered. "We trapped him in
                            a dumpster only a couple of
                            blocks away from here. He's got
                            the home-field advantage."

                            The director was clearly starting
                            to lose his grip on the translation.
<br>
                            "Home field?" he asked meekly.<br>

                            Psychrist kicked himself into
                            semiotic high gear. "The area
                            surrounding the Throne is
                            conceptualized as the Field of
                            Cultural Production. It's divided into four
                            quadrants: Self-determination. Aesthetics.
                            Affect. Perversity. Each one has a virtue
                            proxy -- a little stuffed animal. Bear, pig,
                            frog, unicorn. The bots receive directives
                            from the Doom Server to search them out
                            and deliver them to the flames of the Abyss.
                            We put in a bunch of randomly placed
                            concrete pylons just to make things more
                            challenging for the transit logic."

<br>
                            "The bots are blind, but the Master can locate<br>
                            them within the field with a grid of sensors.
                            The bots troll until they grab something, then
                            the Server guides them into the Abyss." 

<br>
                            "I see," asserted the director, though he<br>
                            didn't.

                            Psychrist pointed to the massive boulder
                            hanging over the mini-tower. "This guy we
                            call 'Heisenberg's pebble' -- it represents the
                            uncertainty of the outcome. The suspending
                            hardware is rigged with special explosives.
                            They blow as soon as all of the bots fail to
                            check in within a 500-millisecond interval."
                            He smirked a little sadistically. "Snaps the
                            cabling hardware. About three tons, straight
                            down."

                            The director gripped the Evian bottle, flexing
                            it in his hands. "And what will be this
                            outcome?"

<br>
                            "Carbon Rat's got five minutes of fuel to stop<br>
                            the silicon bots from robbing the Field of
                            every human virtue." Psychrist shrugged.
<br>
                            "Your guess is as good as mine."<br>
