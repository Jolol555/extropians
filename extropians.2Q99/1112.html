Or the disvocery of a carved wooden glider which uses an aerofoil,
vertical stabilizer, and the idea of dihedral for stability. All in an
Egyptian tomb....

Mohammed II used a screw gun type cannon with a 36" bore to take
Constantinople...and his descendants were still using the same guns in
the 18th century to bombard British ships trying to run through the
Dardanelles without paying the tolls...

The important part of discovering lost info like that is it value to
archaologists in developing a more thorough knowledge of who knew what
when and how.

<p>
<a name="1120qlink1">We should push ahead as much as possible. Fears of the passing of the
human race are IMHO rather premature and naive. You forget that even
today, there are humans living a near stone age existence, and we have
not exterminated the other ape species either.</a>
