<p>
Darin Sunley noted an apposite dialog by
<br>
<a href="1910.html#1948qlink1">&gt; Hofstadter ... on the very subject in</a><br>
<i>&gt; Godel, Escher, Bach. An ant colony that, when communicated with as a whole,</i><br>
<i>&gt;was a rabid free-market libertarian, even though it was composed of utterly</i><br>
<i>&gt;selfless collectivists (ants).</i><br>

<p>
Trouble is that the analogy breaks down as the ants are not selfless
collectivists: they do not have a representation of the collective. They are
merely robots programmed to bring food home, kill things in the nest that
are not ants, etc.

<p>
If they each had a mental representation of the hive, then the analogy would
be valid, otherwise, it is like saying my telephone is a collectivist
because it connects me just whenever us humans want it too: it has no
choice, because it has no representation of that amongst which it might
choose.
