Sorry, but it won't be that easy. Living tissue can be severely damaged by 
even very modest amounts of excess heat.  Implanted devices are limited to 
radiating &lt;2 mW per square cm of surface area, and I expect nanotech 
devices would face the same constraint.

If you want to implement anything that consumes significantly more energy 
<a name="2701qlink1">than normal tissue, you'll have to build a cooling system to carry off the 
excess heat.</a>  That's going to be a difficult task, since we can't use a 
traditional thermal heat-exchange system.  My best idea at the moment would 
be to look for a fancy chemcal solution, but that could take a lot of 
searching.  We'd need a strongly endothermic reaction that takes place 
easily in the environment of living tissue, and is easily reversed in an 
environment exposed to open air.
