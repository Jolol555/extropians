Do you really think that the cost of sending one person to raise a group
of 10-20 kids from embryos all the way to a productive age (early
<a name="0068qlink2">teens?), is lower than the cost of getting 10-20 adults and the stuff
they need to survive and thrive to mars?</a> I don't know if even the most

these kids so they turn out intelligent.

I agree that automation/AI would help out greatly, but we haven't yet
reached the level I think would be needed to make your plan more
cost-effective.<a name="0068qlink5">  Wouldn't it be cheaper in the long run to send a group
of somewhere from 10-50 young adults (maybe some teenagers, sure)?</a>

Not *that* small.

<p>
I do think we're getting to a point where we a wealthy individual or
corporation could fund a small expedition that had a reasonable chance
of success, with additional colonists to follow as soon as the
<a name="0068qlink10">infrastructure is in place for them to arrive.  Are ya listening, Bill
