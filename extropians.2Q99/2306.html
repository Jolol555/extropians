<a name="3392qlink1">A number of us were discussing the new Star Wars movie on IRC, and of
course the subject drifted to the area of "virgin" births. One solution
<a name="2312qlink1">that was put forward was that the "Force" organisms created a
"male-ized" clone of the mother.</a></a>

<p>
Here's the question. Given a female genome, is there enough info in
there for a purely typographic process to generate a male genome? Or
vice versa? Or is it necessary to "ad-lib" the missing parts to change
the gender that that particular genome will grow into.

<p>
<a name="2308qlink1">ObExtropianism: If I were to want to move into a female clonde body for
a couple years (being male) would the genetic engineers (expert
systems?) have to exercise creativity in the design of the female body
created from my genome, or is there a one to one correspondance?</a>
