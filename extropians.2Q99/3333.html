<a name="3335qlink1">Putting aside the fact that the whole truth about QM remains to be determined,
you seem to be rather gleeful that we can and/or should eliminate any
'spookiness' in QM.  If so, why?  I rather liked the fact that QM can be so
unsettling.  From an *extropic* point-of-view, the non-locality and uncertainty
of QM leaves more possible pathways for increasing extropy than a purely
classical view.  Obviously, science is about uncovering the truth, but
personally I'd be much more gleeful if QM turns out to be even weirder than</a> it
is now.
