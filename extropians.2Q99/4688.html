<a href="4647.html#4688qlink1">&gt;Just the idea that somebody can (or wants to)</a><br>
<i>&gt;stay out of the socio-emotional carousel most others are into seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be unsettling. I think it is quite closely related to how many people</i><br>
<i>&gt;react to transhumanist sentiments; we question things that are taken</i><br>
<i>&gt;for granted, and that suddenly makes them less certain which in turn</i><br>
<i>&gt;is unsettling. Hence the reactions trying to "normalize" the person.</i><br>

<p>
I notice this everyday. It seems that I am in an extreme minority in that I
determine the source of "my" inputs (primal instinct or impartial logic)
before acting. I note that others tend not to be concerned with the source
of their thoughts. For instance, we will all, upon meeting a new person,
receive tons of input from our primal systems, ranking them in terms of
social fitness, dominance potential etc.. I'm constanly ticking off my
girlfriend for launching knee-jerk veiled personal attacks on others in
direct response to a bad "social-emotional" appraisal. "He's a total
geek...." etc. 
<br>
It's time to get buddhist, man *puff*.....let's loooove one another,
man.....
<br>
In short, to hell with the monkey within, this traditional sense that
"following your heart" is the way to be "good" is a total sack of bull, just
the opposite is true. The monkey acts as judge, jury and executioner. So
veto those knee-jerk reactions and nicer thee shall be....

<p>
End of Sermon.
