<i>&gt; &gt; I said that I wanted laws passed that would deny gun ownership to:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1) VIOLENT CRIMINALS</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 2) THE MENTALLY DEFICIENT AND/OR DERANGED</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 3) SPOUSE AND/OR CHILD ABUSERS</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 4) CHILDREN</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; END OF LIST!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; READ IT!   SAVE IT TO YOUR HARD DISK!   BRONZE IT!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; MEMORIZE IT!   STOP MISQUOTING AND MISREPRESENTING</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; IT!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now that we have you set in stone, please further define what each category means.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Are violent criminals: a) murderers b) rapists c) muggers, or are they: d) been</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a car accident, e) spanked their children in public f) a woman who slapped a man</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a rude comment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
A, B &amp;C.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2157.html#2180qlink2">&gt; 2) What minimum IQ do you need to no be considered mentally dificient? Do we go by</a><br>
<i>&gt; the Soviet mental health system, where anyone who disagrees with the politically</i><br>
<i>&gt; correct party line is obviously mentally deranged (as things seem to rapidly be</i><br>
<i>&gt; moving here anyways)?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Someone who is judged to be a danger to themselves or others (I 
had the scary job of relieving a friend of mine of his S&amp;W when he 
suddeny became psychotic during a camping trip.  None of us 
knew beforehand that he was schizophrenic and had spent several 
stretches in institutions, but his family knew - he still had the gun, 
and shouldn't have).
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2157.html#2180qlink3">&gt; 3) What is the standard of action and evidence for spousal and child abuse? What is</a><br>
<i>&gt; the burden of proof and due process?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
If one has been convicted of either, that should be it.  People 
should also be required to relinquish their weapons while a pending 
case is before the court, (the most likely time for a spouse abuser 
to resort to murder-suicide), but they should be returned upon 
acquittal.  People against whom a peace bond has been taken out 
should not be anywhere around their spouse anyway, but if they 
show a propensity to ignore/violate court restrictions, the guns 
should be confiscated for the spouse's safety.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2157.html#2180qlink4">&gt; 4) So when the AARP lobbies to raise the age of majority to 35, they you agree that</a><br>
<i>&gt; everyone younger must give up their guns?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2182qlink1">No, I think that the age in which one may be drafted to pull a trigger 
</a>
for one's country is a good benchmark here.
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2157.html#2180qlink5">&gt; Rather than pushing these standards as laws that can obviously be manipulated and</a><br>
<i>&gt; changed at the whim of the current media/PR pressure, will you push these as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; proposed Constitutional Amendment as they should be?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Amendments to the 2nd ideally, but laws to save lives in the 
interim.
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2157.html#2180qlink6">&gt; If not, then your standards are illegal and unconstitutional.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
So was helping slaves to escape or women to vote, practice 
contraception or own property, once upon a time.
