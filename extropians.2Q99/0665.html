When I posted my retraction last night, I had not read Greg Burch's
comments.  

<p>
I wrote 
<br>
<a href="0561.html#0665qlink1">&gt; Extropy.com, for example, is in debt.  There is no money to be made in </a><br>
<i>&gt; propagating memes.  That's the wrong business to be in.  </i><br>

<p>
To which Greg replied 
<br>
<a href="0566.html#0665qlink2">&gt; Tell that to Ted Turner, Pablo Picasso, Oscar de la Renta, James Cameron </a><br>
<i>&gt; or Oprah Winfrey. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="0669qlink1">Well, I called all those people and told them that.  Most</a> of them didn't
<a name="0669qlink2">know what I was talking about.  I had to explain what a meme</a> is.  Oprah
<a name="0669qlink3">said  "I'm an entertainer.  I wouldn't be where I am today if</a> I talked
<a name="0669qlink4">about memes.  My career would never have gotten past square one."</a>  Picasso
<a name="0669qlink5">said  "I'm an artist.  I don't give a damn about memes.</a>  I just paint what
<a name="0669qlink6">I see."  Ted Turner did know what a meme was, but he said  "I'm a
businessman, first of all.  I want money, power, fame,</a> and beautiful women.
<a name="0669qlink7"> I do have an agenda, of course, and being in my position I can push
certain ideas and not others, but that's not what my career</a> is about.  The
<a name="0669qlink8">idea that somebody would devote his life to propagating memes</a> _as such_ is
<a name="0669qlink9">bizarre.  It reminds me of those cartoons about 'people who</a> don't get the
<a name="0669qlink10">concept.'  Memes can take care of themselves.  Get a life."  

<p>
Greg continued,
<br>
<a href="0566.html#0665qlink3">&gt; No one expects to get rich propagating transhuman ideas</a> or extropian</a><br>
values,
<br>
<a name="0669qlink11">&gt; per se. <br>

<p>
Well, per se is the problem.  If somebody wants to make money, it is
rational for him to promote the idea that wealth is a good thing</a> and should
<a name="0669qlink12">not be confiscated for socialistic reasons.  But when someone has no
intention of making money, but tries to propagate</a> the capitalism meme and
<a name="0669qlink13">the rational selfishness meme, per se --  if his main goal</a> is for people to
<a name="0669qlink14">think the right thoughts about these issues -- I just don't</a> know what to
<a name="0669qlink15">make of this.  It reminds me of something C.S. Lewis said,</a> "It is more
<a name="0669qlink16">important that heaven should exist than that I should get there."</a>  I never
<a name="0669qlink17">understood Lewis's statement, and I don't understand the idea of
propagating memes as such, for their own sake.  

<p>
In today's economy, there are so many opportunities I have</a> to chase them
<a name="0669qlink18">away with a stick.  I'm not saying ExI is useless in its</a> present form, I'm
<a name="0669qlink19">just saying what others have no doubt said many times before</a> -- that there
<a name="0669qlink20">is no reason for it to conceive itself as a propagator of memes, or a
networking group, as opposed to an organization that actually</a> sets forces
<a name="0669qlink21">in motion and makes things happen.  Nevertheless it is what</a> it is, so let's
<a name="0669qlink22">see if there is an alternative.  

<p>
Lyle: 
<br>
<a href="0561.html#0665qlink4">&gt; We are entering the age of memetic competition. What kind</a> of meme can</a><br>
<a name="0669qlink23"><i>&gt; create a phenotype around itself that has the strength</a> to survive and</i><br>
<a name="0669qlink24"><i>&gt; become immortal? An ism? A corporation? or some new kind of meme? </i><br>

<p>
Greg: 
<br>
<a href="0566.html#0665qlink5">&gt; I would answer your question by saying "All of the above." </a><br>
<i>&gt; How would you answer it?</i><br>

<p>
As everyone knows by now, I go back and forth on the question</a> of whether we
<a name="0669qlink25">even need to think in these terms at all.  The computer</a> industry didn't
<a name="0669qlink26">need a meme to bring it into existence, it just happened,</a> and biotech is
<a name="0669qlink27">happening by itself too.  The technology of immortality will</a> come into
<a name="0669qlink28">existence just like personal computers came into existence,</a> as the natural
<a name="0669qlink29">outcome of economic forces.  Nevertheless, sometimes I do think</a> we need a
<a name="0669qlink30">meme that can create a phenotype around itself.  This will have</a> to wait
till tomorrow.
