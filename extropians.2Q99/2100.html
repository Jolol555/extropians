Just like the typical anti-gunner, I ask a direct question, you ignore it.
Where in the 2nd Amendment does it say that the Federal government can 
ban gun possession (or nuclear weapons possession, for that matter) by 
any of these groups?</a>

<p>
<a name="2143qlink2">Answer: it doesn't. The Federal government cannot legally pass any law
restricting possession of weapons of any kind. State governments could, 
at least prior to the 14th Amendment, since when it's been a more open
question.</a>

<p>
<a name="2143qlink3">Whether or not I want them to have guns is irrelevant; the Federal 
government has no legal power to prevent them. None. State governments may
or may not, but they're currently relaxing gun laws while the Feds are
strengthening theirs. Odd that, isn't</a> it?

<p>
<a name="2143qlink4"><a href="2006.html#2100qlink2">&gt;Then yours would definitely be taken away,</a><br>

<p>
See Joe, just like the typical anti-gunner you start off saying you'll only
ban gun ownership for criminals and children, and then we discover that
opposing your laws will also be taken as grounds for being disarmed. What
was that about our silly "slippery slope" argument?</a>

<p>
Well, as they say, it takes one to know one, eh Joe? BTW, I don't own any
guns; while I'm seriously thinking of leaving soon -- partly because I'm 
fed up with the violence here -- I'm probably in the Benighted Kingdom 
for another year or two, and the slippery slope of disarmament is almost
complete over here, from "we have to register guns to reduce crime rates"
(actually so they could confiscate guns from commies come a revolution, 
but that wasn't publically acknowledged 'til decades later) to banning 
almost everything. 

<p>
That said, I'm about to pick up an air assault rifle and probably a couple 
of other airguns before they ban them too;<a name="2107qlink1"> I have to admit, I find creeping
through woods shooting at people with a fully-automatic air</a> rifle a lot more 
fun than shooting paper targets with a bolt-action .30 caliber. Shame they're
not much good for self-defence.

<a name="2143qlink6">You projecting again, Joe?</a>

<p>
<a name="2143qlink7"><i>&gt;other countries </i><br>

<p>
Huh, what? You think the Feds will suddenly slap their foreheads, say "Oh
damn, we forgot the 2nd Amendment, we'd better repeal all those gun laws"
and that will be that? They're ignoring it, just as they have been for
decades now, and they will continue to do so.</a>

<p>
Indeed. That's why we want to give people the tools they need to defend
themselves against violent criminals. Try living in a disarmed country for
a while, Joe, and you'll understand why gun ownership is so important.
