<p>
"John R. Lott, Jr." &lt;john_lott@law.uchicago.edu&gt; responds:
This is incorrect.  1) Only a small number of murders involve people who
are emotionally close to each other.  The normal claim about acquaintance
murders fails to note that most "acquaintances" are rival gang members or
drug dealers or others that we would normally not classify as emotionally
close.  Chicago is the only city that breaks down this data in detail and
from 1990 to 1997 14 percent of their murders involved family, friends,
neighbors, or roommates.  2) Unintentional deaths in the home that result
from mistakenly shooting someone who is thought to be an intruder accounts
for about 30 deaths a year.

"John R. Lott, Jr." &lt;john_lott@law.uchicago.edu&gt; responds:
Most police support objective permitting rules so I am not sure which
police chiefs you are referring to.  59 percent of managerial officers and
76 percent of street officers support such rules.  I am not sure what
numbers that you are referring to.

"John R. Lott, Jr." &lt;john_lott@law.uchicago.edu&gt; responds:
Children under age 5 had 30 accidental gun deaths in 1996.
Children under age 15 had 200.
<br>
Given that there are 80 million people owning around 200 to 240 million
guns, can you name another product that is as common around the home that
is anywhere near as dangerous that has as low of an accidental death rate?
More children under 5 die from drowning in water buckets.
The ultimate issue however is one of trade-offs.  Children's lives are also
saved by parents and other adults being able to defend the children with
guns.  There are tens of thousands of defensive uses involving children
each year.  If you would like a more detailed discussion please see my book.
