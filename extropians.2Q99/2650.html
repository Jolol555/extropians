The breeding program was ctually started in the late 19th century AFAIR. A rich
philantropistby the name of Ira Howard who knew he was going to die very youg
directed his executors to take whatever actions they could think of to increase the
average human life span. At the time the only "biosciences" they had to go on was
animal husbandry, so, after a fashion, that's what they did.

<p>
At the beginning they used the prescence of 4 surviving grandparents at a certain
age to determine inclusion. (They later used more advanced biotech as it became
available. (I don't believe the universe this takes place in ever got around to
doing a human genome project) They set up a foundation that just happened to pay
out large sums of money to young people if they "just happened" to marry and
procreate with certain other young people. No coercion at any point.

<p>
It worked like gangbusters, and by the mid 21st century the average lifespan of the
group was up around 200. Members of this foundation came to refer to themselves as
"The Howard Families". The combination of secrecy, long life, and multiple arranged
marriages (serial polygamy) created a rather distinct culture. The not
inconsiderable inbreeding among the group ended up creating human telepaths (who
were usually mentally retarded).

<p>
Interestingly enough, the longest lived of the bunch, Lazarus Long, who lived for
more then 5000 years (the first thousand of that without advanced rejuvenation
technology) was only a 3rd generation Howard. Way to early for the breeding program
to have given him the longevity he exhibited.
