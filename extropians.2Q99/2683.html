Hello everyone,

<p>
I saw last night the film "The Thirteenth Floor" and found it to be 
excellent.  This is not a special effects extravaganza like "Matrix" but 
instead is a very clever, well acted and plotted science-fiction mystery 
film.  With all the discussions regarding uploading and artificial worlds 
this film for many of you is a must see.  It is not surprising that the 
screenplay is based on actual science-fiction literature rather than a hack 
job by a Hollywood screenwriter.

<p>
I read on the MSN hotmail news site that "Hercules" the t.v. show is being 
partially replaced by a half hour program that involves cryonics.  The 
storyline has an actress/singer who is cryonically suspended in 2001.  She 
is reanimated in the 26th century to help a band of beautiful amazons fight 
evil robots that control this subterranean world.  Of course this is what we 
all hope to do when we are brought back, right guys!  The name of the show 
is slated to be "Cleopatra 2525!"  So it is a female Buck Rogers concept.  I 
don't know if it will be meant to be as intentionally funny as "Futurama."

<p>
I am honored to have John de Rivaz put my posting of my observations and 
life experiences in his Longevity Journal.  Considering the number of years 
his journal has been on the web I probably will be in the future I feel like 
this is almost a time capsule for me to look back on as the years go by.  
I'm not sure how old John is but he must have a number of decades left in 
him.  I'm an old man of thirty-two myself.

<p>
<a name="2692qlink1">I realize this is off-topic but I would like some advice from intelligent 
individuals that I respect.  I suppose for me we should have a "advice for 
the lovelorn" extropian list.  I have met two different women on the net.</a>

<p>
<a name="2694qlink1">One lives here in Anchorage and is a kind and intelligent person who runs a 
party and wedding design business out of her home.  Donna is seven years 
<a name="2885qlink1">older then me and is overweight by thirty pounds (5'3 at 160 lbs.), 
divorced, and has five children,</a> three of whom are still at home and 
elementary school age except for the eighteen year-old daughter who</a> is still 
<a name="2694qlink2">at home and dating a guy in the military.  She has had a rough life due</a> to a 
<a name="2694qlink3">lazy and heavy drinking husband and looks older then she actually is. This 
woman can no longer have children.  I do want to have children one day.

<p>
Her mother who is in her seventies lives with her.  She has alzheimer's and 
is in the advanced stages.  But my friend takes care of her without 
complaint.

<p>
The ex-husband who is unpleasant and ex-military lives very nearby.  She is 
angry with him for not visiting the kids enough.  Despite all this</a> I do care 
<a name="2694qlink4">for her because she is very caring and amazingly positive about life.  Of 
course she is lonely and somewhat desperate though not financially.  She is 
open with me and wants there to be honesty between us.  But she is clear 
that she wants a boyfriend, lover and eventually husband if possible.</a>

<p>
<a name="2694qlink5">The other woman Becky I have never personally met.  She lives in Australia 
and just graduated from college (I am only halfway done).  This gal is very 
bright and recently started teaching.  My aussie friend is twenty-four and 
stunningly beautiful.  When we traded pics she fortunately liked what she 
saw.  For a month when we first met we spent tons of time  chatting and 
emailing each other.  She told me I made her feel like no other man had.</a>  It 
<a name="2694qlink6">was heaven on earth for me at that time.  We are of the same faith 
(mormonism) and this was a major linking factor between us.

<p>
One night she implored me to call her up on the phone but I did not because 
I thought for some reason we might not connect as well over the phone.</a>  Also 
<a name="2694qlink7">I was concerned that we might talk all the time and my phone bills would go 
through the roof bankrupting me.  This was such a huge mistake!  I should 
have called her up and I dearly regret it now.  Right now the two of us 
might have this overwhelmingly strong connection between us had I done it 
than.

<p>
She lives with her folks and at the time her family took in a girl who had 
left the Jehovah's Witnesses for our faith.  The parents and their 
congregation threw rocks through windows and made threatening phone calls 
without break over the months!  Even the police could not get it to stop.</a>

<p>
<a name="2694qlink8">So my beloved left home and found an apt. with this girl to avoid the 
craziness.  She has no computer so we were cut off from each other.  Only 
every few weeks would I hear from her.  But she emailed me yesterday saying 
things are getting back to normal and she has access to a computer again.  
But I feel the special connection between us may have been lost.  But 
perhaps it can be reignited.

<p>
<a name="2788qlink1">I realize that she is probably out of my league.  With her brains</a> and beauty 
<a name="2694qlink9">she could have almost any man she wanted.  I somewhat did back away</a> from her 
<a name="2694qlink10">because I have been rejected by woman before who I was in love with and had 
dated a long time.  I did not want to go through the torment</a> of rejection 
again.

<p>
<a name="2694qlink11">We had originally talked of her visiting me in Alaska or me going to 
Australia but the trouble started and that was at least for than forgotten.  
And also ticket prices are so expensive.  But I may be getting a three of 
four thousand dollar windfall soon that could finance such a trip.  But to 
blow so much money on a wild attempt to court a gal so out of my league 
seems a waste of money.  But I don't want to be an old man regretting my 
never having done my best to marry her.</a>

<p>
<a name="2694qlink12"><a name="2692qlink2">Here is where I have been a fool and a liar.  I told her when we first met 
that I was only twenty-five when actually I am thirty-two!  But I am told 
all the time how I only look twenty-five but still my lie was wrong and 
stupid.  I just got tired of women in their twenties rejecting out of hand 
because I was so "old!"

<p>
I also lied about my weight.  I said that I weighed one-hundred and 
seventy-five pounds but actually I only weigh one-hundred and fifty.</a>  I have 
<a name="2694qlink13">had women mock me for being so thin.  She told me she was not perfect 
because she considers her build too thin being five foot six and weighing 
only one-hundred and ten pounds.  She seems fantastic to a thin guy</a> like me! 
  I am six foot one and like I said only one-hundred and fifty pounds.</a>

<p>
<a name="2694qlink15">I should have told the truth to begin with.  I never thought I could meet 
someone so incredible on the net so it didn't seem to matter.  And here</a> I am 
<a name="2694qlink16">barely half done with college if that really.  I had a friend tell me I 
should only level with her when and if she gets here. Maybe in person we 
would not click like we  did on the net but I doubt</a> that.

<p>
<a name="2694qlink17"><a name="2692qlink3">One reason cryonics and extropianism appeals to me so much</a> is that I see the 
<a name="2694qlink18">unfairness in this world, the highly uneven playing field of life.</a>  I want a 
<a name="2694qlink19">world where everyone gets to be young, good looking, intelligent and well 
cared for.  I honestly believe that a hundred years from now the 
technologies will be here to make that present fantasy an economically 
feasible reality for people.  Either through the second coming of Christ 
and/or human technology this world will one day</a> be.

</a>
<p>
<a name="2694qlink20"><a name="2692qlink4">I just had the misfortune of being born in 1967!  But I could have</a> been born 
<a name="2694qlink21">centuries earlier and had no chance at all compared to what I have in the 
year 1999.  But should I make it through I will appreciate</a> things infinitely 
<a name="2694qlink22">more than those born in the easy living 22nd century.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="2694qlink23"><a name="2692qlink5">The mating game is so damn hard and painful.  I have read about darwinistic 
psychology and it both bothers and fascinates me.  If I just had a much 
bigger balance in my "social currency account" I know I could marry this 
wonderful aussie girl.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="2694qlink24"><a name="2692qlink6">I look forward greatly to any feedback any of you may have to offer.  I 
really need some advice on these matters.  I thank you all</a> for reading this, 
<a name="2694qlink25">take care.</a>

</a><p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
