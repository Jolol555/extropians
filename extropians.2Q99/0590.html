<i>&gt;AI research is a dead end in the short term. Current AI research isn't </i><br>
<i>&gt;accomplishing anything. Until we have a better understanding of human </i><br>
<i>&gt;cognition and the brain in general AI is not going to make any significant </i><br>
<i>&gt;progress. Co-called AI researchers would perform a better service for </i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves and the AI field if they devoted their time and resources to </i><br>
<i>&gt;neuroscience.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Think about it. Can anyone point to achievements made in the field of AI in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the last year? 5 years? 10 years? There are no conceptual achievements. There </i><br>
<i>&gt;is an illusion of progress, but it is not conceptual. The illusion is created </i><br>
<i>&gt;by increases in computing power available</a> to AI researchers. Implementing the </i><br>
<i>&gt;same AI concept on a faster machine yields a more productive result. On the </i><br>
<i>&gt;surface, it appears progress has been made in the AI field. But, in fact, </i><br>
<i>&gt;there has been no conceptual progress in some time. AI researchers are </i><br>
<i>&gt;justing tinkering with faster machines now.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Look at the deities of the AI pantheon, Minsky, Searle, what have they </i><br>
<i>&gt;produced in the last 5 or 10 or even 20 years? Who has expanded on Turing's </i><br>
<i>&gt;work? If Turing is the AI field's Newton, where is the Einstein? All I see </i><br>
<i>&gt;lately is discussions about the limits of computation, club-handed </i><br>
<i>&gt;discussions of consciousness, and starry-eyed fantasies of Powers. There is a </i><br>
<i>&gt;disconnect. Where is the transhumanist explanation for lack of AI progress? </i><br>
<i>&gt;Why don't AI researchers realize they aren't getting *anywhere* until we </i><br>
<i>&gt;understand the operation of the human mind? And if the transhumanists don't </i><br>
<i>&gt;even realize this quagmire, who else will?</i><br>

For those whose MINDS have been memetically inoculated against such reasoned pessimism by extropianism and/or transhumanism, I suggest that WHAT COMPUTERS STILL CAN'T DO by Hubert Dreyfuss might purge the antibodies from your cognitive systems.
