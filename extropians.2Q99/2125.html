It's always good to check both sides of an issue.  I went to Handgun
Control's web site, www.handguncontrol.org, and typed Lott in the search
box.  Here are the first two hits:

<a name="2127qlink1">   Since its publication, researchers across the country have reviewed
   the Lott Study and reanalyzed Lott's data, and found its conclusions
   unsubstantiated. These researchers include</a> Jens Ludwig at Georgetown
   University; Daniel Black of the University of Kentucky and Daniel Nagin
   at Carnegie Mellon University; Stephen Teret, Jon Vernick and Daniel
   Webster, all of Johns Hopkins University; Arthur Kellermann at Emory
   University; and Douglas Weil at the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.

   This study conducted by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence has
   concluded that Dr. Lott and the gun lobby have got it all wrong:
   allowing people to carry concealed handguns does not mean less crime.

<p>
Presumably people interested in this issue will want to follow up and
compare these studies with Lott's, to derive their own conclusions.
