I have not had the chance to talk about the movie with any non-extropians
yet, but I agree that this movie (and new hollywood meme I suspect) is
likely to be beneficial for people like us.

I was thinking about this too. At first I thought it strange that the AIs
were running around in the matrix itself rather than just "deleting the
appropriate file" as someone suggested. But, given the complexity involved,
this makes more sense. Might as well use the intended interface of the
Matrix.

<p>
So I guess this (bigger) conceptual problem fills in the smaller one
mentioned previously ;-)

<p>
(this is the same argument I use to show that I'm not likely to be
a "brain in a vat" as in the classic solipsist thought experiment)
