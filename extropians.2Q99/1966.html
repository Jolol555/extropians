<p>
Good point. Of course, the idea that ants live in some kind of
socialist utopia is a popular myth, in reality ant societies are very
nice examples of spontaneous orders: put together many elements with
carefully selected simple behaviors and you get a very adaptive,
resilient system. There is no central planning in an anthill, just
huge numbers of individuals with programming based on collective
reproductive success.

<p>
<a href="1910.html#1966qlink2">&gt; 2) If one were to view the former Soviet Union as a (very nasty) (proto)</a><br>
<i>&gt; borganism, didn't they argue exactly this, that individual rights (national</i><br>
<i>&gt; soverignity) at the level of the borganism was very important? That was the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rhetoric anyways, as I recall.</i><br>

<p>
That was the rhetoric, although the original goals were borganisation
on the global scale too (it ended for purely practical reasons; it was
more economical for the "borganism" and especially its leaders just to
have an empire than spend huge resources and take big risks on
internationalization). In the end, the SU ended up like any other
individual nation.
