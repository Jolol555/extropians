<a href="1381.html#1392qlink1">&gt;&gt; A wind up router?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think this is the way to go. Especially wind-up satelite</i><br>
<i>&gt;phones. Wind-up PCs and phones are more liberating here than TVs and</i><br>
<i>&gt;radios, since broadcasting is still a centralized process. Free access</i><br>
<i>&gt;to information and communication is a very liberating technology that</i><br>
<i>&gt;makes many current dictatorships untenable or at least weaker. It</i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't necessarily topple them (that is in the end up to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;citizens) but it gives more power and ability to the individual</i><br>
<i>&gt;people.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, indeed. Power to the people puts the idea of immortality (can you live
forever?) in perspective.
<br>
But who gets to decide who will live forever? Obviously not everyone will
get to decide for themselves.

<p>
<a href="1381.html#1392qlink2">&gt;Of course, dumping stuff like this is no miracle cure, you need to</a><br>
<i>&gt;provide good information through it, ideally ensure that the users can</i><br>
<i>&gt;control their own information and set up their own (virtual)</i><br>
<i>&gt;institutions.</i><br>

<p>
Do virtual institutions have less trouble setting up than other institutions
do? I ask because several of my correspondents deny that virtual categories
exist at all. (So far I've managed to ignore or sidestep them.)

<p>
<a href="1381.html#1392qlink3">&gt;In the case of Serbia (not that I have the least interest in debating</a><br>
<i>&gt;that affair), there seems to be some evidence that most of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;population is being fed a highly biased view of what is happening</i><br>
<i>&gt;through state media (unlike us, who just get biased media - but at</i><br>
<i>&gt;least can choose between them :-) and are actually quite misinformed</i><br>
<i>&gt;about what is happening. Here widespread access would undermine the</i><br>
<i>&gt;propaganda. But it wouldn't necessarily change the core problem;</i><br>
<i>&gt;people in Greece, who have access to much freer information, are still</i><br>
<i>&gt;strongly pro-Serbian (for historical, political and cultural</i><br>
<i>&gt;reasons). People won't turn into rational, nice people by having</i><br>
<i>&gt;communications technology - but it likely makes it harder to suppress</i><br>
<i>&gt;rationality and easier to get useful information to and from</i><br>
<i>&gt;elsewhere.</i><br>

<p>
If you want to know about the situation in Serbia, I recommend you contact
daliborm@EUnet.yu

He has some first hand experience with it.
