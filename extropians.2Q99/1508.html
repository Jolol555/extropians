<p>
Continual improvement is the highest good.

<p>
Which changes are considered improvements varies among individuals.

<p>
When making decisions, individuals attempt, with widely varying degrees
of success, to improve themselves and their environment.

<p>
The universe includes all individuals, and from its perspective, all its
parts are striving for their own versions of improvement.

<p>
If individuals become increasingly and continually successful at
improvement, they will continually approach their own ideals of goodness.

<p>
This process of successful improvement by individuals is the way the
universe (from its own perspective) becomes the highest good.
