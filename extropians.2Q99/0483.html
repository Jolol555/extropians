Abstract
<br>
  BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of androgenic alopecia is not fully understood.
  A microbial-driven inflammatory reaction abutting on the hair follicles might
  participate in the hair status anomaly. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was
  to determine if ketoconazole (KCZ) which is active against
  the scalp microflora and shows some intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity
  might improve alopecia. METHOD: The effect of 2% KCZ shampoo
  was compared to that of an unmedicated shampoo used in
  combination with or without 2% minoxidil therapy. RESULTS: Hair density and
  size and proportion of anagen follicles were improved almost similarly by
  both KCZ and minoxidil regimens. The sebum casual level appeared to be
  decreased by KCZ. CONCLUSION: Comparative data suggest that there may be a
  significant action of KCZ upon the course of androgenic alopecia and that
  Malassezia spp. may play a role in the inflammatory reaction. The clinical
  significance of the results awaits further controlled study in a larger group
  of subjects.
