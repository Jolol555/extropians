<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; The Grey Goo is an absurd fantasy, and I treated it with the levity </i><br>
<i>&gt;  it deserves.</i><br>

<p>
I haven't been able to follow this thread that closely, Lyle, and just 
yesterday I was saying in a meeting of extropians here in Houston that I 
think your "Geniebusters" web site is worthwhile (if wrong in some respects 
-- I do think you're attacking a straw man in many instances and, yes, I've 
read it.)  But let me offer a comment about "grey goo", nanotechnology and 
threats to Life the Universe and Everything.

<p>
The very specific threat discussed a long time ago in sci.nanotech that was 
given the name "grey goo" is but one possible harmful use of molecular-scale 
technology and I express no judgment about its plausibility here.  However, I 
<a name="0653qlink1">have been convinced by some pretty rigorous reasoning, explained by some 
pretty smart people, that one does NOT need to make a "genie machine" or even 
a "general-purpose assembler" to cause Very Bad Things to happen with 
molecular scale technology.  In fact, I'm so convinced of this that I think 
it's irresponsible to discuss the details of such ideas in an open, public 
</a>forum.<a name="0653qlink2">  Suffice it to say, Lyle, that a technology capable of causing severe 
destruction on a scale up to and including the level of a planetary ecology 
can be created with molecular technology well short of a general-purpose 
assembler.  Here's a hint: consider the kind of havoc that computer virii can 
cause, even though we're nowhere close to "general-purpose artificial 
intelligence"; all that's required is the capacity for self-replication.</a>
