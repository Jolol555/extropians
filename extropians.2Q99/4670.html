There's an apocryphal story about Oliver Wendell Holmes, while in
his 90s, walking down the street with a friend.  They see a pretty
girl passing the other way, Holmes stops after she goes by watching
her with appreciation, and sighs "Ah, to be 75 again..."

<p>
I guess I'm one of those lucky guys who can appreciate without
losing my main thread of thought.  All kidding aside, perhaps just a
bit of voluntary behavior modification on your part would achieve
your goal of reduced distraction without more invasive chemical
intervention.

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Sure- but I'm in the hedonist faction of extropianism- I enjoy
ogling women (discreetly of course), and carrying the energy back to
my lover. I won't claim that this is the *best* way, or that it's
appropriate for you, but it sure is more fun than turning it off.
