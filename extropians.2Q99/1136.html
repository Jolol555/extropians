ISRAELI SCIENTIST REPORTS DISCOVERY OF ADVANCE IN CODE BREAKING 
Israeli computer scientist Adi Shamir is expected to present a 
paper outlining the design of a yet-to-be-built-machine that could 
quickly decipher computer generated codes. Shamir -- who represents 
the 'S' in RSA encryption design -- will present his paper this week 
at the International Association for Cryptographic Research in 
Prague, which begins Monday. Shamir's idea would combine existing 
technology into a special task computer that would make factoring 
numbers as long as 150 digits much easier. As a result, codes accepted 
as reasonably secure for financial transactions and government 
communications would be much easier to decipher. Researchers say the 
machine could be built at a relatively low cost, and that key systems 
of 512 bits or less (keys of about 140 digits or less) would be 
vulnerable. Longer 1,024-bit keys would still be out of reach for 
Shamir's new machine. (New York Times 05/02/99)
