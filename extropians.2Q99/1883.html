Exactly; my fault for not thinking properly &lt;adjusted&gt;. Henrik
Öhrström pointed out that mesoscale nanomachines might actually pose a
hazard similar to silicosis or asbestosis by being fairly large
structures the macrophages in the lung cannot handle. I seem to recall
that the ufog designs involved inert foglets with silicon(?) shells;
maybe they should be made vulnerable to the chemicals released by
lymphocytes or other cells. Maybe some connectors made of protein, for
example.

<p>
<a name="1893qlink1">By the time ufog is a reality, wouldn't most people be chock full of
tiny little (nano) robots which collected debris in the lungs / poisons
in food / any other unruly stuff, and got rid</a> of it? Why not, instead of
trying to make ufog safe to digest, design a nano-robot scavenger that
catches debris and takes it out of harm's way?
