Three old men

<p>
Three old men were sitting on a bench in Florida when a reporter
approached them. 'I wonder if you three would be willing to do an
interview and tell us your secret to long life,' the reported asked.
The three old men agreed.

<p>
The first old man was asked his secret to his long life. 'I never drank
alcohol, I never smoked tobacco and I have been married to the same
woman for fifty years.' 'Wow, thats really remarkable!' said the
reporter. 'And how old are you?' he asked the second man. 'I'm 93,'
said the man.

<p>
The second man was asked the same question on his secret to long life.
<br>
'I drank on occasion, I smoked, but not often and I dated some.' 'And<br>
how old are you?' asked the reporter. 'I'm 91,' said the old man.

<p>
Finally, the reporter approached the third old man and asked his secret
to a long life. 'I dated every woman that would go out with me, I drank
until I passed out and I smoked three packs of cigarettes a day.'
<br>
'Wow!' said the reporter. 'And how old are you?' '29,' replied the man.<br>
