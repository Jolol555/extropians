<p>
The main areas I have objections to:
<br>
</a>a) divorce proceedings:<a name="2584qlink2"> You still assert that a person's 2nd amendment rights should
summarily be rescinded upon the serving of divorce papers or the issuance of a restraining
order. These are prior restraints which are most abhorrent  to any constitutional scholar or
federal judge. Only if multiple non-circumstantial peices of evidence of violent behavior
toward the spouse or children are submitted should any restraining order be grounds for
restriction of constitutional rights.</a>
<br>
<a name="2584qlink3">b) your dependence upon a non-governmental authority which is not restrained under public
review and representation to determine the sanity of an individual is as abhorrent as
putting such power in the hands of the government. this is clearly an unconstitutional
delegation of power.</a>
<br>
<a name="2584qlink4">c) you have yet to state what classes of violent criminals are in fact excluded. You have
made a rather vague and easily manipulated statement.</a>

<p>
<a name="2584qlink5">You say that my own positions are that of an outlaw. Well, they may be those of an outlaw as
perceived by a government that no longer respects the constitution, but I consider such a
government to itself be an outlaw and not deserving of my respect or obedience. Tell me,
under what conditions do YOU consider a government to be an outlaw government?</a>
