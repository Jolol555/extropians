I was watching one of those "follow your soul" programs on TV (OK, it
wasn't *that* bad, even though Norman Vincent Peale was on it.)  Anyway,
one of the speakers claimed that people who were giving and spent their
lives in service to others lived longer than others, and that there were
studies to prove it.

<p>
<a name="3811qlink1"><a name="3800qlink1">This is exactly the opposite of what I remember seeing; it's my memory
that researchers found that curmudgeonly, selfish, outspoken people
lived longer.  Thus, the stereotype of an old man yelling "You kids get
off my lawn!"  He's still around, while the nice old lady who baked
everyone cookies is presumably not.</a></a>

<p>
Anybody know more?  A web search turned up a lot of information about
long-lived dog breeds.
