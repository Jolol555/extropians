<a name="1901qlink1">Wait a minute Doug.  When I heard that Rotary Rocket planned to man
the *first* roton, I nearly choked.  I understand the reasoning behind
centrifugal pressurization and even autogyro landing, but the notion of
making the experimental vehicle manned, well the logic utterly escapes me.</a>

<p>
The thought that the first rotonaut to put his ass on the line might be
you, my friend I must object strenuously.<a name="1895qlink1">  I cannot imagine why Rotary
Rocket is persuing this seemingly reckless course, and I would
be deeply saddened if any harm should come to one who might
even be one of my distant cousins.</a>  All of us Joneses are distant
cousins {8-]  This is not intended as a criticism of the Roton;
we are behind you all the way.  But please explain why RR is
putting meat aboard on the first ride.  spike
