° Will the uncertainty principle of quantum physics make molecular machines 
unworkable?

<p>
This principle states (among other things) that particles can't be pinned 
down in an exact location for any length of time. It limits what molecular 
machines can do, just as it limits what anything else can do. Nonetheless, 
calculations show that the uncertainty principle places few important limits 
on how well atoms can be held in place, at least for the purposes outlined 
here. The uncertainty principle makes electron positions quite fuzzy, and in 
fact this fuzziness determines the very size and structure of atoms. An atom 
as a whole, however, has a comparatively definite position set by its 
comparatively massive nucleus. If atoms didn't stay put fairly well, 
molecules would not exist. One needn't study quantum mechanics to trust 
these conclusions, because molecular machines in the cell demonstrate that 
molecular machines work.

<hr>

<p>
Cells replicate. Their machines copy their DNA, which directs their 
ribosomal machinery to build other machines from simpler molecules. These 
machines and molecules are held in a fluid-filled bag. Its membrane lets in 
fuel molecules and parts for more nanomachines, DNA, membrane, and so forth; 
it lets out spent fuel and scrapped components. A cell replicates by copying 
the parts inside its membrane bag, sorting them into two clumps, and then 
pinching the bag in two. Artificial replicators could be built to work in a 
similar way, but using assemblers instead of ribosomes. In this way, we 
could build cell-like replicators that are not limited to molecular 
machinery made from the soft, moist folds of protein molecules.

<hr>

<p>
Some of these replicators will not resemble cells at all, but will instead 
resemble factories shrunk to cellular size. They will contain nanomachines 
mounted on a molecular framework and conveyor belts to move parts from 
machine to machine. Outside, they will have a set of assembler arms for 
building replicas of themselves, an atom or a section at a time.
