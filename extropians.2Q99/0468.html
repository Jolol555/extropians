Um, no, I'm always surprised when you jump in.

I send it to you for your edification.

<i>&gt;      I'll tell you how: he doesn't.</i><br>

<p>
Well, of course.


<p>
<i>&gt;      Also, define 'role playing' once you have VR in the picture.</i><br>

<p>
Um, hmm, this is a very good point.

<p>
VERY good.


<p>
<a href="0461.html#0468qlink2">&gt; &gt; 2) Most role playing will not be faithful simulations of history.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      There were lots of doubts expressed in this film about</i><br>
<i>&gt;      how 'faithful' the 'simulation' was.</i><br>

<p>
The other side is why go to ENORMOUS lengths to recreate history when it is FAR
easier to build an environment from the ground up?


<p>
But the matrix is a special case, the recreation made sense.


<p>
<i>&gt;      Trouble with VR is, it immediately makes lots of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      ordinary words become extremely loaded, among these:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      faithful</i><br>
<i>&gt;      simulation</i><br>
<i>&gt;      history</i><br>

<p>
truth
<br>
knowledge
<br>
identity
<br>
sanity




<p>
<a href="0461.html#0468qlink3">&gt; &gt; 3) Most history simulation role playing VR will not be done by</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    amnesiacs who honestly don't remember that its just a simulation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Oh, so you'd have a little reminder process that every</i><br>
<i>&gt;      morning would remind you that you are in VR ?</i><br>

<p>
I'm assuming you would have something SOMEWHERE letting you know which reality
you are in.


<p>
<i>&gt;      If the 'simulation' was that strong, it would take a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;      strong mind NOT to forget over time.</i><br>

<p>
This is my point.



<p>
<a href="0461.html#0468qlink4">&gt; &gt; 4) Most amnesia history role playing won't be done with thousands of</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    people over decades of time.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      I don't care.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      VR is for playing Gods anyway.</i><br>

<p>
Absolutely.
<br>
Why fuck around with being Caesar (smelly italian dude in an era before
anything approaching medicine was around) when you can REALLY, CONVINCINGLY be
Shiva, destroyer of Worlds?


<p>
<i>&gt; Aw, Robin, you're being way to literally minded here. VR is already used</i><br>
<a href="0461.html#0468qlink5">&gt; for role playing in VR chat, and the trend in video games is that VR</a><br>
<i>&gt; will be the state of the art in video games, and role playing is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; form of long duration gaming of choice.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Sex and Action Games will be the primary drivers for VR.</i><br>

<p>
yuppo.
<br>
And drergs.



<p>
<i>&gt;      The Military and Medical sides of things will pincer in</i><br>
<i>&gt;      from their own high-budget-but-shortsighted angles, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      the two will eventually meet and produce IT.</i><br>

<p>
Which is what we are seeing right now.


<p>
<i>&gt;      Then all the technology will be thrown out a few years</i><br>
<i>&gt;      down the track as UpLoading becomes possible.</i><br>

<p>
Well, the physical interface bit will, but that will only be about 10% of the
process.  the creation of synthetic environments parts will still be necessary
and useful.


<p>
<a href="0461.html#0468qlink6">&gt; As for the amnesia part, well, think about this: Take an 8 year old kid</a><br>
<i>&gt; and stick him on a VR system for his education and entertainment, heck</i><br>
<i>&gt; even for use for his physical fitness training, and by the time he's 18</i><br>
<i>&gt; he won't know what is really reality. Real reality will seem blase,</i><br>
<i>&gt; generic, vanilla compared to VR.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Different.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      We need to get people away from this Black/White Real/Fake</i><br>
<i>&gt;      mentality.  A VR world is in a _different_ universe, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;      necessarily a better or worse one.</i><br>

<p>
Yeah, I mean there's acid casualties, and there's Not Fuckwits.


<p>
<a href="0461.html#0468qlink7">&gt; &gt; Really, instead of role-playing, VR will mostly be used to fascilitate</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other goals.  Shopping, travel, social gatherings, sales meetings, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      All that boring shit nobody cares about.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, but it is what pays the bills.


<p>
<i>&gt;      VR will be able to 'tart it up' somewhat, but it won't</i><br>
<i>&gt;      be VR's main stock in trade.</i><br>

<p>
Yes it will, same as right now most people are out there making money, not
playing games.


<p>
<i>&gt;  'Role playing', a very crude</i><br>
<i>&gt;      term here, _is_ primarily what it will be used for, its</i><br>
<i>&gt;      just that 'Role Playing' will merge into normal life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Well, post Direct-Injection and on into UpLoading anwyay.</i><br>

<p>
I would suggest that it's really all people are doing now, when you think about
it.

<p>
we are clever apes who figured out how to go beyond hunting and gathering,
really.


<p>
<i>&gt;      And for gawds sake, all of you:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Permutation City</i><br>
<i>&gt;           &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Diaspora</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Both by Greg Egan.  They say EVERYTHING there pretty much is to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;      said about VR, and also about the metaphysics that make VR a part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; information  physics and the universe at large.</i><br>

<p>
I'm sure they are pretty familiar with them.
