<p>
Mike Lorrey reveals,

<p>
<a href="1359.html#1365qlink1">"Its not you forcing your view on anyone that is offensive, but that your</a><br>
view is that people should be forced to change, as well as your view that
anyone who doesn't agree to be forced to change is obviously insane and
in need of help. You are hopelessly infected by the statist memes that
most of us here deplore."

<p>
I don't recall ever advocating forcing anyone to change.  For whatever
reason (perhaps you guys could tell me) I am being interpreted in a way
that is very different from how I actually am.  I have always expressed
that I think it is wrong to force others to do things; I always prefer
using persuasion and giving people what they want in exchange for what I
want.  

<p>
I never expressed nor do I feel that people who disagree with me are
<br>
"obviously insane".  I realize that disagreements are an inevitable<br>
result of having unique ways of thinking and having access to different
information and ideas.

<p>
I haven't noticed that I am hopelessly infected by "statist memes"; I
deplore them as much as anyone on this list.

<p>
I feel like a straw man about to be burned at the stake by you guys.

<p>
Please consider that perhaps I am not really the statist bastard you are
trying to make me out to be. 

<p>
Thank you.
