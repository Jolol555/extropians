Your speculations about (as I interpret you) galaxies and galactic clusters 
being, if not strictly "living" then nonetheless quasi-alive, as well as the 
cosmos as a whole, is quite interesting.  The late Fred Wesson has a book 
called *Cosmos &amp; MetaCosmos* (OpenCourt) which flirts with this, as does 
some recent stuff by Dave Deutsch (See his *The Fabric of Reality*, 
Penguin/Allan Lane), and of course there's Peter Russell's stuff (highly 
recommended) and, of course, the granddaddy is none other than Alfie N. 
Whitehead.  As RAW (i.e., Robert Anton Wilson) said years ago in his classic 
<br>
*Cosmic Trigger*:<br>
<br>
SOMETHING'S going on---there certainly seems to be some sort of 
quasi-intentionality going.  And, no, this is not just a re-hash of Bergson 
or McTaggart.  Wesson (op.cit.) goes into this well, and see also George 
Leonard's *The Silent Pulse.*  Also important is Saul_paul Sirag's stuff on 
hyperspatial geometry/topology  (Which is, admittedly damn near above MY 
head anyway---I'm treading water as I read it---but it's still damn 
interesting stuff.  (Sorry I don't have this exact cite, but I'll dig it up 
and post it later)

<p>
Thank you very much for YOUR contribution; I hope you find the bibliographic 
rifs useful.

<p>
And thank all of you for reading this---or if you deleted it w/o reading 
it--woops, oh well!


<p>
Best regards to all,
