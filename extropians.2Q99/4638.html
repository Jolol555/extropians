<a name="4649qlink1">This sounds like a job for The Extropian Pharmacist! (That's me.)</a>

<p>
DepoProvera is the chemical castration agent of choice in treating sex
offenders.
<br>
Primary side effects are the result of blocking testoterone, allowing
endogenous estrogens (yes, males produce some) to act unopposed.
Increased body fat, loss of muscle mass, loss of body hair &amp;
gynecomastia (female breast growth) are
<br>
most noticable;  there are increased risks for various cancers, some of
which are promoted by estrogen.

<p>
A less drastic approach would involve trying selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Prozac,which have a high incidence
of decreasing libido.

<p>
<a name="4649qlink2">A more theoretical approach would be to increase your soy protein
intake;  soy products are high in natural estrogens &amp; might produce the
effects you're looking for without the more extreme side effects.
</a>

<p>
You might try consulting a reputable herbalist, as many herbs contain
natural estrogens too, &amp; might be suitable.
