No. I'm just gathering information at this point.

Good for you, but that doesn't help me, does it?

<a name="4672qlink1">I didn't say I didn't enjoy sex. I said I didn't like being dominated by my
hormones. I'm a happily married man (18 years). If I could flip a switch and
not have to evaluate every female I see as "doable" or not--even though I
have no intention whatsoever of actually "doing" her--I'd be happier than I
am now. If I could see a pretty woman and not stare at her, that'd be great.
If I could concentrate on the task at hand in the presence of women, rather
than fantasize about them, I'd be happier.</a></a>

Again, that's not the point. I'm aware of the contraception options. The
point was that since I'm done with the reproductive stage of my life, I
wouldn't mind being done also with the basic urges that are programmed into
me to encourage me to reproduce. I.e., I'd like to be in better control of
my mind and body.

<p>
Surely that's Extropian.
