Actually, many of the most enduringly popular superheroes fall into the
category you mention. Spiderman, IronMan, Batman, even (debatably) the
Hulk. And of course, one of my personal favorites - Arthur (aka "That
bunny-moth guy"). Almost all *my* created superhero-rpg characters were
"self-made", but that probably has to do with the fact that I did most of
my Champions and GURPS (How could you guys have neglected to mention that
system!) playing while at MIT. The idea of building a powered suit or
modifying one's genetic structure at will came naturally, because you saw
people working on similar projects all the time.

Actually, the Marvel/DC universes are filled with the technology of Iron
Man's original-alter-ego (Drake Industries) and the Fantastic Four's
corporation, for example. But since the writers want to immerse the reader
in a close analog of the actual world, they have to downplay the ubiquity
of this stuff.</a></a>

<p>
Also, although the tales of the Legion of Superheroes are placed centuries
hence, they do group science/engineering and make the results of such work
available to the population at large. There was(is?) a group of MIT
engineers/scientists that called themselves the LoSH and volunteered their
services to do things like help create technology implementation plans for
public schools and the like.

<a name="0676qlink2">It is interesting to note that many of the people with whom I played
supe-rpgs in college are now involved in creating *real-world* super-powers
for humans (usually, however, in the form of improved tools/processes
through advanced engineering). I myself, seem to have been subliminally
most influenced by Star Trek, as I now make part of my living (such as it
is) designing and building tricorder-like devices (aka mobile CCS
(computing/communication/sensing)).</a>
