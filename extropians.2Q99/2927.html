<a name="2992qlink1">What most people fear about non-registered guns is not Mr. Gun</a> Owner shooting 
<a name="2992qlink2">off kneecaps, or (no matter what people claim) insane people and maladjusted 
highschool Doomlord gamers shooting up middle America.<a name="2991qlink1"> "The Biggest Rational 
Fear" from *citizens* is if Mr. Gun Owner starts a lucrative business of 
RESALE of guns (to criminals).</a>

</a>
<p>
<a name="2991qlink2">They aren't as afraid of zealous Mr. Gun Owner himself, for he is "one of 
us"...(though you foreigners are right to fear him<a name="3203qlink2"> - remember the dead 
Japanese tourist who broke down on the highway and walked up to a home to 
call for help, Oops!! -- he thought "Freeze" meant "please"</a> ?) ..  MOSTLY 
</a>
<a name="2991qlink3">what one SHOULD fear is the thousands of accidental shootings Mr. Gun Owner's 
</a>kids incur (My uncle's boy had such an incident, and try telling a Native 
American that our government should be trusted to decide who carries guns). 
Regulation and Liscence comforts people, it represents control, weapons 
training, proper handling. But who should control? Big Daddy?

<p>
(...history showing that a govt' that disarms it's polulace turns despotic. 
Separation of church and state, right to bear arms.) 

<p>
Which is scarier? 

<p>
<a name="2991qlink4"><a name="2930qlink1">But guns are clearly out of control and our country is insane. We need</a> to do 
SOMETHING.
</a>

<p>
If, after hearing that Mr. Gun Owner wants to shoot my kneecaps off for 
tasering him (or possibly for a less harmful but more humiliating activity 
like hitting him with a nerf ball, taking his twinkies or kicking him in the 
shins) I decide Mr. Gun Owner is a bad candidate to hand over a weapon to, 
what kind of force should I apply to, if not the govt.? A private agency? 
Looky Anarcho-Capitalists:  a Private Entrepeneur Opportunity!!
