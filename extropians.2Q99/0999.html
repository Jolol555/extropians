Anything that can be cut can also be sewn. It is mathematically 
possible to take two black hole geometries, and sew them together 
along their "tears". This gives rise to wormhole solutions to 
Einstein's equations, in which two otherwise separate "universes" are 
connected by a throat, or tunnel, as shown in the top figure above. 
Such wormholes could also connect different regions of the same 
universe, as in the bottom picture. In principle this would enable us 
to take shortcuts to distant parts of the Universe just like they do 
in Star Trek. The problem is that within Einstein's theory such 
wormholes are very unstable. The throats tend to collapse in a much 
shorter time than it would take to get through to the other side, so 
that traversing such wormholes is in practice impossible. 

<p>
This then is how Einstein's gravity works. In the word's of John 
Wheeler: Matter tells space how to curve, and space tells matter how 
to move. So what is a black hole in this context? Clearly the more 
matter I put in the center of the sheet, the deeper the well that I 
create, and the harder it is for matter to "climb out" . According to 
Einstein's theory, if I pack enough matter into a small enough 
volume, the well will get so deep that the matter inside can never 
escape. A circle of no return forms. Any matter that passes the point 
of no return can no longer escape to the outside world. It 
necessarily keeps collapsing, moving towards the center. The well 
<a name="1048qlink1">gets deeper and deeper until finally a hole is literally torn in the 
fabric of spacetime: the density of matter at the center becomes 
essentially inifinite, at least to the extent that Einstein's theory 
of gravity is still valid. Thus, what I mean by " a hole in the 
fabric of spacetime" is: a tiny region of space where the known laws 
of physics break down. A black hole is a region of space so tightly 
packed with matter, that nothing, not even light can escape. Hidden 
at its (crunchy?) center is a tear in the fabric of spacetime. 
Anything that falls into this region of space is irrevocably lost to 
the rest of the universe. No light can emerge or pass through this 
region, so it appears totally black. In some sense therefore, a black 
hole marks a boundary to spacetime: a horizon beyond which no one can 
see without travelling through it. This radius of no return is called 
the event horizon of the black hole.</a>
