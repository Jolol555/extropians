"Elements 116 and 118 discovered at Berkeley Lab":

<i>&gt; BERKELEY, CA — Discovery of two new "superheavy" elements has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; announced by scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence</i><br>
<i>&gt; Berkeley National Laboratory. Element 118 and its immediate decay</i><br>
<i>&gt; product, element 116, were discovered at Berkeley Lab's 88-Inch</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cyclotron by bombarding targets of lead with an intense beam of</i><br>
<i>&gt; high-energy krypton ions. Although both new elements almost instantly</i><br>
<i>&gt; decay into other elements, the sequence of decay events is consistent</i><br>
&gt; with theories that have long predicted an "island of stability" for nuclei<br>
&gt; with approximately 114 protons and 184 neutrons.<br>

"Transplanted neural stem cells migrate throughout the abnormal brain,
reduce disease symptoms":

<i>&gt; For years, researchers have probed the mysteries of neural stem cells --</i><br>
<i>&gt; immature cells that can differentiate into all the cell types that make up</i><br>
<i>&gt; the brain -- with the idea that they might be useful for treating brain</i><br>
<i>&gt; disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Important new animal research</i><br>
<i>&gt; now suggests that these cells may be effective in treating a much</i><br>
&gt; broader array of brain diseases than previously anticipated, including<br>
&gt; Alzheimer's disease and many childhood brain disorders. <br>
[...]
<br>
<i>&gt; In the new study, Dr. Snyder and his colleagues injected cultured neural</i><br>
<i>&gt; stem cells into the brain ventricles of newborn mice from a mutant</i><br>
<i>&gt; strain that develops severe tremors by 2 to 3 weeks of age. The tremor</i><br>
<i>&gt; develops because the mice lack a key protein needed to make myelin, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; insulating coating that surrounds nerve fibers. The lack of normal myelin</i><br>
<i>&gt; in these mice mimics the defect seen in many human demyelinating</i><br>
<i>&gt; disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and a group of childhood disorders</i><br>
<i>&gt; called leukodystrophies. The researchers found that most of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; transplanted cells migrated throughout the brain and matured into</i><br>
<i>&gt; normal-looking oligodendrocytes, the brain cells that produce myelin.</i><br>
<i>&gt; These oligodendrocytes produced a significant amount of the missing</i><br>
<i>&gt; protein and began to cover nearby nerve fibers with myelin just as normal</i><br>
<i>&gt; oligodendrocytes would. Moreover, tremors disappeared almost</i><br>
&gt; completely in 60 percent of the tested mice that received the<br>
&gt; transplants. <br>
