Don't worry Gina, its impossible to get through life without pissing some people
off. With an unmoderated free list of this size, you will always get people who
are hypersensitive to certain words or subjects or opinions, even when they
considered by many, if not most, to be important to the ideas/reasons for the
list in the first place. There will also always be people who refuse to be
confused by the facts, or who are only interested in picking fights or arguing,
even with people who mostly agree with them.

<p>
I personally find it rather amusing, in a sad way, how a body of people who a
few years ago were active in fighting online censorship, political correctness
in general, and promoting personal freedom, are now afraid to say the g-word.
Does this make me an oppressed minority now? Can I get on the government gravy
train? ;)
