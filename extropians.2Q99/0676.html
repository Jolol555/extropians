<a href="0514.html#0676qlink1">&gt;I can't believe that after lurking for months, *this* is the message that</a><br>
<i>&gt;inspired me to send something </i><br>

<p>
	Coincidence strikes twice&gt; me too. As you so correctly pointed out&gt; our
kulture's ART is the first wave of reality actualizing from the infinite
quantum probability field, our memetic rudder to filter/translate across
the canvas. 
<p>
	Or&gt; superheroes inphected my reality browser at the same time I learnt
language&gt; they're the triggers for my phuture Archetype.  They've been
one of the most penetrating artforms of the 20th century marketplace
because they are so disposable and archetypal, which means a lot of
heads have been tweaked already to the idea. If we're all
imagining/recreating ourselves its through the memes of our zeitgeist,
and superheroes are like ideational bombs&gt;the idea of them transforms
the reality.  And the IDEA of them is proto-Transhuman, it gives a broad
genre framework with which to imagine in the rawest chunks of pure
inphomation, to push the kulture's understanding of postumanism. The
details can always be concretized later when the teknology has caught
up, which is almost the point we're at.


<p>
<a href="0514.html#0676qlink2">&gt;It is interesting to note that many of the people with whom I played</a><br>
<i>&gt;supe-rpgs in college are now involved in creating *real-world* super-powers</i><br>
<i>&gt;for humans (usually, however, in the form of improved tools/processes</i><br>
<i>&gt;through advanced engineering). I myself, seem to have been subliminally</i><br>
<i>&gt;most influenced by Star Trek, as I now make part of my living (such as it</i><br>
<i>&gt;is) designing and building tricorder-like devices (aka mobile CCS</i><br>
<i>&gt;(computing/communication/sensing)).</i><br>
<i>&gt;but they are great symbols for self-improvement.</i><br>

<p>
	Yep. The Love of Art Shall Save the Earth!
