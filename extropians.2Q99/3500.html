<i>&gt; they tell you. There is one word to describe such a society: fascism.</i><br>


<p>
Jesus what a load of something I'm not allowed to mention.

<p>
So tell me, Mr Superman Lorrey with your World Famous LorreyDrive: how
the hell do YOU with your Big! Manly! Testosterone-Oozing! Guns! plan to
keep the government at bay? Do you brazenly watch kiddie snuff porn and
ingest drugs while listening to Hakim Bey read the communist manifesto,
proud and secure in your knowledge that you can keep these dastardly
forces of oppression from the door?


<p>
This is so much complete toss. you maniacs rant and rave about freedom!
and liberty! and strength! and yet you are under the thumb of the
country which imprisons more of it's own than everyone else aside from
Russia, and you are scheduled to pass that figure in October.

<p>
<a name="3524qlink2">So I ask you again: how have *your* guns prevented government
oppression? How *will* your guns prevent government oppression.  do you
really think you have enough firepower to hold off a military force? 
Sure the swiss own guns, but they have military weapons: you guys don't.</a>



<p>
<a name="3524qlink3"><a href="3385.html#3500qlink2">&gt; &gt; No one needs to have weapons to kill people at a distance.  The only</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reason to have them is to protect yourself from people who have them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Argh, shit, I'm being sucked into this stupid argument again!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Its a matter of you refusing to acknowledge your own blind spots. Who protects you</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the government? </i><br>

<p>
The laws, the army and the police.  What on earth makes you think that
we could hold off the govt? Do you think you and your gun-totin' mates
can hold of yours?</a>


<p>
<a name="3524qlink4"><a href="3385.html#3500qlink3">&gt; From the criminals who do not obey your laws against gun</a><br>
<i>&gt; ownership? </i><br>


<p>
Um, what makes you think that criminals would defend the people against
</a>
the govt?  Or are you engaging in yet more sophistry?


<p>
<a name="3524qlink5">If it comes down to having to build weapons to defend myself from the
govt, I can assure you I will build something a hell of a lot more
powerful than a rifle, because I'm aware of something you seem to be
ignorant of: rifles won't stop tanks and fighter aircraft.  Until then I
will quite happily live in my safe, peaceful, disarmed community.</a> 

<p>
&gt; Get a new newscaster yet?<br>

<p>
Why do you ask this? Last I checked transmissions work just fine.

Yeah, right, it's easy to spout gibberish like this with an army at your
back.
