<i>&gt;Meet one of the creators of wearable computing and join him in his search</i><br>
<i>&gt;for like-minded folks to live in an augmented reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By Steve Mann</i><br>

<a href="http://www.wearcomp.org/">http://www.wearcomp.org/</a>


<br>
<i>&gt;People find me peculiar. They think it=92s odd that I spend most of my</i><br>
<a href="1470.html#1491qlink2">&gt;waking</a><br>
<i>&gt;hours wearing eight or nine Internet-connected computers sewn into my</i><br>
<i>&gt;clothing and that I wear opaque wrap-around glasses day and night, inside</i><br>
<i>&gt;and outdoors. They find it odd that to sustain wireless communications</i><br>
<i>&gt;during my travels, I will climb to the hotel roof to rig my room with an</i><br>
<i>&gt;antenna and Internet connection. They wonder why I sometimes seem detached</i><br>
<i>&gt;and lost, but at other times I exhibit vast knowledge of their specialty.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A</i><br>
<i>&gt;physicist once said he felt that I had the intelligence of a dozen experts</i><br>
<i>&gt;in his discipline; a few minutes later, someone else said they thought I</i><br>
<i>&gt;was</i><br>
<i>&gt;mentally handicapped.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Despite the peculiar glances I draw, I wouldn=92t live any other way. I=</i><br>
 have
<br>
<a href="1470.html#1491qlink3">&gt;melded technology with my person and achieved a higher state of awareness</a><br>
<i>&gt;than would otherwise be possible. I see the world as images imprinted onto</i><br>
<i>&gt;my retina by rays of light controlled by several computers, which in turn</i><br>
<i>&gt;are controlled by cameras concealed inside my glasses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Every morning I decide how I will see the world that day. Sometimes I give</i><br>
<i>&gt;myself eyes in the back of my head. Other days I add a sixth sense, such</i><br>
<i>&gt;as</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ability to feel objects at a distance. If I=92m going to ride my</i><br>
<i>&gt;bicycle,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I=92ll want to feel the cars and trucks pressing against my back, even when</i><br>
<i>&gt;they are a few hundred feet away.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Things appear different to me than they do to other people. I see some</i><br>
<i>&gt;items</i><br>
<i>&gt;as hyperobjects that I can click on and bring to life. I can choose</i><br>
<i>&gt;stroboscopic vision to freeze the motion of rotating automobile tires and</i><br>
<i>&gt;see how many bolts are on the wheels of a car going over 60 miles per</i><br>
<i>&gt;hour,</i><br>
<i>&gt;as if it were motionless. I can block out the view of particular</i><br>
<i>&gt;objects=97sparing me the distraction, for example, of the vast sea of</i><br>
<i>&gt;advertising around me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I live in a videographic world, as if my entire life were a television</i><br>
<i>&gt;show.</i><br>
<i>&gt;And many people assume that by living my life through the screen, I do</i><br>
<i>&gt;exactly what television leads us to do=97tune out reality. In fact,=</i><br>
 WearComp
<br>
<a href="1470.html#1491qlink4">&gt;has quite the opposite effect: Visual filters help me concentrate on what</a><br>
<i>&gt;is</i><br>
<i>&gt;important, heightening my sensitivity and setting my imagination free. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;do</i><br>
<i>&gt;of course have occasion to remove my computational prostheses, as when I</i><br>
<i>&gt;sleep, shower or splash around in the ocean.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In addition to having the Internet and massive databases and video at my</i><br>
<i>&gt;beck and call most of the time, I am also connected to others. While I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;grocery shopping, my wife=97who may be at home or in her office=97sees=</i><br>
 exactly
<br>
<a href="1470.html#1491qlink5">&gt;what I see and helps me pick out vegetables. She can imprint images onto</a><br>
<i>&gt;my</i><br>
<i>&gt;retina while she is seeing what I see. I hope to add to the population of</i><br>
<i>&gt;similarly equipped people; last fall at the University of Toronto, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;taught</i><br>
<i>&gt;what I believe to be the world=92s first course for cyborgs (see sidebar</i><br>
<i>&gt;=93School for Cyborgs=94).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Much of my passion has been fueled by a desire to restore some balance of</i><br>
<i>&gt;privacy in a world where individuals are increasingly affronted by</i><br>
<i>&gt;government surveillance and corporate encroachments. In fact, one goal of</i><br>
<i>&gt;my</i><br>
<i>&gt;work was to challenge the notion of totalitarian video surveillance=97the</i><br>
<i>&gt;now-common practice of a corporate or governmental establishment wishing</i><br>
<i>&gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt;know everything about everyone in the establishment while revealing</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt;about itself. Many department stores, for example, use large numbers of</i><br>
<i>&gt;hidden cameras and yet prohibit customers from taking pictures.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I attempted to draw attention to this phenomenon of unreciprocated video</i><br>
<i>&gt;surveillance in Shooting Back, a documentary I made during my day-to-day</i><br>
<i>&gt;life in several different countries over a period of many years. Whenever</i><br>
<i>&gt;I</i><br>
<i>&gt;found myself in a store or some other establishment with electronic eyes</i><br>
<i>&gt;perusing the premises, I asked its management why they were taking</i><br>
<i>&gt;pictures</i><br>
<i>&gt;of me without my permission. They would typically ask me why I was so</i><br>
<i>&gt;paranoid and tell me that only criminals are afraid of cameras. Of course</i><br>
<i>&gt;I</i><br>
<i>&gt;was covertly recording this response using my own hidden eyetap video</i><br>
<i>&gt;camera. Then I would pull an ordinary camcorder out of my satchel and give</i><br>
<i>&gt;them a chance to explain their position for the record. (The camcorder was</i><br>
<i>&gt;simply a prop, of course, as the eyetap camera had been capturing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;scene.) The same people who claimed that only criminals were afraid of</i><br>
<i>&gt;cameras had an instantly paranoid (and sometimes violent) reaction to my</i><br>
<i>&gt;camcorder. Shooting Back was, I believe, the first documentary to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;transmitted in real time to the World Wide Web while it was shot.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Selected</i><br>
<i>&gt;portions of Shooting Back may be viewed at</i><br>
<i>&gt;<a href="http://wearcam.org/shootingback.html">http://wearcam.org/shootingback.html</a>.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ahead of My Time</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Growing up during the 1960s and early 1970s, I always seemed to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;creating</i><br>
<i>&gt;things before their time. I grew up in Hamilton, Ontario=97a city on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;western tip of Lake Ontario about 100 kilometers from Toronto. I came by</i><br>
<i>&gt;this inclination naturally; during the early 1950s, my father had built</i><br>
<i>&gt;what</i><br>
<i>&gt;was perhaps the first wearable radio. (He had pursued radio as a hobby</i><br>
<i>&gt;since</i><br>
<i>&gt;his childhood.) He had taught me quite a bit about electronic circuits by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the time I started kindergarten. As a young child, I removed the head from</i><br>
<i>&gt;a</i><br>
<i>&gt;portable battery-powered dictating machine and replaced it with the head</i><br>
<i>&gt;from a high-fidelity audio cassette deck. From this cassette transport</i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanism, I built a system that enabled me to listen to music while</i><br>
<i>&gt;walking</i><br>
<i>&gt;around. While many people scoffed at this invention, I found it nice to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;able to drown out background music while shopping, to assert my own idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;of</i><br>
<i>&gt;personal space, and to defend myself from theft of my solitude by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;department stores with their Muzak.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In my teens I founded a concept of mediated reality, which I called</i><br>
<i>&gt;=93lightspace.=94 The goal of lightspace was to experience an altered</i><br>
<i>&gt;perception</i><br>
<i>&gt;of visual reality by exploring a large range of possible forms of</i><br>
<i>&gt;illumination while observing a scene or object from different viewpoints.</i><br>
<i>&gt;My</i><br>
<i>&gt;work with lightspace led to the invention of my wearable computer. My</i><br>
<i>&gt;desire</i><br>
<i>&gt;to create photographic instruments that would function as true extensions</i><br>
<i>&gt;of</i><br>
<i>&gt;my mind and body=97and my desire to control these photographic instruments</i><br>
<i>&gt;in</i><br>
<i>&gt;new ways=97created a need for the ability to program complex sequences of</i><br>
<i>&gt;events.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I began to take this matter seriously, building a digital computer from a</i><br>
<i>&gt;large number of electronic components salvaged from an old telephone</i><br>
<i>&gt;switching computer. I did much of this experimentation in the basement of</i><br>
<i>&gt;a</i><br>
<i>&gt;television repair shop where I spent much of my childhood as a volunteer,</i><br>
<i>&gt;fixing TV sets. In this shop I built up a great deal of knowledge about</i><br>
<i>&gt;electronic circuits.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The result of my early efforts was, in the early 1970s, a family of</i><br>
<i>&gt;wearable</i><br>
<i>&gt;computers I called =93WearComp0.=94 Sometimes I took these cumbersome</i><br>
<i>&gt;prototypes</i><br>
<i>&gt;outside in search of spaces dark enough to explore the altered perception</i><br>
<i>&gt;of</i><br>
<i>&gt;visual reality I could create using portable battery-powered light</i><br>
<i>&gt;sources.</i><br>
<i>&gt;People would cross the street to avoid me, not knowing what to make of</i><br>
<i>&gt;what</i><br>
<i>&gt;must have looked to them like an alien creature. The rig was physically a</i><br>
<i>&gt;burden, weighing as much or more than I did. After wearing one of these</i><br>
<i>&gt;encumbrances from sundown (when it got dark enough to use them) to</i><br>
<i>&gt;sunrise,</i><br>
<i>&gt;my feet would be swollen, blistered and bleeding.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I continued to refine WearComp0 and its evolutionary successor, WearComp1.</i><br>
<i>&gt;After much tinkering, I came up with WearComp2=97my first system that truly</i><br>
<i>&gt;qualified as a wearable computer in the sense that it was not just a</i><br>
<i>&gt;special</i><br>
<i>&gt;purpose device. WearComp2 was field programmable, with a full-function</i><br>
<i>&gt;input</i><br>
<i>&gt;device (a keyboard and joystick for cursor control both built into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;handle of an electronic flashgun), text and graphical displays, sound</i><br>
<i>&gt;recording and playback (crude, home-brew analog-to-digital and</i><br>
<i>&gt;digital-to-analog converters), and a wireless data connection to provide</i><br>
<i>&gt;links to other computers. I completed this system in 1981, before most of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the world realized that computers could be portable, much less wearable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Though an advance over my earlier prototype, WearComp2 was still a burden</i><br>
<i>&gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt;lug. I wanted to reduce its bulk and make it look more normal. This goal</i><br>
<i>&gt;led</i><br>
<i>&gt;me in 1982 to experiment with building components directly into clothing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I</i><br>
<i>&gt;learned how to make flexible circuits that could be embedded into ordinary</i><br>
<i>&gt;fabric. This work enabled me to make versions of WearComp that were not</i><br>
<i>&gt;only</i><br>
<i>&gt;more comfortable to walk around in but also less off-putting to others.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In spite of these advances, my life as a cyborg remained mostly solitary.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I</i><br>
<i>&gt;did connect quite literally (by serial data cable) with an understanding</i><br>
<i>&gt;woman during my freshman year at McMaster University in my hometown of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hamilton. We faced unusual challenges in this configuration, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;having</i><br>
<i>&gt;to choose which public restroom to use when we were joined. Thinking back,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I</i><br>
<i>&gt;imagine we must have made a comical sight, trying to negotiate doorways</i><br>
<i>&gt;without snagging the cable that tethered us together.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Such relationships were rare, and it was seldom that I could get others to</i><br>
<i>&gt;wear my seemingly strange contraptions. Many people were unable to get</i><br>
<i>&gt;past</i><br>
<i>&gt;my technological shell, which they apparently found more than a little</i><br>
<i>&gt;odd.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Still, multimediated reality had provided me with a unique vision of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world, and by the mid-1980s I had a following of people on the fringes of</i><br>
<i>&gt;society who shared (or at least appreciated) my vision. I was invited to</i><br>
<i>&gt;shoot pictures for album covers and hair ads. By 1985, I began to realize</i><br>
<i>&gt;that it wasn=92t just the finished photographs people wanted; they also</i><br>
<i>&gt;seemed</i><br>
<i>&gt;to enjoy watching me take the pictures. Often I would be shooting in large</i><br>
<i>&gt;warehouses, with audiences of hundreds of people. I began to realize that</i><br>
<i>&gt;I</i><br>
<i>&gt;had become a cyborg performance artist. By the end of the 1980s, however,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I</i><br>
<i>&gt;found myself yearning to return to my more substantive childhood passions</i><br>
<i>&gt;for science, mathematics and electrical engineering.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;While at McMaster, I added biosensors to the WearComp so that it could</i><br>
<i>&gt;monitor my heart rate (as well as the full EKG waveform) and other</i><br>
<i>&gt;physiological signals. I also invented the =93vibravest=94=97a garment=</i><br>
 studded
<br>
<a href="1470.html#1491qlink6">&gt;with radar transceivers and vibrating elements. Wearing this vest made</a><br>
<i>&gt;objects at a distance feel as if they were pressing against my body. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;could</i><br>
<i>&gt;close my eyes and walk down the hallway, confident that any wall or other</i><br>
<i>&gt;obstacle would be felt as warning vibrations on the appropriate side of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;vest. By sparing myself from the cognitive load of processing all that</i><br>
<i>&gt;visual information, I found I was able to think more clearly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In 1991, I brought my inventions to MIT as a PhD student. As a cyborg,</i><br>
<i>&gt;uprooting myself from Canada was a formidable task, since I had installed</i><br>
<i>&gt;my</i><br>
<i>&gt;cyberbody in Canada over a period of many years. Going to MIT was a sudden</i><br>
<i>&gt;move of my extended self.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;First, I secretly climbed up onto the rooftops of buildings around the</i><br>
<i>&gt;city</i><br>
<i>&gt;to put in place the wireless data communications infrastructure I had</i><br>
<i>&gt;brought with me from Canada. I had to quickly deploy my base stations at</i><br>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;top of elevator shafts or anywhere else I could find warm dry places. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;way, whenever I wanted an Internet connection, these gateways would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;ready</i><br>
<i>&gt;to send the data to me, no matter where I was=97even if I was in a basement</i><br>
<i>&gt;or</i><br>
<i>&gt;riding on the subway.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Although I kept in touch with my family through cyberspace, my first two</i><br>
<i>&gt;years at MIT were lonely times IRL=97in real life. I was, after all, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;only</i><br>
<i>&gt;person there with a wearable computer. Then in 1993, at the request of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;fellow student, a local engineer named Doug Platt built a wearable system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I</i><br>
<i>&gt;was no longer the only cyborg at MIT.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It took some years to get other cyborgs at MIT, thus enabling the</i><br>
<i>&gt;beginnings</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a sense of community. Although I never succeeded in getting a large</i><br>
<i>&gt;community outfitted with my high-speed packet radio systems, the cellular</i><br>
<i>&gt;telephones that began to emerge provided another answer to the problem of</i><br>
<i>&gt;connectivity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By the end of 1995, my work was attracting serious academic interest. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;was</i><br>
<i>&gt;asked to write an article about my work for IEEE Computer, a publication</i><br>
<i>&gt;of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers=92 Computer Society.=</i><br>
 I
<br>
<a href="1470.html#1491qlink7">&gt;also proposed an academic symposium on wearables and was referred to T.</a><br>
<i>&gt;Michael Elliott, executive director of the Computer Society. I figured</i><br>
<i>&gt;that</i><br>
<i>&gt;such a conference would legitimize the field, which until then had</i><br>
<i>&gt;consisted</i><br>
<i>&gt;in many people=92s minds of =93Steve, that crazy guy running around with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;camera on his head.=94 Elliott was enthusiastic about the idea and in 1996</i><br>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Computer Society responded with an overwhelming =93yes.=94 This marked a</i><br>
<i>&gt;turning</i><br>
<i>&gt;point in my acceptance by my professional peers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;More than 700 people attended this first IEEE-sponsored symposium on</i><br>
<i>&gt;wearable computing, held in Cambridge, Mass., in October 1997. A gala</i><br>
<i>&gt;=93Wearables=94 event the following day drew 3,000 people. In that same=</i><br>
 year I
<br>
<a href="1470.html#1491qlink8">&gt;received my doctorate from MIT in wearable computing. This was a</a><br>
<i>&gt;gratifying</i><br>
<i>&gt;culmination: I had turned a childhood hobby and passion into an MIT</i><br>
<i>&gt;project,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the topic of a conference, and a PhD dissertation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This past year I returned to Canada to pursue my work at the University of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Toronto. Why Toronto? I had lived there in the mid-1980s, and the city had</i><br>
<i>&gt;seemed very =93cyborg-friendly.=94 I had sensed there a cosmopolitan=</i><br>
 diversity
<br>
<a href="1470.html#1491qlink9">&gt;as well as a genuine warmth and openness that contrasted with the more</a><br>
<i>&gt;cyborg-hostile and tense atmosphere of some large U.S. cities.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Wearing Well</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Although I spent many years developing WearComp in relative isolation, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;welcome efforts to commercialize wearable computers. At the vanguard is</i><br>
<i>&gt;Xybernaut, based in Fairfax, Va. Xybernaut=92s latest model is being</i><br>
<i>&gt;manufactured by Sony, indicating that the Japanese electronics giant has</i><br>
<i>&gt;an</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest in what some believe will become the Walkman of computing. Last</i><br>
<i>&gt;May, Xybernaut organized its own conference on wearable computing (and</i><br>
<i>&gt;invited me to give the keynote address). I may also begin to license some</i><br>
<i>&gt;embodiments of my original WearComp, as well as many of my more recent</i><br>
<i>&gt;innovations, to companies who want to manufacture commercial systems. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;think it will be especially important to make the cyborg outfit less</i><br>
<i>&gt;cumbersome=97something that=92s long been a goal of mine. My latest version=</i><br>
 is
<br>
<a href="1470.html#1491qlink10">&gt;quite sleek, and looks just like ordinary bifocal eyeglasses, with the</a><br>
<i>&gt;eyetap point hidden along the cut line. Even when fully rigged, I can</i><br>
<i>&gt;still</i><br>
<i>&gt;play an acceptable game of squash.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I realize that some people see me and my invention as a potential</i><br>
<i>&gt;threat=97like the Borg of Star Trek fame: =93You will be assimilated.=94</i><br>
<i>&gt;Clearly,</i><br>
<i>&gt;there are important philosophical issues to be explored. Not only is there</i><br>
<i>&gt;the danger of the technology being used to monitor people to make them</i><br>
<i>&gt;into</i><br>
<i>&gt;obedient productive cyborgs, but there is also the potential that people</i><br>
<i>&gt;will become too dependent on this technology. My goal as a responsible</i><br>
<i>&gt;inventor and engineer, however, has always been to encourage the</i><br>
<i>&gt;development</i><br>
<i>&gt;and manufacture of wearable computers as a means of personal, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;institutional, empowerment. That will make worthwhile all the obstacles</i><br>
<i>&gt;and</i><br>
<i>&gt;challenges I have faced during my more than 20 years of developing this</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I hope that if I bring WearComp to market, anyone who wishes to will</i><br>
<i>&gt;eventually be able to become a cyborg. We=92ll live in a collaborative</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer-mediated reality that will allow us to no longer need to</i><br>
<i>&gt;distinguish between cyberspace and the real world. And then this cyborg</i><br>
<i>&gt;will</i><br>
<i>&gt;have lots of company.</i><br>
