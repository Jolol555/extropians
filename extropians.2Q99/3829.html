Well, Joe, I seem to recall that Mike [Lorrey] has (already!) *CONCEDED* (in 
one of his responses to one of my interjections) that (correct me if I'm 
mistaken here, Mike) criminals convicted of violent crimes may be 
legitimately denied access to guns (and other weapons) not only while 
incarcerated, but also while on parole, probation, ankle-braceletted 
house-confignment, or whatever.  It's after they've COMPLETELY served their 
time, and are fully FREE(D) that the gray area(s) begin(s) (for me and Mike, 
anyway, though perhaps not for you, Joe).  A FORMER convict presumptively 
has at least MOST if not, indeed, ALL his natural/constitutional rights 
FULLY restored (or at least many libertarians would argue that s/he SHOULD 
so have, anyway).  Yet, this implies that s/he does, now once and yet again, 
have the right to "keep and bear arms."  Now I myself am genuinely 
ambivalent on this particular point, because I sympathize with BOTH sides of 
the issue to a fairly great extent.  On the one hand, if the person, having 
completely served their time, etc., etc., notwithstanding, is not 
sufficiently rehabilitated/civilized, then there is a (way the hell 
NON-ZERO!!) probability that they'll (eventually) resort to (aggressive) 
violence again.  And when I put on my consequentialist jurisprudence hat, so 
to speak, then I'm very tempted to say, IN THIS PARTICULAR CONTEXT, that 
PRE-EMPTIVE, preclusionary law is needed to see to it that this (kind of) 
fellow doesn't gain (legal, rightful) access to firearms.  But there are 
several caveats/problems here: (1) Arguably, from a META-constitutional 
perspective, what I propose might very well require some sort of 
constiutional amendment or it would not be legitimate. (This question ALONE 
is, from a libertarian/eudaimonist (meta)jurisprudential perspective, rather 
a hornet's nest!!  I.E., e.g., how to tailor such a law as to (non)vagness 
and (to avoid) overbreadth, etc.  And this is really just the TIP of the 
(meta)constitutional/(meta)jurisprudential iceberg!!)  I think Mike would 
concur that some sort of constitutional amendment-type solution might very 
well be required here for full legitimacy.
<a name="3942qlink5">(2)  How do you determine whether a person is ("sufficiently")</a> rehabilitated 
before according them full (constitutional) rights?  I sympathize with YOU 
(Joe) about the problem of (in effect) PRESUMING that a violent-crime(s) 
ex-con is sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant full re-instatement of 
his/her rights (incl. 2nd amend. rights).  But any practical alternative (at 
least with *1st-offenders*) would seem much too likely to slippery-slope 
(slip by [perhaps small, incremental] slip) into rather draconian, 
more-or-less fascist laws and implementation thereof (i.e., e.g. you could 
eventually have a close parallel to the "Sacharov atrocity," wherein someone 
who nonetheless IS genuinely rehabilitated, etc., is denied 2nd amend. 
rights (and/or other rights)  simply because they are out-of-favor with the 
de facto (jurisprudential) power structure/elite).  Now admittedly, in a 
good (though not perfect) Tannahill/Barnett, "polycentric" jurisprudential 
setting, this might be less likely to happen, BUT Cf. the dialog (a few 
volumes/years ago ['96 or '97, I think] in the journal ECONOMICS &amp; 
PHILOSOPHY between Tyler Cowen and Dave Friedman on the viability of 
full-fledged ANARCHIST jurisprudence.  Bottom line:  how do you 
(PRE-EMPTIVELY[?!?!]) "weed out" the "baddies" with a high (closely 
approaching ONE) probability of committing violence (with or without 
firearms) again, without endangering/infringing-the-hell-out-of the 
(reasonable and legitimate, I should think) rights of the truly 
rehabilitated?!

<p>
(3) With *Nth-time* offenders, however, I have much less of a problem (and I 
would think that Mike, and others herein, might feel similarly).  If a 
guy/gal has a multiple frickin' track record of violence (especially with 
deadly weapons, but perhaps not specifically necessarily), then it should be 
all the more (meta)jurisprudentially permissible to (permanently??) deny the 
hell of his 2nd amend. right(s).  But here again, it is argueable that this 
might still require a constitutional amend. to pass muster.  And it would 
still have to pass the (NON)vaguness and (NON)overbreadth requirements, as 
well as carefully attend to the (possible potential toward) "Sacharov 
atrocity"-type crap as in (2)above.

<p>
Would WELCOME Joe's, Mike's, *et al* feedback here!

<p>
In closing, though, Joe, please be assured that I do indeed sympathize with 
your stuff, and always look forward to your postings (and this goes for just 
about everyone else, too; but especially to Mike, Brian (Williams), and 
Mark@unicorn on the "gun stuff."  And to Gina the Nanogirl, Anders, hal, and 
Emlyn (among others): thanks for all your stuff.  Hotmail is perpetually 
after me, 'cause I try to keep most of the postings here for as long as I 
can!

<p>
Very best regards to all!
