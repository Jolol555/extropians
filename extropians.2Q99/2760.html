I can see why hydrogen is easy to use - it's just a proton when ionized,
and can be exchanged easily to drive current flow. I guess what I am really
looking for is some chemistry that can take a more complex and more easily
stored/handled hydrocarbon and convert all of the bond energy as combustion
does, but use the energy to drive the electron pump. I am not enough of a
chemist to even guess if this is possible.

<a name="2792qlink4">50% of the bond energy due to reforming a fuel to hydrogen, we get better
overall efficiency with the fuel cell. I just get itchy when ANY energy
gets thrown away without a chance to do work.

<a name="2846qlink2">If I recall right, large methane fueled fuel cells were proposed for
installation in New York City to generate power - and the waste heat could
then be used for process or building heat. Does anyone know if this scheme
was actually installed?
