<p>
To follow on from my recent message asking this community to employ its
intelligence and creativity to improving the list, here are some additional
thoughts:

<p>
I continue to like the NodeNet idea, implemented as a web-based set of
boards.. I also like Robin's Hanson's urging of posting of well-developed
papers and essays. We used to have an ExI-Essay list for this purpose,
which perhaps should be revived.

<p>
While we (that is a small handful of ExI officers *and* any all of your
willing to step up and help) work towards implementing a web-based NodeNet
structure, or similar, here's a possibility:

<p>
Shut down &lt;extropians@extropy.org&gt; while we reevaluate its function. I do
not feel comfortable having people see it as ExI's main list. It does not
represent the quality and civility that I desire for ExI. Instead, an
immediate replacement might be &lt;extropians-chat@extropy.org&gt; where anything
goes (other than libel, of course). This would, at first, amount to little
more than a change in name, but would move in the right direction.

<p>
Following that, to move towards the NodeNet idea of focused forums -- even
before we determine whether a web-based implementation is feasible for us
-- we may want to create a substantial "portfolio" of topic-specific lists
with clear rules. The g-topic will be perfectly appropriate on a list
devoted to political freedom, for example.

<p>
<a name="4087qlink1">You could help with the above idea by suggesting possible ontologies for
the set of focused lists. This is not a simple matter. Should there be a
single list for all discussions of technologies, or divide this into nano,
AI, computer tech, biotech, etc. (but drawing those distinctions will
sometimes be difficult). Aside from technology/technologies, there might be
a list on alernative social and economic systems, one on philosophical
issues, or several that divide these into sub-topics.</a>

<p>
Again, I think this would work best with a web interface that lets you view
any of the forums you choose, in order to maintain a sense of community,
along with essays and articles to stimulate list discussions. But we could
begin simply by starting and expanding on regular email lists. My earliest
suggestion for what I would like to see happen is at:

<a href="http://www.extropy.com/~exi/exponent/1999/031999.htm">http://www.extropy.com/~exi/exponent/1999/031999.htm</a>

<p>
<a name="4191qlink1">I share Harvey's frustration at lack of progress. I won't rehash the
various reasons for this. I will just note two things:</a> All the time I have
to Exi right now is devoted to a major,  tanglble project -- Extro 4: The
Biotech Futures Conference. I'm disappointed to hear little comment on
this. If we can secure funding from foundations, I would to follow up on
the event with a book, or web-published proceedings, or set of policy
and/or educational papers  But more on that another time.

<p>
As always, I continue to welcome suggestions for changing the status quo.
Please work with us, not against us.

<p>
Onward!
