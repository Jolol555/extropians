<p>
Perhaps. But this technology is far beyond nanotech, and modifying the
strong force may not even be possible; we at least know atoms can be
moved around, but we have no idea how to change the forces in the
nucleus (except banging things into it at a high speed).

<p>
Yes. Most likely a nanotech construction site would look like a pool
of stuff from which the building would grow, with trucks pouring in
stuff like iron oxide, sugar (for energy) and sand.

<p>
<a href="0492.html#0494qlink3">&gt; Silicon possesses very similar qualities to carbon in terms of electron</a><br>

<p>
Isn't the Si-Si bond weaker than the C-C bond? The silicon fullerenes
doesn't have to be stable. I can't recall if silicon even can form
something like graphite sheets.
