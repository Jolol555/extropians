Absolutely. And a waste of resources - we've spent a lot of money
getting the stuff up there we might as well try and use it, rather than
let it float around endangering shipping. 
Any ideas?

Many, just not necessarily practical ones. The problem is
that everything is in different orbits. No one has figured out
how to use a chunk of debris that flies past every once in
a long while at several thousand meters per second. I had

Catching them is the problem. If we could do that then it would be worth
just dumping them in the trojan points until someone can come up with a
use for it all.
