Note to the clueless: pro-gunners say we need guns to *prevent* crimes by
stopping criminals when they try to commit those crimes. Anti-gunners prefer
to punish the criminals *after* the crime is committed, if they get caught;
if the victim was killed, raped, etc, well, tough luck.</a>

<p>
No, we'd rather prevent such shootings by having people with guns there to
shoot anyone who tries it. As has happened on at least one occasion in
America and several occasions in Israel, but the anti-gunners don't like 
</a>to mention that.

Joe, these kids had bombs. Big fucking bombs. Bombs reportedly big enough
to blow up half the school if they'd been set off. Had they had no guns,
then they would have set those bombs off, and far more kids would have
died.</a>

<p>
<a name="2142qlink4">Bombs, incidentally, have been illegal for quite a while, as far as I'm
aware. So much for laws, eh?
