<a name="0157qlink1">Perhaps we should consider some sort of hybrid.  Consider a government
with only two functions: national defense and meta-contract enforcement.
Interactions between individuals and most firms would be handled by 
private protection agencies (PPAs).  The government would concern itself 
with PPA-turns-into-hostile-army scenarios, and with choice of law 
enforced via a single transferable asset ("money").</a>

<p>
Your PPA bothering you?  Did you clearly contract with them and specify
an arbitrator?  If so, the only possible government law issue is whether 
the arbitrator's judgement was carried out.  If the arbitrator says 
it wasn't, a monetary fine or transfer might be imposed on the PPA.   
Is it not clear which PPA you contracted with?  The government isn't 
going to allow much subtly here.  Did you sign that contract?  OK, good 
enough for us.

<p>
Does some PPA seems to have turned into an army threatening national
security?  Well that's something the government must be concerned with.
What, you say its just sour grapes from your competitors?  This gets
tricker to judge.  But if the complaining locals at the border of 
the "territory" where you are the main PPA all seem free to leave with
most assets, the case against you will seem weaker.  And strong "lockin"
by customers might make the case against you stronger.  It would be 
"anti-trust" law at the PPA level, ensuring competition at perhaps some
expense in economies of scale.  

<p>
Oh, and the government would also have to impose some taxes to pay for
that national defense and ability to impose judgements on PPAs.  Here
I'd prefer a very simple stable tax rule, perhaps a property tax.
