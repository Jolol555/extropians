Thanks Ross!  I was hoping someone would point this out. {8^D

Or are at fault for not disabling MS Word macros.  Mostly I see
Microsloth is at fault for not lifting<a name="0246qlink1"> a corporate finger to secure
word macros against just such a thing.  As Peter McCluskey
pointed out, the concept virus was known, a loooong time
ago, yet, as far as I know, Microsloth is stillll shipping Word
with macros enabled, a feature which will be used by few,
but is a dangerously efficient superhighway for creating and
spreading malicious code.</a>

Difficult?  Its impossible.  The software company should assume at
least a modicum of responsibility.  It would be easy to write a
safeguard that will disallow a word macro from invading the
user's address book, creating a jillion copies of itself,  and scattering
them like the leaves of autumn.  Im not a software type, but
am I alone here?  Is not Microsoft at least partially to blame for
the melissa fiasco?  spike
