<p>
No, everyone should be able to protect themselves to an extent, and that
extent needs to be agreed upon and decided.  I don't think lethal
technology is a good idea.  You do. I fail to see how your opinion makes
things suddenly objectively true, unless you are god or some other
higher power.

<p>
On the contrary, until people are mature enough to leave each other
alone, I think abdicating the responsibility to a group who are trained
and professional is a great idea.  I like the fact that the police carry
the guns and the people don't.  The only real reason I can see for
arming the populace is to keep the government in line, and the days when
the people can overthrow the govt by force of arms is long gone in most
developed countries.

<p>
I have a solution. Ban guns. Quite simple, really.

<p>
If the dike is leaking, only a fool would continue to live under it.
