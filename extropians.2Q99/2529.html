<a name="2616qlink1">The main reason there are objections to this debate is that most of the objectors have
never taken the time to research extropianism in depth before they subscribed to the
list, and many never ever read the FAQ. The rest of the objectors here are the types
who usually play devil's advocate against extropian ideas, especially if they don't
fit in with their statist mindset.

<p>
Then I suggest you read the FAQ and other info at the extropy.com site.

<a href="2519.html#2529qlink3">&gt; Besides: libertarianism is a *current* political philosophy, and I would</a><br>
<i>&gt; argue there are better fora for discussion of current events.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; BTW: Guns are, in fact, technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2616qlink2"><i>&gt; But the Gun Debate is, in fact, politics.</i><br>

<p>
It is the politics of allowing powerful technology be used by common people with
little or no government control. I cannot think of a more usefull paralell to the
problems we will face in the future when human level IQ desktop PCs and
nanotechnologies will be commonly available and affordable. If we cannot resolve this
debate now on the mundane technologies like guns, then there is no hope of a minimally
<a name="2616qlink3">chaotic future with those other technologies. Too often people want to just stick
</a>
their heads in the sand because they don't want to do the hard work of thinking for
<a name="2616qlink4">themselves and acting for themselves. This is the root cause of further government
</a>
encroachment into people's lives, enslaving them more and more, and is also why some
people don't want to deal with this debate.

<p>
<a name="2616qlink5"><a href="2519.html#2529qlink4">&gt; &gt; Not politically correct technology, but</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology nontheless.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Those that tolerate supression of such a mundane</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology like guns cannot cry and whine when the really usefull technologies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; get banned by the same tyrants.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course they bloody well can.</i><br>

<p>
Not if they are to retain any integrity. If they enjoy being hypocrits, ok.

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thank you for making everyone's point once again.</i><br>

<p>
Thanks for demonstrating once again that your side isn't interested in debating to
learn but to avoid debate in order to avoid the truths that you deny about yourselves.
