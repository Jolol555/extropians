<a href="0025.html#0033qlink2">&gt; Another example we may consider: Suppose we have a computer running </a><br>

<i>&gt; In some sense, we then have what looks like the same structure </i><br>

<i>&gt; difference seems to be that in the case of the process, the various </i><br>
<i>&gt; states are causally connected, whereas with the spatial pattern that </i><br>
<i>&gt; is not so.</i><br>

<p>
I don't think we can really be sure that the latter doesn't give rise to
consciousness. I actually believe that even one RAM chip in isolation (ie
not necessarily in a spatial pattern with the other RAM chips) can give
rise to a conscious experience, that the internal spatial pattern of the
bits in the RAM chip is sufficient.
