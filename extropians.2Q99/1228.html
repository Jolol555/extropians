<p>
Damascus steel  treatment processes were liberated long ago and have been common knowledge among blacksmiths for hundreds of years. Its also known as watered steel because of the rippled color you see from the hundreds of layers of alternating carbon densities. Gun barrels were made by a hammer forging process itilizing layered and wound case hardened wire that is an offshoot of the damascus method, and such barrels were called 'Damascus' barrels by the smiths who made them. Such barrels went out of favor with the advent of  drilled and forged solid steel and nitro powders early in this century, as damascus barrels that were not proof fired at the factory for nitro powders had a risk of bursting when fired with these more powerful gun powders, rather than the black powder they were designed for. However, once you take a damascus barrel gun, do an inductance test on it and proof fire it with a 200% charge, it is proven usable for modern charges. The barrels that would burst were ones t
hat had internal structural flaws that could not be seen with the old methods of quality control.
