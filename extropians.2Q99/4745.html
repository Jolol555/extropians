<p>
<a href="4711.html#4745qlink3">&gt;For those of you who can't click on the link directly from your</a><br>

            My .25 opinion is my own.


<p>
Read it, typical marketing fluff piece, it is a hybrid system,
fiber to the curb then VDSL probably on CAT 5 or better. And its
only a test, just 200 homes....

<p>
I liked the possibility of 36mbs (though they didn't claim they
were running that) although a T-3 is 45mbs, and they pegged the
consumer cost at $520 not counting the CO equipment and thats going
to be a bitch, say a router $20,000 and $5000 a port for a max of
12 ports. now you've got to have a backbone faster that that (OC-
12) very big bucks, and thats just for 12 ports......

<p>
We had planned to bring fiber to the door about 8 years ago, then
the consummer groups, the long distance companies, the cable
companies, the FCC and everybody else and their mothers jumped in.

<p>
When they were done it wasn't worth building, they still whine and
want to know why we haven't built it.... &lt;SHEESH&gt;
