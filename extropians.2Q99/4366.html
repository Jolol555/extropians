<a name="4424qlink1"><a name="4394qlink1">I highly recomment Douglas Hofstadter's "Godel, Escher, Back: An Eternal
Golden Braid" for its treatment of this topic.  His theory (in very
simplified form) is that consciousness is a natural result of the inherent
complexity of a sentient mind.  To make a system that can act in an
</a>
intelligent fashion you have to build in all sorts of low-level
self-reference, in the form of programs that modift other programs within
the mind.  Once the whole system reaches a certain level of complexity (a
"critical mass" for sentience) these self-referential systems become
sufficiently tangled (and therefore sufficiently complete) to support
consciousness.  Thus, making a human-level intelligence that is not
conscious would be an exceedingly difficult project, and it may turn out to
be impossible in principle.

<p>
Of course, all of this is still untestable, but he makes a much better
argument than most people in this field ever manage.
