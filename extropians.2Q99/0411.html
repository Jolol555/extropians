The problem is that you would need to have your trailer panelled with
<a name="0414qlink1">solar cells to be of any use at all. You'll generate less than .2 kW per
square meter of trailer roof and/or side surface, if you are lucky, even
with the best commercial panels. A trailer is what? 35 or 40 feet long?</a>
8 feet wide? 10 feet high side walls? Do you use your own trailer or do
you haul other people's trailers?

<p>
That gives you about 30 square meters on the roof and 40 on each side.
You'll never generate more than 7 or 8 kW with roof and sides panelled
in solar panels in constant output between 9 am and 4 pm on sunny days. 
Thats barely enough power to run a geo metro electric car, you'd
<a name="0413qlink1">probably expend that much energy hauling the weight of the solar panels
around. Converting to hydrogen/oxygen fuel and back in an IC engine will
reduce your final output to less than 3 kW at best. I would say it would
be better to depend on service station generated hydrogen if you want to
go that route, or go with an electric semi.</a> 

<p>
The fuel cell busses in LA work because they all depend on a handful of
hydrogen fuel stations in the LA area. You couldn't do that on a
nationwide trucking basis unless you got a chain of truckstop franchises
to make the investment in hydrogen facilities. Fat chance.
