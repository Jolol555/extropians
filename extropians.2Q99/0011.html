<a name="0028qlink1">it appears as if joe dees wrote (I think - the formatting on this post is
badly scrambled):
<br>
<a href="0010.html#0011qlink1">&gt; Automatic weapons</a><br>
<i>&gt; did not exist when the framers wrote the Constitution, nor</i><br>
<i>&gt; did rockets or nukes.  May I be so bold as to suggest that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; had they, the Constitution itself would have pried them from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fingers of the general populace?</i><br>

<p>
Actually, the Constitution explicitly presumes that private citizens will
own naval warships (see: Letters of Marquee and Reprisal), which were the
most expensive and specialized weapons of the day.  As I understand it,
their main reason for favoring private weapon ownership was as a defense
against tyrannical government, which obviously requires private access to
just about anything.

is really a significant barrier to oppression, but that's a different
argument.</a></a></a>
