Dna-based Chips Diagnose Disease-- And Raise Hackles 
The Sacramento Bee

<p>
It looks like a run-of-the-mill silicon computer chip. It's flat, 
dark gray and no bigger than a thumbnail. But this is a very special 
chip: Its job is to find out whether people are likely to get cancer. 

<p>
Similar chips are being made for other diseases, including AIDS, 
leukemia and tuberculosis, and eventually there will be chips that 
will even predict the behavioral traits of unborn babies. 

<p>
DNA chip technology is a burgeoning new area of medicine and genetics 
that promises to revolutionize disease diagnosis. But it is also 
generating growing controversy, with calls for international controls 
to make sure it is not abused. 

<p>
Current laboratory techniques for detecting genetic mutations that 
are responsible for disease are time-consuming and expensive, taking 
months, even years. In contrast, a DNA chip takes minutes, or at most 
hours, to seek out disease-causing mutations in genes. 

<p>
Though the technology is complex, the theory behind the process is 
simple. Instead of having intricate microelectronic circuits etched 
onto their surfaces, these tiny chips are coated with DNA sequences, 
some of which are associated with a healthy gene while others are 
known disease-causing mutations. 

<p>
The sequences, up to 400,000 on a single tiny chip, line up in the 
squares of a grid on the surface of the chip. A sample of the 
patient's DNA is then put onto the chip and each sequence pairs off 
with its opposite number. Whether or not they are exactly the same as 
their partner is then detected by a laser. 

<p>
A patient whose DNA exactly matches with a known mutation on the chip 
may be at risk from that particular disease. If the DNA fails to 
match with a known healthy sequence, that can also indicate potential 
problems. 

<p>
"It is incredibly rapid. What you are relying on is that you will <br>
recognize differences between the DNA on the chip and DNA you are 
looking at. In terms of a quick screen, it is masterful because it 
gives you a quick answer and it is cheap," says Dr. Gareth Evans, 
consultant geneticist at Christie's Hospital in Manchester, England. 

<p>
Half a dozen companies are now working on producing variations of 
these chips and California-based Affymetrix has launched three for 
use by researchers. The jewel in the crown at present is a chip that 
works on a gene called p53 that is abnormal in more than half of all 
types of cancers. 

<p>
At the Houston Advanced Researcher Center, Dr. Dat Dao and a team of 
researchers are working on chips that will be able to pinpoint 
antibiotic-resistant strains of TB. Another chip detecting mutations 
linked to breast cancer is in the pipeline, and the center is also 
working on one that will take some of the uncertainty out of matching 
donor tissue for bone marrow transplants. 

<p>
"This genosensor technology is going to create a host of benefits for <br>
the diagnosis of cancer as well as genetic and infectious diseases. 
It is going to be the diagnostic tool of the future," says Dao. 

<p>
Dr. Mike Ramsay of the Oak Ridge National laboratory in Tennessee, 
who also works with DNA chips, agrees: "This technology could be used 
to screen for people carrying genes that predispose them to getting 
breast cancer, becoming obese, or having children with cystic 
fibrosis. To make such an analysis we eventually hope to require only 
a few white blood cells or skin cells." 

<p>
But the rapidly evolving technology is seen by some as a Pandora's 
box, with almost as many ethical dilemmas as benefits. One of the 
biggest fears is that the chips will be seen as the ideal tool for 
the establishment of widespread genetic screening of all types and 
for all kinds of motives. 

<p>
"Today's supply of screening for young couples is restricted to <br>
cystic fibrosis and a few rare diseases that are confined to specific 
populations. The chip, however, will broaden the spectrum of 
analyzable parental traits practically ad libitum," says Dr. Wolfram 
Henn, a clinical geneticist at the University of Hamburg in Germany 
who raised concerns about the technology in this month's Journal of 
Medical Ethics. 

<p>
The chief area for concern is prenatal screening, where DNA chips, 
the developers claim, will make it possible to test for every disease 
and trait in an unborn baby. 

<p>
"The subjective choice of genetic traits that are considered as <br>
prenatal selection criteria may blur the distinction between 
preventative medicine and striving for the perfectly designed child," 
he says.
