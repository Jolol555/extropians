         Here is a favorite PBN paper from the National Institute on Aging.   
Note that it is effective from drinking water.    BTW,  24 months is fairly 
elderly for a mouse.

 To characterize the pharmacological effects of N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenyl
nitrone (PBN) on life span, we administered PBN in drinking water to 24.5
-month-old mice, and the survivors were counted. Their water consumption 
and body weights were measured as biological markers. PBN-treated animals
 as compared with control animals had prolonged mean and maximum life spans. 
Their water consumption decreased but no significant change was found in their 
body weights, indicating that the metabolism was improved. Results showed that 
PBN indeed affects physiological functions and extends life span. We propose 
that nitric oxide release from PBN may be involved in altering the aging 
process.
