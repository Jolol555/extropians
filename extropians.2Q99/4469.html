I think it would be keen to look into the future of entertainment.

<p>
I mean, you've got all these people getting rich off the net,
and it is only going to be getting better in the future. So
what are these people going to be doing with their time now
that they are liberated from their day-to-day jobs?

<p>
What kinds of new arts and hobbies might spring up to fill
that need to be doing something? Will more and more people
use the newly available huge amounts of cheap computing
power and storage to make their own movies? Is the technology
available to allow one or two people to get together and
make a full length high-quality film within a reasonable
amount of time? Are they going to broadcast their efforts
over the constantly-getting-faster net? Sports- there will
be many many new sports created as technology enables
people to do wilder things. I'm sure you can come up with
many ideas, I've gotta sleep.

<p>
Oh and don't forget about travel. You've got to have at least
a blurb about space tourism.
