From: Chuck Kuecker &lt;ckuecker@mcs.net&gt;

<p>
<a href="4040.html#4101qlink1">&gt;&gt;It seems to me that if this can be substantiated, it would be a</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;very cheap tool for reducing the long-term crime rate (by</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;enabling ex-&gt;prisoners to re-integrate with society more easily).</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I'm a bit more pessimistic, however, about the idea of teaching</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;useful vocational skills in a prison environment; we're moving</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;out of the industrial mass-production era, and unskilled or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;semi-skilled labour just isn't in that much demand. Teaching a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;con how to work a drill press or lathe isn't really going to help</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;them get a job as a waiter or a taxi driver ...</i><br>


<p>
<a href="4040.html#4101qlink2">&gt;There is still demand for manual skills such as construction</a><br>
<i>&gt;workers - if we could get the unions to allow it...</i><br>

<p>
Get us to allow it? Many Unions including my own have programs in
various prisons already. We of course limit/select the number of 
participants. Economics 101.


<p>
<a href="4040.html#4101qlink3">&gt;Perhaps courses in courtesy and how to live in a polite society</a><br>
<i>&gt;would be of use. Teaching the inmates how to speak clear standard</i><br>
<i>&gt;English would also help them gain entrance to many low level jobs.</i><br>

<p>
High School diploma minimum.

<p>
<a href="4040.html#4101qlink4">&gt;I have a vision of the prisons becoming such effective training</a><br>
<i>&gt;facilities that released criminals would be in higher demand than</i><br>
<i>&gt;unskilled non-ex-cons, promoting a wave of petty 'crime' for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;express purpose of gaining an education..</i><br>

<p>
Not a bad vision...
