<p>
I'll agree here, but not for the reasons stated.

<p>
<i>&gt; H2 as fuel should in</i><br>
<a href="0430.html#0445qlink2">&gt;principle be no more difficult to handle than propane, if it comes from</a><br>
<i>&gt;the factory already compressed in a tank.  But nobody uses H2, so there</i><br>
<i>&gt;are no H2 stoves, refrigerators, or heaters.  A gas appliance expert</i><br>
<i>&gt;could possibly modify existing propane appliances to burn H2.  I think H2</i><br>

<p>
actually,  in the 70's extensive tests were conducted on hydrogen fuels.
The summary of work done by the brookhaven national lab as i recall was
that standard methane/propane infrastructure worked quite well for
hydrogen.  Burners required new ports and leak rates were higher,  but the
total
<br>
energy loss was no more then existing hydrocarbons.

<p>
<a href="0430.html#0445qlink3">&gt;would burn with an invisible flame.  And unlike propane, H2 is lighter</a><br>
<i>&gt;than air so would not tend to pool in low spots like propane might in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;event of a leak.</i><br>

<p>
this is generally a plus, who needs to see the flame?

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0430.html#0445qlink4">&gt;But to store H2 made on site, one would need a compressor and storage</a><br>
<i>&gt;tank, which costs money and poses safety problems.  Another practical</i><br>

<p>
not necessarily.  one can store hydrogen as hydrates, using a process
similiar to

<p>
acetylene storage.

<p>
<a href="0430.html#0445qlink5">&gt;problem is the amount of energy available per day from solar power.  If</a><br>
<i>&gt;the entire roof of, say, 10 square meters were covered horizontally with</i><br>
<i>&gt;10% efficient solar electric panels, the KWH would average about 1 to 3</i><br>
<i>&gt;per day, assuming typical cloud cover, angle of incidence, and daylight</i><br>
<i>&gt;hours for 40 degrees latitude.  That is about 8 to 25 cents per day worth</i><br>
<i>&gt;of electricity based on what land based residential consumers of</i><br>
<i>&gt;electricity typically pay.  That could be increased by angling the panels</i><br>
<i>&gt;towards the sun or adding pop up vertical mirrors on the sides.  It's</i><br>
<i>&gt;cheaper to buy electricity or propane than it is to make energy oneself</i><br>
<i>&gt;from solar panels, for most applications, when you consider the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the panels and the ancillary equipment.</i><br>

<p>
or one needs to use a different process,  say photo-catalysis.
rhodium exposed to UV catylzes water.  it's expensive,  but works.
however as ron says it's not real practical.

<p>
and if you are going to invest in solar infrastructure just do solar hot water
and have a solar refrigerator.  far more effective.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0430.html#0445qlink6">&gt;&gt;Could such a unit be built inexpensively enough such that it would </a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;make sense </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to purchase it as opposed to the propane which he currently uses...(a </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;little </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;over a dollar a gallon....dual  seven gallon tanks being good for not </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;quiet a </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;month....)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It would definitely not be cost-effective to build just one.  Mass</i><br>
<i>&gt;produced, they could be much cheaper, but still not cheap enough that</i><br>
<i>&gt;people would want buy them as opposed to just buying propane tanks.</i><br>

<p>
if you want your own methane for Y2K,  why not build a methane reactor.
take your human wastes, run it into a water tank,  and let bacteria
produce this,  or stick a tube int he rear end of a cow,  and harvest methane
this way.  every day you milk the cow and vent the gas.  the cow is pretty
uncomfortable,
<br>
but they don't kick much.


<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0430.html#0445qlink7">&gt;&gt;Hmmmmm....now if THAT is possible...what about a Hydrogen fueled..fuel </a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;cell </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;powered semi?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;If H2 were a commercially available fuel, it would possibly be practical</i><br>
<i>&gt;to run tractor trailer rigs from it, while noting the inconvenience of</i><br>
<i>&gt;wrestling H2 tanks in and out of their cradles when refueling, and noting</i><br>
<i>&gt;the danger of driving around with H2 tanks.  Compressed gas tanks are</i><br>
<i>&gt;banned from tunnels, for instance.</i><br>

<p>
which is why they use LNG on buses ;-)

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0430.html#0445qlink8">&gt;But for now, gasoline and diesel are cheaper fuels than H2 (per BTU), and</a><br>
<i>&gt;are widely available and convenient to handle.  If fossil fuels had never</i><br>
<i>&gt;been commercialized, it is likely that cars and trucks, if we had them,</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be running on ethanol, methane, or H2, made from renewable sources.</i><br>

<p>
well i do have to agree with rons summary even if his reasoning isn't perfect.
