&gt; Purports to allow for safe posting of copyrighted images, plus
&gt; a purchase option. Requires user to download an ActiveX or

&gt;From an article linked from their web site:

<p>
<i>: The first application based on that technology, PixSafe, due out this</i><br>

<i>: picture will find the "save as..."  function in their browsers disabled</i><br>

<p>
This is an example of what Kelsey and Schneier were warning against
in that article I referenced.  It's very difficult to make schemes
like this secure.  What if you're running Windows in an emulator box,
like VirtualPC on the Mac?  The encapsulated OS doesn't know that its
display is under the control of another OS which can capture graphics
or do whatever else it likes.  In general, if you are displaying images
or sounds to the user, there will usually be a way to make copies.
