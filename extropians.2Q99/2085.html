<a name="2106qlink1">Has anyone here thought out this meme: perhaps the *most* important
influences in our lives are not family and friends, but the books we
read as children?  These plant memes early, when they have the
most impact on our developing synaptic interconnections.</a>

<p>
Extropians started down this road at least once before I think, then
were distracted by whizzing bullets.

Someone argued that if the question is interpreted as which
book had the most *impact*, it might well be a Dr. Seuss
work, or equivalent.  This notion might explain a few things at least
in my case.  {8^D  spike
