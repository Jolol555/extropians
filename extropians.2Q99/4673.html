Mike, Lckheed Mrtin would probably be a poor bet, as this is the *first*
time in my 15 yrs in the rocket science business that I have *ever* gone
on a trip where the women outnumbered the men.  (In this case it was
three ladies and I was one of two men).  It was so unusual, I asked
some coworkers today and *none* of them had ever been on an
estrogen dominated business trip with this company.

<p>
And I....  sat in my room, reading a book.  {8-[  sigh...  {8^D

<p>
by the way, Im happily married, so I had really nothing to gain.  spike
