<p>
(Mild spoilers for Neal Stephenson's "Cryptonomicon.  Delete this if
you're fanatical about spoilers and intend to read the book.)

<p>
Neal Stephenson's newly released best-seller "Cryptonomicon" contains
<a name="3715qlink1">references to a group that appears to be at least loosely based on the
extropians and transhumanists.</a>

<p>
Without spoiling the book much, here's an excerpt from p252:

<p>
"But the basic premise of Eutropianism is that technology has made us
post-human.  That Homo Sapiens plus technology is effectively a whole new
species: immortal, omnipresent because of the Net, and headed towards
omnipotence.  Now, the first people to talk that way were libertarians."

<p>
<a name="3715qlink2">I'm about a third of the way through the book at present.  It's showing
considerable promise as a novel, less as a hard science fiction story ---
not many new ideas, but an interesting human side.</a>
