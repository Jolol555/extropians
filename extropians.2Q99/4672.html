For most of your life, you have conditioned yourself to "see" women in this
way.
<br>
It's possible to get out of it. Unfortunately, it takes just as much either
time or cumulative effort as it took to get you into this situation. It's
not as simple as flipping a switch, but it is simple.
Hard work.

<a href="4668.html#4672qlink1">&gt;I didn't say I didn't enjoy sex. I said I didn't like being dominated by my</a><br>
<i>&gt;hormones. I'm a happily married man (18 years). If I could flip a switch and</i><br>
<i>&gt;not have to evaluate every female I see as "doable" or not--even though I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have no intention whatsoever of actually "doing" her--I'd be happier than I</i><br>
<i>&gt;am now. If I could see a pretty woman and not stare at her, that'd be great.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If I could concentrate on the task at hand in the presence of women, rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;than fantasize about them, I'd be happier.</i><br>
