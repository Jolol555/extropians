If anyone wants business ideas, I can give them away for free.  It's not
like I have a limited supply or anything.  As far as I can tell from
examination of the information industry, an idea is basically worth
nothing.  The more people realize this, the more will be willing to give
away their ideas.

<p>
For example, I'd like to see an Internet gambling organization that ran
a zero-sum game (no house odds) and made its money selling advertising. 
Why?  To break the government lotteries at ludicrous odds targeting the
poor and destitute.  What is this idea worth?  Not much, because I
believe the government doesn't want anyone else offering better odds to
the poor.  But even if it was legal (anyone live in a country where it
is?), I'd still give the idea away.  Like the other 500 great ideas I
keep in a little box somewhere, it needs doing and it's more likely to
get done if I don't keep it a secret.  (If anyone starts an Internet
company around this, just send me 0.1% of the stock, if you feel like it.)
