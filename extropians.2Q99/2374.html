Dear Dr. Kent,

<p>
I apear to have been invited into this discussion by Matthew Gaylor.  If you're
not familiar with my books and other writings on  firearms-related issues,
you're
<br>
probably not going to accept that I know more about this subject than you
do. But
<br>
I do and you should.

<p>
The criminological research proving that guns are much more frequent in
stopping
<br>
criminal invasions and tragic consequences than in enabling such is so
indisputable to anyone who isn't dishonest or operating on a hidden agenda
as to
<br>
make your opening assertions a billboard that you haven't done your homework.

<p>
I've given up debating this issue; it's too wearing. I write books then
move on to
<br>
other topics so I don't have to endlessly rehash the same subjects.

<p>
If you actually give a damn about the truth about guns, I recommend that you
consult my book Stopping Power: Why 70 Million Americans Own Guns. You can
buy the
<br>
new paperback edition on Amazon.com. There's a reading list at the end of
my book,
<br>
in case my book leaves you unsatisfied.

<p>
Otherwise, understand that by making unsupported assertions about a subject you
haven't spent any time researching will only discredit your scholarly
abilities in
<br>
the minds of anyone who has.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
J. Neil Schulman.
