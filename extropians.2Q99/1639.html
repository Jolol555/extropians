<a href="1627.html#1639qlink1">"The simplest case would be something like increasing your range of</a><br>
hearing.  To do that you essentially have to remove all of the brain
mechanisms that handle sound processing, and replace them with an
upgraded version that can handle a
<br>
wider range of frequencies and a larger volume of data.  That's a big
job, but at least its confined to a single system."

<p>
To increase your range of hearing, you could easily shift higher
frequencies down into the audible range with a computerized hearing aid.</a> 
The sounds could be slowed down, if desired, or listened to in slices,
with enough slices missing to that the sound is in the audible range but
also at its original speed.  One could even broadcast messages in the
higher frequencies of sound that others could hear, with the right
<br>
"hearing aids".<br>

<p>
<a name="1656qlink2">With vision, the frequencies outside visual range could be shifted
however one wanted and overlaid on the visual range frequencies, or a
huge chunk of the EM spectrum could be compressed to fit in the visual
range. Or any number of other options.  As long as you have the equipment
to detect the frequencies and to display visual information (and some
kind of computing device), you can do this (the programming would be
rather simple, I think).</a>

<p>
<a name="1656qlink3">Although (as I have pointed out before) to take full advantage of any
sensory enhancements, one must learn to process more sensory information
per second.  I have demonstrated (to myself, anyway) that one can do this
deliberately by learning to focus more intently on the present sensory
experience.  Many others throughout history have confirmed this for
themselves also.  In fact, many martial arts disciplines spend a great
deal of time on enhancing one's senses.</a>
