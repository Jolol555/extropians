Actually there are some serious inbred heritable diseases in both populations.

<p>
Tay-Sachs Syndrome is rather widespread, too much for institutionalization. As for
the sort of rebelliousness that normally winds you up in prison, I'm sure that
hundreds of years of repression will tend to breed that out, though it seems like the
rest, if they weren't killed in the Ghetto rebellion, are now doing quite fine in
Isreal. As John Stewart, the jewish comedian recently said,"the Jews in Isreal are
different from Jews here. The Jews here are your pacifist liberal democrat Jews,
while the Jews in Isreal are the paranoid militant assault rifle toting Jews."

<a href="3087.html#3099qlink3">&gt; But here we have the myth that there is no such thing as a defective person, just</a><br>
<i>&gt; under funded schools.   And instead of putting violent people into prison, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; have social reformers who want to make the whole country a prison.</i><br>

<p>
I often wonder which came first: cathode ray tubes used for entertainment, or the
trend of increasing numbers of short sighted, astygmatic, near blind people.... (me
being one of those astygmatics...)
