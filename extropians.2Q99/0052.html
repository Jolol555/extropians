I'm optimistic, dammit! Perhaps my shiny-happy view of the world has just
gone to far this time. However, I didn't focus on anything _anti_ in "The
Matrix." Without giving too much away, I saw it as a Hero learning,
thinking, and finding a drive to conquer. This to me is what greatness is
all about. I could have I suppose looked at it from a negative point of
view, but I so was engulfed in the integration of the special effects used
perfectly, strong hero, and great f***ing clothes. I actively sifted out
whatever pessimistic viewpoint might have been included. 

<p>
I want to see the good. I want to see technology. I want to see heros and
heroines and that is just what I did. Amazing what the mind takes in, when
it is focused with a particular slant. I have seen "The Matrix" twice now,
and each time I came out inspired and thrilled about what is ahead.
