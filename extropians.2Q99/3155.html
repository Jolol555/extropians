that is stress. Apparently it is quite healthy to get angry every now and
then, because lowers your stress levels.</a></a>

<a name="3163qlink3">I've been trying to work out how to do this in some kind of useful manner. I
don't normally get angry, but I know that the stress builds because of this.
The problem is that I find the expression of anger distasteful, which many
here might identify</a> with.

<a name="3163qlink4">Maybe I've got to play sport. Exercise is supposed to be wonderful for
stress, I guess I've got to find time. But when you're faced with decisions
like "Either I read another chapter of Hofstader, or I go and play indoor
soccer" - well, what would you do?</a>

for as long as I like without impacting on the rest of my life.</a> My wife
might be surprised at how quickly I am aging, but maybe with life extension
I can compensate. Then time on the exercise bike might not seem like such a
waste.
