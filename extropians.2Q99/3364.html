<p>
In the last 8 days, the ExI list has lost about 5% of its membership.  On
5/31/99, the list had 363 subscribers.  Today that number is down to 346.
For those who hope that maybe these losses were simply transfers from the
list to the digest, the digest membership has only increased by 3 during
that period of time.

<p>
Let us continue to receive 200+ posts a day, 80% of which are noise or
unrelated posts about guns, taxes, abortion, navel lint, and any other topic
which generates discussion quality only found in bars and pubs.

<a name="3462qlink1"><a name="3436qlink1">In all this mania of late, I am wondering where the list owners are?  Where
are Max and other ExI representatives to assist in enforcing the list
guidelines?</a>  I realize everyone is busy but this list is going downhill
fast.</a>
