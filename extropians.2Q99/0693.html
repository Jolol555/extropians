<p>
Lasers have recoil, just like anything else - it is very small, because the
beam has very little mass, but it is measurable.</a>

<p>
Yes, it does.  These two forces are exactly equal, so your idea:

<p>
unfortunately won't work.  You can use a stationary laser to push a moving
object, but you can't use the laser/mirror pair to move itself.  Darn,
another great idea shot down by those nasty conservation laws!

<p>

<i>&gt; coherent light flying at the speed of light away from the engine.</i><br>

<p>
As an interesting note, you CAN get thrust by simply firing the laser out
the back of your spaceship.  Unfortunately, we currently can't build lasers
that move enough energy to make this practical - the thrust would be far too
low for even the most modest of needs.</a>

<p>
Now, if we could make very powerful, compact, lightweight lasers, and power
them with a nuclear energy source, we would have a very efficient means of
propulsion (and this is not a new idea, so neither of us can lay claim to
it).
