I think the importance of politics in a world of individua of all 
complexity, expanding outwards hard on the heels of the light cone 
will be less important than today. Both because they are not
monodisperse, and because of communication lag. Perhaps ecology 
and evolutionary biology will be more applicable.

I don't have a definite position towards guns. It's just that guns are 
relatively low-tech (is there legislation against possession of ABC
weapons by individuals?), yet never fail to provoke heated debates which 
never came to any consensus. Being fruitless, they'd be better kept
off-list.

Will there be politics after the Singularity?
