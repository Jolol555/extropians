<a name="0024qlink1">If computational uncertainty is covered under probability theory, maybe it
can shed some light on the Self-Indication Axiom (SIA). Suppose you are in
a universe with either 1 or 10 people, depending on whether the 100!-th
digit of PI is odd or even. (There is a machine that computes the digit
and then creates either 1 or 10 people.) Should you believe that the
100!-th digit of PI is more likely to be even than odd? This is similar to
the thought experiment in your DA paper where a machine creates 1 or 10
people depending on the outcome of a coin flip, but without the problem of
dealing with what it means for the coin flip to be "fair".
