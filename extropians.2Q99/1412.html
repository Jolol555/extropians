When I saw the desire was to be "philosophical" (off the
record was my major at University of Denver) I was ready to
say the same thing as Doug, but seriously, I spoke with one
of the students here from California and she indicated that
Davis would be a "nice" place, UCLA might have a good
Philosopy Dept, but the atmosphere will be "large city."
Her recommendation was to check out Santa Cruz, about 1 hour
South of San Francisco.  She said that some of her friends
were Philosophy Majors and they were there.

Just more information to sort through...
