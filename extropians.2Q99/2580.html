<a href="2570.html#2580qlink1">&gt; Though most doctors now take CFS more seriously than in the past</a><br>
<i>&gt; (even CDC now recognizes it as a valid diagnosis), there is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; any evidence or consensus for a link to fat in the diet.  It is</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably a bad idea to spread that rumor, as it may encourage</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone to increase their fat intake and risk heart disease.</i><br>

<p>
In view of the fact that it has been known for decades, that a zero fat diet
kills animals faster than no food at all. I think it is irresponsible for
media/medical experts to encourage people to think fat is some kind of poison.

<p>
And while the Standard American Diet, is too high in fat. I think that the
people on this list are very health conscious.  And I think it is very likely,
that I am not the only one who has taken low fat eating to an unhealthy
extreme.

<p>
And I think people should try things out and find out for themselves, what is
and isn't healthy, instead of blindly trusting the medical establishment. My
Dad was skeptical about my change in diet, and he insisted that I have a check
up before he went on it.  So I did. My BP was 120 and my cholesterol was 161,
and the doctor said that I was the healthiest person he has seen all month.

<p>
So my dad finally tried it.  He is now eating eggs and bacon every morning,
and his cholesterol has for the first time dropped below 200.  So much for it
being a danger to the heart!!!
