How is this different from saying, "Forget photons and light spectra -
rainbows exist, so let's get on with it!"?  Asking "Why does anything
exist at all?" is a fully legitimate question of physics.  I believe
that there will never be a Theory of Everything, a theory that can
predict the behavior of any natural phenomenon, which does not also
answer this question.  Just as there will never be a complete theory of
the mind (one which can predict my behavior in all circumstances) which
does not also fully explain the apparent subjectivity, irreducibility,
undoubtability, and unity of qualia.  After all, I wrote that sentence,
didn't I?

<p>
You are quite right in that what I have called "the hard problem of
existence" is the closest analogy to the hard problem of consciousness.

<a name="4486qlink1">Actually, I've always maintained that scientists refusing to believe in
naked singularities or closed timelike lines is a case of simple
chauvinism.  "We don't want to believe in paradoxes because, er, they're
so ugly."  It is absolutely no different, in form or content, from
people refusing to believe that the Earth is not the center of the
Universe.  They cite no justifications from experiment or physical law. 
They don't want to believe in it, so it can't exist.

<a name="4495qlink1">I happen to believe that time travel is explicitly permitted by General
Relativity, which forbids a single correct direction of time just as
Special Relativity forbids an "ether" or single correct reference frame.</a></a>

<p>
So, yes, again you're quite right - at least I'm consistent.
