<i>&gt; &gt; On the physics side I'm starting with Feynman's lecture </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; series. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A good idea. A very good series.</i><br>

<p>
We used this series in college.  With Feynman I often found that the
chapters were easy to read and it seemed like I was following him, but
it was hard to apply what I had learned.  I seem to recall that there
was a separate book of exercises, perhaps by Leighton, cross-referenced
to his chapters?  I can't seem to find it online.  Maybe available from
the Caltech bookstore.

<p>
<a href="1263.html#1372qlink2">&gt; &gt; If anyone has any recommendations for good introductions to </a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; relativity, quantum mechanics, and other topics please let me know.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I wonder if Misner, Thorne, Wheeler _Gravitation_ is worth reading for</i><br>
<i>&gt; you. I like it and it is a standard book, but some may have different</i><br>
<i>&gt; opinions and I'm not sure about the intro potential. Anyway, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely not worth reading until you have the basic physics clear.</i><br>

<p>
The MTW Gravitation is nice because it is marked into two tracks, and you
can stick with track one which gives you a good feel for the subject.

<p>
More accessible though is Spacetime Physics, by Taylor and Wheeler, which
discusses special relativity.  Like the MTW book it takes a geometric
approach.  It turns out that velocity boosts are exactly the same as
coordinate axis rotations, except using hyperbolic geometry rather
than Euclidian.  They have a lot of exercises to help pin down your
understanding, including discussions of many of the traditional paradoxes.

<p>
<a href="1263.html#1372qlink3">&gt; &gt; I'm also interested in sharpening my programming skills which have been </a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; isolated mainly to BASIC and QBASIC at this point.  What computer languages </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are best for beginning my trek toward Coding Deity status?  There seem to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lots of options and my teachers and friends have no ideas about where to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; start.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Like the others, I think C is worth knowing. Pascal - well, it is good</i><br>
<i>&gt; for you, but in my opinion it tastes bad :-) Once you understand C, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would suggest going directly to Java, C++ is in my opinion a bit too</i><br>
<i>&gt; messy.</i><br>

<p>
I agree that C++ is too messy and that Java is superior.  Personally I
would start with Java since that way you are working with objects from
the beginning; you would find it easy to then move to C since the syntax
is 80% the same.  Plus with Java you can make cool web applets from the
start.  I'm not sure what the best Java development system is though;
it would depend on your host.  But there are a lot of recommendations
online.

<p>
<a name="1374qlink1">I'm sure you'll do well whatever path you follow.  It sounds like you
are off to a great start.  Don't forget to spend some time enjoying
life; learning is fun but there are a lot of other fun things to do in
your teens.
