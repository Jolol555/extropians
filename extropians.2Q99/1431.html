<p>
     Australian Museum director Mike Archer said the discovery of a baby =
=93tiger=94 preserved in a jar in his Sydney museum had encouraged him =
over the past year to investigate the possibility of bringing the wolf =
back to life using its DNA.=20
<p>
     His Jurassic Park-style plan was reinforced on Thursday when six =
other baby Tasmanian tigers, also known as the thylacine, were revealed =
in other museums, meaning a greater gene pool could be used and boosting =
the animal=92s chances of future survival.=20

<p>
     La Trobe University=92s senior lecturer in genetics, Mike =
Westerman, said it was possible the thylacine could be cloned in the =
=93not-too-distant future=94 if the funds were available. Archer said he =

<p>
     Sydney=92s pouch-young thylacine was plonked into its jar in 1866 =
and was preserved in alcohol rather than formalin, which would have =

<p>
Spread Out in U.S., UK and Tasmania
<br>
There were thylacines stored in alcohol in the British Museum in London =
and in American museums as well as several in a museum in Australia=92s =
island state, Tasmania.=20
<p>
     Archer said he had previously thought it feasible that Tasmanian =
Tigers, which grew to about 6 feet long including a long rigid tail, and =
have tapering stripes on their bodies, could be sold as pets within 50 =
years.=20

<p>
Restitution for Earlier Hunting
<br>
Australia had a moral duty to revive the Tasmanian tiger, which looked =
similar to a wild dog, after early British settlers in Tasmania =
mercilessly hunted it down to stop it killing flocks of sheep, he said.=20
<p>
     The last known Tasmanian tiger was captured in 1933 and died in a =
zoo in the Tasmanian capital of Hobart in 1936. There have been numerous =
reported sightings of apparent thylacines since then in both Tasmania =
and on the mainland, but no evidence has ever been found to prove they =
still existed.=20
<p>
     Thylacines once roamed the Australian mainland and New Guinea but =
are thought to have lost out in competition with the wild dogs =
introduced by man into both places thousands of years ago and to have =
become extinct long before white settlement.=20
