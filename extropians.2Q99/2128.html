As Brian pointed out, Egan might be reasonable. Besides, you don't
need to use any of his stories, just something in that style. What I
like about the stories above is that they have no obvious special
effects, are set in a near future but still raise important
questions. Especially _The Walk_ shows how it could be done, even if
the story is maybe too minimalistic to work as a movie on its own. But
imagine something more extended based on the same idea (the
possibility of modifying one's beliefs - or other's beliefs - at
will); perhaps a mystery story or family drama, where the
transhumanist stuff creep in slowly and unnoticeably but eventually
become the main philosophical point.
