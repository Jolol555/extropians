OK, suddenly I've been transformed into an immortal being spanning the
universe.

<p>
Actually, it wasn't sudden, it took a couple of thousand years, but
that's trivia compared to the vast expanses of time stretching out
before me (and behind me and in all kinds of other directions, because I
time travel and dimension walk and commune with ancient gods, who did
exist after all but just weren't very useful).

<p>
Now my mind is the surface of a Dyson sphere (kind of crinkly to
maximise surface area), and I have probes and comets and planetoids and
all kinds of vehicles with all kinds of sensors and tools so that I can
juggle quarks or stars, depending on whether I'm feeling introverted or
extroverted.

<p>
But sometimes I'm not discovering new multiverses, rebuilding random
universes from parts, or ruminating on new theories of existence.
Sometimes I'm not off in pursuit of ultimate Truth and Enlightenment.

<p>
How do I veg? Just hang out, waste time, relax a little maybe, but
really just be a blob (no, not grey goo)?

<p>
Maybe muck around with a little border war in an unused galaxy with
another transhuman floating around somewhere (I think territory might be
an issue actually). Travel back in time and watch "General Hospital"
(what an obscene use for time travel). Pop a few planets into my matter
conversion system, just to pass the time (can a transhuman get fat?)

dyson sphere entity does when he/she feels like a nice cup of tea?</a></a>
