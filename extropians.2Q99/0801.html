<a href="0798.html#0801qlink1">&gt;Jocelyn,</a><br>
<i>&gt;Do you know where to get one of those tests?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0809qlink1">I was issued that particular test along with the all-too-obligatory</a> MMPT
while I was in therapy. Or maybe they got those particular results from the
MMPT and I'm remembering wrong -- it was several years ago, and I took a lot
of tests. I have no idea if you can get a copy of those tests as an
individual; they're supposed to be given and interpreted by trained
psychologists and the like. I know that my therapist wasn't the one that
interpreted the results; she sent to somebody else. Do an internet search
<a name="0809qlink2">for the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Test and see what you come up
with -- that's my best advice.
