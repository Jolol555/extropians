True, advances has been made, and the development still continues. The 
main impetus of 21CM's research is not directed towards reducing 
fracturing though: that can be trivially solved by storing neuros at 
-130 C, e.g. in a lab freezer. 21CM is working on robust vitrification 
cum low cryoprotectant toxicity. No available protocol currently
utilizes these advances -- please observe the occurance of "currently" 
in above quote.  So if you'd happen to be dying now, that's tough
luck. Let's hope things will improve, and quickly.
