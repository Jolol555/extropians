<a name="4687qlink1">I would say that tampering with the physical aspects of the human form would
definitely be Transhumanist. I am not so sure about psychological aspects.
What is it that defines us as individuals; our physical forms or our mental
attributes? I can replace a hand with a robotic prosthesis and still not
change my sense of self. But I don't believe that I could wipe out an aspect
of my personality (in the case in question, your apparently-overactive
libido) and still retain that awareness of "self".</a>

<p>
Note that I do not apply this idea to organic brain disorders and the like;
the correction of physical misfunction is different from the modification of
normal functioning.

<p>
<a name="4687qlink2">Note too that the process of changing patterns of thought and behavior
through conscious means (counseling, meditation, whatever) is, in my point
of view, the preferred way to modify behavior. That's because the process
itself becomes a part of the individual's self-identity, and so the
progression from Behavior 1 ("Thoughts of sex occur too frequently") to
Behavior 2 ("Thoughts of sex occur when I choose for them to occur") is a
natural progression in the personal growth of the individual.</a>

You are the first person I've ever heard complain about it, though.

<a name="4687qlink3">I wouldn't suggest that you resign yourself to a completely hedonistic
life-style of 24/7 orgies (although the idea does have its attractions!).
But rather than taking the quick and easy "out" of chemically modifying your
behavior, I'd suggest alternative routes. Just as your sex drive is part of
your identity, make the modification process part of your identity.
Meditation, counseling, even self-hypnosis could all bring your
self-perceived problem under control. Transhumanists in general (myself
included) do sometimes look for a technological answer to problems when
other, more appropriate or effective, methods are available.</a>
