those civilians, 15 are former members of the People's Liberation Army. 
5 have been in the Lao Gai, the Chinese Gulag, for opposing the
government.  25 silently oppose the current regime.  25 vocally support
the current regime.  50 have no opinion, and try to get by from day to
day without getting into trouble.</a>

<a name="4735qlink5">Who deserves to die?  If it is morally acceptable to bomb civilian
targets on the premise that those civilians were supporting an enemy
regime, then it would be moral to blow that building up whether it would
be useful to a military campaign or not.  Clearly, that premise</a></a> is
false.

<p>
<a name="4735qlink6">There may be legitimate military reasons to bomb civilian targets, even
if innocent people die as a result.  But the US has a sufficiently
powerful military to make avoiding blowing up civilians a reasonable
goal, and I think that's commendable.
