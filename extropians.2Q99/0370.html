I got the impression that she lied about that. She knew that he was the
One, but in order for him to assume that mantle, he needed to be told by
her that she wasn't (which she "foresaw" was necessary).</a>

<a name="0382qlink2">On a side note, I really enjoyed the little girl(boy?) that was bending
the spoons in the Oracle's apartment and her(his?) diatribe about
reality being our perceptions and the mind underlying them. If you
change your perceptions you change your reality. Very Eastern oriented
philosophy.
