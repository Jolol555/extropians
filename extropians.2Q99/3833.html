<a name="3943qlink5"><a href="3832.html#3833qlink1">&gt; A simple, relatively low-tech improvement which could easily </a><br>
<i>&gt; be implemented *today* is the "gun-cam";</a> put a small camera </i><br>
<i>&gt; module under the barrel in the same fashion as one would </i><br>
<i>&gt; attach a laser/flashlight module. As (spy) cams can be made </i><br>
<i>&gt; very compact without losing too much picture quality, the setup </i><br>
<i>&gt; needn't be very bulky. You can even add some audio recording</i><br>
<i>&gt; equipment and perhaps even a data transmitter (burst </i><br>
<i>&gt; transmission?) so that even if the gun is seized or destroyed</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the bad guys, you still have the evidence. The camera</i><br>
<i>&gt; could be activated by means of a (pressure) pad on the grip</i><br>
<i>&gt; (a method used for certain laser aiming systems, though</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would personally prefer a system that reacts to pressure</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the trigger for those). That way you only film when it</i><br>
<i>&gt; counts. Further improvement could include a linked </i><br>
<i>&gt; flashlight for when it's dark, and of course some safeties </i><br>
<i>&gt; to prevent tampering with the data.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The advantage? Well, you basically make sure that there's</i><br>
<i>&gt; a camera present at every shooting, filming from the position</i><br>
<i>&gt; which counts most -- that of the shooter. That way a jury/</i><br>
<i>&gt; judge/commission can see for themselves whether a shooting</i><br>
<i>&gt; was justified or not. At the very least every armed government</i><br>
<i>&gt; official should have one, and of course it's highly recommended </i><br>
<i>&gt; for civilian use too.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is such a thing already on the market? If not, I hereby claim</i><br>
<i>&gt; the idea... ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Try selling them to the criminals.
