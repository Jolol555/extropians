<a href="2252.html#2322qlink1">&gt; So there should be a lot less reasons to object carrying a phaser</a><br>
<i>&gt; stun than a conventional gun.  Somehow I doubt that it would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; permitted.  </i><br>

<p>
One would probably need a similar permit as for the air taser, and
of course the countries that don't allow stun guns, like good ol'
Holland and Britain, certainly wouldn't allow this thing --  the very
idea that private citizens could effectively defend themselves gives
those govs (and a good portion of the sheepish public) the shivers.
But hey, screw 'em all!

<p>
<a href="2252.html#2322qlink2">&gt; I'd be happy to carry one though, especially if it's</a><br>
<i>&gt; small and not too expensive.  </i><br>

<p>
Yes, me too. Boyohboyohboy, just think of all the tactical (&amp;fun)
possibilities one would have with this gun. Due to the non-lethal
option, lack of incriminating traces (spent casings, bullets etc.)
and (afaik) the nice side-effect of some short-term memory loss
in the victim, you can go and zap anyone who bothers you, and
get away with it. And what to think of a new, ultra-realistic, "phaser
game" to replace paint ball and those lame laser games?

<p>
Should somebody help him collect money
<br>
<a href="2252.html#2322qlink3">&gt; for a prototype?  sounds like a good investment.</a><br>

<p>
A good investment indeed. It may not be the "ideal" weapon, but
it's damn close. This should sell like crazy. Any ideas on how
one, not having much money, could still get involved and profit
from this development? If this isn't a golden opportunity, nothing
is.
