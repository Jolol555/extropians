First of all, the correct way to do this is *not* to compress the spectrum
to fit within the human range.  With regard to this technique,</a> the problems
<a name="1691qlink2">mentioned above are valid.  The correct technique is to overlay</a> our natural
<a name="1691qlink3">frequency window with shifted windows from other parts of the spectrum.
Audio spectrum overlays are a lot more processing intensive, but they are
much more effective at representing information outside the human range,
and do so with little or no loss of information.</a>

<p>
Even within the normal audio range, the difference between the amount of
information in the signal and the amount of information we can perceive in
a given frequency range is quite large, and gets larger the closer you get
to the ends of our audio range.  This frequency dependent information loss
is a primary reason spectrum compression doesn't work.  Windowing maintains
the normal frequency separation, but creates a "busier" environment within
the normal range, which is something our brains are adept at handling.  Our
audio cortex works much better with good frequency separation and a busy
spectrum than a quiet spectrum and poor frequency separation.  The thing to
remember is that the human ability to separate sounds is a logarithmic
function of frequency, which goes a long way towards explaining why
spectrum compression doesn't work very well.

<p>
There are signal processing algorithms that allow us to shift frequencies
outside of our normal range into our audio range with very little loss of
information.  With good signal processing hardware available today, the
processing loss floor will fall below the perceptive loss at its smallest.
The two biggest problems with this kind of augmentation are 1) it increases
the amount of signal in our fixed perception space that we have to process,
and 2) it misrepresents the actual frequency of the sound (e.g. you hear a
32 kHz tone as a 4 kHz tone).

<p>
The first probably won't be much of a problem most of the time.  Our brains
are already adept at dealing with noisy audio environments.  The second is
a little more of a problem.  The best solution I can think of is to add an
unusual or unnatural harmonic to shifted signals (e.g. "wave shaping") that
will allow the listener to associate a sound with a frequency range.  If
well done it would allow the listener to differentiate signals without
being able to consciously "hear" the added harmonics.  Many audio harmonics
act as something of a meta-signal to the brain.  They describe the nature
of the sound to the brain (the "feeling"), but we do not consciously
perceive the harmonics themselves.
