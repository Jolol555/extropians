I don't think Kinsey's statistics are scientifically useful (or derived).
I believe the best studies to date put the totally gay population at 1-3%,
with another 4-7% of the population having a significant degree
homosexuality.  Not surprisingly, these numbers vary with gender.  I don't
have a reference to point to; these are from the top of my head and are at
least a couple years old.

I could be wrong, but I think this has a lot to do</a> with it.
