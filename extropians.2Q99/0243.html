<a href="0229.html#0243qlink1">&gt;I don't like going to doctors either, but then I think of cases</a><br>
<i>&gt;like muppeteer Jim Henson, who died of pneumonia a couple of years</i><br>
<i>&gt;ago.  I can't help thinking that if he'd gone to the doctor</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead of waiting for that darn cough to go away, he'd be alive</i><br>
<i>&gt;today.</i><br>

<p>
Henson may have waited too long, but the big problem was that he
had a strain of pneumonia that was extremely resistant to
antibiotics. I believe vancomycin was the only antibiotic
effective.

<p>
A tragic loss.
