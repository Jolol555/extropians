<p>
Umm, I haven't seen what they're doing lately, but the core issue seems to
be that to *think* like a human (including learning), the intellect has to
be faced with the same sorts of sensorimotor issues and answers as humans,
to the greatest extent possible. It's close (perhaps closer than
analogous) to the observation that if you want a vision system to see like
a human, it has to be fooled by the same optical illusions as a human.

<p>
Trivial example of the former: what good is a tennis racket to an insect?
How would you explain one to it? If you did, would it be able to use it?

<p>
This _is_ ironically connected to themes in _The Matrix_, by the way. :)
