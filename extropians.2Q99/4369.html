Hi Alex, I'm a more libertarian prone extropian from New Hampshire. I've
included my opinions and recommendations on the subjects below, but I want to
say that what is more important is how these technologies shape our lives and
our society. We can already see the threat to our liberties that many
technologies pose, as well as the potential for technologies to help us regain
liberties we have lost in the past century due to the encroachment of government
and business into our lives.

<p>
life extension: this is a rather broad subject, involving everything from
telomere research, cloning and organ in vitro growth, cryonics and other
metabolic suspension technologies, even safety and security. Even a biologically
immortal human being is going to have an average life expectancy of around 4600
years, given current accident mortality rates. Ask people like Jim Halperin and
Damien Broderick about this. The fact is that our grandparent's generation is
the last mortal generation.

<p>
citizens-in-space: the current high cost of space launch technology is a direct
consequence of the Kennedy administration's decision to scrap the Dyna-Soar
space plane concept in favor of custom built, single use ballistic missiles in
order to beat the Russians to the moon, as well as the long standing excessive
bureaucratic barriers to entry for private launching companies. The other
hang-ups are technological: materials and propulsion. The materials technology
is now there, but we are still using the same old chemical fuel/oxidizer rockets
we used in the 60's, which are notoriously inefficient. I have hopes for
projects like Hudson's Rotary Rocket and Klapp's Pioneer Rocketplane as a first
step for innovative work-arounds.
<br>
The next step will involve Ram-Rockets being launched by a ground based
electromagnetic slingshot, or by laser batteries (
<a href="http://www.dtic.mil/soldiers/mar1998/news/news06.html">http://www.dtic.mil/soldiers/mar1998/news/news06.html</a> ,
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DyeHard/dye990421.html">http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DyeHard/dye990421.html</a> ). Look up the
"Lorrey Loop" on HotBot for a concept of a fully developed space launch system
using such technologies in a mass transit project.

<p>
better computers: they are here, and getting better all the time. What is
lacking is the sort of AI that most people expect to see due to science fiction
movies and tv shows. Once desktop computers have the processing capability of
the human brain (you'll see this around 2020-2025, maybe earlier) people can
expect conversational, intelligent computer buddies/employees. In the mean-time,
so called 'weak AI' chatterbots and intelligent agents are getting more
powerful, which will continue to the point where strong AI moves seamlessly in
to replace weak AI. There will be a point where nobody will notice when they
stopped regarding their AI companions as computers and started regarding them as
real people.

<p>
Personal flying machines: the technology is here. The problem is legal. Civil
aviation liability insurance, both for manufacturers and vehicle owners, is
extremely high due to the lack of tort reform, which inflates the cost to buy
and operate aircraft, and limits manufacturers abilities to invest in innovative
new designs.

<p>
Teleporting: I think its relatively safe to conclude that this will be
practically impossible until humanity has passed through a rather steep
technological event horizon. Don't expect before 2060, if ever. A suitable
substitute that might suffice would be the following:
Once mind uploading becomes possible, there will come to exist body rental
agencies, so that uploaded minds can transmit themselves around the world (or
across space) to a location and be downloaded into a rental body. The only real
hitch, beyond the technological, is holding the proper entities responsible for
acts commited (especially illegal acts) by a rented body. This segues into the
'head transplant' concept, which is backward. The mind is what is important. The
proper term is 'body transplants'.

<p>
Beyond this, I think that Eliezer Yudkowski has pretty well summed up my
thinking, although I don't share his introverted attitude against physical
technologies. I plan on being in space when his nanotopian experiments occur on
earth. I'll be mining the asteroids, or ferrying comets for the Mars
Terraforming Project, or on a mission to an earth-like world that the NASA
Interferometry Telescope has located around a nearby star, using an Alcubierre
drive, possibly....
