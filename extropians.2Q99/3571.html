<i>&gt; A good idea for those of us who are physically able to do so. I must admit</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Would you deny someone who cannot use martial arts any defense? A person in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a wheelchair, for instance? Someone with one arm in a cast?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In any case, once someone has forced entry to your private quarters, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; should you have to even ask questions? This person is there illegally, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; at least this should be the case. The fact that they are there at all</i><br>
<i>&gt; should allow you to assume the worst of intents.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yeah, I know - someone's going to bring up the case where a family member</i><br>
<i>&gt; came in late at night and got shot. Here's a case where the shooter did not</i><br>
<i>&gt; verify that an intrusion had actually taken place before firing. Bad or no</i><br>
<i>&gt; training, or just trigger happy. Some of the problem is resolved by</i><br>
<i>&gt; requiring certification to buy weapons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here in my county, I have heard tell of the sherriff's police advising</i><br>
<i>&gt; citizens to be sure any intruder they shoot 'falls inside the house' so</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the shooting is justifiable - even if this involves dragging that</i><br>
<i>&gt; person a few feet. They don't want to charge someone who is defending</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One of the great travesties of our legal system is the way the victim has</i><br>
<i>&gt; become the persecuted - criminals successfully suing because of injuries</i><br>
<i>&gt; suffered in commission of crimes. Such suits (civil) would be rejected by</i><br>
<i>&gt; any sensible person, but our judges and juries seem to think otherwise,</i><br>
<i>&gt; when confronted by a cunning attorney.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
As long as a person is a responsible, sane and nonviolentcriminal 
adult, they should be quite willing to accept the consequences of 
their decisions, and thus be fully eligible to possess firearms; 
otherwise, not.
