Mark stated,

<p>
<a href="1336.html#1343qlink1">"For your utopia to succeed, you'll have to use force to stop me getting</a><br>
what I want."

<p>
Do you really believe that our basic goals are so contrary that I would
not get what I want by helping you get what you want?  Mark, I don't
think you realize how easily others can lead you around by your desires
(like dangling a carrot in front of a donkey).  You are actually quite
<a name="1347qlink1">helpless to resist those who offer you what you want.</a>  Would you refuse
your own desires?  Because I am intelligent, I would never use force to
modify your behavior.  If I did, you would resist me.  Because I am
intelligent, I would use your own deepest desires to change whatever
behaviors I wanted to.  

<p>
I can get far more cooperation out of you by helping you then by forcing
you.

<p>
<a name="1347qlink2"><a name="1345qlink1">My utopia is all about helping everyone achieve what they really want.</a> 
Why would anyone resist</a> that?
