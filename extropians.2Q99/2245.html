I'm out of town until Monday and on the run, but feel compelled to respond to

Count me in the "sick of it" category.

<p>
I would.

<p>
Not only would I support such a reduction, but as soon as I have some time, 
intend to take steps to enforce the list guidelines all subscribers have 
agreed to when joining the list.  

<p>
So it's clear, ALL POSTERS ON THE GUN THREADS PLEASE READ THIS:

<p>
The list guidelines clearly prohibit personalistic attacks and the kind of 
offensive rhetoric I've seen in the sampling of the recent gun debate I've 
seen.  There have been enough complaints about it that I consider ExI's Board 
to have freedom of action to notify offenders of list suspension.

<p>
As a lawyer and someone interested in social issues (including politics), I 
believe this list IS a proper place for reasoned and civil discussion of 
social issues.  But offensive language and personalistic rhetoric does not 
have a place here.  This limit on behavior is clearly set out in the 
subscription terms.  List suspension is our only real sanction -- so folks 
who have engaged in offensive and personalistic rhetoric, please consider 
yourself on notice.
  
<p>
<a href="2228.html#2245qlink4">&gt;  I'll tally the data.</a><br>

<p>
Thank you, James.
