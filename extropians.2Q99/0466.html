Yes the technology has seemed to finally catch up enough to make
UWB applications possible. As I said, time-domain.com has already
built several devices including a set of stealth radios for
the military. An even cooler device is a "localizer" being
developed by a company called AetherWire. Sort of like your own
personal GPS system. They already have working prototypes.

<i>&gt; Close, but not quite. I wondered when this would resurface. It is spread</i><br>
<i>&gt; spec of a sort, but done because the Fourier frequency spectrum of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely short pulse is extremely broad. There was a flurry of interest</i><br>
<i>&gt; in this in Av Week and some other military journals in the late</i><br>
<i>&gt; 80s/early 90s. There was talk of it not panning out on one hand because</i><br>
<i>&gt; the technology just wasn't quite there (which is my leaning), and on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other hand that funding was curtailed because at that time partly</i><br>
<i>&gt; because of concern that the extremely wide band of frequency emitted by</i><br>
<i>&gt; a pulse radar could detect a conventionally stealthed aircraft (The</i><br>
<i>&gt; conspiracy side of it, that I had doubts about). In any case it vanished</i><br>
<i>&gt; for some years, but the article indicates that the high frequency SiGe</i><br>
<i>&gt; transistor technology that IBM among others has been developing may make</i><br>
<i>&gt; it viable now by allowing the tight timing limits needed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Another interesting idea that came out about the same time was some</i><br>
<i>&gt; surface acoustic wave delay line signal processing systems done by EDI</i><br>
<i>&gt; that also promised some pretty amazing radar advances (don't they</i><br>
<i>&gt; always? ;). Looked quite interesting, though, again, the technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't look like it was quite there, and it slipped back out of sight. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather wonder what happened to that bunch. I'll check up on them again</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a month or so when I move back to the Urbana area (where they were</i><br>
<i>&gt; based).</i><br>
