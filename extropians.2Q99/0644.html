John Walker's "Home Planet" is pretty fine for what it is (freeware Win
amateur astronomy app).

<p>
Joe-Mike says check out the Index Librorum Liberorum at
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.to/">http://www.fourmilab.to/</a> (the USA mirror) 
or <a href="http://fourmilab.ch/">http://fourmilab.ch/</a> (the Swiss site). Besides the stuff mentioned on
the home page, you can 
<br>
click on the sidebar "Astronomy and Space" entry. Kewl.

Excerpts taken from the site:

<p>
Orbits in Strongly Curved Spacetime

<p>
An interactive Java applet which illustrates how orbits around compact
objects such as
<br>
neutron stars and black holes depart drastically from Kepler's laws, and
explains why.
<br>
Source code for the applet is available. 

<p>
Solar System Live

<p>
Solar System Live, an interactive orrery for the Web, lets you view the
solar system in
<br>
a variety of ways for any date between 4713 B.C. and A.D. 8000. An
ephemeris can
<br>
be displayed for any location on Earth and, given orbital elements in the
form published
<br>
in the IAU Circulars, the orbit and position of asteroids and comets can be
plotted. 

<p>
Your Sky

<p>
Your Sky makes custom maps of the sky for any location on Earth and any
date from
<br>
4713 B.C. into the distant future. Maps can include stars as faint as
magnitude 6.5,
<br>
constellation names, outlines, and boundaries, the Moon and planets, deep
sky objects
<br>
from a database of more than 500, and a comet or asteroid whose position is
calculated from its orbital elements. A variety of display options allow
customising the
<br>
map for its intended use. 

<p>
The Oh-My-God Particle (paper)

<p>
On October 15th, 1991 a proton with an energy of 3×1020 electron volts slammed
into in the Earth's atmosphere. Let's crunch some numbers.... A performance
comparison with 24th century Galaxy Class starship technology is presented. 

<p>
Inconstant Moon

<p>
Inconstant Moon explores a universally seen but seldom observed phenomenon:
the
<br>
different appearance of the Moon at perigee and apogee. 

<p>
C-ship

<p>
The only reason Einstein's special theory of relativity seems weird to
those learning it is
<br>
that the velocities we're familiar with are such a tiny fraction of the
speed of light we've
<br>
never had a chance to gain an intuitive sense of relativistic effects. If
the speed of light
<br>
were 100 kilometres per hour, footballers would have no trouble dealing with
relativistic goal shots. C-ship uses computer image synthesis to put you
aboard a
<br>
starship entirely consistent with the laws of physics and lets you look out
the window
<br>
to experience special relativity with your own eyes.
