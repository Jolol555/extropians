Who knows?  I'd say that so far it's caught on with scientists, not
sciences.  Don't know what percentage of scientists, either, but I'd be
surprised to find that more than 10% had even heard of transhumanism,
much less the Singularity.  Of course, with the few Wired articles, it
could be more than that by now.

Ashley Dunn wrote "In Vinge's &lt;something&gt;, an oracle of digital doom"
for the New York Times, although it may have been only for the
"CyberTimes" Web-only section - I'm not sure.

<p>
It will be a 60-Minutes show when enough people write in and ask for
one; after which they'll get everything wrong, make a big issue of
Frankenscience, interview only people who are hostile to the concept, do
something horrible to the term like what happened to "hackers", and in
general put everyone off their lunch for years to come.

<p>
For my money, the best bet for publicizing the concept would be a sequel
to _The Matrix_.
