{8^D  Actually, they took down the network as a precautionary
measure.  In any big company it takes a while to check all the systems.

Yes, a few perhaps, but the whole melissa thing (which by the way is
just starting) could have easily been prevented.  My Microsoft
annoyance needle is already pegged.  Somewhere I should
mention that I use MS products almost continuously, every day
at work.  Ive been an excel user for over 12 yrs, automating
many processes using macros.  But MS word macros I have found
not particularly useful.  But they *are* dangerous, in their
present form.  I do hope Bill risks a few annoyed users.  Anyone
who has ever used Powerpoint for Mac can define the
term annoyance.  spike
