<a name="1019qlink1"><a name="1018qlink1"><a name="1017qlink1"><a name="1015qlink1"><a name="1014qlink1">I have been intrigued by this subject in the past and have intended to
pursue analysis of Neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield's experiences</a> with conscious
</a>
<a name="1014qlink2">subjects undergoing brain surgery...apparrently, while such</a> individuals were
<a name="1015qlink2"><a name="1014qlink3">undergoing surgery they experienced TOTAL recall of rather unremarkable
events in their lives...such as "being in the kitchen washing the dishes
while my husband is on the phone...he is saying "" (what follows is a
verbatim repeat of the conversation about unimportant matters).
</a>
</a>
</a>

<p>
<a name="1019qlink2"><a name="1018qlink2"><a name="1017qlink2">Penfield was so shocked by this occurrence that he made it a subject of
considerable investigation during his career. I think we might be getting
close to a time when our brain scanning technology could take</a> a renewed look
</a>
<a name="1015qlink3"><a name="1014qlink4">at this phenomenon.
</a>
</a>
</a>

<p>
Further investigation for extropian readers is the book "of two minds" by
Dr. Fredric Schiffer.
<br>
who makes a convincing argument for each person having at least two
<br>
<a href="1012.html#1013qlink1">"personnas" living one each in each cortical hemisphere...(I've</a> always felt</a><br>
</a>
<a name="1015qlink4"><a name="1014qlink5">this way, but have been of two minds on the subject :-)

<p>
Finally, for the really adventurous...look into a book which takes a
forensic approach to hypnotism, prior life experiences, and multiple
personality disorder...very provacative, and extremely well
researched...makes the point that it appears that the human</a> mind synthesizes
</a>
<a name="1015qlink5"><a name="1014qlink6">complete memories and personalities out of the rich fabric of 100%
completely stored memories not consciously recalled or available.</a> And here's
</a>
<a name="1015qlink6"><a name="1014qlink7">the REALLY interesting thing...I can't remember either the title or the
Author's full name...first name I think was IAN.

<p>
Thesis: The stuff is in there...opportunity...technology which
gives/restores conscious access to everything ever experienced/learned</a> in an
</a>
<a name="1014qlink8">on demand non-destructive/intrusive fashion.

<p>
what would you pay for a pill to give you this?

<p>
I would pay $50,000 today
