<a name="0081qlink3"><i>&gt;treatment; that might well not improve mortality.</i><br>

</a>
<p>
<a name="0085qlink1">But maybe most treatment is optional or speculative.  If so, maybe we could
spend 1/3 what we do now and be just as healthy.</a>

<a name="0085qlink2"><i>&gt;we don't normally get) doesn't help.  People get things like appendicitis,</i><br>
<i>&gt;pneumonia in the young, and gangrene which were major risks in the past</i><br>
<i>&gt;but &gt;very rarely die of them.</i><br>
</a>

<p>
<a name="0085qlink3"><a name="0081qlink5">Sure we are lots healthier now than in the past.  The question</a> is how much
credit medicine deserves for that.  Lots of other things have changed besides
medicine.

<i>&gt;&gt; million Medicare patients, using regional spending variations</a> of a factor</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of two (controlling for lots of stuff), found that any mortality benefit of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; spending in the last six months of life is less than a one part in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; thousand.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0085qlink4"><a name="0081qlink7"><i>&gt;That sounds like a biased sample.  People who die within six</a> months are</i><br>
<i>&gt;people for whom treatment has failed.  If medical treatment works, they</i><br>

</a>

<p>
<a name="0081qlink8">It is a random sample of all Medicare patients.  It looks</a> at 5000 hospital
regions in the country, and predicts total mortality in each region from
a long list of features, one of which is how much is spent there in the
<a name="0085qlink5"><a name="0081qlink9">last six months of life.  I gave the URL for it - take a look</a> for yourself:
