<i>&gt; &gt;Will you still feel the same way if that racist Australian political party</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;get a majority, and hence control all the guns in government hands?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;No one needs to have weapons to kill people at a distance.  The only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;reason to have them is to protect yourself from people who have them. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;So why is it that a large fraction (possibly the vast majority) of bullets</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;are fired at little pieces of paper? I've shot an awful lot of them myself</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in the past, and precisely 0.00000000000% of them have been fired at another</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;person. If the only reason to own a gun is to shoot people who try to shoot</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you, why are most guns used for target shooting or (in America) hunting?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even if your only use for a gun is defense, it makes sense to be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use it effectively - hence target shooting. Because I practice</i><br>
<i>&gt; periodically, I am sure of hitting what I aim at.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the real concern is 'death at a distance', we must immediately ban all</i><br>
<i>&gt; rifles and long barrel shotguns. Handguns are only accruate enough to hit a</i><br>
<i>&gt; person within 25 feet in many people's hands. Any good full choke shotgun</i><br>
<i>&gt; can kill at 50 yards. Rifles can kill at over a mile, with a good scope and</i><br>
<i>&gt; steady aim.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have had exactly one opportunity to even have a gun in my hand in</i><br>
<i>&gt; anticipation of use against another person, in over twenty-five years of</i><br>
<i>&gt; ownership. A drunk was battering my door at 2 AM in the middle of winter. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; called the police - he was escorted to a nice warm cell to sleep it off - I</i><br>
<i>&gt; never even needed to put my finger on the trigger. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If this individual had suceeded in gaining entry, though, I would have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to either hold him off or disable him if necessary, to defend my</i><br>
<i>&gt; family. If I had not had the gun, my only option would have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; hand-to-hand combat with someone possibly much stronger than myself. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I will keep my weapon just in case.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
If you have neither been convicted of a violent crime nor judged 
mentally incompetent by a psychiatric board (you have a family, so 
are obviously of age), I have no problem with you retaining your 
weapon.
