<a name="1988qlink2"><a name="1982qlink1"><a name="1980qlink4"><a name="1979qlink3">I'm probably going to provoke more rancid vitriol and get shot down in
flames for saying this,<a name="1974qlink3"> but just because something is written in your
<a name="2049qlink2">precious constitution or your bill of rights does not mean that it is the be
all and end all, that it is simply the only thought worth entertaining and
</a>
no alternatives shall be brooked.</a> If this were the case, can you explain to
me exactly why there are so many, or indeed *any* ammendments to your
</a>
constitution? I can think of one answer to this: Because it is imperfect. It
<a name="1988qlink3">was a hashed up solution to the problems of the time and no clear thought
was given to its long term consequences.<a name="1974qlink4"> As such, situations have arisen
which the constitution was never designed to contend with and it has had to
</a>be modified. It is in no way set in stone.<a name="2049qlink3"> Times change, and laws must
change with them. To advocate extropian beliefs on the one hand, and
</a>
<a name="1988qlink4">dogmatic adherence to a quite clearly imperfect constitution on the other
hand seems somewhat at odds to me.<a name="1974qlink5"> But excuse me if I am stepping on your
constitutionally protected toes here, I mean no harm, I'm just curious as to
how you can rationalize this.</a>

<p>
<a name="2049qlink4"><a name="1979qlink4"><a name="1974qlink6">As for the merit of this discussion on the list, is it something along the
lines of:

</a>
<p>
*I'm looking to the future, but I'll shoot you if you get in my way.<br>
</a>

<p>
Or maybe:

<p>
<a name="1980qlink5">*Well, shucks ma, the end times are a-comin', let's arm ourselves to the<br>
teeth and head for the hills.</a></a>

<p>
Not very extropian admittedly, but as far as I can see, neither is this
thread.</a>
