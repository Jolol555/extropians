I'm not sure where I would put memes in the hierarchy of mental 
constructs, but it seems to me that you have given some examples 
that I would definitely call memes mixed with some that are at 
some higher level. I would call love of freedom a meme, neophilia 
another, and consider rationalism, for want of a better word, to be a 
basic meme that differentiates most of "us" from most of "them".

<p>
Ideas and value judgments like "content [of this thread] does not 
justify volume" I would class as concepts that are based on various 
memes that determine what values you are likely to assign to the 
given content.

<p>
My ideas on the subject are pretty half-baked. I should probably go 
do some reading, too, except that I am infected with the &lt;soft 
science and philosophy are horseshit&gt; meme :)
