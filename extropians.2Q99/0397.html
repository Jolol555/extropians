Start out with one guy at a university who is studying AI technology,
who is overburdened by bureaucratic opression and a campus wide
luddite/greens type of political correctness. Unbeknownst to him, one of
the people he collaborates with over the net is actually an AI developed
by an extropic group. Our protagonist creates his own AI by a type of
mind augmentation/budding process, and becomes the object of a manhunt
by the government, relgionists, and luddites, and is being helped to
find shelter by his unseen extropic allies.
