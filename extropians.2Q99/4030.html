Cloning may save extinct species
<br>
China Daily

<p>
WASHINGTON (Agencies via Xinhua) _ Researchers said on Monday they had
nearly succeeded in cloning an endangered species of sheep and said the
experiment showed the idea is workable.

<p>
They said they produced a pregnancy using genetic material from a rare Asian
sheep known as the argali, and cow's eggs.

<p>
The pregnancy failed and no sheep was born, but Kenneth White of Utah State
University in Logan and colleagues there and at the Oregon Regional Primate
Research Centre said they believed the technique could be perfected to try
to save endangered species.

<p>
"The successful production of viable young using this approach would provide<br>
a tremendous impact on the ability to regenerate animal numbers in these
species," they wrote in the first issue of a new journal, Cloning.

<p>
Cloning is being used now mostly by laboratories trying to produce
specialized animals for agricultural uses or medical research. However, one
proposed benefit has been the use of cloning technology to breed endangered
species.

<p>
"Species extinctions have occurred since life began on Earth, but human<br>
activities are causing the loss of biological diversity at an unprecedented
rate," White's team wrote.

<p>
"Cells from endangered or threatened species can be cryopreserved (frozen)<br>
and maintained in what has been referred to as the 'frozen zoo' and then
later used as nuclear donors for cloning purposes."

<p>
Argali sheep have several subspecies, including the Altai sheep, Marco
Polo's sheep and Tibetan sheep. They used Altai sheep and fertilized the egg
by nuclear transfer technology _ the same technique used by Ian Wilmut and
his colleagues at Scotland's Roslin Institute to make Dolly the sheep, the
first cloned mammal.
