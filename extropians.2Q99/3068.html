<a href="3008.html#3068qlink1">&gt; My dyslexic younger brother with his 120 IQ could not hope to be as</a><br>
<i>&gt; analytical, logical, and quick thinking as I, while I, with my 160 IQ, will only</i><br>
<i>&gt; rarely think on the level of an even greater genius, if at all.</i><br>

<p>
Richard Fynnmen's verbal skills were weak, and he only scored 125 on a IQ test, yet
he was probably the great physist of our time.  Have your bother take the IQ test
<a href="http://www.iqtest.com">http://www.iqtest.com</a>, where they measure and report on 15 separate skills.

<p>
<a name="3140qlink1">I found out that 14 of my 15 abilities were 20-30 points higher than you would
expect from my single number IQ score. Considering that your brother is dyslexic,
</a>
<a name="3140qlink2">and still manages to score 120, I wouldn't be surprised if your brother share some,
</a>
<a name="3140qlink3">but not all, of your talents.
