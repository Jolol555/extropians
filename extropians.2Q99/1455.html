World's First Cloned Pig to Be Born Within Months
Xinhua English Newswire

<p>
The world's first cloned pig should be born within months, British 
scientists predicted Thursday.

<p>
Researchers at Geron Bio-Med, a commercial spin-off of the Scotland-based 
Roslin Institute which produced Dolly the Sheep, told BBC they believed that 
cloned pigs will arrive by early 2000 at the latest.

<p>
Professor Ian Wilmutt, who helped develop the cloning technology known as 
nuclear transfer that produced Dolly, said he was hopeful of seeing cloned 
piglets "later this year or early in the new millennium".

<p>
The scientists hoped that eventually they could modify the technology to 
make other pig clones whose organs can be transplanted into humans.

<p>
Currently there are many more patients needing a transplant than there are 
donor organs available, and scientists believe pigs could fill this tissue 
gap.

<p>
Geron Bio-Med also believes its cloning technology is the key to producing 
animal tissue that is safe to use in humans, which the company hopes would 
help overcome the problems of rejection in organ transplant.
