Did they close down this shop? No. They would rather allow the illegal
sales to continue so that Mayor Daley could be the big man and sue gun
manufacturers, etc. - and make lots of media attention for himself.

<p>
If the police and prosecutors refuse to take action against illegal
sellers, they are more responsible for the carnage than the sellers
themselves. These officials should be prosecuted for malfeasance in office.
