<a href="1946.html#1965qlink1">&gt; With your statements above and Eugene response to them </a><br>

<p>
Hmm, I didn't get Eugene's mail afaik...

<a name="2048qlink1"><a href="1946.html#1965qlink2">&gt; Also, one could think of such a cryo unit as something which a</a><br>
<i>&gt; suspension team could talk other people through using -- people</i><br>
<i>&gt; who are on site, but don't have medical or suspension skills.</i><br>

<p>
Good idea. Perhaps you could even use a camera (via the web) for
even better feedback in some cases.</a>

<p>
<a name="2048qlink2"><a href="1946.html#1965qlink3">&gt; In regard to this, I'd like to see someone attempt just something</a><br>
<i>&gt; simple first.  Afterward, he/she/they could improve upon it, solving</i><br>
<i>&gt; the perfusion and other problems -- rather than waiting for a perfect</i><br>
<i>&gt; robot/remote suspension unit.  Chances are the latter will develop</i><br>
<i>&gt; too late for many people..</i><br>

<p>
Yes, it's good to start with a relatively simple model (mainly external
cooling, which is presumably the most important), and expand from 
there (add cryovent, ways to inject medication and finally perfusion
equipment). That would certainly be a useful thing to do for local groups.
