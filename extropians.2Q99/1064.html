Adult Human Brain Stem Cells Reproduce In Vitro

<p>
Brain stem cells recovered from living adult human tissue have 
successfully reproduced in vitro at the University of Tennessee-
 health science center. Additional research from the same 
laboratory also shows successful isolation and cultivation of mouse 
brain stem cells recovered as long as five to seven days postmortem. 
Scheduled this month for publication in a special issue of 
Experimental Neurology, these findings could provide a possible 
alternative to the research use of embryonic stem cells, an approach 
in stem cell biology and its possible therapeutic use that raises 
controversial ethical issues. 

<p>
Dr. Valery G. Kukekov of UT-Memphis and Methodist Healthcare of 
Memphis, is lead author on the paper detailing the growing of adult 
brain stem cells recovered from surgical specimens taken from 
patients ranging in age from 24 to 57. The paper is titled 
<br>
"Multipotent Stem/Progenitor Cells with Similar Properties Arise from <br>
Two Neurogenic Regions of Adult Human Brain." 

<p>
Dr. Eric D. Laywell of UT-Memphis is lead author of the paper 
detailing the growing of brain stem cells recovered from mouse 
cadavers five to seven days postmortem. Laywell's paper is titled 
<br>
"Multipotent Neurospheres Can Be Derived from Forebrain Subependymal <br>
Zone and Spinal Cord of Adult Mice after Protracted Postmortem 
Intervals." 

<p>
The work is from the laboratory of Dr. Dennis A. Steindler, UT-
 professor of neurobiology and a co-author on both papers. 
Describing the work, Steindler said, "This new era of applying 
knowledge gained from genetics, molecular, cellular and developmental 
biology is much more than just the discussion of the ethical issues 
surrounding embryonic and fetal cell research, and the controversy 
over cloning animals and human beings. 

<p>
"This new research showing that stem/progenitor cells from adult <br>
brains can be expanded in culture (ex vivo) offers hope for future 
studies which could someday lead to autologous stem cell transplants 
for self-repair regenerative approaches," said Steindler. "It now is 
possible to think about using our own population of stem cells 
because it appears they survive well into mature adulthood." 

<p>
Kukekov's research recovered cells from the hippocampus and the 
subependymal zone (SEZ). The SEZ is a remnant left over from the 
fetal/baby brain region remaining in the adult brain that surrounds 
the fluid-filled spaces called ventricles. 

<p>
<a name="1080qlink1">Kukekov said, "These results are encouraging because it means that 
even senior persons have these cells. This gives us the opportunity 
in the future, as the research expands, to take a small biopsy 
specimen from a diseased person, grow the necessary cells and then 
transplant them back to the same person."</a> 

<p>
Kukekov said the research team is now working on describing the 
molecular biologic characteristics of the cultured cells. "We cannot 
move forward and be successful in experiments with propagation 
without knowing how genes are expressed in the process and what 
molecular events are occurring." 

<p>
Laywell's work with cadaveric mice successfully isolated and 
recovered stem cells up to five to seven days after death when the 
mice were kept at 4 degrees C. The cells were retrieved from the 
adult mouse spinal cord and forebrain SEZ. Using the culturing 
technique developed by Kukekov, the mouse cells grew and multiplied 
and gave rise to both neurons and glia. 

<p>
Laywell said the number of surviving cells drops off rapidly with 
time, but since they appear to be stem cells, only one is needed to 
multiply in culture. 

<p>
Laywell said, "Bone marrow stem cells have been repopulated from 
cadavers, so it seems to be a property of stem cells in general that 
they can survive in conditions that other cells can't." 

<p>
Laywell's paper includes a single human-cadaver unpublished 
observation which produced results similar to those found with the 
mice. 

<p>
The research is an international collaborative effort with coinvestigators
 in Bonn, Germany; Japan, and Memphis. The adult brain 
tissue was provided with patient consent by Dr. Keith G. Davies, a 
neurosurgeon with UT-Memphis and Semmes-Murphey Clinic and a coauthor
 on the adult cell paper. 

<p>
Kukekov's work was funded by the Methodist/Le Bonheur Healthcare 
Foundation. 

<p>
Laywell's work was funded by the Spinal Cord Research Foundation of 
the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA). Steindler's work was funded 
by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Daimler-Benz 
Foundation funded the work of co-author Dr. Bjorn Scheffler. - By
