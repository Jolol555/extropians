No. One would think that when I explicitly referred to libertarian socialists
in my message someone with a reasonable level of reading comprehension might
not jump to such a knee-jerk reaction.</a>

Well, you're either a libertarian or an authoritarian, there is no in
between... unless you're schizophrenic. Either you believe in letting other
people do what they want to do as long as they don't interfere with your
life, or you don't. Devotion to 'reasonable, rational compromise' is one
of the 20th Century's biggest problems.

<p>
I agree with Hal; you can be a free-market libertarian, a socialist 
libertarian, or a communist libertarian, a christian libertarian, a 
pagan libertarian, or a satanist libertarian; the only requirement is 
that your choice must be voluntary, you can't force anyone else to join 
you. Even (big-L) Libertarians are normally socialists with their families 
and friends, because most of us recognize that free markets simply aren't 
useful when you get down to that small a scale.

Where did I say you did? I was referring to the numerous Borganists who've
joined the list and explicitly posted their Borgtopian fantasies.

<p>
Cool. Where did I say that? Oh, I didn't, did I, you made it up. That said,
all authoritarians do agree with Stalin that they know better than the rest
of us and have a right to impose their views by force.

<p>
<a href="2645.html#2763qlink5">&gt;Just like when people assume you agree with Hitler, or calls you fascist.</a><br>
<i>&gt;You </i><br>

<p>
Indeed; like being called a 'dangerous nut' for thinking that people should
be able to buy and carry guns without having to beg some obnoxious 
bureaucrat's permission. But what relevance does this have to anything I
said?
