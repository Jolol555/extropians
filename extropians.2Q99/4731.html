Hey, this is a good subject. I read a short story in one of the SF pulp
magazines in December of 1989 or January of 1990 that was a cyberpunk detective
story. It started out with an alcoholic detective in the down and out getting
hired by the wired aristocracy to solve her father's murder. The key technology
of the story is a bracelet you wear if you are part of the aristocracy that acts
as a base for nanotech to maintain your body, as well as providing an mind
uplink into the net. The price for such a bracelet was $2 million. The girl's
father was the person who invented the braclet.  Who is the author and what is
the title of the story?
