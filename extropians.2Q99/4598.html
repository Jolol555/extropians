Actually, not only is he allowed to make these kind of comments, but
he's also allowed to dress me down for snapping at him.  I try to live
by Crocker's Rules, which means that if anything offends me, it's my
fault - I've made a commitment to the mental discipline of anyone being
able to tell me anything.  And, in deed if not in thought, I've failed
to keep up the discipline; and now the next guy who thinks I'm full of
it will be more reluctant to tell me so.

<p>
Actually, my response wasn't addressed so much to Doug Jones in
particular, so much as the culture in which I feel he is embedded.  I
really didn't intend for him to feel targeted.  Crocker's Rules don't
say anything about getting annoyed at ideas.  But I can see how it would
look that way.
