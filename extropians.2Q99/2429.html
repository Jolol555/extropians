fit of paranoid hysteria:

 To which James Rogers &lt;jamesr@best.com&gt; duly responded:
<br>
<a name="2483qlink1"><a href="2406.html#2429qlink2">&gt; Actually, I think you misread the intent of the quote.  This particular</a><br>
<i>&gt; quote is often used as an ironic example of historical revisionism or</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps cultural license.</a>  American cultural mythology paints Abraham</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lincoln as a man whose great ambition was to end slavery and racism.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact, he had no particular interest in these issues and only freed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; slaves when it was to his political benefit.  The only racism implied would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be that of Lincoln.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2483qlink2">Exactly, that was the point of the "sig". It was a (tongue-in-cheek) 
response to someone else's Lincoln sig, namely:</a>

<p>
<a name="2483qlink3"><a href="1666.html#2429qlink3">&gt; "Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds</a> to be." </a><br>
-Lincoln 

<p>
Note that people such as Mr.Broderick have devalued the term
"racism" to a point where it has become little more than a brainless,
meaningless knee-jerker. A word used by bullies to quickly stigmatize 
people &amp; subjects and to stem all meaningful discussion (like "witch" in 
the Middle Ages and "communist" in the fifties). It's sad to see this
kind of vile crap on a list that allegedly promotes intelligent, openminded
 discourse.
