Ah yes - words like... `gun'.

<p>
Not quite.  I recall pointing out that `abo' has much the same smell to it
in Australia that `nigger' does in the USA.  I wasn't offended by your use,
because there's no way most Americans would be likely to know that.  But
having been alerted to this nuance (a matter of local historical
contingency, but there it is), I'd certainly expect people to behave
sensitively by avoiding its use thereafter.

Of course that was not my objection.  I can read, I can understand exactly
what he said and what he meant.  But I don't intend to drag out and repost
<a name="2640qlink3">the more explicitly racist crap from den Otter's achived posts.</a>  The
<a name="2640qlink4">context is there for inspection.  (You will recall that he agitated to have
a special invitation-only list set up so such discussion - which he
labelled `politically incorrect', thereby proving himself a brave</a> rebel -
<a name="2640qlink5">could go on away from public scrutiny.)</a>
