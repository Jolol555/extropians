As I prepare to leave this list, I thought it would be appropriate to bring
up the list's rules, which are rather to-the-point about arguments and
flaming.  So I would suggest to certain parties that, although for some odd
reason they haven't been held accountable for all this foolish bickering,
they curb the foolishness.  Here it is, straight from the mouth of the
beast.

<p>
 5d) Rules about fighting and insulting; fighting and insulting 
 are not allowed!

<p>
 5e) If someone starts a fight with you what should you do?; we have a
 private legal code set-up to handle such disputes which includes a
 judge (the List Administrator) and an adjudicator to handle appeals.

<p>
 If someone really annoys you, you can do any of the following:

<OL>
  <li>  Nothing - give no response
  <li>  Respond OFF the list
  <li>  Make a formal complaint to me asking for a judgment against Person X


</OL>
<p>
 5f) What if you just have to respond to "up hold your honor" or to set 
 the "facts/record straight," or to tell the entire list why you
 will not be speaking or reading posts or messages from the person who
 offended you?

<p>
 D O N ' T!

<p>
 we consider such responses flames in their own right and you would
 be taking the law into your own hands; you might also be censured or
 removed from the list.

<p>
Remember:
<br>
 Don't contribute to or continue a fight once one has started.
 doing so places you in violation of the list rules. That includes 
 meta communication, which includes posts with an angry tone, or voice.
