<a href="0604.html#0626qlink1">&gt;What I meant was that, psychologically, cryonics feels like arranging</a><br>
<i>&gt;your own funeral. I support using cryonics, I think its a good last</i><br>
<i>&gt;option, but to actually address it in your life must be like arranging</i><br>
<i>&gt;your own burial site.</i><br>

<p>
When I was sick with leukemia, I had plenty of time to sit around and see
what if felt like to plan my own funeral. Having been in that situation, I
can, without a doubt, proclaim that mailing in my suspension agreement felt
_nothing_ at all like that. It felt like I was taking as positive and
proactive a step as possible to ensure my immortality.

<p>
Death is ugly; death is unpleasant; death is a horrible thing. But running
around thinking "it can't happen to me because I'm young and healthly" is
not the solution. Problems must be faced, for only then can they be dealt
with. And if that means truly accepting the fact that one might die no
matter what one does, then that has to be done, because the next step is
doing whatever one can to ensure that death does _not_ happen, and cryonics
is simply one of those steps.
