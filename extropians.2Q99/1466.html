<p>
I agree. However, seti@home at least provides a detailed map of the
<a name="1483qlink1">radio skies. I'd rather wish they'd look for peculiarly white RF
sources but I guess technical difficulties detecting them are 
</a>
prohibitive. The signal strength will be very low, and the signals 
are probably highly directed.

<p>
Well, due to the nature of the links the task must require essentially 
zero communication. Distributing slices of search space where results
take a great long while to compute and collecting the compact results
is a pretty strong constraint.

It doesn't, since it's very nice -- at least the Linux version is. 
It takes 10 MBytes RAM to run though.

<p>
Yes. Huge distributed GAs to find the best mutation function for
mutating machine code and FPGA cells and mapping rules of 3d CA 
spaces. All computationally expensive yet requiring little bandwidth.
