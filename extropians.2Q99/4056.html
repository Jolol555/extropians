Well, anything that a particular person has already seen is likely to seem
like noise to that particular person. Unless you are posting from very
obscure news sources, that means that you'll get this kind of complaint
anytime you make a habit of making this kind of post.

<p>
The best way I've seen of dealing with the problem is to do what Anders
does - collect a group of items that you would now post separately and
combine them into a single post.  That way those who are interested in the
kinds of articles you usually find can still get them, and those who aren't
have far fewer messages to ignore.

<p>
It also helps to add a bit of commentary.  Relaying a couple of sentences of
explanation and/or commentary with each URL makes the whole message much
more useful for everyone.
