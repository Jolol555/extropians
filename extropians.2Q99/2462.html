Have you ever asked yourself any of these questions?

Do I need a will?

Do I need to put our house in joint ownership?
Do I need to incorporate my business?

Do I need to co-sign on a note for a friend?

<p>
Dear Friend,

<p>
Now, Wouldn't It Be Nice To Be Able To Call An Attorney Every Time
You Have Questions--Like These-- And Not Have To Pay $100+ Per Hour
To Do It? Fortunately You Can!!

<p>
Why do you need to talk with attorneys about legal issues like these anyway?
Good question! Because attorneys can evaluate the legal consequences of
important decisions you make at work or at home, so you can conduct better 
business and avoid costly mistakes. Wealthy individuals and large companies 
know the value of legal advice and regularly consult attorneys. Why? Because 
legal advice saves them money in the long run...and they can afford it! 

<p>
UNLIKE BIG COMPANIES, MANY AMERICANS CAN'T ALWAYS AFFORD TO PAY FOR A LEGAL 
CONSULTATION WHENEVER THEY NEED ONE.

<p>
As a result, many people will wait until their legal situation becomes a huge 
mess before they'll even call an attorney-- In the long run, this approach will
cost A LOT more money in legal fees, mental anguish, and lost income.

<p>
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF "IF" YOU'RE GOING TO NEED AN ATTORNEY.
IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF WHEN!
