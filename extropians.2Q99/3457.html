<i>&gt; &gt;Tough restrictions on guns is one thing, but the real problem is IMO</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;right to defend themselves with lethal force, are also very likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;deny them other rights too (like the right to carry non-lethal weapons </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;like mace or stun guns, or even worse, the very right to defend</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;yourself at all when attacked by a criminal -- this is already quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;common where I live). They tend to see civilians as incompetent </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fools who should be treated like little children, which means that </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;politicians will have (even) less respect for the public's opinion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Is it a cooncidence that the Swiss, who own guns freely, also</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have a general referendum (a real one, where the people's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;decision counts), which is about as democratic as one can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;get, while here in Holland for example most politicians are </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;openly repulsed by the very idea of a referendum (and the </i><br>

<i>&gt; guess, is to lay down with throat exposed and hope the attacker goes away,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or that a teacher will see and stop the fight.</i><br>

<i>&gt; powers to defend ourselves and think for ourselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
And instead pass logical, reasonable and rational laws which allow 
nonagressive sane adults to possess the means with which to 
defend themselves while removing long-range deadly force from the 
fists of those most likely to attack others.
