I strongly disagree; if Joe was interested in reducing the level of violence,
then he would listen to what we have to say, rather than insulting us and
calling for banning gun ownership when it's been well-proven not to reduce
violence. If it did, assaults wouldn't be twice as common in Britain as in
America, for example.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="1998qlink2">There's also a question as to how you measure 'violence'. European countries,
for example, love to claim that they're less violent than America, yet tens
of millions of Europeans have been killed in wars this century. Which is
really more violent?</a>

<p>
No. There is, and they don't care. I saw a wonderful TV show a few months
ago supposedly debating whether handguns should be banned in Britain. On
the one side were the reasonable, rational gun owners calmly pointing out 
the irrationality of the disarmers' position, then the presenter himself
stated quite categorically that they didn't care, they wanted to ban guns,
and ban them they were going to do. Wish I'd taped it, as it was the best
example of disarmers' utter hysterical irrationality I've ever seen, at
least before Joe began posting here.
