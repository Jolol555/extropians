The prolog of the story begins in the mid 1800's when a railroad baron by the name
of Howard find himself dying of old age at 45. He wills that his fortune be used to
find the secret of long life, and the executors, being lawyers in the mid-western
US, decided the best way in that day and age was to establish a human breeding
program, where they researched people whose grandparents all lived to a minimum
high age. They then solicited these people, telling them if they married someone on
the list of people they gave them, they would receive x dollars for each child born
of that union. The protagonist of the book, Lazarus Long, was born in 1910, but the
main plot of the book does not begin until the early 22nd century, when he is the
oldest member of the "Howard Families", and is thus the titular leader of that
group.
