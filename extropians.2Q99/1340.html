One way you can do this is by redefining the coordinate system on the
plane.  Map point (x, y) inwards by a factor of sqrt(x^2 + y^2) and you
map the square at unit coordinates into a unit circle.  This defines
a new metric for distance and should make velocities the same in all
directions in a CA model.  You'd then have to choose a CA so that when
rigid macroscopic objects are rotated, they'd automatically change size
appropriately based on this new metric.  It would be complicated but
could be done in theory.  I think this is the kind of work which you'd
have to do to try to show that our universe could be a CA.

<a name="1348qlink1">And by the way, even if the universe can be nicely modelled by a CA,
it wouldn't mean that someone is running it on their computer.  It can
be modelled now by differential equations but that doesn't prove that
there is an analog computer running it somewhere.  The CA model would
just be a new and (hopefully) simpler model of the underlying structure
of the universe.
