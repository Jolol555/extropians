What if you gave the AI online access to a company which built custom
designed hardware, and an unlimited bank account (not all that unlikely -
whoever builds it likely has some fair access to resources). It examines its
own hardware (description kindly given to it by benefactor), redesigns it
and sends the new design to custom hardware company X, and pays (money
donated by same benefactor), new hardware is delivered, installed, AI moved
to new hardware (thanks again benefactor), and the AI continues the process
using the last design as the next step forward (it is now smarter than it
was due to software and hardware enhancements created by its previous dumber
self).

<p>
Slower than software self-modification, granted, but possible.

<p>
If you've got unlimited money, give the AI direct control over a factory
(fully automated? Maybe not, could employ humans) which can implement it's
new hardware designs, then set up the hardware and copy the AI across. If
the construction process is too slow, the AI can turn it's attention to
redesigning the factory to improve things, get the redesigned factory built,
and continue.

<p>
Certainly you could give an intelligent AI it's own corporation, with a
starting bank balance; it could trade to make money, and use the money to
enhance itself + continue trade, raking in more money as it went because it
would be  getting smarter and so getting better at capitalism. It could
employ people to do human type stuff (tricky physical things that monkeys
are better at than robots), but essentially would be independent, and
perhaps could design better robots if it really needed to break the link.

<p>
Abracadabra, Singularity!
