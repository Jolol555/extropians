<p>
Sure.  Get the poor countries to legalize foreign ownership of agricultural 
operations within thier territories.  Then there would be an incentive for 
organizations with capital to invest in modern farms in these areas, and 
there would be no need for any kind of government program.

<p>
Of course, this would also mean a rapid reduction in the number of farmers, 
so they need to have someplace for the displaced workers to get jobs.  Free 
market reforms, anyone?
