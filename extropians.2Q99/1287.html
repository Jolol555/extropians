Well, what citizens can do is examine the way the government spends money.

<p>
All government records besides some are available on request.  The Sunshine laws
on campaign financing are in effect.

<p>
The government spends citizens' money on all kinds of things.

<p>
There is a question about taxes on whether they should be progressive or not.
What that term means is that richer people are taxed more.  A tax should be
neither progressive nor regressive, in terms of basic quality of life and right
to secure a livelihood and capability to have a retirement.

<p>
The tax code has a myriad of conditions and forma that are interrelated with
different economic sectors with much specially determined allocation.

<p>
Rates on quantities should be taxed at the same rate.

<p>
Research and development is the primary driver of growth.

<i>&gt; &gt; At a meeting held in Tulsa the evening of Tuesday, May 4,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Springer distributed a short paragraph people should provide</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to anyone asking them to file State or Federal income tax</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; returns, the paragraph supposedly constructed by an attorney</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in the Department of Justice.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem with this strategy is that it reinforces a right everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; already has.  No one is compelled to file their tax return or sign it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Everyone is "free" to not comply with the Internal Revenue Code.  However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the IRS and the Department of Treasury are empowered to invoke the</i><br>
<i>&gt; provisions of the IRC (including 'late filing' penalties, 'lack of filing'</i><br>
<i>&gt; penalties, 'nonpayment' penalties, and interest on all of these penalties</i><br>
<i>&gt; and on taxes owed).  Additionally, the law allows the IRS to place and</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforce liens against your property in order to collect taxes.  While this</i><br>
<i>&gt; strategy might get you out of contempt charges, it won't stop the IRS from</i><br>
<i>&gt; liquidating your assets.  Just because you aren't required attest to whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; or not you broke the law or to supply evidence that might incriminate you,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that does not eliminate the judicial remedies available to governmental</i><br>
<i>&gt; agencies or insulate you from them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The IRS can determine your tax liability without your help.  If they are so</i><br>
<i>&gt; inclined, they can fund a fairly invasive investigation.  If you work they</i><br>
<i>&gt; have 1099s to track your income.  If you are self-employed, your customers</i><br>
<i>&gt; must also supply 1099s for payments over certain amounts.  If you aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; employed there is no tax liability to avoid in the first place.  If you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; not employed but have tons of bank accounts and securities that pay you</i><br>
<i>&gt; dividends and interest, the IRS receives 1099s for these amounts also.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The most cogent cases I've seen are the ones that attack the government's</i><br>
<i>&gt; authority to assess tax in the first place.  However, the Supreme Court has</i><br>
<i>&gt; discarded this argument in various vicissitudes several times.  The argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; is so inadequate now that it is the grounds for frivolous claims charges.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Finally, this DOJ employee, as well as yourself, should be careful spreading</i><br>
<i>&gt; this "strategy" about since to the extent someone relies on this strategy,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there could be vicarious liability issues for yourself and the DOJ employee.</i><br>
