<p>
You can't notice the absence of something which doesn't leave.  This is the
sum of your self-awareness.  The brain has a host of complicated funcitons,
but to assume the brain possesses consciousness is making the same mistake
as in the dark ages when the heart was believed to hold the soul,  The
opposite is probably more true:  the soul posesses your brain, heart and
body, discarding it when times up, but cohesive and valid.  No one now,
knows how long before birth your soul posesses integrity, or for how long
after death.  In some cases, the identity, the presence of someone's soul
affects the phsyical to communicate fleetingly with someone.

<p>
We should perhaps understand the process of consciosness transference, by
not only understanding and replicating the functions of the human body, and
brain, but of opening our eyes to the real possibility that until we
understand the basis of sentience, we can't expect uploading to fulfill our
hopes that when the brain is moved, the self-awareness goes with it.

<p>
This is like telling someone who has irreversible brain damage that if they
use fetal cells to replace damaged tissue, they are going to "take on"
another un-born identity, and nobody's sure which one will be top dog in
the person's mind.  At one time, it was feared that transplanted tissues
would retain enough of the chemistry at the time of death to transmit
signals to the recipients nervous system.  This is unfounded, and so is the
idea of moving the brain to move the identity.

<p>
Someone should try it with mice, train one to do something until it's
mastered the trick.  Train another to do the opposite trick (ie. to hit one
button out of two for food, and vice-versa).  Switch their little brains
and after they recover (if they recover) have them stimulated the same way
to perform the trick, and see which one does what- or if they just sit
there scratching themselves because stitches are itchy.  (Which would be
expected if the neural responses are limited to bodily function, and not to
conciousness or memory transference.)

technological verve we can toss at it, or until they prove</a> that rats brains
contain memory and self-awareness when transferred,</a> I'm sticking with the
idea of a soul.</a>
