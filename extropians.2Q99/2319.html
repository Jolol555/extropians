<a name="2364qlink1"><a name="2344qlink1"><a name="2326qlink1">Interesting how so many superheroes gained their powers in some kind of
accident that would probably be repeatable.  For example, Peter Parker
was working with nuclear material and there was an accident that
combined him with a spider, right?  Well, couldn't that be reproduced?</a> 
It's a classic serendipitous discovery, like finding out that the mold
growing on your petri dishes kills bacteria.  It should be possible to
figure out the methodology that could make everyone who wanted</a> to be a
SpiderTransHuman.

justification for all the secret identities is?  Why is it so important
that nobody know that Clark Kent is Superman?  Why is this such a
universal feature of superhero myths?</a>

<i>&gt; &gt; Thanks Elizabeth.  This is why I always liked Batman better than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Superman or any of the others: because Batman and his youthful</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ward Robin used only technology.  Neither they, nor their foes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; had supernatural powers.  Just technology.  I always wished Simon</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bar Sinister would win out over Underdog, because Underdog</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; had supernatural powers, whereas Simon used only science and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology.  Too bad he was evil.  {8^D  spike</i><br>
