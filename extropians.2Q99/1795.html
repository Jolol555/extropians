<a name="1797qlink1">Any good engineer knows that it is far easier to work with the forces
involved rather than try to combat them. Opposing natural forces is a
stressful, unstable, temporary thing. This is why free market capitalism
works best, it doesn't try to fight human nature, but it tries to take
advantage of it to fullfill all needs (including altruistic ones).

We are learning with computing that evolved systems are capable of
becoming the most powerful systems ever, far beyond the capabilities of
targeted purposeful design.

Extropy is not anti-evolution, but for enhanced evolution.
