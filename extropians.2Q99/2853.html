It wasn't an insult at all.

&gt; Tell me, do you EVER read your local newspaper?<br>

<p>
Yup. Why?

<p>
If you bother to read what I write, you might notice that we don't get
many people shot over here at all, and as far as I know tasers aren't
allowed into the country.  Lucky us.

<a href="2781.html#2853qlink4">&gt; &gt; This assumes, once again, that people are always rational.</a><br>

<i>&gt; It would be a nice place to live, if you could live in a society of irrational disarmed</i><br>

<i>&gt; that?</i><br>

<p>
Unlikely, but what is the alternative? A society of armed irrational
people? No thanks.

<p>
I'll stick with disarmament until the human race has evolved a bit.
