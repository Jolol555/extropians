<p>
I'd like to clarify the following matters on which I have received
questions or suggestions:

<p>
Q1:  Are you going to keep the rest of us filled in on what's happening?
A1:  I'm thinking of a weekly summary posted to the Extropians list,
perhaps with content summarized, proprietary ideas removed, and names
stripped.  I'll bring it up with the other members once the list is launched.

<p>
Q2:  Do you accept lurkers?
<br>
A2:  There are no "lurkers" or "posters", only Singularitarians.  If
you're trying to bring about the Singularity, and you're interested in
giving help, or receiving help, or just knowing what other people are
doing, you're welcome on the list - even if you don't see any reason to
post for the next five years.  But if you're just curious, then - let's
see if I can express this in English - the additional differential of
{probable help you provide}, between {your being on the list}, and {your
reading the weekly summary}, is outweighed by the differential of {other
Singularitarians' willingness to share proprietary ideas}.

<p>
Q3:  Isn't the correct-spelling requirement a bit anglocentric?
A3:  A member is required to be *capable* of spelling correctly, but not
necessarily in English - we will certainly excuse non-native speakers
who are kind enough to translate for us.  The secondary reason for the
requirement is that the one's effort of writing saves the many the
effort of reading; for a non-native speaker, the effort required is
incommensurate with the effort saved.  The primary reason for the
requirement is that it provides an easy cluefulness metric, which
obviously doesn't apply to non-native speakers.

<p>
Q4:  Is the list only for rich folks?
<br>
A4:  The list is not "only" for venture capitalists; it is also for
volunteers, writers, students, researchers, advisors, etc.  But the list
*is* intended to be of sufficiently high quality that even people whose
time is valuable will be able to read it.
