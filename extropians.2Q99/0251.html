This really doesn't seem that different from a hundred other arguments
for state intervention.  What if some poor fools fail to repair their cars 
and accidents result?  Clearly the state needs to run car repair.  What if 
people fail to go to the doctor and spread a contagious disease?  Clearly 
the state needs to run medicine.  And so on.

<a name="0267qlink1">You may be confusing a minimalist state with a state that makes everyone 
else adhere to exactly the laws you personally prefer.  The state you 
live in now only has very limited ways you can sue a doctor who did you 
harm.  A minimalist state might not improve on this, and might well allow 
organ sales or even slavery.</a>

<p>
You can't have it both ways.  If complexity rises very fast, the costs of 
Extropians and Christian Scientists choosing substantially different laws 
will be prohibitive, and so they will choose the same law.  If the costs 
are not prohibitive, then some people will be willing to pay the cost, and
benefit as a result.
