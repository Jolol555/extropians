<a name="2609qlink1">I've been reading Eliezer's "Coding a Transhuman AI" page (I'm sure most
people know of it, but here's the URL anyway:
<p>
	<a href="http://singularity.posthuman.com/AI_design.temp.html">http://singularity.posthuman.com/AI_design.temp.html</a>
). Actually, that URL looks a bit weird - is there a more correct one?</a>


<p>
<a name="2609qlink2">Eliezer, I've got a couple of questions:


</a>
<OL>
  <li>  Have you started trying to build this beast? If so, how's it going?

<a name="2609qlink3">  <li>  I haven't seen anything about the environment that you'd want to
"run" such an AI in (maybe I haven't looked hard enough, but its a
damned big document!). Would you give it an artificial, simplistic
environment (simulate some simple, maybe 2d space, with some stuff to
interact with), or are you thinking that full 3d (2.5d?) vision, natural
language, etc... chuck it in the deep end is the way to go?</a>

<a name="2609qlink4">  <li>  Do you have some more info on this?</a>


</OL>
<p>
<a name="2609qlink5">After decades of effort, and due mainly to the intervention of the late
David Marr, we now have a relatively good computer model of human
vision, and specifically of the transition from 2-D pixels to 3-D model.
Some of the algorithms thus invented were later found to correspond to
neural computation, so we know we're on the right track. The intervening
layers are not chaotic, they are not stochastic, and they are not
high-level semantic; they are what Marr called a "2 1/2-D" world, a
series of ordered extractions of increasingly high-level features, using
a lot of computer code.
