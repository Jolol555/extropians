<a href="4551.html#4593qlink1">&lt;&lt; Wow -- this is the first time I've *ever* heard this sentiment</a><br>
 expressed by anyone but myself.  I must admit that I am stupified
 that more men don't feel this way.  I don't think I'm all that
 unusual in terms of the degree or intensity of my sex drive, but
 I find it extremely annoying.  It feels like I'm "trapped in the
 body of an ape".  &gt;&gt;

<a name="4602qlink1">I constantly go between being quite happy that I'm a 21 year old male that 
can't get sex off his mind and being terribly frustrated that I'm a 21 year 
old male that can;t think about anything but sex for more than 1 minute at a 
time. I often stop talking in the middle of a sentence when I pretty girl 
catches my eye. This gets annoying over time.</a>

<p>
Now, I like sex, don't get me wrong. Its just that there is another force at 
work here that takes control of my mind whenever it so chooses (and it so 
chooses frequently).

<a name="4604qlink1">My friend and I have spent the greater part of 4 years commenting on and 
discussing this affliction. We have no advice to offer, yet. But this is a 
problem which I would be happy to see solved.
