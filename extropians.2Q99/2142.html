reasonable people wanna keep 'em outta the hands of those 
statistically most likely to misuse them (violent criminals, the 
mentally deficient and/or deranged, spouse and/or child abusers, 
children).  This is a proactive rather than reactive stance.  Your 
armed guard certainly didn't work as NRA advertized in Littleton.  
Cold hard fact.  Deal with it.

And your armed guard didn't work in Littleton, but you don't like to 
mention that.  Ya wanna keep a hundred in every school?  Who're 
they supposed to hire?  Unemployed NRA members (shudder!)? 
And who'll pay?  The taxpayer again?

<i>&gt; Joe, these kids had bombs. Big fucking bombs. Bombs reportedly big enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; to blow up half the school if they'd been set off. Had they had no guns,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then they would have set those bombs off, and far more kids would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; died.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
They couldn't get them to go off.  Technical difficulties, I understand.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2103.html#2142qlink4">&gt; Bombs, incidentally, have been illegal for quite a while, as far as I'm</a><br>
<i>&gt; aware. So much for laws, eh?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
It takes no technique to pull a trigger (though some to aim 
properly), but a good amount to obtain the necessary materials and 
to properly construct and detonate a bomb.  I'd just as soon make 
them do it the hard way and have many more of them fail, 
thankyouverymuch!  At least make it as hard for them to get the 
guns as it is to get the bombmaking materials; guns are relatively 
hard to make, so if they can't get readymade ones, they're stuck.
