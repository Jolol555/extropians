     Well, one must consider although we now have achieved success 
pushing atoms around using SPM's, (ie. IBM's xenon atoms) we have not 
yet accomplished the feat of creating covalent bonds.(such as nature 
does) The closest we have come to this is Nadrian Seemans nanorobotic 
arm, made out of synthetic DNA. Until this point has occurred, an 
assembler will not. 
<p>
     In the meantime, this is the reason we are exposed to these 
nanoscale evolved technology. The more we create application's on the 
molecular scale, we find more windows of opprotunity for advances. 
There will most likely be in the near future, nanoscale resistors 
(Mitre corp.) and nanochips, quantum dots, nanowires etc. This is 
part of the process to getting to the big picture, and nanomachine 
(manipulator, replicator).
<p>
     There are zillions of similar potential applications on the 
nanoscale. We will first see, paint on watches, retractable doors and 
floors, flat wall sized thin 3D tv's (holography), cars with total 
saftey measures, virtual reality games, doggy dung cleaners, hobbies 
such as railroad nanoscale models, refabrication of clothing, arrays 
anyways, I could go on, but these are the early applications of nano. 
<p>
     Nanomachines are composed of simple, nested geodesic skeletons 
and extensible rods, with no more computing power than today's 
personal computers. Not to tremendous a task to design machines with 
nanometer-scale components, but how do we construct them?
<p>
     "One at a time". We can manipulate atoms at the nanometer scale 
and build more complex machinery at the micron scale. (e.g. computer 
chips) Given the pace of technological development, we will see 
machines of this complexity built by hand soon. But to be useful, we 
will need trillions of them- one trillion would fill a single cubic 
centimeter. Shortly after the first is built, they will be 
manufactured in quanity.
<p>
     If a factory has ten million assemblers (that has taken years to 
create) each capable of producing ten thousand machines a day, it 
will take two weeks to produce a cubic centimeter of finished goods. 
During this period, nanomachine based products will be rare and 
expensive.
<p>
     Eventually replicators will produce assemblers, which will then 
produce nanomachines for final use. This will be in constrained 
environments and will last for some time. Consumers at this time, 
will not have access to replicator technology, but will be a time 
filled with easily accessible nanomachinery. We may also use genetic 
engineering to in fact "rip off" the nanomachinery of living 
organisms to make nanomachines. This would lead to serious 
restrictions however. (depending) 
<p>
     Also involved in the construction of such a machine, is energy 
source-(most limiting aspect-nanomachines can be energy thirsty), 
communication-(machine parts able to interact with eachother and 
follow their commands), processing power-(each machine needs storage 
and computing facilities- 1,000times the computing power of today's 
personal computer), shape-(ie -buckyball or other micron-scale 
geodesic structure) and scale.

<a href="0426.html#0436qlink1">&gt;One thing I haven't noticed with nanotech research is that nobody </a><br>
has yet developed a normal scale universal assembler, not to mention 
one that can replicate itself. From what I've seen, all nanotech 
companies are trying to build the final generation at the nanoscale 
first, which seems awfully bassackwards to me. Thats tantamount to 
having an R&amp;D project during WWII to build a Pentium III chip. I say 
build a human scale assembler, that you can program to create any 
item wanted (especially items larger than itself), and then develop 
an assembler that can not only do that but replicate itself. Once 
this is achieved, work on making successive generations smaller until 
you get to the nano scale.
