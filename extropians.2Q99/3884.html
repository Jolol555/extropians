<a href="3821.html#3884qlink1">&gt;Are electric eels immune to shocks from each other???</a><br>

<p>
Good question...

<p>
There isn't alot of good material on the www about this, so I'll
have to make a library stop to check. It would seem that if they
are immune (insulated) from their own attack, they would be from
each other. Maybe they simply recognise each other and refrain.

<p>
Electric eels (not a true eel) can generate as much as 500 volts at
2 amps, as they grow, the amp's increase but not the voltage.

<p>
The March 96' issue of IEEE spectrum had an article on this, there
are over 500 marine creatures with electrical "potential". Most
apparently use it for forms of detection.

<p>
A transhuman electrical organ could have a number of use's,
including powering internal devices.
