<a href="3054.html#3274qlink1">&gt;Try to keep the gun debate in those topics labelled such, or change the</a><br>

Picky picky, gee, CAPS only? Beginning of the title line,? Anyway, I was 
trying to shift it AWAY from the G word!! : )

To reply to you very well thought-out post:
This is the kind of thing that technology, psychology, smart drugs, whatever 
means we use, we need to begin to address. It is often discussed that if 
people's ethical "goodness" was as quick to progress as our chips progress 
(what is it-doubling every four months- we'd all be perfect by now. For 
whatever reason, 
<br>
humanity clings rather hard to it's anger and it's violence. It is FUN, I 
guess.
<br>
Once you begin to experience yelling, letting off steam, or whatever, it 
empowers the senses. Not just talking about, but raging in fury:  a feeling 
of tightening arteries, adrenilin rushes, and blood pressure elevation, must 
feel GOOD to some people. People love such an excuse to lose control. It 
feels like a "healthy venting" of emotion. Lately Psychology has theories 
that there is no such thing.

<p>
Actually, medicine has found that it increases heart disease. It can shorten 
your life! It begets more anger, not a release. People who punch pillows or 
punching bags only become more angry!! Just as sensuality leads to more 
sensuality, anger leads to more anger!!
<br>
And other emotions do not incur a fight of course. - BUT as Hal pointed out 
(well, I am misquoting horribly) it's the one that let us heave intruders out 
of our cave. 

<p>
It is not only a state of mind, it is a physical agitiation, detrimental to 
our nervous system and to other's health,to boot! 
Um.. how do we change that primal need? Is it a spiral we are stuck in 
forever?In Transhumism it is expected we will overcome things that hinder us.
Augmented refined emotions? How to get that?

<p>
Some suggestions might be learning better Emotional IQ, better communication 
skills, prozac (just kidding; - ), a better alignment with reality, and  
practice... practice.. practice...
