<p>
As it turns out, the 3rd Amendment *has* been enforced in recent years.  The 
case involved Nat'l Guard troops being housed in the on-site dorms of 
striking prison guards.  For details about that and just about anything else 
pertaining to the 3rd Amendment, see Tom W. Bell, "The Third Amendment: 
Forgotten but Not Gone," 2 William &amp; Mary Bill of Rights J. 117 (1993), 
available at &lt;<a href="http://members.aol.com/tomwbell/papers/3rd.html">http://members.aol.com/tomwbell/papers/3rd.html</a>&gt;.

It turns out (*snort*) that Prof. Bell is slated to speak at Extro4!  Patent 
law or some such thing.  Query where Max finds these people.
