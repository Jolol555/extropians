&gt;  Sure, if everybody is using (say) bacillus thuringensis-based
&gt; gm crops, then the evolutionary pressure for resistant pests will be
&gt; very high and we can count on them appearing - parasitic relationships
&gt; force both parts into a co-evolutionary spiral, and we humans better
&gt; be a part of it for the species we like.

</pre>
<p>
What about the species we dont like ?
<br>
If a species natural parasites can no longer successfully feed off it,
they will adapt in 2 ways - 1 to overcome the gm plants defeneses and 2
into any other ecological niches they can.
This will lead to a spiral of new gm crops and new parasites (which is
fine if our labs can keep up) - but there will also be a spill over of
the new resistant parasites onto plants which are not genetically
modified.  How do you protect the wild plants in this scenario ?


<p>
&gt;  It is likely better to have several different forms of pest
resistance, so that no 
<br>
&gt; single resistant pest can take out all the plants and the pressure
towards resistance &gt; will be weakened. How to promote this diversity
economically is an interesting 
<br>
&gt; extropian question.

<p>
Agreed.  This would help a lot, but I'm not sure that commercial
companies would be so willing to promote the necessary diversity.

<p>
On a related topic the EU looks to be moving to ban antibiotics in
animal feed and sprayed onto fruit for similar reasons.
