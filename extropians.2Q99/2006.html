<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Victim disarmament is neither rational nor reasonable, and almost every </i><br>
<i>&gt; country which has imposed registration of guns (and background checks are</i><br>
<i>&gt; registration by default) has gone on to ban and confiscate many or most </i><br>
<i>&gt; of those registered guns. Most gun owners are reasonable people, and have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been willing to accept 'reasonable' infringements on their rights... and</i><br>
<i>&gt; you know what? The disarmers continually come back with just one more</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'reasonable' infringement to add to the list until all rights are gone;</i><br>
<i>&gt; their desire to completely ban private ownership of guns is hardly a</i><br>
<i>&gt; secret. This will only stop when gun owners stand up and stop being</i><br>

<i>&gt; Ok Joe, since you're the Constitutional expert, you explain just what</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'general welfare' means in the context it's used in the Constitution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="2100qlink6">"Promote the general welfare" basically means to maximize the
