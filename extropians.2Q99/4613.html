<a name="4628qlink1"><a name="4616qlink1">Here's an interesting new filtering variant we've cooked up with 
Cris Rasch today.

<p>
To recapitulate: my original proposal was to establish a pair of
lists: extropians moderated/unmoderated. Everything rejected from
extropians moderated would go to extropians unmoderated that anybody
who subscribed to both lists would get the full feed, if so inclined. 

<p>
This scheme is simple to implement, but has obvious flaws. To avoid
pressing anybody in a single quality metric it should be possible to
associate each subscriber with a ranking matrix against the other
participants (which could be inquirable remotely). With 1 k subscribers
this means keeping track of 1 M short integers, which is tolerable
nowadays (besides, this can be implemented as sparse matrix). Each 
mail will be attached a pair of urls/listserv commands to 
increment/decrement your individual ranking of the poster this mail 
came from. The matrix gets initialized with zero. All positive</a> values
including zero mean no filtering. -1 means every second post gets 
through, -2 every third, etc. 
</a>
<p>
<a name="4616qlink2">This doesn't include topic filtering, but this can be addressed
separately. To address this, we can agree on an initial keyword pool
(META:SPACE:GUNS: etc.) and make the listserv let through only
properly classified messages. If a message is unclassified it gets
send back with a list of current keywords. There should be a mechanism 
of creating new keywords, and discarding obsolete ones (e.g. by aging).

<p>
I'm fairly certain it would be possible to hack mailman into
supporting this. Does anybody see any obvious flaws in the scheme?
