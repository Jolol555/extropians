Mike, the thing that concerns me more than this is the notion that
if some of us achieve immortality (or greatly extended lifespans)
through extreme effort, cost and discipline, that we would be targeted
by those who choose short lifespans.  Look around you: most people
choose to shorten their own lives in one way or another.  I ride
motorcycles, way too quickly, for instance.  In general, people
eat terribly unhealthfully, drink way too much, *smoke* tobacco still,
among other life shortening habits.  I could easily see how some
misguided, deliberately short lived person would see an immortal
as a threat to mother earth, or some such foolishness, and would
try to identify and kill us.  spike
