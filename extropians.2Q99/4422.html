<i>&gt;&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;7F00,0000,0000&lt;/param&gt;&gt; I came out a Shepherd. Which IS consistent with the INTJ ("Mastermind"</i><br>

<p>
&lt;/color&gt;&lt;smaller&gt;&gt;&gt; on <a href="http://keirsey.com">http://keirsey.com</a>) What am I supposed to make of that? Anyone else

<p>
<a href="4378.html#4422qlink1">&gt;&gt; compared their medieval "type" to their Myers-Briggs type?</a><br>


<p>
&lt;bigger&gt;&gt;That would seem to be evidence that they are at least somewhat

<p>
<a href="4382.html#4422qlink2">&gt;independent, as I am consistently INTJ, but came out "discoverer"</a><br>

<p>
<a href="4382.html#4422qlink3">&gt;here (as did most of us, I suspect).</a><br>


<p>
While I was taking the quiz (ONCE only, Rob -- SHEESH), it seemed to me 
that my answers were So Quintessentially Extropian that most of us would 
likely land in the same category (Prime Minister). That is clearly not 
the case, and of course I am glad of that. We know what lack of 
variation does to a population ...


<p>
These tests are psycho-quackery, IMnsHO, without 
experimental/experiential validation. Or did I miss the bibliography on 
the Kingdomality site? Fortunately, I also seem to have missed the sales 
pitch, so I don't really know why they are doing it. If it's just a 
cyber-parlor game, that's fine, but the verbiage about fitting

<p>
(pseudo-)Medieval characters (actually, they sound more Renaissance to 
me) into the corporate world would seem to imply otherwise. 


<p>
The other thing I didn't see is a list of their types and descriptions, 
so I don't know if I should take the test again and try to be someone 
else :-)


<p>
Time permitting, I'll go do the M-B again for comparison, but that's 
really their job.
