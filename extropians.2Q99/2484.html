<a name="2562qlink1">Yeah I think it's interesting because if you did pay people
for rights to their ideas (just like movie studios pay writers
for their scripts), then very quickly you might end up with
a bunch of people (just think about how many screenplay writers
are out there) just coming up with all kinds of ideas (of course
most of them are crap) in order to make money. So it might
stimulate ideas in general.

<p>
Can you point me to these "umbrella companies" you say are
already doing this? I can think of stuff like IdeaLab that
incubate startups, but it really doesn't go to quite the
extreme I am describing.
