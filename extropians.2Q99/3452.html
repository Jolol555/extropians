No, I think standard says what it is.  The limited federal laws I have 
proposed should be nationally adopted and the differences between 
states or municipalities which exceed those should not stand 
(judicially ensuring this would be a proper use of the 2nd 
amendment).

<p>
Not at all; such an internal sectioning of our country would be both 
restrictive and cumbersome, and I oppose it.
