<p>
yes, the only activities which are at lower risk are civil aviation, getting

While some people I know think that its the soccer mom who will bring about the
end of our constitutional democracy, I just think they will turn the entire
country into the rubber room they want their kids to grow up in and never leave.
How about Mothers Against Teaching Children How to Get Out from Under Their
Skirts.</a></a>
