Scientists Grapple With Germ Danger

<p>
SEATTLE (AP) -- It sounds like science fiction: Microscopic oil droplets 
protect patients from germs and viruses by fusing with the dangerous bugs and 
causing them essentially to explode.

<p>
University of Michigan scientists, hunting ways to protect soldiers from 
biological warfare, say they have created just such a drug. It can eradicate 
deadly anthrax within an hour of contact, and promises to be so non-toxic to 
humans that one day it might be possible to decontaminate germ-laden food.

<p>
Dr. James Baker, creator of these drug droplets so tiny they have been dubbed 
``nano-bombs,'' added some to a sample of cholera viewed through a microscope.

<p>
A few minutes later, ``All that's left here is debris. The remarkable thing 
is this happens almost immediately,'' Baker said.

<p>
While still highly experimental, Baker told a biotechnology meeting here 
Wednesday he envisions one day using the nano-bombs not just to treat 
infection, but as protection. They might work as an HIV-blocking vaginal 
cream. Or spray them in your nostrils during flu season and you might not get 
sick.

<p>
Baker mixed them to the consistency of skim milk and put them in a standard 
paint sprayer as a way to decontaminate the environment after, say, an 
anthrax threat.

<p>
If you add peppermint, he said, ``it actually tastes pretty good.''

<p>
Baker's creation is part of a Star Trek-like field of science called 
``nanotechnology,'' creating drugs and other products so minute that 
researchers have to build them one molecule at a time.

<p>
<a name="1757qlink2">Such discoveries have so intrigued the Clinton administration that it just 
listed nanotechnology as a research priority for the next budget, said 
Gregory Milman, director of the National Institutes of Health's Office</a> for 
Innovation.

<p>
Joining nanodrugs on the wish list are computer chips capable of storing 
trillions of bits of information on a pin-head and miniature sensors that 
could detect hidden ovarian cancer.

<p>
Also Wednesday, researchers said they are designing nanochips to quickly read 
a patient's genes to help pinpoint medical treatment, and ``nanoswitches'' to 
turn off defective genes.

<p>
Just how small is nanotechnology? A nanometer is a mere one-billionth of a 
meter. Bacteria and viruses are many times smaller than a human hair, and 
Baker's nano-bombs are hundreds of times smaller than that.

<p>
Size is key because it makes the oil droplets ``likely to fuse with bacteria 
while leaving our own cells alone,'' said Baker, whose Defense 
Department-funded research also is important to doctors hunting ways to fight 
the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

<p>
The droplets bind to the membrane coating germs or viruses and disrupts that 
coating ``so much that the organism literally explodes,'' explained Baker. He 
said he successfully has killed a host of bacteria and viruses -- even HIV, 
anthrax and smallpox -- in test-tube studies.

<p>
Animal tests showed success, too.

<p>
Spraying the wounds of mice dying of anthrax reduced mortality by 85 percent. 
Nano-bombs decontaminated environmental anthrax faster than bleach, one of 
just a few chemicals strong enough to kill the spores on contact.

<p>
That is important considering growing fear over use of this deadly infection 
by bioterrorists. The nation had 5,000 anthrax threats last year, Baker said.

<p>
When people are thought to be exposed, they may be washed down with bleach or 
given antibiotics in an attempt to stave off infection, but doctors -- and 
the Defense Department, worried about biowarfare -- want better protection.

<p>
When Baker tried to infect mice with a severe flu strain, those whose noses 
first had been swabbed with the nano-bombs did not get sick. Unprotected mice 
died.

<p>
Why would not nano-bombs hurt our cells, too? Most human cells have a 
different coating that seems to keep them from fusing with the droplets, 
Baker said. So far, animals have not shown any sign of harm. But he will have 
to prove safety in lengthy clinical trials before Americans could use such a 
drug.

<p>
Baker's first goal is to use nano-bombs as an environmental decontamination 
agent because that takes less testing than the Food and Drug Administration 
requires for a medication.

<p>
But his first human drug study, to be conducted at NIH, is planned: using 
nano-bombs as a vaginal cream to try to protect women from the AIDS virus and 
other sexually transmitted diseases.
