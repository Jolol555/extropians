<a name="1032qlink1">Actually, IMO there is a simple, non-technological reason why videophones
will not emerge in the consumer market anytime soon: we don't want them.
I'm not interested, no matter how cheap it is, and neither is anyone else
that I know - and that includes a lot of techno-gadget addicts.</a>

Businesses will want videophones for all sorts of good reasons - and they
already have them, and the prices are falling just like you predict.
Residential use will have to wait for a generation that doesn't mind
answering the thing in a bathrobe, or (more likely) for an image-editing AI
good enough that people won't be worrying about what they look like.
