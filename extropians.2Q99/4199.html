<a name="4202qlink2">One can imagine a world of zombies, [philosopher David Chalmers]  asserts,
just like ours but *lacking* consciousness.  The brains of these zombies
mimic ours precisely, but there's no light on inside.  They act and speak
and laugh and `love', but are mere automatons.  Since this nightmare is
logically possible, Chalmers says, consciousness must be something over and
above mere neural structure in action.</a>

<a name="4202qlink3">What is it, then?  Information, he concludes.  Not an answer to give the
faithful any comfort, admittedly.  Chalmers believes a complex artificial
intelligence system would be conscious.  So he is not proposing to
reinstate an immaterial soul.  He puts it neatly: `Experience is
information from the inside; physics is information from the outside.'
Inside what, though?  Inside the mind, with the qualia.  But that leaves us
<a name="4202qlink4">where we came in.  Besides, I would argue that we cannot truly imagine a
</a>
zombie world, any more than we can truly imagine a world exactly like ours,
full of jittering molecules but without heat.  Stewart and Cohen provide an
amusing analogy to support this suspicion.  Imagine a *zombike*, they
suggest, `which is *exactly like a bicycle in every way* except that it
does not move when the pedals are pushed. Oh, mystic miracle of ineffable
immateriality, the source of motion in a bicycle is not anything
physical!'29  The zombie analogy, at root, is no more persuasive nor even
intelligible.
