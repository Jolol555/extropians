<p>
Me too.  Obviously a device built out of degenerate matter, in the shape of
a shell covering the surface of a white dwarf, would provide much better
performance in a far smaller volume of space (although the mass required is
larger by a factor of a few thousand).  Come on, guys, lets see some
imagination!</a>  ;-)

<p>
Well, that's what Solar System-sized 'body' surrounding that brain is for -
a couple of solar masses worth of Dyson sphere, defense satellites and
warships will do wonders for your survivability.  Besides, you can't do much
damage to something that big with a puny little energy source like nuclear
fusion - you need a real weapon, like quantum black holes with a
carefully-timed evaporation period.

<p>
Well, that's the problem with 'small is beautiful".  I'll stick with big
guns, thick armor, and lots of empty space around me.

<p>
Of course, this is all academic anyway.  By the time it is remotely possible
to actually do anything like this, we'll have much better ideas.
