Well, it can't get quite that bad.  Any reasonably frugal person can save up
enough to fund their own retirement in less than 100 years - often much
less, especially in high-paying fields.  You could also do a partially
retirement - work hard for 20 years, then switch to a part-time job and use
the interest on your savings to make up the difference.

<a name="0684qlink1">Immortality would give everyone a chance to let compound interest turn their
pennies into dollars, and their dollars into riches.  Of course, if it
becomes common for people to retire and live off their interest the economy
is going to start looking pretty strange.
