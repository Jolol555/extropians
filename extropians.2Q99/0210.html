<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If Harold Schwartz, accountant from St. Paul, was sufficiently inspiring in his college speeches to get earnest young university volunteers to work for his election, sufficiently politically adept to get a third party nomination and wangle that status and his grassroots-cultivated support into participation in the debates, and sufficiently articulate and reasonable sounding to win them (many eventual voters watch them regardless of the number of participants), you'd be calling him Gov. Harold Schwartz.</i><br>

You are really living in la la land aren't you? If you don't have a name with preexisting brand recognition in a large percentage of the people's mind, then you aren't going to get a party nomination of any kind. No party wants to back a no name loser, having a celebrity status of some kind gets you automatic free publicity with the media. If you aren't a celebrity already, you'd better have a long record of other public exposure, either as a journalist, a state bureaucrat, a big business owner, etc. Even Jesse Ventura had to have served as  Mayor of his hometown first to gain credibility. Sonny Bono was likewise a Mayor before he ran for congress (and a congressional district is much easier to campaign in than a whole state). Ronald Reagan got elected as governor of California based on his acting career. The only other position he held before that was as president of the Actors Guild. Any experienced politician will tell you, if you haven't got a NAME, you ain't got s***.
