<a name="0055qlink1">Hardly. Quite the opposite in fact, since Storekeeper Joe would have his own tank, mortar and machine gun emplacements if he so chose to, or he had an insurance policy with a security agency which did so. People are the most polite and respectful of
property when there are arms present. This is vouched for the high levels of property crime in europe and us cities compared to rural areas.</a>
