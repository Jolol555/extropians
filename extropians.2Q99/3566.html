<a href="3534.html#3566qlink1">&gt; As Max indicated, he and I as the managing officers of Extropy Institute (the </a><br>
<i>&gt; sponsoring organization for this list) believe that some action is necessary </i><br>
<i>&gt; to address questions of list content that have arisen here in the last few </i><br>
<i>&gt; weeks.  I will be communicating soon with Eugene about his kind offer of </i><br>
<i>&gt; acting as list moderator and we may well take him up on that proposition in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the near future.  In the meantime, we are taking some rough-and-ready action </i><br>
<i>&gt; to restore balance to the content of the list.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="3577qlink1">I do have a substantial problem with Eugene's bias in favor of pro-
gunners, which could constitute a cynical and self-serving reason 
for his volunteering as list moderator;</a> he has contacted me 
privately asking me to cease refuting their canardic screeds (but so 
far as I know has not requested them to refrain from issuing them), 
has said that he would killfile me (but not them), and has generally 
expressed sympathy with their wild west position.   I shall be 
<a name="3607qlink1">closely perusing his handling of this matter and shall not</a> hesitate 
to cry "foul" should I detect the least scintilla of slack or favoritism 
for either position over the other.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3534.html#3566qlink2">&gt;              PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY:</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As a temporary measure in response to the extreme number of postings that </i><br>
<i>&gt; have been generated by a small number of posters on a single topic, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; subject of "guns" will be considered off-topic for the list for a period of </i><br>
<i>&gt; two weeks beginning on Saturday, June 12, 1999 at 12:01 am PST.  Again as a </i><br>
<i>&gt; temporary measure, any posters continuing existing "gun" threads, starting </i><br>
<i>&gt; new ones or raising the subject of "guns" in existing threads<a name="3567qlink1"> during this </i><br>
<i>&gt; two-week period will be unsubscribed from the list for a period</a> of three </i><br>
<i>&gt; months.  Please note that this prohibition will go into effect in a little </i><br>
<i>&gt; over 24 hours.  Accordingly, there is plenty of time to draft a civil, </i><br>
<i>&gt; reasoned summation of whatever views any subscriber may wish to express and </i><br>
<i>&gt; post them to the list.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because this is a temporary measure intended to restore balance and civility </i><br>
<i>&gt; to the list, I will be the sole judge of whether a post during the period is </i><br>
<i>&gt; in violation of the prohibition on posts concerning "guns".  If you have any </i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt regarding whether a message you are considering posting to the list may </i><br>
<i>&gt; be in violation of this temporary prohibition, it probably is: Hold your </i><br>
<i>&gt; breath, count to ten and let whatever you have to say wait until we work out </i><br>
<i>&gt; some way to accommodate this discussion in a way that does not flood the </i><br>
<i>&gt; list.  Substituting discussion of some weapon other than a hand-held </i><br>
<i>&gt; chemically-powered projectile device for "gun" will not make a post </i><br>
<i>&gt; acceptable during this brief cooling-off period.  Everyone with enough </i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence and emotional maturity to be a welcome poster to this list </i><br>
<i>&gt; should know what subjects will be considered temporarily off-topic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This action should not be interpreted as a "victory" or a "defeat" for the </i><br>
<i>&gt; substance of any position that has been espoused in the "gun debate" here, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but is undertaken with great reluctance as a measure to impose the minimum of </i><br>
<i>&gt; decorum and editorial judgment on a topic that has grown to become a </i><br>
<i>&gt; disproportionate part of the volume of this list's content.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Finally, a personal note.  I regret that this temporary action is necessary, </i><br>
<i>&gt; do not relish whatever controversy it may cause and sincerely hope that this </i><br>
<i>&gt; episode will not establish any precedent for future list governance.  (Those </i><br>
<i>&gt; familiar with Roman history should consider the figure of Cincinatus as the </i><br>
<i>&gt; only guide to which I will look in this brief interlude.) </i><br>
