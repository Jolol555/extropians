<a href="1999.html#2068qlink1">&gt; Most people who claim they have a gun for personal protection have very</a><br>
<i>&gt; little need for that claim. Unless you work for the government or some other</i><br>
<i>&gt; agency that MAY put your life at risk or threat then chances are you have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; need for a gun.  But what about home security?  Bullshit! Guns can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; expensive not to mention the ammo ... why not spend that money in investing</i><br>
<i>&gt; in better alarm systems and top quality locks for your home and windows?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Invest your money in a silent alarm connected with the local police</i><br>
<i>&gt; department. But ohh no, that would take away the fun of blasting the gun toy</i><br>
<i>&gt; at an intruder ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If freedom comes at the cost of the lives of dozens of kids every month,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then screw it, I support the government and the security agencies that are</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to restrict such a free flowing gun-ridden society. New gun laws does</i><br>
<i>&gt; not mean violation of rights (that were written when the earth was still</i><br>
<i>&gt; cooling) or is against freedom, its against unnecessary death and reduction</i><br>
<i>&gt; of terrorism.  True, criminals could still get hold of guns, but the last 10</i><br>
<i>&gt; incidents at schools usually involved guns from normal households, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegally through the black market.</i><br>

I would recommend that you actually examine some of the evidence compiled by
Professor Lott.  If you see that your precepts are inaccurate, perhaps you will
change them.
