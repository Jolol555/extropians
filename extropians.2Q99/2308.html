It would require little creativity to make a non-fertile "female
version" of your genes.  Certain genetic pecularities block 
masculinization during fetal development and produce XY females 
who are relatively normal except for some reproductive tract defects 
which are not visible.  They are, however, sterile.

<p>
Theoretically they could make a female version of you by doubling
the X chromosome although we haven't yet shown this works in people.
It is possible you'd get problems although unlikely.
Fruit fly females homozygous for the X chromosome are pretty normal.

<p>
There are some developmental issues with egg vs. sperm source of
genes which may or may not need to be resolved.
