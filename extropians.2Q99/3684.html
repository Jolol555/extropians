Exclusive: Analyzer Founds Computer Security Start-Up
By Ronny Lifschitz


<p>
Ehud Tenenbaum, known as the "Analyzer", still awaiting the commencement of
hearings in his trial, following the exposure of his penetration of the
Pentagon’s computers, is forming a computer security company. Tenenbaum’s
partners are three students currently completing their studies in electronic
engineering. The new company is negotiating with potential investors, and
plans to raise $4.5-5 million for the purpose of developing a security
software package, that will be able to monitor hackers’ activities.

<p>
The other partners are Sharon Shani, Gil Bar-Noy, who was chairman of the
students’ negotiating team in the tuition fee battle with the government,
and another student, who prefers to remain anonymous. At the beginning of
1998, the three set up Webber Communications, a company which engaged
primarily in the construction of Internet sites and consultation to Internet
companies.

<p>
"Our idea is very innovative, and is based on the hacker’s point of view",
Tenenbaum explains to "Globes". "Our product will be able to adapt itself to
the hackers’ evolving methods, and upgrade itself". Tenenbaum refused to
give details of the type of security software the company is to develop, but
said that he and his partners, who served with the IDF Intelligence Corps,
will set up an intelligence system to monitor the modus operandi of hackers
the world over, and thus close the gap existing between security companies
and hackers.

<p>
The young entrepreneurs believe that many organisations will purchase their
future product, including NASA and the Pentagon.
