Greetings,

<p>
I saw "Matrix" the other night and totally loved it!!  It was one of 
the best science fiction films that I have ever seen.  I was thrilled 
by the anime style fighting sequences with the incredible leaping and 
wall smashing punches and throws!  Just think, when were all posthuman 
we could have our own sparring tournament with the same powerful moves 
as in the movie!  Hmmm...what would be a good name for it?

<p>
As a boy who grew up without my father because he felt he had better 
things to do; I loved the Obi-One Kenobi style relationship Morpheus 
had with Neo.  Morpheus believed in him and did is best to train him 
for future challenges.

<p>
I have read the various criticisms listed in the digest.  I think that 
if the writers had taken everyone of them into consideration that the 
movie would have lasted only five minutes with the A.I.'s winning 
hands down!!  For the sake of dramatic license and structure you have 
to suspend the element of disbelief.

<p>
I believe that the reason the A.I.'s may have used humans as a power 
source was to simply degrade their former masters.  Couldn't even a 
cybernetic intelligence be insane?  the mind-boggling vista of 
gigantic virus-like machines harvesting human infants from their 
"fields" made the whole audience I saw the film with gasp!

<p>
The reason the A.I.'s may have built the matrix was because there was 
some residual original programming in them to "oversee" the human 
race.  And so they did in their own twisted way.

<p>
This film could be seen on several different levels.  One would be to 
realize how even in the "mundane" world we assume we live in that our 
culture has socialized or perhaps even programmed us to believe and 
act in certain ways.

<p>
Well, these are just some of my thoughts inspired by the film and 
digest comments about it.  Take care everyone!

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
