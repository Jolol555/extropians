Yeah, I wouldn't have taken the LEF bait, except that they had an
abstract of a controlled study from a European journal about Adapton
successfully treating CFS.  There could be all kinds of reasons why that
study is invalid - I have no idea which European journals are reputable,
or I suppose they could even be manufacturing phony abstracts - but it
seemed like a reasonable chance to take, especially when there is so
much leading edge CFS research that no one seems to know about.

<p>
Does anyone else have an opinion about the LEF?  I found their CFS info
to be hit and miss - a few of the things they recommend are promising
leading edge treatments, with prelimary studies confirming their
usefulness.  But they still mention the Epstein-Barr hypothesis, which
was long ago disproven.

<p>
I am also put off by the hype-hype-hype of the language they choose, and
the fact that they sell the products that they write about.  But so far
as I know, no one else is covering the same topics that they are.

<p>
They also offer a number of blood tests without a prescription, which
should warm the heart of any medical anarchist.
