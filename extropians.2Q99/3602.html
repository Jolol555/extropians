She wouldnt need to ovulate.  She would implant frozen embryos
brought from earth, all of which would be genetically unrelated to
each other.

This brings up a notion I have been toying with.  Before this thread
was drowned by gun rancor, we talked about the fact that a single
mama would be unable to train the children right.  It takes a village
and all that, right?  Well, in the case of a new Mars colony, the
traditional rules that humans have evolved for societies simply would
not apply.

Mars, well, why not?  You might be able to imagine several rules
that would no longer apply.  spike
