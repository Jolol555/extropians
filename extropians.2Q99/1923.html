When I was in high school in the 80's, we had a wave phenomenon like this too, only it
was suicide. In one year the incidence of teen age suicide popped up by some huge
factor. The reason is because kids who were in need of help saw how much attention
those kids who tried to kill themselves did, and how much their peers expressed how
much they cared for the students who did kill themselves, and they wanted that
attention too. At some point it got old and everyone said how much of a loser such and
so was to kill themselves, and the wave stopped.

<p>
The homicide wave has been going on all thru the 90's, but up till this year it was
mostly just in minority schools, so it was attributed to gang violence. It is far
harder now for a kid to get a gun than when I was in school. In fact, I took my hunter
safety course at school (they won't offer it anymore). You can't blame it on the guns.
