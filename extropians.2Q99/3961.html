<a href="3958.html#3961qlink1">&gt; This is interesting.  It does not explain why people who are married</a><br>
<i>&gt; or who have girlfriends/boyfriends still commit rape though.</i><br>

<p>
the hypothesis is that this depends on an additional postulate - that males
will have sex with more than 1 partner if given the opportunity. There seems
to be some evidence for this from coolidge to clinton ;-)

<p>
&gt; Nor does<br>
<a href="3958.html#3961qlink2">&gt; it explain why little old ladies sometimes get raped.</a><br>
that is not a problem for the rape hypothesis, but rather for any
reproductive hypothesis - people who have been married for 50 years have
been known to have sex to, I am told ;-)

<p>
<a href="3958.html#3961qlink3">&gt; Wouldn't the</a><br>
<i>&gt; tendancy be for primarily sexually attractive people to get raped if</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is about sex?</i><br>
ceterus paribus, yes. That is a critical case: given the choice of raping an
"attractive" and an "unattractive" person, the attractive person should be
chosen.

<p>
<a href="3958.html#3961qlink4">&gt; How would this explain prostitutes getting raped?  Clearly they</a><br>
<i>&gt; provide easy access to sex, yet there are many cases of prostitutes</i><br>
<i>&gt; being raped.</i><br>
This is a problem for psychopathic behavior. One explanation is that $0.00
is less than $100 and so ...

<p>
<a href="3958.html#3961qlink5">&gt; If you could point me in the direction of the article (or other</a><br>
<i>&gt; source) where you found the information about incidence of rape</i><br>
<i>&gt; decreasing when available sex partners increases I'd be very</i><br>
<i>&gt; interested to read it.</i><br>

<p>
high level but approachable intro at Pinker's book "how the mind works" and
Wright's book The Moral Animal
