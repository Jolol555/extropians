<a href="4552.html#4590qlink1">&gt;     Just recently watched the Matrix (it came out two weeks ago in the UK).</a><br>
<i>&gt; After hearing all the noise about it on this list I was expecting to get a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot out of this film.  I didn't.  As a film, it was awful.  It's concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; style amounts to wearing sunglasses in the dark.  Although many of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; special effects scenes were excellent (when Neo emerges from the pod, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; effective use of still motion to show that Neo has been shot) the directing</i><br>
<i>&gt; was less than seamless, sometimes making the film difficult to watch.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; first half-hour was almost painful as we went through the usual cool-hacker</i><br>
<i>&gt; crazy-friends routine.  At one point, when Morpheous began waxing</i><br>
<i>&gt; philosophical, I lost consciousness.  And then for some inexplicable reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; the submarine/spaceship/whatever had to be attacked by squids.  The whole</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea of a world where you can make things up as you go along is probably one</i><br>
<i>&gt; that should be avoided in future.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     If there were no good scenes and no good ideas in this film it wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been so bad. But there were at least two good scenes and one good idea,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and for that I hate it. The next film to make good use of still motion and</i><br>
<i>&gt; tackle more transhuman problems is going to make less of an impact because</i><br>
<i>&gt; of this.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4594qlink1">Hear, hear! Sure, the excellent special effects and graphic violence 
made the movie *bearable*, but no more than that. The plot is silly 
beyond belief (by anyone's standards), and hardly uses the virtually 
<a name="4594qlink2">unlimited potential of the uploaded reality concept.</a> My gawd, it 
could have been *so much more*, but instead it may have effectively 
ruined the entire genre...
