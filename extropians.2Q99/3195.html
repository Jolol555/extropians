 No, everyone should be able to protect themselves to an extent, and that
 extent needs to be agreed upon and decided.  I don't think lethal
 technology is a good idea.  You do. I fail to see how your opinion makes
 things suddenly objectively true, unless you are god or some other
 higher power. &gt;&gt;

I fail to see how your opinion makes things suddenly objectively true. I fail 
to see how a democratic vote would make anyone's opinion suddenly and 
objectively true. And I don't believe in god(s).

as the person who would be dead. Every person must be free to defend their 
life. If your neighbors possession of gun(s) bothers you, then perhaps you 
ought to *get over it*. I'm not willing to let myself be killed, stolen from,
