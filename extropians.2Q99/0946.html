<p>
I've come to believe that remotely operated and autonomous military vehicles 
<br>
(or RCCVs as Igor Mendelev calls them) will be THE most important military <br>
technology of the first quarter of the 21st century.  We're already seeing 
significant impact from such technology in aerial warfare in the form of 
cruise missiles and small, inexpensive remotely operated reconnaissance 
aircraft.  Right now remotely operated/semi-autonomous, reusable jet combat 
vehicles are under development by the U.S. for deployment in the 2005-2010 
time period.  The U.S. armed services are already working on developing 
tactics for these machines and the folks involved in that process talk about 
a real revolution in the effectiveness of air power once these systems are 
deployed.

<p>
Igor's right that the biggest breakthrough will come when this sort of 
technology begins to be developed for ground combat.  However, the problems 
are very great -- much more so than for aircraft.  Igor's proposed design for 
an RCCV highlights the two key problems: Mobility and supply.  The vehicle he 
describes looks to be about the size of a mid-range automobile with mobility 
a little greater than a current-generation light SUV.  

<p>
Imagine the offensive and defensive tactics such a vehicle would call for.  
Within its range, on roadways or relatively benign off-road terrain and 
supported by the right kind of air power, groups of such vehicles would 
represent as much or more of a breakthrough in military technology as the 
machine gun or tank represented.  Deployed against an opponent that did not 
possess air superiority or significant heavy armor, Igor's RCCV would give 
its possessor a decisive advantage in a limited tactical range.  But consider 
what it can't do: It can't enter buildings, it would be subject to ambush in 
close urban quarters and it can't take or control uneven terrain or ground 
with significant vegetation.  Range and resupply considerations aside, in 
Kosovo, for example, a large number of such vehicles could easily take 
control of key open roadways and bridges.  But facing such a force, Serb 
forces would just do what Mao did in the face of Japan's superior mechanized 
military: Cede the roads and control the countryside, fighting an attritional 
war of ambush and logistical strangulation.

<p>
The limitations of a "first-generation RCCV" are even more apparent when one 
considers logistical factors.  How will these vehicles be resupplied with 
fuel and ammunition?  The automatic weapons Igor proposes to arm his RCCV 
with expend ammunition at a prodigious rate.  The amount of ammunition he's 
talking about would be expended with just a few minutes of sustained fire, at 
most.  RCCV operators would have to be extremely parsimonious with their 
trigger fingers, something not common among video gamers :-) Yes, they could 
form an effective firing line on an assault front for very short periods of 
time, but a savvy enemy would be willing to sustain losses in an initial 
engagement to cause the RCCV-equipped opponent to use up as much ammunition 
as possible.  

<p>
Similar problems develop with fuel.  While RCCVs like this might have a 
decent range in straight-line travel over improved roadways, any sort of 
rough-terrain travel or combat maneuvering would quickly shorten that range.  
Again, a smart opponent would employ tactics of movement to force the RCCVs 
to maneuver as much as possible.

<p>
So, how would these vehicles be reloaded and refueled?  Would there be 
remotely operated "tenders" trailing just behind the front line?  If so, 
reliably engaging ammo and fuel ports would require some fairly sophisticated 
robotics.  Furthermore, robotically or remotely operated resupply operations 
would present an inviting target.  If the RCCVs have to travel back to secure 
human-tended support, the effective combat range of an RCCV would be very 
short, indeed.

<p>
The development front for RCCVs therefore will be mobility and logistical 
improvements.  As for the former, a first-order improvement on the suggested 
design might involve equipping them with short-range remotely-operated 
rotorcraft (RORCs) for local reconnaissance and fire-suppression.  Imagine a 
squad of RCCVs coming under fire from anti-tank rocket snipers in a building. 
 The RCCVs launch ten one-meter long helicopter RORCs (with their own 
separate operators) that swarm the building, entering through windows and 
doors and suppressing the sniper fire with very small caliber semi-automatic 
fire, flash grenades, tear-gas and other short-range anti-personnel weapons.  
The RORCs could be disposable (perhaps used as weapons themselves, or to be 
recovered manually later) or, with some automated support, might be 
recoverable by the RCCVs "on the fly", so to speak.

<p>
The real RCCV mobility revolution will come when robotics advances to the 
point where an RCCV can be built with mobility approximating that of a human 
infantryman.  Assuming that the work of folks like Hugo de Garis bears fruit 
soon, this might well come fairly quickly.  I can envision a 
second-generation RCCV that would be little more than twice the size of a 
large human, with a six- or eight- legged spider-like mobility platform, upon 
which a swivelling sensor and weapon turret is mounted.  The mobility 
platform would have its own sensor suite and would be largely autonomous, 
merely responding to direction and speed inputs from the main human operator. 
 Some form of piezoelectric or other "electro-elastic" musculature would move 
the mobility legs.  Presumably the power source would have to be some kind of 
very high efficiency fuel cells or perhaps a gas micro-turbine with very 
highly compressed gas fuel (although the latter would generate a lot of heat, 
making infrared sensing a problem in both directions). RCCV walkers could be 
delivered to combat areas by wheeled or rotorcraft ROVs and would supplement 
first-generation RCCV light armored vehicles in combined-tactics skirmish 
lines.

<p>
Pure fuel and ammunition logistics will continue to be the primary limiting 
factor for even second-generation RCCVs, but with a semi-robotic 
"quartermaster corp", field resupply would become much more realistic and 
effective.

<p>
<a name="0952qlink1">Now, none of this addresses the electronic and information combat</a> that would 
<a name="0952qlink2">increasingly dominate the actual ground battlefield.</a>  With second generation 
<br>
<a name="0952qlink3">(c. 2010-2020) and then third generation (2020+) RCCVs, control of the <br>
dataflow to and from RCCVs would become decisive.  I trust</a> that super-strong 
<a name="0952qlink4">encryption could protect the data flow from hacking attack,</a> but EMP weapons 
<a name="0952qlink5">might well become extremely important for the defense against RCCVs.</a>  One can 
<a name="0952qlink6">imagine cryogenically-supported, superconducting capacitor EMP bombs being 
delivered aerially or with artillery, or even in the form of land mines.  
Internal automation could be hardened against EMP attack through</a> the use of 
<a name="0952qlink7">photonics, but what of radio?  Line-of-sight microwave and laser would be 
very important in such a battlefield, perhaps supported by a LEO</a> direct laser 
<a name="0952qlink8">network, supplemented by close-support ROV aerial laser nodes.</a>  With 
<a name="0952qlink9">sufficient miniaturization and hardening against acceleration damage, perhaps 
an RCCV force could even be supported by laser-node</a> artillery shells, 
<a name="0952qlink10">barraged continually over a battlefront, but we're talking FAST switching and 
HIGH network architecture flexibility here</a> . . .

<p>
Well, that's my three cents on RCCVs . . .
