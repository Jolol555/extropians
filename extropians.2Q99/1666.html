Yep, it's me the "optimistic-keep-context" movie goer. Perhaps, I just
view life (movies) with sugary sweet rose colored glasses.... but, I
thought Star Wars was just fine. I am not some huge fan, nor am I one that
dislikes the movies.

<p>
I loved the hype, though. I wanted to be one of those that saw it the
first day out. I love the merchandising, capitalism, and technology. I am
a movie product manager's dream come true. I am all for people getting
excited about a movie, waiting in line for hours, and buying way too many
action figures.

<p>
---tangent about to occur--<br>
<br>
I am tired of listening to the media and everyone else whine about Kosvo
and/or Columbine. I am sick of listening to misery. I want joy! I want
laughter! I want to skip and be joyous. If Star Wars can get into the news
for 10 mins and break down the usual force feeding of tragedy I am
constantly bombarded with to provide some flavor of excitement, I am ALL
for it! "Use the force."
<br>

So, back on track, to the movie *ahem* Let's keep a bit of context, shall
we? It is a MOVIE. It is for entertainment value. I have heard everything
from the characters suck to the mysticism being rationalized because it
does exist within the context of the movie. I hate to sound like the happy
one here, but lighten up. It is FUN! It is about going for the eye candy
and watching the United States as well as the rest of the world regroup in
a series of movies that in part changed how movies were done and what we
expected of them, forever. 

<p>
<a name="1674qlink1">On the technical side, the computer animation is wonderful, the special
effects were outstanding. In regards to the character, they were fine. It
is a prequeal for crying out loud. The story is setting up, I do not
expect in-depth psychological analysis of each. I _loved_ the outfit
and make done for the Queen. And my final (the glass is
half full dammit) assessment about the mysticism, it is a sci/fi adventure
movie. If you are going to accept the idea of the the plot even existing
at all, considering  the idea of  "the force" isn't' that much more of a
stretch. If you want non-fantasy, watch the history channel.

<p>
Smile, it increases your face value. Life is wonderful, enjoy it. Go see
the movie, and love it. You know you wanna!</a>
