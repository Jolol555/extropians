<i>&gt; I'm interested in clarifying something here. You have stated that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; are anti-government, and from the above you are also supportive of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; punitive (rather than rehabilitative) styles of prisons. I've got no</i><br>
<i>&gt; argument with someone holding these opinions, although I don't hold them</i><br>
<i>&gt; myself. There's some kind of common ground probably, because I wonder</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether there can really be a rehabilitating prison, and I imagine that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you would have some opinions on this subject.</i><br>

<p>
The only common ground is that the population of criminals we are
discussing has been produced by a social welfare state in a mercantilist
economy. That qualifies my opinion quite a bit. In the kind of world I
would like, criminals would get what they deserve at the crime scene at
the hands of the people they sought to victimize. Eventually the genes
<a name="1890qlink1">for criminal tendencies would be weeded out of the population by natural
selection.</a> Non-violent offenders would pay the costs of their crimes in
non-violent ways (IMHO, imprisoning a human being is a violent act).
Obviously this calls for a population of citizens who are fare more
interested in personal sovereignty and responsibility than the current
one.

<a href="1882.html#1885qlink2">&gt; The way I see it, if you don't trust the government, then you probably</a><br>
<i>&gt; want to have prisons which aren't too awful, because there would be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; fairly high chance of innocent people ending up there. Is this</i><br>
<i>&gt; fallacious reasoning? Do you see a seperation between the government and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the justice system which is relevant (ie: justice system is trustworthy,</i><br>
<i>&gt; government is not)?</i><br>

<p>
So long as the jury pool is made up of responsible intelligent,
informed  citizens, I need fear no government with respect to the
justice system. Obviously you see my dilemma.

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="1882.html#1885qlink3">&gt; I don't mean this post to be inflammatory (although it probably is). I'm</a><br>
<i>&gt; just interested in this juxtaposition of views.</i><br>

Hell no, we are not....
