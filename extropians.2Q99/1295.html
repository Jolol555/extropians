<a name="1304qlink1">I just finished Earthweb (I got it from Amazon as soon as I read about
its release here;  thank you!).  Overall, I found it highly enjoyable.
It's a great novel of ideas, esp. ideas that we frequently discuss on
the list; featured
<br>
</a>prominently are:
 
<p>
rotons
<br>
private law enforcement agencies
<br>
collaborative filtering
<br>
idea futures
<br>
fees for unsolicited email
<br>
credibility ratings for web postings
<br>
free-market incentives for research
<br>
private currencies
<br>
widespread encryption &amp; surveillance tech 

<p>
Background stuff mentioned but not expanded upon:

<p>
the demise of Microsoft
<br>
the demise of the Federal govt in "The 
<br>
Entitlement Crash"
<br>
privatization of most govt functions
<br>
knowledge agents

<p>
Sequels are a definite &amp; welcome (by me) possibility.

<p>
The story moves pretty quickly (all the action takes place over a month)
&amp; only occasionally lapses into long expositions on various ideas,
usually justified in the context of the scene in question.  I must admit
some of the characters seemed a bit 2-dimensional to me, but not enough
to
<br>
detract from my enjoyment.

<p>
Things I didn't see that surprised me:

<p>
not a single mention of nanotech
<br>
no mention of life-extension (2 characters
are centenarians, but it's not clear how
unusual this is)
<br>
not much in the way of biotech

<p>
Since the novel is set approximately 50-60
years in the future, I suspect most on this list would expect these
things to be well
<br>
along in their development by then.  A curious omission, but not really
detrimental to the story.  

<p>
<a name="1308qlink1">Though it's probably preaching to the choir, I recommend this book to
all on the list.
