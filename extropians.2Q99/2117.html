The police have a vested interest in exaggerating the problem of illegal
firearms, just as they have an interest in exaggerating the value of
seized drug hauls. Last figures I heard suggested 250,000 illegal guns
at most, and probably a lot less, in the UK.

<p>
Please quantify. IIRC, the murder rate per capita in the UK is about a
tenth of the murder rate in the USA, although for lesser crimes the
rates are generally similar.</a>

Note that I am _not_ trying to make a case for banning guns; I deplore the
UK's gun control regime.<a name="2121qlink1"> However, I believe that the issues surrounding
violence in American society are orthogonal to the widespread ownership of
guns; there are cultural influences at work here that bear investigation.</a>
