<a name="2177qlink1">Joe, you're hurting your credibility.</a>  Several posters, including
<a name="2177qlink2">myself, have raised the question of what standards of proof and due
process your concept would require.</a>  You resort to profanity and
<a name="2177qlink3">crass insults but don't answer the concerns based on historically
documented abuse of gun registration laws to disarm minorities
(sometimes as a prelude to genocide or "ethnic cleansing").</a>

<p>
<a name="2177qlink4">The biggest loophole in your proposal is "Mentally deficient or
deranged".  It is a documented fact that allowing bureaucracies to
determine who is deficient or deranged can be abused, (viz. Germany
1936), and you wrote,</a>

<p>
  "To support my point I state this:  The guy I was just referring
   to who stated he would rather kill a police officer (who most
   likely has a wife and family) or other law enforcement officers
   than have his gun taken away SHOULD have his license revoked
   for saying that and have his weapons taken away as he is
   talking like a potential killer and is clearly a threat to
   the general public from my perspective."

<p>
<a name="2177qlink6">Here we see an example of the slippery slope- you claim that this
person is deranged *only* due to his political views.  Of the groups
on your list below, only _convicted_ violent criminals and children
may be unequivocally denied the right to keep and bear arms- the
others would be an open door to political oppression and tyranny.</a>

<p>
<a name="2177qlink7">You want to disarm the man described above simply because he *does
not want to be disarmed*, and is willing to fight such oppression.</a> 
<a name="2177qlink8">Now do you see why some of us question your motives and goals?  Your
thinking is a catch-22... you seem to be saying that as long as a
person doesn't mind being forcibly disarmed, he may (might?) keep
those arms.</a>

<p>
<a name="2177qlink9">You feel that people are misquoting and misrepresenting you.  I
quote you verbatim, then point out your logical inconsistency.  Can
we discuss this without inflammatory words and rhetoric?
