It's amazing how sometimes my conversations overlap.  Here's a
quote from an email I got from my sister, Kate, recently.  She's
in Vet school.  I find this topic fascinating -- hopefully some
of you will also enjoy this.



<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;      Testosterone plays a major role in aggressive behavior and  I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; think there's any question that males tend to be more aggressive than</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; females (unless the female is protecting young).  We routinely castrate the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; males of most of our domestic species because they are too aggressive (and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; too smelly).  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How does castration affect their smell?</i><br>

<p>
 Testosterone acts on the secondary sex glands of the males of many
species,
<br>
eg: cats, goats (intact bucks really smell bad),  ferrets, and others.
These glands then produce secretions loaded with pheromones that act as
olfactory signals to other members of their species.  
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Body builders who inject anabolic steroids (testosterone) turn</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; yellow (because they're damaging their livers), break out with acne, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; experience episodes of rage. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, I'd certainly experience episodes of rage if I turned yellow and</i><br>
<i>&gt;broke out in acne!  But that's interesting -- I didn't know that </i><br>
<i>&gt;steriods were related to testosterone.  Are they really the same thing,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or just closely related?  Does pure testosterone have the muscle and</i><br>
<i>&gt;performance enhancing characteristics of steroids?</i><br>

<p>
Steroids are any of the cholesterol derived hormones in the body
including
<br>
testosterone, estrogen and corticosteroids.  The term "steroids" is
usually
<br>
used to mean corticosteroids which in the body are produced by the
adrenal
<br>
gland and exogenously are used to control inflammation and produce
immunosuppression (to treat autoimmune diseases or prevent organ
transplant
<br>
rejection).  Corticosteroids are catabolic steroids which means they
cause a
<br>
breakdown of muscle and increased fat deposition.  Testosterone is an
anabolic steroid and it encourages growth of bone and muscle.  A
synthetic
<br>
form is available and is a controlled substance.  This is the substance
the
<br>
body builders abuse.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; There are certainly other factors that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; influence a tendency toward aggression, as violence can be seen in castrated</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; animals and females as well, but hormones certainly are a major contributor.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     I think when one compares humans and other species on a population level</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the similarities in this regard are striking but I also think it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; important to note that there are differences in aggressive tendencies among</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; individuals within any mammalian species.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The book "Demonic Males" focused on the Great Apes, and only</i><br>
<i>&gt;occasionally</i><br>
<i>&gt;mentioned other animal species.  I'd be interested to know if the myth </i><br>
<i>&gt;about ours being the only species that murders our own kind is not just</i><br>
<i>&gt;not true for the great apes, but also not true for other animals.  That</i><br>
<i>&gt;is, do animals other than the great apes also murder their own kind?</i><br>

<p>
Absolutely.  A male lion who takes over a pride immediately kills all
the
<br>
cubs sired by the previous male.  This behavior has also been noted in
colonies of domestic feral cats.  Packs of dogs sometimes gang up and
kill a
<br>
weak  or injured member of the pack.  Mice in confinement frequently
kill
<br>
one another.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I have to go read about diseases of the cornea now.
Take care,
<br>
Kate
