<p>
Kind of my point.  Shouldn't we be working out how to achieve this,
rather than promoting access to weaponry?
I see offensive/defensive capability as a sidetrack on the path to
transhumanism, myself.

I have no real interest in the political actions people ascribe to my
ideas, I just think them, and out they come. If people don't like what I
say, it's the key between 's' and 'f'

Guns make no distinction at all in this regard. Dead is dead.

True.

<p>
Absolutely.  These are the areas we should be discussing, not the
ability or otherwise to shoot people.
