But, gee, Dwayne, if everyone WERE peaceful, rational, etc. why the heck 
would they "need" (and/or "WANT", for that matter) guns, tac nukes, or 
you-name-the-weapon.  That's why we have to nudge the meta-
<br>
(and even meta-meta-)INSTITUTIONAL **MEMES** (and, yes even *meta*-memes, to <br>
the extent that these are even at all easily influenceable (at least in the 
short-run)) toward what might as well be called the *new*  MAD---*Mutual 
Assured Defense*.  This can be done by (though obviously on somewhat of a 
piecemeal basis at first) establishing both nano- (and, a fortiori, 
micro-)level active shields AND some sort(s) of macro-level active shield(s) 
to preclude the initiation of aggression.  Now the pro-gun people see their 
position as an interim "2nd best" position, since we don't (yet) have the 
tech to do what I just envisioned.  But once we bootstrap something like  
that into place, indeed, who the heck **would** need/want to carry a 
weapon(s) *anyway*!  (Although, as a liberal individualist, I would say that 
a person would still have the right to pack heat if s/he chose to---and 
<br>
(almost) needless-to-say, I should think that Mike (Lorrey), Joe (Dees) and <br>
Brian (among others here) would emphatically agree.)

<p>
Thanks in advance for your feedback!

Very best regards to all,
