<p>
I'd like to reiterate some points that Max made recently about the role of 
the list, the "whereabouts" of valuable list "old-timers" and "extropians 
elders" and the progress of transhumanism generally.  

<p>
Many of the people who were early members of ExI and of this list's ancestors 
are still very much associated with ExI, but aren't associated with the list 
now because they're simply too busy.  Very many of the core projects moving 
what I call the "transhumanist agenda" forward have now become more than 
full-time jobs.  At least one of the people whose name is associated with 
transhumanist ideas as much or more than Max More's is doesn't even open his 
own email any more because he's too darned busy.  As much as such people are 
missed from this forum, their absence is a good thing: It means that the 
original transhumanist vision that informed extropianism was essentially 
valid and that we're moving into a time when really smart people are doing a 
lot more than just talking.

<p>
One might conclude from this realization that the extropians online community 
has served its purpose as a "seed pod" and that its time has passed.  Rather 
than the image of a "seed pod", however, I think that a more correct and 
valuable analogy is to an incubator.  With such mainstream figures as Francis 
Fukuyama (and *George Will*!) considering "post-humanism" to be a valid view 
of our future, the number of people coming to our ideas for the first time is 
increasing every day.  Subscription to this list is one of the primary means 
that newcomers to our ideas have for judging them.  Just as some of the 
bright lights of the original subscribers to the extropians online community 
have gone on to become active pioneers of our post-human future, new 
subscribers to this list now and in the future will help to carry forward the 
torch lighted by the original pioneers.  It will take far more people than 
can be completely enumerated in one posting to this list to follow through on 
their trailblazing work.  Maintaining this forum as a place for quality 
discussion of transhumanist and extropian ideas and values is important work 
and people who do their part to maintain a high quality of discussion here do 
our common cause a great service by providing a good introduction and 
exposition of our ideas.  Advanced discussion here is also very important: 
New ideas ARE incubated here and they DO feed back to folks who aren't on the 
list.

<p>
Indicating that we are a friendly social community is also just as important: 
Bright people want to be associated with open, fair and kind individuals.  
Conversely, those who degrade the quality of discussion here may literally 
postpone key developments by turning away new talent and enthusiasm: The 
young biologist, artist, physicist, writer, computer engineer or investor who 
turns away in disgust at petty squabbling is one less bright mind that could 
be put to the task of building a better future.

<p>
If you feel that you've mastered "the basics" and that it's time for you to 
broaden your personal involvement in transhumanism and ExI beyond just 
subscribing to the list, there are plenty of opportunities to do so.  
Organizing and hosting the EXTRO conferences are some of the primary 
functions ExI performs and constitute some of the highest value ExI adds to 
the transhumanist community.  Plan on attending this year's conference in 
August.  Better yet, volunteer to help with some of the many details of 
hosting the conference that we'll have to take care of.  Become a 
full-fledged member of ExI (it's not expensive) and support the group with a 
few dollars. Consider making a one-time donation -- even a small one -- to 
help defray the cost of this year's conference or some other project.  Form 
or join an existing local ExI chapter or transhumanist discussion group.  
<br>
(Billy and Jocelyn Brown have recently done a great job of getting the <br>
Textropians group organized down here on the Third Coast -- thank you!)  

<p>
As Robin pointed out, take the time and effort to write an article for 
Extropy Online.  Write a letter to the editor of your local paper, or even an 
editorial.  Send a copy of an interesting article or web page or even just a 
note to a local TV reporter -- they'll often do stories based on ideas 
suggested by viewers. (Some of us down here in Texas have been interviewed 
for surprisingly well-balanced stories on cryonics.)  Contact a high school 
or college professor about giving a guest lecture.

<p>
Become a Senior Associate of the Foresight Institute, an organization with a 
close and synergistic relationship with ExI.  If you live in the Bay Area, 
you can volunteer to help out at Foresight: Chris and Tanya can always use a 
little assistance with the mundane -- or even the less mundane -- work of 
doing the astonishing number of things that Foresight and IMM do.  Get in 
touch with Alcor or another of the cryonics organizations: They can often use 
volunteer help.  Explore participation or membership in many of the 
organizations that share values with extropianism, like Cato and Reason.

<p>
Something that a lot of the suggestions above have in common is personal 
face-to-face networking.  There is an increasing number of active 
transhumanist projects under way in the world and getting to know the people 
involved is one of the best ways to get involved yourself.  ExI's, 
Foresight's and Alcor's conferences and their analogs in Europe are the best 
way I know to meet the real actors in the growing transhumanist movement.  
Developing the web of personal contacts "behind the scenes" is one of the 
most important function served by ExI and Foresight (I know that a lot of 
real work got done at the hotel bar Saturday night at the last Foresight 
conference -- our future was HAPPENING there.)

<p>
So the bottom line is that it's not "all just talk", but the "talk" is a 
vital part of "it".

<p>
Onward!
