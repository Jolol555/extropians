Darin, I went with four other engineer coworkers.  We skipped out
at lunch Friday and viewed it.  When they showed the racer pods,
all five of us simultaneously broke out laughing.  People stared.  {8^D
We imagined the Naboo propulsion engineers who could make
a machine hover noiselessly in an apparent 1 G field, but to make
the thing go forward, hmmmm, thats tough.  How about... two *enormous*
air breathing jet engines!  Yea, that aughta do it!  {8^D  We loved
that.  Im coming to appreciate the understated humor in the star
wars series. {8^D

<p>
I was in fact thinking of those droid fighters.  Definitely more advanced
than the (50 yr?) later storm troopers with the cheesy white body
armor that evidently didnt protect them from anything.  I would like
to have one or or two of those droid warriors.  {8^D

<p>
In retrospect, I think this might be part of the joke.  I liked this episode
more than the previous ones.  I liked their explanation for the force too,
kinda nano, didnt you think?  spike
