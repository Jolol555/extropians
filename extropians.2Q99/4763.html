You're hanging onto the past, Eliezer...

These are the people I mean, although I wonder if they are merely hype
sometimes.

<p>
Although the kiddie-crackers might do some funny things - imagine an
uploaded Larry Ellison or Bill Gates making an address to his legions of
fanatic followers, and finding that all he could utter was "Phurry Phunky
Phreakers Cracked Me, I am a big losser, U are all krap".
