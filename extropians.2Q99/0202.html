<p>
Fair enough.  I can easily see setting up a defense-oriented national
government that would prevent PPAs from staging an armed takeover.
Preventing peacefull monopolist is more problematic - we can do it, but it
gives the government enough power (and enough leeway in its use) to make me
nervous.

<p>
<a href="0199.html#0202qlink3">&gt; &gt;4) The consequences of even a momentary lapse in coverage</a><br>
<i>&gt; are catastrophic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It would seem a straightforward to sign up for backup PPAs, so one is</i><br>
<i>&gt; always covered.</i><br>

<p>
If you have the money, and your PPA contract allows it, yes.  But neither of
these is a given.<a name="0251qlink1">  My worry here is that there will be a not insignificant
number of people who end up without any valid contract, and that means there
will be a market for their exploitation.  That creates a real risk for
everyone, in the form of a group of predators looking for unprotected prey.</a>
This is a step down from the situation in a mainimalist state, where
<a name="0251qlink2">slavers, organleggers and other unsavory types can't incorporate and float
an IPO.</a>

<p>
<a href="0199.html#0202qlink4">&gt; &gt;5) The customer is at the mercy of the PPA, not vice versa..</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is this the same sense that a patient is at the mercy of a doctor?</i><br>

<p>
No, its in the same sense that a citizen is at the mercy of a despot.  If my
doctor does me harm, I (or my relatives) can sue him in a neutral court.  If
my PPA does me harm, I can sue it in its own court if it deigns to allow me
that priveledge.

<p>
<a href="0199.html#0202qlink5">&gt; &gt;6) A private law regime with dozens of PPAs, each with multiple law</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;products and complex inter-company enforcement contracts, would be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; legal regime far more complex than the one we now live in.  ....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a more serious objection in my view.  But noting how people</i><br>
<i>&gt; want simplicity is often a major argument for nationalizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; industries.</i><br>

<p>
True.<a name="0251qlink3">  But my concern here is that the complexity rises so fast that I am
not at all sure that it is possible for ordinary humans to function in such
a society.</a>  I actually sat down and tried to figure out how to fix a lot of
the problems I mentioned here (and others) through market means.  I gave it
up when I realized that the average individual was going to have to
negotiate more contracts in a year than I have in my entire life.

<p>
<a href="0199.html#0202qlink6">&gt; If people really really like simplicity enough, most all PPAs may end</a><br>
<i>&gt; up enforcing the same law.  But that same law might be better.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcement styles and quality could still vary widely.</i><br>

<p>
I don't see the Extropians and the Cristian Scientists purchasing the same
legal code.

<p>
Perhaps it would help if I outlined the kind of state I see as being a
superior alternative?
