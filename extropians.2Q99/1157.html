<a name="1173qlink1"><a name="1163qlink1">Most of the texts of the great library were likely copies of the
Illiad and Odyssey. By all accounts there were a great redundancy
</a>
among the books (keeping many versions was of course a good way of
getting around copier's mistakes). 

<p>
Would the hellenic culture have brought us to a technological
revolution a millennium earlier if the library had remained? I
seriously doubt that, because the problems of classical technological
development were more social and cultural. A widespread view among the
thinkers that practical work was beneath them and that abstract ideas
with no empiricism was the most elegant form of knowledge,
anti-rational mystery cults, a society based on slavery and heavily
centralised command economies were some of the reasons the library
doesn't appear to have been the key to technological development. 

<p>
Still, one can dream about a world where Archimedes wasn't killed and
his tradition lived on, uniting with the Epicurean ideas described</a> by
Lucretius. Then we might have been on our way towards the stars in
nanotech spaceships now. And half the crew would be named Marcus,
Gaius and Titus :-)
