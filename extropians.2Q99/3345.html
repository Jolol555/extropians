I once had a very drunk old woman walk up to me around the corner from a
rave and point a revolver at my chest saying "I can't get my cigarette
lighter to work" as she pulled the trigger several times.  I like to
tell this story to people as it is one of the few times in my life when
I was absolutely convinced I was going to die, right now.  It was
interesting what went through my mind at the time.


<p>
Anyway, the reason I bring this up is I had an obviously drunk out of
their skull person wander up to me with a huge great revolver in her
hand, point it at me and repeatedly pull the trigger. I didn't actually
realise I was about to be shot until the gun was pointing straight at
the middle of my chest and she was pulling the trigger.

<p>
Why?  Because I do not live in an environment where guns are common.  As
it turns out, she had a metal replica pistol, but I didn't know that at
the time.  I still don't think I have ever seen a pistol aside from the
ones strapped to the sides of the cops here. I just wouldn't recognise
them, as they are so rare.


<p>
<a href="3207.html#3345qlink2">&gt; I know when I called the cops one night when I saw a guy with a gun, they</a><br>

<i>&gt; was.. I never actually really saw it close.. it was night.. I assumed, I</i><br>

<p>
I would not have realised.

I suppose there are a few plugged australians buried in the US...
