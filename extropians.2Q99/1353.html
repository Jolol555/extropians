<a name="1632qlink3"><a name="1367qlink1"><a name="1359qlink1">I'm actually not intending to be offensive by the things I am posting</a> on
the list.  I come off that way sometimes because I like to push peoples'
buttons especially if there really is no reason for them to be upset
except for their own psychological insecurities.</a>  Then, if they are
upset, I like to point out why they are upset.  I believe that pointing
out to people the things that may end up being quite dangerous to them is
an ultimately kind thing to do, even though they may be temporarily
upset.</a>  

<p>
<a name="1359qlink2">The fact that people are getting upset over what I am saying when they
could just as easily choose not to be upset indicates problems with their
own coping mechanisms.  People are certainly free to ignore me if they
are offended by what I write.  I am just pointing things out that seem
obvious to me, trying to be helpful.  I don't think I am forcing my view
on anyone.  I'm just sharing my perspective, which I have found valuable.
 You can accept it as the gift I intend it to be, you can ignore it if
you don't like it, you can be offended if you want to be, or for that
matter you can clean your bedroom in response to what I right.</a>  

<p>
<a name="1367qlink2"><a name="1359qlink3">My point is that your response is essentially your choice.  There is no
real reason for anyone to be offended who doesn't want to be in the first
place.  In that case, they should thank me for assisting them in the
emotional experiences they are already seeking in their life, although
they would most likely find someone else to be offended by, if not me.</a></a>
