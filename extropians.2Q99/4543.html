time and energy thinking about and having sex, and I'm constantly
being distracted by sexual thoughts.</a> Sometimes I think it would be
better--now that I've sired all the children I plan to--to just get
out of the sex game altogether. (I'm 39, married, three children.)
</a>
Castration would be a little extreme (permanent) and I don't know
exactly what the effects would</a> be. I'm sure there are drugs that can
<a name="4547qlink2">help, but I don't know how effective they are, how safe they are for
long-term use, or even what they're called or how to get them.

<p>
<a name="4557qlink1">Is there any practical relief for this problem available today?
