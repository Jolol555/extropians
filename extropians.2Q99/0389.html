Yes.  I agree that it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the human brain
is no more designed to be happy and immortal than it is designed to run
spreadsheets.  But I didn't make the claim that the brain was designed to be
happy or immortal or predisposed to run spreadsheets.  I just said that I
disagreed with the idea proposed in the film that the brain is designed to
be unable to adapt to highly favorable environments.  Human behavior is much
to flexible and adaptive to make such a sweeping proposal about the species.
Fact is, a large percentage of us seem to be adapting quite nicely to what
is, relative to the past, a highly favorable environment.  And I expect that
trend to continue.
