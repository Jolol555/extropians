<a name="1442qlink1">While no two humans are exactly the same, we are all of one race, the human
race, and we all share the experience of life in an essentially identical carbon
based life form structure. We all work for continuing survival while in this
structure, and hope for a happy, safe, and good life for ourselves and loved
ones. Therefore, everyone has a common desire for the best life attainable.
Since visions of the best life attainable are as numerous as the number of
people, the only universally acceptable definition would be, "the ability of
each person to live as they desire". Humans could voluntarily coordinate their
efforts to obtain that ability.</a>


<p>
<a href="1427.html#1440qlink2">&gt; IMO, we are much better off recognizing that no one has all the answers,</a><br>

<p>
<a name="1449qlink1">True. Therefore, humanity should devote some more resources toward finding the
answers.

<p>
<a name="1442qlink2">With the right knowledge all illness can be cured. With the right knowledge
pollution can be eliminated. With the right knowledge all tangible and
intangible human needs and desires can be fulfilled. With the right knowledge,
any problem can be solved, and any desired result can be achieved. With the
right knowledge everyone can have a high quality of life, a heaven on earth, a
Utopia. Therefore, knowledge is the key to a better world. If humanity
recognized this reality, and devoted more resources toward knowledge, we could
accelerate the pace at which we reach a better world.</a>

<p>
<a name="1442qlink3">The three basic ways of interacting with knowledge, are: 1) dissemination from
accessing stored information, through teaching, or from other methods of
communication; 2) use through actions based on awareness of knowledge; and 3)
acquisition of new knowledge from research, through experience, or from</a> other
avenues of discovery. Humanity has achieved proficient methods for dissemination
of information and simply needs to better utilize the same in order to
facilitate the use of knowledge. Yet, less than 2% of global productivity is
devoted toward finding new knowledge (research and development). Clearly
Humanity could and should be investing more in its future.</a>
