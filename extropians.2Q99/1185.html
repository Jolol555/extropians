<a name="1189qlink1"><a name="1186qlink1">I don't think that with the technology we have now we can construct the massive pyramids, temples, and stadiums the ancients built.</a> They had no cranes, bulldozers, or CAD, but they were able to position stones-transported from quarries, to heights one would think might have been impossible. We still don't know who built Stonehenge or how they transported those massive stones. We still can't construct Crystal Skulls without tool markings.</a>

<a name="1189qlink2">Hewlitt-Packard, I was told but can't verify yet, did a rigorous analysis of the Crystal Skulls but didn't reveal their findings. HP says this was to prevent the leaking of trade secrets.</a>

<a name="1189qlink3">There are also pyramids in China, Mexico/Middle America, Japan, and Sudan.</a> Easter Islands stone heads also make mincemeat of our preconceived notions that the ancients were technologically primitive

<a name="1189qlink4"><a name="1186qlink2">In Egypt there are underground corridors with paintings and bas-reliefs on the walls. No evidence of torchmarks on the ceilings.</a> Imhotep calculated the circumference of the earth to about 25,000 miles, pretty impressive for some primitives. About 1000 years before Imhotep, Berossus(if I got his name right), a Sumerian priest, did the same. The Dogon tribe in Mali knew of the existence of Sirius A&amp;B before western astronomy did, so do the Hopi tribe in the US.
