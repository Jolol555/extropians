<a name="3561qlink1">I dont think banning a senseless circular flamewar on guns means that
the list condones any of the points of view expressed in the myriad
postings.

<p>
The increasingly abusive posts, and the fact that the participants in
this argument see fit to twist any of the other threads onto the gun
topic is just driving people off the list.

<p>
Please can we all just talk about something else, and if you want to
flame me about guns then do it off-list.

<p>
from Joe Dees:

<pre>
&gt; It is now up to the officers of this list whether it will retain the 
&gt; integrity to function as a credible voice as we journey towards our 
&gt; common future, or whether it will degrade into nothing more than a 
&gt; propaganda front for and arm of the NRA and other militia and 
&gt; vigilante type individuals and organizations, with ideological purity 
&gt; and hegemony strictly enforced by a militant, cynical, stigmatizing  
&gt; and self-serving few.  May you make the proper decision.
