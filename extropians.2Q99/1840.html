<a name="1844qlink2">If you exclude crimes which are lesser or are not offenses in other countries</a> we'd have a far more comparative level of imprisonment. Additionally China has a higher fraction in prison, if you include 're-education camps' as prisons. I find it interesting that the three most powerful nations have the highest prison populations....

<p>
<a name="1844qlink3">On the other hand, since most crime here is commited by criminals</a> on other criminals, I can't say that you could call all of our prisoners 'oppressed'. As far as I know the only throught crimes here in the US are pornographic pedophilia, telling the President what you really think of him, looking at female co-workers the wrong way, and disliking the publicly protected ethnic groups.
