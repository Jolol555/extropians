I don't see sentience or consciousness as a requirement for experiencing
qualia.  In fact, I would state that qualia occur at the same primitive
levels as emotion and intelligence.</a>

<p>
Qualia seem to be more of an evolutionary artifact than an emergent or some
other heretofore unexplained phenomenon.  It seems to me that the
experience of qualia is an evolutionary prejudice to aid in the
discrimination of important signals, primarily to augment the decision
making process.  

<p>
For example, humans and many animals have very specific hardwired emotional
responses to different colors.  "Redness", for example, triggers a
low-level "danger" and "risk" response in humans, generally proportional to
the amount of "redness" in their environment.  This is most likely a
reflection of the fact that throughout evolutionary history, many
dangerous, risky, or negative things are red: poisonous snakes, poisonous
insects, blood, etc.  And it isn't just reflected in humans.  Birds also
respond to "redness" in a similar, though less context sensitive fashion;
insects with red markings are generally an indication of toxicity or
distastefulness to birds.  The experience of qualia is a filter that
evolved to feed (or perhaps create) hardwired prejudices in response to the
environment.  Having more intelligence only seems to affect how aware
animals are of the context surrounding the qualia.

<p>
Now I realize that to a certain extent this is a vast simplification.  I
will grant that this doesn't explain why "red is red", but I view such
distinctions as arbitrary and immaterial.  Even if your experience of
"redness" is different than mine, it does not change the fact that your
hardwired response to the experience is similar to mine at the lowest
levels.  Selection pressure reinforces specific discriminations that are
useful to the survival of the species, but individual responses are
tempered by the context of our experience.  Our manipulation of these
subtle prejudices (like selecting the color of your car) reflect our own
experiential context for these qualia.

<p>
I can't think of a reason why the experience of qualia should not exist as
a result of evolutionary prejudice.  I certainly see how such
discrimination could evolve, but I don't see how it is necessarily critical
to consciousness, particularly for AI where there would be no intrinsic
source or reason for such discrimination to exist.
