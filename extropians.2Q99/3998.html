They unabashedly state they are out to 'punish', no other purpose.

Any reforms like this must be carefully managed by the prison officials,
lest they become avenues for computer and phone crime, etc. Presently here,
prisoners have cell phones or actual phone lines into their cells, and some
gang leaders operate from prison with less risk than they did on the streets.

<p>
Our officials have cut back on 'priveleges' in our jails. Weight training
was banned when it was seen as merely a way for the bullies to keep
stronger than the sheep. Books and the like are being 'soft' on inmates.
College courses have been discontinued in some states.

<a name="4047qlink1">Putting one's wife in prison - assuming she's an accomplice, I guess, would
be a real departure from our present system. I have heard of women's
prisons allowing mothers to keep their children during their sentence. I
wonder if anyone has statistics on children raised in jail? Would spouses
be allowed to follow their mate into the slammer?</a>

<p>
If we ever manage to convince our solons that victimless crimes are just
that, and to repeal the laws prohibiting them, the end of the world will be
nigh..

They don't care - they are only concerned with the image of being PC 'tough
