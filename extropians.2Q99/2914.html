<a href="2859.html#2914qlink1">&gt; The early environmental deficit appears to be ameliorated with time and</a><br>
<i>&gt; exposure to more environment.</i><br>

<p>
Not exactly.  Children do not chose their parents/schools/environment.  But adults
are free to seek out an environment that suits them. Thus they eventually go in
the direction they were genetically disposed to go in the first place.

<p>
I.E. they become the type of person they were genetically meant to be.

<p>
And if I had my way, the education system, would focus on helping children
discover what their natural inclinations and interest are, and pair them up with a
mentor who would help them develop those inclinations.
