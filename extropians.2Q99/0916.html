Historical simulations, especially creating the most accurate possible 
recreations of historically significant people.  I imagine a "hobby" that 
would be fabulously expensive in computational terms in which the historical 
circumstances of the birth and development of specific historical figures is 
simulated in as much detail as possible, in an attempt to "grow" 
personalities that mimic as closely as possible the real personalities of 
specific individuals about whom a lot of biographical detail exists.  These 
individuals would of course be only rough approximations of the originals, 
but success could be measured in terms of how closely the "output" of such 
individuals matched the historical record.

I have an idea for an SF novel in which a Power decides to recreate Mary 
Shelley in this way, and then, of course, falls in love with her . . . "The 
Matrix" meets "Frankenstein" meets "Time after Time"
