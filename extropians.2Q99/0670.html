Somewhere amidst multiple universes it is hinted that Michael Lorrey might have said:

<p>
<a href="0584.html#0670qlink1">&gt;Actually, if you go by Lyle's argument, the grey goo will sit on its ass and refuse to do anything</a><br>
<i>&gt;until we give it a paycheck to do so,...</i><br>

<p>
Lyle's argument?  Lyle's argument!  
<br>
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey!
<br>
That way lies madness.

<p>
Trying to find logical consistency in Lyle's little sandbox is like searching for buried treasure in the kitty litter.  You may find something, but your girlfriend won't want to wear it as a neckless.

<p>
His entire Geniebuster's website is the online hissy-fit of a rejected nano groupie.  (As he more or less states with atypical clarity in his intro.)

<p>
I think the bard was talking about Geniebuster's when he said:

<p>
	"A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."

<pre>
	I read through the thing.  It seemed a waste of time.  It was like listening to Rush Limbaugh.  He sounds as if he has something to say, you wait patiently for his "argument" to come together.  He wanders all over the logical landscape on his way to... I don't know, ("Eric Drexler's a big dummy!" maybe?) you tell me.  And when he gets there, there's no there there.   There's no end, there's no point, there never was, and there was precious little logical cohesion along the way.  
	Like eating cardboard pizza.  A waste of a good appetite.  What's the point?  

	However, he does seem to stimulate discussion.  He made me go back and check my work.  That was healthy.  So it wasn't a total loss.
