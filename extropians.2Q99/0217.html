'Initiation of force' is a concept often used by libertarians when making
broad statements of principle.  But in specific instances of use of force
it can be unclear whether it is an initiation of force, often because of
lack of information.  For example, if a woman snatches a purse from
another woman and runs off, the police and the victim may find the purse
snatcher a short time later, holding the stolen purse.  The victim says
the purse is hers, and the thief says the purse is her own purse.  The
victim says she can specify the contents of the purse, but the thief
refuses to turn over the purse for examination.  To an observer who does
not know who the true owner is, it would appear to be an initiation of
force to take the purse away from the thief, even if only to examine the
contents in an effort to determine true ownership.


<p>
<a name="0219qlink2">Generally, when a suspect is arrested and held for trial, it is at least
an apparent initiation of force against the suspect.  The suspect may, or
may not, be in fact guilty.</a>

<p>
<a name="0253qlink1"><a name="0219qlink3">In practice, a limited amount of initiation of force may be a price that
has to be paid in order to have a functioning criminal and civil justice
system.</a></a>
