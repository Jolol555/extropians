Very true.  As a nutrition researcher and a vegetarian, I am convinced that
<a name="3792qlink1">the value of vegetarianism is high-fiber, low-fat, and other qualities that
have little to do with animal-origin, and more to do with the fact that meat
is fatty and low-fiber.</a>  Eating lean chicken or fish, and occasional lean
beef can be good.  Avoiding animal product totally can solve these problem
easily, but then you have other issues in making sure you get enough protein
and vitamin B12.

<a name="3548qlink1">Most studies find little difference between the races at each economic
level.  Access to healthcare, proper nutrition, working conditions, and
living conditions have more influence over longevity than race.</a>

Adventist
<br>
<a href="3469.html#3540qlink9">&gt; will become darker skinned.  This will cause the much advertised</a><br>
<i>&gt; life span bonus to shrink, compared to the average population, and may</i><br>
<i>&gt; eventually even go negative.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
