An article I came across that shows some prisons using incentives to
control the inmates behavior;  I believe this coes from the Oregonian :



<p>
You can take away their TV, end their exercise time or throw them into
solitary, but the best way Benton County Jail officials have found to
control unruly inmates is "nutra-loaf." 
               Fear of subsisting on nothing but
the pasty-tasting concoction of bread, imitation cheese, beans and
carrots three times a day has miscreants shaping up, jailers say. 
               Nutraloaf was spawned in Clark
County and is becoming popular with other jails. Although it is highly
nutritious, inmates have filed lawsuits in Washington, Oregon, and
federal courts against the food, saying eating it three times a day
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. All the lawsuits failed. 
               While other inmates are dining on
macaroni and cheese, salad with ranch dressing and chocolate chip
cookies, those being punished get one nutraloaf at each meal. 
               Each dense one-pound loaf contains
about 1,000 calories. Ingredients include whole wheat bread, imitation
cheese, grated carrots, canned spinach, raisins, beans, vegetable oil,
tomato paste, instant milk, and dehydrated potato flakes. It is served
cold. 
<br>
               "I don't recall anybody asking for
seconds," said Ardie Jones, the jail food service manager. 
How to make nutraloaf: 
<br>
6 slices whole wheat bread.
<br>
1.5 cups imitation cheese
<br>
<i>.75 cup drained spinach</i><br>
.75 cup grated carrots.<br>
.5 cup raisins<br>
<br>
3 cups cooked great northern beans
<br>
4 tbs. vegetable oil
<br>
1 cup tomato paste
<br>
.75 cup instant nonfat dry milk.<br>
.5 cup dehydrated potato flakes <br>
<br>
               Mix ingredients into a bowl. Pour
into three loaf pans. Bake at 325 degrees for 40 minutes. Makes 3
one-pound loaves.
