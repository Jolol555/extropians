<a name="2041qlink1"><a href="2023.html#2035qlink1">&gt; He announced his willingness, even his eagerness, to shoot people </a><br>
<i>&gt; in order to protect his right to possess the very gun with which he </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be shooting these people...  All he has to do is mistake</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone's intentions ONCE, and he'll shoot them dead...</i><br>

<p>
He said he would shoot someone who came to take his weapon.  In
what way could he mistake their intentions?  It is the invaders
with badges and and a bad law on their side who are the agressors
here, not our citizen, for whom you have not the slightest bit
of evidence of any agressiveness at all (take me for example:
I've said such things many times and will again, but I've never
raised a hand in anger in my life, much less a weapon).  If such
a badged invader were to break down the man's door, announce
himself and head for the guns, he'd be getting exactly what such
a barbarian deserves, "orders" notwithstanding.</a>
