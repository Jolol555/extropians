Or maybe there would be a chance Egan would let you have the
rights for free or cheap if you could show him something
spectacular to convince him you'd do a good job with it?

<p>
I'm currently trying to teach myself Maya and some other
packages, so maybe in the somewhat near-future it would be
possible to do a 3D feature. What I find really lacking is
an all-in-one motion capture rig that could really allow
for virtual acting. Right now you can capture either body
movements or facial movements, but not both at the same
time along with audio... and the facial capture I've seen
hasn't been as detailed as I would like (i.e. no eye movement
capture) in order to make closeups lifelike looking. So it
seems most of the animation still requires a bunch of slow
hand tweaking and it still doesn't look quite right.
