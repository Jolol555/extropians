<p>
In terms of mortality, I would think so.  The overwhelming portion of medical 
care
<br>
I and my family have recieved has been directed at disability, discomfort, or 
even
<br>
appearance (orthodontics).  In terms of improvements to my life expectancy I
suspect most of the benefit comes from my childhood vaccinations to smallpox,
diptheria, polio, german measles, and whooping cough.  I think that would be
less than $100.

<p>
<a href="0078.html#0085qlink3">&gt;Sure we are lots healthier now than in the past.  The question is how much</a><br>
<i>&gt;credit medicine deserves for that.  Lots of other things have changed besides</i><br>
<i>&gt;medicine.</i><br>

<p>
That's why I picked those.  Gangrene and appendicitis still have nearly 100%
mortality if not treated.  Pneumonia is generally survivable by the young but 
</a>
still often lethal if not treated.

<p>
<a name="0087qlink1"><a href="0078.html#0085qlink4">&gt;&gt;That sounds like a biased sample.  People who die within six months are</a><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;won't show up in the sample.  Am I missing something?</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0078.html#0085qlink5">&gt;I gave the URL for it - take a look for yourself: </a><br>
<i>&gt;<a href="http://nberws.nber.org/papers/W6513">http://nberws.nber.org/papers/W6513</a></i><br>

<p>
The abstract doesn't answer my questions; the paper has to be paid</a> for.
I wouldn't expect survival from a specific cause to be related to 
last-six-months
<br>
spending; treated survivors are excluded while patients with other disease
are included.  So you have a lot more noise and a lot less signal even for
a real affect.<a name="0181qlink3">  Statistical significance is a real problem with medical 
studies;
</a>
<br>
some require hundreds of thousands of patients.  Reducing signal/noise
ratio increases the necessary sample size by the square of the ratio change.
Even for heart disease, mortality is less that 30% and proportion of medical
costs less than a third so the ratio is about 10:1  That would drive the 
number
<br>
of deaths needed into the tens of millions and that's too much even for a 
countrywide survey.

<p>
My concern with excluding survivors remains.  The most effective medical
treatments result in nearly 100% survivability (e.g. gangrene, appendicitis,
and pneumonia in the young).  Hence the measurement by definition 
excludes patients for whom medical treatment is highly effective.

<p>
(from the abstract)
<br>
<i>&gt;regional survival rates following acute conditions like AMI (heart attacks), </i><br>
stroke, &gt;and gastrointestinal bleeding were not correlated with more 
intensive health care &gt;spending.

<p>
I don't know about GI bleeding, but I'd kind of expect that for AMI and 
stroke.  
<br>
There really aren't any treatments for stroke yet - some marginal improvements
with thrombolytics in a few percent of patients, and that's it.  For AMI, 
there's
<br>
thrombolytics (which are cheap), nitroglycerin and heparin (which are very 
cheap)
<br>
and coronary bypass (which is universal in those cases where it improves 
mortality).  So any excess spending necessarily goes to things of no proven,
and probably little, mortality benefit.
