<i>&gt; Who would have suspected the uncertainty principle prior to this century?</i><br>

<p>
I entirely disagree.  These things aren't limits.  Laws, maybe, but not
limits.  This century's history has been the history of people realizing
that so-called "limits" had been obviously bankrupt from the beginning. 
100 years CRNS (current-rate no-Singularity) from now, everyone will be
laughing at us for believing in the lightspeed limit when there was
General Relativity, wormholes, Warp-Tardis Drive...

<p>
<a name="3722qlink2">As for the uncertainty principle, despite the name, it isn't a limit on
knowledge.  Not at all.  It describes a very specific process known as
state-vector reduction which randomizes certain quantities at a certain
point in time.  This process, in turn, has all kinds of interesting
potential - including an apparent FTL propagation, come to think of it. 
Calling it a "limit" is abusing the term, if you ask me.  I say it's a tool.</a>

<p>
<a name="3722qlink3"><a href="3653.html#3681qlink2">&gt; Everyone seems to be ignoring Anders' post of a proof that wormholes can't</a><br>
<i>&gt; exist.  The current state of play is that there ain't no such animals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can't use the discovery of the wormhole concept as evidence for</i><br>
<i>&gt; breaking through limitations, if wormholes are impossible.</i><br>

<p>
What, the circular temporal loop of virtual particles?  That's only if
you have a closed timelike line, isn't it?  My understanding is that you
*can* build those with wormholes but you don't *have* to.  Besides, I
don't think the Tardis drive used wormholes.</a>

<p>
<a name="3722qlink4"><a href="3653.html#3681qlink3">&gt; All the universe guarantees us is that life and intelligence is possible.</a><br>
<i>&gt; That must be true or we would not be here.  There are no guarantees</i><br>
<i>&gt; beyond that.  The universe may be friendly or unfriendly, malleable or</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficult to manipulate.  We only know what we have learned, and there</i><br>
<i>&gt; is no basis for guessing that future discoveries will fall into one</i><br>
<i>&gt; category or the other.</i><br>

<p>
Actually, my position that all laws are malleable isn't based on an
Extropian morality; it's based on my ontological belief that "laws" are
actually "stuff".  Anything real can be modified; if laws are real, they
can be modified.  A rigid, Turing-like distinction between "program" and
"content", or "rules" and "cells", starts getting you into the same
paradoxes that made me a noncomputationalist in the first place.</a>
