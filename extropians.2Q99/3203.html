What you originally said was:
<br>
<a href="2927.html#3203qlink2">&gt;remember the dead </a><br>
<i>&gt;Japanese tourist who broke down on the highway and walked up to a home to </i><br>
<i>&gt;call for help, Oops!! -- he thought "Freeze" meant "please" ?) </i><br>

<p>
Which was very different from the truth; I suspect your comment about him
not understanding 'Freeze' is equally as incorrect. As far as I'm aware,
he continued to advance on someone who was pointing<a name="3205qlink1"> a .44 magnum revolver
at him until the guy decided that he must be a lunatic and shot him. Any
<a name="3207qlink1">moderately intelligent person should be able to work out that when you
have a huge great gun pointed at you it's a real bad idea to keep moving
towards the person who's holding it.
