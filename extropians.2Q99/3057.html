<a name="3067qlink1">How about something a little broader?  If the goal is simply
to get flamefests off the list, a separate exi-politics list
could help.  The problem isn't guns, it's the politics of
guns, and the politics of property, of race, etc.</a>

<a name="3067qlink2">If the goal is to only get gun-related flamefests off the
list and perhaps engender some good discussion of other
defense technologies and strategies, exi-defense would
be a good candidate.</a>

<p>
<a name="3067qlink3">In any case, I'm skeptical that creation of another list
will do much to get rid of flamefests on this list.  There
are already many other places to discuss politics and guns.
However, both sides feel a need to address opposing
arguments wherever they appear.  Someone will make
statements about guns on this list again, and the opposing
side will attempt to address those statements on this
list, lest some lurker get the wrong impression and think
there is no opposition.  The only change will be that
pressure to stop will consist of "I'm sick of this, go to
the guns/politics list" rather than today's "I'm sick of
this, go someplace else".</a>
