We could think in terms of a number of "memetic fields."
For convenience, all religious memes could be grouped
together as a "religious memetic field." Similarly, we
could think of a "poverty/wealth meme field," and the
same for "individual power/impotence," "freedom/slavery,"
health/illness," etc. Pemes = political memes. We can
also think of a "peme field."

In order to achieve what I call "level-3 freedom"
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/resplev.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/resplev.htm</a>&gt;, in my opinion, it's
necessary to become a "memetic/ontological individualist."
Ontology refers to the philosophy of what exists.

<p>
The "memetic/ontological collectivist" believes in the
reality of all kinds of "collective entities" and "social
organisms." The mental mechanisms that result in such
beliefs have been explored in '#TL05AB: ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND
RELATED PHENOMENA' &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl05ab.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl05ab.htm</a>&gt;,

NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic Political Illusion Complex. NSPIC
essentially consists of the pemes in individual minds that
result in destructive political behavior. They also tend
to make the individual less powerful in dealing with the
coercive political behavior of others. NSPIC could also
be called "the peme field." See:

<i>&gt;A Field of Memes would consist not only of a set of persons in relatively</i><br>
<i>&gt;contiguous geographical areas with similar "meme" or idea complexes, but a</i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanism of meme broadcasting or meme reinforcement/meme defense operated</i><br>
<i>&gt;by a "ruling class" working through a "government" and/or other institutions</i><br>
<i>&gt;of influence and/or coercion [religions, businesses, Foundations,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Universities, Think Tanks, Secret Societies, Prestige Organizations, etc].</i><br>

<p>
The person who has achieved level-3 freedom has cleared
all negative pemes (essentially those that put the individual
at a political disadvantage) from his or her mind. He or
she regards the notion that so-called "social organisms"
exist as ontological illusions. It may be convenient for
efficient speech to sometimes talk of "society," while
recognizing that so-called "society" has no ontological
reality.

<p>
<i>&gt;The ruling class is a "special commanding/co-ordinating organ" of the social</i><br>
<i>&gt;organism, much as the brain is a special "commanding/co-ordinating organ" of</i><br>
<i>&gt;a biological organism.  Some parts of  the "ruling class" function might be</i><br>
<i>&gt;conscious, but the vast majority of ruling class social organic functions</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be unconscious, the unintended consequence of political and economic</i><br>
<i>&gt;competition among individuals. As A-albionic Research has been saying for</i><br>
<i>&gt;a decade or two:  "Conspiracy theory is a heuristic approach to social</i><br>
<i>&gt;organism theory."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<br>
It's useful to think of "masters" and "slaves." "Masters"
could be regarded as those who command the "forces of
coercion"; "slaves" as those at the effect of the "forces
of coercion."

<p>
For speech convenience it may sometimes be useful to
<a name="1406qlink1">collectively refer to "masters" as "the ruling class."
</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;But, memes are to social organisms (cultures) as genes are to biological</i><br>
<i>&gt;organism.</i><br>

<p>
In order to achieve level-3 freedom, the above needs to
be rejected. The "memetic/ontological individualist"
thinks in terms of "Memes are to the mind as genes are
to the body."

<p>
<i>&gt;Genes spead primarily not by infecting other organisms "virally"</i><br>
<i>&gt;though they are, in fact, similar to viruses, but by directing its</i><br>
<i>&gt;biological organism toward survival and reproduction, thereby, replicating</i><br>
<i>&gt;itself. Memes spread in a similar way: they direct the social organism to</i><br>
<i>&gt;spread and reproduce through war, Colonialism, and Imperialism.</i><br>

<p>
The "level-3 memetic/ontological individualist" thinks in
terms of: The pemes in individual minds direct them to
think in ways that result in behaviors that maintain,
reinforce, perpetuate, and propagate the illusion of
so-called "social organisms" and the behaviors that
result from individuals clinging to such illusions.

<p>
<i>&gt;Only very rarely do memes spread to an alien culture and make the alien</i><br>
<i>&gt;culture part of the original culture or social organism.  I suppose the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"viral" spread of memes through unorganized humans might occasionally</i><br>
<i>&gt;enlarge a human culture, but, normally, the means in military conquest</i><br>
<i>&gt;fueled by "militaristic memes" in the "memetic field" of the original</i><br>
<i>&gt;culture.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<br>
There are certain negative pemes (such as the word
"government") and negative memes (such as the notion
of "cooking" food -- '#TL09 - HOW TO ACHIEVE SUPERHEALTH'
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl09.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl09.htm</a>&gt;) that practically
all humans all over the world suffer from.
