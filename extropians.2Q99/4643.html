Before I moved from a city with lots of cheap arty cinemas to one with no
cinema worth visiting, some months I'd average one movie a day. I thought
The Matrix was the best Hollywood movie I've seen in a long time, though
I love Hong Kong action movies so that goes a long way towards explaining
why; the script pretty much sucked, but visually it was great. The main
problem was that they started from a good premise (reality as computer
simulation) but didn't take it anywhere near as far as they could; I was
expecting some kind of Dickian 'what's real anyway?' story rather than 
just an action movie.
