<a href="0212.html#0244qlink1">&gt; would it be possible to subscribe to the list as an observer? I'm saying</a><br>

<a name="0252qlink1">I'd like to add that I appreciate that some specialized lists are indeed
useful, and I'm not necessarily arguing against the formation of this list
of Eliezer's.  But, I sincerely hope that there is some way for the rest of
us to at least access the archive or lurk or something (can I sign up if I
promise never to post?).</a>  Seriously, I worry a bit that those who have
something substantive to contribute to the singularity dialogue (me not
being in that number) will not be inclined to repeat or rephrase their
postings to the Extropian's list and we lose the benefit of their insights.
Some may feel that the singularity is too important a topic on this list for
the bulk of it to suddenly be transfered to a restricted list.  By the same
token, I know Eliezer wants to share some ideas with a very limited audience
and I respect that.  What's the solution?  Comments appreciated.
