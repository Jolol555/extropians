"What about sonar? I have always wanted to have 360 degree sonar to give
a sense of the surroundings. It could even be mapped onto the skin,
making the surroundings touch you ("A comfortable little office you
have...")."

A fascinating and attractive idea.  Because I ride my bicycle on the
street often, and because I have frequently been reminded of the fact
that large numbers of motorists drive as though I am not there, I have
often longed for this ability.  But, like always, I must make do with
what I have, so I have spent a lot of time developing my sense of hearing
and my ability to generate a rough model of my surroundings based on
auditory information.  Now when I hear cars around me, I have a very good
idea of where they are, how fast they are moving and which direction they
are moving in.  I have avoided many dangerous situations because of this.

I think it is important to develop the abilities we already have and
utilize them more fully .  We are not ready for new abilities if we do
not know how to take greater advantage of existing abilities.
