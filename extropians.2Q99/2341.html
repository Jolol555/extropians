My design was built from two Super Soaker water guns mounted on a common
trigger. We powered the 'beams' with 30 kV pulsed DC - similar to a
standard stun gun. At the best range I got, I was able to reliably light a
neon lamp at three feet before the streams began to lose 'coherency' and
break into droplets. Pretty wimpy.

<p>
Another outfit - Jaycor - (they're on the web) has patented a 'water
cannon' that uses a single stream - that's why I stopped development, aside
from the range problem. They also show a person with a GROUNDED SHOE firing
a single stream - that would have been educational if the shooter lifted
that foot while firing...

<p>
I have a feeling this particular device will either turn out to be
unworkable, or will be relegated to the same fate as the laser blinding
weapons developed a few years back by the military. Or perhaps this can be
useful in any totalitarian government's bag of tricks - we know who they
are...
