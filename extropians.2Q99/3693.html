Beckstropians,

<p>
	It is only fitting that as the sun sets on the gun debate, as we near the
midnight of our discontent, the topic should turn to guns and bars/alcohol.

<p>
Mark of the Unicorn says:

<p>
<a href="3555.html#3693qlink1">&gt;You know, I've never, ever seen more Uzis and M-16s in one place than in</a><br>
Israeli bars.
<br>
<a href="3555.html#3693qlink2">&gt;Somehow they seem to survive OK drinking alcohol while carrying</a><br>
fully-automatic military
<br>
<a href="3555.html#3693qlink3">&gt;weapons, whereas in many parts of America you would go to jail for</a><br>
carrying any gun into a
<br>
<a href="3555.html#3693qlink4">&gt;bar; one can only assume that Israelis trust each other a lot more than</a><br>
Americans do. 

<p>
Or perhaps we could simply observe that the Israelis and Swiss possess
their weapons in the context  of their well organized militias being
necessary to the security of their free states.

<p>
How cumzit no one on either side of the gun debate seems to mention that
prefatory phrase in the second ammendment?  Or at least it wasn't mentioned
in "our" "debate".  Ah, well.  I guess with the moratorium on gun posts
I'll probably never find out.  Just as well.  Won't change anything. 

<p>

<p>
Walk home?  Take a taxi?

<p>
I wonder who the last weasel will be to post to this thread, before the
Cincinnatus-imposed ceasefire goes into effect.  I can just imagine them
all out there, poised with their fingers over the "send" button, as the
clock ticks down to midnight.  If ever there was a group that needed
transhuman enhancement, they (we?) is it.

<p>
Joe Dees and Mike Lorrey sitting in a two seat outhouse.  One of 'em gets
up to leave (I'll never say which one), and as he's hikin' up his pants,
some coins fall out of his pocket and tumble into the blackness.  He
promptly takes out his wallet, extracts a twenty, and tosses it in after
the coins.  His fellow businessman--the one still seated--looks up,
flabbergasted, and says, "What'd ya do that for?"  To which he recieves his
reply:

<p>
"I've got a 160 IQ.  I'm a buttress against stupidity.  You don't think I'm
goin' in there for thirty-five cents, do ya?"

<p>
According to my clock it's 12:54 PM, New Hampshire time.   He he he. 
<p>
			Best, Jeff Davis
