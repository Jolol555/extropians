"Reality: Abundance, not scarcity, best describes the world's food supply.
Enough wheat, rice and other grains are produced to provide every human being
with 3,500 calories per day. That doesn't even count many other commonly eaten
foods - vegetables, beans, nuts, root crops, fruits, grass-fed meats, and fish.
Enough food is available to provide at least 4.3 pounds of food per person a day
worldwide: 2 ½ pounds of grain, beans and nuts, about a pound of fruits and
vegetables, and nearly another pound of meat, milk and eggs - enough to make
most people fat! The problem is that many people are too poor to buy readily
available food. Even most "hungry countries" have enough food for all their
people right now. Many are net exporters of food and other agricultural
products." See  <a href="http://www.foodfirst.org/pubsabs.htm#wohuco">http://www.foodfirst.org/pubsabs.htm#wohuco</a>

<p>
The problem then is that some people do not have the right pieces of paper
(money) to buy food. If these people do not get food through charitable means
they become losers under the current rules of the game of life (death through
starvation). Changing the rules (politics) has never stopped this problem, but
just made different winners and losers. That is why Buckminster Fuller
<a href="http://209.196.135.250/">http://209.196.135.250/</a> sought a solution through a game where political
solutions to world tangible need shortages were disallowed. There are solutions
through proficient use of current resources to allot of human problems (new
technologies are need to solve the rest).
