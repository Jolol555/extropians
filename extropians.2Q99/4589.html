Here's my list of people whose work or life influenced me toward extropian 
thinking and values in my early years:

<p>
<a name="4653qlink1">Arthur Clarke (most important personal impact, ages 11-14)
<br>
- Clarke has to be at the top of my list, if for no other reason that 2001: A <br>
Space Odyssey.  There's a passage in the book -- which I read and which 
completely blew me away when it was first published -- that is as clear and 
poetic a description of technotranscendance and total automorphism as one can 
find anywhere.  Anders has posted my quotation of this passage and some 
</a>comments on it at:

<p>
Jacques-Yves Cousteau (most important personal impact, ages 8-12)
<br>
- Cousteau's use of technology to extend his own and humanity's reach into a <br>
new environment and his personal energy, fearlessness, curiosity, breadth of 
vision, grace and expressiveness exemplified what I eventually came to 
realize were a pretty full set of extropian values.

<p>
Carl Sagan (most important personal impact, age 17-20)
<br>
- Sagan's poetic cosmic vision kept me passionately interested in our destiny <br>
in space in the long drought after Viking.

<p>
Buckminster Fuller (most important personal impact, age 14-18)
<br>
- Fuller showed me that one could create an integrated personal futurist <br>
vision that combined humanism and technology.

<p>
Paolo Soleri (most important personal impact, age 16-18)
<br>
- Soleri introduced me to the concept of mega-scale engineering.<br>

<p>
Leonardo da Vinci (most important personal impact, age 9-14)
<br>
- da Vinci was like a proto-Fuller and made me comfortable with the idea of <br>
being an individual with a humanist vision of worlds not yet realized.

<p>
Robert Heinlein (most important personal impact, age 9-16)
<br>
- Heinlein's work showed me the many textures of how individuals, technology <br>
and society can fit together.

<p>
Ayn Rand (most important personal impact, age 16-18)
<br>
- Rand opened up the whole world of radical individualism for me.<br>

<p>
Aldous Huxley (most important personal impact, age 16-20)
<br>
- Huxley opened up the doors of perception for me.<br>

<p>
Timothy Leary (most important personal impact, age 16-19)
<br>
- Leary put a sense of humor on Huxley.<br>

                  progress requires us to take control of evolution."
                                      -- Thomas Huxley
