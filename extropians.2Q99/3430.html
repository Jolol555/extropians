arising in reconfigurable architectures apart from the fab process
physics itself. Let's shift the complexity load to the software, 
where it belongs.</a>

<a href="3365.html#3430qlink2"> &gt; by changing design methodologies, but I think we're starting to hit the end </a><br>

<a name="3512qlink2">Wintel has done a desastrous job. It has perpetuated and cemented an
insanely braindead way of doing things (not even inventing it: that
blame goes to Big Blue), and yet people praise it for all the 
innovation they introduced.</a> Bah, humbug. I can only hope the stalled
progress will suddenly give to a breathtaking wave of innovation. All
the ideas are there already.<a name="3512qlink3"> It is just nobody is willing to take the
risks, since new technologies are expensive.</a>

<i> &gt; particular technical reason for the new chips, so maybe they can drop them </i><br>
<i> &gt; and push the 80x86 up to multi-gigahertz clock rates.</i><br>
 
<p>
<a name="3512qlink4">Oh, but there is. These gate delays add up after a while. One needs to 
streamline/radically simplify the architecture to go to higher clock
rates. Structure shrink alone can't do it forever, you know.</a>

only truly innovative hardware design I am currently aware of. The 
Xilinx people need some watching, as well.

<p>
<a href="3365.html#3430qlink4"> &gt; &gt;but we'll still see an actual steepening of the performance/price curve</a><br>

<i> &gt; I agree, and I think we'll see a reversal of Intel's attempts to do </i><br>

<p>
<a name="3512qlink6">There is no need to go dedicated. If there are hundreds or thousands
identical CPUs in each desktop there is sufficient horsepower to do 
anything in software.</a> God, we can do embedded RAM now. Nonvolatile 
core is a the threshold of viability, including for reconfigurable logic
purposes. Let's dump code bloat and go WSI.<a name="3512qlink7"> There is a lot of silicon
real estate out there on these 300 mm wafers. And quantitive yield can 
do wonders to prices.
