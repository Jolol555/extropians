First off, please stop hiding behind other identities. An honest
debating opponent does not hide behind shrouds of anonymity, unless they
have ulterior motives.

<p>
Making property rights for individuals non-existent would allow
socialists and socialist sympathisers to seize upon any property or
resource under the claim that it is for 'the common good'. They could
gain great personal wealth for themselves hidden by a socialist
authority and may reproduce by large quantities, however, the resultant
losses in economic growth due to stifled invention, public morale, and
personal enmity of all freedome loving persons for such oppressors will
eventually bring about instability and revolution, which frequently
(according to the mortality statistics for political leaders) will
result in their deaths and the deaths of their families. While there may
be a short term advantage, there is no long term advantage, which is
what evolution lends greater weight to.
