 Researchers report cloning genetically engineered goats 

<p>
BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts researchers say they have cloned three 
goats that are genetically altered to produce a protein in their milk 
that might be used to treat heart attack and stroke victims. 

<p>
The cloning could mean faster and less expensive production of the 
protein, Antithrombin III, which has the potential to treat heart 
attacks and strokes and prevent blood clots. It is now being tested 
on humans. 

<p>
The cloned goats were born last fall on a farm in Charlton, the Tufts 
University School of Veterinary Medicine and [ Genzyme Transgenics 
Corp. ] of Framingham said Monday. 

<p>
"The results could revolutionize the biopharmaceutical industry," <br>
said Eric Overstrom, a developmental biologist at the Tufts 
veterinary school. 

<p>
"We now have a method that is a faster, reliable and more cost-<br>
 way to produce complex pharmaceuticals for humans and 
animals." 

<p>
Currently, methods of producing human proteins for drugs include 
growing them in yeast and taking them from pooled human blood -- 
expensive, risky and low-yield methods, Overstrom said. 

<p>
The work is reported in the May 1 issue of Nature Biotechnology. 

<p>
Transgenics is the process of implanting genes from one species into 
the DNA of another. It is used to put human genes into animals so 
they will develop human diseases. 

<p>
The researchers also came up with a way to use fewer eggs to produce 
a cloned animal. 

<p>
It took 140 eggs to produce the first cloned goat, using an older 
method. But the two other cloned goats, twins, were created with only 
92 eggs by using "activated" eggs that were tricked into thinking 
they had been fertilized. 

<p>
"Layering the cloning on top of the transgenics (gene-altering) work <br>
is important in getting the therapeutic proteins to the patients in 
the most efficient manner possible," said Sandra Nusinoff Lehrman, 
president and chief executive officer of Genzyme. 

<p>
"The cloning allows you, once you've got the cell line, to much more <br>
efficiently develop your herd." 

<p>
She believes there is a $200 million-a-year market for Antithrombin 
III in Europe, where it is used more than in this country. 

<p>
The cloning produces female goats, and goats have a gestation period 
of only five months and produce plenty of milk. 

<p>
The first cloned animal was a sheep born in Scotland in 1996.
