I'd be very suprised if any reasonable study has been done.

<p>
Seems like a good opportunity for a grant proposal...nice tight population
with great economic/educational characteristics.
I'm sure it's unlikely that the medical community would want to see the
study done, but i'm guessing that the sponsors of the msa bill in congress
would love to see it.

<p>
<a href="0182.html#0213qlink3">&gt;Btw, the main problem with MSAs in practice is price discrimination.</a><br>
The average actual hospital bill is about 1/4 of the list price charged
to folks that just walk in the door.  Group purchasing is essential to get
a low price, but most MSA folks don't get group prices.

<p>
I actually get discounts thru my MSA and the ALLIED health group and they
are INDEED very helpful.
<br>
My MSA is with Golden Rule.

<p>
By the way, in my case it is incontrovertable that the $3,500 deductable has
"influenced" my medical consuption behaviour. I have lost 30 lbs, eat very
little meat, sugar, or fat, have a 21% BMI fat index, very low cholesterol,
reduced wrinkles, added hair reversed many pains to subclinical levels, and
have become vastly more knowledgeable about how my body works
biomechanically, hormonally, emotionally, genomically, and molecularly. I
consider the deductable to be tuition to earn the right to live long and
prosper. For two years I have had zero need to see a doctor. I am only now
considering seeing a LEF vetted MD in order to get some baseline data for
the long haul

If I can't live 10,000 years what's the point?
