<a name="0755qlink1"><a name="0752qlink1">Having two genders is an important part of the survival strategy</a> for many
<a name="0752qlink2">species.  Our biology and psychology is well-adapted to this</a> the two-gender
survival strategy.

<p>
<a name="0792qlink1"><a name="0752qlink3">Moving humans to a single gender for both sexes could have</a> a long-term
impact on the survivability of the species.  After all, every aspect of
both genders is extremely useful under some circumstance.  Having two
genders allows a species to embody multiple conflicting characteristics,
which appears to be a strategy to maximize adaptability; to a certain
extent, differences between cultures would seem to be a manifestion of a
<a name="0752qlink4">selection process among the large number of characteristics</a> found across
both genders.

</a>

<p>
<a name="0752qlink5">Cultural artifacts such as patriarchy and matriarchy would then</a> seem to
demonstrate selection for attributes that are closely tied to gender.  A
change in the selection pressures among the two genders will inevitably
<a name="0752qlink6">change the culture as well, and I think history is full</a> of examples of
this.  For example, civilizations that are becoming increasingly dependant
on skill specialization have decreased the value of some male-specific
characteristics that can probably be linked to most patriarchal cultures.
<a name="0752qlink7">IMO, skill specialization has done more to decrease the amount of
patriarchy in Western civilization than any other factor</a> by selecting for
<a name="0752qlink8">attributes that are common to both genders.  However,</a> future evolutionary
<a name="0752qlink9">pressures may lead to cultures that are (necessarily?)</a> strongly female or
<a name="0752qlink10">male dominant.
