<i>&gt;  depressed.</i><br>

<p>
I beg to differ.

<p>
<a name="1474qlink1">Some months ago I made a post concerning the Atkins diet...(hi protein...low 
carbohydrate)...it was met with considerable derision.</a>

<p>
Consequently I did a little research.  

<p>
There is another doctor who has done similar investigations.  He has also 
written a book.  It's entitled "Protein Power" by Drs. Eades (husband and 
wife)...

<p>
Url = <a href="http://www.eatprotein.com/">http://www.eatprotein.com/</a>

<p>
There is atkins as mentioned..

<p>
There is another dr. whose book I haven't read yet...his title is called "The 
Zone"...

<p>
<a name="1474qlink2">What I've gleaned from all of this is summarized in the Eades book. 

<p>
 Briefly he says that for ten thousand generations man was a meat eater who 
supplimented his diet with ocassional veggies...(Hunter Gatherer)...then the 
agricultural revolution occured and our nutritional problems began.</a>

<p>
He supports this by talking extensively about the egyptians.(also a great 
number of footnotes and a bibliography)  It seems significant information can 
be gathered by examining egyptian mummies of which there a suprisingly large 
number.  Supposedly the egyptians had many of the same problems we 
do....(heart disease...obesity...etc etc).....which their predescessors (the 
hunter gathers.......) did not..

<p>
I suggest that anyone interested read Dr. Eades book.

<p>
Oh..by the way...it works.

<p>
I'm down to 225 from 280...in several months... And when I eat carbohydrates 
(except for beer...which is where I get almost all of the carbs I eat...and 
then I go to sleep)...I feel bad..

<p>
My normal diet is eggs...steak...milk....cheese...all the bad things.(and 
beer of course..but I try to be moderate)


<p>
My brother is on a similar diet...with similar results.  He has more money 
than I have as well as access to medical services I don't.  He's had his 
blood composition monitored.  Such things as triglycerides...cholesterol 
levels...and things I've no clue as to what they are...have all improved  
considerably.

<p>
Of course...youre milage may vary..
