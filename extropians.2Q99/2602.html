I learned to type on a dvorak layout (before qwerty) and found it rather
easy.  The keyboard I used was a qwerty so I has to learn to type without
looking at the keys.  Opinions vary as to whether this helps or hinders
learning.  

<p>
Since going to college I switched to qwerty because of the large amount of
time spent at public machines.  That was annoying.  I typed faster using
the dvorak keyboard than I do with the qwerty, but I also did a lot more
typing using dvorak than I have done with qwerty.  My fingers also have to
move a lot more, but that is a well documented side effect of qwerty.
