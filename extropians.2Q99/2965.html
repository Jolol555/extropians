<a href="2929.html#2965qlink1">&gt; Just a little tidbit i dug up...now tell me again how our government is so </a><br>
<i>&gt; smart...(so smart it can tell us who can or can not own guns... or who can or </i><br>
<i>&gt; can not make other decesions...) and that we should respect it and know that </i><br>
<i>&gt; it holds our best interest at heart...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; According to the March 14, 1999, edition of Doug Fiedor’s newsletter Heads </i><br>
<i>&gt; Up, the IRS publishes 480 tax forms and 280 forms to explain them, sending </i><br>
<i>&gt; out eight billion pages of forms and instructions each year which, if laid </i><br>
<i>&gt; end to end, would circle the earth 28 times. Nearly 300,000 trees are cut </i><br>
<i>&gt; down each year to produce the paper on which IRS forms and instructions are </i><br>
<i>&gt; printed. Each year, Americans devote 5.4 billion hours complying with the tax </i><br>
<i>&gt; code, which is more time than it takes to build every car, truck and van </i><br>
<i>&gt; produced in the United States. The cost of complying with the tax system </i><br>
<i>&gt; totals about $200 billion annually, or $700 for every person in America. The </i><br>
<i>&gt; corporate income tax costs the economy more in lost production than it raises </i><br>
<i>&gt; in revenue for the Treasury. Dale Jorgenson, the chairman of the Economics </i><br>
<i>&gt; Department at Harvard University, found that each extra dollar the government </i><br>
<i>&gt; raises through the current system costs the economy $1.39.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Doug gives details of a bill before Congress for replacing this monstrosity </i><br>
<i>&gt; with a flat tax of 17% on all income, with a family of four paying no tax on </i><br>
<i>&gt; the first $35,400 of their income. This is from the same newsletter that was </i><br>
<i>&gt; talking about the sellout of strategic defense technology to China a year </i><br>
<i>&gt; before the general media picked it up. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
What does the one have to do with the other?  So there exists a 
blosted bureaucracy.  That doesn't mean that the results of court 
cases and competency hearings cannot be sent to a single 
accessible file.  In fact, with today's technology, the creation and 
maintainence of such a registry should be surpassingly simple.
