<i>&gt; states, and are going to pass in others.  In this case, public </i><br>
<i>&gt; opinion is leading rather than following the politicians.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Are you sure? From what I've seen, there is a large majority of people in
the western world still cerebrally-flatlined and drooling like the day they
first heard the ubiquitous but meaningless word "drugs". Armed with an
opportunity for easy self-righteousness they blather on about how people
"should not do drugs.....", cos "drugs are baaad"....etc.
For public opinion to be based on reality, not "tell me what to think"
drivel is a welcome change for the better! Legal grass here we come!</a>
