I recently posted here (ExI's "LawNode" mail list) an inquiry concerning the 
Mars Society and its "Law and Governance Task Force".  I received one 
private, off-list reply that proved to be quite prophetic in characterizing 
the Mars Society as being essentially a "Kim Stanley Robinson fan club", with 
all that that implies about a statist willingness to engage in authoritarian 
social engineering.  I posted a neutral inquiry to the Mars Society list a 
week or so ago, asking about general attitudes there regarding central 
planetary-scale control, and the role of the state in the kinds of Martian 
settlement envisioned there.  Not surprisingly, the focus of the discussion 
was the "Martian Constitution" featured in the Robinson novels.  The 
following is a post I sent to the Mars Society law and governance list this 
morning:

Rather than responding in detail to each of the interesting posts regarding a 
possible Martian constitution (a task that would take all day, I'm afraid), 
I'll offer my observations here in thematic terms.

<p>
First, the physical circumstances under which Martian political entities 
would be formed will obviously strongly influence their character.  Will 
colonies be heavily dependant on Earth for resupply, or will they be largely 
able to support themselves?  Will Mars offer resources to Earth that will be 
considered strategically important to Terran governments?  How easy will 
immigration be in physical terms?  Will Martian political entities be created 
in a technological milieu that creates a significant economic surplus, or 
will colonists at that time be largely concerned with simple physical 
survival and will they consist largely only of the technicians necessary to 
support life at Mars?  And will early Martians be traditional humans at all, 
or will colonization only become a reality at a time when the human animal is 
subject to more or less complete biological reengineering?

<p>
The importance of each of these factors separately and all of them together 
should be obvious.  To look at just a few of these factors, consider that a 
Martian constitution formed by a small group of highly educated, largely 
technically- and scientifically-oriented people (perhaps made up in 
significant part by people with a military background) (i.e. the sort of 
people who currently characterize humanity's cadre of spacefarers), 
significantly dependant on a constant and expensive channel of resupply from 
Earth, would be very different from one formed by a larger, more diverse 
group of humans whose technology liberates them from economic dependance on 
Earth.

<p>
Consider that humans have maintained an outpost in Antarctica for three 
generations now but, except for relatively minor questions of local 
governance, have made no attempt to establish any sort of unique or 
independent cultural and political identity.  Contrast this with various 
groups of European colonists in the New World in a previous era: Able to 
support themselves and having reached a critical level of cultural breadth 
and self-sufficiency, they asserted independence and expressed a new 
synthesis of the elements of their cultural heritage.

<p>
I believe the bare physical circumstances of establishing a human presence at 
Mars provide limiting values for some of these parameters.  I am a space 
enthusiast (see: <a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch1/space.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch1/space.html</a>) and a near-extreme 
techno-optimist (see: <a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch2/scnrio1.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch2/scnrio1.html</a> and 
<a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch3/thext.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch3/thext.html</a>), but I try to also be a realist.  
Even if the most clever plans of the Mars Underground are realized, human 
presence at Mars will be a very limited and tenuous proposition with current 
and next-generation technologies.  Employing technologies I see as likely 
through 2020-2050, human outposts at Mars will be just that; scientific 
research installations very much like ones we now find at Antarctica.  There 
will only be two types of people at such installations: Scientists and 
technicians to support the scientists.  They will be employed nearly 100% of 
their time with the task of learning about Mars and staying alive, and they 
will be nearly completely dependant on costly resupply from Earth for crucial 
support for their survival.

<p>
To the extent that there will be a political element to the lives of these 
first-generation Martians, it will likely be more akin to the politics of a 
scientific institution or a high-tech military base than of a general 
parliament.  The first Martians will be more concerned with grant money than 
taxation and issues relating to plumbing supplies will probably predominate 
over questions of general human rights.  The cut-throat competition within 
academia and stereotypes of testosterone overload notwithstanding, PhDs and 
test pilots tend to be among the portion of the human population least in 
need of rules of governance, because they are self-selected and 
institutionally sifted for intelligence, cooperativeness and critical 
rationality.  Far more than the "First Hundred" will be further filtered in a 
way that ensures that few true political problems will arise at Mars that 
will require a real constitution.  

<p>
(A personal aside: I've known a few graduates of the U.S. Navy's nuclear <br>
submarine corp, both officers and enlisted men.  A more intelligent, 
well-educated, rational and cooperative lot it would literally be impossible 
to find, IMHO, because of the unique screening process to which they are 
subjected.  I believe they probably provide a good example of the kind of 
people we'll see in the "First Thousand").

<p>
All of this having been said, I do believe quite firmly that there will be a 
"population explosion" of immigration to Mars, perhaps as early as the first 
part of the second half of the 21st Century.  This will only be possible, 
however, once the technology for comfortable and secure self-sufficiency has 
been developed.  In my mind there is one key to this technology, the kind of 
advanced molecular nanotechnology (MNT) envisioned by Eric Drexler in his 
books "Engines of Creation" and "Nanosystems" (see: <a href="http://www.foresight.org">http://www.foresight.org</a>, 
a citation I'm sure I need not offer to this list). 

<p>
This opinion leads to the conclusion that we will not see a steady curve of 
socio-economic factors underlying Martian settlement.  Early scientific 
exploration by humans in situ will be just barely possible with the most 
clever engineering before MNT, and significant emigration to Mars and other 
extraterrestrial points will be relatively inexpensive once a "mature MNT" is 
developed.  This is a very different profile than was presented by the 
technological milieu of 16th-18th century technology and the settlement of 
the New World, where there were no significant discontinuities of settlement 
between the first explorers and the formation of new and independent 
polities.  In the historical experience, a slow, steady improvement of 
technology and growth of global trading infrastructure supported a steady 
stream of immigration to the New World and a fairly continuous development of 
colonial economic and cultural self-sufficiency and independence.

<p>
These points lead to some conclusions for me about the physical parameters 
that will influence the formation of the first real Martian (and other 
extraterrestrial) polities.  The first "government" at Mars will be extremely 
local and will concern the minutiae of life in small, isolated scientific and 
military  installations.  I imagine that the kind of ad-hoc democratic 
behavior characteristic of well-educated, rational modern people will 
generate a host of small "institutions" for the governance of things like 
duty rosters, assignment to hazardous activities and the consumption of rare 
and expensive "luxuries" like open living space and the occasional leisure 
activity of amateur entertainments and like.  To the extent that larger 
political and legal issues may arise, they will almost certainly be dealt 
with as such matters are dealt with now in similar circumstances, through a 
case-by-case application of "home country" laws and institutions.  (See, for 
instance how "flag" law is applied to ships at sea, a general military code 
of justice is applied in foreign military installations and general "home 
country" law is applied in offshore oil installations).  To the extent that 
minor property rights issues or the unlikely and exceedingly rare criminal 
issue might arise, the early scientific settlers would almost surely look to 
a case-by-case application of the laws of their home countries -- almost 
certainly through the mechanism of courts and governing bodies on earth.  (As 
much as I'd like to think that I could get an early ride on the strength of 
offering my legal services, I believe I'm more likely to represent an early 
Martian settler via telepresence, something I already do with my 
international clientele.)

<p>
A very different situation will be presented by the settlement of Mars with 
advanced molecular nanotechnology and a mature genetic science.  From a 
society characterized by tiny, isolated scientific installations, tens of 
thousands and then millions of people might descend on Mars, but with the 
technology to be independent from Earth and each other, except in terms of 
information.  I see this discontinuity as being not only possible but highly 
probable for reasons of simple economics: Before MNT, it will cost a lot to 
get to Mars and stay there and the only return on the investment will be 
scientific knowledge.  Mars is, by definition, at the bottom of a gravity 
well far from Earth.  The only reason to go there is to be there.  This will 
be true after a "nanotech revolution", with the only difference being the 
cost and ease of getting there and staying there.  So who will go to Mars 
after the development of MNT?  Two kinds of people: Tourists and "ideological 
settlers", people who want to leave Earth and start a new life for strong 
personal and philosophical reasons.

<p>
So I conclude that any real, distinct "Martian constitution" will almost 
certainly be formed in the physical circumstances of a recent overwhelming 
technological revolution and by people who move to Mars for two very 
different sets of reasons and ones not typical of the motivations of average 
citizens of Earth today: On the one hand (1) commerce in the form of (a) 
operators of resorts and "high-tech wilderness travel" businesses and (b) 
settler-oriented business (land speculation and development and 
infrastructure supply) and, on the other hand, (2) ideology in the form of 
<br>
(a) settlers intent on forming communities with specific ideological and <br>
philosophical identities and (b) high-tech hermits.

<p>
Now, what sort of polities might grow out of such physical circumstances?  
Let me first say that I have a lot of respect for Kim Stanley Robinson and 
his three books, especially for the depth of knowledge about Mars evidenced 
there.  But I have a fairly harsh judgment of the "futurology" upon which the 
books are based and the political ideas and projections that one finds in the 
story line.  I share the idea that there will be a sudden, large wave of 
settlement of extremely diverse types of people and that the greatest 
conflicts will center around terraforming.  However, as I try to explain 
above, the physical circumstances of the settlement of Mars will be very, 
very different from what Robinson projects.  IMHO, there is a near-zero 
probability that significant numbers of people could ever find themselves at 
Mars without the physical wherewithal to be self-sufficient and independent.  
Accordingly, given the wide disparity of motivations for emigration we will 
likely see, environmental issues seem to be essentially the only ones that 
would require any kind of planetary-scale governance.  Unless the early 
settlers in a post-nanotech era make the mistake of creating government for 
its own sake (which creates a group of people whose product is legislation), 
there will be no ECONOMIC constituency favoring planetary governance for any 
purpose other than regulating the planetary environment.

<p>
Some of the ideological settlers will very likely have a planetary-scale 
utopian vision they would seek to impose on all immigrants.  But there will 
likely be multiple such global ideologies, and just as many, if not more, of 
the ideological settlers will hold values antithetical to any kind of broad 
universal social construct.  In such a circumstance, it seems most probable 
that a minarchist polity would develop whose primary function would be to 
oppose any sort of attempt to establish a global social order.  Thus I see 
the most probable planetary constitution to be one which only prohibits 
inter-group use of force and establishes and maintains whatever global 
environmental consensus might be reached.  Given the economic independence 
possible with a mature molecular nanotechnology, I see very little chance 
that the diverse groups that will descend on Mars will accept anything more 
elaborate as a planetary government.

<p>
Having said all of this, I agree with Robinson that the knottiest problem 
will be questions arising from terraforming.  I find it unlikely that purist 
"Reds" will dominate the consensus that might be reached.  Only aerologists 
and the most extreme "wilderness aesthetes" would hold such a position and 
they will be in a tiny minority.  The vast majority of settlers will be 
fairly avid technophiles and adventurers, the kinds of people who are willing 
to "tinker with nature".  (The discovery of indigenous active life forms 
might influence this factor somewhat, though it seems unlikely that it would 
forestall significant terraforming for long.)

<p>
Given the diversity of settler motivations, it seems probable that diverse 
approaches to terraforming would likely develop, with multiple engineered 
ecologies growing outward from different settlements. This would give rise to 
challenges of social order the like of which we have never seen before and 
which might make the conflicts between ranchers and farmers in the settlement 
of the American West seem tame.  I will end this very long post by offering 
my own general view of how I think such conflicts would be best resolved.  
Given the complexity and unforeseeability of the development of a new and 
artificial planetary ecology, I think it is unlikely that a centralized 
planning bureau for terraforming could manage the process any better than an 
ad-hoc, "bottom-up" approach of multilateral spontaneous ordering.  In this 
respect, I commend Virginia Postrel's recent book, "The Future and Its 
Enemies" (see:<a href="http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/gbcurrent.html">http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/gbcurrent.html</a> and 
<a href="http://www.dynamist.com">http://www.dynamist.com</a>) as a view of how "local knowledge" and spontaneous 
social orders can provide satisfactory solutions to complex problems -- even 
ones as complex as managing the terraforming of Mars.
