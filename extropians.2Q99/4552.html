<a name="4590qlink1">    Just recently watched the Matrix (it came out two weeks ago in the UK).
After hearing all the noise about it on this list I was expecting to get a
lot out of this film.  I didn't.  As a film, it was awful.  It's concept of
style amounts to wearing sunglasses in the dark.  Although many of the
special effects scenes were excellent (when Neo emerges from the pod, the
effective use of still motion to show that Neo has been shot) the directing
was less than seamless, sometimes making the film difficult to watch.  The
first half-hour was almost painful as we went through the usual cool-hacker
crazy-friends routine.  At one point, when Morpheous began waxing
philosophical, I lost consciousness.  And then for some inexplicable reason
the submarine/spaceship/whatever had to be attacked by squids.  The whole
idea of a world where you can make things up as you go along is probably one
that should be avoided in future.

<p>
    If there were no good scenes and no good ideas in this film</a> it wouldn't
have been so bad. But there were at least two good scenes and one good idea,
and for that I hate it. The next film to make good use of still motion and
tackle more transhuman problems is going to make less of an impact because
of this.
