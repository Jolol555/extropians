Crusae is now being touted as a limited series; 12 episodes were made
before TNT pulled the plug.  The possibility exists that the showwill be
picked up for syndication as B5 was originally;  the SciFi Channel has
also expressed interest.

Problems arose when TNT tred to force changes (more sex &amp; violence) on a
show where the creator, J Michael Stracynski
(all hail!), had contractually been given complete creative control;
when he said no, the only leverage they had was to pull the plug.
Apparently someone actually said to him "You'll never work in this town
again!".  Of course, TNT is based in Atlanta, so this is fine with JMS.
