good, and figured they'd like a gander of getting goosed by the 
same slimestick themselves to see how the fuck it feels to be 
slandered by association with extremists.  It's simply karmic tit-for-

it's the people with the guns who are shooting everybody (always 
has been); they play this little "Shane" home movie in their heads 
about how they're righteous people pushed too far by bullying 
cliques, and the next thing you know, fifteen kids are lying dead</a> in 
school halls, and the gun lobby steps on its dick by claiming that if 
a guard had a gun he coulda stopped them when one did and 
couldn't, and Li'l Einstein Danny Quayle kisses Wayne LaPierre's 
ring by saying he hoped the massacre wasn't used as an excuse 
to restrict gun sales!  FUCK excuses; it's a goddamned REASON!  
Finally the Senate got a testicle transplant and put some 
safeguards on the criminal flea market gun shows where two of the 
guns were bought, and insists on safety locks so's if Junior nurses 
a carelessly left automatic and plays with the trigger, he won't get 
a lead lunch!  About Damned Time!
