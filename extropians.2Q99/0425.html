This is a bit silly.  Of course fabricators come in more than one size, and
the biggest ones will have to be assembled manually out of components small
enough to be built by fabricators.  But I'm not claiming that nanotech gives
us 100% automation - merely that it greatly reduces the complexity of our
industrial ecology.

<p>
That doesn't follow from your questions.  Of course we still need building
contractors, distribution systems, and all the other parts of the economy.
What we don't need is a hundred thousand different models of machinery
designed to perform different manufacturing steps on bulk matter.  The
fabricator that makes small electric motors is at least as automated as a
conventional factory that does the same thing, but it can just as easily
make can openers, plumbing supplies, light bulbs or sheet metal.

<p>
<a href="0372.html#0425qlink5">&gt; The matter-compiler could be simulated.  Instead of filling a volume of</a><br>

<i>&gt; fills a simulated space with simulated atoms, and puts the result on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; screen.  At the lowest level, you have simulated atomic positioners</i><br>
putting
<br>
<a href="0372.html#0425qlink6">&gt; simulated atoms into a pattern, and then there are higher levels where</a><br>
<i>&gt; larger systems coordinate the activities of the atomic positioners.  Then</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have the compiler that takes a high-level design and converts it into</i><br>
<i>&gt; low-level instructions.  Apparently you're a programmer, so you tell me --</i><br>
<i>&gt; how complex would this simulation be?  What would it be comparable to?</i><br>

<p>
That's a big programming job, but its feasible.  You wouldn't ever actually
simulate the whole thing at once - the task of making steel bar (for
instance) naturally decomposes into the task of filling a tiny volume of
space with a given pattern of atoms, and then repeating as necessary to get
the desired object.

<p>
Similar programs actually exist now, for converting CAD files into
instructions for teams of factory robots.  They are of limited usefulness
because you need different programs for different kinds of manufacturing
equipment, and its hard for the program to figure out whether it is actually
possible to make a given item with the equipment it "knows" about.

<p>
I'd guess that the whole process conversion process could be made completely
automated for the limited problem of making uniform bulk materials with a
nanotech fabricator.  Making biological materials, or objects with
nano-scale components, would be a much more difficult task.
