That's a pity. The current product is unfortunately not that good that one can 
buy it unseen. Thus informed choices are always better.

I thought _dying_ was the main problem. Which circumstances? Any. If I 
don't like, I can always commit suicide. What motivations? I don't
care, as long as I am reanimated. (If I'm not reanimated, I don't
really care either: I'm a really cool customer, since sitting in a
dewar). Goverments? I hope they won't have much say in the issue.

<p>
Point is, the odds are incalculable. I might as well live. If I'm
dead, I'm dead. That's an irreversible decision.

<p>
<a href="0594.html#0600qlink3"> &gt; I would really recommend reading "A world out of time" as a start (by</a><br>

<i> &gt; because you like good SF, if nothing else.</i><br>
 
<p>
Scary? So what. I can think of a billion scary scenarios. Who says
they'll come true?
 
<p>
<a href="0594.html#0600qlink4"> &gt; But if you want to know the technical details of implementing cryonics,</a><br>

<p>
Thanks, I'm doing just that.
