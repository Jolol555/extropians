carried flint-lock muzzle-loaders, when they were concerned with British
troops crashing down the front door, when armed combat was an honorable
<a name="2160qlink5"><a name="2155qlink2">affair.</a>  Unfortunately, the Second Amendment is one of the only Amendments
</a>
to the Constitution that has not properly stood the tests of time.</a>  It is
</a>
reasonable for a person to keep a gun in their home, but realize that there
</a>
<a name="2160qlink6">has been a surge of lawsuits involving would-be burglars suing home-owners
for damage inflicted upon them by firearms and knives.  There</a> are now legal
<a name="2160qlink7">precedents making it difficult for home-owners to maintain their right to
use their guns in the privacy of their own home.</a>  
</a>

<p>
<a name="2160qlink8"><a name="2155qlink3">The important thing to remember is that gun safety and gun control are
important; people should educate their children to respect and understand
guns, and efforts should be made to make it difficult to own a gun.  I
personally have no problem with people owning firearms, keeping them in
their homes.  But as soon as you hit the streets packing heat, you're a
potential threat to everyone around you.  The NRA's spokesmen and their
red-in-the-face, pry-it-from-my-cold-dead-fingers attitude is frightening,
fascist, and indicative of barbarism.  Personal security aside, you just
want to feel big and powerful.</a></a>
