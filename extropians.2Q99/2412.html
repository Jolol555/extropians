<a name="2479qlink1"><a name="2435qlink1">I have seen this attitude a lot over the past several months
(in myself too)... ideas pop up, seem wonderful, but the person
envisioning it does not have the wherewithal to just do it.
Seems that if there was some kind of company that would pay
people for ideas, and then use its resources to develop them
that it could really make some dough. Like Hollywood paying
writers for scripts- the writers don't make much cash, but
writing is what they love; the studios make all the $$$. Hmmm

<i>&gt; I never like playing one game for more than a few months.</i><br>
