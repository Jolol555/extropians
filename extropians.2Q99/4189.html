<p>
I had hoped that my posting in this thread would stimulate more
discussion of a three posts/day rule or other means of improving the
list rather than the merits of Gina Miller's news posts.  Alas...

<p>
On the topic of news posts, I'd prefer brief summaries/excerpts with
URLs (since most or all of the articles in question are readily
available and presumably taken from the web, though it does delight me
to see blatant copyright violation), and most importantly, commentary
from the poster.

<p>
In general I'd like to see posters put more thought into their
messages, whether those be news items or heated debate.  I liked the
three posts/day rule on the assumption that it might make some people
think "I can only make three posts today, I'd better make each one
good" rather than immediately firing off whatever one is itching to
send.  Probably a bad assumption.  Here are some other ideas:


<UL>
<a name="4279qlink1">  <li>  Everyone moderates their own posts.  After sending something to the
  list, the poster gets sent the same message back for approval, along
  with a preface explaining that all messages should be formatted
  nicely, civil, not excessively long (provide a URL instead), not
  overquote and by the way have you read FAQs x, y, and z lately?  If
  the poster still thinks the message is worth broadcasting to the
  list, they can approve it.  Hopefully this would help prevent flames
  that are sent out for instant gratification and help keep high
  quality in the minds of posters.  The downside of this idea is that
  it puts a small burden on posters.  On the other hand, one or a small
  group of moderators is not overburdened.</a>

<a name="4279qlink2">  <li>  Each post is embargoed for some period of time before being sent to
  the list, for the purpose of delaying poster gratification.</a>

<a name="4279qlink3">  <li>  Each month, anyone who has posted in the previous month gets sent a
  message containing list guidelines, pointers to FAQs, etc., for the
  purpose of keeping quality on the minds of posters.</a>

<a name="4279qlink4">  <li>  Rating, feedback, and/or group moderation schemes.  Any of these
  would require more work, and the permutations are endless.


</UL>
</a><p>
Obviously these could be mixed and varied.

<p>
<a name="4279qlink5">Finally, what is the deal with the public salivating over "chix" I see
on this list?  Strikes me as highly unwelcoming and unbecoming.</a>
