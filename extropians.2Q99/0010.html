Yawn. You should really study some history before making stupid claims. At
that time people owned weapons including cannon and *warships*. Why didn't
they ban private possession of those weapons if they'd be so scared of a
wimpy little assault rifle? Possibly because they always intended that the
second amendment covered an individual right to own military weapons so 
that state militias would be able to defend against any kind of attack
without a standing army?

<p>
Rockets, BTW, were invented by the Chinese many centuries ago, and most
certainly did exist back then. Why doesn't the second amendment say 'the
right to keep and bear arms -- except rockets -- shall not be infringed'?
