<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1512qlink2"><a href="1442.html#1506qlink2">&gt; and how it can be achieved.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="1513qlink2">With a state of being that fulfills both sides of human duality (every human
consists of both a tangible physical existence and an intangible mental
existence).</a>

<p>
<a name="1513qlink3">Through some combination of machines, robots, computers, and/or other
technologies, humanity will have the ability to provide for all tangible
physical needs and desires.</a> Nanotechnology is one such promising technology.
</a>
<a name="1512qlink3">Molecular assemblers, microscopic machines, would build molecules by putting
<a name="1521qlink1">atoms together.<a name="1513qlink4"> Just give this machine any type of matter, such as water, and it
can rearrange the atoms to make anything else, such as an apple, or gold.</a> These
</a>
</a>
<a name="1512qlink4">nanomachines can even make copies of themselves, so that once one is built,
Humanity can have all the nanomachines it wants.<a name="1513qlink5"> Every home could have a
machine, consisting of a very large quantity of these microscopic nanomachines,
to provide for all material needs.</a> For example, if you want a glass of orange
<a name="1513qlink6">juice simply tell the machine and it can use water from a water line connection
to make a glass filled with orange juice.</a> When you are finished drinking the
juice, just put the glass in the machine, and the machine will turn the glass
</a>
back into clean water and send the water down the drain. People will never have
to shop again. New clothes, caviar, lobster, no problem, just tell the machine
to make whatever is wanted. These nanomachines will build miniature
super-computers, and robots of any desired size.<a name="1513qlink7"> People will not have to work
because these robots, computers and machines, will be able to perform any task
that needs to be done, or is desired to be done.</a> However, if one desires to
work, these production methods can be used to create any work environment one
desires. Material poverty will be eliminated.<a name="1513qlink8"> Money, a medium of exchange for
material goods and services, will become obsolete,</a> because every individual can
have all of their material needs and desires fulfilled by this unlimited
production capability. Taxes are no longer necessary. Nanomachines can patrol
the human body killing viruses, deleting any cancerous growths, and regenerating
damaged cells so that one never ages or gets sick. Pollution will not result
from this molecular manufacturing process, and these nanomachines can be
unleashed to clean up any preexisting pollution. There<a name="1513qlink9"> is no need to harvest
trees, or other natural resources, because nanomachines can make anything
desired.</a> Animals will not have to be raised for slaughter to feed humans or
provide clothes, because nanomachines can make anything desired. This unlimited
production system just needs matter and energy to function These machines can
make solar panels and energy storage devices so efficient that the energy from
the sun will be the only power ever needed. The only other thing needed to run
the machines is some type of matter, which can be air, water, dirt, or anything
else that is plentiful. Fantastic engineering feats are possible, such as
see-through domes over cities to eliminate weather concerns, and an extensive
water piping system to eliminate drought and floods. Extraordinary amusement
parks and entertainment centers could be built with this technology. Space
exploration and colonization would be easily feasible with this technology. Etc.

<p>
<a name="1512qlink5">Through some method or combination of methods, Humanity will have the ability to
provide for all  intangible mental needs and desires.</a> Humanity will develop
methods to control and regulate feelings<a name="1512qlink6"> and emotions, increase intelligence,
and eliminate mental illness. People will have a mental heaven through
</a>
mind-shaping. People will have healthy minds free from any mental agony such as
depression, because<a name="1521qlink2"> all mental illness will be cured.</a> Humans will discover how
to access and unleash the full capabilities and power of the brain, and thereby
reach levels of intelligence and thought that takes the essence of being to an
unimaginably complete state of existence. Humanity will be able to achieve
control of the brain so one can elect to have any feeling or emotion desired, or
elect to avoid any feeling or emotion. One will be able to have pure thought
unaffected by feelings or emotions, and unrestrained by sensory or other
limitations. Such mind-shaping methods may involve the use of chemicals and/or
genetic engineering to enhance the pleasure pathways of the brain, and block
negative feedback pathways. This would result is a perpetual state of happiness,
pleasure, and joy. Boredom, anger and other negative feelings and emotions will
no longer plague man.<a name="1513qlink10"> People will be happy about being in a state of happiness,
a perpetual love of everything.</a> Humanity will develop sensory devices to enhance
mental abilities, and virtual reality systems for unlimited mental experiences.
Each individual will have the capability to completely control their thoughts,
and thereby be the god of their own universe, the king of their mental sphere of
existence.

<a name="1512qlink7"><a href="1442.html#1506qlink3">&gt; This is part of it. Knowledge gives us the base to act from, but we</a><br>
<i>&gt; need to be able to interface our various views well too. Knowledge can</i><br>
<i>&gt; help here too, but in the end I think we will find some irreducible</i><br>
<i>&gt; differences in value.</i><br>

<p>
Why do people with different values have to interface?  Instead of standard
rules for all places, humans could establish different rules for different
places so that each person can be in the type of place where there are rules of
conduct and behavior that suits their preference. The amount of technology one
wants in their life is purely a personal choice, and there should be technology
free zones for those who do not want technology in their lives. With the right
knowledge we can find ways for each person to live as they desire.</a>


<p>
<a href="1442.html#1506qlink4">&gt; &gt; Humanity has achieved proficient methods for</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; dissemination of information and simply needs to better utilize the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; same in order to facilitate the use of knowledge. Yet, less than 2%</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of global productivity is devoted toward finding new knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (research and development). Clearly Humanity could and should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; investing more in its future.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Definitely. But I wonder if we really have achived efficient methods</i><br>
<i>&gt; of disseminating information and teaching knowledge.</i><br>

<p>
I said "proficient methods for dissemination". Computers offer an efficient and
economical way to store information, and the Internet provides a method for fast
and easy access to information. These methods are not being fully utilized. I
believe teaching can be made more efficient
