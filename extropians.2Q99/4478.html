Abstract
<br>
  We investigated the influence of dietary
  flavonoids on alpha-tocopherol status and LDL peroxidation
  in rats fed diets enriched in either polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) or
  monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Diets equalized for alpha-tocopherol
  concentrations were or were not supplemented with 8 g/kg diet of
  flavonoids (quercetin + catechin, 2:1). After 4 wk of
  feeding, plasma lipid concentrations were lower in rats fed
  PUFA than in those fed MUFA with a significant correlation between plasma
  alpha-tocopherol and cholesterol concentrations, r = 0.94, P &lt; 0. 0001).
  Dietary lipids influenced the fatty acid
  composition of VLDL + LDL more than that of HDL or microsomes. The resistance
  of VLDL + LDL to copper-induced oxidation was higher in rats fed MUFA than in
  those fed PUFA as assessed by the lower production of conjugated dienes and
  thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and by the &gt;100% longer lag
  time for dienes production. (P &lt; 0.0001). Dietary
  flavonoids significantly reduced by 22% the
  amounts of dienes produced during 12 h of oxidation in rats fed diets rich in
  PUFA and lengthened lag time 43% in those fed MUFA. Microsomes of rats fed
  MUFA produced approximately 50% less TBARS than those of rats fed PUFA (P &lt;
  0.0001) and they contained more alpha-tocopherol in rats fed MUFA than in
  those fed PUFA with higher values (P &lt; 0. 0001) in both groups supplemented
  with flavonoids (P &lt; 0.0001). Our findings suggest that the
  intake of dietary flavonoids is beneficial
  not only when diets are rich in PUFA but also when they are rich in MUFA. It
  seems likely that these substances contribute to the antioxidant defense and
  reduce the consumption of alpha-tocopherol in both
  lipoproteins and membranes.
