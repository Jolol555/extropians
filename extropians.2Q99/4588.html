I just finished the book Friday.  Without a doubt, this is the best novel 
I've read in ten years.  (Although the previously noted minor editorial 
lapses did set my teeth on edge.) I also had the feeling that there was a LOT 
more in the book than I was able to get in the one disjointed (airplane time) 
reading I was able to devote to it.  

<p>
Regarding the military details, Stephenson clearly did his homework.  There's 
a GREAT book called "Bodyguard of Lies" by Anthony Cave Brown that many 
consider to be the "bible" of the history of WWII espionage.  Cryptonomicon 
seemed to be thoroughly consistent with what I recall from "Bodyguard".

<p>
The earlier comment that the book seemed to have a "fractal" structure was 
right on: The lives of the main characters had a recursively repeating 
pattern that provided a depth (often comic) to the over-all story that was 
just, well, awesome.

<p>
BTW, to those who might condemn the plot-line of the book as having too many 
coincidences and "Dickensian" twists, I strongly recommend Tom Wolfe's essay 
about reconstructing "the American Novel" -- he makes the great point that 
novelists should not fear being accused of being too "contrived", because 
reality too often seems that way . . .
