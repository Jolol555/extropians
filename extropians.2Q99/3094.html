<i>&gt; &gt; yes, the only activities which are at lower risk are civil aviation, getting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; struck by lightning, and a few others. The firearns accident rates for children</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and overall are less than a tenth of the rates at the turn of the century.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Au contraire; the number of people in the US who died of gunshot-</i><br>
<i>&gt; related injuries in 1995 was 32,909.  These figures were furnished</i><br>
<i>&gt; by James R. Peterson, a progun activist, in the August issue of</i><br>

<p>
These are accident rates, not crime rates. Get your facts straight. Accidental gunshot
related injuries for 1995 for people under 15 or 18 was about 250. Using suicides or
criminal on criminal gun violence as justification for controlling law abiding usage
is insane, about as insane as using government perpetrated gun crime in europe to
justify taking civilian guns away.
