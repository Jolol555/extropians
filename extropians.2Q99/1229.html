There do seem to be a few 'traditional herbal remedies' that actually work,
so presumably there were others known to ancient cultures that were also
effective.  However, we should keep in mind that we usually wade through
hundreds of completely worthless folk remidies for every one that turns out
to be worthwhile.  That being the case, I'm not sure what we should say
about primitive medicine - if an Athenian physician 'knows' two hundreds
treatments unknown to the modern world, of which 199 are actually worthless
and 1 is moderately effective, should we say he knows something we don't?
Or should we say his bag of tricks is essentially worthless, but every once
in a while he happens to do something right by accident?
