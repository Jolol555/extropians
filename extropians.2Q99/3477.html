Why not just send AIs/robots in the first place?  At which time there is
econonomical enough complete life support, we can send regular humans of all shapes
and sizes.  I guess that is the tradeoff between economical life support for very
functional humans versus economical skillsets for very survivable machines.

Egad.  Hmm...  if the astronaut doesn't have to do anything in transit, then I am
thinking some kind of stasis or something, or a "zombie state", would serve well,
essentially relegating the astronauts to be cargo, albeit a precious one.  We were
talking about this months ago, it was interesting.

Artificial Intelligences are getting closer to reality every day, one would think.
I wonder if they will have a pre-nascent "memory" or consider all the possibly
available data the AI hive or communal memory.  If intelligence denotes self-will
towards survival, maybe the AI would make a bunch of statistically beneficial
investments.  I hope the AI is friendly, I think it would be, especially if it is
programmed to be so.  On something else, DNA is a very complicated code.

<p>
Have a nice day!
