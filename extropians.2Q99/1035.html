National science and technology awards presented at White House 

<p>
WASHINGTON (April 27, 1999 4:26 p.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nandotimes.com">http://www.nandotimes.com</a>) - 
A researcher who developed a test that helped identify causes and 
effects of DNA damage and a surgeon who performed the first 
successful human heart transplant in the United States were among 
this year's recipients of government awards recognizing pioneers in 
science and technology. 

<p>
"Your success in illuminating the hows and whys of our world and 
raising the quality of human existence have helped make the time in 
which we live perhaps the most exciting in human history," President 
Clinton told the honorees Tuesday. "I am humbled by your 
achievements." 

<p>
Clinton presented the National Medals of Science and the National 
Medals of Technology in an East Room ceremony at the White House. 

<p>
The science medal, established by Congress in 1959 to recognize 
contributions to the physical, biological, mathematical and 
engineering sciences, is the nation's highest scientific honor. 
Behavioral sciences were included in 1962. 

<p>
The nine science medal recipients - chosen by the National Science 
Foundation - included Bruce N. Ames, professor of biochemistry and 
molecular biology and director of the National Institute of 
Environmental Health Sciences at the University of California, 
Berkeley. Ames' research on environmental and natural mutagens led to 
greater understanding of certain kinds of DNA damage and resulted in 
public policy recommendations on diet and cancer risks. 

<p>
The other recipients were: 

<p>
-Don L. Anderson, professor of geophysics at the California Institute <br>
of Technology Seismological Laboratory in Pasadena. 

<p>
-John N. Bahcall, professor of natural sciences at the Institute for <br>
Advanced Study, Princeton University. 

<p>
-John W. Cahn, a fellow at the National Institute of Standards and <br>
Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. 

<p>
-Cathleen S. Morawetz, professor emerita at the Courant Institute of <br>
Mathematical Sciences of New York University. 

<p>
-Janet D. Rowley, a cancer researcher at the University of Chicago. <br>

<p>
-Eli Ruckenstein, professor of chemical engineering at the State <br>
University of New York in Buffalo. 

<p>
-George M. Whitesides, professor of chemistry at Harvard University. <br>

<p>
-William Julius Wilson of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at <br>
Harvard University. 

<p>
The technology medal, first presented in 1985, recognizes 
breakthroughs in the creation of new or significantly improved 
products, processes or services. 

<p>
The recipients, including Dr. Denton A. Cooley, the founder, 
president and surgeon-in-chief of the Texas Heart Institute in 
Houston, Texas, were chosen by an independent committee that answers 
to the Commerce secretary. 

<p>
The other technology medal winners were: 

<p>
-Kenneth L. Thompson and Dennis M. Ritchie, of Bell Laboratories and <br>
Lucent Technologies, Murray Hill, N.J. 

<p>
-Robert T. Fraley, Robert B. Horsch, Ernest G. Jaworski and Stephen <br>
G. Rogers of Monsanto in St. Louis. 

<p>
-Biogen, Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. <br>

<p>
-Bristol-Myers Squibb Company of New York City. <br>
