Abstract
<br>
  Investigators collected and analyzed mortality data for &gt;50 diseases,
  including 7 different cancers, from 65 counties and 130 villages in rural
  mainland China. Blood, urine, food samples, and detailed
  dietary data were collected from 50 adults in each village
  and analyzed for a variety of nutritional, viral, hormonal, and toxic
  chemical factors. In rural China, fat intake was less than half that in
  the United States, and fiber intake was 3 times higher.
  Animal protein intake was very low, only about 10% of the US
  intake. Mean serum total cholesterol was 127 mg/dL in rural China versus 203
  mg/dL for adults aged 20-74 years in the United States.
  Coronary artery disease mortality was 16.7-fold greater for US men and
  5.6-fold greater for US women than for their Chinese
  counterparts. The combined coronary artery disease mortality
  rates for both genders in rural China were inversely associated with
  the frequency of intake of green vegetables and plasma
  erythrocyte monounsaturated fatty acids, but positively associated with a
  combined index of salt intake plus urinary sodium and plasma apolipoprotein
  B. These apolipoproteins, in turn, are positively associated
  with animal protein intake and the frequency of meat intake
  and inversely associated with plant protein, legume, and light-colored
  vegetable intake. Rates of other diseases were also
  correlated with dietary factors. There was
  no evidence of a threshold beyond which further benefits did
  not accrue with increasing proportions of plant-based foods in
  the diet.
