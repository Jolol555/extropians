Hi all,

<p>
Consciousness is making my brain hurt (well, not consciousness itself,
obviously, but thinking about it, meta-consciousness, and
meta-meta-consciousness, etc, ow!), and losing faith in causality means that
I am falling over a lot (forget to keep up the illusion of one foot in front
of the other being important to pedestrian motion). Ah hah, that's a very
causal notion, got to be more careful (I might cause myself to look
foolish). I decided to imagine that I am actually progressing through a
large lookup table of states, which happen to resemble walking, and that at
least got me into work this morning (just don't think about it too hard
Emlyn, how's that weather, looks like it might rain, but that's causal,
**BANG** hit my head on the floor again).

a B5 (Babylon 5) fan on the list?<a name="4472qlink1"> Kind of extropian show, puts that Star
Trek crap in its place... but I am disapointed in the humans' lack of
personal modification.</a></a>

Plus the Vorlonns show how you can just answer any difficult open question
with "Yes" or "No", and appear enigmatic rather than stupid, or look like
you are playing your cards close to your chest rather than being just plain
ignorant (Yes this is an oversimplification of Vorlonn mentality, but it
cuts pretty close).
