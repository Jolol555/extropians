<a href="4694.html#4717qlink1">&gt; Also, did you notice that the prevalent appearance norm for women</a><br>
<i>&gt; calls them to try to imitate the look of _pre-pubescent_ girls by</i><br>
<i>&gt; shaving off their body hair?  Doesn't it exploit the same part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the male sexual interest that the same society has criminalized?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
There are theories that the fashion model look is an imitation of
pre-pubescent boys rather than girls, but I guess that doesn't alter your
argument.

<p>
I've always prefered older women myself, but that doesn't appear common (in
my experience).

<a href="4694.html#4717qlink2">&gt; Sex with mundanes - as well anything else with mundanes - </a><br>
<i>&gt; could be considered statutory rape in TH ethical system</i><br>
<i>&gt; (an interesting question is, why entities without sufficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; cognitive abilities are considered as full ethical subjects,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and why there are two lines; with humans, the ethical line</i><br>
<i>&gt; comes from something like 6 months from conception and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; consent line comes at 16 to 18 years, both sharply drawn.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wait for designer creatures...)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Will there be court cases between TH's where intellectual capacities are
measured and compared, to decide if consent was possible (too big a gap
means you are in trouble)? I'd like to see someone draw that quiz up - oh
wait, I think that Eliezer just did. A word of warning would come to mind -
if you do Eliezer's test, and score high, don't publish the results unless
you are considering a life of celibacy!
