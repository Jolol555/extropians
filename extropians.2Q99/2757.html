<pre>
MASTER:         Approach, students.  Close the circle at the feet of 
                the master.  You have come to me asking that I be your
</pre>
guide along the path of Tae Kwon Leap.  But be warned. To learn its
ways, you must learn the ways of your own 
<pre>
     soul.  Let us meditate upon this wisdom now.  So. 
                Ommmmm... 
ED:             Uh, sir... sir! 
MASTER:         Who disturbs our meditation as a pebble disturbs the
stillness of the pond? 
ED:             Me.  Ed Gruberman. 
MASTER:         Ed Gruberman? 
ED:             Yeah.  Uhh, no disrespect or nothing, but, like, how
long is this going to take? 
MASTER:         Tae Kwon Leap is not a path to a door, but a road
leading forever towards the horizon. 
ED:             So, like, what, an hour or so? 
MASTER:         No, no.  We have not even begun upon the path.  Ed
Gruberman, you must learn patience. 
ED:             Yeah, yeah, yeah, patience.  How long will that take? 
MASTER:         Time has no meaning.  To a true student, a year is as a
day. 
ED:             A year?  But I want to beat people up right now!  I got
the pajamas!  Ha!  Hoo!  Yah! 
MASTER:         Beat people up? 
ED:             Yeah, just show me all those nifty moves, so I can start
</pre>
trashing bozos.  That's all I came here for. Yoooo! Ah ta ta ta!  Pretty
good, eh? 
<br>
MASTER:         The only use of Tae Kwon Leap is self-defense.  Do you
know who said that?  Ki Lo Ni, the great teacher. 
ED:             Yeah?  Well, the best defense is a good offense.  You
know who said that?  Mel, the cook on "Alice"! 
MASTER:         No, um, Tae Kwon Leap is the wine of purity, not the
vinegar of hostility.  Meditate upon this truth with us.  Ommmmmmm... 
ED:             Listen, shrimp!  Now are you going to show me some fancy
moves, or am I going to start wiping the walls with you? 
MASTER:         Ed Gruberman, you fail to grasp Tae Kwon Leap. Approach
me that you might see. 
<pre>
ED:             Alright!  Finally, some action! 
MASTER:         Observe closely, class.  BOOT TO THE HEAD.  *thump* 
ED:             Ow!  You booted me in the head! 
MASTER:         You are lucky, Ed Gruberman.  Few novices experience so
</pre>
much of Tae Kwon Leap so soon.  Now we continue. Ommmmm... 
ED:   Hey!  Hey, I wasn't ready.  Come and get me now, 
<pre>
                shorty!  C'mon, are you chicken? 
MASTER:         BOOT TO THE HEAD.  *thump* 
ED:     *Ow*  Okay, now I'm ready.  C'mon, try it now! 
MASTER:         BOOT TO THE HEAD.  *thump* 
ED:         Mind if I just lie down here for a minute? 
MASTER:         Now, class, we shall return to our... 
STUDENT 1:      Master? 
MASTER:         It is wrong to tip the vessel of knowledge, student. 
STUDENT 1:      Many apologies, Master, but I feel Ed Gruberman is not
wholly wrong. 
MASTER:         What do you mean? 
STUDENT 1:      I want to boot some head, too. 
MASTER:         Have you learned nothing from the lesson of Ed
Gruberman? 
STUDENT 1:      Yes, master.  I have learned two things.  First, that
anger is a weapon only to one's opponent. 
MASTER:         Very good. 
STUDENT 1:      Secondly, get in the first shot.  BOOT TO THE HEAD. 
<br>
                *swish* <br>
MASTER:         You missed.  
STUDENT 1:      Uh, yeah... well... I... 
MASTER:    You too shall be honored to learn a lesson. 
STUDENT 1:      There's really no need to...  I've gotta be going... 
MASTER:         BOOT TO THE HEAD.  *thump* 
STUDENT 1:      Owwwwww! 
MASTER:         Can anyone tell us what lesson has been learned here? 
STUDENT 2:      Uh, yes, master.  Not a single one of us could defeat
you. 
MASTER:         You gain wisdom, child. 
STUDENT 2:      So we'll have to gang up on you.  Get 'im, guys! 
MASTER:         BOOT TO THE HEAD.  *thump*  *thump*  *thump*  *thump* 
<br>
                *thump*  *thump*... <br>
</pre>
<br>
   And now, class, let us rejoin the mind to the body, 
  and gaze into the heart of the candle in meditation. 
<pre>
                Ommmm... 
CHORUS:         *groan* 
MASTER:         Very good, class.
