<p>
Participating in the ongoing creative development of life has been
educational and enjoyable.

<p>
I enjoy seeing how diverse, intelligent and versatile life is, and I
enjoy helping it become more so.

<p>
I enjoy watching how life builds on itself and develops into systems
which are highly creative and intelligent.

<p>
I enjoy being a part of the complex, adaptable, creative, intelligent,
self-transformational phemenomenon of life.

<p>
I enjoy developing my body and my mind to be capable of increasingly
more complex behavior and possibilities for action and thought.

<p>
I enjoy studying my world and developing an increasingly accurate
understanding of my world.

<p>
I enjoy playing with ideas and developing them over many years and
sharing them with others.

<p>
I enjoy teaching others what I have learned.

<p>
I enjoy working with others and developing relationships with a high
exchange of value.

<p>
I imagine and develop new technologies and new ways of doing things
which have greater value and potential than those we are currently
using.

<p>
I imagine new ways of living which people may enjoy experimenting with.

<p>
I imagine alternate societies and cultures which people may enjoy
living in.

<p>
I realize that this universe is an ongoing stream of possiblities.

<p>
I am learning to more successfully navigate this stream and make
choices which improve my overall situation.

<p>
I choose to live in a way I honestly believe will benefit me and my
world.

<p>
I choose to explore and develop an increasingly accurate understanding
of myself and my world.

<p>
I choose to experiment with different ways of living and develop ways
of living which promote my goals more effectively.

<p>
I am learning to learn more from each moment.

<p>
Every moment teaches me many lessons, because I have learned to watch
carefully, with great curiosity.

<p>
I take many opportunities to learn new skills and knowledge, educating
myself in as many areas as I can.

<p>
I am learning that I can do more and have a more interesting life as I
learn more knowledge and skills.

<p>
I imagine many possibilities for myself and my world.

<p>
I imagine a creative place, overflowing with creative ideas on all
aspects of living.

<p>
I imagine people of all ages working together on all sorts of projects,
everyone learning from each other.

<p>
I imagine people who have developed many skills and talants and who are
capable of doing anything they imagine.

<p>
I imagine much for the future, and I am looking for others who imagine
similar futures.

<p>
Together, we can do what needs to be done to create the sort of future
we want to live in.

<p>
I am hoping that many will read this message and send it to others to
read.

<p>
I am excited about the future, and I am looking for others to help
create an exciting and enjoyable future for all of us.
