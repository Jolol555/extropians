Just a list suggestion, you know, pretend I have META in the subject
line:


<p>
If the reply-to field was set to the author of the original text 
instead of the list, you tend to find that interpersonal crap tends to
stay off the list, and people write between each other more.  It
strengthens the list community, and keeps stupid spam like the above off
the list and between the people involved, where it belongs.


<p>
I've always wanted to start a list where anyone can unsub anyone else,
so long as everyone else is aware of who did the unsubbing, and to
whom.  It would certainly make for some interesting dynamics   :-)
