<p>
I think thoughtful people are awakening to the possibilities
(inevitability's?) of our technology.

<p>
As an aside, I'm a bit confused by two aspects of the current list
activity, the G*N flamewar and the (thankfully short lived) race
flamewar.
<br>
With most list members actively planning to entirely leave the range of
normal variability of our entire _species_ what possible difference does
race make.
<br>
And, as we discuss technologies that we confidently expect will empower
individuals in areas that only nation states currently walk why is there
debate over hand g*ns?

<p>
Ban me if you will but I think these are valid questions with
implications that should be thought provoking though not flame
provoking.
