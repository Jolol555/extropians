<i>&gt; &gt;The shops are located in outlying suburban towns, out of Chicago's </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;jurisdiction and strategically based to take maximum advantage of </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;their citywide handgun ban.  Unable to touch them any other way, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Daley is suing them under the same regulations one would use </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;against upstream river polluters, claiming that their toxic flow of </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;handguns into the municipality is largely responsible for its </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;unfortunate position as the murder capital of the US (536 of the 700 </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;people killed in Chicago in 1998 died from bullet wounds).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As far as the 'strategic' placing of gun shops, most of them have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; there forever, long before the city banned handguns. Any increase in</i><br>
<i>&gt; business is a normal side effect of a government ban - a grey market.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Daley's lawsuit is still a publicity stunt. There are perfectly good laws</i><br>
<i>&gt; to deal with people who sell to those without proper ID in Illinois - even</i><br>
<i>&gt; if they DON'T live in Chitown. If a dealer anywhere in Illinois sells to</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone without an FOID, they violate at least one state law, and can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; charged.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If one of the 'buyers' was found selling in Chicago, they could again be</i><br>
<i>&gt; charged, as handgun possession in the city is illegal.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The gun dealers are required under Federal law to inquire about the intents</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the purchaser, and must certify that in their opinion the buyer is of</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonably good character. Again, if they sold to someone posing as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; criminal, they should have been arrested.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, just arresting these kinds of people and stopping their</i><br>
<i>&gt; actions does not aid Daley's aganda. He wants everyone disarmed, period. He</i><br>
<i>&gt; is willing to allow illegal and questionable sales to go on so he can point</i><br>
<i>&gt; to this activity and righteously scream for prohibitions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="3376qlink1"><i>&gt; Let's start enforcing what laws we have. Leave the publicity stunts for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; media.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="3434qlink1">As soon as he is able, after a considerable expenditure of money 
and time, to shut down such trade in outlying counties of his state, 
the conduit would extend to out-of-state, where he could do nothing 
to oppose it.  Meanwhile the killing continues.  We have 
protections and checkpoints on our national borders, not on our 
state ones.  To prevent the criminal trade that patchwork gun laws 
promote, they should be nationally standardized.
