I think we may actually have 10 members on the team now, but
how about some more of you guys joining, eh? URL in my sig...
Anyway, here is an update from them about some of the problems
they are having:

<p>
"To our users: SETI@home is off to a great start! We now have
almost 350,000 users, many more than we expected. This has caused
some temporary problems: 

<pre>
     Our servers are overloaded. You have probably seen "can't
     connect to server" messages; the problem is at our end, not
     yours. 

     Credit for work units and CPU time may not show up immediately
     in your totals.
 
     Our new "team" feature has had some problems; If you've joined
     a team, you may need to get a new password and join it again.
 
     We are a bit overwhelmed with emails and bug reports, and won't
     be able to respond to them individually. Please check our "known      bugs"
</pre>
list carefully before reporting problems. 

<p>
We're working hard to fix these problems. With the help of new high-performance
machines from Sun Microsystems, we'll upgrade our server capacity; this will
happen in about a month. We'll release
<br>
new versions of the client software (probably next week) that will
deal with server problems in a more user-friendly way. 

<p>
So please bear with us during these "growing pains", and thanks for being part
of this incredible project."
