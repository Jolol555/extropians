<i>&gt; &gt; I'd like to start by briefly outlining the kind of scheme I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would actually be in favor of.  This will hopefully serve</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to reassure those of you who have decided I'm some kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; closet fascist, and it should also serve as a reference</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; point for comparing what is possible under anarchy to what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is possible under a minimal State.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; When you propose 'limited government' as compromise between anarchy</i><br>
<i>&gt; and another quantity of government you're bound to have problems</i><br>
<i>&gt; convincing anarchists. This is for a very simple reason; a coherent</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarchist viewpoint comes from considering ever more minimal forms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; government and then being hit by the sudden realisation that no</i><br>
<i>&gt; government is the only viable option. Thus when an anarchist comes</i><br>
<i>&gt; across a proposal for a limited or minimalist government it is all too</i><br>
<i>&gt; easy to discard the idea - been there, done that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Government breads government. Any government will be imperfect. Given</i><br>
<i>&gt; that there are certain things (a constitution, for instance) that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government cannot challenge, the only way for the government to 'fix'</i><br>
<i>&gt; an imperfection is outward growth. Anarchy does not have this problem,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is not ideologically driven, and there are no base morals or</i><br>
<i>&gt; ethical imperatives inherent to the system. All the ideology, morality</i><br>
<i>&gt; and ethical imperatives are left to the people.</i><br>

Any law can be added, changed, modified, or deleted, upon majority votes
in both the House and Senate and the President's signature, barring the
President's signature (a veto) requires a 2/3 override vote. The
Constitution can be amended:

<p>
"Article V

<p>
The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary,
shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of
the legislatures of
<br>
two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing
amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and
purposes, as part of this
<br>
Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the
several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or
the other mode of
<br>
ratification may be proposed by the Congress; provided that no amendment
which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight
shall in any
<br>
manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the
first article; and that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived
of its equal suffrage in the
<br>
Senate. "

Flag burning, not to start a fire, is Constitutional, and the correct way
to destroy an old flag.  It is an emblem that can never be destroyed by
those that disrespect it.

<p>
The "Wireless Privacy Act of 1999" which essentially outlaws some
scanners, is unconstitutional, and is not any kind of adequate protection
of privacy.  The adage about guns and outlaws applies.

<p>
Federal agencies currently enjoy non-Constitutional wiretap laws, for
which they are un-American and culpably liable.  The warrant system for
invasion of personal privacy is effectively proven as Constitutional, as
far as I know.  Citizens of the United States are to be considered
innocent until proven guilty, and that, among other things, exposes
certain sectors of government fascism and illegal activity.

<p>
An educated voting populace is the only way to ensure democracy.
