<p>
rape in prison is part of a system of control that inmates have over each 
other, where they create their own hierarchy of power. Many rapists of other 
inmates will *protect* that inmate if trouble occurs. ( eldridge cleaver )

<p>
rape/sex = power. the act is that of power and control over the 
victim/situation and themselves.. strangely enough. in many histories of 
women in culture, (lucy lippard for example) penetration is considered the 
act of control... 

<p>
<a name="3967qlink1">from my experience working at D.O.V.E., a domestic violence hotline for the 
abuser and abused, the aggressor knows the victim is humiliated- and that 
makes the aggressor temporarily</a> 'stonger' and in control over them. 
 
<p>
<a name="4002qlink1"> (a parallel to this is when someone recieves sexually harrassing phone 
calls- the more outraged/humiliated the person is on the line, the better for 
</a>the aggressor. )
