Of course there are!

<p>
Yes.

There are many of use.  I find that I don't post as much as I had several
years ago because of time constraints.  I still look for insightful posts
and try to participate when I have something to say.  But, like most
extropians who have been on the list for a long time, we work toward
spreading extropian memes through our various talents and professions.
This leaves little time to spent on the list on a daily basis.   

<p>
Some of the folks who had at one time posted a bit on this list and were
mentioned in a prior post, I don't even remember being around for more than
a year, which I found to be kind of funny.  So, rest assured, there are
many of us still around and happy that the list continues.  

<p>
<a name="3957qlink1">As far as Vernor Vinge, Hans Moravec and others, they come to our
conferences and parties, so don't think that because they aren't on the
list that they have disappeared.  And, Sara Marr has made a lot of
contributions to the list and is still around and doing well.</a>

Cheers!
