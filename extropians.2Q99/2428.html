should be used in growing them in the wild.  The effect of genetically
modifying crops to withstand disease and insects would be similar to the
problem of bacteria becoming resistant to penicilin - you simply force
the thing you're trying to destroy to become stronger.

more widespread then it cause tremendous ecological damage.  The things
which eat genetically modified soya will also eat other things - which
do not have the superior genetically engineered defenses.
