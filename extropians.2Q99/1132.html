<a name="1292qlink2">Each DNS at each ISP holds a minuscule share of the entire database, most
definitely not the entire database.  It can cache requests that go through
it but that only for a short time (usually one hour) and only of the
request done on it. A DNS usually only holds the IP table for whatever
domains it is acting as a master or as a secondary for, and usually you
only have two servers knowing the IPs for a subdomain.  Whatever ISP you
are using does not have a clue what IP corresponds to
s335984.student.uq.edu.au but the root servers know who the dns master for
edu.au is (munnari.oz.au), who still doesn't know the ip but it knows that
the master dns for uq.edu.au is krefti.uq.edu.au, and so on.  This system
enables each dns to respond quickly to name lookups since they only have
to hold a couple of name to ip matchings but it does mean that it is
fragile.  If the 7 or 8 root servers were taken down all cross domain
lookups (eg from .edu to .com, or from .gov to .uk) would fail after</a> the
corresponding caches expire (1 to 3 hours).
