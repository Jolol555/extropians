<a name="3457qlink2">At the local high school here, any student caught invloved in a fight is
suspended, even if they are defending themselves. The official line is that
they are furthering the violence by fighting back. The proper response, I
guess, is to lay down with throat exposed and hope the attacker goes away,
or that a teacher will see and stop the fight.

Big brother is still out there waiting for us to let him take over our
lives. All we need do is stop fighting stupid laws that take away our
powers to defend ourselves and think for ourselves.
