While I am a bit overweight for my age, I have below normal blood pressure, a low metabolic rate, and normal cholesterol levels. I get occasional exercise (once or twice a week). According to the risk factor scales, I am of low risk for heart disease, especially since the only member of my family who suffered from or died from heart disease was a two packs a day smoker. Because of this, I consider heart disease to not be a sudden or near term problem for me.

I do have a history of procrastination, which tells me I need to get off my duff. I've been toying with the idea for a year or so now.

Yes, its always a trade off, evaluating the high value short term gains against discounting long term gains to calculate their present day value.

Why thank you. I'm trying my best at the moment to get there in one piece and in as favorable a position as possible. I refuse to be immortal and homeless....;)
