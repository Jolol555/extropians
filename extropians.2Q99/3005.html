<i>&gt; &gt;There is an article in the July issue of Playboy about a squad of </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Chicago cops masquerading as bikers and gang members and </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;asking to buy guns with which to commit crimes.  The firearms </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;dealers were most helpful, and in just two months, the police had </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;purchased 171 weapons for $65,000, all for the explicit purpose of </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;aiding in the commission of criminal acts.  One particularly </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;enterprizing gun shop, nestled in the midst of a suburb with a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;population of 14,000 souls, sold 6500 weapons which were </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;subsequently confiscated by Chicago police after being used in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;commission of crimes.  In fact, of the 32, 909 people who died of </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;bullet wounds in 1995 (cars kill more, but not many more), most of </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;these were suicides (18,503), and of the remailing 14,406 </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;homicides, only 616 were ruled justifiable and the rest (13,790, or </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;about 96%) were murders.  One out of every five handguns </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;purchased in the US is used to commit a crime within four years of </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;purchase.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Did they close down this shop? No. They would rather allow the illegal</i><br>
<i>&gt; sales to continue so that Mayor Daley could be the big man and sue gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; manufacturers, etc. - and make lots of media attention for himself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the police and prosecutors refuse to take action against illegal</i><br>
<i>&gt; sellers, they are more responsible for the carnage than the sellers</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves. These officials should be prosecuted for malfeasance in office.</i><br>

<a name="3281qlink1"><a name="3024qlink4">The shops are located in outlying suburban towns, out of Chicago's 
jurisdiction and strategically based to take maximum advantage of 
their citywide handgun ban.  Unable to touch them any other way, 
Daley is suing them under the same regulations one would use 
against upstream river polluters, claiming that their toxic flow of 
handguns into the municipality is largely responsible for its 
unfortunate position as the murder capital of the US (536 of the 700 
people killed in Chicago in 1998 died from bullet wounds).
