Hello, extropian group,

<p>
Good show.  I am finding some links about these medicinal things for your
leisure.

Here are some links about medicine I have previously collected:

<p>
To ignore real medicinal treatments is ignorant.

<p>
Patents on drugs expire after 17 years.  The use of generic prescription drugs
is much more economical for large quantities, eg aspirin, an effective
analgesic.  In Russia, they invented "assembly-line surgery" for glaucoma
treatment, but I do not recommend that because person-to-person interaction and
familiarity is very important for correct diagnoses.

<p>
As I have stated before, I respect medical research, and research in general.
Education is a path to enlightenment.

<p>
Also, as I have stated before, the massive overprescription of
psycho-"therapeutics" is akin to doping the receivers, instead of teaching them
to deal with their "problems."  Also, it is expensive.  More than %90 of almost
any pill is filler.

<p>
For many acute and chronic ailments, skilled medical treatment is the best way
to alleviate these ailments.  I feel lucky in that I have been treated by good
doctors, a good ophthalmologist, orthodontist, and dentist.  I have some friends
in medical school and the drug industry and they are good people.

<p>
Taking care of our infirm elderly and disabled is a wonderful legacy of Franklin
Delano Roosevelt's "New Deal."  Social Security and its restructuring is a
different issue.  Helping people to help themselves is the goal.

<p>
As might be noted, I can be quite voluble on almost any topic.  I believe the
Hippocratic Oath is a good one.

<i>&gt; &gt;Amazingly enough, researchers have yet to measure a significant aggregate</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;effect of medicine (doctors, etc.) on health.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The studies that have looked at the aggregate health effect of medicine as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;typically practiced, averaging over all the things doctors do, have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;found a significant effect.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;And it must surely give</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;pause to those who hope that medicine will soon give us dramatically</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;expanded life spans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Some excellent points, however, before we scrutinize medicine, it might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; better to begin with health care in general.  Can we measure a discernable</i><br>
<i>&gt; effect of health care availability and services on the longevity and health</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a population?  I don't have the data readily available but my</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding is that the increase in average lifespan of the population of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the United States and other countries with relatively high availability of</i><br>
<i>&gt; modern health care services is significantly higher than that of many Third</i><br>
<i>&gt; World countries without such health care services.  However, this does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessarily mean health care is the primary driver of this trend.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Generally, countries with robust health care systems are more educated and</i><br>
<i>&gt; wealthier than less advantaged countries.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; One way to test the importance of health services would be to take a group</i><br>
<i>&gt; of people within the United States that does not utilize health care</i><br>
<i>&gt; services (e.g., Christian Scientists) and compare them to a sample of those</i><br>
<i>&gt; who do.  It would be a complex task since there are probably other lifestyle</i><br>
<i>&gt; factors that might contribute to lifespan effects within each group.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be more interesting if we completely eliminated health care for a five</i><br>
<i>&gt; year period and observed the effect on lifespan and death incidents in</i><br>
<i>&gt; general.  Certainly, there would be instances of increased death (e.g.,</i><br>
<i>&gt; childbirth, cancer victims, heart disease, etc.)  However, there could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; ameliorative effects from freeing 14% of the GDP to be spent on education,</i><br>
<i>&gt; hunger, research, and other areas that might increase longevity (not that</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm naive enough to think that all of this money would be allocated to such</i><br>
<i>&gt; endeavors)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As far as medicine is concerned, its obvious that it can provide immediate,</i><br>
<i>&gt; short-term benefits.  The relief that medicine provides from symptoms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; different maladies is real.  While the "mind over body" effect is relevant,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is doubtful it applies to my children who also experience relief from</i><br>
<i>&gt; symptoms.  Given that my two year old acts as if medicine were the plague</i><br>
<i>&gt; when we attempt to give it to her nixes the "mind over body" effect as a way</i><br>
<i>&gt; to discount the validity of all medicine.  There might be come minimal</i><br>
<i>&gt; lifespan effects to this short-term relief.  The toll a sickness might take</i><br>
<i>&gt; on your system if allowed to "run its course" might take some time off your</i><br>
<i>&gt; lifespan.  Additionally, the stress I would go through if I had to endure my</i><br>
<i>&gt; children dealing with a particularly nasty flu virus without the assistance</i><br>
<i>&gt; of antibiotics might shorten my own lifespan in some way.  I don't know what</i><br>
<i>&gt; the aggregate effects of medicine is over an entire life but I suppose any</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase is a good thing.  Whether we could spend 14% of the GDP to increase</i><br>
<i>&gt; lifespan in a more effective and efficient manner is question that should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; asked but I don't know the answer to it.</i><br>
