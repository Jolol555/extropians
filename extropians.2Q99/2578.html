 It is not a stark and bipolar choice between an absolute ban and 
 the absence of all restrictions.  This is an illicit and absolutistic 
 straw-man argument which possesses not even a passing 
 acquaintance with the rational, reasonable, targeted and limited 
 proposals under discussion. &gt;&gt;

<p>
I don;t think that an "absolutistic" argument is necessarily a straw man. I 
actually think that making it out to be one is a straw man, ironically.</a>

<p>
<a name="2587qlink2">There are those who have "absolutistic" moral principles, and this does not 
make them irrational or unreasonable.</a> Mabye the reason that this argument is 
<a name="2587qlink3">going nowhere is because you are arguing past each other. Differenet 
moralities will give different answers to the same situation. If you keep 
this argument so concrete ( " I'm right, obviously" " No, I'm right, 
obviously"), you will get nowhere, obviously</a> ; ).

<a name="2909qlink2">debate on the foundations of transhuman ethics. Without these,</a> any concrete 
<a name="2909qlink3">instance will be quite beyond any debate, much like differing epistemological 
methods would keep the debate useless.</a>

<p>
Any takers?
