<a name="0599qlink1"><a name="0597qlink1">It's interesting how quickly the grey-gooers can write off natural life,</a>
<a name="0599qlink2">as if we would be able to invent stuff which could get out of control
and kill it all off overnight. Biological life is pretty hardy</a> - how
<a name="0599qlink3">long would it be before bacteria or insects or something developed which
could feed on the alleged goo? After all, it would probably be made</a> out
<a name="0599qlink4">of similar stuff to natural life, given that it lives in the same
environment and has the same resources available.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="0599qlink5">How quickly would natural life develop, which could outcompete the
hard-life, and to whose presence the hard-life could not adapt? This</a> is
<a name="0599qlink6">especially likely if the hard life was some heavily tuned soft-life
eater, because it would have to be so specific that it would have
trouble adapting to new environments.</a>

<a href="0570.html#0593qlink1">&gt;2. The very idea of "nonbiological, free-living replicators" is absurd. </a><br>
<i>&gt;It is possible to have replicators that use different materials and have</i><br>
<i>&gt;different sources of energy than natural cells, but any free-living</i><br>
<i>&gt;organism that replicates will be "biological" in a general sense.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hard life, like natural life, will be constrained by time, space, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;energy; there will still be such a thing as bioenergetics.  Each species</i><br>
<i>&gt;will have its own niche.  There will still be predators and prey, and there</i><br>
<i>&gt;will still be an ongoing arms race between predators and prey, as described</i><br>
<i>&gt;by Dawkins.  There will still be symbiotic relationships and parasitic</i><br>
<i>&gt;relationships between species.  In other words the general form of biology</i><br>
<i>&gt;will remain the same.  The essential difference will be that organisms will</i><br>
<i>&gt;be able to change themselves, like corporations do, instead of depending on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the blind process of natural selection.  </i><br>
