This is exactly what happens when you bring up not easily resolved issues 
with many repercussions. With grey areas. With more than one solution. One 
falls into a conundrum, based on values, and flames ensue. Same damn thing 
happens at gatherings.

I believe that most people are not as easily swayed as Danial and his mother 
by the ideas of others. Especially if the "others" face off against you and 
take a stand.

I agree with Tom's post that reading a few books on rhetoric could be 
helpful. 

<p>
Point taken also that if we are not verbal about our constitutional right we 
could lose it.  Write to your congressman, get a bumper sticker. Vote.

<p>
My point about the debate was merely this: I felt as if I had been in a time 
. Low and behold, when I returned to the list nearly three years later: the 
same exact conversaions were occuring!!!!! Now, in a group that wants to 
hasten CHANGE, is this productive?
