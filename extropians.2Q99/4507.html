The speculation was yours, and I fed it back to you.

<p>
I do think that the basis in this particular thread for which you are apply
your facts is wrong.

<p>
First, it a generalization that "American" men perceive women as a "whole"
in the context Rob stated, because if so then we must include our mothers,
sisters, daughters as well as the women who perform services with and to
males, such as business associates, physicians and counselors, architects,
technicians, engineers, and any of the other lines of service as
superficial masquerading minds.

<p>
Second, it is not accurately an "insult" for women for the type of male who
considers women to be superficial, because they can make a pretty good
living as being conceived as such.  

<p>
Making a pretty good living being conceived as such means that they are
making monetary profits.  The fact that they make a pretty good living at
it means that they place more emphasis on the monetary gains than suffering
a psychological "insult" from how they are making a living by taking
advantage of the situation and reaping profits from it. 

<p>
Thirdly, and lastly, we might as Rob to play fair and deal his deck of
cards on the table.  Rob?

<p>
Cheers!
