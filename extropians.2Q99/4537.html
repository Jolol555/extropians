Hal, I agree with your basic point, but it raises another set of questions.

<p>
<a name="4622qlink1">Swapping, paging, dynamic load-balancing, and all that other interesting 
"modern OS" crud (that I used to do for a living) is all based on the 
economics of computer hardware circa 1965-1990. The situation in 2020 
should be a lot different, although no doubt there will still be some legacy 
systems to deal with (job security for computing fossils).

<p>
It's getting a little ahead of the argument to speculate about optimal 
architectures for an upload host computer, but we can think about some 
requirements. Being rather fond as most of us are of our personal 
boundaries, I doubt that we'll want to be hosted on some server running AIX 
11.20 &lt;grimace&gt; with a bunch of other uploads:

<a name="4540qlink2">You said that right at the end -- our upload host will be the ultimate 
PERSONAL computer; we'll be gravely concerned with its security and 
reliability. We'll also want all the raw power we can get. Processors will be 
</a>
cheap, there will be processors everywhere, maybe one per 
neuron/synapse in the neural net part, and way more than we need to run 
the rest of it (assuming a hybrid machine, part NN and part symbolic).</a>  

<p>
I'd say  at least 2/3 of the mass of a typical mind machine would be tied up 
in support, defense and security systems. So you'd need three grains of 
salt, sugar cubes, or planets, depending on how ambitious you are, to 
instantiate a design whose core function takes one.

<p>
So definitely no virtual memory for this old ndn's main system. Plenty of 
backup and a monster 'Net connection, though.
