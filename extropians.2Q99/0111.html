Actually, there is no federal law against euthanasia. There are several
states which allow it, while the rest ban it. The US Coast Guard would
be in a quandary as to which state to prosecute you in, and you could
easily get off since federal officials are do not have jursidiction to
enforce state laws, so if you are in international waters they are SOL.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0114qlink4"><a href="0097.html#0111qlink3">&gt; &gt;What would their legal possibilities be for harassment (assuming you stay</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in international waters all the time)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Add to the above Greenpeace, the Medellin cartel,</a> the Roman Catholic</i><br>
<i>&gt; Church...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With the U.N. granting virtual letters of marque &amp; reprisal to any</i><br>
<i>&gt; member nation with their "crimes against humanity" rules, you'd also</i><br>
<i>&gt; be prey to any international conglomerate. There's no such thing as</i><br>
<i>&gt; "international waters" when it comes to pursuing individual courses of</i><br>
<i>&gt; action held anathema by U.N. members: for them, it just means "open</i><br>
<i>&gt; season for all."</i><br>

<p>
Greenpeace needs a few more ships sunk. The Roman Catholics have no
navy, nor any coast to guard or to port ships at, while the UN has no
navy. They can issue a marque for anyone to pursue, but then again you
are dealing with a body where it takes at least a couple of the
heavyweights on the Security Council to get ANYTHING done, and all you
have to do is bribe the temporary 3rd world member who just happens to
be sitting on it that year.

<a name="0114qlink5"><a href="0097.html#0111qlink4">&gt; &gt;Thoughts, anyone?</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, and this isn't a joke. You might be safer finding just such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; willing nation and building the center on land.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0114qlink6"><i>&gt; You might even be able to convince a nation such as China to sponsor</i><br>
<i>&gt; you. Fairly dictatorial; but if they say it's fine with them, also</i><br>
<i>&gt; fairly safe from foreign intervention.</i><br>

<p>
Yeah, but bribes everywhere.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0114qlink7"><a href="0097.html#0111qlink5">&gt; Above all, consult with Scientologists: they're used to dealing with</a><br>
<i>&gt; legal harrassment concerning their health care choices. There might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; some states that might not prove as inimical to the concept on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; USA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Yes, this is where it might pay to set up a religion to provide the
legal protection for such activities. If it is established that
cryopreservation of living persons, euthanasia, etc are all religious
sacraments, then you can get protection pushed through, though there
</a>
will most likely be court challenges.


<p>
<a href="0097.html#0111qlink6">&gt; Another clue: unincorporated US territories aren't fully under federal</a><br>
<i>&gt; legislation. Sadly, the freest territory from US legislation is Puerto</i><br>
<i>&gt; RIco, which also happens to be rather socially conservative and</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely centralized in local government affairs.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0145qlink1">Unincorporated US territories are completely under federal law, as they
are federal trust territories.<a name="0112qlink1"> PR gets tax preferences as a bribe to
stay in association with us and for no other reason. They also have a
special 'commonwealth' status that our other territories do not enjoy.
If they had to pay taxes to the gringos they would have been gone a long
time ago.</a>
