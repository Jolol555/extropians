&lt;caveat&gt;I'm certainly the wrong person to ask.&lt;/caveat&gt;

I personally never understood what it was that made VB big. Delphi
always looked much nicer to me.

Sticking with M$ should remain to be cushy yet for several years to
come. Linux is definitely on the rise, however. It is overhyped, it is 
not there yet, but you need to move now to accrue the skills in time.

<p>
<a href="3215.html#3232qlink3"> &gt; I have fiddled with Visual C++, but I get the feeling that C++ may not</a><br>
<i> &gt; be so hot in a couple of years.  I thought at one point that Java might</i><br>

<i> &gt; looking for Java skills around here (mostly they want VB, VB and more</i><br>
<i> &gt; VB with maybe some Interdev/ASP stuff thrown in for good measure).</i><br>
 
<p>
Java is definitely not something that can be ignored on the long
run. If you're interested in increased productivity I definitely
recommend Python <a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a> here. It is not nearly as good
in painting GUIs as VB or Delphi are, however.

<p>
<a href="3215.html#3232qlink4"> &gt; I've recently installed Linux to play around with, but I see very</a><br>
<i> &gt; little need for Linux programmers (I'm in the Raleigh/Durham, NC area)</i><br>
<i> &gt; currently.  </i><br>
 
<p>
Ah, but you asked about the NEXT Big Thing. People should pay you for
solving their problems in the best possible way. I have no idea how to 
prevent your clients from dictating particular OSses/development
platforms. I personally detest Microsoft enough not to pick up a job
requiring using their products.

<p>
<a href="3215.html#3232qlink5"> &gt; I have no formal programming training - I have a degree in worthless</a><br>
<i> &gt; Journalism and with a family I don't have time to go back to school</i><br>
<i> &gt; right now...</i><br>
 
<p>
Python is very easy to pick us. Internet support is excellent, too.

<p>
<a href="3215.html#3232qlink6"> &gt; Any advice?  Comments?  Etc?</a><br>
