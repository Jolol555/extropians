Washington: The Net Must Pay
<br>
by Declan McCullagh

<p>
2:30 p.m.  27.Apr.99.PDT
<br>
WASHINGTON -- Whenever a new form of evil extrudes into American society, demands
for Internet
<br>
regulation seem to arrive faster than a greyhound on crack.

<p>
Remember the TWA 800 crash three years ago? By the time investigators determined
that the airline
<br>
disaster was not a terrorist act, Washington officials already had spent the better
part of a year
<br>
complaining about the dangers of the Internet.

<p>
Rescue workers were still pulling bodies from the rubble of the Oklahoma City
federal building when
<br>
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California) introduced an amendment to censor
bomb-making Web sites.
<br>
Senator Joe Biden (D-Delaware) joined her in moral outrage, claiming his staff
unearthed a recipe on
<br>
Usenet for "baby food bombs" that were "so powerful that they can destroy a car."

<p>
Those disasters, of course, had little to do with the Internet. But when word got
out that the alleged
<br>
gunmen in the Littleton massacre were Doom-playing, AOL-subscribing,
Web-site-publishing computer
<br>
geeks, calls for censorship came even more quickly than before. Bolstered by polls
showing that
<br>
Americans feel Internet controls are necessary, Washingtonians spent this week
demanding
<br>
restrictions.

<p>
During a speech Tuesday afternoon devoted to a proposal to limit handgun purchases
and other
<br>
restrictions on firearm ownership, President Clinton said his plan would keep guns
out of the hands of
<br>
criminals.

<p>
He also blamed "violence on TV, in the movies, on the Internet, in songs, [and]
video games that you
<br>
win based on how many people you kill." Gun rights advocates have argued that
firearm availability
<br>
saves lives, pointing to research at the University of Chicago that found when
states made it legal to
<br>
carry concealed weapons, murders dropped by an average of 8.5 percent.

<p>
At a White House briefing earlier Tuesday, the Washington press corps complained
about the lack of
<br>
controls on Web publishing. One reporter asked whether government officials would
come up "with
<br>
some solution to get all this hatred and bigotry and violence [off] the Internet?"

<p>
Replied Bruce Reed, an adviser to President Clinton: "I think that that is part of
[a] larger discussion
<br>
we have to have not only with Internet providers, but also with Hollywood and with
video game
<br>
manufacturers, and everyone else who contributes in some way to making this culture
[as] violent as
<br>
possible."

<p>
Reed said the First Amendment limited how aggressive the government could be in a
crackdown, but
<br>
another official said he could see a way around it.

<p>
"The court has really struck down every government effort to try to regulate [the
Internet]. We tried
<br>
it with regard to pornography. It is going to be a difficult thing, but it seems to
me that if we can
<br>
come up with reasonable restrictions, reasonable regulations in how people interact
on the Internet,
<br>
that is something that the Supreme Court and the courts ought to favorably look
at," Eric Holder, the
<br>
deputy attorney general, said Sunday on NPR's All Things Considered.

<p>
A poll shows broad support for such plans. Three-quarters of Americans believe
bomb-making
<br>
information should not be allowed online, according to a survey of 450 adults
conducted by CBS News
<br>
on Thursday. Some 68 percent want the FBI or other federal law enforcement agencies
to monitor the
<br>
Internet. Free speech advocates argue that such a rule would violate the First
Amendment.

<p>
Senator Charles Schumer (D-New York) said Monday he had renewed hopes that Congress
would
<br>
quickly approve his Internet Gun Trafficking Act. Introduced in March, the bill
would require Web sites
<br>
that include information about gun sales to be register with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and
<br>
Firearms.

<p>
All this jockeying for political position could be considered unseemly in the wake
of a tragedy, but it
<br>
also appears to be inevitable.

<p>
"Scapegoating takes us further from the root of the problem," said Solveig
Singleton, director of
<br>
information studies at the Cato Institute.

<p>
"The main responsibility must lie with the perpetrators themselves, their parents,
and others in a
<br>
position to have a good understanding of the danger -- those who are closest to the
problem."

<i>&gt; &gt; Oh well, I'm looking forward to the day when finally all information is</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Me too.  Karsten, I was at Yale a few years ago with a friend who</i><br>
<i>&gt; was an alumnus of that establishment.  He showed me a library there</i><br>
<i>&gt; which houses a collection of books, most of which were published in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the 18th century.  I was astounded there were so many of them, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the days before automatic typesetting.  As it turns out, one cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; browse these books, as they are too delicate.  I asked the librarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; if there is any effort to download their contents into ascii files, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; as it turns out, there is no such effort, nor most likely ever will be.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Reason: the information found therein is perfectly useless.  There is some</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientific speculations perhaps, useful only to the historian, some</i><br>
<i>&gt; historical information, same as above, but the overwhelming majority</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the information found in all those old books: (have you guessed?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; sermons!  If that is not bad enough, they are all heavily dependent</i><br>
<i>&gt; upon each other.  With the more lax standard of those times regarding</i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual property rights, we have jillions of versions of a very few</i><br>
<i>&gt; sermons.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I now suspect that within 20 years, *all* the information currently found</i><br>
<i>&gt; in print-only format will be no more useful in that form than the collection of</i><br>
<i>&gt; mostly sermons in the stacks at Yale.  spike</i><br>
