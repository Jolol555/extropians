people loving, thinking, and doing with a strong philosophy?
Well, you got it! Merrill Lynch and JWT (the ad agency) have come together
to really make something wonderful. They are doing EVERYTHING right. This
is why the recent ad campaign of M. Lynch, "Technology," is by
far my favorite. I am in love with this commercial. I swear it made me
CRY! Job well done!

<p>
I am sure people think I am insane for caring so much about this, but it
matters to me. Seeing greatness, even in a commercial, is a highlight in
my life. Please please please, take the time to view  this ad, it is well
worth the watch. 

<p>
Merrill Lynch and JWT present "Technology."

Great commercials are my hobby. I research them and just love them to
death. Smile. If you want to know of other interesting ad campaigns or
have questions, feel free to ask. I have a ton of them and am creating a
website called "Excellence in Advertising." Enjoy!
