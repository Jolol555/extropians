<p>
Can you go through your reasons for believing that qualia are enormously
improbable? I understand it has something to do with the seeming
impossibility of finding a definition for "instantiation"</a> of a
computation, but what is the connection exactly?

<p>
<a name="4192qlink2">Also, do you think it is possible to program a Turing-computable being to
behave as if it has qualia even though it doesn't really? If so how can we
tell we are not such beings? I'm thinking "I have qualia" but that is what
such a being would be thinking as well. Conversely, how do we know it's
not the case that non-sentient animals also have qualia, but they just
can't communicate that fact to us?</a> 

<p>
<a name="4192qlink3">When you talk about non-Turing-computable "Weird Physics" are you thinking
of physics that would be computable under a more powerful model of
computation (for example TM with various oracles), or something entirely
different?
