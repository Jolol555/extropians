<p>
Yes, of course.  My view is "static" only in the sense that I think changes
will always occur within an unchanging framework.  Changes will occur, no
doubt about it.  

<p>
<a href="0437.html#0510qlink2">&gt; But then as I pointed out earlier, my main concern </a><br>
<i>&gt; is only whether science will ultimately be *sufficient* </i><br>
<i>&gt; for a certain, limited goal.  </i><br>

<p>
If your goal is reviving cryonicists, I don't know about that.  But if you
can<a name="0521qlink1"> hang on for another 20 or 30 years, *and* if you affiliate yourself
with the right group, it won't be necessary to die at all.</a>  

<p>
I think people are reading a lot into my work that isn't there.  I do
anticipate major changes in the coming half century.  We are heading for
one of the great extinction events in the history of this planet, probably
the greatest extinction event in the last 200 million years.  Not many
humans or other organisms will survive.  The darwinian competition will
reach an unprecedented level.  Belief systems of any kind will be literally
fatal.  He who sees reality with unsparing clarity -- and acts on what he
sees -- will survive.

&gt; I've wasted enough time on this already. <br>

<p>
We agree about that, if nothing else.
