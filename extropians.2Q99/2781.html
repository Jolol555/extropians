What you'd rather be tazered by a mean drunk without response than to shoot the bastards
kneecaps off?</a>

d: with debating skills like this, its no wonder dwayne prefers getting tazered to getting
shot, since one or the other is probably highly likely in his future.</a> ;)

<p>
It would be a nice place to live, if you could live in a society of irrational disarmed
people that was governed by a government comprised solely by rational people. How likely</a> is
that?
