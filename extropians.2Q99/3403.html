<a href="3366.html#3403qlink1">&gt; ...orbit is a combination of the satellite's velocity in a straight line</a><br>
<i>&gt; and the force of the Earth's gravitational pull on the satellite.  These</i><br>
<i>&gt; forces are similar to the forces that keep all the planets in their places...</i><br>

<p>
"Similar to"?  It is amazing to me sometimes just how poor quality
some of the educational materials for children are, especially about
science.  I've also pointed out some errors like this to some sites,
and they are often reluctant to make corrections (and I can see why
they have no particular reason to trust me either, but you'd think
they'd at least make the effort to find a trustable authority and
verify the facts).

<p>
Which brings me to a question: is there an already existing (but
perhaps underfunded and understaffed) organization that checks
educational websites for accuracy, perhaps attaching an approval
logo to those that pass?  Seem like a worthy endeavor, and such a
service might be able to even make money if done right.
