I think by the time you might be able to achieve something
that really approaches immortality (just making your body
live for a long time is not what I mean here.. I mean total
immunity to accidents, nukes, planet destruction, etc.), it
won't matter so much. And until something approaching that
level of immortality exists, I think most people will just
consider themselves to have longer than normal lives, but
otherwise still just the same.

<p>
On the other hand, I would like it very much if some kind
of "right to life-extension" was added to our constitution
(USA). Sometimes the FDA and other pieces of government
get in the way of things that we want...
