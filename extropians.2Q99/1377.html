<a name="1387qlink1">No problem.  The myth of limited natural resources has been debunked so
thoroughly on so many occasions that it is amazing anyone with any sense
could still believe it.  I highly recommend Julian Simon's works for a
detailed look at why the meme of limited resources doesn't describe</a> the real
world.

So, we must preserve everything as it is or suffer dire consequences?
Someday we'll need those snail darter?  You should know better than that.
This whole idea was dreamed up by people who worship nature (often
literally) as an excuse to justify their desire to sacrifice humanity</a> on the
alter of conservation.

<p>
<a name="1387qlink3">There is no good reason to believe that their concerns are real.  The
species that we actually depend on for survival are in no danger at all.
Exotic species have some limited significance as sources for new drugs, but
that is rapidly diminishing as our ability to design such things improves.
The only real risks I see are to the tourism industries of the third world.</a>

<a name="1387qlink5">they rest purely on moral and/or esthetic grounds.<a name="1411qlink8">  From a purely pragmatic

<a name="1387qlink9">You're welcome to try and persuade them to clean up their act, of course,
and I wish you luck.  However, you ought to recognize the fact</a> that is where
<a name="1387qlink10">the battle is - America and Europe already believe in conservation, and we
already devote more resources to such projects than can be justified on

<p>
<a name="1387qlink11"><a href="1371.html#1377qlink5">&gt; "racist"? What a stretch! You've gone silly on me..</a><br>

<p>
I doubt it applies to you, but it does accurately describe the ideas</a> of many
<a name="1387qlink12">influential Green thinkers.  They hate humanity, and believe that animals
and plants are morally superior beings.  They believe that human needs must
be sacrificed in a quest to preserve every ecological system on Earth in a
state of eternal stasis, no matter what the cost to us may be.  If that
isn't racism (or, to turn around one of their favorite terms,</a> "speciesism"),
what is?
