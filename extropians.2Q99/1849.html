Legislation is violence.  No matter how much one pretends that this
isn't true, the fact won't go away.  Those who propose and pass laws
are enabling armed police to forcibly detain and imprison people who
violate them, even if they do so peacefully.  Sometimes civilized
discourse is not sufficient to point out just how evil some of these
actions really</a> are.

<p>
<a name="1850qlink2">If you advocate legislation, be prepared to back up your opinions
with your blood.</a>  You are morally responsible for the violence
<a name="1850qlink3">used to enforce those laws, and a legitimate target for those who
fight them.  I am prepared to take moral responsibility for laws
against violence and theft; if history proves me wrong, I accept
the consequences.</a>  I am not willing to accept such responsibility
<a name="1850qlink4">for laws against peaceful use of technology--be it drugs, money,
or guns--or laws granting "property" status to ideas, and many other
laws that some people favor.  I may be wrong, and I'm willing to
entertain discussions on the matter peacefully.  But when a bill is
signed into law, the line between discussion and force has been
crossed, and I cannot be silent.  No matter how loudly I may "rave",
it is still peaceful discourse compared to the violence of law.</a>
