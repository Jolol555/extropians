&gt; &gt; The difference between hard and soft sciences

<i>&gt;  &gt; root laws of the universe.</i><br>

	it seems to me that the differences, while quite present, are merely 
matters of degree; degree of uncertainty, to be more specific. 
<p>
	lets say your gonna do a sociology experment: you do a survey. the 
uncertanity involved stems from, at the very least, the possiblity that the 
ppl you survey might be lying to you, and that there could always be a 
different explanation then the one you thought of that might better fit the 
data.
<p>
	now lets say your gonna do a physics experment: you take some 
measurements. the uncertainty involved stems from, at the very least, the 
possibility that the insturments your using might be malfunctioning, and that 
there could always be a different explanation then the one you thought of 
that might better fit the data.
<p>
	their both uncertain, of course... but its a lot easier to figure out 
if an insturment is malfunctioning then it is to figure out if a person is 
lying to you about the way they feel... so at root, are not both experments 
at least somewhat axiomatic?
<p>
	also: ive heard it said that hard sciences study 'objects', while 
soft sciences study the 'interactions' of those objects... but a reason i 
disagree with that is that the distenction between the 'interaction' and the 
'thing itself' get really really blurry sometimes... not to mention that even 
once u finally label things, its often impossible to study the 'thing' 
without studying the 'interactions', and vice versa... and arnt all 
'interactions' 'things', in some sense? 
<p>
	no, im not confused. i honestly know what im talkin about here 
::coughcough:: ahem... =)

GREAT LATE-NIGHT SUBURBAN BANG!!!"
