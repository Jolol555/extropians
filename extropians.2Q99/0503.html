<p>
Purportedly, the vast space between the stars prevents opressive governments from extending their reach indefinitely, so the crashes are limited to the star system. Vinge speaks of two causes for falls:


<OL>
  <li>  development of a total surveillance society/government
  <li>  if the first is avoided, eventually, the software infrastructure becomes so layered and bug ridden that it collapses under its own weight of complexity.


</OL>
<p>
The second cause does not reach beyond a star system because software controlled systems do not extend beyond the star system, so when the software fails, the failure is limited to that star system.

<p>
I also wonder at this, why the Queng Ho do not develop and sell an all purpose single layer software technology which does not need further development, interpretation, or modification. If they did this, they could avoid the second cause. It should not be too hard to develop simple intelligent agents which routinely scour code for bugs, debugging as they go. We already have them for many types of compilers, even for web pages.

<p>
<a href="0501.html#0503qlink2">&gt; &gt;&gt;These falls are very severe, often requiring re colonization from</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;the outside, and otherwise seem to require rebuilding from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;scratch.  This is much more severe than the fall of the Roman</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;Empire, for example.  ...</i><br>

<p>
Imagine that much of a sytem's population lives in orbiting colonies or on airless moons. These populations' entire air, water, and food processing and distrupution systems are fully automated. When these systems fail, the people starve, suffocate, and die of thirst. When a planetary population lives in hive cities, it is much of the same, and when the food supply is automated hydroponics, or is based on seeds that have suicide genes like the Monsanto IP protection gene, then starvation on planets will happen.

<p>

<a href="0501.html#0503qlink3">&gt; &gt;We also see biological weapons, which should be sufficient.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not yet persuaded of that.  If bio weapons can kill all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; humans in a star system, why doesn't it spread to other star</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems via the trading ships?  If trading ships can block</i><br>
<i>&gt; the spread, why can't places within a star's system use the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same approach?</i><br>

<p>
Presumably because a bioweapon that severe will not allow a starship's crew to survive the voyage, so the crew will not be there to respond to hails by the port crews at the end of the trip, so the ship will be destroyed or allowed to cruise on through the system and back into the depths of space.

<p>
This is similar to the spread of the Black Plague. while ships helped spread it to other ports within sufficient distance such that only a small percent of the crew succumbed during the voyage, the port authorities at the end of the voyage would often refuse docking to a ship they feared was a plague carrier.
