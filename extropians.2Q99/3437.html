I don't give a damn about government. It's just that such a thing
would be good to have if you have got kids and guns in the same
house, or if a crook steals your gun. Mechanical guns are intrinsically 
difficult to secure, but these things would be safe (unless somebody 
throw them into fire, or microwaved them -- hmm, "I microwaved daddy's 
gun, that's how he got mugged").

There are flashable transponders, but why bother? Hardwired IDs must
seem much more secure.

The bad thing about transponders is that they can be used for
unsolicited identification. The chip that opens the door into your
house and activates your car could also be used by the cops, 
without asking for your cooperation. However, with biometry 
recently become viable this is only a very small worry. It would 
be nice to be able to talk to the transponder by tapping a code 
on your wrist, though. And to delete the id irreversibly (in 
case somebody wants to use torture on you). This is always the 
trouble with biometric devices not based on cryptographic 
authentication: you can't remove your signature without 
surgery, and everybody can read it. Somehow, I doubt life 
signatures will be so extremely resistant to forging. 
Fingerprints are extermely easy with removed digits or 
plastic casts (or even processed fingerprints clandestinely 
taken off with tape), iris is only slightly more difficult, 
as is retina.

<p>
Yes, essentially you wind carbon tape/epoxy on a polished, greased
thorn. Then bundle the straws in a cylindric container. For better 
structural integrity this should be a front loader (wire with 
slug/pyrocharge inserted frontally). If the electronics content 
is low, the thing won't show up on a metal seeker.

<p>
The pyrocharges gets ignited sequentially. A harder push on the
microswitch should trigger automated fire. The rounds should be really 
explosive ones.

<p>

<p>
One could make metal version of these for the shooting range. The
thing should be essentially a lethal equivalent of a can of mace. You
don't often practise with these.
