<p>
Depends on what "states" are and on what is in the constitution.  
You could say I'm describing a minimalist constitution with voluntarily
chosen "states."  

<p>
<i>&gt;The PPA-based system is likely to have more variety and less actual </i><br>
<a href="0157.html#0173qlink2">&gt;taxation, which might appeal to some people.  However, it would seem to </a><br>
<i>&gt;have two important defects:</i><br>
<i>&gt;First, police protection is available only to those who can pay for it.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;... Second, the PPA scenario offers nothing similar to the protections </i><br>
<i>&gt;of a bill of rights.  ...  It is not at all clear to me</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the market will force them to offer the kind of deal we really want -</i><br>
<i>&gt;they can easily collude with each other to fix prices, exempt themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt;from prosecution, crush small rivals through</i><br>
<i>&gt;assassination/bribery/blackmail, and so on.</i><br>

<p>
My minimalist proposal explicitly included PPA "anti-trust", which deals
with these collusion/crushing concerns.  

<p>
<a name="0185qlink1">My proposal was designed to set aside your "it won't work" objections 
and see if a core of paternalism remained.  Your concern that people 
won't choose to buy as much poverty insurance, police protection, or 
bills of rights as you think they aught seems exactly such a core of 
paternalism.  Even when it seems workable, you don't want to let other
folks make these choices for themselves.</a>
