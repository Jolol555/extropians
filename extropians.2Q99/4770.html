<a href="4767.html#4770qlink1">&gt;  Birth of a revolution As scientists find a way to choose the sex of unborn</a><br>
<i>&gt; calves, campaigners fear human babies could be next</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  They are the first cows in Europe to have their gender predetermined by</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientists who have perfected a way of separating male and female</i><br>
<i>&gt; chromosomes in cattle sperm.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It will allow Britain's 30,000 dairy farmers to choose to produce only</i><br>
<i>&gt; female calves, rather than having to waste money rearing unwanted males or</i><br>
<i>&gt; having them slaughtered at only a few days old.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Experts have admitted the same technique could be applied to human babies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; raising the prospect of parents choosing the sex of a child before</i><br>
<i>&gt; conception.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yesterday, concerns were being voiced over its ethical implications, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; there were calls for a ban on its use to determine the sex of human embryos.</i><br>
<i>&gt; At present around 600,000 unwanted dairy bulls are born each year in the UK,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and following the end of the veal export trade the vast majority are</i><br>
<i>&gt; slaughtered within days.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The three pioneering calves, named Charity, Clover and Chloe, were born on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; farm in Cheshire last month after having their gender pre- selected using</i><br>
<i>&gt; the advanced artificial insemination technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Every sperm carries either a male-producing Y chromosome or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; female-producing X chromosome, the latter carrying a slightly larger amount</i><br>
<i>&gt; of DNA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Computerised sensors pass a beam of light through each sperm, identifying</i><br>
<i>&gt; the 'males' and 'females' and separating them using a tiny positive or</i><br>
<i>&gt; negative magnetic charge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The method is 90 per cent reliable, which for farmers is a huge improvement</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the 50/50 gender split in natural births.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Scientists hope the technique will be commercially available within two</i><br>
<i>&gt; years, following trials carried out by Cogent, an English cattle-breeding</i><br>
<i>&gt; firm working with its American sister company XY Inc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Martin Hall, a spokesman for Cogent, said: 'This is an extraordinary</i><br>
<i>&gt; development in the history of cattle breeding. It is something that dairy</i><br>
<i>&gt; farmers have wanted for years.' Dairy farmer Paul Moore said since female</i><br>
<i>&gt; calves generally weigh less the technique would make first-time pregnancies</i><br>
<i>&gt; easier for cows. 'Sorted semen will reduce the number of unwanted bull</i><br>
<i>&gt; calves as well as the number of difficult births,' he said.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Each year the government spends millions of pounds subsidising the slaughter</i><br>
<i>&gt; and incineration of male calves, but widespread use of the processed sperm</i><br>
<i>&gt; would mean the doomed calves would not be born at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The National Farmers' Union has welcomed the technique, pointing to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefits to animal welfare as well as farmers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Two years ago the Farm Animal Welfare Council backed the use of such methods</i><br>
<i>&gt; to reduce the number of male calves going to the slaughterhouse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But their potential use in human births has sparked a fierce backlash from</i><br>
<i>&gt; pro-life campaigners.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Dr Mervin Jacobson, president of Colarado-based XY Inc., admitted:</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'Scientifically it's correct that humans are also mammals and therefore our</i><br>
<i>&gt; system would work on humans. But our own company is only licensed for</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-human mammals.' At present UK law forbids choosing the sex of an embryo</i><br>
<i>&gt; unless there are strong medical rather than social reasons. Some couples</i><br>
<i>&gt; have already exploited a legal loophole by sending sperm to America to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; processed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jack Scarisbrick, chairman of the charity Life, said yesterday: 'I am very</i><br>
<i>&gt; nervous of further manipulation of nature.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'In the past, advances have been tested on animals and later used in humans,</i><br>
<i>&gt; such as with in-vitro fertilisation. This latest manipulation of animal</i><br>
<i>&gt; births breaks down one more barrier.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'I fear it could lead to a form of consumerism, treating children as objects</i><br>
<i>&gt; produced to order, instead of as gifts we should welcome with love and awe.'</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mr Scarisbrick said it was already common in some countries to 'choose' the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sex of a child by aborting unwanted females.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'If you can argue that in cattle this technique saves the male calves from</i><br>
<i>&gt; slaughter, you could also argue that it would save baby girls from abortion,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or claim that the mother should have the freedom to choose.  'It is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; terribly dangerous road to start down.'</i><br>
