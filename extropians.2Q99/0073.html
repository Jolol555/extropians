I have on numerous occasions defended the same position that Anders did.
Interesting that you choose to ignore those posts. I do think that there is a
definite lower limit to the type of questions we tolerate being peppered with.
Dumb questions like 'why is the sky blue' or 'why is water wet?' or anything in
that milieu are not fit for the list, and the posters either need to use
existing references that are freely available or ask people in private or
elsewhere. Don't waste my time and money with your laziness.

<a href="0054.html#0073qlink2">&gt; Contrasting Michael Lorrey with the regular Extropian list member is in</a><br>

<i>&gt; There is plenty of that type of 'discussion' in the newsgroups. Let us</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep it there.</i><br>

<p>
I don't ask many questions of the list (I do ask some, rarely) for the following
reasons:


<OL>
  <li>  I have been on the list for over two years, and on the transhumanist list for
two years before that.
  <li>  I get a very decent stream of new information from the list that is posted by
people like Anders, and others, the science posts, etc. It is usually
informative, and if I have any questions about the science or whatever about
those posts, I will find the originators of the information and ask them. I
won't waste the time of the middlemen who usually don't know any more than they
passed along.
  <li>  I follow my own advice and ask people questions in private, so that I don't
clog the mail boxes of 300 other people with questions they have no ability,
time, or desire to engage in.


</OL>
<p>
Moreover I resent your claim that all I post is 'polemic and rhetoric'. I have
posted quite a bit of discussion on space development and cosmological topics, I
have bent over backwards to answer many basic questions that newbies have (far
mor than you Mr Archeros) and have posted verified science on topics regarding
gun use. My 'rhetoric' as you call it is merely calling the other side's bluff.
That you are positioned on the other side of the argument in that case and don't
like it and have to hide behind a cloak of anonymity as Mr. Archeros indicates
you are in a bit of denial.
