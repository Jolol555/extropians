<p>
That does not follow, since it is not really a function of per capita
income but rather technology. If you build a steelwork or chemical
factory based on modern principles rather than old principles it
becomes more efficient and less polluting. That means, if developing
nations get the chance to build these modern systems (which do not
necessarily have to be much more expensive), then there is no need to
deplete much.</a>

<p>
<a name="1390qlink3">Maybe the best thing to do for the environment would be to export or
give China, Indonesia, India and similar nations as much advanced
technology as possible, making them jump past the most crude and
polluting stages. Partially this appears to have happened in some of
the south-east asian countries, but never completely. And of course a
lot of politics gets in the way - I guess most Americans would not
want to see their nation *help* another become a great power, even if
they would in the long run gain</a> on it.

<i>&gt; Homo sapiens serves technology, rather than the reverse, we</a> risk unleashing</i><br>
<a name="1390qlink9"><i>&gt; a Frankensteinian superorganism. </i><br>

<p>
So who are we arguing against? If we look at the extropian principles
or transhumanist statement, it is clear that neither approves of
humans serving technology. Technocracy goes directly against the
extropian style.</a>

<i>&gt; science, and level-headed reason to test it, to verify it, and to make it</i><br>
<i>&gt; into knowledge.</i><br>

<p>
It would be nice to see this approach applied to other areas more,
both economics, politics and society as a whole. Just imagine the
results when people could empirically compare the effects of different
policies in a clear manner.</a>
