<p>
<a href="1203.html#1210qlink2">&gt; It might be usefull to point out here that we usually think in terms of</a><br>
<i>&gt; moving something a few thousand miles in a matter of days or weeks.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; ancients, OTOH, were usually moving things a few dozen miles over the course</i><br>
<i>&gt; of months or years.  If you think like the ancients, those amazing feats</i><br>
<i>&gt; suddenly start seeming a lot more doable.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1218qlink2">"think like the ancients" means "have a casual disregard for human</a> life and the
<a name="1218qlink3">ability to command tens of thousands of people to do whatever the hell you
</a>want"    :-)



<p>
<a href="1203.html#1210qlink3">&gt; &gt; I have also seen footage of engineers saying that it is technically</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; impossible to align a site as large as the Great Pyramid at Giza with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the accuracy the pyramid displays.  There's more to it than just moving</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rocks about.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, we're pretty sure we know how they did it.  You just need a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge of naked-eye astronomy, and lots of patience and attention to</i><br>
<i>&gt; detail.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1218qlink4">Um, please read my reply to Michael Lorry. I mean the foundations are extremely
square, edges and corners all line up, etc., to a very tiny degree of error.</a>


<p>
<a href="1203.html#1210qlink4">&gt; BTW - Surely you realize that in the modern world we can align a building to</a><br>
<i>&gt; essentially infinite precision?  (i.e. our instruments permit such high</i><br>
<i>&gt; precision that the thermal flexing of the building &amp; ground will produce</i><br>
<i>&gt; much larger errors than an imprecision of our measurements)</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1218qlink5">Do we? I know we can, but do we? Has anyone done this in practice?  The engineer
I saw quoted said that he builds very large buildings and it would be impossible
to align an object as large as the Great Pyramid</a> to the degree it is. Um, I
mean, make sure it is square etc. when I say align. Gah.


<p>
<a href="1203.html#1210qlink5">&gt; &gt; The vitrified forts in ireland?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Never heard of them.  Do you have a link?</i><br>

<p>
Nup, have a look. Large forts with walls made of rock heated until it fused into
a single block of glass.
