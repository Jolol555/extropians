I've mentioned Microvision (MVIS on NASDAQ) a couple of times recently as a 
personal investment I've made.  Microvision is developing Virtual Retinal 
Display (VRD) technology at a very fast rate, based on concepts originally 
developed at the University of Washington (my undergrad alma mater!) Human 
Interface Technology Laboratory (HITLab).  I believe that VRD technology is a 
key to the real advance of wearables and, especially, the significant 
development of virtual reality and "Enhanced Reality" (Sasha Chislenko's 
great term) applications.

<p>
The company has seen some significant developments this year and its stock 
price has almost doubled in the last few months.  Although I think serious 
take-off will probably not occur until next year, I'm betting heavily on this 
company to be a key player in the development of many businesses with a 
transhuman orientation during the first decade of the 21st century.

<p>
A few of the investors in Microvision maintain a fairly independent web site 
devoted to the company and its technology.  Recently, they've begun to 
publish a series of interviews with company executives.  The first can be 
found at:

This interview offers some good insight into the current state of the art and 
coming developments in display technology, as well as an interesting 
description of the management of development and financing of new 
technologies.
