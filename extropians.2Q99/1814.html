<a href="1797.html#1814qlink1">&gt;Actually, that's quite interesting. Enhanced evolution, yes, I can go</a><br>
<i>&gt;with that (although as an interested observer, since evolution from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual's perspective is all about being squashed like a bug, just</i><br>
<i>&gt;ask a bug).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My only problem with evolution is that it needs individual failure to</i><br>
<i>&gt;work. I'm not really interested in failing (lethaly) for the good of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;group, so I'm hoping there's a better way for humanity to move forward.</i><br>

<p>
sure...  lethal failing and aging are not suited for an enhanced
optimization of the human kind... so much to loose...
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1797.html#1814qlink2">&gt;I would make the statement that the forms of capitalism currently</a><br>
<i>&gt;practised in the world are not perfect. I hope others would agree. That</i><br>
<i>&gt;is not to say that they are necessarily fataly flawed. Just imperfect.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then the concept of enhanced evolution, when applied to the market (as</i><br>
<i>&gt;it would need to be, given imperfection), implies a path to "perfection"</i><br>
<i>&gt;littered with the corpses of the "failures".</i><br>

<p>
we can't bypass evolution laws... for myself i do believe that this whole
"enhanced" thing is quite redondant... enhanced evolution is just evolution.
no choice involved.... but i'm the by-product of an evil somewhat socialist
European state... and i'm victimized by the "there is not such thing as free
will" belief ;))).... I like your posts D. Musick ;) please keep posting
;))... you are the evolutionary catalyser kind of guy I like a lot to listen
very redondantly ...;)))

euh? so what ???... well i think alot about that... that's a good start ;))

<a name="1821qlink5"><a href="1797.html#1814qlink3">&gt;From the viewpoint of a long (infinitely long?) lived individual, there</a><br>
<i>&gt;is a big flaw in the idea of a competitive system. The flaw is that we</i><br>
<i>&gt;are all doomed to failure. If the probability of failure for us is</i><br>
<i>&gt;greater than zero in an evolutionary "trial", then it must approach 1</i><br>
<i>&gt;over time, as the number of trials increases. And the probability of</i><br>
<i>&gt;failure in a trial must be greater than zero, if just to account for</i><br>
<i>&gt;forces out of individual control.</a></i><br>

<p>
What would be the probability of your particular existence guessed from the
early big bang ?

<p>
who knows???

<p>
If the probability of failure tend to zero with time, for self-reproducing
entities, things becomes less simple. i would guess with time almost all the
universe could become "success"

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1797.html#1814qlink4">&gt;In my own individual, greedy, selfish way I think that this individual,</a><br>
<i>&gt;greedy, selfish economic system is a bum-deal, because it dooms me to</i><br>
<i>&gt;eventual (multiple) failure. If that failure can be fatal (and it can),</i><br>
<i>&gt;then I'm really worried.</i><br>

<p>
welcome to the world

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1797.html#1814qlink5">&gt;Hey, maybe we could cooperate. Oops, I've been watching too much Sesame</a><br>
<i>&gt;Street.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
a great idea ;)... what about the probability of failure for sets of people
;)?
