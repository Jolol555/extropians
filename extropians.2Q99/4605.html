<p>
Billy and Jocelyn Brown, I and other members of the Texas extropians group 
<br>
(a/k/a the "TEXtropians") are working on a project for Extropy Institute's <br>
(www.extropy.org) EXTRO4 conference (www.extropy.org/ex4/e4main.htm), to be <br>
held August 6-8 at the Joseph Wood Krutch Theater, University of California, 
Berkeley.

<p>
After dinner Saturday night, August 7, we will be hosting a broad discussion 
of near term (2000-2020) developments.  The first phase of this project is 
intended to be interactive with diverse sources of input from throughout the 
transhumanist community.  We are creating a web page for the purpose of 
collecting commentary on developments in science, technology and society over 
the next two decades. This web page will be available some time over the July 
4 weekend and will serve as an anchor to which comments can be appended using 
the Foresight Crit system.

<p>
After two weeks, we will shut down the web page for commentary and try to 
collate the input we've received into one or more timelines.  While material 
that follows the general format suggested by the scenario anchor page will be 
most welcome, comments of any form through the Crit system would be helpful 
and we'll try to incorporate as much as possible into this project.  

<p>
The material generated from the web site will be available for review and 
more commentary in the public areas of the conference throughout the EXTRO 
conference leading up to the discussion Saturday night.  Our presentation 
will commence with some commentary on the project up to that time and then 
moderated discussion with interested audience members making up the substance 
of the time we spend focusing on the ideas that have been developed.

<p>
Following EXTRO4, we will create as complete a synthesis of all of the 
foregoing efforts as we can and make the result into a hypertext installation 
available through Extropy Institute's web site.  

<p>
We'd like to get as much input as possible in the time available, so please 
be thinking about how you think technologies and issues in which you are 
interested will develop over the next twenty years and stop by the scenario 
development page next weekend and help us develop the clearest possible 
vision of the near future.
