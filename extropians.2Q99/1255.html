Headlining May's issue of Esquire, is "The First Immortal Man."  Sounds
like a takeoff of Jim Halperin's book "The First Immortal," but not quite
such a page turner.

<p>
"We are on the verge of becoming the first species to decide its own<br>
evolution" sounds like a line out of any extropian writings.  I don't know
the author, but he sure has been reading much of our writing, and could
even be on the extropian or transhuman list.  Are you here?

<p>
My favorite image is a guy shooting the bird at an image of death.  Cryo!
Drawing less response from me is an image of a guy having his brain replace
while a long-tongued structure (I think it was supposed to be a woman)
licks his facial cheek.   Anyway, I did like his brain being upgraded.

<p>
Articles are "Diary of an Immortal Man" by Richard Dooling, and "A World of
Immortal Men" by Edward O. Wilson.  

<p>
<a name="1268qlink1">(Wilson wrote _Consilience_ recently which I read with great enthusiasm
until the last chapter "To What End?" where he discusses volitional
evolution and seems to favor humans remaining biological.)</a>
