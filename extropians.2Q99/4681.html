It wasn't somebody dragging him to court that I was worried about.

<a name="4689qlink1">I've considered changing my name to outrun some posts I made when I was
twelve or thereabouts, but I've got a different email address now and
thus "plausible deniability".  Probably I should create an "alternate

Eliezer" to claim that past self, just in case.

<p>
Nothing incriminating, just stuff that's not up to my current standards
of post quality.

Probably in the future, people will change their name on their 18th
birthday, then again on their 35th birthday, to outrun their life as
recorded on the 'Net.  That poor girl with a birth condition that
necessitated the replacement of all her skin, with, as it so happens,
skin grown from a circumcized foreskin.  Her idiot parents let the idiot
researchers use her real name in the idiot press release on Eurekalert,
so almost any 'Net search is going to turn it up.  Can you imagine the
amount of ribbing that poor girl is going to go through, probably
starting in kindergarten?  Anyway, I was envisioning things more along
the lines of prospective employers, security-clearance checkers, and so
on, not prosecutors.
