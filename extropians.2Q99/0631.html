My rationalization for this act of pure laziness and/or stinginess is that
according to the stats, if I die in the next two decades it is most likely
to be something which leaves my brain in a useless state, and anything else
that happens is likely to give me plenty of a heads up that I will have time
to sign up for suspension before it kills me. Cryonics is a last ditch
option, which IMHO is most likely to be used by the oldsters on the list
than the youngsters. Caveat: I will probably sign up sometime in the next
ten years anyways if I wind up having a wife and kids that will make it much
more worthwhile to come back</a> to.

<a name="0654qlink1">I would only suggest that you maintain a life insurance policy</a> that would be
<a name="0654qlink2">sufficient to pay for cryopreservation, keeping in mind</a> that prices may
<a name="0654qlink3">increase as different and more effective protocols</a> are developed (one reason
<a name="0654qlink4">to sign up now).  But if something happens that prevents</a> you from increasing
<a name="0654qlink5">your coverage (e.g. heart attack) then you may be stuck.  It's</a> true that the
<a name="0654qlink6">average cryonicist is older than most, but the young</a> are poor planners in
<a name="0654qlink7">general when it comes to life-long goals (e.g. insurance,</a> retirement, etc).
<a name="0654qlink8">It's just difficult for them to appreciate the need to plan</a> on the next 60
<a name="0654qlink9">years when they only have twenty under their belt.  Since</a> you mention a
<a name="0654qlink10">possible future spouse/partner and your possible desire to return</a> to them,
<a name="0654qlink11">that brings up some potentially thorny issues, doesn't it?

<p>
<a name="0651qlink1"><a name="0636qlink2">How long do you all think marriages will last in a world</a> where everyone is
<a name="0654qlink12">ageless.  I know I'm not going to let the preacher include,</a> "Till death do
<a name="0654qlink13">us part." in the vows.  I suspect that the average marriage</a> in the future
would last for a shorter period of time than it does today.</a>  To be blunt and
<a name="0654qlink14">insensitive, I think that many people stay in a relatively loveless
relationship as they get older because they feel there are no</a> other options.
<a name="0654qlink15">Well, there'll be plenty of options if you're not aging.  Plus,</a> time changes
</a>
<a name="0654qlink16">everyone, so the more time...the more change...the further apart</a> you are
<a name="0654qlink17">likely to grow.  I don't see anything wrong with this.  When</a> it comes to
<a name="0654qlink18">*shoulds*, I only believe that couples *should* try</a> to maintain respectful,
<a name="0654qlink19">commited, and hopefully loving relationships until their</a> children are grown.
<a name="0654qlink20">Even though lots of very psychologically healthy kids have grown</a> up in a
<a name="0654qlink21">single-parent houselhold, my experience suggests that two</a> parents provide
<a name="0654qlink22">greater levels of support and stability (getting off topic, now).

<p>
<a name="0636qlink3">Another thorny cryonics issue is the benficiary issue.  Spouses</a> can easily
<a name="0654qlink23">become upset with the idea that you've established a cryonics</a> firm as the
<a name="0654qlink24">beneficiary of your life insurance policy instead of the family.</a>  Ideally,
<a name="0654qlink25">you could maintain two policies, but what if you only had</a> the resources to
<a name="0654qlink26">maintain one policy?  Who would the beneficiary be?  OK,</a> now consider this
<a name="0654qlink27">analogy:<a name="0658qlink1">  You've been told by your doctors that your only chance</a> to live
<a name="0654qlink28">requires an experimental medical procedure costing over $100,000</a> and with a
<a name="0654qlink29">10% chance of success.  Would your spouse insist that you *not*</a> have the
</a>
<a name="0654qlink30">operation so that the family could have the money?  Would</a> you agree or would
<a name="0654qlink31">you fight for your life?
</a>
