I think Imperial China is the classic example.  They gained and lost
technologies over and over.  My theory is that because they only have one
ideograph per word, they can't easily extend the written language and
keep innovations in their  literature.

<p>
They also had a command economy for long periods of time, which can
discourage innovation.  Especially if people in progressive times
couldn't read the old books about inventions.

<p>
Additionally, they never achieved an industrial revolution because their
population always grew in tandem with their technology, so that they
never had enough capital surplus to fuel an industrial revolution.

<p>
Brad Delong at UC Berkeley Economics has an interesting paper about the
industrial revolution on his web site.  He's an historical economist. 
<a name="2852qlink1">Apparently the industrial revolution in England was a very rare,
anomalous event, that almost didn't happen.  By luck or a blessing of
God, England came late to the nasty wars of the 17th century, and all of
England's classes (Protestants all) were threatened with extinction (by
Catholic Invasion threats).  The universal threat permitted progressive
taxation, including taxation of the nobles.  The lateness and
progressive-ness of the war taxation permitted ENgland to save up reserve
capital, enough, barely, for the industrial revolution to snowball into
Victorian England.</a>
