I agree with you completely, as it happens. However, some people clearly
believe that this messenging service is of value to them.

<p>
I would say just drop person "x" into your kill fill, but you may not find
that a fine enough grained response. You really want to drop postings of
type "x", especially if from person is list {1,2,3} into the kill file.

<p>
<a name="4078qlink1">What this list needs is informative subject lines:</a> unfortunately, only a
human can recognise the appropriate patterns and that would be a full time
job and still not get the right answer for everyone.

Posters can do a service for lovers and dislikers both by always including a
key word in their re-mailing posts. - like [news] you can kill or highlight
on that easy enough. We could publish a list of key words and the list
server could mail back to people

<p>
"I was unable to classify your post. here is the list of known key words.
...

<p>
If you think a word should be added ... mail to the list with "vote for new
word" in your subject.

<p>
Your mail has been posted just fine, but be aware that it will receive a low
priority in many people's mail readers as the tag word &lt;not classified&gt; has
been added to the subject line.

<p>
This is v.easy for the server (it will already be scanning for list
unsubscribe info etc.) If it is useless, we have lost nothing. If it is
great well ...

<p>
Filters also do not have be black and white kill or live entities.

<p>
I have a filter item which says if from = x and body contains "reuters ..."
then color "light gray" and mark as read and grade as "unimportant", simply
because I will myself in all probability have read that item. It is not
killed, but is tagged as easy too skip over. This sort of local action can
give you a highly interesting and readable list.

<p>
There may even be a role for a web site of filters. We could trade filter
sets and people could have a starter set for libertarians etc ;-)
cheers,
