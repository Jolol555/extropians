<a href="1663.html#1670qlink1">"If he actually beleives many of the things he spews here, he is, in</a><br>
fact, IMHO, an evil person."

<p>
<a name="1714qlink1">Please provide quotes of what evil things I have spewed here.  You
continue to assert that what I have written contradicts the viewpoints of
others on this list, yet you do not back up your statements with any
facts.  What have I actually written that you are in such disagreement
</a></a>with?  

<p>
<a name="1677qlink2">My compliments on you straw-man building techniques, though.  I  am also
grateful that you have revealed your basically violent and hostile nature
so publicly so that I and others know now to avoid you for our own
safety.</a>

Thank you for your attention,
