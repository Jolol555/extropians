<a href="0829.html#0833qlink1">&gt;The MMPI scale Jocelyn is referring to was less revealing in terms of</a><br>
<i>&gt;sex-role identities.</i><br>


<p>
Like I said, I don't know for sure that the test I took to establish my
gender traits was the MMPI. I think it may have been an entirely different
test. I have just taken so many of them over the past ten years that I
forget which was which. I took the gender characteristic test around 4 years
ago, and I know that I took the test specifically for that reason. It asked
a lot of questions, I think rated something like 1-5 to represent a little
to a lot of agreement. The only specific question I remember was dealing
with which magazine I'd rather read: a car magazine or a family-circle style
magazine. Then again, it might not have had a rating scale -- it may have
been an either-or thing. I just don't remember. Any ideas?
