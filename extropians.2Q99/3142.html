<i>&gt; This is probably going to sound like a dirty question, but would the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government</i><br>
<i>&gt; have enough money to function based only on a sales tax? I'm no fan of</i><br>
<i>&gt; government</i><br>
<i>&gt; expansion, but there ARE certain essential services that governments</i><br>
<i>&gt; currently</i><br>
<i>&gt; provide.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, one likely response is that the government can and should</i><br>
<i>&gt; function on</i><br>
<i>&gt; dramatically less money, providing correspondingly less "essential"</i><br>
<i>&gt; services.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Or the government could subsidize advertising, with the end result that more
money is spent, and more tax is collected.

<a href="3135.html#3142qlink2">&gt; Even if everyone were to decide tomorrow to completely privatize every</a><br>
<i>&gt; single</i><br>
<i>&gt; government department, the government would have to keep functioning</i><br>
<i>&gt; during the</i><br>
<i>&gt; transition period.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's not just a matter of deciding what the ideal system would be. We also</i><br>
<i>&gt; need a</i><br>
<i>&gt; plan for the orderly transition/decentralization of power. Given the</i><br>
<i>&gt; current</i><br>
<i>&gt; American system of government, how WOULD you gradually eliminate/down</i><br>
<i>&gt; size/decentralize the government without massive drops in service levels,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or</i><br>
<i>&gt; massive unemployment. (Sad fact: when a given agency employs a significant</i><br>
<i>&gt; portion of the population, their elimination makes a significant change to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; unemployment figures).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Aren't those great big monuments in Washington DC the result of a government
spending program which was conceived primarily for the purpose of
manipulating the economy?

<a href="3135.html#3142qlink3">&gt; Big government can be likened to a drug addiction. Going off it cold</a><br>
<i>&gt; turkey can</i><br>
<i>&gt; have dramatic negative health effects for the system as a whole, as bad or</i><br>
<i>&gt; worse</i><br>
<i>&gt; as the effects of remaining addicted. Given that simply firing all</i><br>
<i>&gt; government</i><br>
<i>&gt; officials one day would cause a brief period of anarchy followed by some</i><br>
<i>&gt; form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; dictatorship almost certainly worse then the current system, how do we</i><br>
<i>&gt; escape it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Don't worry, apparently the state's just going to wither away, although I
can't get my hands on a schedule, they said next month maybe, or next year.
I hope it doesn't wither so much that they can't get the schedule out.

Australian, yeah big government (could be a bit bigger in my opinion),
talking about the US for no particular reason that I can see. I've done
better than this before, haven't I? Oh well.
