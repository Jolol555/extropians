I'd just like to point out - to avoid any confusion - these people did *not*
have sex in space.  I very much doubt anyone has: NASA would require years
of research before they would allow it and there would be practical problems
like sweat build-up that already dog zero-gee exercise.  They are, however,
planning to mate rats in space at the cost of many millions of tax dollars.
