Indeed; there's no requirement to be a (big-L) Libertarian. However, a
belief in spontaneity and individualism is of itself a (small-l) 
libertarian position, whether libertarian capitalist, libertarian socialist
or whatever. 

<p>
I've been on and off the list since 1993; when I first subscribed, it 
was a haven for freedom-loving, future-thinking "libertarian gun-nuts"
where we didn't have to waste time debating all the usual authoritarian 
crap we get in day-to-day life.<a name="2645qlink1"> Today most of the original members are 
long gone, seemingly replaced with Borganists who want to forcibly 
reprogram people to turn the Earth into "Happy Fluffy World"</a> where 
everyone is nice to each other and conflict never happens; so much 
for individualism.

<p>
Fortunately, deleting all Joe's posts has made the list a lot better
(I still don't know how he got out of my kill file -- oh, it's a crappy
Microsoft program, no wonder), but I think it's probably about time for 
me to go too; I'll give it another couple of weeks and see if anything 
improves. Anyone know if there's a list today equivalent to the old 
Extropians list?
