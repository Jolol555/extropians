Well they are making at least a bit of effort: the data
stream is encrypted. The main missing pieces are still:
recording screen images to tape or photograph, mem dump, screen
capture via running Windows on an emulator. Since recording
to tape or photo involves a digital-&gt;analog conversion, let's
throw that out since you effectively do not have the original
data. (actually of course even a monitor display is analog
unless you're using a flatpanel with a digital interface)

<p>
Anyway, if this ever got to the point where it was distributed
with the browsers or built-in, then I could see many web
sites switching to it in order to prevent a lot of casual
theft.

<p>
This same problem is also being worked on in the audio/MP3
arena; I wonder how that new SDMI (correct acronym?) is going
to try to handle it.
