Abstract
<br>
  In the past, lipoic acid has been administered to patients
  and test animals as therapy for diabetic neuropathy and various
  intoxications. Lipoic acid and the vitamin
  biotin have structural similarities. We sought to determine
  whether the chronic administration of lipoic acid affects
  the activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases. For 28 d,
  rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of one of the following: 1) a
  small dose of lipoic acid [4.3 micromol/( kg.d)]; 2) a large
  dose of lipoic acid [15.6 micromol/(kg.d)]; or 3) a large
  dose of lipoic acid plus biotin [15.6 and
  2.0 micromol/(kg.d), respectively]. Another group received n-hexanoic
  acid [14.5 micromol/(kg.d)], which has structural
  similarities to lipoic acid and biotin and
  thus served as a control for the specificity of lipoic acid.
  A fifth group received phosphatidylcholine in saline injections and served as
  the vehicle control. The rat livers were assayed for the activities of
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and
  beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. Urine was analyzed for lipoic
  acid; serum was analyzed for indicators of liver damage and
  metabolic aberrations. The mean activities of pyruvate carboxylase and
  beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase were 28-36% lower in the lipoic
  acid-treated rats compared with vehicle controls (P &lt; 0.05).
  Rats treated with lipoic acid plus biotin
  had normal carboxylase activities. Carboxylase activities in livers of
  n-hexanoic acid-treated rats were normal despite some
  evidence of liver injury. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase and acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase were not significantly affected by administration of lipoic
  acid. This study provides evidence consistent with the
  hypothesis that chronic administration of lipoic acid lowers
  the activities of pyruvate carboxylase and beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA
  carboxylase in vivo by competing with biotin.

  Additional note by poster:

<p>
    High dose lipoic acid is less effective than low dose in the treatment
  of diabetic neuropathy. This may be due to an induced marginal biotin
  deficiency. Megadose biotin itself has been found to be significantly 
  more effective than lipoic acid in treatment of diabetics.
