<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now who is knee jerking? The context that I used the word, with no knowledge of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; particular political correctness of the word in a region on the opposite side of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; planet from me, was merely as a means of abbreviating.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sure.  But once you have been told it has racist connotations, why bring</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it up again?  Why not just let it lie?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We were having a discusion about knee-jerk responses to use of words taken out of context.</i><br>
<i>&gt; My point has been that there are so many different historical contexts that for a person to</i><br>
<i>&gt; jump to such conclusions is rude and insulting in and of itself. We could have just let it</i><br>
<i>&gt; lie at that, but you seem to prefer to continue the rudeness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Its also quite convenient for you to ignore my italian ancestry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sorry, last time I checked, Italians were caucasian.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Only in a general sense. Most bigoted types who are northern european descendants  do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; beleive so, especially italians of sicilian descent, who are considered by bigots of</i><br>
<i>&gt; northern extraction to be not much different from blacks. If I were as knee jerk and</i><br>
<i>&gt; over-sensitive as you I'd consider your ignorance of this fact to be rather bigoted of you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Even today in many parts of the US, when people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; find out you are italian and from the east coast, they automatically think you are in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the mafia. When my grandfather married an italian girl in the 1930's, his family</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; would not talk to him for years, prejudice was so widespread back then. To most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; WASPs, being white means being of NORTHERN european descent, and specifically of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; English descent. Anyone who is not ignorant of history knows what the English did to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Scots after Culloden. Apparently you are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Oh get a grip, will you? Who is talking about WASPS? As I said to you,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; if you were to use such a word to a group of aborigines over here, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will be offended. The fact that you are *italian* will not calm them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; down much at all. All they will see is yet another offensive white dude</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; having a go at them. Shit, that's all I see reading this email.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which is, as I said, total knee jerking and being totally ignorant of other historical</i><br>
<i>&gt; contexts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And I'll wager I have a FAR greater understanding of history than you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;From what I've seen so far, not bloody likely.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I was talking with some freinds the other day about this, and we were mocking the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; demands of a few years ago for apologies to the african americans. At the same time</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; their ancestors were getting enslaved by the British, my Scottish ancestors were</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; getting exterminated by the British. Why the hell should I, or my representatives,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; have to apologize to them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is SUCH complete bullshit. The Scots weren't locked up in chains</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and carted off to the other side of the planet. To even attempt to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; compare what happened to the scots to what happened to negroes is so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; obviously fatuous as to render me, um, speechless.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On the contrary, my scottish ancestors were locked up and carted off to the Hebrides and to</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nova Scotia, and their land was seized so that English lords could make more profits off of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the breeding of sheep. All commoner women were subject to the English policy of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Primogeniture, which meant that the king, the local lord, or his agent had the right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have intercourse with any newly married woman before the husband could consummate the</i><br>
<i>&gt; marriage. This was the enactment of old Longshanks' complaint that "The problem with</i><br>
<i>&gt; Scotland is that its full of Scots."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think this is an ample example of how little you understand history.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; None of my ancestors even came to the US until after the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; civil war. One of my buddies noted that his danish ancestors were held under martial</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; law by the Swedes way back when, so I summarily apologized to him for the actions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; my Swedish ancestors on his Danish ancestors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Can I just quickly interject into the midst of this foam and ask you:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; what the hell has this to do with you not calling aborigines "abos"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I could counter by saying that what does my use of the term, even though I've never been</i><br>
<i>&gt; anywhere near Austrialia or known an Aborigine, have anything to do with how pissed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Aborigines may be at the way Aussies have treated them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now I suppose if you REALLY stretch it, I would have to apologize for my Roman Empire</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; ancestors and what they did to the Carthaginians, the Egyptians, the Jews, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; French, and the British. Let me say right here: I am truly sorry people I never met</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; or gained an ounce of benefit from opressed people you never met or gained an ounce</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; of benefit from. Happy now?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Without getting too far into personal flames, you are a fucking twit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Since this isn't the first time you've descended to personal flames, insults, and general</i><br>
<i>&gt; bad language, you're already a bit far into it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Where did I say you should feel responsible for ANYTHING other than your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; own actions? Why did this come into it? I mentioned that the word "abo"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is considered rude here.  You come back, as usual, with something</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; totally unrelated to what I wrote. Are you incapable of addressing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; issues people raise with you, too stupid to understand the difference,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or too devious to care?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I addressed the topic, and you still felt like coming back with a rude threat as to how</i><br>
<i>&gt; some Queensland natives would treat me. The only one being rude here is you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Do you have any idea how many people killfile you, Michael?  Is it a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lot? You are the only person on this list I have considered doing it to,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and one of the rare people on the net to bring me to such a conclusion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Congratulations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only people who may killfile me are people I probably wouldn't care to converse with</i><br>
<i>&gt; much anyways, or are people who are just to busy to deal with the obnoxious individuals I</i><br>
<i>&gt; take it upon myself to deal with.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
And how well do you deal with yourself, Michael?
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2776.html#2828qlink2">&gt; &gt; I haven't done so as yet because you *appear* to have a brain, but this</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; complete inability to stick to the point is too annoying for words.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At this point, I'm wondering what YOUR point is. You seem to have lost it.</i><br>
