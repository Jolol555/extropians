<a name="2785qlink1">Problem is, I can't bring myself to actually delete e-mails. Even with
those which appear devoid of content, there somehow seems less content
if the message is deleted. Perhaps this is like the difference between 0
and NULL.</a>

<p>
I don't like losing information, and I think there could be information
in the noise somewhere, even if only at a meta^n level (MANY thanks to
T.0.Morrow for your posts along this line, it expressed an idea that I
was having trouble crystalising).

<p>
<a name="2785qlink2">I am finding, however, that I am having to run searches to find past
e-mails to which I would like to respond/refer, because the shear volume
has rendered my vertical scroll bar useless. I've got to find a way
around this, because I'm using MSExchange, and the find mechanism is
severly limited*.</a>

PS: I've got an idea in mind for a generator (kinetic -&gt; electrical
energy), powered by typing. Maybe this would make flamewars useful,
because sheer volume of material is more important than content. I think
it could even have a little feedback loop by powering a coffee machine
next to the keyboard (typing+sending a flamewar post powers coffee
machine brews coffee raises stress level / lowers non-linear thinking in
typist increases agitation due to response to original post + all other
flamewar posts generates response-to-(response-to(original post)) post
which is more beligerent than original post, go back to the beginning.

<p>
Actually, I think the guys in the electrical control room here would be
pissed about this idea, because of the potential for load to spiral out
of control. Maybe when load gets too high, you can help individual
postors to meet in person, which should lower overall flame-post volume
because of violent deaths (esp. in "guns" related flamewars).

<p>
Before anyone else brings it up, did anyone see the april fools day joke
from Compaq this year about the "dyna-mouse", which is supposed to power
the laptop to which it is connected by converting kinetic energy from
the user's hand movements into electricity? I was fooled by it. It was
very slick though, really! (no, really!)

<p>
Hey, I think I'll invent a bullshit-&gt;electricity convertor, and make a
fortune... no, that's just the keyboard-generator above, but used by me.
damn.
