<a name="0227qlink2">On a more serious note, my father is massively emphysemic, and on constant oxygen,</a> and has extensive skin cancer.  He supports Dr. K., but my mother, who is diabetic, has high blood pressure, glaucoma and arthritic hips, opposes him.  If A = an intolerable medical condition and B = the desire to die to escape it, clearly A+B must inhere for assisted suicide to be legitimate.  It is also clear that the family's wishes should be irrelevant, whether they are in favor of or opposed to such action - they may live WITH the person in question, but only the person in question lives inside the condition; therefore only the person in question should have the right to decide whether or not to leave it.
