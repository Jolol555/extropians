<a name="3295qlink1"><a name="3101qlink1">In turn, I agree with your point as well.  A child should always be
supervised around any dangerous equipment, whether it is a hot stove or a
gun.  I was not trying to imply that a five year old is capable of handling
a gun responsibly on their own without supervision.  Generally speaking, a
five year old should never be allowed to handle a firearm except in
strictly controlled environments.  However, you can teach them enough that
when unexpected situations occur (perhaps due to some other parents
irresponsibility), there is a high probability that they will respond
appropriately.
