<a href="0763.html#0766qlink1">&gt;Gina, I think you're confusing gender with sexual preference.  I'm </a><br>
not referring to one's sexual orientation.  I'm referring to your 
self-concept in terms of sexual identity.  I once treated a man who 
wanted a sex change but fully intended on being a lesbian after the 
operation.  He was a lesbian trapped in a man's body!  I started 
thinking...hmmm, how do I know _I'm_ not a lesbian trapped in a man's 
body?   I mean, _I_ like women!  The difference, of course, was that 
he felt like a woman inside, not a man.

<p>
Yes I understand that, and what I'm talking abou itsn't sexual 
orientation, but I did refer to sexual orientation to justify that 
with future technology, there may be alot of differences in sexual 
identity. You see if one can become something else, sexually, they 
will, there will be a diversity just as there is in todays natural 
world. You see what I'm saying? [See the lower comments for further 
explaination.]

I respond:
<br>
You could date a woman thats curious as to what it's like being a 
man. 
<br>
Although, I was thinking that thing's would be more interchangable, 
than "okay I want to be a man," so I have to change everything and 
then what do I do? I'd just revert back, or play around until I found 
something I liked. Although in the real world, I like being me!
 Okay, here it is:

I keep thinking back to some selections in Drexler's books where he 
states in the nanotech future kids could go to the store and buy 
these "nano toy packets" where a kid could just buy one and become 
molecular manipulated into a monster or a clown or a big huge ugly 
monster for a day, but this mutation doesn't stay forever. In fact 
wear's off in a 12-24 hour or other predicted time. I am thinking on 
this sort of line with the alteration's sexually also.We adults could 
have the same type of "toys" available to us, but with different 
applications. (the kind you use when the kids are in bed, and so are 
you)
