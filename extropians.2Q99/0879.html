<p>
I'd like to apologize to the list as a whole and to those individuals
that received that message personally.
<br>
When I got the original message it seemed somewhat of a hoot and also a
symbolic way of tweaking the oil monopolies, I intended to forward it
_only_ to people in my personal address book but obviously didn't delete
all the references I should have.
<br>
For what it's worth, all copies were sent as 'Blind Copy' so I don't
think I've compromised anyone.
<br>
Again, my apologies, I goofed :-}.
