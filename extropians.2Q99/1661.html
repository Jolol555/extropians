Strictly speaking, we don't have much data either way.  It doesn't appear to
be practical to predict the behavior of matter under such conditions using
our current models, and we don't have any handy samples to experiment with.

<p>
That's why I said it would be a delicate process.  You'd have to do a lot of
number crunching to find a temperature/pressure regime in which complex
structures are stable enough to work with, and then you'd have to build a
structure that can maintain such an environment for long periods of time.

<p>
The payoff in terms of increased component density would be huge, of course,
but the scale of the engineering involved leads me to suspect its a moot
point.  By the time we could do something like that we'll be an SI
civilization, and we'll probably have much better ideas.
