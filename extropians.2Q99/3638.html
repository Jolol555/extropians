My complaint about the new and improved warpdrive is that it is a
designer metric - it is designed to work as a warp drive, but there is
no attempt to derive it from physically possible field distributions
and the field equations. So it might be utterly impossible to
build.<a name="3686qlink1"> That is why I get happy each time I see a wormhole paper that
sneaks around a few more of the energy conditions - that makes the
construction more physically likely.</a> But what we need is a paper
showing an existence proof that some field configuration in roughly
flat spacetime can fold together into some custom geometry we want -
and that is still lacking.

<i>&gt;  David Zindell's "computational origami" is looking more plausible all</i><br>

<i>&gt; pockets, and then they all communicate with each other in this</i><br>
<i>&gt; meta-Jupiter brain.  And, while I don't know if physics would permit, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; see no reason why you couldn't fold up the meta-Jupiter brain and have</i><br>
<i>&gt; meta-meta-Jupiter brains.  I hereby dub this the Fractal Tardis Brain.</i><br>

<p>
Noted. I think you are using origami differently from Zindell though,
I got the impression that he meant having computer programs that did
several different things with the same code - a bit like the
Obfuscated C Contest programs we see from time to time.

<p>
My problem with this structure is getting energy into it and entropy
out of it - heat dissipation has been a major limiting factor in most
of my jupiter brain designs, and it gets even worse inside Tardis
pockets. If you could economically blow up open "pockets" to dissipate
into, then things would get very nice - although classical
thermodynamics would have to be thrown out of the window!
