But what kind of 'good life' do they desire? If two groups have entirely

<p>
And what of those whose idea of a 'good life' does not involve spending
their time working to provide a 'good life' for others?

<p>
Humanity *is* limited to this solar system for decades to come; and even
if we do leave it we won't be able to acquire resources fast enough in
other solar systems to allow everyone to have everything they could desire.

"If no-one wanted anything, who would want anything?" Duh.

<p>

<p>
You think the Israelis and Arabs will be happy to each have a duplicate
of Jerusalem, rather than the real city?

<p>
Many of the tasks you want to eliminate will require human-level sentience.
What exactly is the benefit of enslaving a human-level sentience made of
silicon so that a human-level sentience made of goop doesn't have to do
the work?

<p>
<a href="1580.html#1582qlink7">&gt;The achievement of a higher level of increased conscious-being may</a><br>

<i>&gt;reality.</i><br>

<p>
And if they refuse to do it in VR and choose to become a dictator for
real?
