<a name="3478qlink1">In a discussion recently the topic came up about an experiment in the US
which involved a sealed mini-ecosystem replete with people, to see if the
closed system was viable, or for how long, or something like</a> that. Was this
kicked off in the 70s?

Obviously my memory of this thing is quite poor. Does anyone have any
recollection? I can't really look it up on the net, because I can't remember
what it was called (subject line is my best guess).

(It came up related to living in Canberra, Australia (the nation's
capital!!!). It's the cultural version of the above closed system experiment
in my opinion, and I think the entropy has increased beyond the ability to
sustain a human (intellectual) life).
