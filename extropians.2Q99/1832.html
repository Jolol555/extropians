Can't? Let's see now... 'Bill Gates is evil'. Yup, I did it. Obviously we 
can call people evil without getting blasted by lightning bolts from above.

So what? In his case he's just another borganist who wants a wonderful
future society where everyone thinks just like him and all dissension has

Seriously, you don't think that wanting to replace the diversity of life 
with bazillions of clones of yourself is evil?
