<i>&gt;&gt; The big advantage of ufog is that it provides many of the advantages of</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; general-purpose assemblers are ubiquitous.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is often easier to rely on finished products than having the</i><br>

<p>
Doesn't that cover just about every member of this list?
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="1778.html#1794qlink2">&gt;&gt; However, it also looks like ufog is pretty hazardous by itself.  Think of</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the lung disease that could be caused by misprogrammed ufog.</i><br>

<a name="1819qlink2"><i>&gt;The problem seems to be that it is impossible to test very complex</i><br>
<i>&gt;systems for all possible contingencies, and this will likely cause</i><br>
<i>&gt;trouble when designing ufog. How do you convince the customers it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;perfectly safe? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="1798qlink1">I don't think its going to be all that difficult to convince customers
that these things are safe particularly - ufog sounds like the
consumer's dream, and its incredible appeal as the ultimate in consumer
durables must outstrip fear of its danger (even if that fear is well
founded).<a name="1819qlink3"> Is ufog more dangerous than a car? Than having guns around the
</a>
house? Than having cleaning products in your laundry?</a></a>

<a href="1778.html#1794qlink3">&gt;You get the same problem with AI: what testing would be required</a><br>
<i>&gt;before an AI program was allowed to completely run a nuclear power</i><br>
<i>&gt;plant? Most likely a lot, and even then I guess insurance premiums</i><br>
<i>&gt;would go up and if somethind did go wrong people would be sued to</i><br>
<i>&gt;hell. But having humans is allright, as long as they have had a</i><br>
<i>&gt;certain education and passed certain less stringent tests.</i><br>

<p>
What's the benefit of running a nuclear power plant with an AI. Cheaper
power? If it is, it'll turn up somewhere with low restrictions (eastern
europe?) and either work well for a long enough time to convince the
world of its safety, or some power stations will blow up and the whole
thing will take a bit longer. It'll  get there eventually though. The
space shuttle is flying again, after all.
