<a name="0500qlink1"><a name="0494qlink1">Well, as soon as it is possible to overcome the strong nuclear and repulsion
forces to actually modify an atom's atomic weight and its electrons, then any
matter could be formed into any other matter.</a>  I don't fully understand the
dynamics of transmuting elements.

<a name="0500qlink2">This is similar to the idea of a nano-scale assembler, but perhaps a little
smaller.  It would be similar to an "alchemy" machine in that alchemy's
famous goal is turning lead into gold, but otherwise has nothing to do with
alchemy.  Perhaps it could be called an "absolute assembler".

<p>
<a name="0494qlink2">If that is not possible (it is not likely to be possible any time soon), a
couple of bags of rust would do.</a>

<a name="0494qlink3">Silicon possesses very similar qualities to carbon in terms of electron
stability, and it would be likely that, for example, buckyballs and nanotubes
could be made from silicon, as well as higher level structures like
diamondoid structural building materials.</a></a>
