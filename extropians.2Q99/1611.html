<a href="1564.html#1611qlink1">&gt;A fascinating and attractive idea.  Because I ride my bicycle on the</a><br>
<i>&gt;street often, and because I have frequently been reminded of the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;that large numbers of motorists drive as though I am not there, I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;often longed for this ability.  But, like always, I must make do with</i><br>
<i>&gt;what I have, so I have spent a lot of time developing my sense of hearing</i><br>
<i>&gt;and my ability to generate a rough model of my surroundings based on</i><br>
<i>&gt;auditory information.  Now when I hear cars around me, I have a much</i><br>
<i>&gt;better knowledge of where they are, how fast they are moving and which</i><br>
<i>&gt;direction they are moving.</i><br>

Did you see the stuff about Steve Mann posted earlier? An excerpt from 
"Cyborg Seeks Community" posted by Gina Miller:

<p>
Every morning I decide how I will see the world that day. Sometimes I
give 
<br>
myself eyes in the back of my head. Other days I add a sixth sense, such
as 
<br>
the ability to feel objects at a distance. If I'm going to ride my
bicycle, 
<br>
I'll want to feel the cars and trucks pressing against my back, even
when 
<br>
they are a few hundred feet away.

<p>
...

<p>
While at McMaster, I added biosensors to the WearComp so that it could 
monitor my heart rate (as well as the full EKG waveform) and other 
physiological signals. I also invented the "vibravest"-a garment studded
with radar transceivers and vibrating elements. Wearing this vest made 
objects at a distance feel as if they were pressing against my body. I
could 
<br>
close my eyes and walk down the hallway, confident that any wall or
other 
<br>
obstacle would be felt as warning vibrations on the appropriate side of
the 
<br>
vest. By sparing myself from the cognitive load of processing all that 
visual information, I found I was able to think more clearly.

<p>
(I am assuming that this stuff is real - it blows my mind)
