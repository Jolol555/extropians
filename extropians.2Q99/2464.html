<a href="1403.html#2464qlink1">&gt; From: Michael S. Lorrey &lt;mike@lorrey.com&gt;</a><br>
 
<p>
<a href="2443.html#2464qlink2">&gt; The difficulty with non-lethal protective technologies, like stun guns, is the</a><br>
<i>&gt; dosage. The voltage/amperage that it takes to immobilize the biggest person has</i><br>
<i>&gt; a high risk of killing outright the smallest person. Defaulting your settings</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the smallest person will merely piss off the big person who is likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt; hurt you most.</i><br>

<p>
Consequently, you'll fit the gun with various settings (and perhaps a "kill"
setting too), just like a real phaser. A sliding knob with a comprehensive
power indicator next to it would do just fine (might be an idea for regular
stun guns too). 
 
<p>
 &gt; A good non-lethal tech would  have to be a smart dart that uses body capacitance
<br>
<a href="2443.html#2464qlink3">&gt; to measure the mass of the offender it has been injected in, to dispense the</a><br>
<i>&gt; correct dosage of whatever it is using to immobilize that individual.</i><br>

<p>
Doesn't sound very practical, and isn't really necessary. One look at a
person wil tell you how far up the knob should go (and besides, how
often is one attacked by little old ladies, eh? -- not to mention that
anyone who attacks you out of the blue deserves whatever shock
he's getting). 
 
<p>
<a href="2443.html#2464qlink4">&gt; Promoting such technolgies, IMHO, once they get into the hands of criminals (as</a><br>
<i>&gt; they will, since they are non-lethal technologies, it should be easier for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; person to get ahold of them), will cause the rates of robberies and rapes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; skyrocket, since criminals will love these technologies. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="2523qlink1">That may be, but it is better to be zapped than to be stabbed/beaten/
shot, which is often the alternative.</a> And of course anyone with half
<a name="2523qlink2">a brain will carry his/her own piece (and the threshold for using the gun
for self-defense will be lower too).</a> In any case, if this weapon can
be made cheap and reliable enough, it will be the wave of the future.
Trying to surf that wave would be wise indeed.
