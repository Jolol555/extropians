<a name="0184qlink1">I also remember hearing that Dr. K stated that, if convicted and jailed, he
would fast until he died.  I wonder to what degree he was just getting old
and tired and wanted a showdown before he himself died.  This may be why he
chose to make the injection himself rather than allow the patient to pull
his own plug, and possibly why he chose to represent himself in court.   He
must have known that this would increase the probability of his conviction.
Maybe he intended to go to jail all along where his own suicide, the
ultimate expression of his belief in the right to die, would have a greater
chance of turning him into a martyr.
