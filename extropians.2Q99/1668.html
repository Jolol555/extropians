<i>&gt;endeavor that is as fast paced as slalom racing (or sword/lightsaber</i><br>

<i>&gt;precise amounts, constantly correcting from sensory feedback, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;absolutely cannot depend on (and must often totally ignore) what your</i><br>

<i>&gt;people call 'right brain' thinking, where you have developed such a</i><br>
<i>&gt;large body of experience in the movements that it becomes second</i><br>
<i>&gt;nature, where you can whip through a world cup slalom course while</i><br>

It fits in with the rest of the "philosophy" mentioned in the
movies. The goal of much of eastern mysticism (and the wisdom of Yoda
is borrowed from there, of course) is to achieve a state of freely
flowing action, where you don't have to consciously think in order to
act right. The way of reaching this is of course practice, practice,
practice.

<p>
The trick is to be good enough at what you are doing so that you don't
have to involve the messy prefrontal planning systems, and use them
for the new and uncertain situations instead.
