If someone actually advances a new argument, sure.  But that doesn't happen 
very often.

<p>
Let's look at the identity question, for example.  There are two 
well-defined positions on the issue, and a bunch of incoherent stages that 
people usually pass through on their way to one of these two end points. 
 When someone new brings up the topic, we want to tell them what the major 
positions are and explain the arguments for them.  We do *not* want to 
start a 1200-message flame war that simply rehashes all the arguments that 
we've already seen.  A bit of back-and-forth discussion is a good thing, 
but a long, drawn-out argument will just end up being a waste of bandwidth.

<p>
Of course, it would be easier to deal with this problem if we had more 
on-line resources to work with.  The Transhumanist FAQ is great for 
defining terms, but there are a lot of topics (identity and uploading, 
intelligence augmentation, freedom/individualism, etc.) that really need a 
longer treatment.
