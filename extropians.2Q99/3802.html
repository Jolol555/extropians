 Assuming none are hoping for a sexual encounter

<p>
IMHO:
<br>
You think this can happen without major brain damage as a factor? I think
not, especially from the male point of view. We see a woman, ANY woman, and
they are immediately and automatically evaluated. From then, if they are
attractive, we suck up to them, again automatically. If they're crap we
attempt to get away - there's nothing to be gained here...... In my
experience men rarely accept platonic female "friends", of course, because
the woman does, the man must give the impression that he thinks similarly,
to keep the woman at ease. But secretly, the man is in it for a shag, mark
my words.

<a name="3845qlink1">The relationship from man-man is much different, there is no alterior
motivation, just a task at hand such as bonding, entertainment, or doing a
job. Hence different communication tactics.</a>
