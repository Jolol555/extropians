Is the list healthy?

<a name="0261qlink1">I had forgotten how much stress is involved in reading the list.</a>  In the
last week and a half (since I started reading the list again) I have been
amazed at the level of acrimony.  This isn't the way people normally talk
to each other in everyday life, at least not where I live.  Maybe in Russia
or Yugoslavia...  Of course I'm not denying that I do it myself.  I like
<a name="0258qlink1">the adrenaline rush from a flame war as much as anybody.  (Meet me after
school, Billy, in the parking lot behind the gym</a> ;-)  But I wonder, what
effect do e-mail arguments have on our health?  In spite of our talk about
life extension, we may all die before our time, just from the stress.  

<p>
Unless we can break the habit.
