Some claim that it started early in the christian era and only modern pollution is
holding it off. The "Little Ice Age" is well documented in terms of its weather
patterns, but not the causes of its rise and fall.

Chatting with my cousin, the ice age geologist, he said the last interglacial
period was 36,000 years ago, which meant there was plenty of time then for a human
civilization to arise. Unfortunately there is little evidence from that far back
that has been preserved beyond bones. Of course, the areas where civilizations have
arisen in this interglacial period have actually not seen polar ice sheets for
millions, if not hundreds of millions of years, when those contenents were near or
on a polar cap.
