Yes, and this is a problem for us transhumanists because it occurs in
all sorts of settings, not just superhero comics but also movies,
books and serious discussions of the future. In order to make things
look ordinary they downplay or ignore the truly worldchanging stuff -
superheroes doesn't change the world as much as a semi-intelligent
secretary program would. This in turns means that many people who
otherwise would have been stimulated to think more about 'what if'
scenarios instead get the view that nothing really changes
reinforced. So we end up with people who have trouble extrapolating
well, opposing many transhumanist ideas for the wrong reasons (like
believing that life extension by necessity will affect only a few
individuals and not all of society etc). That ought to be changed.
