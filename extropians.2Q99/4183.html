<p>
I'm announcing publicly the action I'm taking on the gun moratorium.  I agree 
with Eliezer that this shouldn't be taken too seriously.  It is, after all, 
just an e-mail list.  However, I believe it is important to make clear the 
rationale for the action I'm taking. The following is based on posts made 
through June 15.

<p>
First, I've decided to extend an amnesty regarding all posts on the 
<br>
"High-tech weapons" and "G*n cam" threads.  Replies to the private emails I <br>
sent to some of the posters on these threads convinced me that the over-all 
approach to that subject was taken in good faith as not being within the 
ambit of the moratorium (i.e. beyond the subject of gun RIGHTS) and, in fact 
with only one exception, the posts appeared to be civil and to avoid the kind 
of pointless and personalistic squabbling that precipitated the current 
problem.  I did not contact every poster on these threads, because it was 
becoming clear as the last week progressed that it would be unfair to 
sanction posters who were carrying on a discussion they clearly believed in 
good faith was exempt from the moratorium.  I will note that I considered 
this thread to have been within the moratorium but, so long as posters 
continue to limit discussion to technological issues, will not consider it 
such hereafter.  However, any posts in that thread (or any other) that 
violate the general guidelines of the list calling for polite discourse will 
be subject to the normal sanctions of unsubscription upon receipt of a 
complaint.  In this regard, please remember that all list posters have the 
right to seek unsubscription of indivduals they believe have transgressed the 
bounds of civility.

<p>
Second, postings in the "Fear of Guns vs. Fear of No Guns" thread were clear 
violations of the temporary moratorium.  Checking my records, I find that I 
contacted each poster in that thread.  Tim Bates responded that he had not 
seen the moratorium announcement and made his case credible by not 
subsequently posting in that thread or other gun threads.  Accordingly, I'm 
taking no action against Tim.  The other posters in that thread either did 
not respond to my personal emails or did not plead ignorance.  Accordingly, a 
sanctioning action will be taken against EvMick@aol.com, ejruud@ucdavis.edu 
and joesdees@bellsouth.net.  I trust that no one will accuse me of 
partisanship in this matter, as EvMick is one of my favorite people on the 
list -- I really enjoy tracking his travels as the only transhuman trucker 
discovered to date.

<p>
Because the moratorium by and large had the effect of dampening the 
unpleasant and obsessively numerous postings in the guns thread, I am going 
to reduce the originally-announced sanction from a three-month to a one-month 
suspension.  If ExI is able to implement a moderated or otherwise 
better-structured list in the meantime, the sanctioned individuals will be 
invited to resubscribe at that time.  Otherwise, I will invite these posters 
to resubscribe one month hence.

<p>
Having announced this action, I feel obliged to ask that each member of this 
list community please take the personal responsibility to avoid the kind of 
nasty, personalistic or obsessive posting that precipitated this problem in 
the first place.  I personally believe that a discussion of gun rights is 
perfectly proper on this list.  However, undertaking a crusade that involves 
posting as many as dozens of messages per day, day after day, is just the 
kind of inflammatory tactic that can ruin an online community.  Personalistic 
slurs and foul language are clearly prohibited on this list and are subject 
to on-going rules calling for unsubscription of individuals who engage in 
this sort of verbal behavior. 

<p>
Letting someone you consider wrong or even evil have the last word is a lot 
less damaging to your cause than prolonging a pointless exercise in 
name-calling.  Please consider that drafting and posting a well-reasoned 
summation of your views is much more persuasive than engaging in a prolonged 
campaign of name-calling, no matter how eloquent or entertaining to you the 
name-calling may be.
