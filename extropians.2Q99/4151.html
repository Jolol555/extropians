I've come to a decision about enforcement of the temporary moratorium on 
discussion of gun rights.  This decision has been approved by Max More and 
will be implemented today.  Because I have to be away from the net during the 
day today and I don't want to publicly announce the result of this action 
until it has been implemented, look for a report on this action and a brief 
explanation of it this evening.

<p>
In the meantime before I hop on an airplane this morning, some 
meta-meta-comments:

I apologize for the use of a word, Harvey that is very much</a> in the idiom of 
<a name="4171qlink6">my personal and professional life.  Let me note that in fact what you and 
Jeff did was very much, however, in the spirit of private law enforcement 
that at least some extropians are quite interested</a> in.  The custom of private 
prosecution of criminal law was an old one in the English common law and 
continued in the US until into this century in some places.  Those who oppose 
an overly-powerful centralized state today have come to appreciate that 
private tort actions serve a similar function. (For instance, my own thinking 
about the positive value of private tort enforcement has evolved 
significantly over the last decade as I have become increasingly libertarian 
in my political philosophy.)

<p>
<a name="4171qlink7">As for having a "full-blown court drama", let me offer some brief 
observations about the process.  Libertarians (in the most general</a> sense of 
<a name="4171qlink8">the word) need to be flexible.  When you condemn authoritarianism, you 
necessarily have to embrace the fact that social systems should be able to 
respond flexibly to evolving facts.  As a result, due process becomes</a> a very 
<a name="4171qlink9">high value to libertarians.</a>  

<p>
Yes, this list "belongs" to ExI and it is therefore private property.  As 
officers of ExI, Max and I can basically do whatever we want with the list, I 
suppose.  But if we exercise this "authority" arbitrarily and unfairly, we 
will pay a price: People will freely choose to cease to associate themselves 
with ExI and the organization will suffer as its membership and influence 
dwindles.  Therefore, both Max and I place a high value on PROCESS: We try to 
get input from the people who are effected and others whose opinions we value 
before we take actions that effect the community that has gathered around 
extropian ideas and values.  In this regard, consider that it may be no 
coincidence that ExI has had lawyers involved in it from its inception.  

<p>
We didn't impose a temporary moratorium on discussion of gun rights lightly 
or thoughtlessly and, when it turned out that enforcing it required listening 
to what people had to say about it, we didn't reflexively act to unsubscribe 
every poster who had mentioned the word "guns" in a post.  Instead, as the 
person charged with managing this temporary problem, I ended up having to 
consider what the purpose of the temporary moratorium was, also consider the 
knowledge and intentions of the people who might be sanctioned under it, and 
finally consult with Max before taking action.  This has taken time during a 
week when I was much busier than I had anticipated I would be.

<p>
Finally, to put this all in context: This IS just an email list and we all 
have important work to do in our day-to-day lives (for many of us, work that 
actually involves moving the transhumanist agenda forward bit by bit -- pun 
intended).  If each poster will make an effort to be civil, annoying 
distractions like this won't be common and we can get on with our lives.
