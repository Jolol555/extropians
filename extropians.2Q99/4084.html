<p>
Extropes,

<p>
I've seen some other conference announcements posted here, so
I'll post this as well, in case this conference might appeal to some of
you astronomy enthusiasts. The astronomy subjects studied
in this conference are in our own solar system, after all ...

<p>
At the end of this message, I attach a press announcement
from Cornell.

Asteroids, Comets, and Meteors 1999

<p>
The Asteroid, Comets and Meteors Conference is held every three
years in different international locations, and this year it is
held in Ithaca, New York. The registration fee is $270 (guests
and students $135). One guest is allowed per person registering
under the standard fee.

<p>
P.S. I'll be giving a short talk that Friday morning and co-chairing
my session as well ("Asteroid &amp; Dust Dynamics").

             Asteroid, Comet And Meteor Conference Set For July

<p>
 The seventh International Conference on Asteroids, Comets and Meteors
 (ACM) will be held at Cornell University July 26-30. The conference is
 sponsored by NASA, the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins
 University, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Cornell.

<p>
 A broad range of scientific sessions will present the latest developments
 in all aspects of studies on asteroids, comets and meteors, including
 observations, theories of origin and evolution, discoveries and
 astrometry.

<p>
 Scientific sessions

<p>
 The 450 abstracts submitted have been organized into 28 different
 sessions, for approximately 18 hours of plenary talks and 18 hours of
 parallel sessions. In the past, the organization of the ACM scientific
 program has tended to split sessions along the asteroid, comet, meteor
 subcategories, resulting in a conference of three parallel topics with few
 opportunities for cross-disciplinary discussion.

<p>
 This year, an effort was made to organize the plenary sessions to be
 cross-disciplinary. Session titles will be broad, including such subjects
 as "Composition," "Spins and Sizes," "Collisional Processes" and
 "Transitional Objects."

<p>
 Sessions will include speakers from each of the asteroid, comet, and
 meteor categories. In addition, poster sessions will draw participation
 from all categories of ACM subjects.

<p>
 The ACM '99 conference's invited speakers are at the forefront of their
 fields and will be reporting on recent research in their areas of
 expertise. They were chosen because the recent advances in these areas are
 particularly exciting and newsworthy.

<p>
 Invited speakers and their topics will include:


<UL>
  <li>  Steven J. Ostro, JPL: Dramatic new asteroid results from the Arecibo
   Observatory.

  <li>  M.A. Barucci, Observatoire de Paris: Observations of objects at the edge
   of the solar system.

  <li>  Donald Brownlee, University of Washington: Stardust space mission.

  <li>  S.J. Bus, Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Findings on structure
   of asteroid families.

  <li>  W.J. Merline, Southwest Research Institute: Discovery of a satellite of
   asteroid Eugenia.

  <li>  Eberhard Gruen, Max Planck Institute: Confirmation of galactic dust near
   Earth.

 History of the ACM

<p>
 The first ACM conference was held in 1983 in Uppsala, Sweden. Follow-up
 meetings were held in Uppsala in 1985 and 1989; in Flagstaff, Ariz., in
 1991; in Belgirate, Italy, in 1993; and in Versailles, France, in 1996.
 The number of participants has grown steadily, from 76 in 1983 to about
 500 in 1996. Attendees are drawn from all over Europe, from Australia, New
 Zealand, North and South America, India, Central Asia and Japan.

<p>
 The spirit of the ACM conference has been to welcome scientists and
 enthusiasts of asteroid, comet and meteor studies of all ages and from all
 nations to a gathering where ideas can be openly shared and discussed. ACM
 '99 at Cornell will continue this tradition.
