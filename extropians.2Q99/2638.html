I'm not sure how they are complex.  I actually had no idea that such
networks even existed until I read about in some biology journal.  It
piqued my curiosity enough, to go out in the field and try to find some.  I
eventually found a small grouping of mushrooms in the forest near my
house.  When I gently pulled up one some of the mushrooms, I was surprised
to see a complex web of mycelia that extended in every direction.  The
first thing it reminded me of was a large cluster of interconnected
neuronic cells.

<p>
According to mycologists, the mycelia networks are the main 'body' of the
organism, and the actually mushroom head is only for sexual reproduction.

<p>
Yes, the idea of tapping into these mycelia like we would the internet
sounds intriguing.
