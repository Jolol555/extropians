    Scientists clone human embryos

    LONDON (June 16, 1999 9:43 p.m. EDT
<br>
    <a href="http://www.nandotimes.com">http://www.nandotimes.com</a>) - American scientists have cloned
    the first human embryos, the London Daily Mail
    reported on Thursday. 

<p>
    Using methods similar to those which produce Dolly
    the cloned sheep at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute,
    they produced a male embryo comprising nearly 400
    cells, according to the British tabloid. 

<p>
    The scientists at the Massachusetts-based
    Advanced Cell Technology then incinerated it after
    two days. 

<p>
    They want to produce human body tissue which can
    be used to treat patients with various conditions,
    including nerve damage, diabetes and Parkinson's
    disease. 

<p>
    A DNA-loaded nucleus of a human cell was
    extracted from a skin sample from a man's leg and
    then inserted into the outer protein of a hollowed
    out cow's egg under laboratory conditions, said the
    Mail. 

<p>
    The egg was then placed in a laboratory dish and
    soaked in a chemical solution which fooled it into
    thinking it was a newly conceived embryo. 

<p>
    The cells then began to develop into an embryo,
    according to the Daily Mail. 

<p>
    Since the first embryo was cloned last November,
    the company is thought to have made many more,
    incinerating them all, in line with U.S. research
    lines, before they reached the age of 14 days, said the
    newspaper.

<p>
Too bad they have to destroy them...
