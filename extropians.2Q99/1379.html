Well put. I recognize my own thinking in what you say.

<a href="1364.html#1379qlink1">&gt; Basically, I have more ideas than I could possibly use myself.  I think</a><br>
<i>&gt; of all kinds of inventions and business plans and fun activities,</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting problems, etc.  I just love coming up with this stuff, and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; can do it all day with little effort.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because I come up with so many ideas that I think others could benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt; from, I have decided it would be worthwhile to give them away in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; further my goal of living in a peaceful prosperous world. </i><br>

<p>
Exactly. This is the core of the information economy, and why it is so
different from traditional economics: we become wealthier the more we
give away. Unlike the traditional material economies where altruism by
necessity had a negative utility for oneself, here it can have zero or
a positive utility, making it more likely. 

<p>
<a href="1364.html#1379qlink2">&gt; To me, that is a good trade.  Currently, I want to develop more</a><br>
<i>&gt; outlets for sharing my ideas with others.  Eventually, I would like</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have a website where people could access my ideas and contribute</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own.</i><br>

<p>
A kind of ideas bank? I think there are some on the net already, but
the idea itself can likely be developed. 

<p>
<a href="1364.html#1379qlink3">&gt; If anyone could assist me in this endeavor, I would certainly appreciate</a><br>
<i>&gt; it.  Basically, I want to go public with my ideas so that I and many</i><br>
<i>&gt; others can cash in on the investment I have made in my own intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; throughout my life.</i><br>

<p>
I'm not sure I could contribute to setting up the website (too much to
do), but I sure would contribute some ideas and discussion.
