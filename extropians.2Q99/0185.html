My concern is not that people will voluntarily choose to forego these
services, but rather that they will not be able to obtain them.  You can
only buy what someone is willing to sell.</a>

<p>
Much of anarcho-capitalist theory rests on an implicit assumption that a
market for law will work much like other markets, in that ordinary market
forces will lead to companies offering whatever mix of services the public
actually wants.  I believe that what evidence we have, both historical and
<a name="0204qlink1">theoretical, does not support this theory.  Instead, I expect that whatever
private institutions are given the power to initiate the use of force will
use this power to short-circuit market feedback to their own benefit.</a>

<p>
Your proposal would address some of the problems with PPAs by ensuring that
they do not simply band together and set up some kind of oligarchy.  It did
not address the more subtle ways that PPAs can use force to gain competitive
advantages, or the other less obvious problems with such schemes.  These
problems are important, because they can easily lead to abuses just as bad
as the government atrocities we are trying to avoid.
