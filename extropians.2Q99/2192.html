<i>&gt; &gt; This may be a weak argument, but to me there seems to be little</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; extropian value in enslaving oneself to a gun.  Making a gun one's first</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; defense to any threat, imagined or otherwise,  is hardly developing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; yourself as a human.  Non-violence, while less spectacular and seemingly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; slower to get results, is (in my opinion) always to be preferred to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; violent approach.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Legal gun owners, demographically, have the lowest incidence of violent crime of</i><br>
<i>&gt; any demographic group. We set the standard of non-violence that the rest of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; so-called non-violent pacifistic culture can't seem to meet. You're statement</i><br>
<i>&gt; about 'enslaving oneself to a gun' is rather pathetic, since: a) you can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; enslave yourself to an inanimate object, b) if you could, IMHO that would be by</i><br>
<i>&gt; choice, and is far far better than becoming forcibly enslaved to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government/criminal terrocrat industry.</i><br>

<a href="2050.html#2192qlink2">&gt; A gun is a technological tool, like any other tool (i.e. a PC, a cell phone,</a><br>
<i>&gt; nanotech, brain implants, cryonic suspension, etc) is merely a means to greater</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom and ability for the individual, which is exactly what extropy is all</i><br>
<i>&gt; about. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
The obvious difference is, of course, that guns, alone of the above 
mentioned devices, supposedly extend one life by ending another.  
Perhaps you don't see it, but I think that's a pretty significant 
difference.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2050.html#2192qlink3">&gt;Government has no interest in giving you greater freedom, only in </a><br>
taking
<br>
<a href="2050.html#2192qlink4">&gt; it away. It has no interest in giving you greater ability, as that is a threat</a><br>
<i>&gt; to its own power. Un-extropic individuals hate us and the things we stand for.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They will not stop at mere legal maneuvers to prevent us from acheiving our</i><br>
<i>&gt; goals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I want your ass uploaded YESTERDAY, to get you away from the 
guns you would just LOVE to get a chance to use on people, 
Rambo!  BTW, you anthromorphize government too much.  It is not 
this self-aware monster you would demonize it to be, and has no 
self-reflective will of its own.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2050.html#2192qlink5">&gt; Longevity is another extropian value. Non-gun-owners have a higher mortality</a><br>
<i>&gt; rate than gun owners.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Because they're shot down by gun owners who SHOULDN'T HAVE 
THEM!
