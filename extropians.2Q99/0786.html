To an economist, this is still awkwardly asked.  If they wished to retire 
badly enough, they would, and just live poorly.   But retirement is not 
directly what people want.  They want to consume stuff, and to avoid boring 
work, just as they always have.  If we took today's life cycle and expanded 
it by a factor of five, from 60 years to 300 years, and personal discount 
rates and interest rates fell by a factor of five, then you would expect 
the same life cycle behavior, spread out over a longer time.  People would 
work till ~300 then retire.

<p>
The question is what, if anything, would break this scaling hypothesis. 
Wealth probably doesn't much.  We still work most of our lives, even though 
we are vastly richer than our ancestors.  Personal discount rates might 
well not scale though.  Evolution seems to have hard coded in us a discount 
rate of a factor of two per historic generation time of ~25 years. This 
suggests interest rates won't fall below ~3%, unless our subjective sense 
of time is changed somehow.  This is what suggest earlier retirement. 

<p>
Over 200 years, the economy could change a lot.  But assuming we don't run 
out of technological progress, then there should continue to be lots of 
profitable investment projects.

<p>
With rapid population growth as now, the 100+ year old folks would be a 
small fraction of the population, so folks could retire at 100, and live 
off savings for the next 200 years, without distorting the economy much. If 
most of the population were retired, however, we get the problem of what 
exactly did their savings buy to let them consume so much.  Most income 
(~70%) is now from labor, so unless we get AI, or the economy changes 
drastically to more favor other forms of capital, then the old folks need 
to "own" lots of labor income of younger folks to make this work.  Absent 
slavery, you'd need young folks paying off debt from loans used to develop 
their human capital, or some such.

<p>
As usual, the right thing to do here it make one's assumptions explicit,
put them in a simple economic model, and see what happens that way.
