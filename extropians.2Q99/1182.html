So do modern archaeologists.  They have even reconstructed the exact methods
used by architects of different cultures, and they often use these
comparisons as a means of measuring cultural influence between different
regions.

<p>
The only reason it sounds hard is that you're trying to construct a perfect
simulation of the problem - something that was not even remotely conceivable
to the ancients.  The Greeks (and other ancient cultures) developed
arch-building techniques purely by trial-and-error, and they had no idea</a> why
things had to be done the way they were.  You can easily duplicate this
process just by studying an existing arch and copying it.
