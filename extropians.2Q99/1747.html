</a>WHAT'S HUSHMAIL?

<p>
Speak freely with Hushmail!

<p>
Much more than webmail! Much more than SSL! HushMail uses java applet
technology to bring a full-featured public-key cryptosystem right into your
browser. What does that mean to you? Total privacy! Absolutely no-one but
you can read your messages!</a>

<p>
HushMail is the world's ﬁrst, fully encrypted, truly secure, free web-based
e-mail client. Our patent pending, state-of-the-art technology keeps
private communication private. Free and easy to use, It works just like
other web-based email providers, except Hushmail offers the ultimate in
security and privacy.

<p>
Signing on is simple. Just click on "GET AN ACCOUNT" and you'll be asked
for your username and some basic demographic information. Jiggle your mouse
to generate a random set of keys and you're ready to go. It's that simple.
Hushmail requires no special software or conﬁguration. The whole
registration process can take less than 2 minutes.

<p>
And with Hushmail you get the following beneﬁts:

<p>
It's completely free.

<p>
It's easy to use.

<p>
And it's the only service that offers fully encrypted, truly secure,
completely private e-mail.

<p>
HushMail uses a patent-pending process called "public key cryptosystem with
roaming user capability." That means that the only people who can read your
mail are the people that you send<a name="1813qlink1"> it to. And it also mean that you can
access your account from any computer that has a web browser and internet
access, anywhere in the world.</a>

<p>
It's your choice.

<p>
Before Hushmail, you didn't have an easy option for complete security and
privacy in your web-based email communications. It just didn't exist. The
ineffective encryption measures used by other email service providers just
don't measure up to the patent pending, state-of-the-art security provided
by Hushmail. And our easy-to-use interface means that you don't have to
change the way you are used to using email.

<p>
So now that you have a choice between secure and private communications or
unsecured communications, we hope you'll choose security and privacy. In
short, we hope you choose Hushmail.
