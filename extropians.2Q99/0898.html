I have to second some of what Eliezer said.
Putting my own spin on the characterological adjective situation here:
"Undifferentiated" may very well be a feature, not a bug; people who don't
label themselves strongly (self-scoring) may just be Myers-Briggs Ps rather
than Js (to name one possibility).
<br>
Guessing from his described actions, I'd rate Eliezer as a 0-0. :)

<i>&gt;there is no directionality in your scores, the survey says so and concludes</i><br>
<i>&gt;that you are Androgynous.  This is only true, however, if your scores are</i><br>
<i>&gt;both above the mid-point since this means that you are endorsing attributes</i><br>

<i>&gt;close to 4, you would actually be classified as Undifferentiated, since you</i><br>
<i>&gt;aren't really endorsing attributes from either gender.  Curt Adams, for</i><br>

<i>&gt;I classified him as Masc.</i><br>

<i>&gt;Summary Statistics</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0895.html#0898qlink2">&gt;Mean    4.14  5.11  Masc</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Undifferentiated  11.0%</i><br>
<i>&gt;Masculine            55.5%</i><br>
<i>&gt;Feminine               5.5%</i><br>
<i>&gt;Androgynous      28.0%</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So, Extropians appear to be strongly disposed toward traditionally masculine</i><br>
<i>&gt;attributes, although a significant number are Androgynous.  I can't find it</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the archives, but didn't the Myers-Briggs test we took earlier reveal</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the largest group was ENTJ?  It's very likely that there's a strong</i><br>
<i>&gt;relationship between these two measures.</i><br>
