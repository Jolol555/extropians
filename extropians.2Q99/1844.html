<p>
<a href="1840.html#1844qlink2">&gt; If you exclude crimes which are lesser or are not offenses in other countries we'd</a><br>
have a far more comparative level of imprisonment. Additionally China has a higher
fraction in prison, if you include 're-education camps' as prisons. I find it
interesting that the three most powerful nations have the highest prison
populations....
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="1840.html#1844qlink3">&gt; On the other hand, since most crime here is commited by criminals on other</a><br>
criminals, I can't say that you could call all of our prisoners 'oppressed'. 

<p>
And what about the war on drugs, which in a rational world would
duly be classified as a crime against humanity?<a name="1847qlink2"> Apart from that, your 
prison system (and in fact just about all the prison systems of the 
</a>
so-called "civilized" nations) are simply barbaric. Little better than 
concentration camps, really.</a>

<p>
&gt;&gt;As far as I know the only throught crimes here in the US are pornographic
pedophilia, telling the President what you really think of him, looking at female
co-workers the wrong way, and disliking the publicly protected ethnic groups.&lt;&lt;

<p>
And that's another problem. But forget thought crimes, facing jail for 
possession of some MJ is oppression enough, IMHO.
