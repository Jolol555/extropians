Harvey I was a vegetarian for 4 critical years, ages 14 to 18,  vegan for 2 of
those (religious reasons).  Turns out that my brother and all my male cousins
are way taller than me and all have back problems from growing so fast
and so far.  By my taking up a low fat diet during the growth years, I spared
myself scoliosis by stunting my growth half an inch short of 6 ft.
I have one cousin that is 6 ft 10 inches.  I did not know that I could have
gotten back problems otherwise, I did not know that low fat diets could
make one grow less.  Just lucked out.  spike
