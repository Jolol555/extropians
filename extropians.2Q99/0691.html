of the beam output?</a></a></a>

<a name="0698qlink2"><a name="0693qlink2">Do photons from a laser upon impact of a reflective surface cause an
inertial reaction, no matter how infinitesimal?</a></a>

<p>
<a name="0698qlink3"><a name="0693qlink3">If lasers have no "kick" upon firing, and photons from a coherent laser
do cause an inertial reaction, then lasers could be used as reactionless
propulsion.</a></a>

<p>
It would be interesting to note simple reactionless propulsion from
mirrors.  "How is it done?  Mirrors."

<p>
My initial design ideas would be a ring of lasers around a hole in a
sphere pointing towards a parabolic mirror on the other side.  The
engine could be mounted on a gimbal or gyrodyne setup for directional
reactionless propulsion.

<p>
<a name="0693qlink4">As a craft propelled by such moved along, it's trail would be a beam of
coherent light flying at the speed of light away from the engine.</a>

<p>
If the force from firing a laser and its reaction upon impact cancel,
then this would not work.  If it does work, it is copyrighted by me.

<p>
Fifth- or higher dimensional travel would still be preferable as it
would eliminate any concerns of distance.

<p>
Have a nice day,
