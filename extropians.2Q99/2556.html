Besides being a liar (on another point), you are also a humorless 
moron who could not recognize the canine jaws of sarcasm if they 
bit you in the gluteus maximus.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<a href="2535.html#2556qlink2">&gt; counts as a felony, what counts as abuse, and what counts as madness?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
The appropriate authorities, of course (which you, being one of 
those outlaws who have guns, refuse to accept).  Note that I am 
not saying that you're an outlaw because you have a gun (if indeed 
you do); merelt yhat your refusal to accept legitimate legal 
authority brands you as one.
<br>

<a href="2535.html#2556qlink3">&gt; There are two stable situations with weapon ownership: either anyone can</a><br>
<i>&gt; own and carry anything they like (the traditional American ideal), or we're </i><br>
<i>&gt; all locked away in padded cells under continual surveillance for our own </i><br>
<i>&gt; safety (the British ideal). Any attempt to create an intermediate state </i><br>
<i>&gt; will fail, with society heading towards one of the extremes; this is why</i><br>
<i>&gt; we can't have a 'reasonable compromise' on this issue.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
You sound exactly like the antiabortion extremists.  There is a vast 
middle ground, and the fact that you deny its existence and 
demand to cast everything in absolutistic dualist terms reveals 
nothing about future societal options and everything about your own 
cognitive limitations.
