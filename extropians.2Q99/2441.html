<i>&gt; &gt; From:                   "Michael S. Lorrey" &lt;mike@lorrey.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; In 1968, Senator Thomas Dodd (father of current Senator Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.)) was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the chairman of the Subcommittee on Juvinile Delinquency, a subcommittee of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Judiciary Committee. Senator Dodd had been a prosecutor at Nuremburg after the war, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; although it was not a part of any of the cases he handled, he somehow got a copy of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Nazi Weapons Law. In 1968 he gave this to a translator at the Legislative Research</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Service to translate into english. It has been conclusively shown</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Who showed this?  The NRA?  "Silent Scream" propaganda</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; transmuted to the gun cause?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, it was researched by the Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership. I have copies</i><br>
<i>&gt; of all of the public records that document the communications between Senator Dodd and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Legislative Research Service before and during the senate committee hearings on the GCA</i><br>
<i>&gt; proposals, as well as translations of the original Reichsgeletsblatt Waffengelets. They are</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the public record for anyone to access. If you don't take my word for it, do the research</i><br>
<i>&gt; yourself.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I've heard of that group.  Their membership is miniscule, their 
politics are extreme rather than mainstream, and they most clossly 
resemble that tiny antiabortion group African Americans against 
Genocide which loudly trumpets, in the face of all evidence that 
even statistically more whites abort than blacks, that legal abortion 
is a white plot to exterminate black babies.
<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; that the Gun Control</i><br>
<a href="2425.html#2441qlink2">&gt; &gt; &gt; Act of 1968, that Senator Dodd's committee submitted to the Senate, was an accurate</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; translation of the Nazi Weapons Law, as adapted for our different legal system, and was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; only missing the requirements for a national gun owner registration system and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; national concealed weapons permit system. It was from the Nazi law that the concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; 'sporting purpose' was borrowed (and is now one of the mantras of Handgun Control Inc</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; to condemn effective self defense weapons). For 30 years now we have been living under</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Nazi laws in this country.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; So Joe Dees, how does it feel to be in the company of the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; You are, you know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Such epithets are thrown at every prochoice person in America; it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reveals more about the mindset of such accusers (who may indeed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; use the spectre of Nazi Germany or slavery to justify right-wing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; violence in America) that it does about those whom they attack.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; BTW, I see no mention of gender or nationality in the laws that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have advocated for the US.  I do know, however, that a lot of gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nuts, racists, sexists and antisemites run in the same packs - and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they just ADORE reichean history, don't they, Herr Mike?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That label is used by the controllers against freedom lovers, but it is the controllers, esp.</i><br>
<i>&gt; the DemoKratiK Nazionale Kommittee, that advocates a NAtionalized, soZIialized country. Keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; in mind that it was the liberals, the democrats, who were FOR slavery. Equating</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarianism with naziism is an example of how far you have flipped your lid. Even on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cartesian political, libertarians and nazis are in diametrically opposite corners.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Yeah, but times change things, and now it is the republicans who 
try to tap racist sentiments with flag phrases, and the libertarians 
ally themselves with that self-serving devil damned closely.
