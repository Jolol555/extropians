<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; A straitjacket might work for the Black Belt... :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; We've come full circle - now I am back where I started, with the opinion</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; that the Second Amendment means what it says.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; We need to control VIOLENCE, not weapons. If HCI spent 10% of the money</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; they are getting from that Cheryl Wheeler anti-gun song that's playing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; around, maybe someone could research the real causes and recommend some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; real actions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I have recommended some real actions which, if taken, would help</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to alleviate the very real problem.  One of the best ways to control</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; violence is to keep weapons out of the hands of people who have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; been reasonably identified, based upon their history, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; predisposed to violence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And I have said that they are not totally unreasonable, but only as I interpret them</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be, if I get to decide who fits your definitions. The problem with these sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; restrictions is that as other governments have demonstrated in the past, such</i><br>
<i>&gt; restrictions can be redefined by any legislature, or tyrant, or judicial activist,</i><br>
<i>&gt; to mean whatever they want them to mean, which IMHO is the best reason not to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; such restrictions in the first place. I personally would rather live with the low</i><br>
<i>&gt; risk of possible criminal activity against me that I know I can defend against, than</i><br>
<i>&gt; to live under a system where there is absolutely no protection against a tyrannical</i><br>
<i>&gt; government enslaving some or all and committing genocide against the evil minority</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the day.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
In a democracy, as I have previously stated, we can enforce our 
definitions by choosing the definers with our popular vote, so your 
tactic of arguing against an A to which you cannot rationally object 
directly by raising the slippery-slope straw man spectre of an 
unacceptable B must fail on that account.  It is a more productive 
political tactic to ensure that the mainstream position is reasonable 
than to isolate yourselfl on the extreme and subsequently lose all 
influence from there.
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2630.html#2698qlink2">&gt; Joe, you always seem to be big on security. Please show me where in either the</a><br>
<i>&gt; Constitution or the Declaration of Independence that says that there is some</i><br>
<i>&gt; inalienable right to security? Freedom is decidedly NOT security, and our country is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not meant to give anybody security. We can drag out the famous Ben Franklin quote</i><br>
<i>&gt; about freedom versus security if you want, to show the founders intent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
You place absolute value on freedom and none on security, rather 
than finding the empirical blend which gives us the greatest 
practically achieveable combination of both?  Such a position is 
irrationally absolutist and extremist on its face. 
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2630.html#2698qlink3">&gt; I don't want ANY security from the government, I am quite capabile of providing my</a><br>
<i>&gt; own. Government too often views any security power as the power to protect you from</i><br>
<i>&gt; yourself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Well, I view selectively keeping firearms out of the hands of violent 
criminals, kids and the certifiably insane to be in my best security 
interest, and that is the position I am prepared to lobby for, and I 
am equally prepared to lobby against anything that would prevent 
the rest of us from possessing and purchasing firearms.  Your 
security is nil when an armed nut has your back.
