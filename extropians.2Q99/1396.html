Designer Molecules: Largest Protein Ever Created From Scratch Has 
Implications For Novel Drug Delivery And Diagnostics
For the last decade, scientists have been trying to accurately synthesize 
substances with shapes that mimic biological molecules, specifically 
proteins that drive important biochemical pathways in humans. So far, these 
attempts have made moderate strides, both in terms of size of the designed 
protein and the precision with which it folds from a string of amino acids 
to its final three-dimensional structure. Now, researchers at the University 
of Pennsylvania Medical Center have created the largest protein from 
scratch, with both a stable and predictable shape.
<br>
"The ability to do this really takes us out of the realm of tinkering with <br>
existing proteins to engineering entirely new proteins and polymers," says 
senior author William F. DeGrado, Ph.D., professor of biochemistry and 
biophysics. "We have shown that it is now possible to design a protein with 
a well-defined three-dimensional structure." The Penn group's findings 
appear in the May 11 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences.

<p>
DeGrado notes that implications of this advance in protein design could be 
as broad as those for natural proteins -- from manufacturing entirely new 
polymers for industrial catalysts to creating new pharmaceuticals.

<p>
To design a protein, scientists generally work backwards from nature in a 
two-step process. They first choose an existing three-dimensional protein 
structure and then, using complex computer programs, find a new sequence of 
amino acids that folds into the same shape as the natural protein. The Penn 
team's approach is one step removed from that. "We asked: Can we generate 
proteins that are inspired by nature but have no direct natural 
equivalent?," explains DeGrado.

<p>
The protein -- called alpha-3D -- was designed, produced, and characterized 
by Scott Walsh, a doctoral student in DeGrado's lab. Alpha-3D is a bundle of 
three counterclockwise-coiling helices whose general shape was inspired by a 
protein found in the common household bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. 
Alpha-3D is also three times larger than previously synthesized proteins.

<p>
"By designing larger proteins, we can make them more stable and thus easier <br>
to manipulate," says Walsh. The next step will be to build a specific 
function into the protein's structure. Currently, Walsh is retooling the 
surface of alpha-3D to cause it to bind to a variety of hormonal receptors. 
Natural proteins that do this are expensive to produce and suffer from 
limited shelf lives. Novel mimics of these proteins may have enhanced 
stability and potency.

<p>
This work was conducted in the Johnson Research Foundation, a funding and 
research organization within Penn's Department of Biochemistry and 
Biophysics that concentrates on the study of physics as it applies to 
medicine.
