<p>
Yes, this is bound to be complicated and unpredictable. Although it is
not obvious how much an alien biochemistry will be allergenic or
toxic.  And then of course there are the common effects of strange
chemicals on our digestive system - eating local stuff is likely ill
advised.  My guess is that the biggest problem will be accidental
toxicity, as common substances in the biosphere might be similar to
important chemicals in our bodies. For example, in my current sf game
there is a disease where an otherwise fairly benign microorganism
produces an adrenaline-analogue when it colonizes the lungs.

<p>
Of course, the best solution here is to adapt to local
biochemistry. Why not get a body suited to the local environment and
fauna?
