Not one, but many, can overthrow a government through popular revolt, at least in this
country.  It seems to have not been done.

<p>
We might consider reorganizing government to some extent.  While many good laws are on
the books, their unenforcement makes them void.

<p>
There is so much bulk and triviata in the law books that almost any legal thing can be
interpreted in any of a number of ways.  There exists contradictory laws.

<p>
Here's what makes Washington run:  lobbyists.  This means money.  I'm not saying that
money-archy is not the way the world works.  Money-archy is not democratic, where each
individual has one vote.

<p>
A term to describe "money-archy"  might be econarchy, or econoarchy, using conventional
Greek etymology.  Essentially that is Darwinism.  The term is plutarchy.

<p>
The operations of our government are in many ways Constitutional.  In other ways, they
are not.

The United States of America was founded on the nature of individualism and personal
liberties, a very libertarian and at that time revolutionary ideal.  That was more than
200 years ago.  It's time for some reinforcement.

<p>
Exercising one's right to vote is a citizen-like thing to do.  Our elected
repesentatives are not necessarily the best or most capable decisionmakers, but
hopefully they are good ones, and they have access to many informational resources,
viz, the Library of Congress.

<p>
America does function from day to day as an economic democracy, and a shining light on
the planet.  Since democracy's inception with the Constitution of Cleisthenes or so,
humanity has moved forward ethically, but not continuously.
