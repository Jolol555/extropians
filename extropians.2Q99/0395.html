This does not seem to be a very good definition. What does "you are 
certain to find event B" mean? Does it mean "you are convinced that 
you will find event B"? Then your definition would make causal 
connections dependent on what you happen to think. Or does it just 
mean "Event B happens"? Then the sun's rising would be caused by the 
Big Ben striking 2 am, for whenever Big Ben strikes 2 am the sun will 
soon be rising (and sometimes the sun rises without Big Ben striking 
2 am, e.g. when BB is broken or before it was built, so condition 2 
is also satisfied).

Causation is a huge topic in contemporary analytic philosophy. Good 
old David Hume had a theory of causation that looks a little 
like what you might have been aiming for. According to Hume, event A 
causes event B if and only if:

<pre>
(1) A is prior (in time) to B.
(2) Whenever event A occurs, B occurs.
(3) A and B are contiguous (in space and time).

</pre>
<p>
(You could extend this by saying that A is an indirect cause of B iff 
they are connected by causal chain of events. E.g. A caused E, E 
caused F, F caused G, and G caused B.)

<p>
There are several well-known problems with Hume's theory which modern 
theories try to overcome.
