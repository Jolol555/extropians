<a href="4545.html#4629qlink1">&gt; &gt; O'Regan, Emlyn noted:  Actually they are all intelligent ... and cool</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sounding. It's set up like horoscopes, to stroke your ego. No one is</i><br>
<i>&gt; going</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to create a test that comes out as follows:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The Dispossessed - In space, no one can here you fail...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; haaaaa!  Thanks Emlyn, this was a hoot.  {8^D   I plan to do this</i><br>
<i>&gt; backwards:</i><br>
<i>&gt; read all the flattering possible outcomes, decide which one is most me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; *then* do the test, see if it comes out the way I thought...  {8-]  spike</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Has anyone tried inverting these tests? Answer all questions in exactly the
opposite manner to what you would answer, and see what comes out. Maybe we
can find out what the profile of a not-extropian is.

<p>
Anti-Emlyn's test results:

<p>
Your distinct personality, The Doctor might be found in most of the thriving
kingdoms of the time. Your emotions and feelings are reality based. You are
not misled with half formed ideas nor are you given to radical or high risk
experimentation. You follow the tried and true and do not waste time
thinking about things that cannot be seen, touched, heard, felt or smelled.
On the positive side, you can become an exceptional expert in your
particular area of the helping professions. You can deliver and maintain
consistent and beneficial service to others. You do not lose sight of the
reality of the situation and can usually control your own emotions. On the
negative side, your emotions must be sensually satisfied which could lead to
self-abusive behavior with food, drink, other substances and/or sex.
Interestingly, your preference is just as applicable in today's corporate
kingdoms.

Emlyn, no, no, the Dispossessed is not me, really!
