<p>
So where exactly does the Second Amendment say 'the right to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed except for mentally disturbed, children, felons
and abusives spouses'? I don't see it there, I can only assume you have a
different version of the Constitution to me. The states can probably pass
such laws, but any Federal disarmament laws are utterly unconstitutional.</a>

<p>
Victim disarmament is neither rational nor reasonable, and almost every 
country which has imposed registration of guns (and background checks are
registration by default) has gone on to ban and confiscate many or most 
of those registered guns. Most gun owners are reasonable people, and have
been willing to accept 'reasonable' infringements on their rights... and
you know what? The disarmers continually come back with just one more
'reasonable' infringement to add to the list until all rights are gone;
their desire to completely ban private ownership of guns is hardly a
secret. This will only stop when gun owners stand up and stop being
'reasonable'.</a>

Ok Joe, since you're the Constitutional expert, you explain just what
'general welfare' means in the context it's used in the Constitution.
