I was a Mormon for most of my teenage years.  I left the church at age 16, 
when I started studying other religions (past and present) and realized I 
couldn't find any reason to choose one creed over the others.  It took me a 
couple more years of inquiry to really make up my mind about theology and 
religion, at which point I embraced the rational view of reality.  It was a 
much slower process than such things usually are for me, but at least I 
managed to avoid the 'bitter atheist' syndrome I've seen so often.
