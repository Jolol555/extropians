You've never actually tried to sell the idea of
Elisson on this list (you've defended it but
that's another thing entirely).  I can understand
the appeal of a general framework for
<br>
self-propagating code but for what reason would I
want to invest money in your project?  I for one
would like to hear the 'spin' on the Elisson
Project.
