Oh brother.

Once again, this instrument has been used by respected academicians in
hundreds of studies that have appeared in scores of peer-reviewed journals.
Apparently, your insight never occured to them.

<p>
The author of this instrument was fully aware that the descriptors were
stereotypes.  The explicit purpose of the instrument was to assess the
degree to which an individual endorses attributes _traditionally_ associated
with males or _traditionally_ associated with females.  Self-Reliance is
_traditionally_ considered to be a masculine trait.   But there's no value
judgment offered here.<a name="0923qlink2">  No one is saying that's how it should be, and only
you appear outraged.
