<a href="2011.html#2023qlink1">&gt; &gt; To support my point I state this:  The guy I was just referring to who</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stated he would rather kill a police officer (who most likely has a wife</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and family) or other law enforcement officers than have his gun taken</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; away SHOULD have his license revoked for saying that and have his</i><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt; &gt; weapons taken away as he is talking like a potential killer and is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; clearly a threat to the general public from my perspective.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First they argue that they only want to take guns from criminals and</i><br>
<i>&gt; dangerous psychotics, now you recommend removing rights for thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; crimes and /potential/ criminals?  Do you honestly believe that your</i><br>
<i>&gt; broad knowledge of psychology and extensive interview with this man</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualifies you to make the judgment that he is unfit to exercise the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same rights you and I have?  In my judgment, he merely said that he</i><br>
<i>&gt; was willing to use those rights for precisely their intended purpose,</i><br>
<i>&gt; i.e., to defend himself from those (such as the police) who invade</i><br>
<i>&gt; his home with the intent to forcefully deprive him of his rights and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the means to exercise them.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2098qlink1"><a name="2035qlink1">He announced his willingness, even his eagerness, to shoot people 
in order to protect his right to possess the very gun with which he 
would be shooting these people.  I tend to believe people like that; I 
</a>
also tend to believe that they are paranoid, defensive, and overly 
</a>
agressive.  All he has to do is mistake someone's intentions 
ONCE, and he'll shoot them dead; he also would seem to be 
exactly the sort of trigger-happy boomjunkie who would be likely to 
make such a mistake first, and ask his lawyer to take questions 
later.  The other person's life would not enjoy the benefit of the 
doubt with him.  You can have him as a neighbor; I don't want him 
around me.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2011.html#2023qlink2">&gt;I'd have no problem at all with having</a><br>
<i>&gt; this man as a neighbor or business associate; he speaks his mind and</i><br>
<i>&gt; is willing to stand up for what's right.  And I have nothing to fear</i><br>
<i>&gt; from him because I have no desire to interfere with his choices.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't buy a used bike for $10 from Sarah Brady or her followers--</i><br>
<i>&gt; they've shown that they clearly lack the personal integrity to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; trusted with anything, least of all my life and liberty.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Peace is not a goal that can be worked toward; justice is the goal,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and peace is the natural consequence of justice.</i><br>
