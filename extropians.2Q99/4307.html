How about this:

<p>
Take a working (conscious) brain. Replace each connection between neuron X
and neuron Y with a pair of humans sending e-mail or talking on a phone or
whatever. The neurons are still alive. They produce signals, which are read
by a human (via some piece of equipment), sent to a receiving human, who
then stimulates the appropriate input of the receiving neuron.

<p>
The brain is still functioning (albeit with a time lag). The neurons are
doing the information processing, they are communicating the same
information to each other that they otherwise would. But they could be
seperated, kept alive in little dishes, as in the previous scenarios.

<p>
I agree that the brain as a whole organ/organism is not alive, although its
components are. But in exactly what way would this not qualify as conscious,
if the original brain does qualify?

<i>&gt; If there is a consciousness, it is contained by all the living humans who</i><br>

<i>&gt; that</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes this disembodied brain meet any definition of consciousness?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with the apparent aim of these "thought experiments", that is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; lead a person to realize that consciousness can be contained in non-human</i><br>
<i>&gt; brains.  I disagree with the specific example that claims the dissected</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain is still alive and functional because every separate neuron remains</i><br>
<i>&gt; intact.  As a psychology minor and a biology minor, I am adamant that this</i><br>
