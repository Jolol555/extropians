<a href="1488.html#1500qlink1">&gt; In that paper, http://xxx.lanl.gov/html/physics/9810010, the authors</a><br>
<i>&gt; emphasized the one aspect in which CAs are entirely compatible with</i><br>
<i>&gt; relativity, which is that they are inherently local.  The authors then</i><br>
<i>&gt; claimed to have a way to show that the speed of light would be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same in all moving frames in their CA model, but I think they were just</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking through their hats.  (I'm surprised that a paper like this was</i><br>
<i>&gt; published in what I have found in the past to be a very reliable forum,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the LANL physics archive.)</i><br>

<p>
Unfortunately the archive is not peer-reviewed, so anybody can send in
stuff. I guess few real crackpots try to post to gr-qc eller hp-th,
but the physics subsection has shown a slow increase in the number of
unorthodox articles of varying quality. 
 
<p>
<a href="1488.html#1500qlink2">&gt; It does seem that the separation of space and time is inherent to the CA</a><br>
<i>&gt; model.  You could set up a four-dimensional CA array which might represent</i><br>
<i>&gt; spacetime in some sense, but then what would it mean for the CA to evolve?</i><br>
<i>&gt; You've already incorporated what we call "time" in the four dimensional</i><br>
<i>&gt; CA.  It just doesn't fit.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1516qlink1">You could have a 4D CA representing the whole of spacetime, and then the
evolution rule would correspond to a gradual refinement/convergence to
a stable state which corresponds to the entire history of the
</a>universe.
