I wonder if Mr. Yudkowsky, after having seen "The Matrix",
will consider changing the name of his proposed seed-AI from
"Elisson" to "Eleison"!  ("Elisson", while very pretty, to the
extent that it suggests "Eli's Son" sounds like a fantasy straight
out of the pages of Thomas J. Ryan's _The Adolescence of P-1_).

<p>
Anyway, I wish him the best of luck with his proposed Singularitarians
mailing list -- perhaps it will attract interest and money from
Silicon Valley tycoons who turn up their noses at the Extropians'
list.

<p>
However, I too would be interested in a read-only archive of the
cream of the Singularitarians' list (purged of whatever is 
considered too sensitive for the eyes of non-members, of course!).
Since I am one of the wankers whom it will be the intention of
this list to filter out (having neither extraordinary money or
talent), I will get to view this material, if at all, only from
the outside, as a consumer.
