<p>
I saw _eXistenZ_ last weekend; I thought it was well worth seeing,
though quite different from _The Matrix_.  It wasn't stylish at
all, at least in the slick style of _The Matrix_; it looked distinctly
low-budget by comparison.  On the other hand, I got the idea that
the low budget look was part of the "point" of the movie (substitution
of drab VR scenarios, with shallow characters, hackneyed plot-lines,
and circumscribed possibilities, for the real thing).  As you might
gather, it casts a rather jaundiced eye at the possibility of "total"
VR.

<p>
Much of the film had a squishy, slightly gory character</a> in keeping
with some of Cronenberg's earlier films (_Videodrome_, _The Brood_);
the game consoles are fleshy, vaguely sexual-looking appliances
that gurgle and squeak, and have breast-like extrusions that have
to be squeezed, and nipples that have to be stroked, to operate them.
They're connected to their human operators with a cable that looks
a lot more like an umbilical cord than a wire, and is plugged into an
opening in the spine called a "bioport", which looks like (in closeup),
and in some scenes is treated as, an additional body orifice in a
quasi-sexual
<br>
sense.

<p>
I thought it was a hoot -- by all means, see it.
