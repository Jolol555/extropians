there, but as far as I remember Merced was supposed to be out already, and 
even their new core logic chips seem to be well behind (e.g. see
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/990608-000022.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/990608-000022.html</a>). Of course there's no 
particular technical reason for the new chips, so maybe they can drop them 
and push the 80x86 up to multi-gigahertz clock rates.

<p>
I agree, and I think we'll see a reversal of Intel's attempts to do 
everything on the CPU (e.g. soft modems) and more offloading of nonessential
functions to dedicated chips.
