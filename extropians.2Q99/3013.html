I have always said at Mensa gatherings that "I.Q. measures the size of your
gastank.  It doesn't say if you are running on empty!"  This was being
quoted in usenet taglines for a few years.

<p>
I think maximum potential is determined by genetics, but most people don't
get anywhere near their potential.  I think the physical body is another
good example.  Genetics may determine a person's build, but exercise and
diet will play a much larger role in the person's physical capabilities.
