There are a whole bunch of issues of this same form: We observe some
subsystem of ours that seems to have some counter-productive feature,
and we wonder how we're going to get rid of that feature while keeping 
all the positive features of that system.  

<p>
The first priority in such cases I think is to indentify the evolutionary
function of that "bad" feature.  One should be *very* cautious in 
redesigning any system where one doesn't understand the functional 
rationale of the original design features.  

<p>
Regarding the placebo effect, my theory is that we evolved to rationally
reduced our stress levels given the appearance of care by our allies.
Such appearance indicated that they would remain our allies, and with 
more allies we were likely to suffer fewer crisis events, and so
needed less of a stress-response.  Reduced stress-response meant our
bodies invested more in long term health.  Today, our bodies still
react to the appearance of care by reducing stress.

<p>
At a general level, this still seems a reasonable functional approach. 
Many details may be off now, however, such as how much care now
indicates allies will remain, how much the lack of allies now leads to 
crisis events, or how strong a stress response is needed for modern
crisis events.
