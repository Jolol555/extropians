<a name="0763qlink5">I'd say leave each to his or her own selection. Just as in today's 
dichotomy there are variations on gender attributes. If you've ever 
seen the silliness of the Jerry Springer show, you can see this in 
it's most extreme of actions. When left on it's own natural course, 
there are bisexuals, transvestites, homosexuals, heterosexual's and 
some who dabble in a little of each.</a> 
<br>
<a name="0763qlink6">Might the future society do more of the same but with further 
advances of varieties? 
<br>
Maybe I could be a boy for a day? Or could exude a little more 
testosterone one day and then a little more estrogen for a different 
situation. Ying and yang?</a>
<br>
There may be different idea's of adaptablity incorperated by strong 
differences of infuluence. We may not even yet to fathom the full 
spectrum of possibilities.

<a href="0750.html#0752qlink1">&gt;Having two genders is an important part of the survival strategy for </a><br>
many
<br>
<a href="0750.html#0752qlink2">&gt;species.  Our biology and psychology is well-adapted to this the two-</a><br>
gender survival strategy.
<br>
<a href="0750.html#0752qlink3">&gt;Moving humans to a single gender for both sexes could have a long-</a><br>
term impact on the survivability of the species.  After all, every 
aspect of both genders is extremely useful under some circumstance.  
Having two genders allows a species to embody multiple conflicting 
characteristics, which appears to be a strategy to maximize 
adaptability; to a certain extent, differences between cultures would 
seem to be a manifestion of a
<br>
<a href="0750.html#0752qlink4">&gt;selection process among the large number of characteristics found </a><br>
across
<br>
<i>&gt;both genders.  </i><br>
<a href="0750.html#0752qlink5">&gt;Cultural artifacts such as patriarchy and matriarchy would then seem </a><br>
todemonstrate selection for attributes that are closely tied to 
gender.  Achange in the selection pressures among the two genders 
will inevitably
<br>
<a href="0750.html#0752qlink6">&gt;change the culture as well, and I think history is full of examples </a><br>
of this.  For example, civilizations that are becoming increasingly 
dependant on skill specialization have decreased the value of some 
male-specific characteristics that can probably be linked to most 
patriarchal cultures.
<br>
<a href="0750.html#0752qlink7">&gt;IMO, skill specialization has done more to decrease the amount of</a><br>
<i>&gt;patriarchy in Western civilization than any other factor by </i><br>
selecting for
<br>
<a href="0750.html#0752qlink8">&gt;attributes that are common to both genders.  However, future </a><br>
evolutionary
<br>
<a href="0750.html#0752qlink9">&gt;pressures may lead to cultures that are (necessarily?) strongly </a><br>
female or
<br>
<a href="0750.html#0752qlink10">&gt;male dominant.</a><br>
