<p>
The connection between the shooters and Ritalin is a curious coincidence.
Like amphetamines and other similar stimulants, Ritalin can cause
psychosis, mental instability, and other similar problems in some people.

<p>
Given the heavy usage of Ritalin for kids these days, I would not find it
surprising that it is inducing dangerous mental states in some people.
This could very possibly account for the increase in violence among kids</a> in
recent years.  I think it would behoove the public to explore this angle a
little bit further.
