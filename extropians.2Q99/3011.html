<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Before we can do very much about the</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     1. Some people are much better/smarter than other people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Guns make no distinction at all in this regard. Dead is dead.</i><br>

<p>
That is true. Dead is dead, no matter whether you are the criminal or the victim, but there is a
qualitative difference between which is still alive after a crime is commited and which is not.

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Absolutely.  These are the areas we should be discussing, not the</i><br>

Untill you have a solution, stop denigrating those of us with our fingers in the dike.
