'Fraid so.  Money is tight, the ATV is the primary project at this
time, and we have a week left before all of us in propulsion are out
the door. We're going to press on to get a hot firing on the
centrifuge, one way or another- we might damage it, but at this
point it's the best thing we can do with that asset.  Parting out
the centrifuge would be worth maybe a few thousand dollars;
demonstrating rocket firing with centrifugal pumping in a 1500 gee
field would be very, very valuable.  It's the best use of limited
resources.

I have several prospects, so I can take this rather philosophically.
