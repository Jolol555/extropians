<p>
Yes, I suppose so.  But the justice system as we have it allows for false
</a>
arrest and malicious prosecution redress only in very limited
circumstances.  It almost never happens that a suspect who is acquitted
at trial goes back and successfully sues or prosecutes those who accused,
arrested, and tried him.  O.J. has not.  It seems as if 'honest mistakes'
by the system are allowed to go unpunished.  One libertarian has proposed
that in death penalty cases the jury vote on the death penaly for the
<a name="0232qlink3">convicted.  If, after the convict is executed, he is later proven not
guilty, then those jurors who voted for death would themselves be
executed.  I guess the death penalty would be very rarely applied under
that system.</a>

<p>
No, that's not what I was thinking when I wrote that, but your
interpretation is reasonable.  Defense lawyers like to say it's better to
let 10 guilty parties go free than to convict one innocent.  The
Anglo-Saxon 'presumption of innocence' is still with us.
