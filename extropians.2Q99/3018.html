<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The entire gun debate revolves around present-day examples,</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allowed near guns.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; What a paradox. If people were ideal, we wouldn't need guns.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Kind of my point.  Shouldn't we be working out how to achieve this,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rather than promoting access to weaponry?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I see offensive/defensive capability as a sidetrack on the path to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; transhumanism, myself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Until we have acheived this, everyone should be able to protect themselves as they see fit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I see fit to protect myself by, among other things, striving to keep 
guns out of insane, violent and otherwise irresponsible hands.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3011.html#3018qlink2">&gt; Governments are not empowered to protect us. Abdicting the responsibility before attaining the</a><br>
<i>&gt; new ability is shortsighted and illogical.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, no shit, sherlock.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would FAR RATHER discuss technologies which would develop people's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-control and reason such that they are CAPABLE of handling such</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; technologies.  Humans nowadays are barely evolved past monkey stage, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm usually not at all convinced that we have gone beyond monkeys.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Especially en masse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well that is a very politically incorrect topic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I have no real interest in the political actions people ascribe to my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ideas, I just think them, and out they come. If people don't like what I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; say, it's the key between 's' and 'f'</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Before we can do very much about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; situation we have to realize that:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;     1. Some people are much better/smarter than other people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Guns make no distinction at all in this regard. Dead is dead.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is true. Dead is dead, no matter whether you are the criminal or the victim, but there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualitative difference between which is still alive after a crime is commited and which is not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Yeah; in 96% of the homicides, the dead person is the innocent 
victim.  All the more reason to remove guns from criminals' hands.
<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<a name="3071qlink2"><a href="3011.html#3018qlink3">&gt; &gt; &gt;     2. Most of that difference is genetic.</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; True.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;     3. Despite the fact that the education industry is one of the biggest industries in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; country, education technology is still in the stone age (it is not very useful).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Absolutely.  These are the areas we should be discussing, not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ability or otherwise to shoot people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Untill you have a solution, stop denigrating those of us with our fingers in the dike.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Maybe your fingers are in the dike personally, but you're defending 
the perpetuation of a societal flood of gun-related homicide at the 
trigger-happy hands of people who shouldn't even have guns in 
theirs in the first place.
