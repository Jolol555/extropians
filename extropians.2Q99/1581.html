The universe is infinite and therefore has enough room to handle a Jupiter-sized
brain for everyone if so desired. Once we figure out how the human brain works,
see <a href="http://www-hbp.scripps.edu/home.html">http://www-hbp.scripps.edu/home.html</a>  and how to achieve full mental
satisfaction, we will better understand what effect such full mental
satisfaction will have on current paradigms such as material desire, and
therefore know which technologies to give priority toward in order to satisfy
the same. Of course if we find the ability to reach a place beyond Utopia
(Entopia), where humans exist in a state of pure energy, then all these material
world issues become academic.
