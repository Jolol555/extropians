Eliezer, I apologize for my condescending tone.  It was rude and
inconsiderate, and I was generalizing too much.  I wish I'd stuck
with jesting, or better yet, not made my first wiseass post.</a>

<p>
You are a specialist, I'm a gadfly generalist, and I should make
more effort to remember that we are quite different.  I'd be a fool
to think I know better than you what's best for you- sorry for the
lapse.

<p>
While that Heinlein quote is cute, it's obviously wrong from an
economic and societal point of view- else the vast array of
specialized economic niches would not exist.  We must all be
specialists to some degree, since no single gaussian human (I like
your terminology) can know every human trade and skill.

<p>
I repent me of my foolishness :)
