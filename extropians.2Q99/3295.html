<a href="3063.html#3295qlink1">&gt; In turn, I agree with your point as well.  A child should always be</a><br>
<i>&gt; supervised around any dangerous equipment, whether it is a hot stove or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun.  I was not trying to imply that a five year old is capable of handling</i><br>
<i>&gt; a gun responsibly on their own without supervision.  Generally speaking, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; five year old should never be allowed to handle a firearm except in</i><br>
<i>&gt; strictly controlled environments.  However, you can teach them enough that</i><br>
<i>&gt; when unexpected situations occur (perhaps due to some other parents</i><br>
<i>&gt; irresponsibility), there is a high probability that they will respond</i><br>
<i>&gt; appropriately.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A big part of the problem is that some parents are not fit to supervise.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Guns should get the hot stove, snake and middle of the busy street 
treatment from parents until a child is at least approaching puberty 
and preferably until they're competent to be trusted with a car 
(there is an NRA couple in New England who are now taking their 
THREE YEAR OLD to a target range to practice shoot).
