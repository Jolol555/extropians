Forgive me...  I've been keeping my eye on this debate for a while, and
I've got to admit that it seems to be dealing with problems which just
aren't there.</a>

<p>
I'm a functionalist.  I think that if a thing can pass the Turing test,
that thing is conscious.  I think most people find functionalism
implausible because it claims that certain things are conscious which we
generally wouldn't expect to be conscious.  I don't actually see that as a
problem; my intuition tells me that consciousness is all around us in
places we generally don't expect.

<p>
Is a playback conscious?  Why don't we just Turing test it?  If it passes,
it's conscious.  If it doesn't, it's not.  I have a sneaky suspicion that
<a name="0141qlink1">no ordinary playback will pass any reasonable Turing test.</a>  Barring
extremely improbable playbacks, a playback could not answer a question
like: "I'm going to tell you a random ten digit number, and I'd like for
you to repeat it back to me: 3502580921.  OK.  What was my number?"

<p>
Descartes' "proof" is a logical joke.  If I exist, then I accept the claim
that I exist on pragmatic grounds only.  This is more than enough to
satisfy me, but some people seem to think that claims about their own
existence have a certain pre-logical ontological truth that they simply
don't exhibit.
