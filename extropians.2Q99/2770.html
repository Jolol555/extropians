Greetings,

<p>
I don't normally contribute, but the list is getting real boring now....
I suggest a discussion upon the feasibility of omega point theory.

<a name="2775qlink1">Does anyone else notice the action of planets etc., viewing them as
organisms, which succeed (spawn life/something else), or fail (no geological
activity). Perhaps the same is true for universes. Perhaps this universe is
not as chaotic as we generally believe? Maybe this universe is an optimised
ancestor of an ancient life-spawning-by-chance universe, making lifeforms in
this universe inevitable. What do you think?</a>

<p>
Rob.
