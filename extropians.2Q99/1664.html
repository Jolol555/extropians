<a name="1668qlink1">While I understand the sentiment, the 'don't feel -- think!' quote is IMHO not meant as any sort of anti-extropian or anti-rationalist sentiment. I can only offer that from my own experience as an alpine ski racer as a child and in college that when you are in an athletic endeavor that is as fast paced as slalom racing (or sword/lightsaber fighting) where you very dynamically apply large amounts of force in precise amounts, constantly correcting from sensory feedback, you absolutely cannot depend on (and must often totally ignore) what your concious rational mind is telling you. It is what the cybernetics people call 'right brain' thinking, where you have developed such a large body of experience in the movements that it becomes second nature, where you can whip through a world cup slalom course while still thinking about laying on a beach. This is what I believe is meant by the quote.</a>
