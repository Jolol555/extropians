Nevertheless, life as we know it is coming to an end.  It's not a question
of what anybody wants or doesn't want.  Once you let the genome out of the
bottle, there is no putting it back.  You just have to deal with it.  

<p>
What's happening is that a new life form is emerging.  It isn't going to be
goo, it's just going to be something different.  When oxygen-breathing
cells replaced anaerobic cells as the dominant life form on this planet,
the result wasn't goo.  The result was just the world we live in.  

<p>
We do have a choice about what kind of life form we turn into -- that's the
whole point.  Evolution is no longer a matter of chance.  We are entering
the era of self-directed evolution.

Does that mean somebody is going to throw a pie in my face?
