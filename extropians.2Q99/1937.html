<a name="1939qlink1">No, in fact it might be a good thing to see if something like a
(semi-)automatic perfusion/cooling machine couldn't be made

<a name="1939qlink2">help a lot if the initial phases of a cryotransport were simplified
so that all you had to to is place the deceased in a capsule, 
and push a couple of buttons. The washout might require
some extra human assistence (plugging in the tubes etc.),</a>
<a name="1939qlink3">but external cooling (and perhaps internal as well, using</a> the
<a name="1939qlink4">cryovent cooling/oxigenating system) could be easily automated.
Saves everybody a lot of trouble, and looks really neat (the
capsule, I mean).
