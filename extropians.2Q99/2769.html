<a name="2780qlink1">While most bows, even of the compund type, are bulky, they are no more</a> so than a
<a name="2780qlink2">rifle. There are small folding pistol sized crossbows which are easily
concealed. I think that the main reasons criminals do not use</a> such weapons is
<a name="2780qlink3">because a) they are opportunists, they take opportunities</a> to commit crimes as
<a name="2780qlink4">they present themselves. Very few crimes are plotted out and planned</a> in detail,
<a name="2780qlink5">and those are the types which are typically gotten away</a> with, because they
<a name="2780qlink6">minimize witnesses and dispose of evidence. b) criminals are not patient.</a> Very
<a name="2780qlink7">few criminals have the patience to stalk their victims</a> for extended periods
<a name="2780qlink8">(stalkers are of course the exception), c) while a bow gives</a> the advantages of
<a name="2780qlink9">silence, a home-made silencer for a pistol can be made</a> with a plastic motor oil
<a name="2780qlink10">container stuffed with toilet paper, d) the lack of regulatory</a> paperwork needed
<a name="2780qlink11">to obtain bows is countered by the criminals willingness to purchase</a> guns on the
black market.

<p>
<a name="2780qlink12">Despite this, I still see a bow as having advantages, not the least</a> being that
<a name="2780qlink13">if caught, you are likely to serve a lesser sentence for a crime</a> done with a bow
<a name="2780qlink14">rather than a firearm, as well as the fact that kevlar body armor</a> is useless
<a name="2780qlink15">against a hunting arrow, which may become an important factor if</a> body armor
<a name="2780qlink16">becomes popular for civilians now that it is legal for them</a> to purchase it. I'm
<a name="2780qlink17">not sure of the penetrability of kevlar/titanium layered body armor,</a> but that is
<a name="2780qlink18">not yet available for civilian use.
