 A study was done on 7'th Day Adventists, which found the main
determinants of mortality in these semi-vegetarians was meat consumption,
and nut consumption. Meat eaters had a higher mortality rate, while nut
consumers had a lower mortality. Other studies have found little relation
between over-all fat consumption and mortality. However when different
types of dietary fats are considered, saturated and hydrogenated fats
were found to increase mortality, while monounsaturated, and
polyunsaturated lowered it. Some studies have found omega-3 polys to be
particularly beneficial. Salad eaters enjoyed a lower mortality rate in
one study, which was found to be dependant on the amount of omega-3
containing salad dressing consumed, and not as one would think the amount
of vegetables ingested.

 Whether dieting is healthy would seem to be entirely dependant on how it
is implimented. Giving up heart healthy fat (and arginine) rich nuts would
appear to be a particularly bad dietary strategy.
