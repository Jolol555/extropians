White house cracked

<p>
One of the web servers (www1) for the Whitehouse was cracked. According to 
information learned by HNN this crack took place at aprox 8:50am EST on May 
10th. (Other news outlets are claiming it happened at midnight EST on May 
9th) Unlike reports from about one month a ago that claimed whitehouse.gov 
was cracked this time there is enough viable evidence to support the 
allegation. CNN is reporting that whitehouse spokes people are blaming this 
on equipment failure. HNN has been able to secure a copy of the cracked 
page.


<p>
Here's the original page that was attacked;

<p>
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">http://www.whitehouse.gov/</a>

<p>
And here's the left cracked page (per hacker news)

US Embassy and DOE web sites Cracked

<p>
In response to the recent NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade 
some people have started attacking web sites. The US Embassy in China, The 
DOE, and the Department of Interior are a few of the web sites that have had 
their web pages changed as a direct result of the bombings. Most of the 
slogans posted on the pages are extremely anti USA and NATO and and evoke 
Chinese nationalism and patriotism.
