Title
<br>
  (R)-alpha-lipoic acid-supplemented old rats have improved
  mitochondrial function, decreased oxidative damage, and increased metabolic
  rate.

Abstract
<br>
  A diet supplemented with (R)-lipoic acid, a mitochondrial
  coenzyme, was fed to old rats to determine its efficacy in reversing the
  decline in metabolism seen with age. Young (3 to 5 months) and old (24 to 26
  months) rats were fed an AIN-93M diet with or without (R)-lipoic
  acid (0.5% w/w) for 2 wk, killed, and their liver
  parenchymal cells were isolated. Hepatocytes from untreated old rats vs.
  young controls had significantly lower oxygen consumption (P&lt;0. 03) and
  mitochondrial membrane potential. (R)-Lipoic acid
  supplementation reversed the age-related decline in O2 consumption and
  increased (P&lt;0.03) mitochondrial membrane potential. Ambulatory activity, a
  measure of general metabolic activity, was almost threefold lower in
  untreated old rats vs. controls, but this decline was reversed (P&lt;0.005) in
  old rats fed (R)-lipoic acid. The increase of oxidants with
  age, as measured by the fluorescence produced on oxidizing
  2',7'-dichlorofluorescin, was significantly lowered in (R)-lipoic
  acid supplemented old rats (P&lt;0.01). Malondialdehyde (MDA)
  levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were increased fivefold with age
  in cells from unsupplemented rats. Feeding rats the (R)-lipoic
  acid diet reduced MDA levels markedly (P&lt;0.01). Both
  glutathione and ascorbic acid levels declined in hepatocytes
  with age, but their loss was completely reversed with (R)-lipoic
  acid supplementation. Thus, (R)-lipoic acid
  supplementation improves indices of metabolic activity as well as lowers
  oxidative stress and damage evident in aging.
