Greg,

<p>
Thanks for the clarification, and your even and calm response.  I just
wanted the record clear about my actions.

<p>
Now that you cleared that up, it is only fair that I respond in kind.  I was
busy pushing my own point, and did not respond to your points about ExI.

<p>
I totally support ExI's right to run the list as they see fit.  While I was
emphasizing my personal preference against topic bans, it probably appeared
that I was disagreeing with the running of this list.  Although I personally
dislike topic bans, I am an extremely strong believer in owner's rights.
ExI can and should do anything they want to help the list.  I have no
problem with what ExI is doing, and think it is a logical and reasonable
response.  It would not have been my response, but I have no problem with
other people making different choices than me.
