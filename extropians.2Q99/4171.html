simple

<a href="4151.html#4171qlink5">&gt; &gt;  process of moderating the mailing list into full-blown court drama.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I apologize for the use of a word, Harvey that is very much in the idiom</i><br>
of
<br>
<a href="4151.html#4171qlink6">&gt; my personal and professional life.  Let me note that in fact what you and</a><br>
<i>&gt; Jeff did was very much, however, in the spirit of private law enforcement</i><br>
<i>&gt; that at least some extropians are quite interested in.</i><br>
<i>&gt; [long explaination snipped]</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4184qlink1">Greg, I agreed with everything you wrote.</a>  However, I think you missed my
point.<a name="4184qlink2">  I don't object to the terminology.  They way you wrote it sounds
like I am working behind the scenes with you to get people banned from this
<a name="4184qlink3">list.</a>  I have been receiving a lot of hate mail because of this.</a>  I wanted
<a name="4184qlink4">to make it clear that I have not communicated with you.  When I tried to
clarify this, your response says that what I did was very much</a> in the spirit
<a name="4184qlink5">of private law enforcement.  I don't know what I did.</a>

<p>
<a name="4184qlink6">Please tell me specifically what you are referencing.</a>  Please clarify to the
<a name="4184qlink7">rest of the list that I have not submitted anything to you directly.</a>
<a name="4184qlink8">Anything you have you have grabbed from my postings on the list.</a>  I don't
<a name="4184qlink9">see how I could have helped anyway.  To enforce your ban, you need to look
at what each person has posted.  I have no idea how my postings could help
you look at other people's postings.</a>

<p>
<a name="4184qlink10">You seem to keep implying that you couldn't or wouldn't be able to ban
people from this list without my help.</a>  I want to be clearly on the record
<a name="4184qlink11">as being opposed to subject bans and opposed to unsubscribing people</a> for the
<a name="4184qlink12">topics of their discussion.  People should only be banned for their
behavior.</a>

<p>
<a name="4184qlink13"><a href="4151.html#4171qlink7">&gt; As for having a "full-blown court drama", let me offer some brief</a><br>
<i>&gt; observations about the process.  Libertarians (in the most general sense</i><br>
of
<br>
<a href="4151.html#4171qlink8">&gt; the word) need to be flexible.  When you condemn authoritarianism, you</a><br>
<i>&gt; necessarily have to embrace the fact that social systems should</a> be able to</i><br>
<a name="4184qlink14"><i>&gt; respond flexibly to evolving facts.  As a result, due process becomes a</i><br>
very
<br>
<a href="4151.html#4171qlink9">&gt; high value to libertarians.</a><br>

<p>
That may be.  But you are simply being asked to enforce list rules as a
moderator.  I don't see that you have to set up a court, receive
indictments, or take a week to make decisions after the fact.  As near as I
can tell, ExI originally announced that they would enforce a ban on the gun
topic.  It now appears that you are implementing a "neutral" court</a> under the
<a name="4184qlink15">guise of PPL, and are put the blame on indicting people on me or others.
You are the moderator.  ExI is the list owner.  If you people unsubscribe
people, it is not because of any indictments from me.</a>

<p>
<a name="4184qlink16">Again, please confirm to the list:


</a>
<UL>
  <li>  that I am not working private with you
  <li>  that I have given you nothing
<a name="4184qlink17">  <li>  that all you have are archives of this list</a> itself
<a name="4184qlink18">  <li>  and please explain to everyone (including me!) what exactly</a> you have that
<a name="4184qlink19">you are calling "indictments" from</a> me


</UL>
<p>
Thanks.
