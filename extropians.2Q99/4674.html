<p>
Do any extropians out there have BVH motion capture files?

<p>
I'm starting to explore the gestural languages of mental states, and 
am looking for ways to encode body exercises and muscle/tactile 
forces and motions.

<p>
Metacreations just released Poser4.  I called their customer service 
department today; there's a 45 day envelope for a free upgrade from 
Poser3 (available mail order for $140.95).

<p>
I'm not sure if BVH motion capture is precise enough to encode such 
actions as grinding your teeth (where there is little motion, but 
lots of muscle force change), or balancing on one heal (again, the 
position stays the same, but there is a lot of distributed change in 
force).

<p>
I imagine that texture maps could include sensory maps of various 
tactile forces: heat, electrostatic charge, pressure, pain, whatever. 
 Someone, somewhere, might have a library of encoded expressions, 
that could be placed into the public domain for free redistribution.

marijuana.  I'd very much like to participate in a controlled study 
where I get into the mnemonic aspects of gesture state changes, 
timing, and there unconscious cueing effects.</a>
