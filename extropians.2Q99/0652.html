To which Eliezer Yudkowsky replied, in one of the most amazing 
non sequiturs to appear on the list in a long time -- at least in the last
couple of hours --

<a name="0667qlink2"><a href="0577.html#0652qlink4">&gt; I'm so glad to know that submarines will never outswim fish. </a><br>

<p>
What on earth is this in reference to?  

<p>
Hard life will, as I have said repeatedly, have an advantage over soft
life.  However, microscopic hard life won't have an advantage over
large-scale hard life any more than bacteria have an advantage over
mammals.  Hard life will come in all sizes, from microbes to submarines.

natural organisms.</a>

<i>&gt; It is possible to have replicators that use different materials and have</i><br>

<p>
Eliezer created a hilarious skit in which the punch line is 

<p>
<a href="0578.html#0652qlink6">&gt; "And look!" cried Anders Sandburg, pointing at the monitors. </a><br>
<i>&gt; "The goo, being biological, can't eat our facility and </i><br>
<i>&gt; condemn us all to horrible, agonizing deaths! We're saved!"</i><br>

<p>
When it comes to satire, I'm afraid I am outgunned.  There is no use trying
to compete with such deadly wit.  But leaving humor aside, let's try to
find the logic in this.  

<p>
Mitchell Porter used the word "nonbiological" to mean that the hypothetical
new organisms will be mechanical, unlike the organisms that exist in
nature.  My point was that even if the new organisms are nonbiological in
that sense, they still must be biological in a more general sense.  There
<a name="0687qlink2">will be an entire ecology of mechanical replicators.  They will eat each
other, reproduce, evolve, and in general play the same roles in their
ecosystem that natural organisms play in the present ecosystem.  This
doesn't imply that they won't be a threat to natural life.  Far from</a> it.  

<p>
I wrote, 
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0652qlink7">&gt; Hard life, like natural life, will be constrained by time, space, and</a><br>
<i>&gt; energy; there will still be such a thing as bioenergetics. Each species</i><br>
<i>&gt; will have its own niche. There will still be predators and prey, and</i><br>
there
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0652qlink8">&gt; will still be an ongoing arms race between predators and prey, as</a><br>
described
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0652qlink9">&gt; by Dawkins. There will still be symbiotic relationships and parasitic</a><br>
<i>&gt; relationships between species. In other words the general form of biology</i><br>
<i>&gt; will remain the same. The essential difference will be that organisms</i><br>
will
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0652qlink10">&gt; be able to change themselves, like corporations do, instead of depending</a><br>
on
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0652qlink11">&gt; the blind process of natural selection.</a><br>

<p>
To which Eliezer responded  
<br>
<a name="0667qlink3"><a href="0577.html#0652qlink12">&gt; Yes; submarines might be more of a problem if the population </a><br>
<i>&gt; was not kept down by the submarine-eating denizens of the deep. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="0663qlink1">If there were predatory submarines, then there would indeed be
submarine-eating denizens of the deep, i.e. other submarines.</a>  They would
<a name="0667qlink4">eat each other.  They would also be subject to attack by smaller a-life
creatures.  Microscopic a-life creatures ("goo") would be more interested
in attacking submarines than in attacking us. In other words, the submarine
population would be kept in check just like the population of any other
organism is kept in check.</a>  
</a>

<p>
I wrote
<br>
<a name="0667qlink5"><a href="0570.html#0652qlink13">&gt; 3. Finally, the other fantastic thing about the grey goo scenario is that</a><br>
<i>&gt; it is all supposed to happen overnight.</i><br>

<p>
Eliezer interrupted at this point and said  
<br>
<a href="0577.html#0652qlink14">&gt; Says you. It could just as well happen after a decade. </a><br>
<i>&gt; Straw man. Nobody specified overnight.</i><br>

<p>
The word "overnight" is a figure of speech, meaning "suddenly."  My
<a name="0716qlink2">understanding of the goo scenario is that even if it takes a decade to
start, once it does start it is supposed to happen very quickly indeed.</a></a> 
<a name="0667qlink6">The goo is going to "eat our facility and condemn us all to horrible,
agonizing deaths!"  That scenario is fantastic, and the word "overnight" is
not out of place in describing it.  Nor is the word "overnight" out of
place in describing a scenario in which an entire new kind of life is
designed and built in a decade.</a>   

<p>
There are two distinct questions concerning the speed of the goo process: 
(1) Whether a-life will be ready to shrink wrap in a decade or so, and (2)
how quickly it will spread once it gets started.  The calibration principle
can be applied to both of these questions.  

<p>
My statement continued, 
<br>
<i>&gt; I wish it were that easy to design new cells.  I spend </i><br>
<a href="0570.html#0652qlink15">&gt; a lot of time trying to figure out how to redesign my own cells.  </a><br>
<i>&gt; It's a daunting task, and I think it will take decades </i><br>
<i>&gt; just to make the first steps.  Replicators are complex, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; that complexity isn't going to go away. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="0667qlink7">Here I am trying to get a handle on question #1 above, by considering the
difficulty I have had in redesigning my own cells.  Ignoring this, Eliezer
chose to focus on the word "overnight."  So who's attacking a straw man? 
Instead of taking the word "overnight" literally, why don't you reply to
the statement "Replicators are complex, and that complexity isn't going to
go away"?</a> 


<p>
Let's reframe the question.  Consider corporations to be a form of a-life,
and look at what is happening in the Amazonian rain forest, and other rain
forests.  The natural ecosystem is being destroyed by artificial organisms
with chain saws, and it can't defend itself.  It doesn't even know it is
being attacked -- which is the whole problem.  Corporations are aware of
themselves and their environment, and they can make plans.  Rain forests
are not aware of themselves and their environment, and they can't make
plans.  Therefore they are being cut to pieces.  This is happening most
conspicuously to rain forests, but the same thing is happening to the
entire natural ecosystem.  This is the real goo problem.  It has already
started.  It will continue.  We are caught in the middle -- we are part of
the natural ecosystem, but we are also at the center of corporations.  Our
role is ambiguous, and it will continue to be ambiguous.  As Pogo would
say:  We have met the goo and it is us.
