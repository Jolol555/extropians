Hi All,
<p>
    Everybody else is putting their $0.02 in, so here goes mine.  The level
of discussion has been both extraordinarily good and terribly monotonous in
different threads.
<p>
    The level of interesting technical posts and threads has definitely
picked up recently.  Thank you all for making my dendrites grow!!
<p>
    A while ago I thanked Mike Lorrey for running "moron patrol" on the list
in a private email.  Mike was quick to point out that newbies might just
need additional guidance and that I was being intolerant.  He was right on.
Although certain recent posts have added very little to intelligent
discussion, I would hope we can still salvage their ability to add to our
cause (even though the process may be painful).  If they won't take gentle
guidance though, the best course of action is just noncommunication (it is
impossible to debate rationally with a static mind).  More effective though
would be to show the poster the error of his/her ways without antagonizing
them.

<p>
I can't agree more with what David Lubkin says:
<br>
<a href="1724.html#1730qlink1">&gt;See also Heinlein's emphasis on and rationale for manners.</a><br>

<p>
Some thoughts from the master:

<p>
"Moving parts in rubbing contact require lubrication to avoid excessive
wear.  Honorifics and formal politeness provide lubrication where people rub
together."

<p>
For David Musick:
<br>
"Beware of altruism.  It is based on self-deception, the root of all evil."

<p>
For Mike Lorrey:
<br>
"The correct way to punctuate a sentence that starts: "Of course it is none
my business but ..." is to place a period after the word "but".  Don't use
excessive force in supplying such moron with a period.  Cutting his throat
is only a momentary pleasure and is bound to get you talked about."

<p>
