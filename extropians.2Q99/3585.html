Dear Emlyn:

<p>
Point very well---though sadly, frustratingly---taken.  Are we DOOMED, 
however, to an endlessly escalating techno-war (forgive me, by the way, for 
that term, since it IS, admittedly, rather redundant!!) of 
defense/aggression?!?!!  One would, of course, certainly HOPE not!!  Yet 
such an endless escalation MAY indeed be in the offing.  Is there any way(s) 
out??<a name="3596qlink1">  Will so-called "ultra-rationality" (WHATEVER the hell THAT is!) 
finally bring a halt to such MAD (as it were) escalation(s)?!?  Again, one 
would HOPE so!</a>  What is the root cause(s) of aggression??  Powerlust?  OK, 
then what's the root cause(s) of powerlust?!?  If we're talking power over 
nature, or wealth, or, as it might be termed, generalized (or generic) 
WHEREWITHAL, that's ONE thing, but what of 
<br>
(oppressive)power-over-other-persons?  What's up with THAT??  Both Rand and <br>
Dave Norton (among others) claim that it's both immoral and psychologically 
screwed-up to have a desire for this latter kind of power.  So long as there 
is(are) scarcity(s) of one sort(s) or another, need there be conflict---and, 
if so, must this conflict(s) necessarily be resolved via zero-sum 
aggression??!?

<p>
Your thoughts, Emlyn, and EVERYONE ELSE'S on all this shall be, of course!, 
greatly and enthusiastically appreciated.

<p>
Many of the moral-psychological themes in Dave Norton's PERSONAL DESTINIES 
are relevant to this thread, BTW.

beside my mouse just a moment ago........)
