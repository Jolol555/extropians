<p>
I'm sorry everyone keeps taking me to be female,</a> maybe my communication
<a name="3411qlink2">style is too effeminate?</a> Maybe I should take up a more easily recognised
handle, which is very male (Death Lord Zod?) rather than my real name, which
causes confusion. This is an interesting problem in the light of the thread
about representing yourself honestly on the net, because I have been, and
it's not really getting the correct impression across.

<p>
If only the famous Emlyns (an elite group to be sure) were known outside the
UK... Also, I have heard of at least one instance of Emlyn as a woman's
name.</a>

<p>
<a name="3411qlink3">Actually this doesn't bother me personally - it's actually really
interesting to be in a position like this. It is a good example of the
elusiveness of identity in fact. For example, in a purely text-based
<a name="3733qlink1">relationship, how is physical gender really relevant? In fact, how many of
the components of your identity really have relevance in such a context.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3411qlink4">We talk a lot about the unknowable post-singularity transhuman future, and
few people conceptualise themselves as having a body in any recognisable,
human sense at all. What then of gender? Will I, born in the 20th century,
but living 10,000 years in the future (hoping), with a distributed
intelligence across planets or built into an interstellar vessel, or
uploaded into a nano-scale brain, still conceive of myself as male? Still
even conceive of myself as a single entity?

<p>
But for now anyway, XY all the way.</a>

<a name="3411qlink5">PS: You're still welcome to use me as an intellectual model for your robot
girlfriend - it's just so perverse, I like it.
