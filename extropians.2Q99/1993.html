&lt;&lt; This may be a weak argument, but to me there seems to be little
 extropian value in enslaving oneself to a gun.  Making a gun one's first
 defense to any threat, imagined or otherwise,  is hardly developing
 yourself as a human.  Non-violence, while less spectacular and seemingly
 slower to get results, is (in my opinion) always to be preferred to a
 violent approach. &gt;&gt;

<p>
I much prefer non-violence. I would bet that everyone on this list prefers 
it, also. I would also bet that the maroity of humans prefer it. 

<p>
But the fact at issue here is not non-violence vs. violence (or violence as " 
one's first defense to any threat, imagined or otherwise" ), but whether or 
not individuals ought to be allowed to own guns.

<p>
The problem with banning guns is, ultimately, that one's life is one's 
<a name="2015qlink1">responsibility to support and defend. Just as one ought to be free</a> to make</a> a 
<a name="2015qlink2">living ( a basically libertarian premise) one also ought to be free to 
<br>
*protect* that life. And so long as there exists a threat of a forceful <br>
attack on oneself, it is quite prudent to have the means to protect your 
</a>life. 

<p>
<a name="2009qlink2">A completely centralized protection agency (like police) is inefficient in 
the same way for the same reasons as a completely centralized economic 
planner. The problem of information ( Who needs protection? How do I choose 
amongst competing claims? ) ultimately makes centralization fail (among other 
reasons).

<p>
<a name="2015qlink3">Finally, besides personal responsibility and central inefficiency, I think 
that thinking that one can legislate virtue in a populace is incorrect. A 
society emerges from a group of people, and a virtuous society</a> emerges from a 
<a name="2015qlink4">group of virtuous citizens. Its a "bottom-up" phenomenon, not a "top-down"</a></a> 
one.

<p>
<a name="2009qlink3">Well, I hope I've added something constructive here.

PS- What are some good "top-down" phenomena? That is, what are some systems 
<a name="2836qlink1"><a name="2822qlink1">that work well in a "top-down" way?
