<a name="3566qlink1">As Max indicated, he and I as the managing officers of Extropy Institute (the 
sponsoring organization for this list) believe that some action is necessary 
to address questions of list content that have arisen here in the last few 
weeks.  I will be communicating soon with Eugene about his kind offer of 
acting as list moderator and we may well take him up on that proposition in 
the near future.  In the meantime, we are taking some rough-and-ready action 
to restore balance to the content of the list.</a>

<p>
<a name="3928qlink1"><a name="3566qlink2">             PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY:

<p>
<a name="4017qlink3"><a name="3951qlink3"><a name="3950qlink3"><a name="3948qlink3"><a name="3947qlink3"><a name="3946qlink3"><a name="3945qlink3"><a name="3944qlink3"><a name="3943qlink3"><a name="3942qlink3"><a name="3939qlink3">As a temporary measure in response to the extreme number of postings</a> that 
have been generated<a name="3928qlink2"> by a small number of posters on a single topic, the 
</a>
<a name="3564qlink1">subject of "guns" will be considered<a name="3928qlink3"> off-topic for the list for a period of 
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
two weeks beginning</a> on Saturday, June 12, 1999 at 12:01 am PST.  Again as a 
<a name="4017qlink4"><a name="3951qlink4"><a name="3950qlink4"><a name="3948qlink4"><a name="3947qlink4"><a name="3946qlink4"><a name="3945qlink4"><a name="3944qlink4"><a name="3943qlink4"><a name="3942qlink4"><a name="3939qlink4">temporary measure, any posters continuing existing "gun" threads, starting 
<a name="3928qlink4">new ones or raising the subject of "guns" in existing threads during</a> this 
two-week period will<a name="3928qlink5"> be unsubscribed from the list for a period of three 
</a>
months.  Please note that this prohibition will go<a name="3928qlink6"> into effect in a little 
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
over 24 hours.  Accordingly, there is plenty of time to draft a civil, 
reasoned<a name="3928qlink7"> summation of whatever views any subscriber may wish to express</a> and 
post them to the list.

<p>
<a name="3928qlink8">Because this is a temporary measure intended to restore balance</a> and civility 
to the list, I will<a name="3928qlink9"> be the sole judge of whether a post during the period is 
</a>
in violation of the prohibition on posts<a name="3928qlink10"> concerning "guns".  If you have any 
</a>
doubt regarding whether a message you are considering<a name="3928qlink11"> posting to the list may 
</a>
be in violation of this temporary prohibition, it probably is: Hold your 
<a name="3928qlink12">breath, count to ten and let whatever you have to say wait until we</a> work out 
some way<a name="3928qlink13"> to accommodate this discussion in a way that does not flood the 
</a>
list.  Substituting discussion<a name="3928qlink14"> of some weapon other than a hand-held 
</a>
chemically-powered projectile device for "gun" will not<a name="3928qlink15"> make a post 
</a>
acceptable during this brief cooling-off period.  Everyone with enough 
<a name="3956qlink3">intelligence<a name="3928qlink16"> and emotional maturity to be a welcome poster to this list 
</a>
should know what subjects will<a name="3928qlink17"> be considered temporarily off-topic.</a>

<p>
This action should not be interpreted as a "victory" or a "defeat" for the 
substance of any position that has been espoused in the "gun debate" here, 
but is undertaken with great reluctance as a measure to impose the minimum of 
</a>decorum and editorial judgment on a topic that has grown to become a 
disproportionate part of the volume of this list's content.

<p>
<a name="3568qlink1">Finally, a personal note.  I regret that this temporary action is necessary, 
do not relish whatever controversy it may cause and sincerely hope that this 
episode will not establish any precedent for future list governance.  (Those 
familiar with Roman history should consider the figure of Cincinatus as the 
only guide to which I will look in this brief interlude.)</a>
