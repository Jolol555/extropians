I agree with other list members that 'The Matrix' was an excellent movie.
In some places the movie is very intelligent and in others its not.
However, relative to the other "futuristic" movies Hollywood has offered,
'The Matrix' certainly sits in a select group at the top tier.  I also agree
<a name="0109qlink1">we shouldn't spoil the fun for other list members by discussing details of
the movie before our list peers have a chance to see it themselves (though I
hope our list members outside the U.S. won't be too cross with us for not
waiting til the movie debuts in their locales).</a>  Let's say that April 9th is
the date we'll start discussing the movie openly on the list.
