One of the most powerful attributes of the extropy meme relates to the way
it sympathetically supports all approaches to expanding and improving
sentient life, while focusing on emerging technologies. I like that.

<p>
Perhaps we put the extropian cart before the conventional horse when we
attempt to gain life eternal without first comprehending life.

Wilson's work on consilience represents a milestone in the unification of
<a name="1283qlink1">all the sciences, the social as well as the natural sciences. Highly
recommended reading, and if any senior members of this list would like to
open a thread on the subject, I'd joyfully engage it (as a self-evidently
junior subscriber, of course).</a>
