Talk to an old engineer, and one will discover that in the not-too-recent
past, each engineer was supported by 3-5 clerical/support people:
draftsmen, secretaries.

<p>
Talk to an old machinist, and one will discover that not too long ago,
machines were made by hand.  Now CNC mills do much of that work.
Even tool-making is becoming automated.

<p>
Ten years ago, plastic mold cavity design was an art.  Now my brother
has software that does shrinkage and tolerancing, letting him produce
more molds in less time than ever, and produce tool-path calculations
for the CNC mill (which was formerly a highly-paid specialty).

<p>
I think that computer programming is the next frontier.  We already have
genetic
<br>
programming.
