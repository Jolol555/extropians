<i>&gt;More info?</i><br>

<p>
     There have been 3 episodes so far. 13 exist. Whether or not there will 
be more is a mystery at present.

<p>
     It is on TNT, Wednesday night, 10 PM where I live. You live in Oz, 
right? (Praise Kylie Minogue and all her works!) I do not know about TV 
there.

<p>
     If you can find it, it looks like next week's episode has some 
flashback to the Shadow War.

<i>&gt;distance?</i><br>

<p>
     Well, in case you do not know this already, JMS intended the show to go 
for 5 years but it looked like he might have had to wrap it up in 4. The 
last episode, SLEEPING IN LIGHT was really meant to follow either RISING 
STAR or THE DECONSTRUCTION OF FALLING STARS at the end of season 4 and was 
actually shot at that time. Anyway, SLEEPING IN LIGHT depicts terminal 
events as "prophesied"; so no surprises, but it is a good episode.
The very definitively terminal event at the very end made me cry like a 
woman (except that I was sincere) and it was JMS, himself, in a cameo role 
that performed it.

<p>
     Still, a couple of questions are left unanswered.
