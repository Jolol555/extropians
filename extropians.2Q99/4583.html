<p>
And as long as I'm dispelling cultural myths masquerading as sage wisdom:


<UL>
  <li>  Saying to yourself: "I'm just having fun as part of a greater goal,
not because of any intrinsic significance" does NOT diminish the amount
of fun.  Thought is NOT the enemy of pleasure.

  <li>  You can consider the possibility that life is meaningless, or that the
Earth is going to be dissolved into a puddle of goo, or that everything
you try is just going to make things worse, or your own nonexistence,
and it will NOT fuse your brain into a lump.

  <li>  It's possible to believe that the world has only a 30% chance of
surviving to Singularity, and STILL have a sense of humor.  In fact, I
believe I've posted more original humor to this list than any three
other individuals.

  <li>  Devoting your life to a Cause is NOT the exclusive province of the
young, except maybe in the second half of the twentieth century.  (Sigh.
 What happened to the 1850s?)

  <li>  It is possible to keep everything in perspective, thinking of six
billion people or a hundred billion galaxies or entire Alpha Lines,
WITHOUT either overloading your brain or being crushed by your own
insignificance.  It's just numbers.

  <li>  You don't have to set aside even an infinitesimal fraction of your
life for yourself.  Any fun required to keep heart and soul together can
be performed out a sense of duty and it will STILL WORK.

  <li>  If you don't expect loneliness, you won't be lonely.  If you don't
conceive of altruism as a huge self-sacrifice, it doesn't require
willpower.  If you don't focus on the television-potential drama of your
choices, there's nothing agonizing about them.  If you don't believe
you're a martyr, YOU AREN'T A MARTYR.


</UL>
<p>
If I choose to live my life for the Singularity, nobody has any right to
demand that I live it for myself.
