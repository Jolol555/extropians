WARNING ! ! !    Partial Story Spoilage "Methuselah's Children" ! ! !

<p>
The plot twist that had the greatest impact on me was when, M's children
returned to Earth years later.  They were still worried that they would be
hunted down because everyone else still believed they possessed some
fountain-of-youth potion.  But it turned out that Earth welcomed them back
with open arms. You see, the Earth scientists were not only convinced that
an anti-aging formula was possible; they believed it had already been
developed.  So they feverishly worked to figure out how it had been done,
unaware that they were inventing...not re-inventing.  Consequently, the
formula was found and everyone received the extended life they believed was
possible.

<p>
What a great message.  Humans have an amazing ability to achieve what they
believe to be possible.  Keep preaching the possibilities.
