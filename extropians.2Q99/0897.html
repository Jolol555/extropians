<a href="0896.html#0897qlink1">&gt; On the other hand, when it struck me - about an hour later - that</a><br>
<i>&gt; categories like "self-reliant" were being categorized as "male" while</i><br>
<i>&gt; "placatory" was supposed to be "female", I screamed and threw my monitor</i><br>
<i>&gt; across the room, having realized the breath-taking magnitude of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; casual stereotyping.  Thus I have no intention whatsoever of saying what</i><br>
<i>&gt; my scores were.</i><br>

<p>
Of course it's stereotyping.  Of course it's prejudiced.  That's
the point of it: to measure how a person evaluates emself with
respect to cultural roles/expectations which are prejudice by
definition.  This isn't about measuring some fundamental attribute
of who you are, it's about measuring some attributes of how you
relate to the prejudiced culture in which you find yourself.

<p>
This test could be used as a tool to fight those stereotypes
just as it might be used to reinforce them.  Whatever numbers
result from passing that particular set of words through your
mind do indeed measure something--what it is can be debated.
Denying the numbers is not debate, just stubbornness.
