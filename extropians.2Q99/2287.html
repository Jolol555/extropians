<a name="2295qlink1"><a href="2282.html#2287qlink1">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; While I agree that the US government is built to avoid things</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like Weimar and Nazi germany atrocities, I'd hardly say that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; "It won't happen here".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Just to provide an historical reminder: it /has/ happenned here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The internment of Japanese-Americans was clearly illegal, but no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one in the chain of command had the courage to stop it.  And need</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I even mention the treatment of American Indians?  Yes, I'm glad</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that our government is set up to make certain kinds of tyranny</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more difficult, but if the public sees something or someone as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; enemy (take "drug user" for example, or "illegal alien"), democracy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; won't get in the way of the people marginalizing or dehumanizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; them.  It takes individuals with conscience, a loud voice, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; means to back it up to fight such trends.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nowhere in my list did I advocate a marginalization of any of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; straw-man groups here profferred, and I personally oppose same</a> as </i><br>
<i>&gt; vociferously as I advocate the passage of the rational, reasonable, </i><br>
<i>&gt; limited and commonsense laws I have previously enumerated (keep </i><br>
<i>&gt; guns from the possession of violent criminals, the mentally </i><br>
<i>&gt; deficient and/or deranged, spouse and/or child abusers, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; children).  To indict A by slagging B is not only logically fallacious, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but intellectually dishonest.</i><br>

<p>
(1) I was replying to the precise text I quoted, which is not from
  you, and had nothing to do with your proposal.  Not every post in
  this thread is about you personally.  Please read it as written.

<p>
(2) I understand that you have a libertarian view of drug use and
  such.  I submit, though, that "mentally incompetent" is an equally
  ill-defined and greatly abusable category, and "violent felon" and
  "child" have problems as well.  I would have no problem with, for
  example, a judge imposing /as part of a convict's sentence/ that
  ey foreits eir right to own a gun for some period of time (up to
  and including life).  But someone who, say, got drunk and slashed
  someone with a broken bottle in a bar fight provoked by someone
  else, was duly convicted, served eir time in jail, and was
  released is now a free citizen like any other, and one hopes might
  have learned from eir mistake.  Automatically removing eir rights
  wihtout opportunity for judgment is unreasonable and unproductive.
  That's what we pay judges for: to exercise judgment.  Blanket
  prohibitions make it harder to do that.

<p>
<a name="2298qlink1"><a name="2295qlink2">  Note also that the recently-proposed bomb-recipe bill in Congress
  makes publishing certain information on the Internet a "Federal
  crime of violence".  If lawmakers can redefine "involuntary
  servitude" so that it doesn't include the draft, surely they can
  redefine "violence" so that it includes writing HTML.</a>  I also
  know some 16/17-year-old girls who are responsible and rational
  enough that I would have no problem with them packing, and for
  whom it might be a good idea in their neighborhoods.</a>
