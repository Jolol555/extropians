<a href="0686.html#0738qlink1">&gt;The real question, then, is what will the supply of investment </a><br>

<p>
The supply of investment capital would always tend to balance the demand
for investment capital, at a given risk level, because the rate of return
is the 'price' which varies to keep them in balance.


<p>
The premise was that 90% of the population is retired, with indefinitely
long life spans, having accumulated much wealth from many years of
compounded returns.  If we assume that the only thing which would cause
them to un-retire would be if the return on their investments fell below
their minimum income standard for retirement, and that they have a
current income which exceeds that standard, then, they each are able to
continue to compound wealth.  As their wealth increases, over time they
need a lower and lower _rate_ of return to meet their minimum income
standard as well as continue to accumulate more wealth.  So it would
appear that at least the possibility of ever declining rates of return
exists, from the investment capital supply side.  For a wealthy investor
with a practically infinite time horizon, a return on investment of .01%
per year might look pretty good.


<p>
As for the demand for capital, that might be determined by population
growth, infrastructure per capita, and the physical rate of
infrastructure depreciation.
