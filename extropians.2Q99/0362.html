Spoilers below for anyone who hasn't read, but intends to read,
the "Hyperion Cantos" (_Hyperion_, _The Fall of Hyperion_) by
Dan Simmons.

<p>
I found the battery concept in 'The Matrix' strongly reminiscent
of one of the plot elements in the Simmons books (similar enough
to have been plausibly borrowed by the movie's screenwriters, though
in a "dumbed-down" form more quickly and easily explainable to a
movie audience).

<p>
Recall that in the Hyperion books, human beings (in an interstellar
polity called the Hegemony) coexist with a community of AIs (called
the TechnoCore).  The humans make use of a technology (largely a
"gift" of the AIs) of a network of teleportation doorways, called
"farcasters", that permit world-spanning homes and shopping malls.
It turns out that the AIs have largely migrated into the
higher-dimensional
<br>
spaces created by this farcaster network (the "interstices of reality"),
but that from this vantage point they (unknown to the humans) "borrow"
or "steal" processor capacity from the humans by timesharing the living
brains of the folks who use the farcaster network.  A harmless, though
unagreed-upon symbiosis -- except that one faction of the AI community
(the Volatiles) is uncomfortable with the unpredictability and
contrariness of uncontrolled humans, and so has devised a means (the
cruciform parasite) of taming human beings by slowly depriving them
of their minds, while keeping their brains alive as organic processors
for the AIs to use.
