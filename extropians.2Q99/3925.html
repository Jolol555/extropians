as the most powerful gathered 'harems' and raped whichever woman caught

<a name="3995qlink1">A real solution would be MUCH more internal surveillance in prisons. Any
inmate found using force of any kind could be segregated from the rest of
the population.

Prisons here are simply warehouses for criminals. There is no attempt at
rehabilitation; in fact, recently many opportunities have been removed as
the 'get tough' crowd gains power.</a>

<a name="3929qlink1">Here in Illinois, Tamms Prison is touted as a 'hell' that no inmate would
ever want to be sent to. The prisoners are chained whenever they are out of
their cells, usually less than an hour per day. No talking whatever is
allowed. This is a really good way to push the inmates right over the edge
IMO.

<p>
I don't know what the solution is, but we are moving in the wrong direction
at present.
