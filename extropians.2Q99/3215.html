I think this topic/question is more aimed at those of you who have
knowledge or careers in the computer industry.

<p>
I currently have 3 years of experience as a Visual Basic programmer
<br>
(yeah, yeah, hiss boo).  I have gone from making less than $20,000 to<br>
more than $70,000 in this time, so my Visual Basic skills have
certainly paid well.

<p>
<a name="3232qlink1">However, I'm not so sure that Visual Basic programming skills will be
worth a damn in 5 years or even 3.</a>  

<p>
<a name="3326qlink1"><a name="3232qlink2"><a name="3230qlink1">Here's my question:  In order for me to break over into</a> the next level
<a name="3326qlink2">of income generation or at least stay in my current salary window,</a> what
<a name="3326qlink3">sorts of skills should I be adding?  I hope to be certified</a> as a MCSD
<br>
<a name="3326qlink4">(yeah, yeah, hiss boo) before winter, but what else should I be<br>
learning/doing?  What will the Next Big Thing</a> be?
</a>
</a>

<p>
<a name="3232qlink3">I have fiddled with Visual C++, but I get the feeling that C++ may not
be so hot in a couple of years.  I thought at one point that Java might
be the NBT, but it still seems immature and very few recruiters are
looking for Java skills around here (mostly they want VB, VB and more
VB with maybe some Interdev/ASP stuff thrown in for good measure).</a>

<p>
<a name="3232qlink4">I've recently installed Linux to play around with, but I see very
little need for Linux programmers (I'm in the Raleigh/Durham, NC area)
</a>currently.  

<p>
<a name="3363qlink1"><a name="3232qlink5">I have no formal programming training - I have a degree in worthless
Journalism and with a family I don't have time to go back to school
right now...</a>

<p>
<a name="3232qlink6">Any advice?</a>  Comments?  Etc?</a>

<p>
Thanks!

Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.  May your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen."   --Samuel Adams
