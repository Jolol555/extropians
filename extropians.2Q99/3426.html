Agreed.

Agreed.

Agreed.  But this is an example of a legally-obtained gun being used in the
commission of a crime.  The study claimed that the incidence of this was
very low.  Careful reading of the study showed that they excluded stolen
guns from being counted.  Since most criminals have illegally-obtained guns,
the study excluded almost all gun crime statistics from their numbers.

I am not objecting to any specific claim of yours.  I am merely pointing out
that this study did not look at most crime numbers, but was carefully
crafted to produce the unrealistic numbers being quoted.  As I have said
before, I am not anti-gun, but I am anti-misleading-statistics.
