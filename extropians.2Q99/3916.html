I believe that the Extropians list has been around a good while longer than 
that.  I recall participating back in the early 90s.  Anybody remember to 
online pledge drive?  The list's first malicious email bomber?  Boy, those 
were, uh, . . . days.

I doubt that hanging around a long time automatically makes anyone very 
influential.  To the contrary, many old-timers, having grown weary of the 
many, many recurring debates, probably post infrequently.  Relative newbies 
thus seldom recognize the names of their listserv elders.  And, at any rate, 
I should think that Extropians accord little merit to mere seniority.
