Not at all, parents regularly now make decisions for their child's
welfare without first getting the consent of the child.

<p>
God damn this indenting makes it a total pain to reply.

Do you *really* feel that "the Dept. of Defense, DARPA, NSF, NSA, etc.
should be viewed as those who will "set us free""??  I mean, honestly? 
This strikes me as, well, ludicrous.

<p>
I would see that those organisations are extremely repressive, and it is
only  a happy accident that the technologies of control and power they
develop can be hacked to use for our own ends.  I in no way see these
organisations as contributing to the personal freedom of anyone other
than those in the US who want to obey the law.
