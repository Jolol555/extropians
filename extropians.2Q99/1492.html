Well, thanks for agreeing with me about everything else, but...

<p>
Actually, I would probably say much the same thing if I came out of the
blue and made a statement like that.  The real reason I think that "laws
are stuff" is that back when I was trying to figure out how to define
"instantiation" for conscious entities, the one thing I kept running
into was the idea that you could define any sort of consciousness apart
from the algorithms composing it - two identical algorithms, one of
which was conscious, the other wasn't; consciousness as epiphenomenon. 
I hate this idea.  Any theory in which this idea shows up is wrong.

<p>
I intuit that the same holds true of reality.  A process which is "real"
will differ materially, in results and output, from a process which is
"not real".  Now, you can have one Turing algorithm which is "real" and
one that is "not real", and they'll both work exactly the same way;
reality is an optional add-on, just a matter of instantiation.  Thus I
don't believe in the Turing formalism.  It's no small wonder that the
Turing formalism can't answer questions about instantiation, or about
the First Cause, when it treats reality as an epiphenomenon.

<p>
Special Relativity keys into that, but only vaguely.  I could be wrong -
I probably am wrong - about the blur between Turing tick and Turing data
representing the blur between the laws of physics and material.  But
it's still one of the major intuitions, perhaps *the* intuition I use to
understand ontology:  Anything real can be detected, tested for, and
modified.  That goes for the laws of physics and the presence or absence
of "reality", just like it goes for anything else.
