<p>
Yeah, to say nothing of how "these issues" (neuroscience) may potentially
enable extropian humanity to emerge. We can't know anything about "better"
or "worse" in the case of human brains because we don't know enough about
how brains work. (When scientists know enough about how brains work so that
they can identify what makes them "better" or "worse", better scientists may
wonder what kind of brain becomes a Buddha, while worse scientists may try
to build one.)

<p>
Just as we shouldn't judge books by their covers (even though everyone
does), so it makes no sense to try to determine the potential capability of
brains by looking at them, because neuroscience has not yet established
reliable correlations between specific brain structures and performance
excellence. It does, nevertheless, seem intriguing that only male brains
have attained the cognitive eminence of Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Krishna,
Christ, Lao Tzu, Socrates, Gurdjieff, et al.

<a name="0930qlink1"> Einstein's brain did (does -- they keep it in a jar) look</a> different (under
<a name="0935qlink1">the microscope) than other brains, but perhaps that has</a> to do with the way
he used it. Sort of like callouses on hard working hands.
