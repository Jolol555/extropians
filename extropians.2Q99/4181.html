Zyvex has done some work on switching mechanisms and hooks. There used to be
a movie of their switch and hook on the website, but I wasn't able to find
it when I looked.

<p>
Zyvex's main focus has been buckytubes, and they have developed the
capability to deposit metals precisely. Unfortunately, Viola Vogel's efforts
with microtubles are not completely compatible with those of Zyvex.

While they can be used in liquid, this mostly not done (yet?). Microtubles
are primarily used in aqueous environment require physiological system</a> of
support.

be interested.</a>
