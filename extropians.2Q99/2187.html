<i>&gt; &gt; There has to be a central recordkeeping resource to ascertain</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; whether or not a prospective gun purchaser is underage, mentally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; deficient and/or deranged, a spouse and/or child abuser, or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; violent criminal, as well as penalties for breaking such laws, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; enforcement of the penalties; otherwise they would be useless</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; scraps of paper.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Insta-check system is such a system. However, the FBI and ATF is using this</i><br>
<i>&gt; system to keep records like a registration system, which is against both law and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the constitution. I don't mind insta-check that much, so long as my record of</i><br>
<i>&gt; purchase gets deleted. NOTE: The feds have not prosecuted one person since the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Insta-check system was instituted for illegal attempted purchase of a firearm. Its</i><br>
<i>&gt; been working for a year now. Paper tigers, anyone?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I think that this is a disgrace and that such prosecutions should be 
swift and sure.

<a href="2061.html#2187qlink2">&gt; &gt; As far as anarchy goes, postulated that you have</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a society of people with private property in close proximity with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; limited resources, and your goal is to maximize the freedoms of all,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; then your standard is that all people who are capable of assuming</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; responsibility for the free exercise of their choices should have all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; freedoms that all others do, and in the cases of inevitable conflict,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; these should be resolved by equal and proportional compromise.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Right away, you need an executive or enforcement branch to keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bullies from illicitly imposing their wills on others, a judicial branch</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to decide what is equal and proportional in each specific case, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a legislative to both set general standards for the judiciary to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; interpret in specific cases, and to enact refinements and additions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; so that the laws may evolve with changing circumstances.  You will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nweed a core document, or constitution, which clearly enumerates</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the inalienable rights to which all citizens are to be entitled,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; including minorities, and you need to allow the people at large to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; monitor the fairness and competency of those holding the positions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; whose responsibility it is to legislate, enforce and judge, and to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; expel and replace them at will; a popular vote.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not at all. There is absolutely no reason all of these functions cannot be</i><br>
<i>&gt; satisfied under the insurance/PPA/PPL model for a libertarian/free market anarchy</i><br>
<i>&gt; society. Those that wish to live in no-right-to-carry communities can do so, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; their PPA will enforce that wish under their standard contracts. I suggest you</i><br>
<i>&gt; research this area before you baldly state that only a government can do this.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
The PPa idea has pretty thoroughly been discredited, on the 
grounds that ANY organization which assumes the functions of a 
government has a tendency to become a de facto, if not de jure, 
government and any safeguards which are built in to prevent this 
may be co-opted by the PPA and used against those whom they 
were created to protect.  To try to have a government without 
having a government is a futile exercise in self-contradiction.  Just 
admit that we need governance, and ceaselessly go about evolving 
the best feasible entity for the purpose.  I do not think we can do 
without executive, legislative, judiciary, constitution and popular 
vote, for the phenomenological reasons stated above.
