<a name="3021qlink1"><a name="2886qlink1">No, no, no. Using electrical cars has primarily one function: zero
emission, at least in situ. Properly designed electrical cars should
be lithium-cell driven composite-frame lightweight vehicles without 
a transmission (motors in the wheel hub), having a spike cache 
(e.g. a supercapacitor bank) and regen (brake energy regeneration) 
braking. These things would be environmentally clean, silent and have
very impressive driving characteristics while being impact
safe. Design studies of these have been made.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3522qlink1">A complementary infrastructure for these vehicles are ubiquitous
photovoltaics panels, allowing to recharge the batteries at home/work, 
etc -- once again, with zero emission. Thin-film nonsilicon (e.g. 
CuInSe) PV is a very viable technology once again yet to profit 
from economies of scale.</a> 

<p>
Of course the most sensible thing would be using a methanol (reformer) 
fuel cell or a hydrogen (metal hydrid/buckytube adsorber in composite
pressurized tank) for energy source. The hydrogen could come from
fossil fuel reformers or electrolysers (which can be pretty efficient
nowadays).

<p>
There are lots of sensible alternatives to the way we're usually doing 
things. Unfortunately, the general public seems to have teflon lungs
and glass eyes, and don't mind the beautiful St. Andreas mountain view 
be obscured by the veil of photosmog.

<p>
Of course these R&amp;D expenses should be better put into development of
molecular devices which could run rings around any Carnot or fuel
cells, but the point is R&amp;D resource distribution is not a zero-sum
game. We are very, very wasteful.
