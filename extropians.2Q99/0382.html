True enough.  Neo needed to believe that he was The One to the degree that he could even believe that the Oracle, who was Never Wrong, was wrong about him, before he could become The One.  This could have never happened had She told him that he was the One.  Hmmm... an inverted double-bind; interesting.

Kinda like the two monks discussing whether the flag was flapping and the wind was, to which the Master disdainfully replied, "It's your minds that are flapping!"
