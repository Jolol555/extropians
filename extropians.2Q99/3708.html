Alan Turing (name uttered in low reverent tones) proposed
<a name="3771qlink1">that true artificial intelligence has been achieved when one
can have a conversation with a human and a machine, and
the interrogator would be unable to tell which is which.</a>

<p>
It seems with last week's news that a program can generate
music in the style of Bach and Beethoven is at least the second
example of having Turing's criterion achieved.  The first example
is chess computing.  Using modern chess software, it is difficult
or impossible to determine if a game was generated by two humans,
a machine vs a human or machine vs machine.  15 years ago, one
could tell easily.  Today, no.

<p>
When that software came about, those interested in Turing
tests simply declared that chess has a straightforward algorithm,
thereby its practice does not constitute intelligence!  {8^D
We chess players didnt like that a bit.  Now the same appears
to be happening to certain types of music.

<a name="4282qlink1"><a name="3771qlink2">Please, those in the know, give me examples of areas that
were once considered the domain of carbon based computers,
that are now done by silicon, and speculate on near future
domains where the trasition is yet to occur.  spike
