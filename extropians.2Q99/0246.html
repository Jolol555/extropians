The following dialog appears when you try to load macros into Word 97.
"The document you are opening contains macros or customizations.  Some
macros may contain viruses that could harm your computer.  If you are
sure this document is from a trusted source, click Enable Macros.  If
you are not sure and want to prevent any macros from running, click
Diable Macros."  The "Disable Macros" button is highlighted by
default.
