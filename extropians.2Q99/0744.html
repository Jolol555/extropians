Of course I am nano inflicted, and I in no way attempt to diffuse 
this. I have been giving a lot of thought to the applications of 
nanotechnology. I am most eager to aquire some time of brain 
enhancment as far as my intellect goes. But I also offer this 
contemplation up for question.
<br>
What of molecularly engineering your sexual response? Sexual climax 
multiplied by? Maybe pi?(okay, maybe infinity would be too much) I 
can't help imagining what a "nanorgasim" (copyright Gina Miller) 
could be programmed to feel like.
<br>
Let me clarify that in no way is nautures reserve of adrenalin 
prompted by orgasim unsufficient to me! However one could say the 
same about one's intellect and still hope to take the unbeated path 
of extending it.
<br>
How would one go about re-configuring these genes and could we at all 
make it possible to have them layer into other aspect's that the body 
sexually doesn't usually interact with.
<br>
I mean we've all heard of fetishes,(food, feet and other 
unmentionables) could these be incorperated into the experience via 
manipulation? What would you include and would you do it?
