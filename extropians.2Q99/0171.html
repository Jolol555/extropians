<a name="0301qlink1"><a name="0197qlink1">Drexler is not a character as described. He does not go around "thumbing 
his nose" at others in the arena. As a matter of fact from some of these 
responses, I'd say it's the other way around. Does anyone here know him 
personally. He is not a downlooker.</a>
