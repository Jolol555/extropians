<a name="1632qlink1"><a name="1619qlink1">I have re-read everything I have written on this list for the past month,
and I honestly don't understand why so many of you are so upset by what I
have written.  I noticed two or three things I wrote that were meant to
be mildly offensive, but that was in response to what I viewed as extreme
and unfounded hostility towards me.  I would appreciate it if those who
have been offended by me would read over what I have written and let me
know what I did to upset them so much.  I have no wish to be offensive,
and I am quite surprised by the reaction I am getting from many of you.  

<p>
I feel that I have been unjustly accused by many on this list, and I
would appreciate a detailed explanation, based on what I have posted to
the list, of why so many are so upset at me.  I honestly don't know what
I am writing that has offended so many.</a>  

<p>
Thank you for your feedback,

<p>
