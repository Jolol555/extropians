Reading over my post, I realized my comments concerning the latter option
were misleading.  If the latter option is the case, i.e., that consciousness
is just a formal system, through sensory facilities, being able to reflect
upon itself, then consciousness is not really "impenetrable".  Instead, it
simply will defy all our attempts to develop a consistent and complete
description of it.  Hofstadter (in _GEB_ and fleshed out more in _The Mind's
I_) describes this entire concept much better than I.  Tor Norretranders
spends an entire book ruminating on the concept in _The User Illusion_.

<p>
Additionally, there is a project (based in the Netherlands I believe) that
is exploring the concept of self-reference in AI
 <a href="http://nl.ijs.si/~damjan/fs-ai.html">http://nl.ijs.si/~damjan/fs-ai.html</a> ).  A member of its team is a rather
bright fellow by the name of Damjan Bojadziev.  He has an interesting paper
entitled "Mind Versus Godel" at <a href="http://nl.ijs.si/~damjan/g-m-c.html">http://nl.ijs.si/~damjan/g-m-c.html</a>
