<a name="2263qlink1">What precisely in the movie are you referring to? The only clear incident
of technology that might have disappeared in the movie is the neato-keen
droid space fighters.</a> I couldn't see that their performance was
sufficiently worse then the human controlled fighters in Star Wars to
justify switching. All of the other technology in the movie seemed to
perform sufficiently "retro" relative to the tech in the later movies. For
example in Return of the Jedi they get the performace of those "pods" in
speeder bikes that noticeably DON'T have to have Rolls-Royce jet engines
strapped to the front :)
