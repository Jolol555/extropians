Taking this a step further, I suppose it would be possible to devise
non-lethal weapons designed to *convince* people that they had been
mortally wounded.  There have been numerous documented cases of people
acting like they had been mortally wounded when in fact they had not been
harmed.  This wouldn't work on all aggressors, but it would work for some.

<p>
I remember a couple cases where people have been unwittingly shot with
paintball guns (which have a loud report and can deliver a sharp pain when
hit), where the victim actually played the part of a seriously wounded
individual because they believed they had been shot, being unaware that the
device they had been shot with was harmless.   People have been sued for
"psychological damages" resulting from such instances, because of trauma
caused to the individual who believed they had been shot.
