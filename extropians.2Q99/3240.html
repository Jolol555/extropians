That's very true.  We used to have rules against arguing the "basics".
Basic questions like "should we have government?", "are guns bad?", "and
"does capitalism work?" were all considered "basic", and people were
encouraged to debate such questions elsewhere.  It was recognized that such
discussions would go round and round with nobody conceding on either side.
Instead, the list was limited to new ideas or new concepts.  Arguing the
validity of age-old issues was not on-topic.
