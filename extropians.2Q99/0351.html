I am happy for you that you were able to quit but, uh, how is it that you
quit cold turkey by "winding down over about 1 month"?  As for your query, I
don't have anything solid for you but it is fairly clear that certain
personality types are more prone to addictive behaviors than others and it's
reasonable to conclude that genetics plays a role in one's vulnerability.

I actually did quit cold turkey after 15 years (after multiple</a> unsuccessful
attempts, of course).  I believe that I do not have the hypothetical
"addictive personality gene".  I've indulged in a number of substances in
the past that were allegedly addictive and never had a problem quitting any
of them.  Lucky me. . .perhaps.  I also seem unable to get addicted to good
habits!
