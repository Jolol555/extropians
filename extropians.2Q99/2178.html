<i>&gt; &gt; And both removing guns from the hands of the irresponsible (violent</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; reasonable, rational and prudent life-protection measure to take.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe, I agree that keeping weapons out of the hands of convicted</i><br>
<i>&gt; felons is often a good idea. Many laws exist which purport to</i><br>
<i>&gt; support that aim, but they seem to be ineffective.  Do you have any</i><br>
<i>&gt; useful suggestions on how those laws could be enforced such that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they have some useful positive impact?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Universal background checks prior to all transfers, and enforced 
penalties for those who, knowing that they're ineligible to purchase 
(due to age, violent criminal or abuser record, or documented 
mental illness resulting in a judgment of diminished responsibility) 
guns, nevertheless attempt to circumvent these laws and acquire 
them. 
<br>

<a href="2058.html#2178qlink2">&gt; I gather the impression that, unlike many "ban the gun" advocates,</a><br>
<i>&gt; you don't mind gun ownership by non-felons, and you own weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt; yourself.  Sadly it appears that most mass shooters are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; convicted felons *at the time they commit their attacks*, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; banning the possession of guns by _potential_ shooters would require</i><br>
<i>&gt; massive infringements of civil rights- for who can identify a</i><br>
<i>&gt; potential shooter?  Psychological screening for firearms purchases? </i><br>
<i>&gt; The possibilities for political abuse of such a system would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; large.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
But not impossible to guard against.  I assume that any remotely 
contestable judgment would be fought tooth and nail by the NRA; 
maybe this is an advocacy role they could play in the future - admit 
that some sort of screening system, which still allows the vast 
majority to own guns if they so choose, is necessary for the public 
good, and labor to keep it honest.
