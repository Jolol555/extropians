I have ingested caffeine, mainly in the form of coffee and soft drinks,
<a name="0328qlink1">since before start of recorded personal memory.  A relatively short time
ago I read about the caffeine withdrawal symptoms and I decided to try
to experience and recognize them.  I therefore ended caffeine consumption,
and experienced two weeks of horror and misery. After these two weeks the
mental iron curtain rised.  I note much lower stress levels, and generally
an increased intellectual and memory functionality.  Much less information
overload now.
