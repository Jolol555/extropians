<p>
Okay.  So it is trivial for people to earn the money required to provide
their basic needs.  I'll agree with this.

<p>
Wait just a minute.  "...and they can be provided by others for free."

<p>
Who is "they"?  So I have to earn $1200 a month, $600 for my "basic needs"
and $600 for someone else's basic needs?  How is this supposed to work?
Thanks, but no thanks; I'd just as soon sit around the house and have my
"basic needs" provided for free.  Same benefits, but a lot less work.
"Free" as in "free beer" is an invalid economic construct anyway.

<p>
If earning the money required for a persons basic needs is so trivial, then
I can't fathom why anyone else should be allowed to take the money I earn.
Additionally, if the number of people who can't provide for themselves is
so small, I would expect that charity and altruism would pick up the slack
more than adequately.  

<p>
How does your idea fit into the real world?  Can you resolve the disparity
between the number of people who can't provide their own basic needs and
the number of people who *choose* not to?  This disparity is the downfall
of most forms of socialism.
