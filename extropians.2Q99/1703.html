Actually I agree with you to a certain extent, and I would go further by
saying I also think its possible to be completely rational and also insane.
It all depends on how we are defining the terms.  Despite Hanibal Lecter's
fictional status, it could be argued that the he is not sane, but very
capable of rational thought.

<p>
I would argue that a person who makes better decisions than another is more
sane.  In the context of my previous post, I'm attempting to develop a
definition of sanity that's determined as much by a persons emotional
well-being, as it is on rational thought and action.

<p>
Like any tool, E-prime has its niche.  I personally find it quite useful in
clarifying my perception of the relativity of subjective experience.

<p>
I agree with you completely here.  Sorry if my post led you to believe
otherwise.
