Hmm, perhaps you would benefit from a logic course (teaching of which is
one of the things that occupies my time, along with other classes). Not
only am I not finding time to post here very often, I'm more limited in
replying to email in general and have hardly read any books in months.

<p>
As Mike and others noted, there will be numerous reasons why previous List
participants may be quiet. Some of us are just extremely busy. My work week
consists of about 80 hours currently. Some have probably gained what they
wanted from the List termporarily or long-term and are occupied elsewhere.
Do you really expect all the same people to keep posting consistantly over
the seven years of the List's lifetime so far?

example, Perry Metzger--who first started this list and was one of the most
prolific posters on the entire internet at tha time, is busy these days
running a business.</a>

Email list can be quite addictive. I think there are some people here who
would probably have better lives if they eased off a bit on posting and
focused more on major life goals. Some will have the free time to indulge
harmlessly, but others may benefit by revolving less around the list.

<p>
Got to go -- I have a conference to organize and classes to prepare.  :-)
