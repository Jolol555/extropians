OK, I understand this.  That lasers have recoil I did not know.

<i>&gt; As an interesting note, you CAN get thrust by simply firing the laser out</i><br>

<p>
Correct, I have also heard of this.  Another old idea is to use a ground-based
laser to shoot up projectiles into orbit.

<p>
The idea of shooting a laser for thrust is still an interesting one.  This would
appear to require no reaction mass, only power, as opposed to minimal reaction
mass, using ions.  So, lasers can be the source of reaction propulsion with no
reaction mass propellants.

<p>
In terms of usable long range thrust capabilities, it would appear that a
Bussard ramjet might be more efficient, ie, using a magnetic scoop to funnel
interstellar hydrogen into the the reaction chamber for ion propellant,
collecting the nearly zero reaction mass available along the way.

<p>
It would seem likely that before we developed any interstellar travel mechanism
using conventional slower than light travel, there will be some advances that
allow dimensional travel, but that is beyond the realm of conventional science.
These things are much "easier said than done."
