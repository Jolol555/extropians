<a name="4272qlink1"><a href="4267.html#4268qlink1">&gt; I see no part of this scenario that makes me feel</a> that the dismantled brain</a><br>
<a name="4272qlink2"><i>&gt; is any more alive than any other dead brain.  Basically, people are</i><br>
<i>&gt; pretending that the dead brain is still alive, and they have divided</a> up that</i><br>
<a name="4272qlink3"><i>&gt; dead brain's functions among a lot of people, each who do</a> the function for</i><br>
<a name="4272qlink4"><i>&gt; the dead brain and give the dead brain credit.  Put all these things</i><br>
<i>&gt; together, and it looks like the dead brain is really functioning.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4271qlink1">So to continue this thought experiment,</a> suppose that after your
roomful of living engineers have used their memories of the oncelive
 brain to contruct a robot ("dead brain") that exhibits all
its apparently conscious behaviors, after which a virus wipes
them all out.  Are those apparently conscious behaviors of the
surviving robot going to go away, or do they no longer qualify
as conscious simply because no conscious-by-definition human is
around to judge?</a>  Suppose that robot then uses its knowledge to
<a name="4271qlink2">construct a human genome from recordings, mechanically generates
DNA from it, implants it into a cow egg and grows a new human.
Where, then, does that person's consciousness come from, if it is
not simply a consequence of the biochemical activity of the meat
machine?</a>
