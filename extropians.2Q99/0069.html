<a name="0215qlink1"><a name="0075qlink1">The reason you saw a notice from me regarding the THAAD
failure on Thursday afternoon when I actually posted it Monday
<a name="0234qlink1">morning (an hour after the event) was that our computers were
melissa-ed and the network was down all week.</a>

<p>
<a name="0215qlink2">CNN reports they nabbed the dirty scoundrel who wrote the
virus.  I cheered.  For about three seconds.  Then I said: wait
</a>
a minute.  What charge?  Is this not covered under the US
first amendment granting free speech?  If he is charged</a> with
<a name="0215qlink3">obstructing public communications, should not Microsloth
be named as a co-conspirator?  Should not this perp and
Bill Gates share a cell?  Could not Microsloth have shipped
their product so that macros were disabled until *specifically
enabled* by the 2% of the populace that will ever actually
read the manual and decide we *need* word macros?</a>  How
many of you among the writhing amoeba of extropianism
have ever actually used a MS word macro?  More than
once?</a>

<p>
<a name="0215qlink4"><a name="0075qlink2">Legal eagles, help me out here: is the melissa author in real
danger of going to the slammer?  I am tempted to defend</a> the
<a name="0215qlink5">unsavory character.  He did us all a service by pointing out
yet another bug in Microsloth word.  spike
