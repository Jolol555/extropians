<a name="4569qlink1">I also find that I'm spending too much time thinking about it - but for
me anything above zero would be "too much", considering my old statement
that "When I want to reproduce I'll clone myself or build an AI."  I've
heard that the average male thinks about sex every 34 seconds, according
to the only statistic I've heard on the subject, from some forgotten
source.  Well, I'm way, way below that; presently down to something on
the order of every 3.4 hours.  And I'm presently 19, and had 34-minute
<a name="4582qlink1">discipline from around the beginning of puberty, which probably makes it
more impressive.</a></a>

I find that the two best strategies, are, first, to be able to view
yourself in terms of evolutionary psychology and neurophysiology,
translating emotions into evolutionary strategies, testosterone, and
"small explosions of endogenous opiates", as I believe someone on the
list said.  And, second, to bear in mind the cosmic moral insignificance
of both abstinence and indulgence - from what I've heard, not that I'd
know, feeling guilty doesn't help at all.

<p>
Drugs... I wouldn't know.  I think I'll have to second the
recommendation Not To Tamper With It; it's too central.  Even a software
solution is playing it close.
