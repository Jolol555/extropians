<p>
I think you are mixing up things here a bit. The quantum teleportation
(which has been demonstrated in a scientifically satisfying way,
unlike cold fusion) moves the *quantum state* of one particle to
another particle (by using an intermediary). It doesn't mean particle
A escapes spacetime to appear at location B or something like
that. Energy transfer using this will be just energy transfer. And I
don't see how mass-energy conversion get into it.

<a name="0735qlink2"><a href="0729.html#0734qlink2">&gt; Theoretically, no matter where in space-time, there is an infinite</a><br>
<i>&gt; number of higher dimensions.  So, at an arbitrary coordinate of</i><br>
<i>&gt; (0,0,0), at arbitrary time 0, there is a fifth dimension ranging</i><br>
<i>&gt; from -oo to oo, where oo is scalar infinity, and that coordinate in</i><br>
<i>&gt; space-time might be at any coordinate in the fifth</i><br>
<i>&gt; dimension. etcetera.  This could mean that there are an infinite</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of alternate space-times for each point in space-time.</i><br>

<p>
Again, you seem to be mixing up "theoretically possible" with
"real". Sure, there might be extra dimensions (M-brane theory is
filled with them, although they are "curled up" and run from 0 to 2pi
instead of -infinity to infinity), but you can't just assume that
there are arbitrary extra dimensions and then make claims</a> that

<a name="0735qlink3"><a href="0729.html#0734qlink3">&gt; Once this system is better defined, and we have developed tools to</a><br>
<i>&gt; interact with and work with it, then a large variety of "special</i><br>
<i>&gt; effects" will be able to be tapped.</i><br>

<p>
Note that you have drifted from a "may" to a "will". This is very
dangerous; we may understand how aging works within a few years, but
if I go around claiming that we will become immortal by 2010 without
having any support for my view then I will not only appear a bit
crackpotish to people, but also draw ridicule on much legitimate life
extension research and immortalism. If I have some evidence or a good
argument, then things change.
