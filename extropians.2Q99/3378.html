Even if your only use for a gun is defense, it makes sense to be able to
use it effectively - hence target shooting. Because I practice
periodically, I am sure of hitting what I aim at.

<p>
If the real concern is 'death at a distance', we must immediately ban</a> all
rifles and long barrel shotguns. Handguns are only accruate enough to hit a
person within 25 feet in many people's hands. Any good full choke shotgun
can kill at 50 yards. Rifles can kill at over a mile, with a good scope and
steady aim.

<p>
I have had exactly one opportunity to even have a gun in my hand in
anticipation of use against another person, in over twenty-five years of
ownership. A drunk was battering my door at 2 AM in the middle of winter. I
called the police - he was escorted to a nice warm cell to sleep it off - I
never even needed to put my finger on the trigger.

<a name="3498qlink1">If this individual had suceeded in gaining entry, though, I would have been
able to either hold him off or disable him if necessary, to defend my
family. If I had not had the gun, my only option would have been
hand-to-hand combat with someone possibly much stronger than myself. 

<p>
I will keep my weapon just in case.
