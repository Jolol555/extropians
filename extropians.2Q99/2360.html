<p>
	true, i think crocker, lorray &amp; co. would say that "no weapon 
legislation is a good amount of weapon legislation", but... whats feasible 
here? whats the goal of this? are we discussing the best way to set up a 
future society, or are we discussing the best way to modify our present ones?
<p>
	it seems to me that the discussion has gone off on a nifty spiraling 
idealogical tanget, which, while perhaps important and interisting for some, 
is easily be described for many more as a waste of bandwith...
<p>
	so what was the scope/scale/point of this whole mess, anyway? there 
have been lots of answers offered, but even by checking the archives im 
unable to determine the question. ::shrug:: or the whole debate can be called 
a dead horse, and we can all stop kicking it. im content either way. the only 
outcome i would not be diggin is for this incredibly diverse and interisting 
list to die the slow cancerous death that 'gene seems to be warning us 
about...
