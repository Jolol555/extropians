<a name="3471qlink1">Right.  Same reason we don't have unflattering horoscopes that say</a> things
like:

<p>
LIBRA - An ill-tempered snob, you're just as likely to stab your best friend
in the back as your are to sleep with someone without telling him/her you
have herpes.  People avoid conversing with you more out of indifference than
repugnance.  Your indecisiveness impairs your ability to function in the
world and makes you insufferably insecure.  Consequently, the chances are
slim that you'll ever be vocationally or socially successful.

<p>
Your horoscope today:  Prepare for a particularly bad day.  The planets are
aligned against you, even more so than usual.  Whatever you do, avoid being
seen by your employer today.  S/he's got it in for you.

<p>
Who wants to do the other signs?
