<p>
Good idea. I have found that getting to learn the basics of many areas
at an early age is a big advantage. My main problem was that it was
too fun to get lost in the higher levels of the subject, making my
practically useful basic knowledge a bit spotty, but your approach
seems rather through. Good luck with it!

<p>
&gt; On the physics side I'm starting with Feynman's lecture <br>
&gt; series. <br>

<p>
A good idea. A very good series.

<p>
<a name="1372qlink2"><a href="1232.html#1263qlink2">&gt; If anyone has any recommendations for good introductions to </a><br>

<p>
I wonder if Misner, Thorne, Wheeler _Gravitation_ is worth reading for
you. I like it and it is a standard book, but some may have different
opinions and I'm not sure about the intro potential. Anyway, it is
likely not worth reading until you have the basic physics clear.</a>

<p>
<a name="1372qlink3"><a href="1232.html#1263qlink3">&gt; I'm also interested in sharpening my programming skills which have been </a><br>

<i>&gt; lots of options and my teachers and friends have no ideas about where to </i><br>
<i>&gt; start.</i><br>

<p>
Like the others, I think C is worth knowing. Pascal - well, it is good
for you, but in my opinion it tastes bad :-) Once you understand C, I
would suggest going directly to Java, C++ is in my opinion a bit too
messy.</a>

<p>
I would like to mention Lisp and its successors like Scheme. Fairly
simple to learn, a very different approach to programming (functional
instead of imperative) and maybe a good complement to C in maturing as
a coding deity. 

<p>
I learned programming by writing a lot of basic and making all the
mistakes; it was nice to see that more modern languages had found ways
(functions, scoping, object oriented programming) that solved them but
I knew I had roughly had the same ideas on my own (just been unable to
do them in basic). Programming skill is really about programming a
lot, making mistakes, learning to discover them and gradually learn
how to write code so that they don't occur.

<p>
Any interest in neuroscience? In that case I can recommend Kalat's
_Biological Psychology_

<p>
And do read science fiction.
