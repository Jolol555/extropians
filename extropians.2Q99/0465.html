I think he missed your point - you were referring to the quality
of reality that VR will eventually achieve, he is talking about
how VR was used in the movie.

<p>
 used
<br>
<a href="0461.html#0465qlink2">&gt; for role playing in VR chat, and the trend in video games is that VR</a><br>
<i>&gt; will be the state of the art in video games, and role playing is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; form of long duration gaming of choice.</i><br>

<p>
Definitely. One of the hottest games out right now is Everquest.
A "massively multiplayer" RPG. It's advertising slogan is:
"You're in our world now"

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="0461.html#0465qlink3">&gt; As for the amnesia part, well, think about this: Take an 8 year old kid</a><br>
<i>&gt; and stick him on a VR system for his education and entertainment, heck</i><br>
<i>&gt; even for use for his physical fitness training, and by the time he's 18</i><br>
<i>&gt; he won't know what is really reality. Real reality will seem blase,</i><br>
<i>&gt; generic, vanilla compared to VR.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Really, instead of role-playing, VR will mostly be used to fascilitate</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other goals.  Shopping, travel, social gatherings, sales meetings, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; All where people know what year it is and aren't pretending otherwise.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Worlds will be chosen to fascilitate these processes.  Physical laws</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can easily be broken, but deviations would be limited by our vast</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cognitive investment in dealing the familiar laws.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Robin, you're acting WAY too grown up for this.... "SALES MEETINGS!" for</i><br>
<i>&gt; gawds sakes!!!!! eeewwwwwww......</i><br>

<p>
If only Robin were right... then we might actually have something
so cool as the matrix described by William Gibson. But so far
business hasn't really found any good uses for VR. I don't do
any programming in VR. My dad doesn't have any sales meetings in
VR - he finds that teleconferencing is fine... I actually spent
a few months a couple of years back working on a cyberspace
system, but ended up scrapping it because I really couldn't see
people using it.
