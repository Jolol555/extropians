Yep, I would too, I think, though I've never actually had cancer, so I
can't say for sure.

<p>
But my point is, that you haven't done it yet. Really, one should, in
case of sudden accident, so that someone can scrape you up, pop you in
the fridge, and the cryonics people can haul you off in good time, ready
for the future. We'd all kick ourselves if we hadn't (except we'd be
dead). But still I'm not signed up, and you're not signed up.

<p>
Yet I suspect that some list members actually are signed up. That's
excellently proactive, and you'll probably be laughing at the rest of
us. 

<p>
Just one tip - apparently you should take a big coat and maybe a space
heater in with you, because its really cold in there.

<p>
Me, well, the flames keep me warm.
