<i>&gt; the extropian viewpoint on the aesthetics of evolved art. Some people I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have talked to have a problem with me calling my evolved images 'art'. I</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3666qlink1">The problem here is likely how you define art, and that is of course messy. 

<p>
<a name="3672qlink1"><a name="3656qlink1"><a href="3490.html#3645qlink2">&gt; The hundreds of choices a person makes at each step leads to a very</a><br>
<i>&gt; expressive image of that persons' cumulative choices. Give two people the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same seed images and their end results will be completely different.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It also takes some skill to evolve really good images. Some people just</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't seem to get the hang of it. Since these images are generated by</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual expression and intention, and requires an element of skill,</a> AND</i><br>
<a name="3666qlink2"><i>&gt; are often damned pretty, why would it not be art?</i><br>
</a>

<p>
<a name="3672qlink2"><a name="3655qlink1">Exactly. I would say art (as opposed to "just" beauty) comes from the
application of a selective process (not necessarily by humans, but at
least by some kind of thinking system). Of course, evolutionary art is
<a name="3805qlink1">in many ways the purest for of art in that respect since it relies on
minimal control and only works by selection</a></a></a> :-)

<p>
<a name="3656qlink2">One complaint against much electronic art I have heard is that it
doesn't relate to the human. I don't see that as a problem since I
think there can be great art relating to non/trans/posthuman stuff. It
is just that humans can more easily relate to human stuff (but that is
just bias, of course).</a></a>
