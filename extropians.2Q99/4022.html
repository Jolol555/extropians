I was mostly a lurker back then, but I had enough foresight to archive all
of those wonderful posts.  The Eudora email client I was using at the time
had a function that allowed you to mark each post with one of five
possible gradings.  I remember weeks at a time when I gave almost every
post the highest grade.  At times I remember wondering to myself - why am
I even bothering to grade these things if there all going to be A's. 
There was a feeling that the words being passed back and forth were
somehow making history.  The money I spent when it was a pay list was well
worth it.  As soon as I started posting, the list went downhill :-)

<p>
A great thing for someone else who had these archives and enough available
time would be to select exceptional posts and find the original poster for
permission to re-post to the current public Extropians list.  I don't see
myself as having enough time to do this any time soon.
