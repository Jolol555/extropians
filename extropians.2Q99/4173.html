Anders Sandberg wisely cautions us against wallowing in nostalgia, writing:

<p>
<a href="4142.html#4173qlink1">&gt;  Hmm, just a memetic thing. Maybe we should stop complaining about the</a><br>
<i>&gt;  lost golden age and instead focus on the coming golden age of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  extropians list?</i><br>

<p>
Nostalgia can better our future, I suppose, if it encourages us review 
history for practices that we can implement now.  But anyone who grieves for 
a "lost golden age" of the Extropians list had better double-check their 
facts.

<p>
The Extropians list in the early 90s had--*suprise!*--many of the problems 
that plague the current list.  It had, for instance, a bad infection of 
argumentative and poorly-informed subscribers.  Such problems impelled ExI to 
set up a list governance process and resulted in the expulsion of at least 
one subscriber--who thereafter apparently re-subscribed under various 
pseudonyms so as to continue hogging bandwidth with irrelevant personal 
screeds.  The relative scarcity of bandwidth made such ignorant flaming all 
the more irritating.

<p>
There were, of course, a good many intelligent, well-informed, civil, and 
literate subscribers.  But the current list has a good many of those, too.  
Did the list formerly host "bigger names?  Probably not.  Many of those folks 
were not yet well-known outside of our tight little circle.  (I daresay that 
ExI can boast having made their radical work more acceptable to the greater 
public.)  Furthermore, many other former subscribers, whose names never 
surface in our comparisons of present and future lists, never rose to stardom.

<p>
I am not counselling inaction in the face of current problems.  As I noted, 
we took action in the past when faced with S/N problems.  I mean merely to 
caution against ancestor worship.  We have brains and backbone enough right 
here and now to tackle the current problems of the Extropians list.
