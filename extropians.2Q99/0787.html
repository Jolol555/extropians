<a href="0557.html#0787qlink1">&gt; Which brings me to the topic of a different thread, the question of `soul'.</a><br>
<i>&gt;  It seems to me that science is good at providing satisfactory solutions</i><br>
<i>&gt; only to questions that can be well-framed, questions for which we can hope</i><br>
<i>&gt; to find an answer.  Its starting point might be the one I. I. Rabi blurted</i><br>
<i>&gt; out when he learned of the meson: `Who ordered that?'  That is: what's the</i><br>
<i>&gt; role this phenomenon plays in the wider scheme of things known to us from</i><br>
<i>&gt; all our joint efforts to know and comprehend the world?  So: Who ordered</i><br>
<i>&gt; the soul?  People who were puzzled by the gap between brute, unliving</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter and complex living critters, and by the gap between brute matter and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rich inward qualia of consciousness.</i><br>

<p>
I think this fits the facts. Lee Smolin mentioned something similar in
_The Life of the Cosmos_, where he pointed out that Newtonian
mechanics couldn't explain life and other complex systems
satisfactory, so people invented vitalism.

<p>
I wonder if we humans are excessively anthropomorphizing things? We
have well developed social interaction subsystems of our brains, and
using them to think about complex phenomena might have been a
convenient mental shortcut (handle animals as if they had human
properties, and you could more easily learn to hunt or use them; the
same goes for plants and the weather). So we have brains that tend to
imbue just about everything with a human-like appearance. This might
be another reason people believe in souls: they anthropomorphize a lot
of their aspects (shadow, breath, thinking), and this easily become
something apparently independent (Yes, I was reading Frazer's _Golden
Bough_ over breakfast :-)

<p>
<a href="0557.html#0787qlink2">&gt; But increasingly, the public investigative methods</a><br>
<i>&gt; of the sciences *are* approaching an adequate account of how mind is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; brained body in action.  We can't yet explain the allure of the Mona Lisa</i><br>
<i>&gt; (I'd bet learnig to copy the avowed responses of others has a lot to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; with it), but cognitive science and evolutionary psychology offer a better</i><br>
<i>&gt; chance of a good account than gesturing at a supposed `soul' that has no</i><br>
<i>&gt; limits or characteristics distinguishing it from its absence.</i><br>

<p>
Exactly.
