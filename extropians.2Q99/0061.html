<a name="0100qlink1"><a name="0083qlink1">Amazingly enough, researchers have yet to measure a significant</a> aggregate 
effect of medicine (doctors, etc.) on health.</a>

<p>
<a name="0100qlink2">Sure there are lots of clinical studies purporting to show the benefits</a> of 
various treatments.  But clinical trials tend to study best practice on 
patients mostly likely to benefit. Negative results tend not to be 
published, and the vast majority of medical practice has yet to be studied 
with clinical trials.

<p>
<a name="0083qlink2">The studies that have looked at the aggregate health effect of medicine as 
typically practiced, averaging over all the things doctors do, have no 
found a significant effect.<a name="0076qlink1">  Two decades ago ~$50 million was spent on a 
</a>
randomized trial among 5000 people over 2-3 years, some of which got 1/3 
more medical care than the rest.  The only differences found were corrected 
vision via glasses, more filled teeth cavities, and lowered blood pressure 
among the poor (which may be a placebo effect).</a>  A recent analysis of 5 
<a name="0076qlink2">million Medicare patients, using regional spending variations of a factor 
of two (controlling for lots of stuff), found that any mortality benefit of 
spending in the last six months of life is less than a one part</a> in a 
thousand.

<p>
Is this all from anal statisticians imposing too high a standard of 
evidence?  Consider that by these same standards we *have* seen significant 
robust effects of age, exercise, fat, smoking, and social status on health. 
(Exercise and social status reduce mortality by roughly a factor of three 
each.)

<p>
How could medicine not be healthy?  Surgery clearly has negative effects on 
the body, drugs upset evolved balances, and hospitals are clearly great 
places to spread contagious diseases.  It is widely accepted that centuries 
ago doctors did many harmful things like bleeding folks along with a few 
useful things they did, and that the net effect may not have been positive. 
The same may be true today.

<p>
Of course most of this data is about the "second half" of the money we 
spend on medical care.  Maybe we get more health value for the first half 
of spending.  Or maybe not.

<p>
<a name="0100qlink3">The apparent low health value of medical care is all the more</a> striking 
given that we spend 14% of GDP on it in the U.S.<a name="0083qlink3">  And it must surely give 
pause to those who hope that medicine will soon give us dramatically 
expanded life spans.</a>
