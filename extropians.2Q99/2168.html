<a href="2065.html#2168qlink1">&gt; &gt; The interesting thing for me is how, for some people, issues like</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; this become religious, by which I mean a person will take a conclusion</i><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt; &gt; (however arrived at) and keep it safe from any evidence or reasoning</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that would tend to discredit it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is an interesting cognitive malfunction, present in many, including</i><br>
<i>&gt; creationists, legislators, and poker players.  Humans tend to believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; what they would like to believe, regardless of the evidence.  Some can</i><br>
<i>&gt; even know what the rational conclusion is and /still/ cling to what</i><br>
<i>&gt; they want to believe.  There are many trained doctors who tout worthless</i><br>
<i>&gt; herbs or homepathic crap despite years of education in how to properly</i><br>
<i>&gt; evaluate a drug.  Many a poker player can tell you that ey is precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt; an 11-to-1 underdog to fill that straight, but ey will call the bet</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway because of a hunch ("I can feel it coming").  I paid my rent by</i><br>
<i>&gt; exploiting them, and they kept coming back to the table despite the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mounds of cash they spent chasing those hunches. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dawkins makes an interesting argument that credulity is an advantage</i><br>
<i>&gt; for children, and to some extent it may have been for adults as well</i><br>
<i>&gt; during most of our evolutionary history.  I haven't found a cure yet,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but I have seem people make the transition so I know it can be done.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I wonder how you would go about measuring it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Knowing that this is the case with you, it seems that you would 
somehow be able to deprogram yourself, but I guess a True Gun 
Believer, just like a True Antiabortionist, would never want to...
