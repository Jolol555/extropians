<p>
In an earlier post I suggested that flamewars might, among other positive 
side-effects, encourage the development of increasingly effective rhetorical 
tools.  More recently, various posts have discussed whether responding to 
anti-gun messages changes any minds.  In regard to both notions, allow me to 
share some comments of Benjamin Franklin.

<p>
In his autobiography, Franklin relates that he enjoyed sharp argumentation in 
his youth and won a reputation--a justified but not favorable one--for 
stirring up trouble.  He reflected, as he matured, that while fellow 
travelers often admired his rhetoric and awarded him points for demolishing 
their common opponents, he never seemed to change anyone's opinion on the 
merits of their disputes.  Instead, Franklin discovered, his chastened 
adversaries merely retreated in anger to find new (and seldom better) 
justifications for their views or merely to repeat more heatedly what they 
had already asserted in vain.

<p>
That Franklin found it easy to attribute such reactions to human pride and 
irrationality soothed him, but still left him with empty victories.  Franklin 
thus resolved to find more convincing rhetorical tools, ones that would both 
root out error *and* encourage the adoption of more correct views.

<p>
Franklin furthermore discovered, as he matured, that he had in many cases 
embraced false tenets.  He began to espouse a philosophy quite akin (I 
daresay) to the pancritical rationalism that Max More has ably described.  
Thus Franklin resolved to always preface his claims with, "It seems to me 
that," "Evidence suggests that," "One might reasonably assume that," and so 
forth.  This, he found, not only proved more honest and accurate, but also 
proved more apt to gently sway his listeners.<a name="2934qlink1">  He even organized a 
wonderfully successful debate and discussion society--the listserv of his 
day, I suppose--around such principles of rhetoric.</a>

<p>
Franklin's autobiography includes a great many other useful and entertaining 
observations about rhetoric, practical ethics, and human nature.  I 
wholeheartedly suggest it to transhumanists of all stripes.
