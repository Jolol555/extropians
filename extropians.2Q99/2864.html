(The bulk of this message is intended for everyone, not just Joe)<br>

<p>
Thank very much, Joe, for your re-cap of my rif, and your comments.  I was 
typing so fast that I grammatically/logically screwed up alot of it.  E.G.:  
"2a" should read something to the effect that it is COUNTERINTUITIVE  that 
an obviously deranged, insane, psychotic (whatever...) person should not be 
PROHIBITED/PROSCRIBED from obtaining/possessing/using a deadly weapon.  But 
Joe and most or all the rest of y'all, obviously "got" it as written anyway; 
but I do apologize for the bass-ackward incoherent screw-up!  And, Joe, your 
added comments were right-on.  THANKS again!  So what's the controversy, 
then?  With suitable Deesian modifications and protocols, I would seem 
nonetheless to side with Mike, Brian, and, if I've understood his 
contributions correctly, Mark Unicorn (though sometimes his stuff seemed a 
bit inconsistent--BUT that may well have been my own 
MISreading/MISinterpretation due to reading to damn fast and cursorily)  
<br>
(same goes for Billy Brown's stuff on guns, etc.)  The point is, surely <br>
competent persons (adults--but I'd say even 18-yr. olds and maybe even take 
it down to, say, 16 or even 15---this is admittedly yet another 
"gray"/problematic (sub)area) have a (natural, not merely "conventional") 
RIGHT to, as it were, pack heat, if they damn well desire to do so.  I 
happen, interestingly enough, to NOT (yet, anyway) own a firearm--yet I'm 
nonetheless a strong supporter of a rather robust (interpretation of the) 
2nd Amendment.

<p>
It's a conservative/libertarian cliche--and yet TRUE:  If guns are outlawed, 
only outlaws (and Der STAT) will have guns--and then heaven help us!  (And 
I'm NOT at all a conservative, by the way---I vacillate between (a slightly 
"leftist") anarcho-capitalist and libertarian anarcho-communist!)

<p>
But if we culturally and (meta)jurisprudentially emphasize and concentrate 
on ***DEFENSE***, then I think the prospects are pretty good that we can 
<br>
(eventually) have (evolved) as a standard (i.e., "default") <br>
macro-environmental protocol the kind of macro-level u-fog (or whatever) 
"active shield" (of a sort) that is programmed to disallow the initiation of 
AGGRESSION against another person or their "property" (I use scare-quotes 
just now because I don't want, at this time, to take up (jump into) the 
whole "rif" raff (as is were!!) on property, property rights, copyrights, 
etc., which, admittedly, needs alot of work/clarification/elucidation).  
This is, of course, presuming that we SURVIVE and flourish, instead of 
getting snuffed out on the way to nano-Eutopia.

<p>
Also, one should note that the above alluded-to macro-level active shield 
protocol could certainly be modified/turned(temporarily)-off so as to allow 
for people into "Medieval-Times-for-REAL" (so to speak) and/or some sort of 
"ULTIMATE-Ultimate-Fighting-Challenge"  or "Conan-the Barbarian-for-REAL" 
<br>
(you get the point), can punch, kick, choke, stab, chop, garrotte, and shoot <br>
the hell outta each other (presumably to be "put back together again" by 
advanced nanotech).  (Ettinger briefly discusses something very similar in 
his book, MAN INTO SUPERMAN, as many or most of you are probably familiar 
with.)

<p>
One last bibliographic rif:  If you haven't already, please check out 
Richard Epstein's stuff (especially TAKINGS, SIMPLE RULES FOR A COMPLEX 
SOCIETY, and PRINCIPLES OF A FREE SOCIETY)  **and** Randy Barnett's great 
new work, THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY.  As I'm sure Tom (Morrow, that is) would 
agree, these are very good works to start with to kick off one's own 
ruminations on (meta)jurisprudence and (meta) political philosophy.  (And, 
of course, it's also good to check out Hayek, Lon Fuller, Roscoe Pound, and 
Oliver W. Holmes too, just as further background).  Also, for 
moral-psychological background to social philosophy in general, I highly 
recommend Loren Lomasky's PERSONS, RIGHTS, AND THE MORAL COMMUNITY, and the 
<br>
(LAMENTABLY!!!) late David L. Norton's magnificent masterpiece, PERSONAL <br>
DESTINIES: A PHILOSOPHY OF ETHICAL INDIVIDUALISM.

<p>
Best regards always to one and all,

<p>
P.S. I'm NOT trying to keep the "gun-thing", so to speak, going, much less 
bash the hell out of a comatose equus, but if any do feel that the 
position(s) taken herein is(are) somehow flawed/dangerous/stupid or 
whatever, then PLEASE, please, send me your thoughts/critiques---this is 
serious stuff, because the meta-level principles involved are also involved 
in nano-weapons issues, ruminations, etc., so it does help to dialogue on 
this stuff, I think.  (But no "flamewar" diatribes, please!)
