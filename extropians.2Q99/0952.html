super-strong 
<br>
<a href="0946.html#0952qlink4">&gt;  encryption could protect the data flow from hacking attack, </a><br>

<p>
	i could easily imagine the c^3 centers that control all this being 
targets of the highest value... so i could see something like joint 
STARS/AWACS being better suited (then ground bases) to the c^3 role if only 
cuz of mobility. its a lot harder to hijack an AWACS type system then it is 
to just walk in the front door of a ground base... and enemy takeover of your 
assets would be the ultimate worstcase, right?
<p>
	aircraft can be hardened (cept for radios), right? and anyway, if 
anyone ever gets the hang of optical computing, the need for hardening would 
go down a lot... 	speaking of which, whats the current state of optical 
computing? got any good addys for me to mull?

<p>
&gt;  but EMP weapons <br>
<a href="0946.html#0952qlink5">&gt;  might well become extremely important for the defense against RCCVs.  One </a><br>
can 
<br>
<a href="0946.html#0952qlink6">&gt;  imagine cryogenically-supported, superconducting capacitor EMP bombs being </a><br>
<i>&gt;  delivered aerially or with artillery, or even in the form of land mines.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Internal automation could be hardened against EMP attack through the use </i><br>
of 
<br>
<a href="0946.html#0952qlink7">&gt;  photonics, but what of radio?  Line-of-sight microwave and laser would be </a><br>
<i>&gt;  very important in such a battlefield, perhaps supported by a LEO direct </i><br>
laser 
<br>
<a href="0946.html#0952qlink8">&gt;  network, supplemented by close-support ROV aerial laser nodes.  </a><br>

<p>
	i was reading somewhere a while ago (yea, i know, no refs; sorry =/ ) 
about a replacement for chaff (and a lotta other things). it was called 
metallifog or somethin along those lines.  i think it was some aluminium 
based compound, but it had the charactistic of being almost as light as 
air... almost. so, it fell veeeerrrrrry slowly...
<p>
	i guess this stuff was supposed to be spread as a very fine 
powder/fog over a large area with airburst-type arty (with drastic ecological 
effects, i suspect =/ ), which would make radar basicly nonfunctional, with 
the added "benefit" of not allowing anyone in the burst zone to breathe.
<p>
	the trick was that this stuff was practically impermiable with 
respect to microwave and optical transmissions.  nothing got thru.  wouldnt 
this really fuck with any attempts at large scale RCCV warfare?

<p>
<a href="0946.html#0952qlink9">&gt;  With </a><br>
<i>&gt;  sufficient miniaturization and hardening against acceleration damage, </i><br>
<i>&gt;  perhaps an RCCV force could even be supported by laser-node artillery </i><br>
shells, 
<br>
<a href="0946.html#0952qlink10">&gt;  barraged continually over a battlefront, but we're talking FAST switching </a><br>
<i>&gt;  and  HIGH network architecture flexibility here . . .</i><br>

<p>
	shit. i hesitate to contemplate the complexity involved here. 
::contemplates the complexity::  ::KABOOM dripdrip drip drip :: yes, that was 
my head.
<p>
	but if were assuming the tech to make laser node arty shells, wouldnt 
it be safe to assume laser tech capable of swatting any incoming arty shells, 
node or otherwise? and if that level laser tech exists, all kindsa other 
interisting varibles enter into this little equation, i think...?
