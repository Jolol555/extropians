<a name="4691qlink6">This is yet another area where people differ. Would you like to become
(say) a bit more assertive or more calm? Many people would likely say
yes, despite that this changes your personality. Would you like to get
immensely enhanced memory and perception?  Again, many would say yes
even if this really has implications for our whole way of
living. Would you change your values? Some people actually would like
some alterations here even if they are not as common. 

<p>
I think changing personality is a quite valid transhumanist activity.
Much of the philosophy really involves developing a positive,
efficient and adaptable personality. How far you want to change, that
is an individual matter.</a>

<p>
<a href="4685.html#4687qlink3">&gt; I wouldn't suggest that you resign yourself to a completely hedonistic</a><br>
<i>&gt; life-style of 24/7 orgies (although the idea does have its attractions!).</i><br>
<i>&gt; But rather than taking the quick and easy "out" of chemically modifying your</i><br>
<i>&gt; behavior, I'd suggest alternative routes. Just as your sex drive is part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; your identity, make the modification process part of your identity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Meditation, counseling, even self-hypnosis could all bring your</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-perceived problem under control. Transhumanists in general (myself</i><br>
<i>&gt; included) do sometimes look for a technological answer to problems when</i><br>
<i>&gt; other, more appropriate or effective, methods are available.</i><br>

<p>
True. Taking a pill is much easier and cheaper (at least in terms of
time and effort) than real metaprogramming. And making continuing
change and self-determination part of oneself is a good heuristic.

<p>
<a name="4691qlink12">What I worry about is that the tendency to suggest that the "solution"
to many personal problems today is to not see the problem as a problem
needing a real solution but something to be accepted. It is even more
obvious when you discuss death. A lot of psychology seems based on the
idea of making people worry less by accepting various bad things
rather than changing them ("I'm fat and crave sugar - but I feel good
about</a> it!").
