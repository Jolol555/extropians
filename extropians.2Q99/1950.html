 &gt; "To our users: SETI@home is off to a great start! We now have<br>
 &gt; almost 350,000 users, many more than we expected. This has caused<br>

<p>
It is probably just a temporary spike. Many will drop out as soon as
the novelty will have worn off. Two years is a long time for the Net
attention span.

<p>
<i> &gt; some temporary problems: </i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt;      Our servers are overloaded. You have probably seen "can't</i><br>
 &gt;      connect to server" messages; the problem is at our end, not<br>
 &gt;      yours. <br>
 
<p>
Couldn't they have anticipated that?
 
<p>
 &gt;      Credit for work units and CPU time may not show up immediately<br>
 &gt;      in your totals.<br>

<p>
And that?
  
<p>
 &gt;      Our new "team" feature has had some problems; If you've joined<br>
 &gt;      a team, you may need to get a new password and join it again.<br>
 
<p>
Couldn't they have made seti@home a part of distributed.net, and
relied on their extensive expertise?
  
<p>
<i> &gt;      We are a bit overwhelmed with emails and bug reports, and won't</i><br>
 &gt;      be able to respond to them individually. Please check our "known      bugs"<br>
 &gt; list carefully before reporting problems. <br>
 
<p>
And ditto?

<p>
<i> &gt; We're working hard to fix these problems. With the help of new high-performance</i><br>
 &gt; machines from Sun Microsystems, we'll upgrade our server capacity; this will<br>
 &gt; happen in about a month. We'll release<br>

<p>
A Beowulf cluster with a much better price/performace ratio, stability 
and scalability could be installed within a few days, at a much lower
absolute cost. Perhaps excusable, if they got the hardware donated.

<p>
<i> &gt; new versions of the client software (probably next week) that will</i><br>
<i> &gt; deal with server problems in a more user-friendly way. </i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
 &gt; So please bear with us during these "growing pains", and thanks for being part<br>
 &gt; of this incredible project."<br>
