That is completely rediculous.  Technology can only reveal clues surrounding a culture, but does little to reveal the cultural milieu itself.  Ok, so we know they used fire to create ceraminc pots, and they had what appears to be a panthiestic style of worship.  That tells us nothing.  If we actually has a score of translated documents in their own words, it would tell us substanially more than what we could do through some carbon dating.

Besides, how can you possibly know the Library of Alexandria contained nothing worth considering?  To you claim to know what you don't know?  Sounds paradoxical to me.  Besides, much of modern science traces it routes directly back to manuscripts recovered from Alexandria.  Imagine howe much more time would have been saved, had Alexandria not burned.  We could have entered the sceintifc/technological age back in the 12th Century.  Imagine that!



  This is because we have technology.

Please explain to me the discovery of an electrical battery with copper wire found in Iraq and dated to the 8th Century B.C.

Again, this unfounded and it implies that nothing but the hard sciences have absolutely no value to human culture.  Who is to say that certain insights that the ancients had would *not* give fresh perspectivea into our current delima's?</a>
