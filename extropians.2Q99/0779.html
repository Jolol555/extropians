<a href="0767.html#0779qlink1">&gt;I suspect that, if given the choice today, more would choose to be males,</a><br>
<i>&gt;primarily (I regret to say) because there are still more social rewards and</i><br>
<i>&gt;opportunities for males than females in general.</i><br>

<p>
I don't know that one gender will be predominately chosen in western
culture. I know that I have a strong desire for a son, and when and if the
time comes I will ensure this happens (technology can already do this). The
reason for my choice is rather simple; I have always had interests that are
more typically "male", such as video games, martial arts, action figures,
etc. I have always been more able to relate to male children than female
children. Therefore, I am more comfortable with the prospect of raising a
male child.

<p>
However, I know of at least two men who if they had their druthers would
have daughters.  So, it seems fairly well balanced in my limited experience.

<p>
If you want to get really controversial, I can bring up the point that the
smartest man will be smarter than the smartest female as a rule. Of course,
the dumbest man will also be dumber than the dumbest woman. Women just tend
more towards the average.

<p>
Men can also _as a rule_ adjust to change better than women, and the future
will bring about a lot of changes and people will need to be as adaptable as
possible.

<p>
I'm sorry if bringing this up makes anyone angry; it's just simple
evolutionary biology.

<p>
As society stands now, both men and woman have strengths that society needs,
and golly gee it just turned out that we compliment each other rather
nicely:-)<a name="0841qlink1"> Of course, once we get to the point where we can use technology to
change our gender predispositions, all bets are off. I just know that both
genders have skills that are necessary, and I don't know how likely it would
be that on average one person could have both sets, since they both involve
characteristics that I don't think would mesh well together. Of course, who
knows what a transhuman could accomplish?</a>
