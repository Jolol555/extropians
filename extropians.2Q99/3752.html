<a name="3945qlink5"><a name="3817qlink1">I want a gun that shoots ethical flechettes.</a>  That is, the gun has the
situational awareness at least of a policeman that's hiding in your
pocket or handbag.  It talks to the ammunition.  Of course, the gun would
talk</a> with you.

<p>
<a name="3817qlink2"><a name="3761qlink1">I calculated that a human-equivalent-intelligence (HEI) would fit into
several thousand cubic microns, and with quantum intelligence, it could
run several thousand times as fast as human time. (mechanical is smaller,
but slower)</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3817qlink3">With good nanotech, we can also have lasers running off a phased-array on
a flechette, so we can get a pin-hole microarray radar that's not too
constrained by the reolution radius of its antenna.</a>

<p>
<a name="3817qlink4">You shoot it, and the flechettes decide what to do, and the gun is the
witness, and sends signed e-mail to the police on the wireless internet
using micropower pulse radio.</a>

<p>
<a name="3817qlink5">If you're a bad guy, a dumb kid, or a drunk, or tampered with the gun, 
the flechettes refuse to fire. or tumble at mach 8 and self-destruct,
because they're inherently unstable.</a>

<p>
<a name="3817qlink6">If you're a good guy, the flechettes cause the least possible damage that
will let you get away, shoot the deer that's kicking your kid, hunt, hit
the 9 ring of the paper target, or whatever.</a>

<p>
<a name="3817qlink7">The magazines rebuild the flechettes from CO2 and water in the air, plus
electricity.  Maybe this takes a while, if the only solar cell is the
surface of the gun.  That way, in a survival situation, the gun is
self-provisioning.</a>
