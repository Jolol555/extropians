<a name="0032qlink1">Yes you can do this, but I don't see how it helps decide whether the 
SIA is true. (For other people following this thread: The 
Self-Indication Axiom states roughly that upon finding that you 
exist, you should increase your probability for hypotheses according 
to which many people exist. (There would be "more slots for you to be 
born into" if there were more persons.)  It can be shown that 
adopting the SIA leads to the exact cancellation of the probability 
shift required by the DA. This would seem the main reason to adopt 
the SIA. However, there are big problems with the SIA which seem to 
make it ultimately unacceptable.)</a>
