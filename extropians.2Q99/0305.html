I'm an inventor,entrepreneur and "technological visonary" in Discover Magazine's words.
My formal studies are in Aerospace Engineering and Physics (UW). No degrees.
I also study and research many other areas of technology.
I’ve owned businesses in boat building, contracting, automotive, embedded systems, other.

<p>
I have experience in 3D modeling and animation, machining, prototyping, electronics,
composite fabrication, a whole bunch of other things.

<p>
Some things I care about: your mental health, your achievements, your future state.

<p>
Some things I don’t care about: your country, your religion, your degrees, your tattoos.

<p>
Most recent non-technical books read:
<br>
“The Common Good” by Noam Chomsky
<br>
“The Chomsky Reader” by Noam Chomsky

<p>
Longtime personal goals: to see the world as it is. To move into Space.
To transcend current human limitations.
<hr>

<p>
A few old inventions/conceptions:

<p>
Dean Drive type propulsion. (1965) (age 10) (note 1)
Raster-scan atomic dis-assemblers, assemblers. (1967) (note 2)
Digital storage and transmission of atom types and positions of entire human body. (1967) (note 2)
Mass transfer via particle beams. (1967) (note 2)
TSTO hybrid, composite, balloon-launch amateur satellite. (1976) (note 3)
“Orbital Cables”. (1980) (note 4)
<br>
“Pellet Stream Propulsion” (the core of the “Interworld System”). (1980) (note 5)
Ducted-fan, electric tethered camera platform (1995), in development
Other things at IASE site in sig file.

<p>
(note 1) Everybody invents this, it’s like perpetual motion machines.
(note 2) From a science class paper titled “Teleportation”. Several of my current
projects date to this study, most notably my nanotech work.
<pre>
(note 3) The first amateur rocket to reach Space (1997) used similar ideas.
(note 4) Now called “Orbital Loops”. Pre-empted on publication.
(note 5) Pre-empted on publication.

Some current and recent projects:

<p>
Designing a biomolecular/nanotech invivo submersible (one micron width, bilpid layer skin panels,
kinesin drive, pilin harpoons, cilia maneuvering system, submillimeter radio, keratin frame) (IASE).

<p>
Designing a variable-geometry, HTHL, personal SSTO space shuttle (&lt;200 kg empty mass, carbon
nanotube/silica composite, combined-cycle hypersonic arcjet, seats four.) (IASE).

<p>
Contracting computer animations. (Interworld Productions).

<p>
Producing a television show about nanotechnology (Interworld Productions).

<p>
Further work on the “Interworld System” Space transportation network (IASE).

<p>
Developing a proposal for private, near-term industrial exploitation of Space (IASE).

<p>
Developing a patent suite in the general areas of atom lithography, Optical Assembly.

<p>
Building a business plan in the general area of molecular assembly.
