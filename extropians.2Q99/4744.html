<p>
If you elect your officials and they run around brutalizing the
residents of other countries when you go visiting outside your home
country you're in big trouble. There are people who attack US
citizens whenever/wherever they find them, often for the strangest
reasons, but sometimes for good reasons. In other words you (US
citizen) will be held accountable for the governments actions. 


<p>
<a href="4733.html#4744qlink4">&gt;I don't think the US government is all that terrible, but it seems</a><br>
<i>&gt;to have a tendency to murder a bunch of its citizens every few</i><br>
<i>&gt;years.</i><br>

<p>
I don't mind the government much with the exception of the current
resident of the white house, it would be better if it were much
smaller and quit sticking it's nose in things that don't concern
it.

<p>
I supported action in Kosovo, but it should not have been NATO
except as a last resort. It should have gone before the U.N. and
then military action if necessary.
