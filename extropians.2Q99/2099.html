In safe, civilized gun-free Britain, they go to jail; there was a shopowner
in Liverpool three or four years ago who got fed up with being robbed at
gunpoint by crooks with illegal handguns so he spent $60 on an illegal
handgun of his own and the next time an armed robber turned up the 
shopowner shot him dead. Rather than praising him for helping to reduce
the crime rate, the cops charged him with numerous serious crimes and he
went to jail for years.

Such a civilized country now they've banned guns, ain't it?
