I'm following it up now.]

<a name="0501qlink1"><i>&gt;Perhaps most puzzling is the failure to use any significant </i><br>

<p>
I think the central assumption Vinge used here is that no stable forms of
social organization are possible in the Slow Zone, or if one does exist
it's too difficult for Slow Zoners to discover or invent. Even the most
stable organizational forms become increasingly unstable as a civilization
develops technologically and economically, eventually suffering a
catastrophic collapse. The Slow Zone governments must try to delay this
</a>
collapse by restricting economic growth and research into destabilizing
technologies, which would explain the slow growth rates and (combined with
complexity limits) the lack of nanotechnology.

<a name="0501qlink2"><i>&gt;These falls are very severe, often requiring re colonization from</i><br>
<i>&gt;the outside, and otherwise seem to require rebuilding from </i><br>
<i>&gt;scratch.  This is much more severe than the fall of the Roman </i><br>
<i>&gt;Empire, for example.  Powerful weapons of war might explain</i><br>
<i>&gt;this, but the worst weapons we see in the story are nukes.  Are </i><br>
<i>&gt;nuke wars really enough to destroy civilizations so thoroughly?</i><br>
</a>

<p>
We also see biological weapons, which should be sufficient.

<p>
<i>&gt;The frustrating thing about using science fiction to think</i><br>

<i>&gt;they had good reasons to expect things described, whether they</i><br>

<i>&gt;the author just didn't even notice them.  I suspect one big </i><br>
<i>&gt;problem is that Vinge doesn't really believe in these limits.</i><br>

<p>
He might not believe these limits, but I don't think he rules them out
completely either.
