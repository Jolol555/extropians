<a href="2428.html#2437qlink1">&gt; The environmental impact of gm crops is phenomenal, and extreme caution</a><br>

<p>
It's not GM crops in general, it's certain GM modifications.  The BT plants,
for example, express BT in all cells all the time.  I can't believe they'd do
that.  It's just like spraying insecticide all the time and will result in 
rapid
<br>
resistance.  Insecticides should only be used when needed to slow resistance.
The BT plants should produce BT only when induced by insect damage -
which is how plants often produce their own pesticides.  If they did that,
it would be no more hazard than current targeted spraying - less, probably.

<p>
While resistance is indeed a problem it's not entirely insoluble.  You can
stay ahead of the bugs. Proof:  humans exist and can live for decades 
surrounded by hostiles.  Likewise, plants can and do use endogenously
produced insecticides and they do help.  

<p>
The more conspiracy oriented say that the point of this *is* to induce
tolerance to BT, which is a favored organic pesticide.
