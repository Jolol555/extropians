It seems to be a rare thing here that someone doesn't equate the
transhuman future with the time when he/she can get to have everything
in the universe, and tough luck to anybody else!<a name="1335qlink1"> Surely an increase in
technological/sociological/xxxxological state implied by the Singularity
must leave in tatters our ideas of property/free market, just as it
leaves in tatters most other concepts of current western culture,</a> which
all appear to trace back to fundamentals of limited lifespan and
scarcity.

<a name="1335qlink2">Rugged individualism indeed. But are there alternatives?</a> 

<p>
<a name="1335qlink3">If there were some viable system of managing it (anyone?), then why not
have resources available to all who need them.</a> The premise behind this
is that pragmatically, nobody really needs more than a small fraction of
these resources at any one time. Of course there would end up being
limits, but I don't think that they should be any worse than the limits
of private ownership of property, where each person only has access to
what he/she owns, what the government provides (at some cost!), and what
others are willing to lend/give.

<p>
If it works well, then the resources available to most people would be
far greater than those they might otherwise have access to. Maybe the
Gates/Turner/Murdochs of the world might have to come down a peg, but
for the rest of us, why can't it be beneficial?

<p>
I think that the concept of infinite personal wealth through capitalism
is flawed. People are attracted to it because it is possible, whereas
without property ownership it is not. But possible is not probably. Not
many can actually do it, lots of luck is involved. and those who do
either start with a massive kickstart or devote their entire lives
primarily to accumulation of capital, which really is an empty and
pointless pursuit.

<p>
So in the end, those who have truly noble pursuits in mind often don't
have the means (because they are devoted to the pursuit, not to aquiring
resources toward that pursuit), and those who have the resources often
don't have any idea of what to do with them (except maybe for sensual
stimulation and aquisition of more resources). 

<p>
I'm interested in the nexus between the dream of technological
salvation, and the dream of capitalist success. The idea that
technological advance will benefit us all seems to clash with the
reality that technological advance benefits the owners of the technology
(wealthy people) and often disadvantages the great majority of the
population. I don't think that the "crumbs from the rich man's table
theory" (the trickle down effect) really makes up for the increased
ability of people who already control large amounts of resources to get
their hands on more, to the detriment of others.

<p>
The usual line of reasoning on the forementioned moves toward the
conclusion that technology must be bad and it should stop. Of course I
am not a going to take such a technophobic line, and in any case, trying
to stop humans discovering/inventing/using new things is like standing
in the surf trying to hold back the waves with cupped hands (good luck
banning cloning). I am of the opinion that it is the economic/social
system, not technological advancement, which causes these problems.

<p>
<a name="1335qlink4">I'm not in favour of a socialist system, however - is anyone disposed
this way on this list? Everyone seems to love the government...</a>

<p>
<a name="1335qlink5">What about some form of techno-anarchy, where we use the excellent
communications which are now just developing across the world, and are
going to advance wildly in the next couple of decades, to allocate
resources to anyone who asks for them, on some kind of loan system.</a>
Maybe you keep track of who's had how much (ie: currency), or maybe you
don't bother. Maybe you need other people to volunteer support to your
"cause" to aquire more than a certain amount of resources, or maybe
little governing committees just spring up around areas that they are
interested in, without any higher level organisation (much like
newsgroups/mailing lists, but with decision making power).

<p>
<a name="1335qlink6">This is pretty basic, re-inventing the wheel kind of stuff, but I think
it's important to realise that capitalism (or owning things) is not the
only possible social</a> system and may not be desirable as social needs
change in the next century. I think that it will be altogether
undesirable, as will fall as it becomes less stable and more of a
barrier to our potential. It is an artifact invented by humans, and can
be superceded by more advanced artifacts (invented by transhumans).

PS: But in the mean time, I'll be aquiring all the wealth I can get my
hands on, because I think real life extension is going to be X-Pensive!
Rugged individualism indeed!
