I've heard about these types of technologies and there are a number of ways
to do this, and they all work like any other generator.  They just operate
at extreme velocities and therefore generate a shorter, bigger power spike.

<p>
The simplest would be something like the inverse of a rail gun.  The
explosives are used to drive an appropriate projectile through the tube at
extreme velocities.  Using low (deflagrating) explosives you could achieve
about 2,000 m/s and with high (detonating) explosives about 10,000 m/s.  As
long as you are not worried about where the projectile goes after it leaves
the generator, such a generator could be used many times at a rapid rate of
fire.  I've seen power generated this way, although neither with explosives
nor with any intent of doing something useful with the power generated.

<p>
Obviously, there are number of ways you could do this.  This was just the
first one to cross my mind.
