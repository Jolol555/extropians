I can agree that there is an level of distrust in rational thought in
society, perhaps its because many folks don't learn how to think
rationally as children. There is a lot of pressure to just react and not
analyse.</a>
<br>
But!
<br>
I have seen a lot of folks in rubber rooms who took "not feeling" to a
point that they lost touch with large segments of their personalities. I
won't say that not feeling is the only way into a padded cell, but it is
one of the ways.
<br>
I think that feeling supplies context to the life experience and without
that, life can't have much meaning.
