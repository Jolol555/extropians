Indeed. One of the supposed 'benefits' of government is that it can force
disparate groups to come to a 'reasonable, rational compromise', and avoid
conflict. The problem is that 'reasonable, rational compromise' satisfies
neither side, so the conflict is simply hidden, and continues to grow until
it eventually escalates into all-out war. But since the government is 
allowed to claim that war deaths aren't murders, the murder rate is much
lower.

<a name="3501qlink1">Again, one of the biggest problems with British society is that almost
no-one complains about anything. Part of that is because it's a recovering
socialist nation,</a> and people are used to living in a society where the
government ran everything and couldn't care less about complaints. But a
lot of it is because people are programmed to be 'nice' and 'polite' and
not upset anyone. So rather than getting angry at what happens during the
day, they go to the pub, get drunk, and then beat each other up.

<a href="3038.html#3388qlink3">&gt;of Star Trek, always logical and rational.  Does this sound desirable?</a><br>

<p>
Certainly not to me... increased rationality, yes, Vulcans, no.

A lot of the recent subscribers to the list seem to believe that this is
both possible and a good idea.

<a name="3501qlink3">I think it's more a matter of being emotional rationally, if that makes
any sense. A lot of our emotional reactions are irrational and counterproductive,
 but a lot of them are useful both to us and to others; if
you don't get angry when someone is annoying you then they may well 
continue to do so simply because they don't realise it. Ideally we want
to remove the irrational emotional reactions while keeping the rest.
