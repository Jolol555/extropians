<a href="3050.html#3603qlink1">&gt; &gt; Carl Sagan observed that astronomy emerged out of astrology.</a><br>

<p>
     I think of Carl Sagan as more of a pimp than a scientist.

<p>
<a href="3050.html#3603qlink2">&gt;This is one of my interests, how science evolves from nonscience.</a><br>

<p>
     I have a friend that started his career in physics (but then became a 
lawyer). I have been a practitioner of various forms of "sorcery" for more 
than 20 years. My friend believes in astrology. I do not.

<p>
<a name="3636qlink1">     I do not know if there is any "hard" science left to be extracted out 
of old school occultism; although I have read some interesting material by 
modern alchemists regarding monoatomic gold and other m-state precious 
metals as medicines.</a>

     Nowadays, magick seems to borrow more from science than the other way 
around. The names Bell and Bohm are now heard almost as frequently as the 
names Crowley and Spare.

<p>
     On the other tentacle, sociologist William Sims Bainbridge has called 
magick "radical psychology". Even if it is only that, the techniques 
employed in the areas of INVOCATION and ILLUMINATION in Chaos Magick would 
be of great utility to any Extropian.
