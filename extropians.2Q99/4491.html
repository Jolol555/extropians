Absolutely. It is an essential tool of kinematics and dynamics, but
those have to do with one particle acting on another particle and
vice-versa. Of course it would be nonsense to assume non-causality
action in that situation.

<p>
But considering a non-causal system that has NO ability to CAUSE
anything does not defy physics.

<p>
A mind is a non-causal, caused phenomenon. Where does your next thought
come from? All you know is that they are strung together in some
coherent fashion. And recognizing that FACT is yet another thought that
you didn't know you were going to have. Our thoughts are caused by a
combination of internal and external forces. We only EXPERIENCE those
thoughts.

<p>
In that sense, the mind can be likened to an image on a movie screen,
while the brain itself is the movie projector. When you consider the
image on the screen in the abstract, you can't think of it as a causal
phenomenon. It simply exists. And each frame only exists for but ONE
moment of time. (In this case, this is movie time -- 30 moments per
second. But minds exist in Planck time -- trillions of moments per
second.)

<p>
Now, my experience as a conscious being is caused. But I experience all
of those individual causes (signals in my brain) simultaneously and
coherently. So even though there is a visual cortex, an auditory cortex,
a linguistic cortex, etc. in my brain, I experience the net sum of all
those spatially separated signals simultaneously. They interfere to form
a pattern - me.

<p>
I theorize that it is only these PARTICULAR signals that overlap because
they are all bounded within the same medium -- the medium of the brain.
The sensory transducers and actuators of the body isolate the
waves/signals of the brain from the rest of the universe. So the
superluminal interconnections of the pattern are ALSO isolated to that
medium.

<p>
And of course, different mediums (electronic as opposed to meatware per
se) will associate different patterns (modulations) to the SAME
information. So the subjective experience (qualia) will be different as
well -- even though both sets of qualia are isomorphically linked to the
same set of input data.

<p>
As Marshall McCluhan famously articulated, "the medium is the message."
