Obviously, this is not a case of someone walking into a gun shop and
ordering 25,000 pistols or rifles. The law, if any, should be so written as
to allow SOME common sense to be used in its' enforcement.

Yeah, I know, dream on. Personally, I don't want anyone telling me how to
spend my money. The insidious thing about all this gun regulation talk is
that it starts to make some views sound palatable on first hearing, until
someone else points out a fallacy. It is easy to assume the worst</a> when
presented with a scenario like multiple gun purchases. I imagine that the
spin doctors do this on purpose to warp more people into their way of
thinking.
