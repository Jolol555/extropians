    &gt; Has the causal connection been broken or not?<br>

<p>
I think some (not all) of your questions can be answered by having
<a name="0395qlink1">a definition of causality that is consistent with our everyday use of
the term and yet produces few philosophical problems:

<p>
If event A causes event B that means two things and two things only:


<OL>
  <li>  If you find event A you are certain to find event B further along a
    sequence of events.

  <li>  If you find event B you may or may not find event A
</a>
    in the opposite direction.


</OL>
<p>
This asymmetry is useful, humans call one direction along the sequence of events
"The Future" and the other direction "The Past". I don't know why the sequence is
organized the way it is, I don't know why only one sequence seems to be real
and thus only 2 directions exist in time. I'm not even sure it's true
and there are only 2 directions in time.

<p>
Sometimes people feel there is a third property causality must have,
namely a story that connects A to B, however as this invariably brings in other
causal connections it obviously has no place in a fundamental definition.

<p>
I think most of the Turing machines you mention in your post would be
conscious despite the unconventional way they operate; it's not difficult
to extrapolate some bizarre and perhaps even disturbing conclusions
from there, but so be it. Anyway, that's the way this Turing machine sees it.
