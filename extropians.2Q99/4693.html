Well, this is the problem with information.  A lot of it is out there and
people can look for it if they really want to know, but most people are
comfortable (sometimes your truly falls for this trap too) not looking into
things.

<p>
And regarding the ability to find all this stuff out from the internet,
there is also a lot of noise out.  I'm sure if the internet becomes a major
place for individuals, government agencies, and companies to find out the
poop about people in a major way, those who want to prevent this will create
lots of noise, e.g., faked web pages and the like.  Also, if someone wants
to trash someone, they might do something like, for instance,
<a href="http://gwbush.com/">http://gwbush.com/</a>, which fooled many in the Press into thinking it was the
official George W. Bush web site.

<p>
Cheers!
