Dwayne, with all due respect, perhaps these last comments and some of the 
other ones above demonstrate why the "gun debate" seems to drive such deep 
and emotional wedges between people.  Although we try to be rational and 
realistic, by and large extropians are optimistic about the future of 
mankind.  Most of us take an adventurous attitude toward individual liberty 
and don't feel threatened by the idea of "concentrations of people" that are 
free from high levels of governmental constraints. And I think people who 
call themselves extropians should certainly not fear liberty as something 
that "only benefits the rich"; far from it: Extropians see liberty as a 
condition of prosperity for each individual and society as a whole.  Finally, 
I have to take exception with the idea that "allowing everyone to do whatever 
the hell they want" could in any way be considered a fair characterization of 
libertarianism. Rather, it is the sort of rhetorical caricature that can only 
inflame thoughtful people who come to value liberty as a primary ingredient 
of a healthy society after a life-long study of history -- which is how I 
would characterize myself.

<a href="2616.html#2685qlink3">&gt;  Go bite me, Michael.  I'm not interested in debating guns with you</a><br>
<i>&gt;  because your argument is bullshit, okay? I have the option of moving to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the US and living in a "free" country armed to the teeth.  I have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  currently-standing offer of work and a place to stay in San Francisco.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The concept of living in the US terrifies me, frankly, as I quite like</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the fact that I can walk *anywhere* in the city I live in (4 million</i><br>
<i>&gt;  people) and not get shot.  I have a couple of friends who are</i><br>
<i>&gt;  considering similar options. We all feel the same way.  </i><br>

As I've done at least once before, I feel compelled to point out for the 
benefit of those who may not have visited the States that the vast majority 
of Americans do not live in fear of gun violence, that action and gangster 
movies are not an accurate depiction of life in American cities, that the 
vast majority of Americans never hear a gunshot outside of a shooting range 
or hunting trip, that there are many peacefully racially integrated 
neighborhoods (mine included) where people from wildly different cultural, 
ethnic and racial backgrounds live together with civility and mutual respect 
and that violent crime simply isn't part of the day-to-day experience of the 
great majority of Americans.  I know from personal experience that European 
cities are different from American cities, but not in the way that I too 
often see caricatured: The trade-offs of freedom and security are real, but 
they are more subtle and the differences in the texture of life is not really 
so great as one might imagine from reading material like the paragraph above.
