<p>
From: "Raymond G. Van De Walker" &lt;rgvandewalker@juno.com&gt;

<p>
<a href="3752.html#3817qlink1">&gt;I want a gun that shoots ethical flechettes.  That is, the gun has</a><br>
<i>&gt;the situational awareness at least of a policeman that's hiding in</i><br>
<i>&gt;your pocket or handbag.  It talks to the ammunition.  Of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the gun would talk with you.</i><br>
</a>

<p>
<a name="4288qlink1"><a name="3821qlink2"><a href="3752.html#3817qlink2">&gt;I calculated that a human-equivalent-intelligence (HEI) would fit</a><br>
<i>&gt;into several thousand cubic microns,</a> and with quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence, it could run several thousand times as fast as human</i><br>
<i>&gt;time. (mechanical is smaller, but slower)</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3752.html#3817qlink3">&gt;With good nanotech, we can also have lasers running off a</a><br>
<i>&gt;phased-array on a flechette, so we can get a pin-hole microarray</i><br>
<i>&gt;radar that's not too constrained by the reolution radius of its</i><br>
<i>&gt;antenna.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3752.html#3817qlink4">&gt;You shoot it, and the flechettes decide what to do, and the gun is</a><br>
<i>&gt;the witness, and sends signed e-mail to the police on the wireless</i><br>
<i>&gt;internet using micropower pulse radio.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3752.html#3817qlink5">&gt;If you're a bad guy, a dumb kid, or a drunk, or tampered with the</a><br>
<i>&gt;gun, the flechettes refuse to fire. or tumble at mach 8 and</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-destruct, because they're inherently unstable.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3752.html#3817qlink6">&gt;If you're a good guy, the flechettes cause the least possible</a><br>
<i>&gt;damage that will let you get away, shoot the deer that's kicking</i><br>
<i>&gt;your kid, hunt, hit the 9 ring of the paper target, or whatever.</a></i><br>

<p>
<a name="3821qlink3"><a href="3752.html#3817qlink7">&gt;The magazines rebuild the flechettes from CO2 and water</a> in the</a><br>
<a name="3821qlink4"><i>&gt;air, plus electricity.  Maybe this takes a while, if the only</i><br>
<i>&gt;solar cell is the surface of the gun.  That way, in a survival</i><br>
<i>&gt;situation, the gun is self-provisioning.</a></i><br>
                    
<p>
Interesting and excellent post.

<p>
<a name="3821qlink5">When I was a kid I was fascinated by electric eels. I was convinced
that it was just a matter of time when the biological realm fell to
the skills of engineers. I wrote a piece in 8th grade where I
fantasized about people with newly grown organs and the defensive
capability of large electric eels. I included what I knew about the
insulation the eels possessed that kept them from frying
themselves.</a>

<p>
The nuns were convinced I was the one "possessed".

<p>
This is classic Bruce Sterling mechanist's vs shapers stuff.
