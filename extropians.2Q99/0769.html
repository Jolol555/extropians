Well Scott,
<p>
     I am a tomboy and honestly most women, (but not all) annoy me 
probably in the same aspects that they could annoy men. They are more 
emotional, insecure and in need of validating.I know I am one, and 
sometimes even hate my own estrogen.
<p>
     Although you appropriatly state that men aquire more social 
rewards women have their way's of manipulating things in their 
direction also. I like the physicality of being a woman, it's 
somewhat artistic. As a matter of fact, I was originally an artist 
(and still am) before struck in the head with nanofever,and for some 
reason I tend to draw the female body more than not.
<p>
   Yes, men do have in general, more physical strength, although I 
was a jock up until my car wreck (basketball blah blah). But as far 
as selecting one over the other, that's a difficult call to make, I 
find beauty in most human beings.
<br>
And it's the differences that makes the world more than boring.
