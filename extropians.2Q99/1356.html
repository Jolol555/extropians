Honestly, I don't come to the same conclusion, from the evidence I see. 
I agree that people are being quite devastating to the biosphere and many
people have strong desires to hurt themselves and their world, but I
think that most of the damage is being done out of ignorance and
adherence to tradition.  Traditions change as each individual decides
what to continue and what to discontinue.  Ignorance can be dealt with in
many ways also.  My favorite is simply giving others honest feedback on
the effects of their actions and making sure there is little they can do
to avoid awareness of the fact that they are destroying much which they
would probably rather not in the long term.</a>
