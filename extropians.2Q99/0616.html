<a name="0631qlink1"><a name="0619qlink1">This being said, I am 31 and I have not signed up for cryonic suspension.</a> My rationalization for this act of pure laziness and/or stinginess is that according to the stats, if I die in the next two decades it is most likely to be something which leaves my brain in a useless state, and anything else that happens is likely to give me plenty of a heads up that I will have time to sign up for suspension before it kills me. Cryonics is a last ditch option, which IMHO is most likely to be used by the oldsters on the list than the youngsters. Caveat: I will probably sign up sometime in the next ten years anyways if I wind up having a wife and kids that will make it much more worthwhile to come back to.
