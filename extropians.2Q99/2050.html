Legal gun owners, demographically, have the lowest incidence of violent crime of
any demographic group. We set the standard of non-violence that the rest of the
so-called non-violent pacifistic culture can't seem to meet. You're statement
about 'enslaving oneself to a gun' is rather pathetic, since: a) you can't
enslave yourself to an inanimate object, b) if you could, IMHO that would be by
choice, and is far far better than becoming forcibly enslaved to the
government/criminal terrocrat industry.</a>

<a name="2192qlink2">A gun is a technological tool, like any other tool (i.e. a PC, a cell phone,
nanotech, brain implants, cryonic suspension, etc) is merely a means to greater

<a name="2192qlink4">it away. It has no interest in giving you greater ability, as that is a threat
to its own power. Un-extropic individuals hate us and the things we stand for.
They will not stop at mere legal maneuvers to prevent us from acheiving our
goals.</a>

rate than gun owners.</a>
