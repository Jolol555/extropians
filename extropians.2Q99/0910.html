  Grape juice but not orange or grapefruit juice inhibits platelet activity in

Abstract
<br>
  Platelet aggregation (PA) contributes to both the development of
  atherosclerosis and acute platelet thrombus formation (APTF) followed by
  embolization producing cyclic flow reductions (CFR) in stenosed and damaged
  dog and human coronary arteries. In seven anesthetized dogs with coronary
  stenosis and medial damage, CFR occurred at 7 +/- 3/30 min and were abolished
  127 +/- 18 min after gastric administration of 10 mL of purple grape
  juice/kg. Collagen-induced ex vivo whole blood PA decreased by 49 +/- 9%
  after the abolishment of CFR with grape juice. Ten mL of orange juice/kg (n =
  5) and 10 mL of grapefruit juice/kg (n = 5) had no significant effect on the
  frequency of the CFR or on ex vivo PA. In vitro studies have suggested that
  flavonoids bind to platelet cell membranes and thus may have an accumulative
  or tissue-loading effect over time. To test this we fed 5 mL of grape
  juice/kg to 5 cynomologous monkeys for 7 d. Collagen-induced ex vivo PA
  decreased by 41 +/- 17% compared to control (pre-reatment) after 7 d of
  feeding. In the same 5 monkeys, neither 5 mL of orange juice/kg nor 5 mL of
  grapefruit juice/kg given orally for 7 d produced any significant change in
  PA. Grape juice contains the flavonoids quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin,
  which are known inhibitors of PA in vitro. Orange juice and grapefruit juice,
  while containing less quercetin than grape juice, primarily contain the
  flavonoids naringin, luteolin and apigenin glucoside. The flavonoids in
  grapes were shown in vitro to be good inhibitors of PA,
  whereas the flavonoids in oranges and grapefruit to be poor inhibitors of PA.
  The consumption of grape juice, containing these inhibitors of PA, may have
  some of the protection offered by red wine against the development of
  coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute occlusive thrombosis, whereas orange
  juice or grapefruit juice may be ineffective. Thus, grape juice may be a
  useful alternative dietary supplement to red wine without the concomitant
  alcohol intake.

<br>
  Expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway genes in red and white
  grapes.

  Plant Molecular Biology.  32(3):565-9, 1996 Nov.
Abstract
<br>
  The expression of seven genes from the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway was
  determined in different tissues of Shiraz grapevines. All of the tissues
  contained proanthocyanidins, but only the berry skin accumulated
  anthocyanins. In most tissues, all of the flavonoid genes except UDP
  glucose-flavonoid 3-o-glucosyl transferase (UFGT) were expressed, but UFGT
  expression was only detected in berry skin. Similar patterns of expression
  were observed in the skin of other red grapes. In white
  grapes, UFGT expression was not detected. White grape
  cultivars appear to lack anthocyanins because they lack UFGT, although they
  also had decreased expression of other flavonoid pathway genes.

  A case-control study of oral cancer in Beijing, People's Republic of China.
  Associations with nutrient intakes, foods and food groups.

Abstract
<br>
  A case-control study of oral cancer was conducted in Beijing, People's
  Republic of China to examine the association between dietary nutrient intake
  and risk of oral cancer, both in terms of estimated intake of nutrients and
  micro-nutrients, and in terms of specific foods and food groups. The study
  was hospital-based and controls were hospital in-patients matched for age and
  sex with the cases. The response rate for cases and controls was 100% and 404
  case/control pairs were interviewed. The results suggest that increased
  protein and fat intake are related to a decreased risk of oral cancer.
  Carbohydrate intake, however, showed a moderate increased risk for oral
  cancer. Total carotene intake and carotene intake from fruits and vegetables
  are inversely associated with risk of oral cancer. A similar pattern was
  observed for dietary vitamin C intake. Dietary fibre derived from fruits and
  vegetables showed a strong negative association with oral cancer risk, but
  fibre derived from other sources did not exhibit any protective effect. At
  the level of foods and food groups, increased consumption of fresh meat,
  chicken and liver was significantly associated with a reduction in oral
  cancer risk: the tests for trend were all statistically significant at the P
  &lt; 0.01 level. Consumption of common carp, hairtail, shrimp and lobster were
  also associated with decreased risk. Risk was found to increase with
  increasing consumption of millet and corn bread (P &lt; 0.01) but to decrease
  with increasing consumption of rice (P &lt; 0.01). Increased consumption of
  grapes, bananas, oranges, tangerines, peaches and pears were
  associated with reduced risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

  The role of dietary fiber in satiety, glucose, and insulin: studies with
  fruit and fruit juice.

Abstract
<br>
  Healthy volunteers ingested sugar-equivalent meals of oranges and orange
  juice and of grapes and grape juice. Satiety, assessed by
  two subjective scoring systems, was greater after whole fruit than after
  juice and the return of appetite was delayed. With oranges, as previously
  reported with apples, there was a significantly smaller insulin response to
  fruit than to juice and less postabsorptive fall in plasma glucose. With
  grapes, the insulin response to the whole fruit was,
  paradoxically, more than that to the juice, while postabsorptive glucose
  values were similar. The glucose in grapes appeared to be
  more insulinogenic than that in oranges and apples. Conversely, grape juice
  evoked less insulin than expected, possibly because its high osmolality
  delayed gastric emptying. However, diluting it did not increase its
  insulinogenicity. The plasma insulin and glucose responses to fruit appear to
  depend on the fiber as well as the glucose content of the fruit.
