<i>&gt; &gt; Since I have extremely limited time for seeing movies or other</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; movie eXistenZ. ... Has anyone seen it? Does it contain ideas worth going to see? Is it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stylistically excellent (like Matrix)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I saw _eXistenZ_ last weekend; I thought it was well worth seeing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; though quite different from _The Matrix_.  It wasn't stylish at</i><br>
<i>&gt; all, at least in the slick style of _The Matrix_; it looked distinctly</i><br>
<i>&gt; low-budget by comparison.  On the other hand, I got the idea that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the low budget look was part of the "point" of the movie (substitution</i><br>
<i>&gt; of drab VR scenarios, with shallow characters, hackneyed plot-lines,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and circumscribed possibilities, for the real thing).  As you might</i><br>
<i>&gt; gather, it casts a rather jaundiced eye at the possibility of "total"</i><br>
<i>&gt; VR.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Much of the film had a squishy, slightly gory character in keeping</i><br>
<i>&gt; with some of Cronenberg's earlier films (_Videodrome_, _The Brood_);</i><br>
<i>&gt; the game consoles are fleshy, vaguely sexual-looking appliances</i><br>
<i>&gt; that gurgle and squeak, and have breast-like extrusions that have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be squeezed, and nipples that have to be stroked, to operate them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They're connected to their human operators with a cable that looks</i><br>
<i>&gt; a lot more like an umbilical cord than a wire, and is plugged into an</i><br>
<i>&gt; opening in the spine called a "bioport", which looks like (in closeup),</i><br>
<i>&gt; and in some scenes is treated as, an additional body orifice in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; quasi-sexual</i><br>
<i>&gt; sense.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I thought it was a hoot -- by all means, see it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
I agree with Jim's description of the movie, but not his
recommendation to see it. There were no new ideas here
that I hadn't read about in any number of books or seen
before in other movies. In fact I felt the whole thing,
especially the ending, was quite simplistic and very
unfulfilling (sp?).
