Actually, it isn't - I considered that and discarded it back when I was
trying to figure out how to compute qualia.  The problem is that if you
removed the specks of proto-consciousness, everyone would act the same. 
The basic operations of a computer don't "act" on proto-consciousness,
they act on data.  In my model, if you shut off a human's qualia, ve
would go into a coma or, more likely, just keel over and die.

<p>
Chalmers has a simple code to describe our positions.  Chalmers codes
contain three letters; each letter is C, computational, P, physical, N,
neither.  The code describes what it would take to simulate, produce,
and explain consciousness.  Dennett is CCC; computation simulates,
produces, and explains consciousness.  Searle is CPP; computation can
simulate consciousness, but not produce or explain it.  Chalmers is CCN;
computation can simulate and produce consciousness, but not explain it. 
Penrose (and Yudkowsky) are PPP; physical laws simulate, produce, and
explain consciousness.

<p>
My position is simple:  No Zombies.  Only single-letter codes are
logically consistent.  Every facet of consciousness we can notice, that
we can *have a need to explain*, obviously influences our physical
actions.  If there's any quality of consciousness that doesn't influence
our actions, nobody has ever written a paper about it.  When you
perfectly simulate something, you have explained everything about it and
produced everything that exists in it.

<p>
Likewise, anything that affects our actions is a part of the laws of
physics, and a physical theory that doesn't include it will be incomplete.
