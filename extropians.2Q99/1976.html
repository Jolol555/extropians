As an American gun owner, I'd like to add my voice to this comment.  The 
recurring gun debate is usually prolonged by entrenched folks willing to 
engage in flame wars because the deep ideological divides and strong 
psychological factors involved aren't conducive to peaceful dialogue.  I'd 
like to request that posters in these threads limit their writing to a civil 
statement of their own positions and a willingness to let the matter go for 
now -- we've had too much experience with this topic here to believe that any 
resolution is likely for now.  BTW, I would love to take Anders up on his 
challenge to develop liberating technological responses to the issues (which 
IS very extropian), but unfortunately have a couple of large projects 
percolating at work now.  I'll end by reiterating a request for civility and 
that posters PLEASE refrain from unnecessary profanity.
