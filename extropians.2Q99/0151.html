<a name="0164qlink1"><a href="0143.html#0151qlink1">&gt; On Sun, 4 Apr 1999 08:53:03 -0500, you asked that I clarify my</a><br>
<i>&gt; statements:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm fully aware that health care choices don't amount to the same as</i><br>
<i>&gt; euthanasia in the eyes of the court. However, defenses and arguments</i><br>
<i>&gt; may have been raised during these proceedings which might prove useful</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a legal strategy defending euthanasia.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm also fully aware that Dr. Kevorkian is finding himself up the</i><br>
<i>&gt; creek without a paddle on this very same issue.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0160qlink1"><a name="0154qlink1">I'm surprised there is not more outcry against this. What this court decision
means is YOU don't own your life, the government does.</a> It can decide when you
die, whether in an execution chamber or on the battlefield, but you cannot. This
is purely a decision which openly says we are all enslaved to the government.</a>

<p>
<a href="0143.html#0151qlink2">&gt; &gt;2.  What does your second sentence mean? Were you suggesting that there may</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be some American states which are receptive to euthanasia? Please clarify.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think every single state has actually ruled against euthanasia</i><br>
<i>&gt; yet. Therefore, there's the possibility that one of those states might</i><br>
<i>&gt; not rule against euthanasia on a test case. The problem is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; federal government might come up with legislation that'd override</i><br>
<i>&gt; state laws and force state courts to revert or issue adverse rulings</i><br>
<i>&gt; in following cases.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In my view, the idea of a vessel or haven where a person may resort to</i><br>
<i>&gt; a merciful abridgement of bodily waste and suffering (euthanasia), and</i><br>
<i>&gt; also acquire some measure of hope for defeating and perhaps even</i><br>
<i>&gt; reversing the ravages of disease in the future (cryogenics), is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; notion worth following. Despite the enormous amount of research and</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort this endeavor might demand, I still think it's worth pursuing.</i><br>

<p>
Yes it is. Hoping to base such operations on land somewhere with a freindly or
bribable government is, IMHO too risky, as most penny ante countries will bend
over at the first cough from one or more of the big boys.
