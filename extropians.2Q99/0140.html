<i>&gt;</i><br>

<a name="0186qlink1">What if it's a replay of a Turing test?</a>

<p>
<a name="0186qlink2">The difficulty of a machine to pass a Turing test depends on who is testing
it.  Some people are more likely to be able to fool or reveal a machine into a
state of appearing non-sentient than others, but then again, maybe the machine
would prefer that, or in general, prefer to remain known as non-sentient.</a>

<p>
There are current AIs or other programs that can be very difficult to reveal
as such through a Turing test.  The slightest random tweak by a sentience can
make it impossible, but then this invalidates the Turing test.

<p>
This replay and record stuff seems ludicrous.  We are individual human beings
on the planet Earth orbiting our sun Sol, one of billions upon billions of
stars in our galaxy that is one of billions upon billions of galaxies in our
universe.  From most vantage points on Earth, the Earth seems quite flat.

<p>
Even if there was a super-AI that could access instantly all recorded
knowledge, and an Anthony Macroscope to review all past history for every
unrecorded physical event, there would still be things that it wouldn't and
couldn't know.  If the super-AI was sentient, that might simply be a state of
it possesing a sense of self-preservation, programming it to contemplate its
own existence is an extension of logic.

<p>
A super-AI could be an excellent judge, as it could be programmed to be
instilled with the highest sense of morals and ethics, along the lines of
jurimetrics.  If the super-AI goes wrong, then it would have to be
rehabilitated or replaced with a suitable one.  Whether multiple super-AIs
would be cooperative or competitive remains to be seen, probably a mixture as
we see in the most advanced form of sentience currently known to man, mankind.

<p>
Checks and balances on super-AIs shall be developed and maintained, perhaps by
independent AIs and humans in the loop.

<p>
Some might conjecture that humans are simply very complex machines, able to
fool themselves at Turing tests, but I would dispute that as I believe we have
some form of spirit or soul.
