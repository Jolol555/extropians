<p>
<a href="1310.html#1317qlink1">"Excludable property--resources that can only be used by one person at a</a><br>
time--are a simple fact of objective reality, and no amount of
hand-waving and pretty prose can change that.  "Hoarding" can
exacerbate shortages, and even create them, but to think that eliminating
hoarding will eliminate all shortages is childish fantasy.  Property
rights may or may not be the best way to allocate scarce resource; it is
definitely the best one so far tried.  There may be an even better
solution, but I doubt that denying the problem will lead to finding it."
