Cyborg Seeks Community

Meet one of the creators of wearable computing and join him in his search 
for like-minded folks to live in an augmented reality.

<p>
By Steve Mann

<p>
People find me peculiar. They think it’s odd that I spend most of my waking 
<a name="1491qlink2">hours wearing eight or nine Internet-connected computers sewn into my 
clothing and that I wear opaque wrap-around glasses day and night, inside 
and outdoors. They find it odd that to sustain wireless communications 
during my travels, I will climb to the hotel roof to rig my room with an 
antenna and Internet connection. They wonder why I sometimes seem detached 
and lost, but at other times I exhibit vast knowledge of their specialty. A 
physicist once said he felt that I had the intelligence of a dozen experts 
in his discipline; a few minutes later, someone else said they thought I was 
mentally handicapped.

<p>
Despite the peculiar glances I draw, I wouldn</a>’t live any other way. I have 
<a name="1491qlink3">melded technology with my person and achieved a higher state of awareness 
than would otherwise be possible. I see the world as images imprinted onto 
my retina by rays of light controlled by several computers, which in turn 
are controlled by cameras concealed inside my glasses.

<p>
Every morning I decide how I will see the world that day. Sometimes I give 
myself eyes in the back of my head. Other days I add a sixth sense, such as 
the ability to feel objects at a distance. If</a> I’m going to ride my bicycle, 
I’ll want to feel the cars and trucks pressing against my back, even when 
they are a few hundred feet away.

<p>
Things appear different to me than they do to other people. I see some items 
as hyperobjects that I can click on and bring to life. I can choose 
stroboscopic vision to freeze the motion of rotating automobile tires and 
see how many bolts are on the wheels of a car going over 60 miles per hour, 
as if it were motionless. I can block out the view of particular 
objects—sparing me the distraction, for example, of the vast sea of 
advertising around me.

<p>
I live in a videographic world, as if my entire life were a television show. 
And many people assume that by living my life through the screen, I do 
exactly what television leads us to do—tune out reality. In fact, WearComp 
<a name="1491qlink4">has quite the opposite effect: Visual filters help me concentrate on what is 
important, heightening my sensitivity and setting my imagination free. I do 
of course have occasion to remove my computational prostheses, as when I 
sleep, shower or splash around in the ocean.

<p>
In addition to having the Internet and massive databases and video at my 
beck and call most of the time, I am also connected to others. While I am 
grocery shopping, my wife</a>—who may be at home or in her office—sees exactly 
<a name="1491qlink5">what I see and helps me pick out vegetables. She can imprint images onto my 
retina while she is seeing what I see. I hope to add to the population of 
similarly equipped people; last fall at the University of Toronto, I taught 
what I believe to be the world</a>’s first course for cyborgs (see sidebar 
“School for Cyborgs”).

<p>
Much of my passion has been fueled by a desire to restore some balance of 
privacy in a world where individuals are increasingly affronted by 
government surveillance and corporate encroachments. In fact, one goal of my 
work was to challenge the notion of totalitarian video surveillance—the 
now-common practice of a corporate or governmental establishment wishing to 
know everything about everyone in the establishment while revealing nothing 
about itself. Many department stores, for example, use large numbers of 
hidden cameras and yet prohibit customers from taking pictures.

<p>
I attempted to draw attention to this phenomenon of unreciprocated video 
surveillance in Shooting Back, a documentary I made during my day-to-day 
life in several different countries over a period of many years. Whenever I 
found myself in a store or some other establishment with electronic eyes 
perusing the premises, I asked its management why they were taking pictures 
of me without my permission. They would typically ask me why I was so 
paranoid and tell me that only criminals are afraid of cameras. Of course I 
was covertly recording this response using my own hidden eyetap video 
camera. Then I would pull an ordinary camcorder out of my satchel and give 
them a chance to explain their position for the record. (The camcorder was 
simply a prop, of course, as the eyetap camera had been capturing the 
scene.) The same people who claimed that only criminals were afraid of 
cameras had an instantly paranoid (and sometimes violent) reaction to my 
camcorder. Shooting Back was, I believe, the first documentary to be 
transmitted in real time to the World Wide Web while it was shot. (Selected 
portions of Shooting Back may be viewed at

<p>
Ahead of My Time

<p>
Growing up during the 1960s and early 1970s, I always seemed to be creating 
things before their time. I grew up in Hamilton, Ontario—a city on the 
western tip of Lake Ontario about 100 kilometers from Toronto. I came by 
this inclination naturally; during the early 1950s, my father had built what 
was perhaps the first wearable radio. (He had pursued radio as a hobby since 
his childhood.) He had taught me quite a bit about electronic circuits by 
the time I started kindergarten. As a young child, I removed the head from a 
portable battery-powered dictating machine and replaced it with the head 
from a high-fidelity audio cassette deck. From this cassette transport 
mechanism, I built a system that enabled me to listen to music while walking 
around. While many people scoffed at this invention, I found it nice to be 
able to drown out background music while shopping, to assert my own idea of 
personal space, and to defend myself from theft of my solitude by the 
department stores with their Muzak.

<p>
In my teens I founded a concept of mediated reality, which I called 
“lightspace.” The goal of lightspace was to experience an altered perception 
of visual reality by exploring a large range of possible forms of 
illumination while observing a scene or object from different viewpoints. My 
work with lightspace led to the invention of my wearable computer. My desire 
to create photographic instruments that would function as true extensions of 
my mind and body—and my desire to control these photographic instruments in 
new ways—created a need for the ability to program complex sequences of 
events.

<p>
I began to take this matter seriously, building a digital computer from a 
large number of electronic components salvaged from an old telephone 
switching computer. I did much of this experimentation in the basement of a 
television repair shop where I spent much of my childhood as a volunteer, 
fixing TV sets. In this shop I built up a great deal of knowledge about 
electronic circuits.

<p>
The result of my early efforts was, in the early 1970s, a family of wearable 
computers I called “WearComp0.” Sometimes I took these cumbersome prototypes 
outside in search of spaces dark enough to explore the altered perception of 
visual reality I could create using portable battery-powered light sources. 
People would cross the street to avoid me, not knowing what to make of what 
must have looked to them like an alien creature. The rig was physically a 
burden, weighing as much or more than I did. After wearing one of these 
encumbrances from sundown (when it got dark enough to use them) to sunrise, 
my feet would be swollen, blistered and bleeding.

<p>
I continued to refine WearComp0 and its evolutionary successor, WearComp1. 
After much tinkering, I came up with WearComp2—my first system that truly 
qualified as a wearable computer in the sense that it was not just a special 
purpose device. WearComp2 was field programmable, with a full-function input 
device (a keyboard and joystick for cursor control both built into the 
handle of an electronic flashgun), text and graphical displays, sound 
recording and playback (crude, home-brew analog-to-digital and 
digital-to-analog converters), and a wireless data connection to provide 
links to other computers. I completed this system in 1981, before most of 
the world realized that computers could be portable, much less wearable.

<p>
Though an advance over my earlier prototype, WearComp2 was still a burden to 
lug. I wanted to reduce its bulk and make it look more normal. This goal led 
me in 1982 to experiment with building components directly into clothing. I 
learned how to make flexible circuits that could be embedded into ordinary 
fabric. This work enabled me to make versions of WearComp that were not only 
more comfortable to walk around in but also less off-putting to others.

<p>
In spite of these advances, my life as a cyborg remained mostly solitary. I 
did connect quite literally (by serial data cable) with an understanding 
woman during my freshman year at McMaster University in my hometown of 
Hamilton. We faced unusual challenges in this configuration, such as having 
to choose which public restroom to use when we were joined. Thinking back, I 
imagine we must have made a comical sight, trying to negotiate doorways 
without snagging the cable that tethered us together.

<p>
Such relationships were rare, and it was seldom that I could get others to 
wear my seemingly strange contraptions. Many people were unable to get past 
my technological shell, which they apparently found more than a little odd. 
Still, multimediated reality had provided me with a unique vision of the 
world, and by the mid-1980s I had a following of people on the fringes of 
society who shared (or at least appreciated) my vision. I was invited to 
shoot pictures for album covers and hair ads. By 1985, I began to realize 
that it wasn’t just the finished photographs people wanted; they also seemed 
to enjoy watching me take the pictures. Often I would be shooting in large 
warehouses, with audiences of hundreds of people. I began to realize that I 
had become a cyborg performance artist. By the end of the 1980s, however, I 
found myself yearning to return to my more substantive childhood passions 
for science, mathematics and electrical engineering.

<p>
While at McMaster, I added biosensors to the WearComp so that it could 
monitor my heart rate (as well as the full EKG waveform) and other 
physiological signals. I also invented the “vibravest”—a garment studded 
<a name="1491qlink6">with radar transceivers and vibrating elements. Wearing this vest made 
objects at a distance feel as if they were pressing against my body. I could 
close my eyes and walk down the hallway, confident that any wall or other 
obstacle would be felt as warning vibrations on the appropriate side of the 
vest. By sparing myself from the cognitive load of processing all that 
visual information, I found I was able to think more clearly.

<p>
In 1991, I brought my inventions to MIT as a PhD student. As a cyborg, 
uprooting myself from Canada was a formidable task, since I had installed my 
cyberbody in Canada over a period of many years. Going to MIT was a sudden 
move of my extended self.

<p>
First, I secretly climbed up onto the rooftops of buildings around the city 
to put in place the wireless data communications infrastructure I had 
brought with me from Canada. I had to quickly deploy my base stations at the 
top of elevator shafts or anywhere else I could find warm dry places.</a> This 
way, whenever I wanted an Internet connection, these gateways would be ready 
to send the data to me, no matter where I was—even if I was in a basement or 
riding on the subway.

<p>
Although I kept in touch with my family through cyberspace, my first two 
years at MIT were lonely times IRL—in real life. I was, after all, the only 
person there with a wearable computer. Then in 1993, at the request of a 
fellow student, a local engineer named Doug Platt built a wearable system. I 
was no longer the only cyborg at MIT.

<p>
It took some years to get other cyborgs at MIT, thus enabling the beginnings 
of a sense of community. Although I never succeeded in getting a large 
community outfitted with my high-speed packet radio systems, the cellular 
telephones that began to emerge provided another answer to the problem of 
connectivity.

<p>
By the end of 1995, my work was attracting serious academic interest. I was 
asked to write an article about my work for IEEE Computer, a publication of 
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ Computer Society. I 
<a name="1491qlink7">also proposed an academic symposium on wearables and was referred to T. 
Michael Elliott, executive director of the Computer Society. I figured that 
such a conference would legitimize the field, which until then had consisted 
in many people</a>’s minds of “Steve, that crazy guy running around with a 
camera on his head.” Elliott was enthusiastic about the idea and in 1996 the 
Computer Society responded with an overwhelming “yes.” This marked a turning 
point in my acceptance by my professional peers.

<p>
More than 700 people attended this first IEEE-sponsored symposium on 
wearable computing, held in Cambridge, Mass., in October 1997. A gala 
“Wearables” event the following day drew 3,000 people. In that same year I 
<a name="1491qlink8">received my doctorate from MIT in wearable computing. This was a gratifying 
culmination: I had turned a childhood hobby and passion into an MIT project, 
the topic of a conference, and a PhD dissertation.

<p>
This past year I returned to Canada to pursue my work at the University of 
Toronto. Why Toronto? I had lived there in the mid-1980s, and the city had 
seemed very</a> “cyborg-friendly.” I had sensed there a cosmopolitan diversity 
<a name="1491qlink9">as well as a genuine warmth and openness that contrasted with the more 
cyborg-hostile and tense atmosphere of some large U.S. cities.

<p>
Wearing Well

<p>
Although I spent many years developing WearComp in relative isolation, I 
welcome efforts to commercialize wearable computers. At the vanguard is 
Xybernaut, based in Fairfax, Va. Xybernaut</a>’s latest model is being 
manufactured by Sony, indicating that the Japanese electronics giant has an 
interest in what some believe will become the Walkman of computing. Last 
May, Xybernaut organized its own conference on wearable computing (and 
invited me to give the keynote address). I may also begin to license some 
embodiments of my original WearComp, as well as many of my more recent 
innovations, to companies who want to manufacture commercial systems. I 
think it will be especially important to make the cyborg outfit less 
cumbersome—something that’s long been a goal of mine. My latest version is 
<a name="1491qlink10">quite sleek, and looks just like ordinary bifocal eyeglasses, with the 
eyetap point hidden along the cut line. Even when fully rigged, I can still 
play an acceptable game of squash.

<p>
I realize that some people see me and my invention as a potential 
</a>threat—like the Borg of Star Trek fame: “You will be assimilated.” Clearly, 
there are important philosophical issues to be explored. Not only is there 
the danger of the technology being used to monitor people to make them into 
obedient productive cyborgs, but there is also the potential that people 
will become too dependent on this technology. My goal as a responsible 
inventor and engineer, however, has always been to encourage the development 
and manufacture of wearable computers as a means of personal, not 
institutional, empowerment. That will make worthwhile all the obstacles and 
challenges I have faced during my more than 20 years of developing this 
technology.

<p>
I hope that if I bring WearComp to market, anyone who wishes to will 
eventually be able to become a cyborg. We’ll live in a collaborative 
computer-mediated reality that will allow us to no longer need to 
distinguish between cyberspace and the real world. And then this cyborg will 
have lots of company.
