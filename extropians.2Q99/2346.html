There are extreme antigun voices and extreme progun voices, just 
like ther are extreme antiabortion voices and extreme prochoice 
voices, and then there's the sensible center, where I reside on this 
issue.  To further draw the parallel, both extreme antiabortion and 
extreme progun voices (the two "civil rights" issues of the 
conservative right) assume an absolute position (no abortion, even 
one minute after conception; no gun restriction, even for the insane, 
underage or criminally violent) and warn, using the same flawed 
analogies from the same historical precedents (typically naziism 
and antebellum slavery in the american south) to argue, by means 
of slippery slopes and dominoes, of losses of personal freedom of 
biblical proportions if their absolutistic standard is compromised 
one iota.  On the other side, both extreme prochoice and extreme 
antigun voices do much the same thing, and draw similar, and 
similarly flawed analogies, to argue in defence of an unrestricted 
right to partial-birth abortion for any reason or for none, or the 
banning of all guns for all citizens and the elimination of sport 
hunting.  My position is kinda like Roe vs. Wade, in which the right 
to abortion is connected to the level of development of the fetus.  
No restrictions are permitted in the first trimester, some in the 
second, and a lot in the third.  For me, the right to keep and bear 
arms should be connected to the level of personal responsibility 
demonstrated by each individual.  Any responsible adult should be 
able to purchase firearms.<a name="2371qlink1">  The names of those who do not meet 
the criteria of responsibility (who have been convicted of violent 
criminal offences, spouse and/or child abuse, or judged mentally 
unfit by a legitimate psychiatric review) should be kept in a national 
purchase-prohibited registry, AND NO OTHER NAMES.  If you can 
prove (say, with your birth certificate) that you are of age (18 
seems reasonable to me) and your name does not appear on the 
registry, your purchase should go through.  These registries should 
apply to, and be accessible by, gun dealers, gun shows, pawn 
shop owners, flea market owners, and any other place where 
weapons may be reasonably expected to be purchased by people 
unknown to the seller.  Those who knowingly sell a firearm to 
someone on the prohibited registry should be prosecuted for the 
sale, and held legally liable for any gun-related crime the buyer 
subsequently commits.  Those who have these matters pending or 
proceeding in court should have their names provisionally added</a> to 
the registry, to be removed upon acquittal or judgment of mental 
fitness.  All decisions should be appealable, but the names should 
remain on the list until the appeals are decided.  Trigger locks 
should be required to be sold with every firearm, and if a shooting 
subsequently occurs where the shooter has taken the weapon from 
the owner without consent and the lock was not installed, the 
owner should be held liable for neglect.  If the trigger lock was in 
place but subsequently picked or broken off, the owner should not 
be held liable.
