Ok, so the definition of Cold Turkey is debatable. I'd say, when you stop -
its not using substitutes or patches or whatever else you can think of. One
day, I was smoking, the next I wasn't.

<p>
I'd never heard of a gene relating to addiction. That is fascinating. So, in
the future, as we are reprogramming our work force, we can genetically
enhance the chances of them being alcholics or drug addicts? Gee wizz, when
will the singularity arrive? before we totally fuck ourselves I hope.

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; "addictive personality gene".  I've indulged in a number of substances in</i><br>
