My business partner likes to 'test' stun guns on himself at gun shows -
especially when there's a big knot of people watching the seller's
demonstration of inch long hot sparks. The biggest effect I have seen him
register is that his smile sometimes gets a bit tighter.

<p>
I think these gadgets have more deterrent effect due to the noisy and
flashy arcs than their actual effect - but then I have no personal
experience of their effect, being morally opposed to receiving ANY
electrical shocks I can't avoid...

<p>
The amount of power needed to get a real 'stun' might border on lethal
levels. Pain might be a better deterrent than actual 'stun' - this can be
obtained with current limited 400 Hz AC at less than 100 volts. This I know
- having gotten afoul of aircraft AC power more than once.

<p>
Any electrical device of this nature carries with it the risk of death to
some individuals, however. We are a long way from Star Trek yet.
