<p>
I would like to say a few words on Natural Law and property rights.

<p>
There is a great confusion as to what Natural Law is all about. Some
interpret  it as a physical law, with the same level of predictory
power and the same level of formalism as e.g., Newton's law of gravitation.
That is mistaken. Natural law is a theory which predicts that human
societies will tend to have certain legal (and moral) structures in
common, namely a basic respect for induvidual property rights, both in
person
<br>
and in material things. The evidence is, I think, indisputable. You will
find no
<br>
society where it has been legal to kill a fellow citizen for no reason. Of
course, all
<br>
societies have had slightly different definitions of what a "fellow citizen"
is, but virtually
<br>
all  societies have sooner or later evolved institutions that punish murder,
kidnapping,
<br>
theft etc. Even Nazi Germany did not allow just any German to kill or steal
from any other German.

<p>
Natural Law theory further predicts that the harder you try to suppress the
natural institutions
<br>
of basic property rights the more violence you need to employ to succeed,
and then
<br>
you will still only succeed for a time (witness the fate of communism).
For a peaceful and orderly society to survive you need a certain
institutional
<br>
recognition of property rights.

<p>
Natural Law theory doesn't prove libertarians right about "the government
that governs least
<br>
governs best", but it does indicate that government must respect and support
certain fundamental institutions, namely property.

<p>
