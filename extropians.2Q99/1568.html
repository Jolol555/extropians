<a name="1577qlink1">Yes, a huge system is a visible target if there are nasty people
around. Whether this is a big problem or not is a function of the
number of nasties, the offensive strength they can wield and the
defensive strength of the jupiter brain. A complicated problem.</a>

<p>
But a jupiter-sized brain is not likely unless there is a strong need
for very fast and dense communications. A more likely structure
(assuming just molecular nanotechnology) is a cluster of
asteroid-sized systems. And distribution, redundancy and
error-correction would make it much less vulnerable.

<p>
:-) Actually, there are a limit to how small brains can become. At the
very least Bekenstein's bound on the information density, but more
likely due to stuff like quantum noise and physical properties of the
materials we can get. And once this is reached, the brains will start
to grow. Whether they ever become macroscopic (and somebody can ever
afford the luxury of having a jupiter brain for itself rather than
distributing across the networks) is another matter. 

<p>
<a href="1534.html#1568qlink3">&gt; Anyway, surely it would play hell with your neck muscles.</a><br>

"The new Trapezius Pro 2.0 can be customized for all brain models,
from the BioClassic to the Chandrasekar. Thanks to its unique
neutronium cervical reinforcement and magnetically stabilized fibers
it will not be troubled even when visiting high gravity environments."
