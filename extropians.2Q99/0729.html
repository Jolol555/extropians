<a name="0734qlink1">Picture this, they have shown in the laboratory, supposedly, that electrons or
atoms can be teleported.  Then again, they had "cold fusion" ten years ago.

<p>
Anyways, as soon as we get past the barriers of space-time in a similar manner
as teleportation, we could teleport mass for energy rendering, probably a long
time before something like that would be safe for yourself or a houseplant.</a>

When I say extra-dimensional, I mean representing elements of dimensions beyond
those we encounter comprehensibly every day, one through four.  One, two, and
three dimensions are x, y, and z, and four is time.

<p>
<a name="0734qlink2">Theoretically, no matter where in space-time, there is an infinite number of
higher dimensions.  So, at an arbitrary coordinate of (0,0,0), at arbitrary
time 0, there is a fifth dimension ranging from -oo to oo, where oo is scalar
infinity, and that coordinate in space-time might be at any coordinate in the
fifth dimension. etcetera.  This could mean that there are an infinite number
of alternate space-times for each point in space-time.</a>

<p>
I write this and feel it is true, intuitively, but have no proof, and the
system is ill-defined.

<p>
Alternately, there is only one space, and for that matter, only one point in
time, now.  I believe this is not the case.

<p>
<a name="0734qlink3">Once this system is better defined, and we have developed tools to interact
with and work with it, then a large variety of "special effects" will be able
to be tapped.</a>
