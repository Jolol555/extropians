Your analysis seems plausible.  But the key thing it suggests to me
in our context is that flamewars indicate that to many list members the 
salience of the issue-groups they flame about is less than the salience of 
the list as a group, or of a wider community of intellectuals.  

<p>
Someone who cares little about their general reputation among this group, 
or their reputation as a thinker in general, but who does care about their
acceptance among issue-oriented groups, feels free to flame here.  In
contrast, those wishing to show their attachment to this list group as
a whole should act calmly and civily here, while those wishing to gain a 
reputation as intelligent contributors should be receptive to my 
suggestion to write articles.
