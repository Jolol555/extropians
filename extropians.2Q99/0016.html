Well, yesterday was the big day. 100% of government mission-critical systems
were going to be compliant with nine months for testing to ensure they really
were... 

<p>
The good news is that 92% of mission-critical systems were claimed to be
compliant.

<p>
The bad news is that the way they got 92% of the critical systems compliant 
was to redefine more than 1/3 of the mission-critical systems as no longer
critical.

<p>
Y2K is just business as usual down government way...
