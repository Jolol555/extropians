<i>&gt; &gt; I have advocated denying gun ownership to (once</i><br>

<i>&gt; This seems also a list of those most likely to disregard whatever laws may stand</i><br>
<i>&gt; between them and their goals.  It may have the effect of forcing them to obtain</i><br>
<i>&gt; their guns from the black market or through theft; perhaps the stupidest ones</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be caught in the attempt.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Well, there's no reason to prevent gun sales to the law-abiding and 
responsible among us.  It's the dangerous ones which SHOULD 
concern us.

<a href="2201.html#2210qlink2">&gt; Don't get me wrong, I don't wish to see those prone to initiating violence heavily</a><br>
<i>&gt; armed, but then neither do I wish to see them roaming at large, armed or not (if</i><br>
<i>&gt; we have to discuss whether they should be armed we have already arrived at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong question).  I am concerned, however, with what the political process may do</i><br>
<i>&gt; to us in process of turning your "common sense" into the usual incomprehensible</i><br>
<i>&gt; mish-mash.  Politicians seem generally not nearly as concerned with the probable</i><br>
<i>&gt; outcomes of their actions as they are with being seen "taking action", which IMHO</i><br>
<i>&gt; is what is driving the recent spurt of gun-banning proposals.  Since their general</i><br>
<i>&gt; response to failure is to keep doing whatever produced the failure, but harder</i><br>
<i>&gt; (ref: War On Some Drugs, gov't schools, public housing, welfare, etc etc), I do</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe the "slippery slope" is a real concern.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Well, I'll campaign against you to pass the reasonable, and 
campaign just as hard with you to defeat the unreasonable.
