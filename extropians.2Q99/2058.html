Joe, I agree that keeping weapons out of the hands of convicted
felons is often a good idea. Many laws exist which purport to
support that aim, but they seem to be ineffective.  Do you have any
useful suggestions on how those laws could be enforced such that
they have some useful positive impact?</a>

<p>
<a name="2178qlink2">I gather the impression that, unlike many "ban the gun" advocates,
you don't mind gun ownership by non-felons, and you own weapons
yourself.  Sadly it appears that most mass shooters are not
convicted felons *at the time they commit their attacks*, and
banning the possession of guns by _potential_ shooters would require
massive infringements of civil rights- for who can identify a
potential shooter?  Psychological screening for firearms purchases? 
The possibilities for political abuse of such a system would</a> be
large.
