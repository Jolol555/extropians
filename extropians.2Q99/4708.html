     I got this on another list. I was surprised not to see it on this one, 
so...

<i> &gt; Real Computers Don't 'Squish'</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; Computers are typically made from silicon, or occasionally from some </i><br>
other
<br>
<i> &gt; specialized material, but whatever their base, today's computers are made</i><br>
<i> &gt; out of good, old-fashioned, solid-state components that come out of a</i><br>
<i> &gt; nice, clean chip foundry. Real computers don't "squish." Real computers</i><br>
<i> &gt; don't have to be fed (except with electrons) -- right?</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; Well, some scientists in Atlanta have now demonstrated a different, very</i><br>
<i> &gt; organic variation on our nice "normal" computers -- a computer built out</i><br>
<i> &gt; of leech neurons.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; OK, it's not quite equal to a good Pentium, but when a group of these</i><br>
<i> &gt; neurons is stimulated in a particular way, they actually do math.</i><br>
<i> &gt; Correctly.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; Brought to our attention by U.K. RCFoC reader Donovan Taylor and others,</i><br>
<i> &gt; the leech neurons apparently taught themselves to solve the problem of</i><br>
<i> &gt; adding two numbers. According to the June 2 BBC News, when individual</i><br>
<i> &gt; neurons are stimulated in a way to represent numbers, other linked </i><br>
neurons
<br>
<i> &gt; then provide the sum. And this is different from the computers we're used</i><br>
<i> &gt; to in more ways than just being based on carbon</i><br>
<i> &gt; instead of silicon.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; "The device the team has built can 'think for itself' because the leech</i><br>
<i> &gt; neurons are able to form their own connections from one to another,"</i><br>
<i> &gt; Taylor said. "Normal silicon computers only make the connections they are</i><br>
<i> &gt; told to by the programmer. "The line graph readouts showed the neurones</i><br>
<i> &gt; holding the numbers 2 and 3, and when they linked [added] the numbers, </i><br>
the
<br>
<i> &gt; readout showed real activity. You had to take the research team's word</i><br>
<i> &gt; that the result was a 5, but there was a reaction to the numeric </i><br>
stimuli."
<br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; Well, that's certainly interesting if we take the results of this very</i><br>
<i> &gt; early "wetware" work at face value, but it's hardly significant -- is it?</i><br>
<i> &gt; I mean, what good is a petri dish that can add 3 and 2?</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; Of course, I do remember people saying exactly those things about the</i><br>
<i> &gt; first digital computers that only added 1 and 1.</i><br>
