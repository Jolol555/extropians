I really must object to this.  Your two brain systems have massive
differences that are (to me) obviously directly involved with consciousness.

predictable, we don't no what it will do.  The second brain is predictable,
it only does what we tell it to do.  The first brain functions autonomously,
and will continue to do so after everybody leaves.  The second brain only
functions while being controlled by external brains.  If everybody leaves,
it becomes inert.  The first brain can think up new ideas.  The second brain
can only think up what someone else already thought up and copies into the
brain.  The first brain can respond to new situations.  The second brain
will only respond to situations that have already occurred and have been
recorded.

<p>
I don't see how these brains can even be considered to be behaving
similarly.  One seems to meet every definition of consciousness, while the
other seems to miss every definition of consciousness.  Any appearance of
similarity between the brains is superficial.

<p>
To be honest, I don't see how you can really believe that the second brain
is as conscious as the first, except for the sake of argument.  You can't
have a conversation with the second brain.  It can't perform any function
without someone else doing it for it first.  It couldn't be submitted to
pass a real Turing Test.  It can't answer the phone and talk.  It can never
tell you something you didn't already know.  Can you really tell me that if
I were going to upload you, that you would have no preference as to whether
you were the first brain or the second brain?  I think the real-world answer
is obvious, and you are deliberately ignoring the obvious to try to make
your argument work out.
