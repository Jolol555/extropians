As long as humans are connected with a physical state of existence, there will
be interaction with three dimensional objects (property). As long as humans live
in societies, there will be a need for delineation of private vs. public
property rights.

<p>
Under current conditions of supply and demand gaps, the rational focus should be
on maximizing production capabilities. History has shown democratic-capitalistic
societies to be the most productive at the same.

<p>
Under future conditions of unlimited production capability, the focus should
shift toward maximizing satisfaction, which is a personal choice. There could be
communities with varying levels of private vs. public property ownership,
whereby each individual could reside in a community that suits their preference.

<p>
I personally would prefer a community that respects the sanctity of individual
toothbrush ownership.
