Hmm, what female writers and thinkers have influenced me the most?

<p>
I would guess Marie Curie is on top of my list (or at least most
easily remembered). I read her biography as a young boy, and it really
helped me understand what scientific work is about (except wearing a
white coat and mixing bubbling liquids). Her personal dedication was
impressive.

<p>
Linda Nagata has already been mentioned, I really enjoyed
the... "texture" of her novels; the way she described the more subtle
effects of the advanced technology such as how nanotech would actually
feel, or the smells from it.

<p>
I also look forward to read Virginia Postrel's _The Future and Its
Enemies_, I hope to get the book this week.

<p>
Then there is also a certain Natasha Vita-More, but I guess she needs
no further presentation here... :-)
