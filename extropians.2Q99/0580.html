On Damien Broderick's new book, "The Last Mortal Generation":
I just finished reading it - very enlightening, thankyou Damien! In
fact, it's how I found out about transhumanism, then extropians, then
this list.

<p>
<a name="0582qlink1">I especially loved the chapter about Black Holists, mostly for the tone
of the discussion. I'm not usually one for wholesale bagging of people,
but when the execution is so artful...</a>

<hr>


<p>
Actually, I'll ask an unrelated question of people at this point. 

<p>
I decided quite a while ago that I would like to live a bit longer than
three score and ten. I was convinced that science will be able to
deliver this before it becomes an issue for me. Then I found out about
Damien's book, because I'd been using the same phrase (last mortal
generation), and someone pointed me to the book.

<p>
<a name="0587qlink1">I have found that this has occupied my thoughts more and more, and so my
conversation. In fact, I'm probably becoming an immortality bore. The
problem I have is, that when I'm blabbing away about living in the last
generation of mortals or the first generation of immortals, depending on
luck basically (and a lot of people's hard work, sorry to all you out
there), I suddenly get quite embarrased if I'm talking to or am nearby
an elderly person.</a>

<p>
<a name="0598qlink1">How, after all, can it sound? I'm in my late twenties, and talking about
how it's a travesty that people die, a pointless waste, and a violation
of human rights which must be rectified, probably in the later half of
next century, so I'll have to hang on tooth&amp;nail to life until my
mortality problem can be fixed up. Blah blah blah, I'm sure many of us
go on with the same stuff.

<p>
<a name="0582qlink2">How insulting is this to a person of, say, 80 years? Really, I'm writing
them</a> of, as part of the doomed past, so near and yet so far. It makes me
feel like a heel, and yet my opinions about immortality (I love the
loaded words) has not changed. 

<p>
<a name="0583qlink1">What does one do? Keep it to oneself? Go on regardless? Tell such a
person "Sorry you are going to die, bummer eh"?</a>

<p>
<a name="0582qlink3">What do other list members think about this? I'd be *especially*
interested in the opinions of older members.
