I don't know about Eliezer's claim, but the brain is definitely
changing at this age. I wouldn't say it becomes less capable, it is
rather a qualitative change in ability.

Very young brains are extremely plastic and quick learners - great for
learning languages perfectly, understanding a complex world and
generally building up a general person. The drawback is quick
forgetting and a tendency for irrelevant stuff to overwhelm. As we
grow up, our brains become less plastic, which is of course irritating
when you want to learn stuff but also makes our memories more stable
and enables more critical thinking. They are by now well informed and
trained, which means skills can be applied to a much larger extent
than earlier. Different mental ages have different advantages and
drawbacks.
