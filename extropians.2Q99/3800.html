Personality and disease is interesting. There is rather a lot of literature
on the so-called toxic personality ( and the hypothesis that stress hormones
destroy neurons), links suggesting that introverts and neurotic people get
less cancer, others saying more, or more heart disease.

<p>
I feel that most of these data are pointing to a role of hostility (bad for
your heart) and depression (bad for everything). My retrospective advice?

  <li>  Come from a K strategy group selected for long life, altruism, and high
parental investment (which requires parents to be alive, which means you
live longer).

  <li>  Don't get depression
    Vaillant, G. E.,  (1998). Natural history of male psychological
    health, XIV: Relationship of mood disorder vulnerability to
    physical health. , 155: 184-191.

  <li>  Don't do depressing stuff like getting divorced.

    Criqui, M. H.,  (1997). Parental divorce: Effects on individual
    behavior and longevity. , 73: 381-391.

  <li>  Oh yes, and if you are male, marry someone as far younger
   than yourself as you can find.
