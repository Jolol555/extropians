While 'greek fire' existed during the Roman era, and gunpowder was invented at a
similar time in China, the gun and the cannon were both invented in the depths
of the dark ages, as were many weapons of war and peace.<a name="2517qlink1"> The only thing that was
dark about the dark ages was that centralized statutory government tyranny was
replaced by distributed, random, meaningless petty tyranny.</a> Some technologies
were lost, like the art of electroplating, as well as much astronomical
knowledge, however that was just in europe. The prejudices of Gibbon's "Rise and
Fall of the Roman Empire" have done much to promote the supposed 'benefits' of a
strong government in the intelligentsia, despite much of his interpretation of
'history' being debunked.
