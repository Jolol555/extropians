I'm fairly certain that The Matrix was pitched as a trilogy, like the Scream 
films and Star Wars. Some of the actors in The Matrix (and the new SW eps) 
have signed 3 film deals, as a pre-condition of being in one of the films. 
But the new films were dependant on the success of the first (and the third 
dependant on the second). Even George Lucas has said that if the new SW ep 
bombs, there will not be any more ( not that we have ANYTHING to worry about).
