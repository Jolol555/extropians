Do guns imply violence, or merely the intention of the carrier to meet
attempted violence with equal force?

sign that the means to do so are present? Talk is cheap. Having the gun
present may be all that is needed to prevent a situation where violence
would occur.</a>

<a name="2211qlink3">Absolute agreement with your stepfather's advice. I have taught my children
just that, and I hope that they never need to actually pull a gun anywhere
other than the target range.

<p>
Pulling a gun is very different than carrying one. It's the difference
between being ABLE to shout threats and actually doing so. Unless someone
is considering doing you harm, why should they be intimidated by the fact
that you are obviously armed?
