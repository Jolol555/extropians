Hey, this thread isn't META at all (although this comment is)...

<i>&gt; &gt; you are in favor of ANY such measures, please enunciate them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and your willingness to work for passage of them.  Your comments</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; concerning mandatory gun ownership, except for those who would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be willing to stigmatize themselves in a manner not unlike those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; who refuse to pray or stand for the Pledge of Allegiance in school,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; from this very post, are below.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As opposed to gun owners being stigmatized? As a veteran, I know which I</i><br>
<i>&gt; prefer. Let the treasonous little pricks get a taste of their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; medecine. Like it or not, we are ALL part of the militia. It says so</i><br>
<i>&gt; right there. Are you conscripted to vote, to speak, to freely associate,</i><br>
<i>&gt; to serve on juries, to be judged by your peers? If you were born here,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you take it for granted, maybe you weren't told or taught about those</i><br>
<i>&gt; things. If you immigrated, you were definitely taught these things as</i><br>
<i>&gt; part of your citizenship naturalization. Your freedom of choice with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2nd amendment is whether or not to be a Concientious Objector. You can</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep your status private for all I care.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; yeah it sucked you got drafted and sent to Nam, but hey, if you wanted</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be a citizen, you did it, didn't you? You didn't run off to Canada,</i><br>
<i>&gt; so you weren't totally against the idea of America, but if you didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the desire and the guts to be a CO, you picked up a rifle and did</i><br>
<i>&gt; your dirty work just like everyone else. You risked getting killed or</i><br>
<i>&gt; wounded like the rest of us. I personally don't care if you do your</i><br>
<i>&gt; service to your country in the Marines or the Peace Corps, but I beleive</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the core of my being that we will only remain the nation we are so</i><br>
<i>&gt; long as all give something of themselves to their country, and follow</i><br>
<i>&gt; the old Roman Republic maxim of "come home with your shield or on it, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't come home at all."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only measures I support are already in place, and have passed</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitutional muster. Those statutes that don't should no longer be</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered by rational Americans.</i><br>

<a name="3315qlink7"><i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The concern about proper training is a valid</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one that even the founding fathers recognised, which is why</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the term "well</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regulated" is in the 2nd amendment, which in that day and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; age meant well trained</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and skilled. Its IMHO everyone's constitutional DUTY to learn</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to responsibly use</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weapons because of this, unless they have a religious type</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of reticence against</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violence even in defense, as is provided for Conscientious</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Objectors, then they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are exempted.</i><br>
