<p>
Okay.  That is not how you came across.

<p>
<i>&gt; My point was that I think that the idea that everyone on the planet should not</i><br>
<i>&gt; use a specific combination of sounds just because one small group in one region of the planet</i><br>
<i>&gt; finds it offensive is rather ludicrous. Should I go tell my Native American freinds at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Athabascan Backcountry Outfitters that they have to change their company's acronym because its</i><br>
&gt; offensive to other indigenous people on the other side of the planet? They'll throw me in the<br>
&gt; lake in a heartbeat, and start using offensive descriptives of me at that point....<br>


<p>
Sure, but this isn't what I was saying.  Would you use such a term to
people who find it personally offensive? I hope not.

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Always, and, BTW, people who killfile usually killfile people who use rude, insulting and</i><br>
<i>&gt; offensive language the most. Hint hint.</i><br>


<p>
Like I care. hint. Hint. Hint.


<p>
In fact, if you did killfile me, you wouldn't respond to my posts and I
wouldn't get sucked into these stupid arguments with you.  Hmm, maybe
killfiling me would be a good idea....
