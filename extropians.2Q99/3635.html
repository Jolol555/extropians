Max!! Ouch... me cry now. 
<br>
I am pretty surprised you reacted to my free choice with that jab about the 
police!   : (    In fact boggled. In fact deeply hurt. Your implications are 
over reactions. 
<br>
I haven't said "by not posting to this list, I was denied freedom of speech", 
or that censoring this list represents state-installed institutionalized 
censorship! (a censor defines as: " a person who examines literature (film, 
&lt;etc&gt;) to remove or prohibit anything unsuitable). 
I did not suggest you were censoring *me*, only the list.
I actually would prefer not to have had to been dragged back to the list, but 
since you posted publicly, here's my reason:
I said I was going... based my own feeling.  My own choice... 
It could be respected as I respect your decision to censor your own list. 
You are as free to censor your list as you are to ask people not to smoke in 
your house, or poop on your rug = ) 
<br>
However, I feel that "creative" ideas flourish only where nothing is off 
topic. It has to do with my theories that creativity is non-linear and 
associative.  For example: Eugene's "smart" guns were very creative. Possibly 
using that chemistry, another idea may spur another..  Next you may decise 
racism isn't an extropian subject, and thanks to Anders' story , I am 
considering doing a series using the bizzare colors and landforms of 
Dr.Suess...
<br>
That's why list censorship doesn't work for me, and it in fact bugs me! 
...or, maybe it's just an adolescent dislike of authority.... 
= ) hey,  don't worry about ME calling the police, they represent more of the 
same thing!
