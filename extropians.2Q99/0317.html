Hi!,

<p>
<a name="0334qlink1">I just wanted to say hello.  Recently I have been reading all I can on 
the net about cryonics, transhumanism, extropianism, nanotech, and 
future forecasting.  And I have learned about the notable people in 
the movements such as Drexler, Sandberg, Ettinger, Merkle, Platt, and 
More.  I find it all very thrilling!  The width and breadth of 
Ander's Transhuman website is incredible.  The concepts you espouse 
are truly mind boggling.  I have read "The Engines of Creation" and 
<br>
"The Prospects for Immortality" so far, and look forward to reading <br>
"Create/Uncreate" by Natasha-Vita More.      <br>

<p>
<a name="0321qlink1">I am only thirty-one, but do not feel I have gotten my "money's worth" 
out of my youth due to physical and psychosocial problems that I have. 
 I am not goodlooking (not ugly either, and I am tall, 6'1 but only 
145 lbs.!), and grew up poor so woman largely ignore me compared to 
the physically attractive and $$$ endowed males.  I want my 
chance, and by the time I have a degree, decent job and money</a> for 
cosmetic surgery my youth will be gone.</a> 

<p>
I had a cool phone conversation with Charles Platt several years ago. 
 At the time I had no idea who he actually was.  I recently emailed 
him and got back a warm reply, he actually remembered who I was.  He 
has certainly been busy with Cryocare.  I was very impressed by his 
contest held in Omni; a better person could not have been found to 
give the prize of a cryonics membership.

<p>
The caliber, and intellect of those committed to extropianism and 
cryonics impresses me.  The scientific discussions I encounter in the 
extropian digest sometimes go over my head but I am learning a lot.  
Though the arguements about gun control and air crashes do drag on 
just a little!

<p>
If I were not a financially strapped student I would love to attend 
Extro 4!  It would be very cool to meet all the people that I have 
been reading about on the net.  And the lectures must all be 
excellent.  One day I will make it, if not this time.  One problem 
about living in Alaska is that you can't just hop in a car or bus and 
a few hours later be in another state!  But you understand that being 
in England, but then you must have your own conferences.

<p>
I live in Anchorage and attend the University of Alaska Anchorage as 
a sophomore.  My major is history at this point, though I have thought 
of going into human services.  I sadly did not get the math/science 
gene some of my relatives have!  I still don't even have a driver's 
licene, I took driver's ed but did not do to well.  Not having a 
license has made my life in terms of career and romance very 
frustrating.  When I tried to learn the martial arts I frustrated my 
instructors because my sensory-motor memory and processing is so bad! 
 So I can't even learn how to defend myself well.  Generally I am a 
slower then normal learner.  I wound up withdrawing from a college 
math class because I was getting lost.  In a world where the ability 
to learn is of the highest importance I am in a bad position.

<p>
The film "Lawnmower Man" made a huge impression on me.  It is still 
one of my all time favorite movies.  Being that I am seriously 
learning disabled the idea of transcending oneself like that utterly 
grabbed me.  I wanted to jump into the film and take one of the 
treatments myself.

<p>
I suffer from serious clinical depression which runs in my family.  
The depression makes me feel very weighed down' I just don't feel like 
doing anything.  I have tried various antidepressants but not found 
one to stick to yet.  Part of this is my fault because I tend to quit 
them when side effects show up or when I run out of money.  Right now 
I am on Effexor time release and plan to stick it out.  I have read 
the book, "Listening to Prozac" and hope to undergo the same type of 
transformation that his patients did in the book.

<p>
A major difficulty is that I don't have a burning passion.  I do like 
studying history with the hope of becoming a teacher, but I am not on 
fire for it.  I am afraid of committing myself to the wrong career 
path.  But maybe as my depression clears I will find it.

<p>
Though Alaska is great in the summer, the long dark winters really get 
me down.  I think down the road I may move out of state to improve my 
life.  This is a  city where you need a car because of a lousy bus 
system, snowy, icy, cold climate, and how everything is spread out.

<p>
To top things off a.d.d. afflicts me.  It is only really apparent to 
me I think.  I have a hard time focusing, especially in classes with 
long lectures.  But I also have a problem focusing on a task, while 
instead I find myself pacing.  I think that part of my problem is 
self-discipline to do the things I need to, but at the same time my 
other problems make it very hard to make progress.  I asked my doctor 
for ritalin but he balked because of possible negative government 
oversight of such things.  I have limited funds but I think it might 
help me.

<p>
I always sensed that I had problems.  But recently I was tested by a 
neuropsychologist who verified my beliefs completely.  He felt that 
the depression was the worst problem for me.  Despite this 
professional diagnosis I still have friends who don't believe any of 
it.

<p>
These problems were greatly compounded by my father who walked out on 
my family.  While I grew up in a poor home needing him, he worked at a 
job as a resort critic traveling the globe.  For him the major goal in 
life was to have fun and sleep with as many women as he could.  With 
his good looks that I did not inherit he carried out that goal very 
well.  Despite all this I hired a company to track him down for me.  
To my surprise they found him so I made contact.  Cheap, powerful 
computing made it possible for me to inexpensively find him.  he was 
thrilled to hear from me; old age and retirement had humbled him 
somewhat.  We are friends now, with him in the big apple and me in 
Anchorage.  He never apologized, but where would he start?

<p>
I have learned painfully about rejection from women who would date me, 
but not take me seriously because of my lack of worldly success.  This 
has caused me some of the greatest emotional pain of my life.  But 
then I have read books on sociobiology in regards to human behavior.  
The human courtship ritual with its social currencies in the balance 
can be cruel.  I just don't have enough social currency dollars to 
make a purchase.  So many times I have felt so enraged and frustrated 
over my genetic failings.  To think I have relatives who are 
engineers.  

<p>
I feel that with my thorns in the flesh I have been cheated out of the 
potential I should have had.  I have a great deal of frustration over 
all my wasted years.  Most men my age have a degree, good job, and car 
at this point in their life with which to enjoy life, and attract a 
mate.

<p>
To me cryonics offers a chance to experience life like I should have 
in the first place.  I wish for the doctors of the future to wipe away 
my genetic imperfections.  I feel anger and God and life for being 
like this, though I experience guilt over that sometimes.  I am told 
that in the  everything will be remedied, which I believe, but I want 
my chance in this world.   Most of the very people who tell me things 
will work out are ones who have no l.d., a.d.d., and depression to 
hold them back from their goals.  They drive, have degrees and good 
jobs, make love, and have general satisfaction in their lives.

<p>
I believe in God but I feel like I have a lack of faith to want to be 
suspended.  If the fundamentalist view of  prophecy is true then my 
frozen body may will be destroyed in the geological and social turmoil 
of the last days before the second coming of Christ.  Then I will wind 
up facing God in judgement having cowardly tried to avoid him by 
suspended.  The test of my faith for him would be to let nature take 
it's course and cause me to die naturally.  When I read about the life 
and example of Jesus I feel touched and believe that there must be a 
literal truth to it.  I feel that either dismiss your beliefs or my 
own would be a mistake.

<p>
I find comfort in the belief of a loving God who has this life as sort 
of a "boot camp" experience for us to be prepared for the next.  
Though not always pleasant, we are here to learn and grow.  Part of 
the trial of life is that things at least right now are so unfair.  
But I believe that for those who try to live God's way his spirit will 
be given to them to comfort and strengthen them.

<p>
I am not evangelical but mormon.  Our belief that men and women in the 
next life become gods borders on the extropian.  For this belief we 
have been vilified by some evangelicals.  We also believe that men and 
women are the literal children of God, and that in a "premortal life" 
we lived with him and learned and grew there.  We believe that the 
talents that people sometimes just naturally seem to have were first 
developed there and so in this life to a certain extent we are 
rediscovering them.   And we have the belief in 
marriage having the chance to last for all time and eternity when the 
bond is sealed in one of our temples and the couple live God's way.  
To me this is a very powerful and romantic notion.

<p>
I almost look at cryonic suspension like I do the exhortation of my 
church leaders to have a two years supply of food and supplies for 
times of emergency.  I just have a hard time imagining how I would 
explain to a future wife why a cryonics firm and not she and the kids 
are the beneficiary of my life insurance policy.

<p>
The human lifespan is just too short!!  I want to be able to "look 
over the horizon" in the coming century.  Even if I lived to be ninety 
that would not be long enough to have a solid feel for who really had 
<pre>
the truth, and where the world was headed.  This world is so unfair in 
parcelling out beauty, wealth, and talent.  I want to live in an age 
where the playing field is much more  out.

</pre>
<p>
I am thinking seriously of transferring to a mormon college, Brigham  
Young-Hawaii campus.  Maybe I will find a woman there who will take a 
chance on me.  But before I do that I need to get my grades up and 
finances in order.  

<p>
Due to an F grade and two incompletes over two semesters it looks 
like I may lose 
<br>
my student loans, and so no more school.  I have really shot myself in 
the foot.  My whole  is only about 2.3 right now.  I know I should 
have done much better.  Part of the problem is my disorganization, 
l.d., a.d.d., and depression.  I must force myself to put forth much 
more self-discipline, and manage my time and resources well.

<p>
<a name="0354qlink1">Originally I wanted to wanted to start college by taking an intensive 
remedial program to bone up on the academic basics.  But I tested high 
so they strongly recommended that I go into deeper waters.</a>  I think 
back on it and think I would have had a smoother ride if I had 
insisted to stay in the program.

<p>
I remember being a young man reading a children's Bible.  I read the 
passage about how before the flood humans lived for many centuries!  I 
brought it up to my mother's attention that I wished people still did, 
and she agreed with me.  That moment planted a seed somehow.

<p>
I am very impressed with Cryocare and Biopreservation.  The efforts 
and results of Mike Darwin and his colleagues to improve suspension 
techniques are of the highest caliber.  I was taken by how in his 
writings he is open about the damage that happens to the brain by 
conventional suspension methods.  I would not want to be one of those 
people already suspended.  Fortunately I have hopefully three or four 
more decades ahead of me for the technology to mature.  By the time 
I'm ready, the technology should be ready.  The research being done by 
21st Century Medicine will revolutionize how suspensions are done!

<p>
Cryocare people claim Alcor is not the equal of Biopreservation  in 
suspension technology.  I just hope Alcor and the other groups adopt 
all the new methods for suspension used by Biopreservation.  The 
decentralized structure of Cryocare should make it less vulnerable to 
institutional entropy.  At least though Alcor and CI is outside of 
California, so when and if the big one hits you will not be a cryonic 
casualty.  I would like Cryocare to manage me, Biopreservation to 
suspend, and Alcor or CI to store.  I plan to ask for 
neuropreservation if it is true that to optimize brain suspension you 
should remove the head from the body.  Though if inflation totally 
devalues my indexed life insurance policy over time I may wind up 
having to go with CI!

<p>
It does bother me how relatively few people are signed up.  But in 
time I think there will be a major change there.  To promote cryonics 
and  has any of the leadership gone on the Art Bell radio show?  I 
would assume by now it has been done, but if not it would be a great 
way to reach millions.  The man's ability to sway the public is 
powerful.

<p>
I can't wait till the Hallmark made for t.v. movie version of "The 
First Immortal" comes out!  Considering the quality of Hallmark 
productions, and the fact that the director of "Lonesome Dove" is 
doing the movie it should be fantastic.  I think the release of this 
will be the huge turning point in public opinion that you are looking 
for.  Be ready to be swamped afterwards with public interest.

<p>
Personally I wish that having lived my life and being in my early 
seventies I could go to my suspension provider and with the right 
legal documents ask them to induce clinical death so they could on the 
spot suspend me!  I don't like the idea of waiting around to die and 
then finally passing away unexpectedly only to have my brain decay for 
several hours or even days.  Mike Darwin's research made this point 
crystal clear.  I think that I should have the right to do this, since 
it is not by my definition suicide, but instead a calculated risk.  I 
realize that some disability rights organizations are militantly 
against right to die because they feel that down the road they may be 
targeted by society as the unfit that should be coerced to their 
deaths.  But I honestly don't see this happening.

<p>
I am concerned that while the doctors of the future will reanimate us 
in perfected versions of our selves, that they may not to upgrade us 
to their level of intellect and functioning.  This may be because they 
can't, (to be more like them may take modification at the early stage 
of being a zygote) or because they feel that it would be more 
interesting to see us try to survive in their society as limited 
beings for the sake of sociological study.  Our hope would would have 
to be that in time things would 
<br>
change technologically and socially.  At least the reanimated would 
have each other for company.  If suspension were available for me 
alone I would reject it.  I want others from my time to associate 
with.

<p>
The Prometheus Project has really got my interest.  It bothers me that 
they are underfunded at this point.  I wonder though if they could 
really pull off their objective even with twenty million raised over a 
number of years.  With all the billions wasted by governments 
worldwide it bothers me that the project leaders must almost go 
begging for such important work.  

<p>
I read an interview with the 
<br>
president and owner of Oracle computing, who is worth over six 
billion.  I don't recall his name, but in the article he seemed to 
have the type of personality that might be intrigued by the project.  
But of course even getting near the man to submit a proposal would be 
another story.  I can see why Eleizer would want to start a digest to 
attract the wealthy.  I admit I would love to subscribe to it just to 
see how things progress.  Unless I really felt I had something to add 
I would be silent.  In fact you could have two levels of subscribers, 
those who can input, and those who can't.  I would be content to be 
the latter.  

<p>
What we should really do is have one of us meet that brilliant young 
boy that Bill Gates took under his wing to educate and mold.  If a 
reporter could get to him while the bodyguard was in the bathroom 
maybe one of us could do the same.  In a few minutes of conversation 
and some pamphlets with basic info and website addresses we could 
implant in the mind of this possible future multimillionaire the memes 
that could change his own future for good and our own.  Think if Bill 
Gates had been reached as a young man by an early follower of 
Ettinger!  Gates probably at this point is close minded about us and 
the possiblity of donations, but there is hope with his possible 
protege.  Ten or fifteen years from now the reaching out of one of us 
to him could pay enormous dividends to a group like The Prometheus 
Project.  I implore Max More and Natasha, along with everyone else to 
consider this.  It is time to hatch a plan!  

<p>
I especially like the Prometheus Project because I have some nagging 
doubts about nanotech.  This began to develop after reading an article 
by an actual researcher in the field who wrote an article in "The 
Scientific American".  He said the reality of the situation is that 
there are huge obstacles to Drexler's ideas. Making mechanisms work 
like we want them
<br>
to do at such small dimensions is extremely frustrating he claimed.  
He even called those who thought  would in time transform the world 
believers in "cargo cult" misguided thinking.  But perhaps over time 
and with the present impressive funding levels for research the 
barriers can be overcome.  Isn't corporate and national rivalry just 
great sometimes?  Can't let that untrustworthy rival get the upper 
hand!  Now if only cryonics and longevity research could get such 
reactions.

<p>
I am very impressed by the three prominent women of extropianism, 
Natasha-Vita More(aestheticgirl!), Gina Miller(nanogirl!), and Romana 
Machado(leathergirl!).  Even though certainly they are no longer girls 
but mature, and very gifted and intelligent women.  I am going to have 
to really improve myself to be worthy of the women of the future if 
they resemble these ladies!      

<p>
Well everyone, I just want to thank you for listening to all my 
ramblings.  It felt good to get it all out.  I hope things are going 
great for you all!  I look forward to your replies and wish you all 
the best.
  
<p>
Maybe one day we will all get to attend that party at the edge of the 
galaxy they talk about or another party sometime sooner.  I am really 
going to try to attend Extro 4 if I can manage.  I realize that I am 
in the presence of intellects far greater then my own on the digest 
and I am somewhat intimidated at times, but at least I am learning and 
enjoying myself.  

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
