Joe thanks for sharing my sense of humor on a serious subject.  {8^D

Sorry to hear of your parents having such problems.  {8-(
Emphysema is a special case I have always wondered about.  Looks
to me like if left to run its course, the contents of one's brain is
erased in the last weeks of so-called life by lack of oxygen.  A cryonicist
would seek what may be defined as assisted suicide by the state
(cryonic suspension) before one suffered a total cranial degaussing.

<p>
<a name="0228qlink1">Now, perhaps some cryonicist can help me out on a topic that
has come up before on this list, but I feel I can now add a new
twist.  Suppose I go in for cryonics, and 100 yrs goes by.  Now
my living descendants are actually demotivated to reanimate me.
They have no emotional connection, they never knew me.  I must
figure out some way to make it profitable for those who would
be burdened with my care, should I be reanimated without the
essential job skills of the mid 22nd century.  I still have not figured
out how to squirrel away wealth in some fashion that my descendants
(should I ever have any) would not rather try to inherit, after
causing my accidental unsuccessful thawing.  Ideas?  spike
