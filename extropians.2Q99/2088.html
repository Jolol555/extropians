As you can see from my new .signature, I have now installed BeOS on my
machine.  I am also typing this message on a Dvorak keyboard.  In the
last election, I voted Libertarian where possible.  I'm a
Singularitarian, and thus by extension a transhumanist, a
science-fiction fan, and a novelty-seeker.  Coincidence?  I think not. 
For some people, There Is A Better Way.

<p>
Let us consider:  Is someone running MacOS or Linux or BeOS, even though
95% of the planet uses Windows, more likely to use the Dvorak keyboard,
even though 95% of the planet uses QWERTY?  Is someone who votes
Libertarian more likely to be a transhumanist?  I have no hard
statistics on the subject, but I suspect that there is considerable
overlap between the groups.

<p>
I'd like to list the following items for a Better Way Award.  The Better
Way Awards are given to Ways (1) that inspire fanatic devotion in their
users and (2) that only a minority use - and, of course, are vastly
Better than the alternatives.
