<a name="3968qlink1">Rather than complain about the quality of the list (which certainly varies
over time, whatever your standards or interests), why not offer
constructive suggestions?</a>

<p>
<a name="4534qlink1">We are currently considering the workability and details of having a
moderated list.</a> NOW--*before* we implement this--is the time to suggest
creative possibilities for improving the quality. The NodeNet idea was one
attempt to deal with it, but so far has not worked out.

<p>
Let's hear some creative intelligence at work. How can we have high
<a name="3959qlink1">quality, informative communications while maintaining a community? I have
already suggested a group of bulletin boards lists, which would be more
focused and where off-topic posts would be excluded (but would find a home
on a cousin list). I still think this could work if we had the resources to
commit (my model is the Motley Fool's message Boards, including their "My
Fool" feature that allows customization). I would be delighted to see
someone take on the research into this--what software is available for a
simple system, how much admin it requires, cost, etc.</a>

<p>
Moderation is an obvious possibility, but requires work on the part of one
or more people.

<p>
More strict enforcement of more defined list rules is another possibility.

<p>
Simply breaking the list up into special purpose lists is another, perhaps
with an "Extropians-Chat" or "Extropians-Social" list for general community
discussions unrelated to particular topics.

<p>
Certainly the list as it currenty functions is not something I particularly
want to show off to intelligent, mature, potential extropians. There is
some excellent content here, but it's buried under piles of low value
verbiage.

<p>
<a name="3968qlink2">So, again, let's hear some creative suggestions, taking into account ExI's
limited resources. Comments on the above possibilities or entirely
different ideas welcomed!</a>

<p>
Onward!
