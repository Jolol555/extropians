I should expand: I am in favor of those who pass a licensing test, and meet
the other criteria of gun ownership, to carry UNCONCEALED weapons, just as
police officers do. Along with this would be a quasi-deputy-cop position,
similar to the volunteer fireman we have in many areas. These people would
have all the responsibilities of the police as to when and if they shoot.
Unconcealed carry is legal in some areas already - Arizona comes to mind -
and I don't recall many problems being related to it getting into the
national news.

<p>
Concealed weapons obviously do not become a factor in any encounter</a> until
they are drawn, or at least made visible. My fuddled brain at work there..

<p>
Hence my suggestion. Any police officer or citizen could request the gun
carrier's credentials, and could report any who appeared to be carrying
without proper license.
