In this regard, the classic story "Black Like Me" offers some great insight 
into the complexities of race perception and the issues raised generally by 
"us" and "them" tribal thinking.  This book might well be a good nominee for 
a place on a transhumanist reading list, given its fundamental premise of 
self-changing through technology and its theme of challenging shallow 
assumptions about racial identity.  (Also, don't miss the little-known film 
version of this story, if you get the chance: Spencer Tracy in the 
under-appreciated leading role!)

<p>
More generally, I think Anders has done us all a great favor by raising the 
issue of current and historical racism in the context of transhumanism.  What 
an irony that it may well be members of the most privileged racial and 
socio-economic groups that could, by their first experiments in transhumanist 
augmentation, trigger a wholly new type of racism!
