Abstract
<br>
  Among many pharmaceuticals that have been tested for their effects on
  longevities of different animal rodents, deprenyl is unique
  in that its effects on longevity has been tested in at least four different
  animal species by independent research groups and that the effect has been
  postulated to be due to its effect of raising such antioxidant enzyme
  activities as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in selective
  brain regions. Thus far, in all four species of animals examined (rats, mice,
  hamsters, and dogs), a positive effect was demonstrated, although the extent
  of its effect is quite variable. Our group has examined the effect on
  longevities in rats and mice and on antioxidant enzymes in rats, mice, and
  dogs. Although in rats of both sexes, we have obtained positive effects on
  longevity, two studies with different doses in mice did not reveal a
  significantly positive effect. We have observed, however, significantly
  positive effects on SOD (in Cu, Zn-, and Mn-) as well as CAT (but not
  glutathione peroxidase) activities in the brain dopaminergic system such as
  in the S. nigra and striatum (but not in hippocampus) in all rats, mice, and
  dogs, although the effects were quite variable, depending on the doses used.
  In mice, however, a long-term administration (3x/w, 3 months) caused a
  remarkable decrease in the magnitude of activity as well as a narrowing of
  the effective dose range, which may explain a relatively weak effect of the
  drug on mouse longevity. Further, a recent study on aging beagle dogs by
  Ruehl et al. showed a remarkable effect on longevity, which agrees with our
  SOD study in dogs. Although deprenyl has been claimed to
  have several other effects, such as a radical scavenging effect and a
  neuroprotective effect, past reports on its effects on longevities and
  antioxidant defenses are compatible with the notion that the drug prolongs
  the life span of animals by reducing the oxidative damage to the brain
  dopaminergic system during aging. Further, our studies on F-344 rats as well
  as a dog study by Ruehl et al. suggest that the drug may at least partially
  prolong the life span of animals by enhancing immune system function and
  preventing tumor development in animals. [References: 36]
