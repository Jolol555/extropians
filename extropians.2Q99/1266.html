<a name="1267qlink1">I would recommend learning Java *first*.  Java is probably the
best-designed language around right now, and the one that will start out
by teaching you the right programming ideas.  Reading a Perl book, and
paying particular attention to all the arcane features, is an excellent
introduction to Old High Hackerdom, meaning Unix and whatnot; also, Perl
is the present language of the Web - although Java servlets are coming
up fast.  If you want to write actual GUI applications, or anything fast
and smooth, there's basically no choice but to use C++.</a>

<p>
I would also recommend looking at at least one LISP dialect - Scheme is
the most beautiful, although Common Lisp is what gets used for actually
programming things.  Other programming languages that are interesting
include Haskell, BETA, APL, MOO, and Eiffel; but, like Scheme, they're
languages you learn for the concepts and not because you can actually do
anything with them.

<p>
I strongly advise not learning how to program in plain C at all - like
COBOL, BASIC, and Pascal, the language teaches bad habits.  If you can,
start out with a GUI compiler - a command-line system may be slightly
more powerful but it's a bloody pain in the neck.  Like assembly
language, command-line systems are a dark, high power from the dawn of
computing, which only the pure of heart may touch without harm.

<p>
BTW, you do have a choice of operating system, whether you know it or
not.  If you want to develop GUI apps with C++, and you don't care about
the size of the market, develop for BeOS.  If you have a non-G3
Macintosh or Wintel system, you can almost certainly install the BeOS
operating system in a separate hard-drive partition.  BeOS only costs
$69.95, includes a complete GUI compiler (most places you can't even buy
a GUI compiler for less than $300), and is by far the easiest and best
operating system to program for.

<a name="1273qlink1">Ah, to be 13 again, and have a chance to study all the things I missed
with a working brain!  Don't forget to study cognitive science, too. 
Above all else, get some exposure to evolutionary psychology.  Not full
time, *yet* - if you want to learn the mental disciplines of
rationality, the best time is 15-17, but it's a good idea to get used to
playing with your mind before then.  At 19, I know the next step to
take, but I haven't been able to do it - if I were 16, it would have
taken me a month tops.  Over the hill.  Sigh.</a>
