Read the list?  You mean the WHOLE list?  Ouch!  My hat is off to you, sir.
 You have done your homework.  Such a one is a man to be reckoned with.

one hereabouts has heard anything about any extreme claims.  Perhaps you
have the wrong office.  Try down the hall.  Third door on the right.  You

Good luck.  Nice tie.
