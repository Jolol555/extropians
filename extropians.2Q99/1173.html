<a name="1182qlink1">I can knock out my own argument I proposed last week: that there
was probably no technology in the great library that we have not
greatly exceeded.  I thought of an honest to Greek gods *technology*
that they had, that we do not have now: how to make stone arches.</a>

<p>
Today stone arches are approximated.  Usually they are fake: the
arch is made of cement with fake lines drawn in the wet facade.

<p>
Consider this, those of you who are mechanically inclined.  Draw an
arch.  Put in lines perpendicular to the arch that describe a number
of wedge shaped stones.  Challenge: draw the lines in such a way
that each stone is in pure compression (no part of the stone may
be in bending moment) and there is no shear force at the interfaces
between the stones.

<p>
Another way to state the problem is this: shape your stones</a> such
that the force vectors from the adjacent stones exactly equals the
gravitation
<br>
vector.  Obviously, the included angle in the top stone would be larger
than the stone that whose centerline is 30 degrees from horizontal.
In fact, the included angle of each stone is different from all the rest.

<p>
<a name="1182qlink2">Can you calculate all the included angles without your computer?
Can you calculate them *with* your computer?
Evidently the Greeks knew how to do these stone arches.</a>
