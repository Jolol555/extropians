<p>
Well, I guess I just like surprises...

<p>
At this point, after decades of learning about how spooky, mysterious,
non-local and non-causal quantum mechanics is, finding an interpretation
which is more in keeping with our prosaic instincts is the more
interesting result.<a name="3361qlink1">  Maybe it will turn out that we have had, under our
noses, a much more understandable quantum mechanics, but we have been
overlooking it.  This would be quite amazing and instructive.</a>

<p>
Also, a way of looking at QM which is more in keeping with our instinctive
understanding of Nature may end up increasing progress in the long run,
not just because a more truthful picture is more useful, but because
we can do a better job if we can trust our instincts.  Many people have
been confused by QM, as seen for example in the suggestions to use quanum
teleportation for remote sensing applications.  A more understandable
picture will automatically improve our understanding.
