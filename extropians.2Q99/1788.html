<a href="1785.html#1788qlink1">&gt; separation of hard and soft sciences is another</a><br>

<p>
To true.

<p>
It is not the sciences that are soft, it is the people in them.

<p>
Psychology is a science, period. But most people in psychology departments
see science as an intrinsically misogynistic arm of capitalism which must
constantly be guarded against lest it get "out of control" - imagine - too
much science: how terrible.

<p>
Hence student essays which begin "x (intelligence, personality ... ) cannot
be universally defined, ever."  And conclude that the writer is therefore
going to continue believing whatever he/she likes in this area: be it Freud
or EMDR.

<p>
Of course physics and biology are every bit as "soft". Just see how soft
people make it when it gets in the way of their religion (hubble and the big
bang theories), mystical persuasion (quantum mechanics), or political
beliefs (nuclear power, green house gases).

<p>
best,
