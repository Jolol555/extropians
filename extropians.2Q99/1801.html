<i>&gt;perfectly safe? </i><br>
I program medical and avionic systems, and the general criteria are
pretty straight-forward.
<br>
You test the thing for designed behavior, and then you test it for
environmental
<br>
benignity (e.g. operating-room equipment has saline solution pured on it,
and
<br>
stell rods poked into open orfices, and various shorts on teh pweor plug)</a>

<i>&gt;before an AI program was allowed to completely run a nuclear power</i><br>
<i>&gt;plant?</i><br>
Well, speaking as a professional safety engineer, I think this would be
an easy
<br>
argument.  Just test the program with the same simulation used to train
the
<br>
human operator.  If it does ok, then it's ok.

<p>
However, most regulatory environments require that no single fault should
be able to induce a harmful failure (this is simple common sense,
really).
<br>
Therefore, one might have a much easier time with certification
 if there was a second AI, with a different design, to second-guess or
cooperate with the first.  This makes the system far less prone to fail
the first time an AI makes
<br>
a mistake,  And, it _will_, right?</a>
