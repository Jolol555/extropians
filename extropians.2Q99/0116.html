<p>
Eliezer has posed some fascinating puzzles, and I hope that people will
take the time to read them and try to give answers.

<p>
<a href="0103.html#0116qlink1">&gt; Let's suppose that we record the tape, states, position, and actions</a><br>
<i>&gt; of a conscious Turing machine, and play it back.  Is the playback</i><br>
<i>&gt; conscious?  Probably not, because there's no causality, right?  And if</i><br>
<i>&gt; the playback was generated by quantum randomness, at some extreme level</i><br>
<i>&gt; of improbability, then the conscious being "recorded" doesn't exist</i><br>
<i>&gt; yet, right?</i><br>

<p>
One aspect of most of these puzzles is that they focus on the issue
of playback.  I've seen several other paradoxes which also are based on
this idea.

<p>
<a name="0179qlink1">Are playbacks of conscious calculations themselves conscious?</a>

<p>
My approach to this problem is to look at it from the point of view of
the (simulated?) consciousness itself.  Suppose, right now, I am aware
that I am running in a computer of some sort, and that the computer's
state information will be recorded and then played back using the various
scenarios that Eliezer suggests.

<p>
To ask whether the playback is conscious is to ask, from my perspective,
might I be experiencing a playback right now?  Is this "instance" of my
consciousness the result of a dynamic, causally-determined calculation,
or the result of a passive playback?

<p>
<a name="0131qlink1">The problem is, I can't give a meaningful answer to the question.
Any answer I could give about what larger external environment I might
be a part of cannot be correct in most cases.  Even if my consciousness
only exists during a causally based run of a computer, it could still be
run multiple times.  Each time, I will behave in exactly the same way.
(I am assuming that there are not uncomputable elements necessary
for consciousness.)  Each time, I will think exactly the same thing.
If I think to myself, "*this* instance of my consciousness is happening
on the third run of the experiment", I will think that every time.
It has to be wrong most of the time.</a>

<p>
What, then, can I reasonably believe about the circumstances which
surround this instantiation of myself?  As I see it, I can't conclude
anything specific about them.  I might be run one time, I might be
run 1000 times, and it will feel exactly the same.  My "inner" time and
sense of conciousness has no relation whatsoever to outer time and place.
I might be run one million times slower than real time, or one million
times faster.  My brain could be simulated by a galaxy-wide computer with
one processing element per star system, with each thought taking eons.
None of this will be perceptible to me.

<p>
<i>&gt;From my own perceptions and senses, I can't conclude anything about the</i><br>
external world.  I can't tell how many times I am instantiated; I can't
tell which particular systems instantiate me.

<p>
In particular, I can't tell whether a replay is conscious.  It might be,
or it might not be.  It would make no perceptible difference to me.

<p>
If even I, the inner conscious entity, can't tell whether a replay is
conscious, is it really a meaningful question?

<p>
Throughout the philosophy of consciousness, we continually face a
dichotomy between the objective and the subjective.  We try to link
them; computationalism and, more generlly, materialism, try to say
that there are objective facts corresponding to the subjective facts
of consciousness.

<p>
But in this case, there is no subjective fact to begin with.  There is
no subjective meaning to the question of whether a replay is conscious.
Therefore, I'd suggest, we can say that there is no objective meaning
to the matter, either.

<p>
<a name="0126qlink1">Simply put, it is meaningless to ask whether a replay is conscious; it
is meaningless even to ask whether a second run of a conscious program
further instantiates the consciousness.  There is no subjective fact of
the matter to resolve, and so there is no objective problem which can
be solved, either.
