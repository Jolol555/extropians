<a name="0765qlink1">      I find myself unable to agree with these comments. Maybe sexual 
pleasure and neural science will "combine" as opposed to delete one 
sex out all together.</a>
<p>
<a name="0765qlink2">      This is some of what I was saying previously though, about 
individual choice. You could choose sex as nill, non-void in your 
life, you could focus on whatever you wish. And so could others, 
different as they may</a> be. 
<p>
<a name="0765qlink3">     Did you really say "sex is not productive in our current 
society" I don't know about your angle on this, but sex is a sure 
fire benefit to me!</a>
<p>
<a name="0765qlink4">     Also I'd have to say that drug addicts still feel and enjoy sex. 
I'm not one, but I am not oblivious. I don't know anyone who doesn't 
like sex, excluding the obvious celebits, monks, and nuns and I'm 
sure a few others.</a> 
<p>
<a name="0765qlink5">     And as far as the vampire gig, you could include this in the 
layering of engineering the usual unsexual sensation's along</a> with the 
typical.

<a href="0757.html#0758qlink1">&gt;It seems to me that after a certain amount of time, sexual pleasure </a><br>
will be
<br>
<a href="0757.html#0758qlink2">&gt;obsolete, due to greater advances in neural science. Not only is it </a><br>
not productive ( wow... what an incredible unintentional pun) in our 
current society, it can and will be superceded by greater methods of 
pleasure. Even today, for a lot of heroin users sex pales in 
comparison to the purely
<br>
<a href="0757.html#0758qlink3">&gt;chemical high. Who knows what's coming next?</a><br>
<i>&gt;I'm reminded of the role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade (I </i><br>
noticed some roll-playing buffs on this list) where the immortal (see 
a parallel, anyone?) vampires have replaced the lust for sex with the 
far more powerful lust for human blood, which is the sustenance of 
the species.
<br>
<a href="0757.html#0758qlink4">&gt;Might we be doing ourselves a favor to somehow link physical </a><br>
pleasure with
<br>
<a href="0757.html#0758qlink5">&gt;that by which will sustain ourselves in the future?</a><br>
