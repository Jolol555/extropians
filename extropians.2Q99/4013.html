Nicotine is highly soluable in water, and therefore water pipes are rather
useless to the habitual tobacco smoker. In cultures where such pipes are
commonly used for tobacco consumption, the liquid is usually wine, or a
mixture of wine and a little water.</a>

<p>
<a name="4086qlink3">On the other hand, the cannabinoids (of which cannibinol is but a single
example, btw) are not water soluable to any extent, and therefore water
pipes can be of great benefit to the smoker of cannabis (aka marijuana), as
much of the tar and other undesirable elements will be removed from the
smoke during its passage through the pipe, while the vast majority of the
psychoactive components will be unimpeded. [Actually, passage through the
water can cool them in their vapour phase and some will condence out as
oily droplets, either stucjk to the inside surface of the pipe, or
suspended in the water - immiscible but nonetheless trapped. This small
fraction of oil can be recovered by the clever (or desperate ;P ), but is
typically discarded].</a>

<p>
For those interested in more studies/articles about this or other
psychotropically oriented questions, might I suggest the site for the
Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (<a href="http://www.maps.org">http://www.maps.org</a>)
and the Vaults of Erowid (<a href="http://www.erowid.org">http://www.erowid.org</a>).
