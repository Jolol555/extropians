<a href="4270.html#4414qlink1">&gt; When I was in high school, there was a guy who was expounding on</a><br>
<i>&gt; male/female</i><br>
<i>&gt; differences.  I piped up and said well what about me?  And without</i><br>
<a name="4437qlink1"><i>&gt; hesitation he</i><br>
<i>&gt; told me that "You don't count".  It was an enlightening experience, and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am afraid</i><br>
<i>&gt; that most people don't consider me to be a 'real' woman.</i><br>

<a name="4445qlink1"><a name="4426qlink1">Don't take it as an insult. Men in general will not admit it in public,
<a name="4437qlink2">especially, I predict, American men, but women are on the whole perceived as
annoyingly superficial with a one-track "social probe" masquerading as a
</a>mind.<a name="4437qlink3"> The guy that said "you don't count" was probably referring to the fact
that you seem more intelligent and insightful than women usually</a> are.
