  Radioprotective effects of antioxidative plant flavonoids in mice.

Abstract
<br>
  Radioprotective effects of tea infusions and plant flavonoids were
  investigated by using the micronucleus test for anticlastogenic activity and
  the thiobarbituric acid assay for antioxidative activity. A single gastric
  intubation of rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis) infusion at
  1 ml per mouse 2 h prior to gama-ray irradiation (1.5 Gy) reduced the
  frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (MNRETs). After the fractionation
  of rooibos tea infusion, the flavonoid fraction was found to
  be most anticlastogenic and antioxidative. From this fraction, luteolin was
  isolated as an effective component. Then, anticlastogenic effects of 12
  flavonoids containing luteolin and their antioxidative activities against
  lipid peroxidation by Fenton's reagent were examined. A good correlation
  (r=0.717) was observed between both activities. Luteolin showed the most
  effective potency. A gastric intubation of luteolin (10 micromoles/kg) 2 h
  prior to gamma-ray irradiation (6 Gy) suppressed lipid peroxidation in mouse
  bone marrow and spleen and a trend of protective effect of luteolin against
  the decrease of endogenous ascorbic acid in mouse bone marrow after gamma-ray
  irradiation (3 Gy) was observed. These results suggest that plant flavonoids,
  which show antioxidative potency in vitro, work as antioxidants in vivo and
  their radioprotective effects may be attributed to their scavenging potency
  towards free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals. Therefore, the flavonoids
  contained in tea, vegetables and fruits seem to be important as antioxidants
  in the human diet.

  The suppression of age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in rat brain
  by administration of Rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis).

Abstract
<br>
  The protective effects of Rooibos tea (RT), Aspalathus
  linearis, against damage to the central nervous system (CNS) accompanying
  aging were examined by both the thiobarbituric acid reaction (TBA) and
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods in brains of chronically RT-treated
  rats. Ad libitum administration of RT was begun with 3-month-old Wistar
  female rats and continued for 21 months. The contents of TBA reactive
  substances (TBARS) in the frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus and
  cerebellum in 24-month-old rats after administration with water were
  significantly higher than those in young rats (5 weeks old). However, no
  significant increase of TBARS was observed in RT-administered aged rats. When
  MR images of the brains of 24-month-old rats with and without RT as well as
  5-week-old rats were taken, a decrease of the signal intensity was observed
  in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum in MR images of aged rats
  without RT, whereas little change of the signal intensity was observed in MR
  images of the same regions of 24-month-old rats treated with RT, whose images
  were similar to those of young rats. These observations suggested that (1)
  the age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in the brain was closely
  related to the morphological changes observed by MRI, and (2) chronic
  RT-administration prevented age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in
  several regions of rat brain.

Abstract
<br>
  The suppressing effects of crude extracts of three kinds of tea-green tea
  (GT) from Japan, Po-lei tea (PT) from China, and Rooibos tea
  (RT) from South Africa-on the induction of chromosome aberrations in cultured
  CHO cells and mice were studied. When CHO cells were exposed to each tea
  extract in the presence of rat liver microsomal enzymes (S9 mix) together
  with benzo[a]pyrene (B(a)P) or mitomycin C (MMC), a decrease in the frequency
  of chromosome aberrations was observed. PT and RT, but not GT, also
  suppressed the induction of chromosome aberrations by MMC in the absence of
  S9 mix. When cells were treated with tea extract after B(a)P or MMC
  treatment, RT suppressed the induction of chromosome aberrations in the
  presence and absence of S9 mix whereas GT and PT showed suppressing effects
  only in the presence of S9 mix. These data suggest that catechines,
  well-known antimutagens in tea samples, might account for the inhibitory
  effect in the case of GT and PT. Since RT contains few catechines, several
  unknown antimutagenic components could be responsible for its effect. The
  antimutagenic effects of tea extracts at concentration levels consumed by
  humans were examined in mice using micronucleus induction with B(a)P or MMC.
  When mice received oral gavage of 0.2% GT, 0.1% PT, and 0.1% RT at 1.0
  ml/mouse 6 h before intraperitoneal injection of MMC, a decrease in the
  frequency of micronuclei was observed. The induction of micronuclei by B(a)P
  was suppressed by oral dosage of GT, PT and RT at 1.0 ml/mouse/day for 28
  days. This was not due to a delay in the maturation of micronucleated
  reticulocytes. In conclusion, intake of tea might suppress the mutagenic
  activity of certain potent mutagens in human beings.

  [The effect of rooibos tea on iron absorption]. [Afrikaans]
Source
<br>
  South African Medical Journal.  55(16):631-2, 1979 Apr 14.
Abstract
<br>
  A study was carried out to determine if rooibos tea
  (Aspalathus linearis) has a deleterious effect on iron absorption similar to
  that of ordinary tea (Camellia sinensis). Three groups of volunteers, each
  consisting of 10 healthy young men comparable with regard to iron status and
  body dimensions, were studied. After ingestion of 1 muCi 59Fe and 16 mg of
  elemental iron, group A drank rooibos tea, group B ordinary
  tea and group C boiled water. Iron absorption was measured 14 days later with
  a whole body counter. Mean iron absorption after ingestion of
  rooibos tea, ordinary tea, and water was 7,25%, 1,70% and
  9,34% respectively. In contrast to ordinary tea (P less than 0,0001),
  rooibos tea did not affect iron absorption significantly.
  The ascorbic acid content of rooibos tea varies between
  121,8 and 154,9 mumol/l, depending on the method of preparation.
  Rooibos tea contains small amounts of iron, magnesium,
  phosphorus, sodium, chloride and potassium. These findings have practical
  nutritional and therapeutic implications.
