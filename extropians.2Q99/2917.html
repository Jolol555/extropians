While I don't drive much any more, I frequently drive a sporty two-door
vehicle when I need to run an errand around town.  I have to admit that
sports cars are a lot more fun to drive in general.  The vehicle-to-human
interface in modern, high-performance sports cars is very well done.
Nonetheless, for my frequent long-range road trips to the uninhabited parts
of North America, I take my Bronco every time.

I partially disagree here.  Many of the SUVs popular in the suburbs *are*
lightweight, modern vehicles.  Most of these popular vehicles (particularly
the imports) are essentially minivans with a new body design.  Most SUVs
popular today look more rugged than they actually are; they are primarily
being designed as commuter vehicles.  I think part of the popularity of
SUVs, as they have currently been reinvented, are that minivans are
definitely not "cool".  SUVs retain the aura of coolness while keeping the
usefulness of a minivan.  A telling point is that many Japanese import SUVs
are All Wheel Drive (AWD) vehicles, which is markedly inferior to true 4WD
for rugged environments but fine if you never leave the highway.  Most
current SUVs are modern road vehicles in every sense of the word, nearly as
much so as modern sports cars.

<p>
I still own my Bronco (a *real* SUV), but not because SUVs are currently
popular; after all, the Bronco is not a "cool" SUV in the California sense.
 I own hundreds and hundreds of acres of remote property in the Nevada
mountains (for camping, shooting, hunting, or whatever) that is only
accessible with a vehicle like my Bronco.  To reinforce a point, most
popular (imported) SUVs fair poorly in these mountains without a lot of
aftermarket reinforcement, whereas many American SUVs do fine in factory
configuration with good tires.  Most American SUVs (which were invented a
long time ago because they have a real reason to exist in some parts of
North America) are still built for rugged use, although this is also
changing somewhat as they become popular suburban vehicles.
