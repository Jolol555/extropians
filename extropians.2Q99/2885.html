John, Im not sure Donna would be thrilled with your recording
this information in a format that will be around long after you and I
have passed off the scene.  {8-D

Well this blows a theory of mine.  I wondered if email relationships might
be the very most honest and forthright that are possible, since the participants

<p>
would have no motive to deceive.  Guess not.

<p>
My notion was that all people start all relationships in a way that
is deceptive.  Hear this out a minute: everything we do and everything
we say, intentionally or otherwise, either fails to tell the whole story
or spins a story.  Im not saying we lie, Im saying we fail to communicate
perfectly, whether we want to or not.

<p>
Example, coworker:  Good morning Spike, how are you?
Me: Fine.

<p>
It might be rain and snow outside, not a good morning at all,
and I have a hangover, but still I say, fine.

<p>
Now, think about this.  Even clothing is a lie, in a sense.  Im not
suggesting we go nude, just stretching a point.

<p>
Email relationships are the only human relationships I know where you
have at least a possibility of total honesty, or at least as close
as we can get to it.  People will say things in email they would
never utter to even their best friend.  So.  Dont ever blow it.
This is our chance...
