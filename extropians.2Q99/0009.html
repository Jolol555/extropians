I wonder if we could use Earth Day to promote our views of saving the
planet (using "ultratechnology" to end pollution and remove the harm
we've done to the planet).  Every year on Earth day we hear the Statist
mantra of mandatory volunteerism (slavery) and the Left plays it up as a
big guilt trip.

<p>
Since we're all Practical Optimists perhaps we can put a positive spin
on the whole Evironmental thing.  Maybe we could get good press out of
it.

<p>
Comments?

<p>
Another thing - does anyone ever put out Extropian press releases?  Do
we have enough of a stand to issue statements?  Should we?  Or would any
attempt to release a statement be mired in continuous argument?

<p>
It would be interesting to look at current events (Yugoslavia,
China-gate, etc.) through the Extropian Principals - How does bombing
Yugoslavia fit in with Practical Optimism or Rational Thinking?

<p>
Maybe we could release a subset of various Extropian views... 

<p>
Couldn't we use some press?
