<a name="1251qlink1">If you need physics problems, get any edition second or later (they found 
most of the errors after the first ed) , of Haliday and Resnick's college 
Physics Text book.  A great  basis for physics, uses calclus where 
appropriate, has lots of good problems, some worked out, some with answers.  
Use Feynmann for the concepts, the way to think about physics. His lectures 
while very clear at times, are very deep.
  H &amp;R, get the mechanics, the problems.</a>  

<p>
As for languages, for technical stuff, C, C++ seems very useful right  now.  
Good luck.  

<p>
Right now I am reading  Greg Egan's "Diaspora" - its excellent.  At age 13, 
read physics, code C, and read science fiction also, to widen your 
imagination.
