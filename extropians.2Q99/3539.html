&gt; Dr. Seuss is brilliant.  One of the truly great ones in our time...  spike<br>

My favorite story by Dr. Seuss was "On Beyond Zebra", which was a fantasy
about letters beyond "Z".  Each fantasy letter was used to spell the names
of fantastic creatures in fantastic places.  Although I knew even as a kid
that it was pretend, it first gave me the idea that there might be hidden
knowledge not generally known to the public.  And as everyone else worked
with their limited knowledge, the "insider" would know more.  This was my
first introduction to Transhumanist thought, back in the '60s!  Through the
discover of additional information, a person could gain better insights and
gain more powers or abilities than the average human.

<p>
This was in first grade.  I quickly learned that I could study ahead in my
schoolbooks to know the material before the teacher taught us.  In
high-school during my Christian phase, I translated my own scriptures from
the original texts to get a more accurate and direct idea of what the Bible
really said.  This lead me into other texts of the time that gave me more
insights than the chosen texts.  I improved my health through nutrition, by
learning how food worked and transcending the average diet.  In college, I
studied Tae Kwan Do (a form of karate) to learn to use my body more
effectively than just general fighting knowledge.  (Maybe that's why I'm not
that into guns.)  When I learned computer programming, I quickly became a
hacker, discovering undocumented commands and hidden capabilities of
computers.  When I worked as an editor on various newsletters, I learned to
go beyond the official story and research the truth, or discover parts of
the story that were left out of the official versions.

<p>
As you can see in my signature, most of these attributes are still with me
today.  I really think that "On Beyond Zebra" was the first book that
changed my life.
