<a name="3588qlink1"><a href="3566.html#3577qlink1">&gt; I do have a substantial problem with Eugene's bias in favor</a><br>
<i>&gt; of pro-gunners, which could constitute a cynical and self-serving</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason for his volunteering as list moderator;...</i><br>

<p>
I have no problem with the occasional personal attack on active
debaters; that's to be expected in an open forum.  I've thrown a
few flames myself, and taken my share in return.  But this wholly
groundless accusation of Eugene, one of the most level heads on
the forum, is inexcusable.  I also have no problem letting an
opponent in a debate have the last word and letting it go; that's
just part of being an adult.  But if I have 24 hours for a parting
shot, I choose to use it here to support the idea of moderation
in general and Eugene in particular.

<p>
In the archives, I find at most 12 total posts by Eugene that
might be construed as gun-related, and not one of them shows any
bias against your expressed opinion (and frequently-expressed at
that--the archive shows 32 posts by you on June 7 alone).  Indeed,</a>
<a name="3597qlink1">Eugene often has a more European-influenced point of view on
political matters than some of the more radical libertarians on
the list (myself included), but I think he would make a fine
moderator, and I have no fear at all that any of my viewpoints
or any opposing viewpoint I want to hear would be selected on
the basis of his political opinions.</a>

<p>
You owe Eugene (at least) an apology.
