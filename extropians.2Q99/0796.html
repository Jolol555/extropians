<a href="0791.html#0796qlink1">&gt; &gt;Even more interesting is non-traditional forms of reproduction, such</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;as in vitro gestation and male pregnancies. They could help erode even</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;more of the old assumptions (if they ever get popular).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My only qualm about this is that many people seem to make the assumption</i><br>
<i>&gt; that just because a desire is biological in nature, i.e. a woman's desire to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have childen, that this desire is somehow wrong or needs to be changed. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly support any woman's desire to not have children, or even to remove</i><br>
<i>&gt; any hormonal influences dealing with this desire; however, I don't think</i><br>
<i>&gt; that makes the desire inherently wrong. Sexual desire is also an</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolutionary tool, but I don't see anyone waiting in line to get rid of it.</i><br>

<p>
Exactly. What I want to see is more options, not that everybody switch
to the "new and improved" ways. 

<p>
I like to sleep, it is very pleasant. Some day I might be able to
consolidate memories and anabolize in a more efficient way, but I
would still like to keep sleeping as an option. A decadent pleasure
when you have time...

<p>
<a href="0791.html#0796qlink2">&gt; &gt;The downside is that we are the weaker sex; I'm not sure about the</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;perturbation thing (never seen any data on it), but we have a higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mortality due to what appears to be a slightly less robust</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;construction. That is why you find plenty of old widows but few old</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;widowers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I saw a very interesting show on TLC the other night about gender</i><br>
<i>&gt; differences, and they came with an interesting reason why woman tend to live</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer than men, even assuming identical lifestyles: historically,</i><br>
<i>&gt; grandmothers are more important to families than grandfathers. Makes sense</i><br>
<i>&gt; when you think about it.</i><br>

<p>
Far too much. I better rewrite my phenotype :-)
