<p>
Two important points:
<br>
1) It is probably impossible, even in principle, to "reset" a human brain to
a previous state.  If there are subsystems that display chaotic behavior
(and there probably are) this operation would require the simultaneous
manipulation of every particle in the brain with infinite precision, and an
equally impossible manipulation of its environment.

<p>
2) Even if you could reset the brain, there is no garuntee that it will give
the same answers the second time around.  It will probably give a very
similar performance, but the combination of truly random natural processes
and chaotic systems means that a repeat performance is not inevitable.
