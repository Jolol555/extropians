Just a short point from a third party.

<p>
The UK has a 95% convition rate for murder and as the general 
population is unarmed<a name="4017qlink5"> any one seen with a gun is treated like a 
</a>
dangerous criminal at is quite often ends up being shot dead by
a police sniper, now that is good enouth protection as fair as I`m
concerned.

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not really; gun ownership doesn't deter crime if people can't carry those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guns with them. Crooks may decide not to break into people's houses</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because they might be armed, but that's not really a problem since they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can just wait until their victims are out on the streets and disarmed by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; law.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Murder rates are higher in those US states which have a concealed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; carry law, where both citizen and criminal is more likely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; armed,  than they are in the U.K., where both is less likely to be.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yet property crime is higher in the UK, as ar assaults. Not to mention that demographically,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the US is far far different from the UK. I'll bet if you compare states with similar</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; demographics to the UK you'll see much more closer comparison.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When a comparison might augur in your favor, you accentuate the </i><br>
<i>&gt; similarities; when it might weigh against you, you stress the </i><br>
<i>&gt; differences,  This may be self-serving, but it is hardly truth-serving.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; According to that DoJ report I posted a URL for, in some areas (assault</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and property crimes) it has much higher crime levels than America; this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is probably one reason why the anti-gunners stick to murder rates. It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible the DoJ are fudging the figures to make America look better, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they appear to have gone to some trouble to get accurate statistics by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking both at official police reports and victim surveys... and they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would seem to have a vested interest in making it look worse to get more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; funding.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Murder is the irreversible crime; it is the one which forever revokes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; one's right to life, liberty, property and pursuit of happiness, as well</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; as the one to keep and bear arms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Thats right, but killing a criminal is not murder, and I'd much rather it were him and not me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and I'd much rather trust my protection to myself than to.... well since the government is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; liable for protecting me, then I have no-one to trust but myself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd much rather him not have the gun, if I can keep it out of his </i><br>
<i>&gt; hands; even if I'm armed with a tommygun, one bullet from behind </i><br>
<i>&gt; will kill me and I'd most likely never see it coming.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Here's a question: What do the gun controllers propose to give me in services in exchange for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; my guns? Will they provide bodyguards? NO? Will they lock up anyone who ever exhibited a hint</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of deviancy? NO? Will they pay for the prisons they will need to enforce the fascist state</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they want to impose? NO? Well, then, no deal.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can have yours if you're not a violent criminal, a spouse and/or </i><br>
<i>&gt; child abuser, mentally deficient and/or deranged, or a child.  Then, </i><br>
<i>&gt; society shouldn't need your criminal, insane, abusive or underaged </i><br>
<i>&gt; permission.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; definition of fascism:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; from Encyclopedia.com:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "philosophy of government that glorifies the nation-state at the expense</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of the individual...  Fascism generally gains support by promising social</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; justice to discontented elements of the working and middle classes, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; social order to powerful financial interests."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Start enforcing the laws we already have before you come to me to ask that I give up more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; freedoms...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You accuse me of asking for what I have not asked for (unless you </i><br>
<i>&gt; belong in one of the categories of my list, in which case you are </i><br>
<i>&gt; not responsible enough to be trusted in the midst of the populace </i><br>
<i>&gt; with the possession of mass and at-a-distance deadly force, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore your permission is irrelevant, for you cannot responsibly </i><br>
<i>&gt; either grant or withhold it concerning this issue).</i><br>
