As far as immortality is concerned, I think those who are set up well 
with their finances will get a piece of the pie. It may very well be 
that those who arn't won't be able to afford the cost of cell repair 
and further life extending procedures. 
<br>
Also, after the precurser distribution of nanomachines from 
manufacturing companies, and we all own one in our own homes, the 
need for riches, as a cash commodity could decrease. A household 
nanomachine will create object's of need for us,(food, furniture 
fabrication, and other physical objects) therefore eliminating the 
need for shopping. There will be atomatic cleaners, showers, and  
available cures. This creates questions for the work force also, will 
people still decide to work, how much will be needed? This will shut 
down a lot of development of tiny technologies. The economy as we 
know it, will have to find an alternative route to adjust to these 
new technological revolutions.   
<br>
There will be ethical complications, the difference between rich and 
poor where life is concerned. 
<br>
The role of the government, how will it be played out in regulation 
and promotion. 
<br>
The rate of accelerated change will effect how readily society can 
adapt.
<br>
The difference in user's as opposed to constructors will be major.
Each of these issues will effect the whole economic scenario.
Will money even be relevant in the future or a collectors item?

<i>&gt;&gt;Immortality would give everyone a chance to let compound interest </i><br>
turn their pennies into dollars, and their dollars into riches.  Of 
course, if it becomes common for people to retire and live off their 
interest the economy is going to start looking pretty strange.

<i>&gt;Interest rates are set by supply and demand.  If almost everyone were</i><br>
<i>&gt;trying to lend substantial amounts, and almost no one creditworthy </i><br>
was willing to borrow similar amounts, real interest rates for sound 
loans would be extraordinarily low compared to what we are used to.  
Likewise for return on capital invested in stocks.

<a href="0684.html#0703qlink3">&gt;In the economic world, immortality already exists in a sense. </a><br>
