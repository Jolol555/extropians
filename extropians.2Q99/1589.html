I really haven't looked into the details of their scheme at
all, but from what I understand it is based on a Java client
that basically operates in a similiar fashion to a PGP client...
I don't think unencrypted messages are stored anywhere. It
is encrypted by one client, sent to their servers (in Vancouver
I believe), and just held there in their encrypted form until
the recipient views it on their client. The only service they
are providing besides the client software is a web-based email
system like any other. But I could be totally wrong. There was
a thread on this on Slashdot a few days ago with plenty of
comments if you want to read that.
