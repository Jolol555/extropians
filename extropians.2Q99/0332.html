This reminds me of a skit I saw on Laugh-In many years ago.  

<p>
Goldie Hawn:  (in a bright, chirpy, airhead voice) Guess what, Dan!  I
joined the Dumb People's Club! 

<p>
Dan Rowan:  The Dumb People's Club?  What's that, Goldie? 

<p>
Goldie:  Well, it's this club.  I paid $25,000 to join, and I got a
membership card and a certificate. 

<p>
&lt;pause&gt; 

<p>
Dan:  Is that all?  

<p>
Goldie:  Yes.  

<p>
Dan:  Now wait a minute, Goldie...   You paid $25,000 to join this club,
and all you got was a membership card and a certificate?  

<p>
Goldie:  Yes.  

<p>
Dan:  Goldie, you've got to be really dumb to join a club like that.  

<p>
Goldie:  Yes!

<a name="0333qlink1">Eliezer, you should get together with Mike Lorrey.  The same millionaires
who would invest in the Lorrey Drive would also invest in the Singularity. 
You could form a club, called the Science Fiction Investor's Club.  Charge
them $25,000,000 to join, and give them a membership card and a
</a>certificate.
