I'm not absolutely sure about this..but I think that Japan discovered 
<a name="2267qlink1">gunpowder a loooooong time ago.  They supressed it.  The reasoning was that 
their culture was based on the Samurai....swordsmen. A swordsman is not much 
good against a gunman.</a>

<p>
Later of course they ran up against a culture which had not suppressed 
gunpowder and were dogmeat.  The moral of the story being survival of the 
fittest. Fittest being the biggest boys with the biggest toys...
