It would be more accurate to say we could bomb every major city - although
even that is misleading, because most modern cities are too spread out to be
destroyed by any reasonable number of small bombs.  To actually be able to
destroy our civilization we would have to build much bigger bombs, and
deploy a lot more of them.  Even then there would be survivors in rural
areas, and it probably wouldn't take more than a few hundred years for them
to rebuild.

We might be able to completely eradicate ourselves using nuclear weapons,
but figuring out a way to do it would take a lot of R&amp;D on dirty,
ultra-high-yield devices that wouldn't be good for anything else.  While
possible in principle, that seems like a wildly unlikely scenario at this
point.
