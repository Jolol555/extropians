Billy Brown summarized:
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="0742.html#0749qlink1">&gt; 1) A future in which lifespans become very long (&gt;200 years).</a><br>
<i>&gt; 2) At least reasonably good (by current standards) economic conditions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) A population in which a majority of people over age 50 wish to retire.</i><br>

<p>
Let's not get so caught up in compound interest rates that we forget the
underlying manufacture and distribution of "stuff".  The real question
is the teenagers who are actually working will be productive enough,
thanks to ever-increasing technology, to support all the old fogies.

<p>
Actually, I expect that once the economy gets up to that stage, most
people will invest their weekly allowances so they don't have to work as
teenagers either.  One of two things will happen; either you'll get a
permanent class of poor workers kept poor by some huge number of
regulations, or the work will be done by people who enjoy it, or the
economy will strike a balance at the point where labor is so valuable
that people come out of retirement once a year to work for a few hours
and buy themselves a mansion.
