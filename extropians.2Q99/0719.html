Oh well.  I had noticed that K. Eric Drexler, on a web page, has a list
of patents, and the solar sail is one of them (4,614,319).  There are
already solar sails in production.  In 1991, for high school debate, we
had a space exploration plan with solar sails.

<p>
I guess we are around at the right time for the next century of things.
Considering life extension, we might be around for the century after
that, etcetera.

matter-to-energy transformation.  Again, this is barring
extra-dimensional sources of power.</a>

<p>
I've always been very fond of space, it is a romantic ideal, the
so-called "final frontier."
