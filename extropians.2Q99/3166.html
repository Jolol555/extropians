<a href="3016.html#3166qlink1">&gt; The problem is that they have to destroy resources in their own universe</a><br>
<i>&gt; to do this, shoving useful matter and energy down the throat of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; black hole.  Not to mention the cost of moving stars around or whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; is necessary to create them.  It's not going to be easy, so this is far</i><br>
<i>&gt; from a cost free endeavor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No doubt some people would be interested in doing this, but it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; questionable whether it can rival natural processes in terms of creating</i><br>
<i>&gt; black holes.</i><br>

I always thought the leading theory was that contraction or entropy death of
our universe would force any able civilisations to bail out....what do you
think of this?
<br>
Also, what is the evidence for natural black holes constituting a path to
another universe? Does anyone know? Perhaps they lead to nothing or to a
base-state reality within which the universes form.....
