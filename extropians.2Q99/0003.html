<p>
I have.  I proposed the single legless female astronaut notion, but they may

<p>
have assumed I was joking.  I wasnt.  They are focussed on the flags-and-
footprints scenario, and they dont want those footprints to be in
the form of knuckles-buns-knuckles-buns...

<i>&gt;Would a bigger car have helped?  (Very extropian)</i><br>

There was no humor intended in the post, this being
very inappropriate in dealing with injury and death.  Very
sorry to hear of your accident, glad you survived Gina.
So sorry to hear about your friend.  I lost my grandfather
the same way.  A bigger car would have saved him.

<p>
Yes.  She has something *I* lack.

<p>
<i>&gt;From another post:  The arguments about men are better at this, women</i><br>
are better at that are all beside the point: women have a corner
on the market when it comes to reproduction.  The best
Mars colonist will be a Mars native.

<p>
<i>&gt; Have you considered any genetic or cloning alternatives to your</i><br>
<i>&gt; medically crude ideas?</i><br>

<p>
Yes.  I dont see the advantages of cloning, but genetic
engineering might be used to make a smaller astronaut.
But this brings up a point that is contained in some other
posts as well, but I will put here:


<OL>
  <li>  Who believes we should wait for nanotech to start a Mars colony?

<a name="0464qlink2"><a name="0463qlink2">  <li>  Who believes the point is to *have* an exocolony before these
other things come online?</a></a>
<a name="0464qlink3"><a name="0463qlink3">  <li>  Who believes we have the technology now and should start now,
even if it requires great discomfort and sacrifice on the part of
the first colonist(s)?</a></a></a>


</OL>
<p>
Im a no-no-yes-yes to these 4 questions.  spike
