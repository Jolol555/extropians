<a href="1534.html#1572qlink1">&gt; I'm a bit worried about all this talk of Jupiter sized brains (although</a><br>
<i>&gt; I'm guilty of it myself). </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wouldn't such a thing be a target? If someone was annoying you who was</i><br>
<i>&gt; dependent on a Jupiter sized brain, then wouldn't you be tempted to lob</i><br>
<i>&gt; a couple of fusion bombs at it (sorry all you pacifists out there). </i><br>

<p>
Of course the J-brain would have appropriate defenses (like a massive cloud
of nanites and other bots surrounding it), so you'd need a lot more than a 
couple of fusion bombs to destroy it, certainly if you want to survive the
encounter.
 
<p>
<a href="1534.html#1572qlink2">&gt; Also, in my experience, computers have been getting *smaller* as time</a><br>
<i>&gt; wends its way towards whatever it wends its way towards. While we're all</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing this "my brain's bigger than yours" stuff, transhumans might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; more impressed by tiny, weeny little brains. "I've got the new</i><br>
<i>&gt; google-flops processor(s) running my brain, it's made out of quarks, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the size of the head of a match - oh wait, I've dropped it, hey,</i><br>
<i>&gt; guys, can you help me find my brain, it's here somewhere, no, don't step</i><br>
<i>&gt; there, aaarrgghhhh *gurgle*).</i><br>

<p>
Right, and that's why you need if not a big brain, then at least a big *head*
(so that no-one will step on it, or more realistically so that it isn't disassembled
by a couple of stray nanites, vaporized by a laser beam etc.)
