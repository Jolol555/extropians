</a><i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Destruction of the library probably helped the development of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;scientific technological culture, because the loss of its knowledge,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;right or wrong, inspired generations of men to conduct original</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;research using the scientific method to 'recover' that 'lost'</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;knowledge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Huh? I don't see much evidence for this. Among the humanities it has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; indeed caused much research, trying to piece together the *original*</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Illiad or _The State_, but among the natural sciences there was never</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the same recover-mentality, not even during the renaissance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On the contrary, the whole alchemy/chemistry area developed out of</i><br>
&gt;'recovering' the secrets of the ancient philosphers. 

<p>
Ok, this area seems to fit with a more backward looking style of science. 

<p>
<a href="1167.html#1178qlink2">&gt; Middle age europe</a><br>
<i>&gt; lost the secret of roman concrete, and european kings all wanted to</i><br>
<i>&gt; know how to build structures like the pyramids using the magical</i><br>
<i>&gt; methods that myth purported they were built with.</i><br>

<p>
The architects and masons did indeed look backwards to antique
architecture long before the humanists did. However, I have not seen
much evidence that they were trying to re-create the lost knowledge,
they were rather trying to create something that worked and drew
inspiration from the roman constructions. As for finding the magical
building methods, as far as I know there were no attempts to do them.

<p>
<a href="1167.html#1178qlink3">&gt; Moreover, the scarce information left about the lost 'Atlantis'</a><br>
<i>&gt; inspired Columbus in his quest for the new world.</i><br>

<p>
What is the evidence for this being a more important factor than
finding a trade route to India?

<pre>
<a name="1180qlink2">&gt;If there had been more substantial supporting 'evidence' for the
&gt;Ptolemaic solar system, Copernicus and Galileo might have been
&gt;supressed even more violently than they were.

</pre>
<p>
No, rather the opposite. Their claims would have been less convincing,
and hence less of a threat. So they might not have been suppressed,
but instead their ideas could have remained forgotten for a long time.</a>
