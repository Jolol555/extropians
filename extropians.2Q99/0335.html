If you smoke nicotine cigarettes, and switch to cigarettes with absolutely no
additives, you will notice hard withdrawal symptoms.  The reason why, I conjecture,
is that some cigarette additives are physically addictive.  Nicotine is physically
addictive, but I have noticed its withdrawal symptoms were less unpleasant than
withdrawal from cigarettes with additives.

I would think if one were to go on a caffeine fast, ie, stopping caffeine
consumption, there would be less of a diuretic effect.  "Placebo effect."  Drink a
lot of water after a hard night of alcohol drinking or the next morning, that is
where one needs rehydration.

Caffeine is good and everywhere, it is possible to absolutely stop drinking
caffeinated beverages after a period of high levels of consumption for years.  I
drank coffee for a couple years, then stopped for a couple years, and do drink it
every now and then.

<p>
The same goes for anything else except food, water, and air.  One can theoretically
span long periods of time without food, although those with sugar imbalances may
find it more difficult.  Water is absolutely necessary every couple of days at
least, two or three liters a day at least is recommended.  Five minutes or less
without air leads to unconsciouness, more than ten or twenty leads to brain damage.
These are survival requirements, not recommended dosages.

<p>
Fasting as a means to self-enlightenment is not recommended, but it is enlightening.

<p>
Life can be said to be addictive, in that it is habit-forming to respirate.

<p>
What's the difference between a good habit and a bad habit, and who is to decide?
To each his own.
