Harvey: Thank you for your graceful response. I *was* taken aback by the
tone of your comments. However, I can understand very well how frustration
combined with overwork can alter one's normal responses.

Personally, I don't find this frustrating, as I don't expect the same
people to stick around on the same list for 7 or 8 years. Certainly I enjoy
seeing high-quality posters such as Hal Finney staying with us over the
long haul. But if folks are focusing on other areas, I dont this as a
problem. It may actually be a sign of progress. Just one example--one of
the early list subscribers, Eric Raymond has been much in the news due to
his open source campaign. (Today's news was that he was amazed to be
invited to come and talk at Microsoft!) If we have some more focused lists
(while keeping an exi-general or exi-social list), some people might stay
with those lists longer since they will be more efficient.

Certainly. Though much *does* get done. The results may not always be
obvious since they move off-list. ExI has never managed to acquire the
resources to fulfil all its goals, though we are continuing with the highly
popular Extro conferences. Extro 4 will demonstrate an earlier idea by an
ExI member that has come to a rather impressive fruition: Dr. Christopher
Heward, who spoke at the first two Extro conferences on life extension,
will be giving the first public presentation on a new, very well-funded
company that offers a unique, individualized program based on the
"biometrics" idea he spoke about at those past events.

<p>
Some of the progress being made is subtle and diffuse, yet real. The ideas
discussed and developed in Extropian circles are rapidly becoming discussed
and even accepted far more broadly. (The recent note about George Will
further confirmed this.) Even though ExI lacks the resources to do much
that it would like to do, it has acted as a center for information that has
spread out through numerous media outlets. In addition, ExI continues to
serve as a network for individuals who are achieving many things in their
own fields.

<p>
Currently ExI's most important project is the Extro 4 conference: Biotech
Futures. I would love to hear suggestions as to how to leverage this event
to communicate our thinking to others, how to follow up on the event, etc.

<p>
[If you are new to the list and don't know about the conference, please
visit our website and check out the program and list of speakers.]

<p>
Onward!
