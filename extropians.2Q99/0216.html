It would be interesting if you could isolate the profit incentive part of
this problem.  Not that profit incentive is bad, but it would emphasize
the buyer beware part of medicine.  I expect that most skeptic extropians
are able to pick and choose medical advice enough to result in very
different statistics.  But these are very surprising statistics for
sheeple.

I'm 40 and have seen a doctor only a handful of times in my life.  I've
never had a physical exam.  My time has come now though, the last four
times I've checked my blood pressure, it been pretty high and I've been
suffering from sleep apnea which probably is the cause of the high blood
pressure.  So now I'm faced with the need to research the following:


<OL>
  <li>  What kinds of test should I request that are sometimes not given
routinely - e.g. early detection of cancer? 

  <li>  Whats the likely medicine to be prescribed to lower blood pressure and
is it often mis-prescribed.

  <li>  In my case, If I weigh more than 165 lbs., I have sleep apnea, under
165 lbs., I do not.  Right now I'm at 178 lbs.  I have to find a
short-term solution until I can loose the weight.  Many times, I find
myself afraid to go back to sleep at night.  I anticipate that the doctor
will want to go the surgical route and he'll probably dismiss my weight
theory as bullshit although I'm absolutely certain of it.  Believe me,
I've YO-YOed enough to know.  My weight gain simply occurs mostly in my
face and throat.  So I'm thinking maybe I should counter his
recommendation for surgery with a request for the apnea machine.


</OL>
<p>
These kinds of things have to be considered and planned ahead of time to
make effective use of medicine.  I see that now more than ever.  I'd
appreciate any advice about my specifics or even appropriate URL's.  I
think it to be on-topic for us to discuss how to make use of medicine to
*effectively* extend life.
