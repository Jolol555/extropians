<i>&gt;&gt; Sounds reasonable. But medical and avionics systems have to deal with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; fairly well defined environments; the number of things that might be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;thrown at ufog in an ordinary home (just imagine what the toddlers do)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; are astronomical. Hmm, that actually suggests an ufog problem: getting</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; foglets into liquids where they shouldn't be - how can we guarantee</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that none of the fog gets into our food?</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1830.html#1839qlink2">&gt;I had the impression that utility fog, despite the name, was more of a</a><br>
<i>&gt;gel than a fog.  It does not have free-floating foglets, but rather it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;a contiguous material which flows around the inhabitants, always keeping</i><br>
<i>&gt;a small distance from them.  It has lasers which constantly track the</i><br>
<i>&gt;eyes of the people living within it so that any desired scene can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;projected to them, making the fog invisible.  It might not even have</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be extremely close to the inhabitants but perhaps could be several</i><br>
<i>&gt;inches away, much of the time.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1830.html#1839qlink3">&gt;There will presumably be pieces constantly breaking off due to failures,</a><br>
<i>&gt;so it is a legitimate concern that these be inert and unharmful when</i><br>
<i>&gt;breathed or swallowed.  Hopefully the pieces would be very tiny and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;rate of such failures would be small enough that the health problems</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be minor.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1843qlink2">   Nutrients could  be absorbed directly through the skin
and mucous membranes  to eliminate the need for eating.</a> At the other end of
<a name="1843qlink3"> the spectrum, bodily wastes would be absorbed as they
are released by the U-fog.</a>  The U-fog would also be a breathing medium that
<a name="1843qlink4"> adjusted itself as required to supply oxygen at times of peak activity.
