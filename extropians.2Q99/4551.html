<a name="4593qlink1">Wow -- this is the first time I've *ever* heard this</a> sentiment
expressed by anyone but myself.  I must admit that I am stupified
that more men don't feel this way.  I don't think I'm all that
unusual in terms of the degree or intensity of my sex drive, but
I find it extremely annoying.  It feels like I'm "trapped in the
body of an ape".

Actually, when I think about it, I think Elvis Costello has a song
expressing frustration that he couldn't turn off his libido, but
the title and lyrics escape me.

I do know that there's a drug called "Depo-provera", which is used
as a contraceptive in women, but when used on men, it lowers their
testosterone level.  This is the drug used on sex offenders when
you hear about "chemical castration".  I've heard of studies that
have indicated that use of this drug is even *more* effective at
reducing recidivism in sex offenders than castration is.  I think
it has some nasty side affects, but I really don't know.  Of course,
you can only get it by prescription, and I think most doctors would
be hesitant to prescribe it.

<p>
Good luck, and let me know if you discover anything useful!
