But perhaps we would say that the causal

<a name="0033qlink1"><a name="0026qlink1">I think this is the idea behind David Chalmer's recent definition of 
what it means for something to be an implementation of a program (or 
computation). The causal structure of the implementation has to match 
the structure of the program. I don't have his book handy at the 
moment however.</a></a>

<a name="0033qlink2"><a name="0026qlink2">Another example we may consider: Suppose we have a computer running 
an upload for 10 seconds. Suppose we computer has discrete time. Then 
we could in principle construct one computer (or one RAM chip) for 
each time step of the simulation; and we could load each of these RAM 
with the data that the RAM in the original computer had at the 
corresponding time. We can place all these RAM chips in one long row. 
In some sense, we then have what looks like the same structure 
instanciated in two places in spacetime -- once as a spatiotemporal 
process, and once as a spatial pattern.<a name="0103qlink1"> We presumably want to say 
that only the former gives rise to a consciousness. And the relevant 
difference seems to be that in the case of the process, the various 
states are causally connected, whereas with the spatial pattern that 
is not so.</a></a></a>
