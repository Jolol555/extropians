	i think the benchmark is pretty straightforward: if a behavior would 
benifit you in your opinion, then to take part in the behavior would be 
selfish. i thought altruism would be the opposite of this:  if a behavior 
would not benifit you in your opinion, then to take part in the behavior 
would be altrustic.  the examples you gave would all be of selfish behavior. 
buuuut, maybe im misdefining words... ::checks dictionary to make sure::
