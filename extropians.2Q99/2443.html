<a name="2464qlink2">The difficulty with non-lethal protective technologies, like stun guns, is the
dosage. The voltage/amperage that it takes to immobilize the biggest person has
a high risk of killing outright the smallest person. Defaulting your settings
for the smallest person will merely piss off the big person who is likely to
hurt you most.</a>

<p>
A good non-lethal tech would  have to be a smart dart that uses body capacitance
<a name="2464qlink3">to measure the mass of the offender it has been injected in, to dispense the
correct dosage of whatever it is using to immobilize that individual.</a>

<p>
<a name="2464qlink4">Promoting such technolgies, IMHO, once they get into the hands of criminals (as
they will, since they are non-lethal technologies, it should be easier for a
person to get ahold of them), will cause the rates of robberies and rapes to
skyrocket, since criminals will love these technologies.</a> They get to commit
their acts while not harming their victims, which shows how considerate they
are, right, so they are likely to be sentenced to far shorter sentences if and
when they are caught.
