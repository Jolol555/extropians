&gt; One thing that interested me about the Oracle was that she was wrong about <br>
&gt; Neo being The One (and ONLY that).<br>

<p>
Actually, if you remember right after Neo saves Trinity from her falling 
helicopter, Morpheus asks Trinity believes if Neo is the one. Neo says that 
the Oracle told him he was not the one, to which Morpheus replies that the 
oracle told him what "he needed to hear". This , I think, ties back into what 
Morpheus continually told Neo when they were sparring. "Don't try to hit me, 
just hit me". And " DOn't think "x", just do "x"". He needed to prove to 
himself what (or who) he was. And, in some way, the oracle telling him he was 
the one would not have let him do that (probably having something to do with 
freeing his mind)
