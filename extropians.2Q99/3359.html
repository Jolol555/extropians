<a href="3343.html#3359qlink1">&gt; My neighbours don't have guns.  No one I know has a gun. I live in a</a><br>
<i>&gt; country where guns are banned.  I like it here. I think anyone who wants</i><br>
<i>&gt; to live in a country where everyone has guns is mad.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3373qlink1">Tough restrictions on guns is one thing, but the real problem is IMO
the general anti-personal empowerment attitude which is the driving
force behind gun bans.</a> The same people who deny citizens the
<a name="3495qlink2">right to defend themselves with lethal force, are also very likely to
deny them other rights too (like the right to carry non-lethal weapons 
like mace or stun guns,</a> or even worse, the very right to defend
<a name="3495qlink3">yourself at all when attacked by a criminal -- this is already quite
common where I live).</a> They tend to see civilians as incompetent 
fools who should be treated like little children, which means that 
politicians will have (even) less respect for the public's opinion.
Is it a cooncidence that the Swiss, who own guns freely, also
have a general referendum (a real one, where the people's
decision counts), which is about as democratic as one can
get, while here in Holland for example most politicians are 
openly repulsed by the very idea of a referendum (and the 
sheeple agree, unbelievable!).
