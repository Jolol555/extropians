<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;treatment we don't normally get) doesn't help.  People get things like </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;appendicitis, pneumonia in the young, and gangrene which were major risks </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;in the past but very rarely die of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Sure we are lots healthier now than in the past.  The question is how much</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;credit medicine deserves for that.  Lots of other things have changed </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;besides medicine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's why I picked those.  Gangrene and appendicitis still have nearly </i><br>
<i>&gt;100% mortality if not treated.  Pneumonia is generally survivable by the </i><br>
<i>&gt;young but still often lethal if not treated.</i><br>

<a name="0216qlink2">The question here is about the marginal health consequences of medicine,
*averaging* over all the things medicine does.  Some things may help, but
when averaged in with other things that hurt, the average could be zip.</a>

<a href="0078.html#0181qlink2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A recent analysis of 5 million Medicare patients, using regional </a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;spending variations of a factor of two (controlling for lots of stuff), </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;found that any mortality benefit of spending in the last six months of </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;life is less than a one part in a thousand. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;That sounds like a biased sample.  People who die within six months are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;people for whom treatment has failed.  If medical treatment works, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;won't show up in the sample.  Am I missing something?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;It is a random sample of all Medicare patients.  It looks at 5000 hospital</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;regions in the country, and predicts total mortality in each region from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a long list of features, one of which is how much is spent there in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;last six months of life.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I wouldn't expect survival from a specific cause to be related to </i><br>
<i>&gt;last-six-months spending; treated survivors are excluded while patients with </i><br>
<i>&gt;other disease are included. ... My concern with excluding survivors remains.  </i><br>

<p>
This study looks at total mortality in each region, and everyone in a 
region eventually dies.  Everyone also has some spending level in their 
last six months.  I don't see a selection bias here.   

<p>
<a href="0085.html#0181qlink3">&gt;Statistical significance is a real problem with medical studies;</a><br>
<i>&gt;some require hundreds of thousands of patients.  </i><br>

<p>
The figure I gave you, of less than one part in a thousand mortality 
benefit, was a 95% confidence level figure.   5 million people is enough
to see real effects.  Consider also that people have seen effects 
of fat, excersize, social status, etc. with far less data.
