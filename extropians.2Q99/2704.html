Hey Mormon dudes,

<p>
	I saw this post between you two indicating your involvement
with Mormonism.  I'm very excited to know you, and to hear about some
of this stuff you are experiencing, John G, and your advice, John Q.

<p>
	I was raised in the LDS church, went on a mission and all, and
actually am still an active member (mostly because of my family.)
However, an atheist extropian would be a much better description of my
beliefs.

<p>
	Did I hear you right, John G, your an active Mormon interested
in Cryonics?  And I thought I was the only one!  I'm in the process of
signing up right now.  I've lost my temple recommend but I'm not sure
if that is the specific reason even though I'm sure it is a big part.

<p>
	And your wife is LDS John Q?  My wife is very much a totally
convinced mormon.  I basically only got to church to try to support
her and the rest of the family.  I more or less consider myself an
atheist investigating the church that, in spite of studying mormonism
my entire life just can't seem to "get it".

<p>
	Anyway, It's great to hear about you guys.  I'd love to hear
more about your feelings, experiences, about life, extropy, Mormonism
and so on and so forth if either of you have some time some day.
