<a href="3337.html#3338qlink1">&gt; PS - I am preparing to undergo lasik surgery in several months, has</a><br>
<i>&gt; anyone here any experience with it they would care to relate?</i><br>

<p>
I had this procedure done last week.  It involves slicing open a small
flap at the front of the cornea, zapping a hollow into the cornea with the
laser for a few seconds, then letting the flap close.  Doing it this way,
with the tissue removed from under the flap it heals relatively quickly.

<p>
It was very fast and easy, only took about 10 minutes in the operating
room, then resting for the rest of the day.  I could drive and do most
activities the next day.

<p>
My doctor does about a hundred of these every month so he has a lot
of experience.  He does both eyes at once; many doctors will do one eye
and then wait to do the other.

<p>
My distance vision is now very good, 20-25 in the left eye and 20-15
in the right, although the doctor said I could expect it to continue to
vary somewhat over the next few weeks.  This is much better than I was
getting with my glasses and contacts, both of which had somewhat out of
date prescriptions.

<p>
I haven't had any noticeable discomfort, the worst is that my eyes feel a
little dry from time to time, and I put in eye drops then.

<p>
The only problem I have found is that my near vision has become worse.
I have run into some problems reading up close in the last couple of years
(I am 43).  Since the operation it is worse and I now have to use reading
glasses almost all the time in order to read if the print is at all fine
or the light somewhat dim.  I think this is because my contacts were weak
before and so they were undercorrecting my nearsightedness.  I notice this
more in the evening when I am tired.

<p>
Aside from this I am very happy with the result.  The other night I walked
into the bathroom at bedtime and opened my contact lens solutions and
prepared to do my nightly ritual of removing and cleaning my contacts.
Suddenly I remembered I didn't have contacts any more.  It's nice not
to have to worry about things like that.
