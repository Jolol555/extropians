<a name="0118qlink1"><i>&gt; The fact that [Ventura] a professional wrestler - perhaps the only</i><br>
<a href="0047.html#0056qlink1">&gt; class outside of used car dealer less trusted in the US than politicians</a><br>
<i>&gt; (in fact people enjoy the fake soap-opera camp) cannot be a counted as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; factor that worked for him.</i><br>

<p>
I might have thought at one time that Mr. Dees had at least /some/
tenuous connection to reality, but I no longer have to give him the
benefit of that doubt.

<p>
Can you honestly say with a straight face that Mr. Ventura's job
as an entertainer had /nothing/ to do with his getting elected?
And I suppose Clint Eastwood became mayor of Carmel on the strength
of his zoning plans, and Sonny Bono went to congress because he
had some good ideas on the economy?  Was Shirley Temple really
the best candidate for ambassadorship to Ghana?</a>

<p>
<a name="0118qlink2">In modern American politics, name recognition matters, and money
matters, and ideas are a distant third if that.  This is the
natural and inevitable result of that moral perversion we call
democracy: give the majority the power to rule everyone, and they
use that power to enforce mediocrity upon us all at gunpoint.</a>
<a name="0118qlink3">It is not possible to work "within the system" to dismantle the
system.  Since democracy itself is repugnant, it must be replaced.</a>
<a name="0118qlink4">My preferred method of doing that is non-violent "underthrow":
either simply leave and start society somewhere else, or else
acquire sufficient economic power that the government becomes
impotent and irrelevant.  E-commerce has potential for the latter,
so I am enthusiastic that might happen.</a>  But if neither of those
<a name="0118qlink5">work--if the democracy tries to force you in line with its guns--
then free and honest people have no choice but to shoot back.</a>
