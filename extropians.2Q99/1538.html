Universal Assemblers
<br>
These second-generation nanomachines - built of more than just proteins - 
will do all that proteins can do, and more. In particular, some will serve 
as improved devices for assembling molecular structures. Able to tolerate 
acid or vacuum, freezing or baking, depending on design, enzyme-like 
second-generation machines will be able to use as "tools" almost any of the 
reactive molecules used by chemists - but they will wield them with the 
precision of programmed machines. They will be able to bond atoms together 
in virtually any stable pattern, adding a few at a time to the surface of a 
workpiece until a complex structure is complete. Think of such nanomachines 
as assemblers.

<p>
Because assemblers will let us place atoms in almost any reasonable 
arrangement (as discussed in the Notes), they will let us build almost 
anything that the laws of nature allow to exist. In particular, they will 
let us build almost anything we can design - including more assemblers. The 
consequences of this will be profound, because our crude tools have let us 
explore only a small part of the range of possibilities that natural law 
permits. Assemblers will open a world of new technologies.

<p>
Advances in the technologies of medicine, space, computation, and production 
- and warfare - all depend on our ability to arrange atoms. With assemblers, 
we will be able to remake our world or destroy it. So at this point it seems 
wise to step back and look at the prospect as clearly as we can, so we can 
be sure that assemblers and nanotechnology are not a mere futurological 
mirage.
