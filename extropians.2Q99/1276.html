the

<p>
<a name="1313qlink2">your railway example requires vast amounts of infrastructure before it

an inch.


<p>
I'll pose the question again: can we easily move monolithic chunks of
rock
<br>
weighing thousands of tons?
<br>
In fact, I'll be specific: could we move the lower courses of the temple
of
<br>
Jupiter at Baalbek to, say, Rome?



<p>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink6">&gt; You can load a thousand-ton rock onto a carrying platform by building</a><br>
a ramp
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink7">&gt; and using a couple of locomotive engines to drag it (if you want to be</a><br>

<p>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink8">&gt; sophisticated, you can lubricate the ramp or put rollers under the</a><br>
block to
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink9">&gt; make it move more easily).  You haul it off the platform and into</a><br>
position
<br>
<i>&gt; the same way.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1313qlink3">Now, do you know this for a fact? That this is how it would be done? I'm

<p>
thinking your rock can't flex a lot, so what about the bit where it goes
from
</a>
<br>
the inclined plane of the ramp to the horizontal plane of the carriage?
Won't it
<br>
crack?


<p>
<a name="1313qlink4">I'm not being contrary, I just want to make sure that we are dealing
with known
<br>
engineering principles here, not lots of people playing "I think" games
</a>
based on
<br>
spurious theories of modern capability.


<p>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink10">&gt; Note, by the way, that this is all 19th-century technology.  We could</a><br>
<i>&gt; probably scale it up quite a bit if we needed to for some reason -</i><br>
probably
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink11">&gt; to millions of tons, and possible to tens of millions.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="1313qlink5">I'm not aware of how we could lift a million-ton object.
You haven't suggested how we could lift a thousand ton object?  Anyone
know what
</a>
<br>
the carrying capacity of the largest crane in the world is?


<p>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink12">&gt; &gt; Um, please read my reply to Michael Lorry. I mean the foundations</a><br>
are
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink13">&gt; &gt; extremely square, edges and corners all line up, etc., to a very</a><br>
tiny
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink14">&gt; &gt; degree of error.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; OK.  Different problem, but the answer is the same - we can shape</i><br>
matter to
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink15">&gt; pretty much any degree of precision you want to pay for.  Commercial</a><br>
<i>&gt; construction techniques aren't up to the job, but that is only because</i><br>
no
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink16">&gt; one wants to pay for that kind of precision anymore.</a><br>

<p>
Aha.  So it is a cost factor, not a doability factor.



<p>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink17">&gt; With scientific equipment you can easily measure off your dimensions</a><br>
with an
<br>
<i>&gt; accuracy of a few millimetres, regardless of how big the structure is.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink18">&gt; Measuring exact angles is also no big deal - telescope aiming systems</a><br>
<i>&gt; routinely point objects in a desired direction with an error of &lt;0.1</i><br>
<i>&gt; arc-second, which is far bette than the pyramids.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you can make the required measurements, actually building to them</i><br>
is just
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink19">&gt; a matter of money.  Either you spend extra time carefully placing your</a><br>
forms
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink20">&gt; before pouring concrete, or you come back afterwards and cut away</a><br>
everything
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink21">&gt; that isn't supposed to be there.</a><br>

<p>
Right. Hmmmm. So maybe this engineer was a tame engineer quoted to make
the
<br>
ancients look mysterious.
<br>
Hmmm.


<p>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink22">&gt; The fact that a TV show dedicated to spreading the "ancient wonder</a><br>
workers"
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink23">&gt; meme was able to find someone to quote really doesn't carry much</a><br>
weight.
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink24">&gt; You can find *someone* who will agree with just about anything.  I</a><br>
believe
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink25">&gt; the Flat Earth Society has a couple of members who are engineers, too.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="1313qlink6">Um. So much for that bright idea.
<br>
I realise that you can get talking heads to say anything, but</a> I would
assume
<br>
<a name="1313qlink7">that a show which is trying to convince people of dubious stuff would
make extra
</a>
<br>
effort to get qualified talking heads.


<p>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink26">&gt; The important question is what the general consensus of the experts</a><br>
is.  I
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink27">&gt; looked into this several years ago, and what I found was that the</a><br>
general
<br>
<i>&gt; consensus among archaeologists is that there is no big mystery to be</i><br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink28">&gt; explained.  In Egypt, Greece and the Middle East they've worked out</a><br>
exactly
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink29">&gt; how just about everything was built, and can sometimes even trace the</a><br>
spread
<br>
<a href="1218.html#1276qlink30">&gt; of new techniques from one culture to another across the course of</a><br>
<i>&gt; centuries.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1313qlink8">Mind you, archaeologists will frequently come up with explanations which
defy
<br>
rational analysis should you actually try to attempt what they are
saying, as
</a>
<br>
they have a professional abhorrence of the "we have no idea" response.
