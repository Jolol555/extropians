<a name="4497qlink1">No, you are incorrect.  If was responding in a "programmed" fashion, then I
would have been offended by Rob's post about women. My defense was not for
women, but for a generalization of males. I disagree with Rob's
generalization of male behavior for many reasons.  One of which is the fact
that not all men think all women are grouped together as a whole.  My
request for an apology was for my father, husband, my business associates,
and my many male friends.</a>

*George Carlin is so refreshingly rich in his portraiture of life, that I
tumble in laughter at his role playing jokes.  I haven't met him, but I did
catch a documentary with him talking to a least one or two females and I
think they had what one would call a conversation with content.
