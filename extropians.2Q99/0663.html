<a href="0652.html#0663qlink1">&gt;If there were predatory submarines, then there would indeed be</a><br>
<i>&gt;submarine-eating denizens of the deep, i.e. other submarines.  They would</i><br>
<i>&gt;eat each other.  They would also be subject to attack by smaller a-life</i><br>
<i>&gt;creatures.  Microscopic a-life creatures ("goo") would be more interested</i><br>
<i>&gt;in attacking submarines than in attacking us. In other words, the submarine</i><br>
<i>&gt;population would be kept in check just like the population of any other</i><br>
<i>&gt;organism is kept in check.  </i><br>

<p>
Forgive me if I'm not quite as knowledgable on this subject, but are you
saying that everything that is predatory has a predator, even if it is
members of its own kind?  I can think of several examples of species that
have no natural predators: sharks, tigers, and man being on the list.  And
in these species, inter-species predation is statistically rare.
Furthermore, it was my impression that the creatures composing the "goo"
were after carbon compounds in order to replicate...why would they prefer a
metal submarine to carbon-filled life forms like you and I?

<p>
Your comment about corporations as a-life is interesting, but I fail to see
why it has any effect on the matter at hand.  Yes, it is a problem that
merits attention.  It of course does not, however, lessen the potential
seriousness of the problem being discussed.
