I agree that it doesn't by itself solve all the problems of 
self-selection. My point was that it is by no means obvious that the 
right solution is to declare all universes with infinitely many 
observers logically impossible.

<p>
You might want to check out "Learning the impossible" by Vann McGee, 
chapter 10 in Probability and Conditionals, eds. Eells and Skyrms, 
1994. For a concise not-too-mathematical overview of non-standard 
analysis, I would recommend Appendix 4 in Brian Skyrms' Causal 
Necessity, 1980. (I haven't read that appendix yet, but Skyrms is 
good. I am currently working on a theory of chance, i.e. objective 
probability, that draws a lot of inspiration from chapter 1 of that 
book, as well as from David Lewis' theory.)

<a href="0312.html#0325qlink2">&gt; If nonstandard analysis works, there is no justification, otherwise I</a><br>

<a name="0356qlink1">Couldn't we just say that the rational probabilities in such a case 
are indeterminate? No preferred position, nor the assumption that all 
positions should have the same probability (if there are infinitely 
many observers).</a>

<p>
<a href="0312.html#0325qlink3">&gt; &gt; Because there is no center of gravity if the universe is spatially </a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; infinite (and roughly homogeneous).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ok, I see. What I said earlier only makes sense for a universe that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; spatially infinite but has finite mass. Although for a homogeneous</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe a preferred position may not be needed for SIA-1 since averages</i><br>
<i>&gt; do converge in such a universe, and we can define the measure of</i><br>
<i>&gt; observer-instants as the average density of observers weighted only in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; time dimension. (A preferred time is still needed because the universe is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not homogeneous in the time dimension.) </i><br>

<p>
I am still worried about the justificatio of this. I don't see why it 
should matter how much space there is between observers.

<p>
<a href="0312.html#0325qlink4">&gt; So let me clarify my current position. I think a nonstandard analysis</a><br>
<i>&gt; approach is promising, but it can't work by itself unless the universe is</i><br>
<i>&gt; homogeneous in all dimensions. If the universe is not homogeneous, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; need a preferred point.</i><br>

<p>
Or we could say that the probabilities are indeterminate; that is the 
solution that I am leaning towards at the moment.
