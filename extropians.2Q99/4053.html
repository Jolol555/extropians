<a name="4057qlink2">That's certainly interesting, but last I checked, nobody was even
remotely close to building a microprocessor out of DNA and/or
proteins. 
<br>
Provided one had some sort of marginally functional design for a
RISC made of protein, it would of course be possible to put it
through some heavy evolution to improve the design.  This would
however turn system architecture from an engineering discipline into
a science- once evolving a processor that can run a benchmark
program very well, the researchers would have to figure out what
this beast *was*... and given algernon's law, the evolved protein
processor would do the benchmark well, but anything else
suboptimally!

<p>
In the absence of a quick-turn hardware capability, my point stands:
a singularity driven by an expanding AI seed would be bottlenecked
by hardware.</a>
