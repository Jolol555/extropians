<p>
Depends on the wormhole physics. Given my understanding of it, the
device will not work. To keep a wormhole stable you need a "bracing"
field of some kind (negative energy is most commonly suggested,
although other weird physical processes might work).<a name="0901qlink1"> If you move mass
through the wormhole, the mass will interact with the bracing field
and this will change it. At least in the negative energy case you
would get that the field got weaker as you passed mass through it, and
if it ever got to zero, the wormhole will close.</a> My guess is that if
you calculate the energy gains and losses in the above scenario you
will see<a name="0901qlink2"> that it will not produce perpetual</a> motion, at most an amount
of energy equal to the amount of energy put into the wormhole.

<p>
Still, general relativity relaxes energy conservation somewhat, energy
is not well defined globally and in sufficiently odd spacetimes you
can get energy for free. And even in less odd spacetimes you can
likely extract energy from the spacetime (as in anisotropic collapsing
universes, where you can exploit the shear forces).
