Which is why you are talking some serious BS here. There is no way you could accelerate particles to high enough energies in the distance of a nanotech scale to cause the fusion reactions necessary to transmute elements. You might be able to do it with a mass of nanites working together as a particle accelerator, on hydrogen, but hydrogen (specifically the deuterium isotope) is the easiest atom to create a fusion reaction with, and we still have trouble with it. Each successive increase in atomic weight (hydrogen to helium, to lithium, to berellium, etc) requires increasing multiples of energy to cause them to fuse (with increasingly lower amounts of energy out of the reaction). Once you are at the level of iron, its easier to use fission to break larger elements apart than to fuse smaller ones together.

<i>&gt; diamondoid structural building materials.</i><br>

<p>
No it is not. Silicon has enough fewer valence bonds that it always loses the molecular competition to carbon.
