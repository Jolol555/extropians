This is probably going to sound like a dirty question, but would the government
have enough money to function based only on a sales tax? I'm no fan of government
expansion, but there ARE certain essential services that governments currently
provide.

<p>
Of course, one likely response is that the government can and should function on
dramatically less money, providing correspondingly less "essential" services.

transition period.

<p>
It's not just a matter of deciding what the ideal system would be. We also need a
plan for the orderly transition/decentralization of power. Given the current
American system of government, how WOULD you gradually eliminate/down
size/decentralize the government without massive drops in service levels, or
massive unemployment. (Sad fact: when a given agency employs a significant
portion of the population, their elimination makes a significant change to the
unemployment figures).</a>

<a name="3142qlink3">Big government can be likened to a drug addiction. Going off it cold turkey can
have dramatic negative health effects for the system as a whole, as bad or worse
as the effects of remaining addicted. Given that simply firing all government
officials one day would cause a brief period of anarchy followed by some form of
dictatorship almost certainly worse then the current system, how do we escape</a> it?
