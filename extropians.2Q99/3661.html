First, that position is as much as a belief as believing _ultimately_ there
are no limits  -- eventually.  Secondly, science is about *dis*proof  not
proof.  Thirdly, there are no such things as *impossibilities* in science.
The only way you can prove that something is impossible, is to run an infinite
number of experiments under an infinite set of conditions.  Since no one is
capable of doing this, wormholes can not be proven to be impossible any more
than anything else can be proven to be impossible.

<p>
My belief that everything is possible, in an _operational_ belief.  Sure I
can't go faster than light _now_, but my belief not to accept that, has
allowed me to learn and seek out any imaginable loophole that might allow us
to break the light speed barrier.  If we accepted the *apparent* limits around
us, we as a species would have never left the caves!!
