66 cloned cows processed for beef in Japan

<p>
TOKYO, April 23 (Kyodo) -- A total of 66 cloned cows have been 
processed for beef, and the milk from four others have been sold at 
markets, according to a survey by the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries released Friday. 

<p>
The animals were among 461 cows that were cloned from 1990 until 
March this year by technique in which the nuclei of fertilized eggs 
are transplanted into unfertilized eggs. 

<p>
Of the total number of cows, 144 were shipped to markets, according 
to the survey that examined 57 livestock research stations 
nationwide. 

<p>
Of the 144, 19 animals were raised at government research institutes, 
64 at prefectural research institutes and 61 at private enterprises, 
according to the survey. 

<p>
The ministry does not release the names of the companies to avoid 
damaging their reputations, although cloned cows are not believed to 
pose any safety problems. 

<p>
They are raised at experimental stations across Japan to improve the 
productivity of the livestock industry. 

<p>
The ministry maintains that because cows produced by the technology 
are biologically identical to those born naturally, restrictions on 
their shipment are not necessary. 

<p>
The survey also found that 57 cows cloned from an adult cell, or the 
same cloning technique as used for "Dolly" the sheep, were produced 
in Japan by the end of March. 

<p>
None of those cows, however, have been shipped, the ministry said.
