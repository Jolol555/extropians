<i>&gt; consumers had a lower mortality. Other studies have found little relation</i><br>

<i>&gt; polyunsaturated lowered it. Some studies have found omega-3 polys to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; particularly beneficial. Salad eaters enjoyed a lower mortality rate in</i><br>
<i>&gt; one study, which was found to be dependant on the amount of omega-3</i><br>
<i>&gt; containing salad dressing consumed, and not as one would think the amount</i><br>
<i>&gt; of vegetables ingested.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Whether dieting is healthy would seem to be entirely dependant on how it</i><br>

<p>
On a sort of related note:
<br>
I'm in a nutritional study about beef fat and cholesterol.  The two
variables they manipulate are consumption of saturated fats and
consumption of poly-unsaturated fats.  
<br>
The nutritionist doing the study was talking to a bunch of us
subjects about a previous study done in the same format using palm
oil instead of beef fat.
<br>
Aparently, they found that saturated fat (specifically palm oil) did
not raise cholesterol levels when equal portions of polyunsaturated
fat were consumed.
<br>
If high cholesterol levels increase mortality (which may be false),
then the right combination of fats can increase mortality just as well
as consuming only unsaturated fats.
