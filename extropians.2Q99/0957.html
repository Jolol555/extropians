Sounds interesting.

<p>

<p>
It might turn out that the way we develop semantic memories,
i.e. abstract information, is the gradual melding together of our
memories. That means we tend to loose their clarity, but we gain in
generalization ability.


<p>
This is something that interests me with memory enhancement. Is it
possible to both have the cake and eat it? If the multiple memory
trace model of Moscovitch and Nadal is true, then it might be possible
to tweak the consolidation processes to retain clear memories and get
abstraction. But this model is rather controversial (cf. the latest
issue of Current Opinion in Neurobiology).

<a name="0985qlink1">Questions for Anders and anyone else who feels qualified:

<p>
(1) What do you believe the feasible limits of memory enhancement will</a> be
ultimately?

<p>
<a name="0985qlink2">(2) Would uploading likely remove all the blocked pathways and enable
complete access?</a>

<p>
<a name="0985qlink3">(3) How useful would these recovered memories be if their clarity was
compromised due to the constructive and confabulatory nature of memory?
