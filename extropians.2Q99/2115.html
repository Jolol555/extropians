<a href="2106.html#2115qlink1">&gt;I read a lot of popular science books when I was a kid, and then</a><br>
<i>&gt;moved on the science fiction. It was at least a partial cause for</i><br>
<i>&gt;me becoming a transhumanist, but the reason I started with science</i><br>
<i>&gt;is at present unclear to me. But once I was immersed in the world</i><br>
<i>&gt;of science/science fiction, transhumanism slowly emerged as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;logical conclusion to me.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2106.html#2115qlink2">&gt;I wonder if children shouldn't be introduced to Stanislaw Lem's</a><br>
<i>&gt;_The Cyberiad_ at an early age. Many of the stories can likely be</i><br>
<i>&gt;translated into a simpler language (even if they often are</i><br>
<i>&gt;readable as they are in the translations I read), and put</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanistish ideas into the heads of children. Beside the</i><br>
<i>&gt;humor and nonsense, he deals with how to solve problems with</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence (such as the hillarious story about making the</i><br>
<i>&gt;perfect monster), the philosophical consequences of robots,</i><br>
<i>&gt;uploading, copying and a lot of other stuff, trains recursive &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;thinking and overall plays with your mind. </i><br>
 
<p>
I was a Tom Swift addict, and also another series with a character
called "Brains Benton". There was another series featuring a father
and his two sons, (one son named Randy) that covered things like
rocketry and the basics of atomic energy, very cool!

<p>
Let's not forget Johnny Quest.....

<p>
<a href="2106.html#2115qlink3">&gt;We need more transhumanists to write childrens books! And</a><br>
<i>&gt;cartoons! </i><br>


<p>
Agreed, but lets remember Socrates....
