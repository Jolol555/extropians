<a href="2474.html#2481qlink1">&gt; &gt; &gt; If someone is DANGEROUSLY IRRESPONSIBLE, why are they walking around</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; unsupervised?  Shouldn't they be in some kind of institution?  Or at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the very least, have a baby sitter?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A good question with no easy answer; it is nevertheless true that</i><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt; &gt; many such people are not only walking around, but doing so legally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; armed;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, and they are driving while drunk, driving while stupid, spreading</i><br>
<i>&gt; aids, beating people up, and conceiving children they aren't even</i><br>
<i>&gt; interested in taking care of.  And you seem to think that if only we made</i><br>
<i>&gt; sure that they didn't have a gun (how?) that we would somehow all be much</i><br>
<i>&gt; safer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
We would be safer, and safer still if everyone had to blow through a 
breatylyzer tube to start their car, had to be incarcerated for life for 
knowingly spreading aids, and have any wages and inheritances 
garnished to pay for their wild-oat progeny.  But I'm not arguing in 
favor of those things, although they may or may not be ideas worth 
considering.  I AM, however, making the point that just because 
there are other risks in the world is no reason to not act to 
reasonably minimize the one under discussion.  Arguing against A 
by pointing to Y has been a logical fallacy since Aristotle, and I 
doubt if you are going to resuscitate the validity of such an error at 
this late date.
