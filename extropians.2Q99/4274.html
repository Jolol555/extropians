<p>
Actually, I was exposed over 20 years ago and I am not male.  

<p>
Interestingly enough, I was injected by more females than males!  This is
why I cannot go along with your stats, however sincere you are about it.
Agreeably, the scientific aspect of transhumanism has much strength from
male discoveries and ingenuity, and probably in the technological aspect of
it, nor the psychological, philosophical or the aesthetics and arts of
transhumanity.  In fact, I would have to disagree with you fervently.

<p>
I think Ander's post was refreshing and delightful but I didn't comment to
Michael Lorrey because what I wrote was:"she [Rand] is not representational
of all transhuman female-memes . . ."  As far as I know she is a woman who
I have great admiration for, but I have not inspected her pants.

<p>
I thought Cynthia's post was endearing " I piped up and said well what
about me?"

<p>
I've said my peace, and I'll get back to my writing and get out of your
hair, James.
