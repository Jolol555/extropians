<a name="1368qlink1">Just thought I'd drop in on this to say that I find this "no need for
copyrights" school of thought to be intriguing, however, it does seem
sort of impractical, somehow.</a> For instance, in a free-copy future,
people would presumably have marketable skills of some sort, there'd
still be an economy.<a name="1368qlink3"> At the same time, it's hard to imagine that the
personal service of signing a book, say, could ever be worth nearly as
much as the book itself,</a> under a copyright system, or that an author
could earn much through putting advertising into his novels, either, if
anyone could freely run any book through an ad filter and then
redistribute it. If the production of a passive artifact, like a book,
is to hold value, and if we want the production of such things to be of
high quality, then wouldn't it be self-defeating to dilute the quality
in favor of forcing the creators out to do something more "active"?

<p>
Is it possible that the need for copyrights is being obscured by some of
the language that surrounds the whole idea of "intellectual property"?
For instance, I once read an article many years ago, where the author
was a computer game programmer who complained about how many dollars
every unauthorized copy was "stealing" from him. This struck me as sort
of like being ready to prosecute someone for grand theft auto, because
you saw the bounder taking a photograph of your car!<a name="1368qlink2"> Strictly speaking,
stealing something whose copies are inherently unlimited is a nonsense
proposition -- and maybe we've recognized that, now, in the popularity
of shareware, where copying is not in itself held to be a crime?</a> What
that editorial writer would have thought of the World Wide Web and the
proliferation of shareware is hard to say -- oops, there's another copy
of our product being downloaded, another X dollars lost!

<p>
Despite being logical nonsense on the surface, "intellectual property"
appeals to our sense of boundaries, so maybe it's as good a legal
fiction as any for defending copyrights?<a name="1368qlink4"> As long as it's clear that the
only real intent of copyrights is to discourage people from making a
*business opportunity* out of unauthorized</a> copies, I'd have to think of
this as an way to give creators some value for their efforts, through
having some control over their creations. The need for some sort of
business leverage or control seems to be the issue here, not that
different from battles over trademarks, or standing up for proper
attribution of quoted passages, etc?
