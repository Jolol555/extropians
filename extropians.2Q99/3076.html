I think you are right, because all those topics come from the Extropian
Principals.  But I think you have just given me an idea!

<p>
It may be too broad a spectrum to include Transhumanism, Self-Ownership, and
Spontaneous Order into the same list.  This translates into cryonicists and
cyberpunks talking with gun-owners and libertarians talking with anarchists
and tax evaders.  This is a diverse mix.  Even I got confused as to what was
on-topic, hence my question.

<p>
Maybe we could divide Extropians into a list for each of the major
principals?

<p>
    perpetualprogress@extropians.com
<br>
    selftransformation@extropians.com
<br>
    practicaloptimism@extropians.com
<br>
    intelligenttechnology@extropians.com
    opensociety@extropians.com
<br>
    selfdirection@extropians.com
<br>
    rationalthinking@extropians.com

<p>
and we could keep the general extropians@extropy.com for other discussions,
discussions about the extropian movement itself, or discussions about
extropians themselves.  Also, general announcements or references can be
sent to the main list as well.  Each person could subscribe to the main list
and whichever specific topic list they desired.

<p>
Would this work to subdivide topics?  Would this work for the gun debate, if
it primarily was held in selfdirection?  This might help keep some threads
on topic.  It might help keep on-topic threads like guns away from people
who want to talk about a different on-topic subject.

<p>
I think it would be useful.  It might help encourage discussions in all
extropian areas, and not just a few.  If there are topics that are of
interest to everybody, but don't fit into a category, it might help lead to
expansion of the Extropian Principals.  If there is a topic that doesn't get
much traffic, it could indicate a need for more information in that area.

<p>
Any comments?
