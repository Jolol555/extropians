One song that impressed me in my early youth was "The Final Countdown"
by Europe. I remembering spending a summer working on a design for an
interstellar multigeneration solar sail craft listening to it on the
radio.

<p>
But as for transhumanist lyrics, I would recommend Vacuum. "Symphonic
synth pop" with themes about science, religion and
individualism. Perhaps hard to get in the states, but quite fun:

Other fun transhumanist songs are Nuclear India (a celebration of the
Indian nuclear program: "When we control the fire // control the great
<pre>
divide // design // extropica // the pride of nuclear India"), Science
of the Sacred ("Adam and Eve // must have been mistaken // science has
awakened // all living things // Our pleasuredome // science of the
sacred // covering the naked // like a renaissance. // One scalar
field // answers are demanded // laws have been abandoned") and many
</pre>
songs about space exploration.

<a name="4680qlink1"><a href="4326.html#4362qlink2">&gt; I must give note here that I have already downloaded Max M's MP3 files.</a><br>
<i>&gt; This is probably the most blatantly Extropian musicology of which I'm aware.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The tunes have grown on me quite a bit (even though I had to download the</i><br>

<p>
I certainly agree!
