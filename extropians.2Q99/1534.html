And what do you do when you don't have enough resources (e.g. I want to 
a Jupiter-sized brain to run universe simulations, and I want it *now*),

<p>
And also said (you guessed it, out of context)
Machine, I want a Jupiter-sized brain. No, I don't care if you have to
dismantle all my neighbors and the rest of the planet to build it, just
get on and do it. You are there to provide for all my material needs,
and
<br>
I expect you to do it.

<a name="1629qlink1"><a name="1572qlink1"><a name="1568qlink1">I'm a bit worried about all this talk of Jupiter sized brains (although
I'm guilty of it myself).</a> 

<p>
<a name="1629qlink2"><a name="1570qlink1">Wouldn't such a thing be a target? If someone was annoying you who was
dependent on a Jupiter sized brain, then wouldn't you be tempted to lob
a couple of fusion bombs at it (sorry all you pacifists out there).</a></a></a></a> 

<p>
<a name="1629qlink3"><a name="1572qlink2"><a name="1568qlink2">Also, in my experience, computers have been getting *smaller* as time
wends its way towards whatever it wends its way towards. While we're all
doing this "my brain's bigger than yours" stuff, transhumans might be
more impressed by tiny, weeny little brains. "I've got the new
google-flops processor(s) running my brain, it's made out of quarks, and
is the size of the head of a match - oh wait, I've dropped it, hey,
guys, can you help me find my brain, it's here somewhere, no, don't step
there, aaarrgghhhh *gurgle*).</a></a></a>

<p>
<a name="1568qlink3">Anyway, surely it would play hell with your neck muscles.</a>

ps: Some things just can't be fixed by good posture.
