<i>&gt; &gt; If you exclude crimes which are lesser or are not offenses in other countries we'd</i><br>

<i>&gt; populations....</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; On the other hand, since most crime here is commited by criminals on other</i><br>
<i>&gt; criminals, I can't say that you could call all of our prisoners 'oppressed'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I agree with you here.

<a name="1882qlink1">Well, we tried going the route that european prisons are: pretty much forced vocational education and psych treatment. Problem was, the recidivism stats showed that it was a failure here. Here, the stats seem to bear out that if you make prison life as unbearable as possible, a crook is far less likely to want to go back to such an institution, so they took out the weight lifting equipment (reduces guard costs, esp. medical bills) they are taking out the college courses, etc. except at the minimum security resorts.
