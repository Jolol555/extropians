Top loaded speed 3mph, AFAIR. I think NASA keep it down to 1mph most of
the time just because it's a little safer and they're in no rush to get 
anywhere.

Actually it has to climb quite a steep ramp at the launch pad. Or do you
mean flat as in lack of lumps and bumps rather than gradient? It certainly
wouldn't like to roll over any rocks along the way, but the main problem
is that the shuttle would topple over, not that it couldn't do so; if it
was carrying something with a much lower center of gravity it could
probably take it over quite rough ground with those huge tracks and all
that power.
