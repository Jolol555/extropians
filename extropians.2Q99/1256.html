<p>
Every author needs an audience.  Freely sharing an author's works
enlarges the author's audience.  Because people understand and generally
practice the principle of value for value, if they find the author's
works to be of value, they are likely to compensate the author for their
perceived value of the work, and because they can freely share the
author's work, they are likely to share it with those who will also
compensate the author and continue spreading the work.
