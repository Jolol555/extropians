That makes sense.  Too many prima donnas in the scientific establishment;
they would rather try unsucsessfully to blaze their own paths to glory then
<a name="0171qlink5">to latch on to another scientist's programme.

<p>
This also explains why the Japanese have focused so much</a> more effectively on
<a name="0171qlink6">nanotech then us.  Their willingness to line up behind</a> a visionary leader,
<a name="0171qlink7">even a foreign luminary, has paid dividends for them</a> in the past (remember
Demming?).  I'll put my long term money with Nippon Nano.
