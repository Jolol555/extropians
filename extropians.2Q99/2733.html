<a href="2727.html#2733qlink1">&gt; In a message dated 6/3/99 7:50:44 PM, you wrote:</a><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This is SUCH complete bullshit. The Scots weren't locked up in chains</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and carted off to the other side of the planet. To even attempt to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;compare what happened to the scots to what happened to negroes is so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;obviously fatuous as to render me, um, speechless.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Listen, I just have to step in here. The word "negroes" is also often </i><br>
<i>&gt; considered offensive, so be careful - you might want to practise what you </i><br>
<i>&gt; preach. And I also think that a serious gaff was made, using the term "abo" </i><br>
<i>&gt; and racism abounds here (as it does in most so-called polite societies). I </i><br>
<i>&gt; believe it was inadvertant, which does not excuse it, BTW. You called </i><br>
<i>&gt; bullshit on it, and he replied, stating his own ethnicity. I have called </i><br>
<i>&gt; bullshit on so much racism and sexism on this list I can't even remember it </i><br>
<i>&gt; all. I've even gone  far as to yell "redneck" at people on this list. White </i><br>
<i>&gt; is as white does, etc. </i><br>
<i>&gt; However. The Scots history is far more closely comparable with the Native </i><br>
<i>&gt; Amercian than the African American. They had chiefs, they had clans, they had </i><br>
<i>&gt; tribes, all of which the British tried to stamp out. They were forbidden to </i><br>
<i>&gt; dress in their own way and forbidden to speak their own tongue. They were </i><br>
<i>&gt; dealt with very much like the First Nations here in the US.  Sure they are </i><br>
<i>&gt; white, and that somehow makes it seem less aggregious to many, for what </i><br>
<i>&gt; follows is a more efficacious "integration" into European society. If you are </i><br>
<i>&gt; brown you can't be as easily "assimilated". </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh.... and yes, Scots were locked in chains and carried off - to America. It </i><br>
<i>&gt; was called the great deportation. It is a sad story. It is why so many white, </i><br>
<i>&gt; as well as Native American people have Scottish ancestors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
