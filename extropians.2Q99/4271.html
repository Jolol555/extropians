<p>
Not at all.  It seems obvious to me that the robot functions independently
and can trigger its bits and store memory without the engineers.  It is
obviously conscious to some degree.  The disembodied neurons in your
previous example cannot trigger its bits and store memory without the
engineers.  It is obviously an inanimate object.

<p>
It does indeed come from the biochemical activity of the meat machine.
However, you have dismantled the meat machine in your previous example.
Even though all its parts are still available, they are no longer
functioning together as a system.  Machines stop functioning when they are
dismantled.  This disembodied "brain" cannot answer questions or hold
secrets separate from the engineers.  Any thought or function you ascribe to
it must first be performed by the engineers and then "credited" to the
disembodied brain.
