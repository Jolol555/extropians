<p>
This is an idea that I had while reading the latest issue of WIRED
(July).

<p>
I was reading an article on telematics, the in car data offerings
like G.M's "OnStar". This has been hugely popular and it seems G.M.
has a commanding lead.

<p>
The part where I had the idea is this.

<p>
Thge thing that made OnStar viable was the idea to use the national
cellular networks for the comunication's/data. The problem has been
the coverage area.

<p>
In the same issue I was reading how the global satelite covering
Iridium project is having problems getting subscribers.

<p>
In fact in the last few days as I've been considering this, Iridium
has lowered it's prices and the stock went up 15% yesterday.

<p>
Iridium is in serious trouble, and it's creditors have extended it
to the end of the month.

<p>
I'm not talking about G.M just using Iridium, I'm talking about G.M
buying a large portion or all of Iridium.

<p>
This would give G.M a worldwide base for it's ONSTAR equipped
products, plus the ability to beat the other competing systems, and
forge alliances with other global car/truck companies.
