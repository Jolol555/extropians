I think though that if technology obsoletes guns, then their proponents and
users will merely be looked on as quaint historical preservationists, much as
users of muzzle loading weapons and civil/revolutionary war re-enactors are
looked on today. Who, for gods sakes, considers archers to be a deadly threat to
society, even though one can kill just as easily with a compound bow, and far
more silently, as with a gun?<a name="2613qlink1"> There are about as many archers as there are gun
owners in the US.</a> I think that if I were the type to want or need to do someone
in, I would prefer using bow and arrow. Its as silent as a silencer, but you
don't need a permit to use it, and there are no federal regs requiring
background checks to purchase them. You can easily coat a hunting arrow with any
poison you like just to ensure that you acheive your goal.<a name="2675qlink1"> That more people are
