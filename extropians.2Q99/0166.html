<i>&gt; the act, why didn't he?  I certainly don't think suicide should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a crime, even when assisted, but if a patient /can/ perform the</i><br>
<i>&gt; final act himself but /will/ not, then I think his verbal consent</i><br>
<i>&gt; is of dubious value, and it is appropriate for a jury to look into</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions such as whether the family pressured the doctor into</i><br>
<i>&gt; performing the procedure, or whether the doctor's own agenda was</i><br>
<i>&gt; better served than the patient.</i><br>

<a name="0175qlink1">It is a question of delegation. If we are to apply your logic to other areas
of rights, then only people who have served in the military to defend the
nation have a right to enjoy the rights protected by that government. I have
a right to defend myself in court. The fact that I delegate the power to
execute that defense to an attorney does not negate my right to a defense,
but under your logic it would. The patient of Kevorkian has been documented
as being of sound enough mind to delegate his wishes to another who was more
capable of executing them than he.</a>
