FutureCulture list last year.

<p>
&gt;  Don't know what noided means.  <br>

<p>
as in para

<p>
&gt; I wrote my first<br>
<a href="2411.html#2522qlink2">&gt; proposal in 1991.  It wasn't complete.  Maybe you wrote yours earlier.</a><br>

<p>
Nope, 93.

<p>
<a href="2411.html#2522qlink3">&gt; Or I thought you wrote it later.  Whatever.  After last time whoever mentioned</a><br>

<p>
Hey, yay, this is pretty much my attitude and why I wasn't overly
bothered by your comment, I just thought "woh, one of those highly
possessive people" so backed right off. I wasn't interested in playing
ownership games, I was interested in seeing what you had done to see how
similar it was to mine and if there were any ideas we could swap, etc.


<p>
<a href="2411.html#2522qlink4">&gt; It's frustrating to the extreme to attempt any useful work on this stupid</a><br>

<p>
Absolutely, but you have no choice so get over it.

<p>
<a href="2411.html#2522qlink5">&gt; I promise i will dig in priorities and accusations of accusations if</a><br>

<p>
Yeah, sure. I hate power games, so if there aren't going to be any power
games I'd love to get involved.
