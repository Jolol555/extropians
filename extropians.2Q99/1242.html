For an adult cell to be cloned, it must somehow be made "young" again.
How the clock of life was turned back

<p>
By Andy Coghlan and David Concar

<p>
Dolly's birth shows that the biological development of cells is not as 
irreversible as scientists once thought. To make her, Ian Wilmut and his 
colleagues had to wind back the developmental clock of an adult udder cell. 
Thanks to their manipulations, the cell obliged. Its nucleus shook off its 
"udder cell" identity and was biochemically reprogrammed to begin life all 
over again.
<br>
Such reincarnation at the genetic level goes against long-held beliefs about 
molecular biology.
<br>
As an organism grows, its cells divide and specialise by switching on 
certain genes inside their nuclei and shutting others down. It is a complex 
business involving specialised proteins that manipulate DNA and enzymes that 
chemically modify the strands with methyl groups. People assumed that genes 
were shut down for good, but Dolly's arrival appears to show that the 
process is reversible.
<br>
In pioneering experiments with frogs in the 1970s, a team led by John Gurdon 
at the University of Cambridge transplanted nuclei from the skin cells of 
adult frogs into frog eggs lacking their own nuclei. While some embryos grew 
into tadpoles, none reached adulthood.
<br>
Wilmut says the key to success lies in the unique way his team manipulates 
the cells that donate the genetic material. They starve the donor cell into 
a state of hibernation by placing it in a salt solution containing just 
enough growth factor to keep it alive. The cell stops dividing and copying 
its DNA, and shuts down all but the most vital of its genes. This seems to 
enable the nucleus-free egg to reprogram the new nucleus.
During the first few hours of development, sheep embryos are slow to 
activate genes in their nuclei. This period of "genome silence" may also 
give the egg a breathing space to reprogram the new nucleus, says Jonathan 
Slack, an embryologist at the University of Bath.
But working out the biochemistry--and limits--of this reprogramming will 
keep researchers busy for years. The new findings suggest the egg must 
contain proteins and enzymes powerful enough to remodel and repackage a 
specialised nucleus. But nobody yet knows what these molecules are, or 
whether clones could be made with any adult cells.
"Brain and muscle cells are probably so [specialised] that you can't reset 
their clocks," says Wilmut.
<br>
Another big question is whether cells from a very old donor would work. Some 
molecular changes that build up during ageing--such as random damage to 
DNA--are likely to prove impossible for an egg to reverse.

Fasten your seatbelts . . .

<p>
The news that a Californian woman who died from leukaemia a year ago will 
become a mother 'from beyond the grave' will have worried many people 
concerned about the uses to which new medical technologies are put. Yet it 
should surprise few.
<br>
Julie Garber, who was 28 when she died, had some of her eggs removed and 
fertilised by an anonymous donor before undergoing cancer treatment. Her 
grandparents claim she wanted them to find a surrogate mother for her child 
after her death, and last week a 23-year-old woman obliged.
The ethical dilemmas are myriad, and the US has been troubled by them since 
Jean and Howard Garber began advertising for a surrogate for their 
'grandchild'. Many people are horrified that advances in reproductive 
biology can allow the birth of a child whose mother has been dead for well 
over a year.
<br>
They should be prepared for worse. For what this case amply demonstrates is 
that if a technology exists that meets a biological need, somebody, 
somewhere will use it, whatever the ethical opposition -- and probably 
whatever the cost. It happened with in vitro fertilisation, today widely 
accepted.
<br>
It's now happened with the late Julie Garber's embryo. It will happen with 
human cloning -- when the technology is good enough, and the price right. 
Making the impossible possible is bound to raise difficult questions.
The benefits of biological innovation will come hand in hand with a host of 
dubious applications, against which people will demand to be protected. They 
should realise, though, that no amount of legislation can put the genie back 
in the bottle.
