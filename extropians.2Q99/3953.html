<a href="3925.html#3953qlink1">&gt; Prisoners who rape are doing it for much more than sexual release - it's a</a><br>
<i>&gt; power trip.</a></i><br>

<p>
<a name="3996qlink1"><a name="3958qlink1">Apparently this "rape = power not sex" meme, though powerfully transmitted,
has very little empirical support (read "seems wrong every time it is
tested"). People use to power (rape) to have sex, not vice-versa.</a>

<p>
<a name="3996qlink2">While theoretically and perhaps even introspectively the power meme may
appear valid, an abundance of sexually available people appears to reduce
the frequency of rape. Ergo, the (admittedly monstrous and amoral) rapist
chooses sex and is happy to get it without the bother of having to rape
someone. This result seems incompatible with the "rape is not about sex"</a></a>
hypothesis.

<p>
It remains an open question. The recent British book on selected soldier's
diary reports of killing (during war) as being both sexually exciting and
rewarding has gotten lots of discussion going regarding the connection
between violence and sex, also.
