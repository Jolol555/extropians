I don't know if you could stay up 72 hours on it or not, but it seems
reasonable.

<p>
I take two 100mg tablets in the morning and it lasts through the day.
Taking additional tablets later simply extends the effect.  With
Ritalin, you do feel when it starts having effect, and you can feel
when it is wearing off (the Ritalin works typically 4 hours at a
time.)  With the Provigil you don't really feel it per se, you just
don't feel sleepy.  A colleague at work contacted our pharmacy while
on speakerphone to ask how it works - it apparently works on dopamine
receptor sites blocking reuptake, and on "alpha"(?) (I didn't make out
all of the second part, though :-(  It has yet to make the PDR, but is
documented on the pharmacy formulary info subscriptions.  Your local
pharmacist could get you more detailed info on the actions,
contraindications, possible side effects etc.

<p>
The listed potential side effects included euphoria, headaches,
irritability, difficulty sleeping (duh!).  It is quite expensive
though.  Without a health plan a months supply was about $250.  Unlike
Ritalin and the amphetamines it is not Schedule II, so those
limitations don't apply (schedule II require you to fill the
prescription within 72 hours, must be issued in duplicate, cannot
include refills, must reference the diagnosis, must include a street
address, can only be a 30 day supply.)

What happens if you take it more often than once in the morning..
is it really possible to stay usefully awake anywhere near 72
hrs?
