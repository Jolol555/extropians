<a name="1168qlink1">I don't "cling" to it or anything like a security blanket, I USE it.
It protect's my work in what ever terms you want to put it. I have no idea 
what your problem with what I said is I merely stated why I use it, for 
poetry (that I too have had published). As long as I'm writing, and the laws 
are set up as such I will continue to use them.</a>
Here's more clarifications for you,


<p>
U.S. Copyright Law

<p>
Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States 
(title 17, U.S. Code) to the authors of "original works of authorship" 
including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other 
intellectual works. This protection is available to both published and 
unpublished works. Section 106 of the Copyright Act generally gives the 
owner of copyright the exclusive right to do and to authorize others to do 
the following:


<UL>
  <li>  To reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;

  <li>  To prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;

  <li>  To distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the 
public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or 
lending;

  <li>  To perform the copyrighted work publicly, in the case of literary, 
musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures 
and other audiovisual works; and

  <li>  To display the copyrighted work publicly, in the case of literary, 
musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, 
graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion 
picture or other audiovisual work.


</UL>
<p>
It is illegal for anyone to violate any of the rights provided by the Act to 
the owner of copyright. These rights, however, are not unlimited in scope. 
Sections 107 through 119 of the Copyright Act establish limitations on these 
rights. In some cases, these limitations are specified exemptions from 
copyright liability. One major limitation is the doctrine of "fair use," 
which is given a statutory basis in section 107 of the Act. In other 
instances, the limitation takes the form of a "compulsory license" under 
which certain limited uses of copyrighted works are permitted upon payment 
of specified royalties and compliance with statutory conditions. For further 
information about the limitations of any of these rights, consult the 
Copyright Act or write to the U.S. Copyright Office....

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I write poetry, and I wouldn't put it in any type of public eyesight </i><br>
<i>&gt;without</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a copyright, this ensures the security of my work. No other party can </i><br>
<i>&gt;claim</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it to be theirs, at least not for 70 years or so. This is a measure that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; does hold up in court, if someone else tags their name to a work of </i><br>
<i>&gt;poetry I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; created, a copyright proves it. If this is "arguable because we don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; protect markets in other things", then get on it, don't try to demean </i><br>
<i>&gt;what's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; authors have, it's a needed tool. It is for my protection, not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; government.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No one can claim your work as theirs, ever, even without copyright--</i><br>
<i>&gt;that's simple fraud.  Why is it that those most in favor of copyright</i><br>
<i>&gt;seem to know so little about what it actually is?  Copyright is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;what prevents me from claiming I wrote your poem; it prevents me from</i><br>
<i>&gt;posting it on my site with the note "Here's a poem I like by Gina</i><br>
<i>&gt;Miller...".  It prevents me from publishing it a collection book, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;making an artistic variation of it.  Copyright has nothing to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt;protecting the "integrity" of your work or your credit--it's about</i><br>
<i>&gt;protecting your market from competition.  Whether or not that's a</i><br>
<i>&gt;good thing is still arguable, but let's call a spade a spade.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am an author and programmer; I earn my living writing things, most</i><br>
<i>&gt;of which are copyrighted by my employer.  I am thoroughly convinced</i><br>
<i>&gt;that in a world without copyrights I would earn twice as much money</i><br>
<i>&gt;as I do now and produce better work, because my storehouse of</i><br>
<i>&gt;information to draw upon would be freer, and the demand would increase</i><br>
<i>&gt;for creative work that was timely and original.  Artists who cling</i><br>
<i>&gt;to copyrights like a security blanket deserve my "demeaning", and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;make no apology for it.</i><br>
