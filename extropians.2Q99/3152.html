<a name="3155qlink1">Absolutely.   The last time I was really tremendously furious was, oooh,
probably 91 or 90.  It's just not worth getting so attached to something
that you get pissed off when it is thwarted/broken/negated etc.  And
yes, bad things have happened, people have been mean to me, I've been
fairly comprehensively betrayed by very close friends a couple of times
in the last 6 years, but I never became enraged or furious.  *I'm* in
charge, not my hormones.</a>
