I just bought this game last week and it has interesting
transhuman/extropian ideas in it.  I searched the archives and didn't
see a previous discussion of it, so I'm posting about it now.

<p>
Alpha Centauri (actually Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri) is pretty much the
sequal to that great old game "Civilization."  This is a turn based
strategy game where you control one of seven "factions" of colonists
who have landed on a new planet.  You build up your territory, discover
(research) new technologies and build armies to crush your foes.

<p>
Interestingly, a lot of the technologies you can discover are
nanotechnology based.  You can build Nanohospitals, Nanfactories,
etc...

<p>
The coolest or most transhuman aspect of the game is that you can win
the game by the discovery of a tech called "Ascent to Transcendence"
which is pretty much becoming Posthuman.  The game even mentions
transhumans and posthumans.  It's not a perfect representation of our
philosophy (it's a game afterall), but it's still refreshing to see
transhumanism presented in such a positive light (winning by becoming
Posthuman as opposed to winning by diplomacy or conquest - which are
also possible).

<p>
I reccommend the game to anyone who likes turn based strategy games.
