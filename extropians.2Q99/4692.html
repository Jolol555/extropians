I've heard rumors that on her first shuttle flight, Bob Crippen did
indeed "Ride Sally Ride".  The two of 'em had notorious googly eyes
for each other during training for the two flights they did
together.  There's been quite a few coed flights (most by now I
think), and I'm sure some of 'em have found a chance to rip one
off...

I just want zero gee sex to be available to us civilians :)
