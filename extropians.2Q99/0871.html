New Study Questions `Gay Gene'
<br>
 By LAURAN NEERGAARD= AP Medical Writer=

<p>
     WASHINGTON (AP) _ Canadian scientists are questioning whether a
 gene inherited from mothers influences men's sexual orientation in
 a study that attacks U.S. researchers' hunt for a ``gay gene.''
<p>
     Scientists still can't explain what determines a person's sexual
 orientation, although many studies have suggested that it is
 biology and not choice.
<p>
     The first such evidence came in 1991, when researchers
 discovered that identical twins of gay men were much more likely to
 also be gay than were fraternal twins.
<p>
     Then National Cancer Institute geneticist Dean Hamer made
 headlines in 1993 by suggesting that one such gene resides in a
 region of the X chromosome, one of the microscopic structures that
 carry genes. Men inherit that chromosome from their mothers.
<p>
     Although Hamer never identified the gene itself, his research
 suggested its location by finding that 33 of 40 pairs of gay
 brothers shared certain genetic ``markers'' that heterosexual brothers
didn't.
<p>
     But in a report to be published in Friday's journal Science,
 Canadian scientists said they tried to reproduce Hamer's study and
 found no link.     Neurologist George Rice of the University of Western
Ontario
<br>
 studied gay brothers from 48 families and said they were no more
 likely to share X-linked genetic patterns than would be determined by
chance.
<p>
     That doesn't mean genes don't influence homosexuality, Rice
 said, just that scientists should hunt elsewhere. ``We are still
 looking,'' he said.
<p>
     Hamer vehemently defended his research, saying other scientists
 have found evidence supporting it. ``This study doesn't disprove
 that,'' he said.
<p>
     Hamer said Rice may have diluted chances of finding an X-linked
 gene by studying families with homosexuality mostly on the father's
 side instead of the mother's.
<p>
     Rice said he didn't single out families _ and that excluding
 those that concerned Hamer wouldn't affect the results.
<p>
     Rice's report ``certainly does decrease the likelihood'' of an
 X-linked gene, but isn't proof, said J. Michael Bailey of
 Northwestern University, who did the first gay twin research. He
 called for a larger study to settle the debate.
<p>
     ``I would bet a million dollars that there are going to be
 biological factors involved in sexual orientation. I am certainly
 less sure that it's genes,'' he added, noting that hormones or
 other factors may be the answer.
