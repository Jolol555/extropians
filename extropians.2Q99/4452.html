<a href="4449.html#4452qlink1">&gt; Now that the "science can't explain the subjective" thing is out in the</a><br>
<i>&gt; open, I can't help but wonder if this isn't the logical end of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussion? If some folks are going to hold that science can't explain</i><br>
<i>&gt; the subjective, then maybe there's no point in coming up with elaborate</i><br>
<i>&gt; schemes to prove that? It seems that any scenario to prove the "failure"</i><br>
<i>&gt; of science on this, is itself going to be a kind of science or</i><br>
<i>&gt; engineering or materials scenario, maybe even involving "ghost energy"</i><br>
<i>&gt; of some sort? How can any materialist or realist scenario prove that</i><br>
<i>&gt; realism is missing an essential component?</i><br>

This is all fine, except that we are considering uploading ourselves /
neural enhancement / etc as a path to trans/posthumanity. So getting a good
idea of what subjective consciousness is, and of how its continuity is
achieved/behaves, is a pretty important pragmatic, practical consideration
for those of us considering this option. It's not just a bunch of
philosophical timewasting crap, it matters, and will directly impact us.
Ignoring the issue (materialism) may just mean a very personal, subjectively
real (although non-measurable) experience of death and extinguishment of
self in the near future. 

<p>
If my consciousness is extinguished inside a singularity, and there is no
one there to observe, does it piss me off? Yes!!!!

<p>
Not that any of this helps at all, of course.
