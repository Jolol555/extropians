Max, I am extremely grateful for your calm response.  I am indeed frustrated
at lack of progress.  I'm afraid all my observations came out as harsh
criticisms.  Rereading them, I find that they sounded much harsher than I
intended.  It was a reflection of my own frustrations, and not due to you or
ExI in any way.  I just finished working five 100-hours weeks in a row, and
my frustrations momentarily overwhelmed my civility.

<p>
<a name="4225qlink1">I'm afraid that quite a few things have frustrated me recently:  the
realization that many of the old-timers are off the list,</a> the realization
how long the list has been running, the apparent lack of progress when
remembering all our early plans, and the recent problems with list members'
inability to act civil to one another.

<p>
<a name="4225qlink2">I'm not sure what to do about it, but I get really frustrated at lack of
progress in many areas.  I get frustrated that many grand ideas never go
anywhere.  I get frustrated that collections of great minds end up bickering
rather than collaborating.  I get frustrated that forward-thinking groups
often seem indistinguishable from any other flame-fest on the net.  Even
with all our aspirations, we end up being only human after all.  I guess we
still have a lot of work to do.</a>
