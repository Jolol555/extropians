<i>&gt; &gt; I guess I'll weigh in also.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; All of the insinuations and outright name-calling seem non-productive, to say</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the least.  I think we can safely assume that we all share a desire to see the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; overall level of violence decrease, whether in the schools or in society at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; large.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I propose a test to determine whether rational debate is possible for this topic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; on this list, in the form of two questions.  (1) If there existed a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; preponderance of evidence showing that violence does in fact _decrease_ when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; guns are readily available, would the anti-gun forces actually change their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stripes?  (2) If there existed a preponderance of evidence showing that violence</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; does in fact _increase_ when guns are readily available, would the pro-gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; forces renounce their faith in the proliferation of the weapons?  If the answer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to either question is "no" (as I rather suspect it is) then rational debate is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; impossible and no one will allow themselves to become susceptible to whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; evidence or argument the "other side" may offer.  A counter-productive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; enterprise to say the least (though perhaps illuminating to any who do not feel</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; knowlegdeable enough to take a position).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is too simplistic. Readily available to who? Even if guns are outlawed here</i><br>
<i>&gt; today, the criminals will still have ready access to guns to their hearts desire,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are so many squirreled away. Given this, and since it has already been</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusively proven that crime does in fact go down when guns are readily available</i><br>
<i>&gt; and can be carried concealed by law abiding citizens, then I can say, ok. A telling</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact is that Prof. John Lott's original study was done under the employ of Handgun</i><br>
<i>&gt; Control Inc, until his results showed the opposite of what HCI wanted him to prove.</i><br>
<i>&gt; HCI took him to court to prevent him from attaching their name in any way to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; study, and despite the fact that his study covers the largest sample of crime data</i><br>
<i>&gt; in history (all FBI crime stats from 1979 to 1995), the gun crime researchers who</i><br>
<i>&gt; are invested in the gun control cause insist on calling his study 'flawed'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I will contribute that I have seen studies of these questions conducted by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Professor Lott of Chicago, and am unaware of any party discovering major flaws</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in his and his associates' work.  The studies strongly suggest that overall</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; levels of violence, death, and injury decrease when concealed-carry is legal.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They also show specifically that mass-shooting incidents such as at Columbine</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; also decrease markedly.  Finally, when analyzing the lawsuits pending against</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; gun manufacturers, they conclude that gun ownership saves society far more money</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and people (in terms of crimes, injuries, and deaths prevented) than they cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in terms of illegal shootings and suicides.  If anyone has missed the previous</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; references to this work on this list, I'm sure I can dig them up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I am curious to know if anyone can present evidence (not flaming rhetoric) that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; suggests the opposite conclusion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; They can't which is why they get into their hysterical spitting moods...</i><br>

<a name="2069qlink1">It cannot be argusd that removing guns selectively from those with 
the propensity to lawlessly and/or irresponsibly use them 
(convicted violent criminals, children, the mentally deficient or 
deranged, spouse and/or child abusers) would provide the 
<a name="2103qlink1">maximum in societal protection.  However, the pro-gunners are 
<a name="2103qlink2">addicted to punishment and immune to prevention.  They would 
</a>
rather have Harris and Klebold shoot up a school full of kids, and 
<a name="2103qlink3">then punish them, than to adopt reasonable and rational measures 
</a>
designed to prevent the guns from getting into their hands.
