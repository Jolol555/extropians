At a complete guess:  Something by W.T. Quick, like "Dreams of Flesh and
Sand", "Dreams of Gods and Men", "Systems" and "Singularities".

<p>
I bought the last one (it was just some indefinable something about the
title...), but it was an even bigger dud than "Mother of Storms".  (Any
decent Singularity shouldn't leave a planet when it's through.)  Anyway,
megacorp cyberpunk world, company founder uploads himself, not sure
about the "Fireball Industries" part.

<p>
Alternatively, there was something almost like that in _Hardwired_ by
Walter John Williams, but I don't think that's what you're thinking of.
