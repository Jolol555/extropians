This is a fine sentiment but more the exception than the rule.  People do
compromise. . . they do settle . . . less these days than in the past,
admittedly.  I'm just saying that older people perceive that they have fewer
options because they believe they won't be able to attract another partner
or they can't make it alone financially or they don't want to hurt the other
person, or what would the children think, or any other number of reasons.
IMO, future circumstances will eliminate many of these perceived and real
barriers and people will in general feel more independent and less disposed
to honoring vows that no longer hold any meaning for them.

I remember hearing an evolutionary psychologist suggest that spousal
relationships were designed to last about as long as it took for a child to
grow to the age of 7 or so (hence the "7 year itch").  Or maybe it was that
fact that by the time you were ready to mate, you only had another 7 years
on average before you died.  Anyway, she indicated that we certainly weren't
designed to be together for 50 and 60 years, let alone hundreds.  Some
couples will achieve this, I have no doubt, but I wouldn't be surprised to
find that the average does indeed drop to about 7 years or so.  Again, I
don't see this as a bad thing, necessarily.  Every relationship is unique
and individuals shouldn't be guided by the "averages".   Rather, they should
stay together as long the relationship is functional for both parties and
provides sufficient emotional fulfillment.

<a name="0780qlink1"><a name="0750qlink1"><a name="0739qlink1">But here's a question for you (at the risk of being kookified).  Men are
from Earth and women are from Earth but we clearly differ when it comes to
what we want out of a relationship and these differences are often at the
heart of our inability to maintain loving relationships.  Should we be
viewing these differences as a human limitation to be transcended?</a>   Should
<a name="0739qlink2">we try to redesign our psyches in order to enhance our mutual</a> capacities for
<a name="0739qlink3">successful marital relationships?  Shall we make men more like women,</a> women
<a name="0739qlink4"><a name="0710qlink1">more like men,</a> or try to identify the most adaptive and resilient attributes
</a>
<a name="0739qlink5">of both and head everyone in that direction.  Then there'd be two</a> sexes but
</a>
<a name="0739qlink6">only one gender.  Would that be a bad thing? Or is there even a place for
</a>
sex in our post-human future.  Other than the discussion on robots</a> as sexual
<a name="0739qlink7">partners and sex in cyberspace, I don't recall seeing any postings</a> on sexual
transhumanism.

<p>
Another thought came to me on this topic.  I'm paraphrasing here, but
Eliezer talked about how we would eventually come to understand subjective
experiences like the appreciation of art, music, joy, love, etc.  Is anyone
worried that when we dissect and fully reveal the nature of these subjective
experiences, we will probably lose the mystery and the meaning that those
experiences hold for us?  How can I appreciate Mozart, Mona Lisa, and Mary
Lou next door when I am completely aware of the causal mechanisms behind
those feelings?  In short,<a name="0780qlink2"> if I really understood the anatomy of love, would
</a>
I ever fall in love again?
