Mark complains,

<p>
<a href="1336.html#1344qlink1">"You know, you complain and complain about lack of respect, but how much</a><br>
respect exactly do you have for anyone who doesn't believe in your
fantasy? You keep telling us how bad and childish we are, and want to
force us to do what you want. How can you complain that other people
don't respect you when you don't have the slightest respect for us?"

<p>
<a name="1366qlink1">Why so much hostility, Mark?</a>  I simply made the observation that people's
<a name="1366qlink2">hostility towards each other is responsible for most of the world's
problems.  Why do you interpret this as though I am saying you are bad
<a name="1366qlink6">and childish?</a>  And why do you imagine that I have any desire to force you
to do what I want?</a>  I have not expressed these things.  Your hostility
has made you misunderstand what I am saying.  

<p>
<a name="1632qlink4">Because you are so full of hostility, you do not realize that we</a> actually
agree on pretty much everything.  Because of your hostility, you feel you
must have enemies to justify how you feel, so you see me and others as
opposed to you, even though we are not.  I understand your hostility very
well; I have felt that way many times, and I still often do.  I simply
<a name="1366qlink7">realize now that my hostility is responsible for most of my problems, and
I am working to move beyond</a> that.

<p>
Whatever lack of respect you perceive, I do not feel that I am being
disrespectful.  I remember how often my own hostility has made me
interpret others' neutral or even positive statements as being insulting
or threatening.  

<p>
I point out your own hostility, not to be rude or condescending, but
because I know how dangerous it is.  You are part of my world, and your
actions will have an influence on me.<a name="1366qlink8">  It is in my best interest to help
you escape the dangerous trap of your own hostility.</a>
