<a href="1317.html#1319qlink1">&gt; Most property that humans use is created by humans, and we can always</a><br>
<i>&gt; create more.  There is a finite amount of accessible natural resources on</i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth, but there is plenty to provide all humans with a very comfortable</i><br>
<i>&gt; living situation, with current technology.  Because humans generally view</i><br>
<i>&gt; most other humans as enemies, they refuse to cooperate with each other to</i><br>
<i>&gt; provide a comfortable situation for all involved.  This perpetual war</i><br>
<i>&gt; among most humans is the source of most human problems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="1325qlink1"><i>&gt; "Property rights" is a good solution when people have little respect for</i><br>
<i>&gt; each other and would routinely deprive each other of the basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessities for living.  But the concept of property rights does little</i><br>
<i>&gt; to heal the underlying hostility among humans.  If people were not so</i><br>
<i>&gt; hostile towards each other, there would be no need for "property rights".</a></i><br>

Believe me, I am not as blindly dismissive of your ideas as you might
imagine--but I still think you're so far from reality here that it's
in a different zip code.<a name="1325qlink2">  Your assumption that there exists "enough"
physical resources for all humans rests on the faulty notion that
there is such a thing as "enough", or such a thing as a "comfortable"
standard of living.  No such thing exists.  The human will is infinite,
and the resources to serve that will are finite.  I "hoard" resources
to my will not because I begrudge others their will, but simply
because I value my own, and the two inevitably conflict.  I genuinely
want every human on the planet to be wealthy beyond their dreams, and
every human /will/ be wealthy beyond the dreams of /today/'s humans
tomorrow.  But when that happens, the infinite desires of all humans
will ensure that some will want more, and more, and more.  That's a
good thing.  If our resources ever become "enough" to satisfy our
wills, then our wills are too limited.</a>
