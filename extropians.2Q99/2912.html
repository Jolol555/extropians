<a href="2886.html#2912qlink1">&gt;  very safe for a human passenger.  When two vehicles collide, the difference</a><br>

<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  As purely anecdotal evidence, I have been hit many times while in a variety</i><br>

<i>&gt;  driving a '79 Toyota Corolla (a dinky tin death trap).  Needless to say,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the impact was quite bone-jarring and it shoved the car pretty hard, but I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  walked away the worse for wear.  I have also been slammed by a similar</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Honda Accord while stationary in a Ford Bronco.  It totalled the Honda and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I was mildly annoyed when the Bronco shuddered under the impact, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;  otherwise barely noticed I'd been hit.  I've been hit a number of times by</i><br>
<i>&gt;  a lot of other vehicles (and once or twice, I did the hitting), but I chose</i><br>
<i>&gt;  these two because the circumstances were very similar but in wildly</i><br>
<i>&gt;  different vehicles.  I can say with great certainty that structural mass</i><br>
<i>&gt;  makes a big difference where vehicle-vehicle collisions are concerned.  For</i><br>
<i>&gt;  this reason alone, I drive heavy, steel-framed vehicles.  Considering the</i><br>

<i>&gt;  vehicles as an insurance policy.  (On the other hand, I am increasing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  odds that the other person involved in a collision with me will be mortally</i><br>
<i>&gt;  injured.) </i><br>

arms race of mass going on around me on the freeway.  Building light, 
high-performance (in many senses of the term) cars is more challenging than 
just welding on more steel, but there are certainly ways to make very light 
cars very safe: As just a couple of examples, crush zones and air bags are 
huge advances over the death traps of my youth. (I sat in a beautifully
