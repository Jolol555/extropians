I suspect in such a situation, marriages would have a half life of about 20 yrs.

Scott this is a *prime* example of a situation where you might want to
call in the friends and family for a last party, then take your chances with
the deep freeze.  I would rather try that route.  Unless I had en extra 100k
to blow, then I guess you could try both.

<p>
The point you raise is an important one if cryonics becomes common.  It
is too easy to imagine a situation where the family is gathered around
one's bedside saying: Grampa, you are old, you are sick, all your friends
are either dead or dying.  Take a cold bath, leave us your money, since
we all need it so badly, and wake up when life is better.

<p>
You might not really be ready for such a step, but the pressure might
still be there, even if not expressed.  Lawmakers might try to argue
this scenario to outlaw cryonics.   {8-[  spike
