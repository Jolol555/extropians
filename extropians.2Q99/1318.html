<p>
The problem is this strategy was used as far back as 1927 and was ruled
ineffective by the Supreme Court. _Sullivan_ (47 SCt 607).

<p>
Evidently, another individual responded to my post, let me repeat my
response here since you appear to be raising the same issues (I leave the
individual as anonymous since he responded via private email):

<p>
Anonymous stated:

<p>
"For illustration purposes, let's take section 7203,
"Willful failure to file". This sections states that it is a
misdemeanor towillfully fail to file a return that is required.
Well, there are hundreds of different returns. If you are required
to file an income tax return, this would not apply to a return
that is used for the filing of manufacturing taxes on the
manufacture of bus chassis'. There needs to be an underlying
requirement, which must be stated in the charge. Unfortunately,
when this charge is made, there is never an underlying statute
or return mentioned. How can one plea guilt or innocence to a
charge when the charge is not clear? The reason they do not is
that most of the time, they are trying to use it agaonst someone
who did not file a 1040. However, the law requires very few
citizens to file a 1040. That is why they never list the form
required in the charge (more on this later)."

<p>
The Supreme Court has addressed this issue already, 70 years ago
no less. In _Sullivan_ (47 SCt 607), the Court stated that
"[p]rivilege against  incrimination in Fifth Amendment is not a
defense to an indictment charging failure to file return, and does
not authorize a refusal to state the amount of income, though the
taxpayer,s income was made in crime." To apply the Fifth Amendment
in the manner you are describing was described by the Court as
"extravagant" and "extreme" (actually referring to a less extreme
application of only refraining from disclosing illegal activities).

<p>
Furthermore, Section 7203 has been successfully applied on many
occasions against "Fifth Amendment" protestors.  See _Vance_
(730 F.2d 736) and _Grabinski_ (727 F.2d 681).  Given the judicial
stance in the Appellate courts which is further buttressed by the
Supreme Court, I would like to see the counsel who would assert
your reasoning in a proceeding.

<p>
Additionally, your own personal version of 'constitutionality' will
not qualify for the good faith defense.  See _Payne_ (800 F.2d 227).

<p>
If a client came to me wanting to assert this defense I would tell him
I did not want to steal his money because there is no chance he would
prevail.  Why not assert that any payment is not made in cash but in
Federal Reserve Notes that are mere promises to pay and are not
redeemable in gold or silver? (though the courts have shot this down
too I believe).

"According to 26 USC 6331(a), levy may only be made on the accrued
salary or wages of an officer, employee or elected official of the
United States or District of Columbia. Furthermore, levy must be
made through seizure. Seizure, according to the CFR, may only be
made (for tax reasons) if the taxable activity in question is a
stamp tax (i.e., manufacture for retail re-sale of alcihil, tobacco,
or firearms)."

<p>
Perhaps you should flip back to Section 6321 and reconsider this
stance.

"Care to provide cites for these cases. This argument has won several
times as well. Again, they can assess a tax if: it is a stamp tax,
a return was filed, or they have consent form the "taxpayer". That is
what the law says - exactly!"

<p>
Check out the cites I've referred to above and citate them back as well.

<p>
One last thing, let me bolster my point of 'vicarious liability' with the
following excerpt from a respected treatise concerning tax protestors:

<p>
<i>&gt;The most commonly used civil sanctions against tax protestors are</i><br>
the damages of up to $25,000 that the Tax Court routinely imposes upon
taxpayers  whose petitions assert frivolous positions or are filed merely
for delay; the $500 administrative penalty the IRS exacts for filing a
frivolous tax  return; and the routine imposition by both district courts
and courts of appeals of costs, double costs, and the government,s
attorney,s fees on taxpayer litigants who raise frivolous arguments
against the tax laws.&lt;

<p>
In responding to this message, be mindful of the _Payne_ decision
when proselytizing a personal view of constitutionality and address the
Courts.  Address how your position has such force that a judge would
discard the words of every Appellate Circuit, the Supreme Court of the
United States, among other authorities.
