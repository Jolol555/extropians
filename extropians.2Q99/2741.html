A cold environment would help a little, but not much.  You're still talking 
about a limit of maybe a couple of kilowatts for the entire body.  The 
solution, of course, is to re-engineer the entire body to tolerate higher 
temperatures and put in a high-efficiency cooling system.

Its not a bad approach.  I'm pretty sure you could build a human-looking 
body capable of surviving any environment we've contemplated colonizing. 
 Of course, by the time we can do that we'll be playing with uploading and 
distributed consciousness systems, so we're not exactly talking about 
augmented humans anymore.

No problem, we'll just implant a radioactive dacay battery in your abdomen 
to power the CO2 splitter.  ;-)
