FWIW:
<br>
SQUIDS (Superconducting Quantum Interference DeviceS) are / have been in
fact used for doing multichannel high resolution EEGs.

Re: the energy angle:
<br>
It's the one (or couple) of impossible things before breakfast that makes
the story possible to tell at all--otherwise it's just ringing changes on
"I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream". If you want audience identification
as one of the six billion Earthlings ca. 1999, they have to all still be
alive for *some* reason. The logical choice for plausibly self-sufficent
(+malevolent/vengeful/paranoid) AIs makes that story impossible to tell.

<p>
The "Coppertop" explanation for why the AIs keep the humans around clearly
puts the whole affair into the technofantasy category, even with Morpheus'
backing commentary "...combined with a form of fusion..." BOGUS, d00d.

<p>
Along with that, the notion that Zion was near the core "where it's
still warm" is either utter gobbledegook or a cover story--what was Tank's
need to know? Maybe zero. What was his job? Operator. But on the face of
it, it's very hard to imagine making geothermal a complete non-option for
the Matrix-running AIs in anything like 200 years.

<p>
Re: the "Cartoon" charge:
<br>
<a name="0431qlink3">It's worthy of note that the Brothers W made it explicit that they
were trying to create a new "live action anime" genre.</a> One critical
element (which had me scratching my head--how'd they get the camera to
*do* that?--'til I checked out the Web site) is the Bullet Time array 
camera (polevaulting Grampa Muybridge neatly into a new fin-de-siecle
technology) which provided brute force razor-sharp ultraslomo
cinematography at effective frame rates up to 12K per second. 

<p>
SO yes indeed, it is/was a cartoon--by design. And quite a
conversation starter, for all its flaws.

<p>
About that Oracle Person:
<br>
_Pace_ Robin, the Oracle never claimed omniscience, and I don't
recall a single order. "She would say she knows _enough_".

<p>
Yes, it's mystical. But the whole movie is thematically isomorphic to the
Christ story. This is not an accident. Didn't the movie open right around
Easter?

<p>
MMB
<br>
suggesting it's possible to take the good with the bad (more comments
follow)

<p>
<a href="0353.html#0358qlink1">&gt; &gt;That almost makes sense, but what is the deal with not being able to</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;disconnect from the Matrix except near certain telephones? You'd think the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sane AI would provide our heros with some VR gear that doesn't kill its</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;user every time a packet is dropped.</i><br>

<p>
Remember, it's connect&amp;disconnect. I'd say it's impromptu (illegal)
(para-)ADSL to the "simulated" old style "hard lines" (copper in the
simulation--but what, outside of it? Hmmm...)

<p>
And it's possible that they play as fast and loose as they dare with the
encoding to minimize exposure to countermeasures--encode for speed, not
safety. 

<p>
And they haven't met any nice AIs yet. Maybe in Matrix III.

<p>
What I want to know is: when Thomas Anderson was at his day job, when Neo
was doing his digging by night--what was *really* going on? 

<p>
Neo's Web feeds _were_ turning up stories about Morpheus. Why? How? How
did all those leaks escape the Matrix consensus-reality enforcement? It
can't have been a good idea to even let word of Morpheus' existence out,
could it? Or was it (the info availability) a gambit to get a lever to pry
Morpheus out of the woodwork? 

<p>
<a href="0353.html#0358qlink2">&gt; One li'l tidbit: I got a real kick out of them referring to the cybercreatures hunting the rebel craft as Squids; this is, of course, what the devices which recorded subjective experience "straight off the cerebral cortex" in STRANGE DAYS were called.</a><br>
