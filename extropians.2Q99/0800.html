<a href="0794.html#0800qlink1">&gt;As far as deciding if transgender or transexual is of social or</a><br>
<i>&gt;genetic interference, this may be something we have to study more.</i><br>
<i>&gt;With the recent advances in discovering correlations between aspects</i><br>
<i>&gt;of people and a specific gene, we could soon find out if this is true</i><br>
<i>&gt;with sexuality also. This is an ongoing debate. We have seen a tie</i><br>
<i>&gt;between alcoholism and a hereditary gene already.</i><br>

<p>
Agreed. This is an issue I have looked into more than a little bit, and I
think in some cases there can be a social or environmental factor. I also
think that there are genetic predispositions and perhaps even genetic
"mandates" when it comes to such issues. I look forward to the day when we
can understand exactly how everything comes together to create sexual
identity. Or, maybe I don't entirely look forward to it. There's something
to be said for mystery:-)
