 And both removing guns from the hands of the irresponsible (violent 
 criminals, the mentally deficient and/or deranged, children, spouse 
 and/or child abusers) and preventing them from arriving there is a 
 reasonable, rational and prudent life-protection measure to take.&gt;&gt;

<p>
My point was made from an individualistic standpoint. An individual takes 
<a name="2031qlink1">action for an individual's life. Laws are not individual action, they are 
systematic violence (as I thinkwas pointed out previously). I do</a> agree that

 Not to indulge in ad populum too much, but the restrictions I have 
 advocated would be law if we had a direct vote on them, since the 
 majority of voters support them.  Next, although I wasn't the one 
 who brought the "people" up, I expect to hear all about the tyranny 
 of the majority, while hearing not a peep about the danger of one's 
 future being erased by a crazed minority of one. &gt;&gt;

<p>
Voting is not an example of an emergent phenomenon. Voting is the tyranny 
that you mention. what I was trying to say was that virtue is what people 
choose to do. One can only have a virtuous society when the people choose</a> to 
be virtuous.
 
<p>
The danger of "one's future being erased by a crazed minority of one" is 
something I am *deeply* concerned about. In fact, I try to be concerned about 
my future being erased by *anything*. I think the best way to protect my life 
is to *protect* my life. I think that finding good ivestments to avoid my 
savings from being eaten away by inflation protects my life. I think exercise 
and good nutrition protects my life. And I think owning a gun protects my 
life. 

<p>
I am sypathetic to your concerns about danger from guns; they are very 
dangerous things. I happen to think guns are very scary (though I expect this 
will lessen considerably once I learn how to use them). But ( to be cliched) 
I find being unarmed in the face of armed assailants *much* more scary. And I 
wish to avoid that situation.
