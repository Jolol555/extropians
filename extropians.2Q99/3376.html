This should include mandatory repeals of all the community gun bans, then,
in the name of consistency? Morton Grove and Oak Park here both have banned
guns - in Oak Park, ALL guns, and even driving through with a properly
stored gun in your car is illegal. I am sure they will fight tooth and nail
to preserve what they have in the face of federal 'standardization' unless
the fed law is even more restrictive..</a>

way too close to that now.
