<p>
<a name="4699qlink2">A person can dedicate their entire lives to fighting a dictator, and
still be stuck in a country in wartime as a civilian.  We don't share
collective, borg-like responsibility with everyone who happens to live
in the same geographical space as we do;</a> by that standard, the students
who died at Tianamen square would<a name="4699qlink3"> be as culpable as the soldiers who
</a>
killed them.

<a name="4699qlink4"><a name="4671qlink1">Many regimes are so oppressive that any public attempts to stop them
will guarantee a person's death.  Under such circumstances, it's very
hard to tell who supports the regime on the ground; in the air, it's
impossible.</a></a>

<a name="4699qlink5">At the very least, an attacking army should make a special effort to
avoid blowing up the prisons, the most likely location for dissenters.
