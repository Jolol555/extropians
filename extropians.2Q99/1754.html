<i>&gt; &gt; discussion...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; As far as I can tell, all my concepts about the world are "fictional", in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the sense that I made them up as a convenient way of organizing my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; experiences.  I believe all concepts are essentially fictional for the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reason.  We just made them up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First off, I can blow out of the water his claim that 'all concepts are essentially fictional'. There are many concepts describing the behavior of the universe. The universe and its behavior is not fictional.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Concepts that are not 'fictional' but based on accurate observation of the real world:</i><br>
<i>&gt; - The Big Bang</i><br>
<i>&gt; - Evolution</i><br>
<i>&gt; - Newtons Laws</i><br>
<i>&gt; - Relativity</i><br>
<i>&gt; - Quantum Mechanics</i><br>
<i>&gt; - All Mathematics</i><br>
<i>&gt; - Chemical and Atomic Physics</i><br>
<i>&gt; That we attach made up words to describe these real phenomena is irrelevant because the phenomena exist externally to our ability to label and observe them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The primary source of Natural Law for humankind is the process of Natural Selection we call Evolution. Those behaviors or cultural constructs which optimize the survival of the species and the happiness of the average individual ( a key component of the individual's ability to survive and </i><br>
reproduce  ) are behaviors and cultural constructs which are what is known as Natural Law. While the more classical, pre-scientific concepts of Natural Law merely ascribed the source to be The Creator, because anything th

<a href="1750.html#1754qlink2">&gt; Property Rights are a part of Natural Law because of the observed optimum happiness and survivability the concept lends to individuals, families, and large groups of people. It limits conflicts by communicating clearly what belongs to who, as conflict is the result of confusion or incomplete </a><br>
information about some issue that two or more parties have a property related interest in. It ensures that an individual, family or group of individuals can rely on the resources that the Property Rights define for the

<a href="1750.html#1754qlink5">&gt; While the above statement may seem gingoistic to some, lets look further back in history. The Roman Republic, for example, was at the time the most organized and at the same time the most libertarian society around. The concepts of Natural Law as elucidated by Aristotle and other Greeks were </a><br>
worshipped by the Romans. Because of this, Rome was able to acheive a level of greatness unmatched to that point in history. As soon as the Republic was abdicated and the Empire instituted, however, the seeds of the en

<a href="1750.html#1754qlink6">&gt; Given all of this, I feel I can safely conclude that Property Rights are an abstraction of Natural Selection that benefits the evolution of the human race far more than the lack of such rights.

that evolution and the physical laws that make evolution possible are  fictional concepts.

<a name="1785qlink1">You are fallaciously mixing hard science and soft (human) science, 
as well as throwing history in (which is no kind of science 
whatsoever), and being defensive about it because even you know 
that you are doing it.  I am a believer in private property rights; 
however I am intellectually honest enough with myself and others 
to admit that it is a belief of mine rather than an item of scientific 
knowledge.  Please strive to be this honest yourself.  You believe 
in the abolition of government, but by your own historical argument 
(which you use to justify property rights), government is an 
evolution of Natural Law, having been with us for countless 
millennia.  Consistency counts; please try to demonstrate some of 
it.
