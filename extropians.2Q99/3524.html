<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; My neighbours don't have guns.  No one I know has a gun. I live in a</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; to live in a country where everyone has guns is mad.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; So said the sheep to the mountain goat. You do know policemen? Military personnel?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Your government representatives? They all have guns, and are in a position to tell</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you how you can live your life. You have no guns, and therefore cannot resist what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they tell you. There is one word to describe such a society: fascism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jesus what a load of something I'm not allowed to mention.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So tell me, Mr Superman Lorrey with your World Famous LorreyDrive: how</i><br>
<i>&gt; the hell do YOU with your Big! Manly! Testosterone-Oozing! Guns! plan to</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep the government at bay? Do you brazenly watch kiddie snuff porn and</i><br>
<i>&gt; ingest drugs while listening to Hakim Bey read the communist manifesto,</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; proud and secure in your knowledge that you can keep these dastardly</i><br>
<i>&gt; forces of oppression from the door?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is so much complete toss. you maniacs rant and rave about freedom!</i><br>
<i>&gt; and liberty! and strength! and yet you are under the thumb of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; country which imprisons more of it's own than everyone else aside from</i><br>
<i>&gt; Russia, and you are scheduled to pass that figure in October.</i><br>

<p>
Apparently only you and the "calm, reasonable, and rational" Mr. Dees are the only ones
who have descended to ranting and raving here.

<p>
<a name="3574qlink2"><a href="3500.html#3524qlink2">&gt; So I ask you again: how have *your* guns prevented government</a><br>
<i>&gt; oppression? How *will* your guns prevent government oppression.  do you</i><br>
<i>&gt; really think you have enough firepower to hold off a military force?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sure the swiss own guns, but they have military weapons: you guys don't.</i><br>

<p>
Of course we do. The "assault weapons" ban was pure fluff, and it did not outlaw any
guns that were not already in private ownership. It just takes a little longer to get
fully automatic stuff, but it can be gotten by any law abiding citizen, along with
mortars and other fun stuff. I have a group of freinds who hold what they call "AK days"</a>
on occasion.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3574qlink3"><a href="3500.html#3524qlink3">&gt; &gt; &gt; No one needs to have weapons to kill people at a distance.  The only</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; reason to have them is to protect yourself from people who have them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Argh, shit, I'm being sucked into this stupid argument again!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Its a matter of you refusing to acknowledge your own blind spots. Who protects you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; from the government?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The laws, the army and the police.  What on earth makes you think that</i><br>
<i>&gt; we could hold off the govt? Do you think you and your gun-totin' mates</i><br>
<i>&gt; can hold of yours?</i><br>
</a>
<p>
We do.

<p>
<a name="3574qlink4"><a href="3500.html#3524qlink4">&gt; &gt; From the criminals who do not obey your laws against gun</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ownership?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Um, what makes you think that criminals would defend the people against</i><br>
<i>&gt; the govt?  Or are you engaging in yet more sophistry?</i><br>

<p>
Your reading comprehension is dropping again.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3574qlink5"><a href="3500.html#3524qlink5">&gt; If it comes down to having to build weapons to defend myself from the</a><br>
<i>&gt; govt, I can assure you I will build something a hell of a lot more</i><br>
<i>&gt; powerful than a rifle, because I'm aware of something you seem to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignorant of: rifles won't stop tanks and fighter aircraft.  Until then I</i><br>
<i>&gt; will quite happily live in my safe, peaceful, disarmed community.</i><br>

<p>
Tell that to the Vietnamese. Small arms brought down quite a number of jet aircraft in
that war. As for tanks, they are nothing a little fertilizer and oil cannot stop.</a>
