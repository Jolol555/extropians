<a name="3158qlink1">I take your point, but it doesn't doesn't work in this case as the total 
number of goods is specified.

<p>
Even if the 5% of goods are free, the entire other 95%, can't be above the
average price.</a>

<p>
Anyhow, the answer is in. Cynthia was comparing her 15 iqtest.com scores to
her single well-normed IQ score.

<p>
As iq.test.com appears to give scores that are normed to an average of 120,
the entire issue is explained away, and we are left with a nice big g-factor
of general ability once more.
