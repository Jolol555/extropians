<i>&gt; You often see women slapping men on TV/movies. In your scenario, on</i><br>

Well, no, thats not my point. My point is that there are two standards we can compare
here, and see which results in more violence. We have:
a) a case where its ok to use non-lethal, minimally harmful violence against even
merely offensive behavior, where the user of force is not held responsible, and
b) a case where it is not ok under any but the worst circumstances, and will usually
result in a review by others of whether it was responsible action, and the weilder is
much more likely to cause actual harm.

<p>
In this case, we see that standard (a) results in more violence than (b). It is for
this reason that I argue that unless the bar of seriousness in the use and
consequences of force is not a high one, there will be the result of more, not less
violence, which could trigger even more lethal violence as a retaliatory action
against non-lethal violence.
