<a href="3061.html#3198qlink1">&gt; LONDON (Reuters) - British campaigners against genetically modified (GM)</a><br>
<i>&gt; crops claimed victory Monday after a farmer bowed to local opposition and</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroyed his trial crop of GM oilseed rape with weedkiller.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
This isn't just the Green party. Food scares have become a staple part
of the British media diet in recent years, and for good reason: consider
the BSE crisis as an example of how major problems are covered up, then
bear in mind that something like 80% of the food sold in the UK is
sold through five supermarket chains.

<p>
The anti-GM backlash isn't rational, but it's an understandable outcome
of a situation where lots of people have been lied to -- with potentially
fatal consequences -- and the media has noticed that bad news about food
sells copy.  The politicians are already shifting gear from making soothing
noises about committees of enquiry to hedging about moratoria: they've seen
which way the wind is blowing.

<p>
I'm coming to fear that the prospects for GM food in the UK resemble 
those for neighbourhood nuclear fission reactors in the USA: it's going
to turn into the next big taboo subject.
