Everything in moderation!

<p>
    If you take an objective look at many of the papers on diet (especially
for diabetics) it is clear that the large, well controlled studies show that
a balanced diet is usually the most effective one in lowering body fat
percentages and increasing wellness overall.  Unfortunately, we in western
countries sometimes have a skewed view of what a "balanced diet" actually
is.
<p>
    High levels of carbs are DEADLY!  The high carb diets previously
advocated by the ADA and the AHA have been shown to exacerbate most of the
problems experienced by most type II diabetics.  On the other hand, high
protein diets are not particularly healthy either.  High levels of protein
can cause ketosis (the Atkin's Diet actually seeks to cause this condition),
a condition which in addition to causing some biochemical changes which
aren't too healthy puts fat cells in a mode where they are more likely to
store fat.
<p>
    So, the consensus seems to be that high anything is not good for you.
<a name="1481qlink1">Some of the current books on low carbs/ high protein are actually just a
balanced diet, it only appears different because the western diet</a> is far too
<a name="1481qlink2">high in fat and carb calories.</a>  These books have not stated anything
revolutionary from a biochemical standpoint, it is just that the medical
community has had their head in the sand for about twenty years and these
people are just stating the obvious. (With the exception of Dr. Walford who
has been saying the same things for quite a while)
<p>
    I have not read Eades book so I can't comment on his strategies but I
have read some of Dr. Barry Sears' "Zone" series (It is NOT a high protein
diet by any means) and he is about as close to reflecting a good, practical
diet for weight loss and anti-aging as I have seen.  Unless of course if you
want to go in for caloric restriction, which is more effective, but terribly
spartan for my taste.  If you have the discipline, then Dr. Walford's
program is for you.  It also is a balanced diet, it just has much fewer
calories overall.
<p>
    Some links for you:

         Dr. Roy Walford's site: www.walford.com

    I am assembling a bibliography on this topic right now.  It should be
available via the web in a couple of weeks.  I'll post when it goes up.
