You don't necessarily need to understand something in order to clone its
effects. For example, I work in genetics and we don't understand how most
enzymes or genes work. But still we claim to control DNA and we manipulate
it and optimize metabolic processes that no-one really understands. As for
AI, you don't have to clone all neurons to make an artificial brain. All
you need is the information processing power and a way to make that
processing power learn and evolve. There are many possible choices on how
to do that but we still don't have the processing power of a brain. Long
before we understand the human brain there will be AI more intelligent than
us.

<p>
Hasta.
