<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But of COURSE you are not racist, and OF COURSE you mean the word as a</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Damn that Damien for being a nancy-boy kneejerker with no clue, eh?</i><br>

<a name="2725qlink1">Now who is knee jerking? The context that I used the word, with no knowledge of the
particular political correctness of the word in a region on the opposite side of the
planet from me, was merely as a means of abbreviating.</a> Its also quite convenient for
you to ignore my italian ancestry.<a name="2725qlink2"> Even today in many parts of the US, when people
find out you are italian and from the east coast, they automatically think you are in
the mafia. When my grandfather married an italian girl in the 1930's, his family
would not talk to him for years, prejudice was so widespread back then. To most
WASPs, being white means being of NORTHERN european descent, and specifically of
English descent. Anyone who is not ignorant of history knows what the English did to
the Scots after Culloden. Apparently</a> you are.

<p>
<a name="2725qlink3">I was talking with some freinds the other day about this, and we were mocking the
demands of a few years ago for apologies to the african americans. At the same time
their ancestors were getting enslaved by the British, my Scottish ancestors were
getting exterminated by the British. Why the hell should I, or my representatives,
have to apologize to them?</a> None of my ancestors even came to the US until after the
<a name="2725qlink4">civil war. One of my buddies noted that his danish ancestors were held under martial
law by the Swedes way back when, so I summarily apologized to him for the actions of
my Swedish ancestors on his Danish ancestors.</a>

<p>
<a name="2725qlink5">Now I suppose if you REALLY stretch it, I would have to apologize for my Roman Empire
ancestors and what they did to the Carthaginians, the Egyptians, the Jews, the
French, and the British. Let me say right here: I am truly sorry people I never met
or gained an ounce of benefit from opressed people you never met or gained an ounce
of benefit from. Happy now?</a>
