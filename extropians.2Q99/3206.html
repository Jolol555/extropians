You're really into this assuming that you know what other people are 
assuming about you, aren't you?

<p>
I'm not 'assuming you're a liar', I'm assuming that because you're 'careless
and frivolous about facts' that nothing you post as a supposed fact can be
trusted without verification, particularly when it disagrees with what I
remember. You were wrong about 75% of the facts of this incident; why should
I trust you on the other 25%?

<p>
And it's kind of hard to have a discussion with someone who's as 'careless
and frivolous about facts' as you are.

<p>

<p>
Maybe you should spend more time being careful about facts and less time 
jumping to assumptions.
