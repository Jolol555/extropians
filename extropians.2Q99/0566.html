<i>&gt;  "transhuman."  That's just asking for trouble.  I don't want to be part of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  God's Chosen Transhumanity, or the Transhuman Master Race (which are two</i><br>

<i>&gt;  bodybuilder.  I don't think primitive humans will have a problem with that.</i><br>

<p>
I agree that applying labels to one's self that emphasize one's superiority 
over other people is unwise, generally, but I feel compelled to comment on a 
couple of points here.  First, no one within the transhuman community 
explicitly labels themselves or their aspirations "God's Chosen 
Transhumanity", or the "Transhuman Master Race": These are terms that create 
a negative caricature of the ideas most of us share.  The first emphasizes a 
notion of "predestination" that most of us either explicitly disavow or don't 
see as the primary focus of future human evolution. To the extent that 
transhumanists find it highly likely that some form of life more capable than 
current humans will develop is to do no more than observe the adaptive 
process of evolution in action and project it forward. In any case, it 
injects a theological notion into the discourse that is of course completely 
foreign to our thinking.  The second caricature refers to concepts of mastery 
and evokes Nazi ideology that is, again, utterly foreign to extropian values.

<p>
As to the use of the term "transhuman", I agree that it may well connote a 
concept of superiority to many people.  But I do not find that it universally 
evokes the notion of condescension inherent in the exaggerated terms you 
mention.  To the extent that it does, I think it behooves us to work at 
countering such perceptions.

<p>
Now, I've certainly considered the idea that it might be better to pursue the 
goals of transhumanism in a stealthy fashion, so that people's fears won't be 
triggered by the perception that some segment of humanity is somehow the 
beneficiary of "unfair" and "unnatural" advantages.  If I believed that 
omnipotent "genie machines" could be developed within my lifetime, overnight, 
by a small group of people working in relative isolation, I might endorse 
such a strategy.  But I know you don't think such a thing is likely, Lyle.  
And neither do I.

<p>
As to the reaction of "primitive humans" to being a "ridiculously healthy 
bodybuilder", I believe you can't escape the issue in this way.  From my many 
discussions about these subjects with as broad a cross-section of people as 
I've been able to engage, I find that people who have not embraced the 
concept of transhumanity ultimately "draw the line" at "artificial" 
biological augmentation.  The minute you exhibit visible and obvious signs of 
physical or mental capacity beyond what can be achieved by "natural", 
unaugmented humans, you will have to come to terms with the fear most people 
have of being superseded by some "unfair advantage" and the revulsion most 
people feel at the "unnatural".

<p>
In sum, without a community of technically competent people who have at least 
implicitly accepted the goals of transhumanism, how do you hope to have 
access to radical augmentation technologies and, without some work having 
been done to blunt and assuage the widespread fear of such augmentation, how 
do you plan to avoid social prohibitions on augmentation technology?

<a href="0561.html#0566qlink2">&gt;  I don't want to be a Power, but the situation leaves me no choice.  In the</a><br>
<i>&gt;  coming decades I intend to build an elaborate bodyguard around myself, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  protect myself from violence of all kinds.  The external immune system is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  just as important as the internal immune system.   </i><br>

<p>
Without meaning to be overly personalistic, is your goal to become immensely 
wealthy, and then achieve transhuman goals or become posthuman "on your own", 
in secret, while protected by an elaborate security system.  Can you say 
"Fortress of Solitude"?  Seriously, this seems possible, but far less 
probable than achieving these goals in concert with other people who share 
them, and by taking advantage of a wide community of researchers and 
businesses working to develop and provide the benefits of human augmentation 
technology.  From what you write below, I suspect that you think that it is 
not effective to try to build such a community through propagating the ideas 
and values of transhumanism.  While I don't think that simply spreading the 
memes of transhumanism is a sufficient condition for achieving post-human 
status, I do think that working to build understanding and acceptance of 
those ideas and values is at least ONE important step in building and then 
having the benefit of a community of the right kind of people working 
together to achieve those goals.

<a href="0561.html#0566qlink3">&gt;  My experience of poker is much more limited, but it tends to confirm your</a><br>
<i>&gt;  experience.  However, poker is basically a waste of time.  </i><br>

<p>
I'm not a poker player, but I can't help but note that it is, after all, a 
GAME and games aren't a "waste of time" in the sense that 1) play is 
important to the psychological health of any mammal, especially primates 
(and, I suspect, any sentient being) and 2) most games offer at least SOME 
strategic insight beyond their own realm.

<p>
<i>&gt;  It doesn't lead</i><br>
<a href="0561.html#0566qlink4">&gt;  anywhere, and you can't make real money (hundreds of millions of dollars)</a><br>
<i>&gt;  playing poker.  </i><br>

<p>
Through an odd turn of events, I was exposed for a while to the realm of 
top-level professional poker players.  The highest echelon of these people 
make as much as tens of millions of dollars in their careers.  So, while it's 
certainly not a "good bet" as a career choice :-) and you're right that you 
can't make HUNDREDS of millions of dollars playing poker (unless you get into 
that big game with Bill Gates), it is actually possible to make some pretty 
good dinero playing the game.

<p>
<a href="0561.html#0566qlink5">&gt;  Poker tests your perception of your immediate surroundings,</a><br>
<i>&gt;  but the real challenge is to decide which game to play.  That's the real</i><br>

<p>
I certainly agree with this.
  
<p>
<a href="0561.html#0566qlink6">&gt;  In war, technology and physical skills do have a big impact, and they</a><br>
<i>&gt;  depend on planning.  You have to foresee years or decades in advance that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  you need technology and physical skills, and get ready for the moment when</i><br>
<i>&gt;  those things are needed.  The technology that you bring to the battlefield</i><br>
<i>&gt;  reflects your perception of reality.  In business, you have to decide years</i><br>
<i>&gt;  or decades in advance which business to go into, and how to prepare for it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and then implement your plan.  It may be true that even those with fuzzy</i><br>
<i>&gt;  minds can make money, but it is also true that a lot of people lose money. </i><br>

<p>
I agree with all of that.

<p>
<a href="0561.html#0566qlink7">&gt;  Extropy.com, for example, is in debt.  There is no money to be made in</a><br>
<i>&gt;  propagating memes.  That's the wrong business to go into.  </i><br>

<p>
<a name="0665qlink2">Tell that to Ted Turner, Pablo Picasso, Oscar de la Renta, James Cameron or 
Oprah Winfrey</a> . . . well, you get my point.
  
<p>
<a name="0665qlink3">No one expects to get rich propagating transhuman ideas</a> or extropian values, 
per se. (Although it COULD happen, I doubt it's likely any time soon.)  With 
all due respect, Lyle, I think you may be attacking a straw man, but one that 
you aren't the first to attack.  I've encountered expressions of impatience 
with Extropy Institute and this mailing list before to the effect that "This 
is all just TALK!  You people aren't DOING anything!  TALK won't get you 
anywhere!"  Well, to use the vernacular, "duh!"  You don't expect to find 
anything but "talk" on a mailing list, and a non-profit networking 
organization isn't itself the vehicle to develop new technologies or make 
money.  If you drive your car into the water, you shouldn't be surprised if 
it doesn't do a good job as a submarine.

<p>
But memetic propagation and networking ARE valuable precursors to profitable 
achievement of transhuman goals.  Just as Tsiolkovsky's, Oberth's and 
Goddard's writing and then networking were necessary elements of a foundation 
for spaceflight (I'll be glad to explain why, if you doubt this), so 
exploring and developing the ideas and values of transhumanism and 
extropianism, and building networks of people who share those ideas and 
values, is also a valuable activity in these early days of augmenting the 
human animal.  It's entirely possible to be a "free rider" in this process, 
Lyle: Even people who don't actively participate in the early stages of 
memetic development and propagation will benefit from those efforts.  The 
networking aspects are a different matter, though: "Going it alone" has its 
disadvantages.

<p>
<a href="0561.html#0566qlink8">&gt;  We are entering the age of memetic competition.  What kind of meme can</a><br>
<i>&gt;  create a phenotype around itself that has the strength to survive and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  become immortal?  An ism?  A corporation?  or some new kind of meme?  </i><br>
