Yes, New York and Southern New England are very high tax, highly regulatory, and
trade protective. Vermont, while its one shining example of liberty is that you
need no permit to carry concealed weapons, it has also passed state controlled
health care systems, centralized the education funding tax system, has been the
leader in the New England Dairy Compact, which maintains high milk prices and
excludes non-regional milk, and infringed on the property rights of landowners
to a great extent. New Hampshire is slowly becoming more like Massachusetts,
especially the southeast portion. We've gone to a centralized property tax
system for education funding and more and more gun restriction proposals come to
votes in the legislature every year, despite their clear violation not only of
the US Constitution, but Article 2a of the state constitution, which is even
more clear than the US version.
