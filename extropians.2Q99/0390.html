Keep in mind that the agent that was yapping off was saying all sorts of
untrue things just in order to memetically break Morpheus. I would just
as easily beleive that the original AI conned people into jacking in
with the promise of paradise, enslaved them, and used them to expand its
own power.

this sense in the back of my mind that reality was thus, which would
come to the fore after an intense meditation session, or after being on
nitrous oxide for a long while at the dentist.</a> Tonite upon the ending of
the movie I have had the longest period of this sort of sensation I have
ever had (don't worry, no flying happened ;D ). It's been an hour and it
is only now starting to subside. No drugs, no stimulants, not even soda.

Another thing I noticed was how the theater seemed to be populated by
every wannabe hacker in the Upper Valley.

The towers of people plugged into the system reminds me of the Shrike's
Tree of Pain in Simmons' Hyperion novels.
