     "Thinking Like a Serial Killer"

<p>
<i>&gt; The Washington state attorney general's office is</i><br>
<i>&gt; currently testing neural network software designed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; comb through thousands of crime reports to track down</i><br>
<i>&gt; serial killers and rapists. Neural networks are computer</i><br>
&gt; systems designed to find patterns in data by mimicking<br>
&gt; human thought processes. <br>

<p>
<a name="2490qlink1">Do these guys have any idea how easy it is to fool an AI?  Even a
human-equivalent mind wouldn't have any of the defenses humans evolved
over the generations, and a neural network is deterministically
misleadable.  While I strongly support the development of AI, I
categorically oppose the use of any AI in social structures; it's just
too easy to abuse or outright crack.  Opaque AI like neural networks is
even worse.</a>

<p>
Imagine the following scene in your local courtroom:

<p>
<a name="2470qlink1">Prosecutor: You're accused of killing eight nuns with an icepick.
Defendant:  What's the evidence?
<br>
Prosecutor: Our neural network says you did it.
Defendant:  Why does it say that?
<br>
Prosecutor: Um, nobody knows.
<br>
Defendant:  That's it?  That's your evidence?
Prosecutor [to jury]:  Hey, look at all these cool blinking lights!
<pre>
                       Technology!  Whoo-ah!  It's never wrong!
Jury:       Guilty.
Judge:      I sentence you to death.</a>

</pre>
<p>
But that would require government stupidity, right?  So I'm sure it will
never happen.
