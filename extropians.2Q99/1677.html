As in my prior reply, your contention that property rights are a 'fictional concept'. Property is a concept of Natural Law, and trying to fictionalize something as real as that is just another meme that the totalitarian forces use to destroy the rights of the individual. It is evil in every sense of the word.

How have I done that? I did observe that if you practice your rude, obnoxious, condescending ways of poking people's buttons in real life, I wouldn't be surprised if you got your nose broken at least once for your actions. That is not to imply that it would be me doing it. I consider myself a rather non-violent and non-confrontational person, but I am rather adamant about defending my own rights. I will not ever shy away from that. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.<a name="4008qlink1"> Live free or die, death is not the worst of evils.</a> No one who values the freedom of the individual need fear me. Those that don't, do, though.

<p>
If anyone is using straw man tactics, it is you.
