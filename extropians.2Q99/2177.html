<a href="2165.html#2177qlink1">&gt; Joe, you're hurting your credibility.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
My credibility is just fine.  The credibility of the rabid full-moon gun 
nuts on this list is nonexistent.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2205qlink1"><i>&gt;  Several posters, including</i><br>
<a href="2165.html#2177qlink2">&gt; myself, have raised the question of what standards of proof and due</a><br>
<i>&gt; process your concept would require.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
That has never been before raised to my knowledge (post a past 
mail and prove me wrong), but any due process that any other 
purported offence is granted seems equitable.</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You resort to profanity and</i><br>
<a href="2165.html#2177qlink3">&gt; crass insults but don't answer the concerns based on historically</a><br>
<i>&gt; documented abuse of gun registration laws to disarm minorities</i><br>
<i>&gt; (sometimes as a prelude to genocide or "ethnic cleansing").</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
That will not happen here, due in part to several constitutional 
amendments.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2165.html#2177qlink4">&gt; The biggest loophole in your proposal is "Mentally deficient or</a><br>
<i>&gt; deranged".  It is a documented fact that allowing bureaucracies to</i><br>
<i>&gt; determine who is deficient or deranged can be abused, (viz. Germany</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1936), and you wrote,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
As it was in the Soviet union, yet (contrary to the beliefs and/or 
wishes of some on this list) we have neither a communist nor a 
fascist government, but a constitutional democracy whose citizens 
possess rights to life, liberty, property, appeal, public defence and 
public advocacy.  Stop arguing against America by bringing up the 
sickle and swastika herrings.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2205qlink2"><a href="1999.html#2177qlink5">&gt;   "To support my point I state this:  The guy I was just referring</a><br>
<i>&gt;    to who stated he would rather kill a police officer (who most</i><br>
<i>&gt;    likely has a wife and family) or other law enforcement officers</i><br>
<i>&gt;    than have his gun taken away SHOULD have his license revoked</i><br>
<i>&gt;    for saying that and have his weapons taken away as he is</i><br>
<i>&gt;    talking like a potential killer and is clearly a threat to</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the general public from my perspective."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Ahh, the domino theory again!  First of all, I didn't write</a> that.  
Second of all, how long would you tolerate an agressive blusterer 
brandishing a weapon at your wife and kids?  No longer than your 
average police officer, I assume.  But he should not be forced to 
relinquish his weapon for merely stating that he would defend his 
home and person.  Try using MY rhetoric against me next time; I'd 
truly appreciate it if you'd get it right.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2165.html#2177qlink6">&gt; Here we see an example of the slippery slope- you claim that this</a><br>
<i>&gt; person is deranged *only* due to his political views.  Of the groups</i><br>
<i>&gt; on your list below, only _convicted_ violent criminals and children</i><br>
<i>&gt; may be unequivocally denied the right to keep and bear arms- the</i><br>
<i>&gt; others would be an open door to political oppression and tyranny.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
More flowery rhetoric of the Tim McVeigh type.  You own the T-
shirt?  Mike Lorrey'll sell you one.  I'll send all the armed 
schizophrenics over to your house, ok?
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2165.html#2177qlink7">&gt; You want<a name="2205qlink3"> to disarm the man described above simply because he *does</a><br>
<i>&gt; not want to be disarmed*, and is willing to fight such oppression.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
As long as the cops aren't banging down his door, there's no 
problem.  If he's a nut, kid or criminal, they SHOULD be taking his 
gun away, and better that he die than some shnook on the street 
who looks like a good target to him.</a>
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="2205qlink4"><a href="2165.html#2177qlink8">&gt; Now do you see why some of us question your motives and goals?  Your</a><br>
<i>&gt; thinking is a catch-22... you seem to be saying that as long as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; person doesn't mind being forcibly disarmed, he may (might?) keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; those arms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
If they abrogate their rights by committing violent crimes, abusing 
their spouses and/or children, developing legitimately certifiable 
psychoses, then they NEED to be disarmed, and the sooner the 
better.  If not, there's no problem.</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2165.html#2177qlink9">&gt; You feel that people are misquoting and misrepresenting you.  I</a><br>
<i>&gt; quote you verbatim, then point out your logical inconsistency.  Can</i><br>
<i>&gt; we discuss this without inflammatory words and rhetoric?</i><br>
