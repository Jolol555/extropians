I am curious why you think it is hideous that I desire to share the value
I have with others and that I desire to persuade others to do the same. 
I happen to realize that my future and the futures of everyone on the
planet are inextricably intertwined.  If I help someone succeed or
persuade others to help people succeed, those helped may go on to
generate ideas and technologies that I will benefit from.  As an
individual, my most effecient and powerful means of getting what I want
in the world is to share my valuable ideas with others who have similar
goals and who will use my ideas to further our mutual goals.

<p>
I don't see why you find my generosity "hideous".  Unless you have
already determined that none of my ideas are of value to you, it seems
like it would be in your own best interest to encourage me to share my
ideas freely, as I have planned, rather than trying to intimidate me with
your insults.

<p>
If I gave you an idea that you could market and make millions of dollars,
would you still consider my promotion of generosity "hideous"?  Why are
you so against me simply sharing what I have and encouraging others to do
the same?
