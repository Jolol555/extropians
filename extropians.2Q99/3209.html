I don't think he assumed you were a liar, just that the student was acting
pretty stupidly to keep walking toward a man with a gun who was telling him to
freeze, repeatedly. Its just something you don't do. If someone points a gun at
you, you basically have two options: a) raise your hands and drop to the ground,
or b) pull your own gun and start shooting. Approaching a person with a pointed
gun is an indication of intent to disarm. There is no reason for the homeowner
to consider that the student did not understand English. Such considerations can
get you killed.
