Bright Future For Buckyball? -- Device Based On Soccer Ball-Shaped Molecules
Emits White Light For The First Time
<br>
Conventional scientific wisdom says so-called "buckyballs," sixty carbon
atoms bound together in the form of a soccer ball, are extremely efficient
at quenching light. Now, however, University of California researchers say
they have observed the opposite: "the first known example" of white light
being given off from a device made of a buckyball derivative.
The development is detailed in a communication to Journal of the American
Chemical Society. The peer-reviewed journal is published by the American
Chemical Society (ACS), the world's largest scientific society. Text became
available on the ACS web May 29 and will appear in the journal's June 16
print edition.

<p>
It is relatively easy to produce small molecule or polymeric organic
materials that emit orange, yellow, and green light. Deep blue and white
light are possible, but a bit more difficult. In fact, several companies are
developing organic light emitting devices that they hope to use in products
ranging from cell phone displays to automobile bumpers. Until now, however,
the use of light-killing buckyballs for such applications seemed
unthinkable.

<p>
The UC scientists added attachments to buckyballs that modify their
electronic structure and allow them to emit light. UCLA chemist and
co-author Fred Wudl, Ph.D., currently regards their new device as "an
academic curiosity, because normally buckyballs quench luminescence very
effectively and here it actually gives off light." Practically speaking, its
efficiency is extremely low (only a fraction of a percent of electric power
supplied is converted to light) and buckyballs are currently relatively
expensive.

<p>
The UCLA chemist who first made the buckyball device, co-author Yves Rubin,
Ph.D., still allows himself to dream: "Such white light devices might
ultimately be used to illuminate rooms by covering a ceiling or wall with
the material." At the moment, however, it seems that the companies working
on simpler organic materials have a big head start on such applications,
according to Wudl.

<p>
Other co-authors on the paper are Kate Hutchison, Ph.D. and June Gao, Ph.D.
of UC, Santa Barbara and Georg Schick, Ph.D., of UCLA.
