I think we must be careful about making assumptions about when
different applications of nanotechnology become viable, I have noted
that a lot of people seem to think that once we have an assembler just
about everything will be built in a short order. I don't think so.

<p>
Nanoimmune systems are of course a very good idea, and I would guess
medical nanotech will be one of the first major applications (depite
all the restrictions, medical technology is a very profitable business
and the transfer from basic research to application is fairly well
streamlined). Most likely they will be in place before the ufog, even
if they are crude. However, dealing with debris in the lungs and food
is already done by macrophages and their intestinal counterparts; my
guess it is a good idea to design the ufog to manageable by them
rather than assuming everybody will have a nanoimmune system.
