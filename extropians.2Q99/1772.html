<p>
There's a wonderful book on human temperament, "Please Understand Me"
It describes current scientific results of personality profiling, and
includes
<br>
a simple self-administered personality test.

<p>
I mention this because most of the people attracted to science and math
seem to
<br>
be the exact opposite of shallow.  They tend to be extremely driven by
intuition,
<br>
not sensory experiences.  In general such people tend to figure things
out
<br>
from first principles, and to be fond of deep chains of logic and
causation.

<p>
I don't think sensory equipment has anything to do with temperament.  I
think brain structure probably has a lot to do with it, though.
