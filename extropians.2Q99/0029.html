My mistake - I was referring to the type of rockets whose use was pioneered by the Nazis in their bombardment of London, and which now can carry nukes trans-globally, and, mistakenly it appears, depending upon the intelligence of my interlocuters to infer this from their pairing with nukes in the phrase "rockets and nukes."  Wouldja like everyone to own a personal battery of THOSE, O Rabid One?
