Walter John Williams' _Aristoi_ has an interesting take on
things. Beside having a stable, wealthy society where every child is
wanted (due to a low reproduction rate) which of course in itself
promotes mental health to a large extent, people used various mental
techniques to control their emotions and thinking. From an early age
they learned tricks like meditation, posture and other mental
exercises, as well as having a language/symbolism that had been
deliberately designed to make discussing psychological states and
techniques easy. In addition, people had deliberately created multiple
personalities - the various aspects of the psyche could be separated
(through more or less radical means, ranging from hypnosis to
gruelling rituals) and then employed as semi-independent
subpersonalities connected to AI.
