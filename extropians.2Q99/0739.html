Making the genders more like each other doesn't necessarily help anything
(imagine two partners with the teenage male 'constant lust without
commitment' syndrome).  What you would need to do is identify a specific
model for how relationships should work, and then modify one or both genders
to better fit that model.

<p>
Now, if that sounds morally iffy, it should.  I expect a lot of the world's
more conservative regimes would want to pick a 'one best way' for everyone
(usually on religious grounds), and force-fit everyone into it.  Hopefully
they won't get the chance.

<p>
However, in a free society this is something individuals could do for
themselves.  You decide what you think the perfect relationship would be
like, and then you change yourself to fit this vision.  Then you find a
partner (or partners - lets not be narrow-minded here) who share the same
vision.
