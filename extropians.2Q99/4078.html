We tried keyword prefixes before, without any automatic 
enforcement (e.g., the META: in this subject), and as you can see, 
the practice didn't survive. I seem to remember that META: was the 
most frequently honored keyword back when others were in use.

<p>
A strongly-keyworded list and email filters is one way of modelling 
multiple lists (analogous to using concatenated keys in a 
database). This makes it a little easier to change "subscriptions" 
as one's interests change, or as threads deteriorate.

<a name="4092qlink1">Indulging in simplification for a moment, the problem with mailing 
lists and newsgroups is their sequential nature. Various other 
models for online discussion forums, such as the many variations 
on hypertext, attempt to add "random access" to the medium.

<p>
The www is roughly half of a hypertext system -- it's missing a 
commenting feature. Considering the uproar about the recent 
introduction of "postits" [1] (memory failure: I just saw this on wired 
news and don't remember what it's called), it seems unlikely that 
the www as a whole will embrace dynamic commenting any time 
soon. This doesn't mean that a site couldn't implement it, and 
maybe some have (research topic for later).</a>

<p>
Another interesting example is dejanews. By archiving netnews 
and providing a searching and thread-following front-end, it has 
improved the usefulness of netnews greatly. It's sort of like a very 
watered-down hypertext.

<p>
Sorry to present all questions and hints and no answers here, 
maybe I can improve on that later. Perhaps this is a good topic for 
the chat.

[1] The gist of this was that someone unleashed a browser, or 
browser plugin, that allowed anyone to attach notes to any www 
page, and other people using the same plugin could see the notes. 
A lot of site owners were all huffy about this, considering it a form 
of electronic graffiti, and citing examples of abuse, like people 
leaving notes about their porn sites all over pages that had nothing 
to do with adult content, and other such spam. I guess the real 
fundamental issue is that people need to grow up.
