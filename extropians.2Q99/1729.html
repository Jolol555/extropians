<a name="1755qlink1"><a name="1732qlink2"><a name="1731qlink1">OK, here's one I've been wanting to ask someone about.

<p>
<a name="1738qlink1">I love the new Pentium III commercial, the one that shows a
robot being built and walking around to the tune of this
really cool song that I'm just dying to get on CD.  Does
anyone know the name of the song or the artist who sings</a> it?
</a>

<p>
Do you remember the tune?  It's got a cool guitar riff under
lyrics that go something like this:

<p>
"I feel pretty... Oh so pretty... I feel pretty, and witty,
and bright.... and I'll [something]... any girl who comes to
me tonight  [la, la, la, la, la, la la la]

<p>
I feel charming... Oh so charming... It's alarming, I'm
charming, and [something, something, something, etc.]"


<p>
PLEASE help me out, it's driving me crazy.  Lately I've
found myself flipping around endlessly just to catch that
one commercial.


<p>

<p>
P.S. I've teared up at the Cisco ads before, too.  As well
</a>
</a>
as at the Phillips-Magnavox ads with the "It's getting
better all the time" jingle.  I'm a sap for progess  :)
