Unique Neurons Make People, Apes Smart - Report
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A unique type of brain cell seems to separate 
humans and apes from lower animals, and may make them smarter, 
scientists say.

<p>
But the neuron clusters come at a price -- they may make us 
susceptible to diseases such as Alzheimer's, the researchers at the 
California Institute of Technology and Mount Sinai School of Medicine 
in New York said.

<p>
The large, spindle-shaped cells are found in humans, bonobos, 
chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, but not any other type of 
animal, Patrick Hof of Mount Sinai and his colleagues report in this 
week's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

<p>
Bonobos are a type of chimpanzee recently found to be a distinct 
species and more closely related to humans than other chimpanzees. 
And Hof's team also found that bonobos have more of these cells than 
the other apes.

<p>
``This declining concentration matches the degree of relatedness of <br>
these apes to humans,'' John Allman of Caltech said in a statement.

<p>
The brain cells could finally offer what many people have searched 
for -- a defining element that separates humans from the animal world.

<p>
Criteria have fallen by the wayside one by one with discoveries that 
gerbils have a fairly sophisticated language to warn of predators, 
that birds use tools and that dolphins can respond to the grammatical 
structure in hand signals.

<p>
Several chimpanzees have been taught to use either sign language or 
computers to communicate and have been shown to use original thought 
in structuring sentences.

<p>
Hof and Allman's team looked at 28 different species of primate, and 
at humans who died and had autopsies.

<p>
<a name="1091qlink1">They found their spindle cells in the anterior cingulate cortex of 
the brain, which controls automatic functions such as heart rate but 
which also has been linked to emotions -- including the emotional 
response to pain -- and facial expressions.</a>

<p>
``Spindle cells were notably absent in the gibbon as well as in New <br>
World monkeys, Old World monkeys and all of the prosimians (such as 
lemurs),'' they added.

<p>
The findings show that, as biologists have long said, chimpanzees and 
bonobos are the closest relatives of humans.

<p>
``The observation that among humans and great apes, chimpanzees have <br>
spindle cell densities comparable to humans -- and it is the bonobo 
whose spindle cell distribution most closely matches that of the 
human -- underscores the relatedness of Homo (the human species) and 
Pan (the chimpanzee species),'' they wrote.

<p>
Spindle cells in this area have also been shown to be affected in 
Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, the 
researchers pointed out. This suggests that the susceptibility to 
such diseases may have evolved only recently.
