<a href="1266.html#1267qlink1">&gt; I would recommend learning Java *first*.  Java is probably the</a><br>
<i>&gt; best-designed language around right now, and the one that will start out</i><br>
<i>&gt; by teaching you the right programming ideas.  Reading a Perl book, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; paying particular attention to all the arcane features, is an excellent</i><br>
<i>&gt; introduction to Old High Hackerdom, meaning Unix and whatnot; also, Perl</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the present language of the Web - although Java servlets are coming</i><br>
<i>&gt; up fast.  If you want to write actual GUI applications, or anything fast</i><br>
<i>&gt; and smooth, there's basically no choice but to use C++.</i><br>

<p>
To make it clear which parts I *know* and which parts I *believe*:

<p>
At the dawn of time, I typed in extremely simple programs in Basic and
Logo.  At about nine, I think, I wrote a few simple programs in
Hypertalk.  I don't count any of this as "learning to program".

<p>
I learned to program in MOO (text-based virtual reality,
object-oriented, secure, interpreted, cooperative environment), and I've
got around a year of experience in that.  Then, I wrote my first GUI
program in C, because it had to run in 32K - don't do anything like this
if you can help it!  Then, I got six months worth of Java.  Then I
started on C++.  My highest level of expertise is in C++, a few years
worth; I can do the possible elegantly and the impossible via black magic.

<p>
I can do a little Javascript and CGI.
<br>
I can read programs in Perl and Common Lisp.

<p>
Haskell, BETA, APL, Eiffel, and Scheme - theoretical knowledge only, but
they're still fascinating.

<p>
The only OS I presently have any experience is the Macintosh, but I've
fallen in love with BeOS and I intend to switch over as soon as I can
back up my computer.  It's easy to see that BeOS is infinitely superior.
 I don't have any actual experience, but it's utterly obvious that BeOS
is The Right Thing, the OS I've always wished I had, and I can't wait to
get started.  (Sound irrational to you?  Take a look at BeOS.)  As far
as I know, it's the only object-oriented operating system.
