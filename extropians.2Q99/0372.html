<a href="0327.html#0372qlink1">&gt; A general-purpose nanotech fabricator, capable of </a><br>
<i>&gt; making most kinds of physical goods in a sealed environment, </i><br>
<i>&gt; is similar in complexity to an automated factory. </i><br>
<i>&gt; It still requires human supervision, but you don't need </i><br>
<i>&gt; a whole ecology of different factories to make different kinds of goods.</i><br>

<p>
Where does the sealed environment come from?  It's made in another factory,
right?  What about all the machines (including computers) in the factory
that makes sealed environments?  Where do those</a> machines come from?  

<p>
<a name="0425qlink2">Where does the building come from?  -- i.e. the building that houses the
sealed environment.  It's built by a contractor, right?</a>  The same
<a name="0425qlink3">contractor that builds all the other buildings in Silicon Valley.</a>  And what
<a name="0425qlink4">about all the machines that the contractor uses?  And so forth.  You can't
get away from the whole ecology of factories.</a>  

<p>
<a href="0327.html#0372qlink2">&gt; While many proposed nanotech goods are wildly complex, </a><br>
<i>&gt; the production of mundane goods using nanotech fabricators </i><br>
<i>&gt; need not impose much additional design cost. </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems reasonable to expect that automated software, </i><br>
<i>&gt; similar in nature to a compiler, could convert a </i><br>
<i>&gt; high-level design calling for a given part into the </i><br>
<i>&gt; low-level instructions needed to fill a given volume of space </i><br>
<i>&gt; with a regular pattern of atoms. Thus, the design problem </i><br>
<i>&gt; is not inherently harder for nanotech manufacturing.  </i><br>

<p>
Neither harder nor easier.  The difficulty of a design problem depends on
the complexity of the task, not on the size of the parts.  

<p>
<a name="0425qlink5">The matter-compiler could be simulated.  Instead of filling a volume of
space with a regular pattern of atoms, suppose you have a program that
fills a simulated space with simulated atoms, and puts the result on the
screen.  At the lowest level, you have simulated atomic</a> positioners putting
<a name="0425qlink6">simulated atoms into a pattern, and then there are higher levels where
larger systems coordinate the activities of the atomic positioners.  Then
you have the compiler that takes a high-level design and converts it into
low-level instructions.  Apparently you're a programmer, so you tell me --
<a name="0408qlink1">how complex would this simulation be?  What would it be comparable</a> to?
