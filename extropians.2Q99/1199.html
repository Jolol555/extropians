I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't develop a closed form. First,
the idea of closed form solutions was much later, the Greeks mainly
relied on geometrical construction. Second, the artisan class was
fairly divorced from the philosophers even if they did use some of the
practical results of geometry. My impression, admittedly not an expert
opinion, is that Greek architecture was very much a craft with plenty
of internal knowledge but not that much overarching theory (sorry for
the pun).
