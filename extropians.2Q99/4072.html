Of course, cloning isn't a weapon, and even if Saddam did clone
himself he would likely get more trouble than benefits from that
(given that he has killed a large part of his family to keep in power,
the last thing he would like is a number of young identical twins of
him, growing up while he gets older...). The point was really more to
suggest that medical technology can be used for 'ill' purposes, big
and small. Practically no technology is completely harmless.
