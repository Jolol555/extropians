<p>
I will be going to the Foresight group genius weekend and in consideration 
of the small space in my hotmail account, will attempt to move it to my 
nanogirl@halcyon.com. Otherwise, it will have to many collected messages in 
my box and simply delete themselves.

<p>
When my appearance of unsubscribe appears, it will be merely a change of 
email address. I would not leave such a fellowship of thought!

<p>
I'll be leaving tomarrow morning, I'm so excited I could just, well never 
mind!! The new aspect of this meeting is using the design shop method or 
grouping together, this was described in a book called Leaping the Abyss by 
Chris Peterson and Gayle Pergamit.

<p>
There is a slight chance I may be able to check out your emails over my 
absence on my (new and resourcful toy)palm pilot, but highly unlikely due to 
the big phone bill it would create. Happy trails until we meet again. 
(tuesday or wednesday)
