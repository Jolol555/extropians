<i>&gt; &gt; Yes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If the universe is not infinite, what is it that lays infinitely beyond it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I put forward that beyond our universe is absolute vacuum with no light, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; beyond that approximately infinitely more universes in various stages of</i><br>
<i>&gt; expansion and contraction.  Similarly to how we might astronomically observe</i><br>
<i>&gt; protostars forming and supernovae, perhaps somewhere right now a new universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; is experiencing its Big Bang, and another is contracting to either a super</i><br>
<i>&gt; black hole or a proto-universe to explode again.</i><br>

<p>
However, logical analysis suggests that the distance between any two universes in
the infinite vacuum would also be infinite.</a> Read and understand the following:


<OL>
<a name="0165qlink2">  <li>  The odds of a universe beginning are infinitessimally small, a finite
probability.
  <li>  The lifespan of of the average universe is also finite.


</OL>
<p>
therefore, c) follows:
<br>
c) There are a finite number of universes in existence in the true vacuum at any
given time.

<p>
If this is true, then a finite number of universes spread through infinite amount
of true vacuum makes the average distance between two universes infinite.</a>

<p>
<a name="0165qlink3">Because of this, no two unverses can collide.</a> Prof. John Cramer has suggested
<a name="0165qlink4">that it may be easier to build a wormhole between two different universes than
between two points in the same universe. Why? Because if you have two ends of a
wormhole within finite distance of each other you will generate a causal loop,
which is amplified in proportion to the amount of relativistically caused
temporal shift between the time frames of the two ends. When you have such a
shift, as has been posited for a wormhole used for time travel, you will get some
matter which goes back in time through the wormhole, then travels back to the
original mouth, and goes back in time again, etc, eventually causing so much
matter to travel in this loop that you cause the universe to implode.</a>

<a name="0165qlink5"><a href="0148.html#0152qlink2">&gt; Where two expanding universes collide, there shall be much energy.  Crossing</a><br>
<i>&gt; the barrier or region between two universes might be possible or impossible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Two universes colliding is a wave of energy from each universe colliding at</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost the speed of light.  I believe relativity holds true as we can see</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the redshift phenomenon.  There are some redshift anomalies, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence points towards the Big Bang theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Alternately, there is an ontological plane above ours where our universe is</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, similarly, all the universes in an infinity of space might simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; be an occurrence in a higher level ontological plane.</i><br>

<p>
Universes as we know them are merely aberrations in the stability of the true
vacuum. It cannot be a perfect vacuum, because perfection is unstable.</a>

<a name="0165qlink6"><a href="0148.html#0152qlink3">&gt; An approximately infinitely long time ago, prior to the Big Bang, if it</a><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would suggest the term Universe (capitalized) to represent all the</i><br>

Its called the Multiverse.
