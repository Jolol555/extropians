<a name="0984qlink1">The May issue of Esquire has a 12 page
<br>
special on the increasing likelihood of physical immortality.  It states
that a 40
<br>
year old of today has a pretty good chance of catching the wave.  The
article references Kurzweil, a few of the headline grabbing biotech
breakthroughs (including a claim of human cloning in S Korea in
December 98--familiar to anyone?) &amp; a few possible implant-type
</a>
interfaces &amp; enhancements.  It also touches on uploading, but only as a
step to being put into a new brain.  It deals wth possible social
reactions in a journal-entry story, but trots out bugaboos re:
overpopulation &amp; resource exhaustion.  There are even handy tips on how
to be part of the first immortal generation.

<p>
File this under preaching to the converted
(maybe), but the SciFi Channel has new promos showing people wanting
things like cyber/bio enhancements, uploads, nanotech &amp; self-directed
evolution.  If the memes have reached Madison Ave,
they must be near to reaching the mainstream consumer.

<p>
Reasons to be cheerful?
