<a href="1648.html#1649qlink1">&gt;Haven't seen the new Star Wars movie (The Phantom Menace) but after</a><br>
<i>&gt;reading an article on it in Time/ Newsweek/ US News &amp; World Report,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think I  will. There was a quote from the movie featured</i><br>

<p>
Just saw it.  When it ended, the audience didn't just clap, didn't just
cheer, some of them *screamed* their approval of the movie.  And happily
milled about the lobby and theatre, somewhat stunned.  Yes, it's just a
Star Wars movie, and just entertainment, and almost a children's story, but
that's the point.  Any movie critic putting this one down needs to find a
new line of work.  It paints a larger universe with more detail and beauty
than ever on film before.  And, there is a partial sci-fi explaination for
"the force" that makes it a bit more palatable to us hard sci-fi fans.
