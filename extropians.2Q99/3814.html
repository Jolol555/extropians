<p>
Maybe they could do the job, but you might be willing to pay to have a
real waiter or doctor (with AI support).

<p>
Reasonably well? What program can explain appendicitis to a child?

<p>
<a href="3786.html#3814qlink3">&gt; But somehow people don't ever think that they will be</a><br>
<i>&gt; able to *talk* to a robot or respect a robot's decisions or authority.</i><br>

<p>
I agree that this may be a mistaken attitude. But a lot of jobs will
likely for historical/cultural reasons demand at least androids. First
to get people to accept the robots, and then because it is
traditional.

<p>
<a href="3786.html#3814qlink4">&gt; However, all of that will happen because robots will eventually be able</a><br>
<i>&gt; to do things so much better than people and people will always have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; tendency and desire to refer their work to others. How will social</i><br>
<i>&gt; attitudes change? Will it only be when people start owning robots (like</i><br>
<i>&gt; that new Sony dog)? Will there be people who refuse to EVER consent to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the authority of a robot policeman? Or will it take until we have</i><br>
<i>&gt; realistic androids that are indistinguishable from humans?</i><br>

<p>
Or when they start demanding wages and argue for their freedom? Of
course, that may not be the normal robots, but somebody is bound to
build and program a freedom-seeking or independent robot if only as
art.

<p>
<a href="3786.html#3814qlink5">&gt; Here's a specific thought: imagine a robot is made to be a babysitter.</a><br>
<i>&gt; It is specialized to know how to fix meals, generally clean, tell</i><br>
<i>&gt; stories, recognize and acknowledge physical danger, get kids dressed and</i><br>
<i>&gt; change diapers, and immediately notify authorities and parents in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; case of an  emergency. In fact, it would improve babysitting because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; parents could get an immediate report at any time from their computer at</i><br>
<i>&gt; work, and look through the robot's eyes on demand. I would speculate</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a design like this is not too far off.</i><br>

<p>
So what does it do when the child demands that it play a new game,
where the rules are made up by the child? How to convince a
recalcitrant child to go to bed? Somehow I think you are a bit too
optimistic about the near term possibilities of robots - babysitting
is a highly complex interaction and not just a collection of simple
skills.
