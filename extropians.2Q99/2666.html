The oldest post I have on this particular computer in this debate indicates</a> that we
were having a rather calm discussion of property rights and natural rights when you
posted the following in response to one of my posts:

<p>
<a href="1799.html#2666qlink2">&gt; &gt; Failure to insist upon the Natural source of individual human rights is</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the loophole through which all totalitarians are able to cloud the minds</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and hearts of humanity so that the people conduct the evils crimes of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; history for their opressors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The very same tactic the Inquisitionists, Nazis and antiabortionists</i><br>
<i>&gt; use: First demonize those who disagree with you, call them villains</i><br>
<i>&gt; and consciousless subhumans; then you can feel righteous pride</i><br>
<i>&gt; when you kill them, rather than guilt or shame.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If we do not insist upon our rights'</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Natural origins, then they are in fact merely fictions which rely purely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; upon the unjustified force we wish to bring to bear to force others to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; accept our version of reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a category mistake.  You cannot use a moral argument to</i><br>
<i>&gt; decide upon the existence or nonexistence of a physical law.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Period.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I need force no one when I stand upon my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; own two feet and insist upon my natural rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nature grants no rights; People grant them to each other or take</i><br>
<i>&gt; them for themselves, or a combination of the two.  A hurricane,</i><br>
<i>&gt; lightning bolt, earthquake, tornado, tsunami or any other act of</i><br>
<i>&gt; nature cares not one whit about your assertion of "natural rights".</i><br>
<i>&gt; The two words juxtaposed form a contradiction in terms.  What is</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural is what obtains prior to any country, society, civilization, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; culture; the Darwinian Law of Survival of the Fittest For Their Niche</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the rest be damned by the scythe of Natural selection.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; "State of Nature" preceding mutually agreed upon norms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; acceptable conduct was nasty, brutish and short.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They may kill me, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they will not enslave me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You must be the kind of 2nd amendment gun nut who would dearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; love to kill all those "different' people whom you suspect of looking</i><br>
<i>&gt; at you sideways, and who fervently believes that those two</i><br>
<i>&gt; Colorado kids were a sinister Bradyite plant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You must love your freedom more than your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That, according to Hegel, was what originally separated the slave</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the master, although a fat lot of good it did the masters to</i><br>
<i>&gt; become weak incapable parasites ripe for revolution (to pursue</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hegel's master-slave dialectic further).  One who is willing to die for</i><br>
<i>&gt; his own freedom has historically also been more than willing to kill</i><br>
<i>&gt; to maintain control of of others.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Evil prospers upon the acquiescent surrender of the courage of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; individual.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It takes courage to kill other people, whether your motives are</i><br>
<i>&gt; tainted or pure, or whether your cause is just or unjust, or whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; good or evil results (three different things).  It would be nice if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; could equate evil and cowardice, but this we cannot do, for there</i><br>
<i>&gt; have always been the courageous evil and the cowardly good</i><br>
<i>&gt; among us.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Joe, how about you stop projecting the worst aspects of your personality</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; onto the rest of us? Just because you can't see someone think differently</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; without wanting to kill them doesn't mean that we can't. Indeed, us 'gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nuts' want to allow all those different people to own guns to protect</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; themselves; to a rational mind I would have thought that would rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; indicate that we're not actually intending to kill them... unlike the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; disarmers, who've been murdering 'different' people all century long.</i><br>

<i>&gt; I was tired of hearing the raving randian bastards on this list label</i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody who disagreed with the slightest scintilla of their pet</i><br>
<i>&gt; dogmas as evil vermin who should be exterminated for the greater</i><br>
<i>&gt; good, and figured they'd like a gander of getting goosed by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same slimestick themselves to see how the fuck it feels to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; slandered by association with extremists.  It's simply karmic tit-for-</i><br>
<i>&gt; tat; you don't do it to others, it doesn't get done back to you!  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's the people with the guns who are shooting everybody (always</i><br>
<i>&gt; has been); they play this little "Shane" home movie in their heads</i><br>
<i>&gt; about how they're righteous people pushed too far by bullying</i><br>
<i>&gt; cliques, and the next thing you know, fifteen kids are lying dead in</i><br>
<i>&gt; school halls, and the gun lobby steps on its dick by claiming that if</i><br>
<i>&gt; a guard had a gun he coulda stopped them when one did and</i><br>
<i>&gt; couldn't, and Li'l Einstein Danny Quayle kisses Wayne LaPierre's</i><br>
<i>&gt; ring by saying he hoped the massacre wasn't used as an excuse</i><br>
<i>&gt; to restrict gun sales!  FUCK excuses; it's a goddamned REASON!</i><br>
<i>&gt; Finally the Senate got a testicle transplant and put some</i><br>
<i>&gt; safeguards on the criminal flea market gun shows where two of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; guns were bought, and insists on safety locks so's if Junior nurses</i><br>
<i>&gt; a carelessly left automatic and plays with the trigger, he won't get</i><br>
<i>&gt; a lead lunch!  About Damned Time!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I would not call this a rational, reasonable, mainstream solution.
