Abstract
<br>
  In this report, we presented the results that EGCG, the main constituent of
  the polyphenols present in Japanese green
  tea inhibited growth of leukemic cell lines of both human
  and mice. The proliferation of human leukemic cell lines and mouse NFS60 cell
  line was inhibited by EGCG. Sensitivity of each line to EGCG was different,
  and more than 50% of DNA synthesis was reduced in all the cell lines in the
  presence of 50 microM EGCG. On the other hand, normal hematopoietic
  progenitor cells retained their natural function of supplying mature cells of
  various lineages in the presence of less than 10 microM EGCG in vitro. Even
  in the presence of 100 microM EGCG, half the colonies containing all the
  lineages of cells were developed. All the dead cells of each line showed
  characteristics of apoptosis, which might be due to inhibition by EGCG of
  growth factors' signaling. Besides anticarcinogenic activity, EGCG is
  expected to have a new function for leukemia therapy without side effects.

Abstract
<br>
  Inhibitory effects of green tea on
<br>
  carcinogenesis have been investigated in numerous laboratory studies using
  (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) or crude green
  tea extract, and there is also some epidemiologic evidence.
  Further, EGCG has been reported to inhibit the growth of cancer cells, lung
  metastasis in an animal model, and urokinase activity. In this study, we
  first examined the association between consumption of green
  tea prior to clinical cancer onset and various clinical
  parameters assessed at surgery among 472 patients with stage I, II, and III
  breast cancer. We found that increased consumption of green
  tea was closely associated with decreased numbers of
  axillary lymph node metastases among premenopausal patients with stage I and
  II breast cancer and with increased expression of progesterone receptor (PgR)
  and estrogen receptor (ER) among postmenopausal ones. Since these are
  potential prognostic factors, we then investigated the prognosis of breast
  cancer with special reference to consumption of green
  tea, in a follow-up study of these patients. We found that
  increased consumption of green tea was
  correlated with decreased recurrence of stage I and II breast cancer (P &lt;
  0.05 for crude disease-free survival); the recurrence rate was 16.7 or 24.3%
  among those consuming &gt; or = 5 cups or &lt; or = 4 cups per day, respectively,
  in a seven-year follow-up of stage I and II breast cancer, and the relative
  risk of recurrence was 0.564 (95% confidence interval, 0.350-0.911) after
  adjustment for other lifestyle factors. However, no improvement in prognosis
  was observed in stage III breast cancer. Our results indicate that increased
  consumption of green tea prior to clinical
  cancer onset is significantly associated with improved prognosis of stage I
  and II breast cancer, and this association may be related to a modifying
  effect of green tea on the clinical
<br>
  characteristics of the cancer.

Abstract
<br>
  BACKGROUND: Laboratory studies have revealed the cancer preventive effects of
  green tea, so the association between
<br>
  green tea consumption and cancer was
<br>
  examined in a human population. METHODS: The association between
  green tea consumption and cancer incidence
  was studied in our prospective cohort study of a Japanese population. We
  surveyed 8,552 individuals over 40 years of age living in a town in Saitama
  prefecture on their living habits, including daily consumption of
  green tea. During the 9 years of follow-up
  study (71,248.5 person-years), we identified a total of 384 cases of cancer
  in all sites. RESULTS: We found a negative association between
  green tea consumption and cancer incidence,
  especially among females drinking more than 10 cups a day. The slowdown in
  increase of cancer incidence with age observed among females who consumed
  more than 10 cups a day is consistent with the finding that increased
  consumption of green tea is associated with
  later onset of cancer. Age-standardized average annual incidence rate was
  significantly lower among females who consumed large amounts of
  green tea. Relative risk (RR) of cancer
  incidence was also lower among both females (RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.33-0.98)
  and males (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.39-1.21) in groups with the highest
  consumption, although the preventive effects did not achieve statistical
  significance among males, even when stratified by smoking and adjusted for
  alcohol and dietary variables. CONCLUSION: Our epidemiological study showed
  that green tea has a potentially preventive
  effect against cancer among humans.
