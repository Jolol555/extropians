<p>
On the contrary, my anti-government stance is also supported by my
argument, since it is demonstrated that "that government governs best
which governs least". The least possible government is none at all.</a> I
cannot get any more consistent than that.

Moreover, your<a name="1788qlink1"> separation of hard and soft sciences is another
<a name="1799qlink7">rhetorical wedge used to divide the houses of knowledge to serve the
purposes of the ignorant.</a> The difference between hard and soft sciences

<a name="1799qlink9">that the trend toward consilience aids</a> in. My own distain for many in
