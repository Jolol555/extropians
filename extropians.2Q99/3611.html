Why? Don't you think these people could develop an adequate support

Well, good to see that we will evolve into nice people....

<p>
Then perhaps you are not explaining yourself properly?
I tell people all the time when they are annoying me to stop, and they
do. No anger required.  In fact, getting angry at someone usually does
nothing so much as get them angry at *you* which is about as
counter-productive as you can get.


<p>
&gt; Anger is a well-developed social<br>
<a href="3520.html#3611qlink5">&gt; convention which tells other people when they've gone too far.</a><br>

<p>
Actually, I think that anger is an undeveloped form of rage, and we have
rage to get us out of situations of extreme personal danger (i.e. being
attacked by something nasty), and is hardly ever needed in normal daily
life, unless you are involved in a fight, or have managed to overturn a
car onto yourself, etc.

<p>
I don't think anger is necessary at all. 

<p>
I do pretty well without getting angry very often, and I was always told
in my martial arts training that getting angry is a no-no, as you lose
control. I have found this to be true with most people.

<p>
I think we would be far better off if there were more clear thinking and
less anger in the world, and I would expect that anyone wanting to
become something better than they are now would work on
anger-minimisation as a sensible step towards that.
