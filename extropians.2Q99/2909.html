I'm for that...ive been considering such a concept for years..

<p>
Briefly i've a hypothesis.

<p>
I use (for purposes of my own thinking) the term "cognitive dissonance".  I 
use that to mean internal meme warfare within a person'sown head.  

<p>
That is. if a person holds a belief that he KNOWS is true...and he also holds 
another beleif that he KNOWS is true..but the two beleifs contradict each 
other.  That is congnitive dissonance.  

<p>
Clinton has been said to be able to "compartmentalize".  This was supposedly 
a good thing.  I view it as a bad thing.  It deteriorate judgement and is 
irrational.  Just what we need for a world leader who has THE button.

<p>
Similarily the gun debate.  I imagine that there are levels of cognitive 
dissonace which lead to the name calling and word twisting we've witnessed 
these last few weeks..

<p>
Like i mentioned once before "Don't confuse me with facts....my mind is made 
up"....well that sums up congnitive dissonance pretty well.

<p>
Any thoughts?
