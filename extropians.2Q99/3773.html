I dont know.  Have you suggestions?  If a parent died in an accident
use their parents l.q.?  If the now-curable disease death occured when
the parent is older than the average age at which their ancestors perished
I suppose you could estimate how long they would have lived.  Obviously
this is not an exact science.  One can only... spikulate.  {8^D

<a name="3776qlink1">The original question is: suppose I wish to raise a litter of pups.
The best gift I can give them is a set of genes that will predispose
them to long life.  If I take a sperm donation from a 117 year old
man, there is much time for that DNA to have accumulated
errors.  Ova would not be available from a woman much older
than about 50.  So, how do we identify good genetic material?  Assume
I care nothing about race, height, intelligence, etc.  The goal is

How now, Dr. Bates?  spike
