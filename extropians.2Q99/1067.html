<a name="1085qlink1"><a href="1062.html#1067qlink1">&gt; I now suspect that within 20 years, *all* the information currently found</a><br>
<i>&gt; in print-only format will be no more useful in that form than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; collection of</i><br>
<i>&gt; mostly sermons in the stacks at Yale.  spike</i><br>

Although most information held within those books will be quite of little
use to most, I fear that we'll wait till it's too late. There are a whole
many books which do exist only once. If we assume that even the most
insignificant book holds at least a bit of useful information, why do we
risk the destruction of it by not replicating it's contents?
<a name="1085qlink2"><a name="1071qlink1">To me, one of the greatest disasters was the burning of the Great Library at
Alexandria. Humanity lost - in one night - the intellectual work of several
hundreds or thousands of wise men.</a> What would we know today if we had this
information?

<p>
In the medieval times, men travelled weeks or nomths to be able to read a
book, which were stored mostly in cloisters. It sometimes seems to me that
things did not change very much.<a name="1085qlink3"> The library of the Vatikan in Rome still
holds one of the most important libraries of the world.</a> Eventually, it will
burn down the same way as did Alexandria. And all will be lost, if we do not
change something in the way information is stored and processed.</a>

<p>
<a name="1085qlink4">BTW: The burning of books reminds me of Fahrenheit 451 ...
