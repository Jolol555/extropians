"... and we thank Reverend Stewart Thundran for explaining why the<br>
Bible shows blacks, asians and liberals to be inferior to us. Our next
guest here at the Annual Racist Conference is Herr Doctor Wilhelm
Zuckermann from the Transhuman Research Institute. Welcome, Herr
Doctor!"

<p>
"Thank you. It is a pleasure to be here among similar-minded<br>
people. My research clearly<a name="3208qlink1"> shows the superiority of the white race on
many measures: intelligence, certain aspects of physical stamina,
personality factors and overall attractiveness."</a>

<p>
[Shows diagrams, the audience cheers]

<p>
"However, we decided to find out what aspects of these factors were<br>
genetic and cultural. We undertook a international study, where we did
both a genome and cultural factor analysis. Eventually we arrived at
this:"

<p>
[Huge, complicated diagram]

<p>
"In short, we can see here the genetic basis for most of the inferior<br>
traits, and how the different alleles among most whites makes us
better.

<p>
We then went on to investigate what to do about it."

<p>
[cheers from the audience]

<p>
"While genetic therapy on adults is still not good enough, we think<br>
that gene therapy on the embryo stage might work. And germline
engineering certainly will. With the right viral vectors we can cure
inferior races of their genetic problems."

<p>
[the audience starts to look stunned]

<p>
"In our experiments in animal models, we have found that it is indeed<br>
possible to use 'coctail viruses' to introduce the right antisense
inhibitors and express new alleles to make an inferior strain not just
normal, but actually to *enhance* it.

<p>
It turned out that since there are also alleles with positive effects
even in a strain that is overall somewhat weaker than the normal
strain. So when all the bad genes were fixed, the overall effect was
that it became better than the normal strain"

<p>
<a name="3757qlink1">[some members of the audience begin to look worried]

<p>
"Using the technologies we have developed, it will not just become<br>
possible to cure blacks, asians and liberals, but to make them into
superior races."

<p>
[stunned silence, then pandemonium. Herr Doctor raises the volume of
his microphone and continues unfazed.]

<p>
"I see you realize the wonderful possibilities too.</a> Of course, not<br>
everything is genetic and there are cultural influences that are just
as important as genes. With increasing standards of living and
education, we can expect many of factors such as IQ differences to
even out. But there are other cultural factors that have negative
effects on people, and we have set up an applied memetics study group
to develop the means to modify culture to fix the cultural
deficiencies of inferior cultures without losing the positive elements
of them; we fully expect a similar superiority effect to occur."

<p>
<a name="3757qlink2">[Herr Doctor notices a screaming Clan member]

<p>
<a href="0742.html#3181qlink1">"But what about *us*?!!"</a><br>

<p>
"Oh, isn't that obvious. We use the same technology to improve our<br>
defective genes and memes.</a> Just as an example, given the ozon hole, it
is obvious that black skin is a big advantage we better get too. Not
to mention get rid off a lot of stupid memes like monotheism.

<p>
<a name="3757qlink3">In the long run as everybody optimizes themselves with only the best
genes and memes, of course, the end result will be just one superior
race. Any new races after that will simply be different design
choices. Isn't that great?"
