  In the 1980s, Apple Computer changed everything by employing a desktop 
metaphor on personal computers. But putting a desktop on a screen was easy — 
they’re both two-dimensional. The plan for the next user interface 
revolution is a bit more ambitious — shove an entire three-dimensional 
office onto your computer screen. There’s an army of small companies racing 
to develop 3-D access to your data. It may sound far-fetched, but thanks to 
more powerful PCs and desperate cries of information overload from the 
masses, you may find yourself swimming through your data (rather than 
sifting through it) sooner than you think.
<p>
       PERHAPS YOU REMEMBER the ethereal “Visual Thesaurus” Web page that 
whipped around the Net about 18 months ago. Engineered by New York-based 
Plumb Design Inc., the entrancing Java application let users “move” through 
synonyms, which appeared to float by like leaves on a pond.
<p>
       It was almost three-dimensional, it was very cool and it had very 
little real-life function — 3-D, after all, is only for games, isn’t it?
<p>
       There have been high-end visual data programs such as SPS for some 
time, used by sophisticated researchers. And companies such as Toronto-based 
Visible Decisions Inc. have been telling finance executives since 1993 that 
it’s easier to make tough decisions based on pictures than on numbers. But 
those applications stayed, for the most part, on high-end Unix computer 
systems in college libraries, dark research offices or high-tech trading 
desks. And visualization tools were used exclusively to analyze data — not 
to serve as a full-time user interface.

<p>
       Not anymore. There’s been a flurry of recent attempts to transform 
the Internet, and even your home computer, from lists of files and folders 
that you open and close into physical space that you move around in.
<p>
       In March, portal Excite.com launched Excite Extreme, a 
three-dimensional front end for its Web service that lets visitors float 
through main sections “My Excite,” “Channels” and “Tools.” AltaVista.com, 
owned by Compaq Computer Corp., had already been offering a visual browsing 
feature, AltaVista Discovery, since August.
<p>
       In April, that cool thesaurus found a real-life application. Plumb 
Design, which created the thesaurus with its tool Thinkmap, sold the concept 
to Sony Music. The two launched a Web site April 14 — advertising agencies 
looking to add music to a commercial now browse Sony’s 200,000-song database 
by pushing around floating words that represent various moods or song 
categories.
<p>
       And most recently, a Xerox PARC spin-off called Inxight released a 
free downloadable applet called MagniFind that lets users view their hard 
drive in three dimensions, with file folders represented as floating circles 
connected by lines.
<br>
HOW DO THEY WORK?
<p>
       Excite Extreme, the Visible Thesaurus and MagniFind have very 
different looks, but work similarly. Each requires the user to click and 
drag to move through some kind of simulated space, then click to expand a 
“tree” of some kind. They feel very much like movable, expandable family 
trees — which they are.
<p>
       “A hierarchy is a hierarchy,” said Bernstein. “There’s a number of 
ways to depict them.” Neatly nested information — that is, data that fits 
into “families” — makes for a neat hyperbolic tree. That kind of data is 
more “deep and not so wide.” But if you’re the type to have hundreds of 
files in each folder, your hyperbolic tree would need some pruning before it 
would be useful. Still, on MagniFind’s Web site, Inxight puts its front end 
on the entire Usenet. It works, but it looks mighty crowded.
<p>
       “Certain data makes sense to look at from a 3-D perspective, like the 
flow of air around a jet engine,” said Spotfire’s Ahlberg. “Other kinds of 
data look better in 2-D.”
