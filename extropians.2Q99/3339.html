Actually it may be possible.  There is a lot of research that still needs to be
done with regards to wormholes and baby universes and M-Theory is certainly
shedding insights on this matter.  Below are three references addressing this
challenge.

Travel. American Journal of Physics v56, p395 (1988)

p1116 (1990).

cosmological model. Physical Review D v39, n4 15-Feb-

According to Kip Thorne, a wormhole can be made traversible (into a baby universe)
if there is sufficient 'exotic' matter, a highly stressed matter, with enormous
tensile strengths. The tension or pressure of exotic matter exceeds the energy
density. We have no familiarity with such matter today, but it existed under
conditions of extraordinary pressure in the early universe.
