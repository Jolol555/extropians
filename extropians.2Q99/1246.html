<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>I have a
couple q's i would like to have cleared up. First off i would like to
know what is the ultimate goal of the post human form.<a name="1262qlink1"> I hear talk about
over population, econimic gitchs due to immortality, ect. It seems to me
that the whole point of becoming post-human is to break the limitaions of
human restriction; and there have been statements about future issues due
<a name="1262qlink2">to transhumanism that are already human issues right now.</a> My second q is
that of the emotion that a human experiences. What is the relevance of an
emotion in post-human form? Any info/links on emotion studys would be
</a>
great. Lastly, what are your views on the collective whole?<br>
<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>On an
aside, i must highly recommend some music due to the fact of the artists
mastery of the machine as a musical tool. Some some of the best artists
out there doing this are; Aphex Twin, Autechre, Square Pusher, Jega, and
Bola. If you wish to learn more about this music, check out
<a href="http://www.warp.net/" eudora="autourl"><font color="#0000FF"><u>www.warp.net</a></font></u>.
or contact me @ my personal e-mail (robot@neo.lrun.com) to gain access to
my mp3 site w/ 12 gigs worth of IDM (the name of the future music style).
Its great stuff.... ;) <br>
