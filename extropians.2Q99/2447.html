<p>
I've noticed that many of those engaged in the the gun debates could have
used some catchy phrases to more completely decimate their opponents'
arguments.

<p>
Here are some clever comebacks to hurl at your antagonists.  Hope they come
in handy.

<p>
Enjoy,

1.  Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique
<p>
      point of view.

<p>
2.  The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist.

<p>
3.  I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard
<p>
     to pronounce.

<p>
4.  Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.

<p>
5.  I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't care.

<p>
6.  I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid.

<p>
7.  What am I? Flypaper for freaks!?

<p>
8.  I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant.

<p>
9.  I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.


<OL>
  <li>  I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I  had about you.

  <li>  It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off.

  <li>  Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.

  <li>  No, my powers can only be used for good.

  <li>  How about never? Is never good for you?

  <li>  I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn
       to worship me.

  <li>  You sound reasonable...Time to up my medication.

  <li>  I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.

  <li>  I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message...

  <li>  I don't work here. I'm a consultant.

  <li>  Who me? I just wander from room to room.

  <li>  My toys! My toys! I can't do this job without my toys!

  <li>  It might look like I'm doing nothing, but at the cellular level
       I'm really quite busy.

  <li>  At least I have a positive attitude about my destructive habits.

  <li>  You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.

  <li>  I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself
       in public.

  <li>  Someday, we'll look back on this, laugh nervously
       and change the subject
