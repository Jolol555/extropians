You know, there are several commercials that I love just because they look so
good, and could watch time and time again. But I couldn't tell you what 
they're actually advertising, because the visuals are so compelling that
the actual 'message' is lost in the noise. In fact I've seen a couple of 
commercials lately where I couldn't even *tell* what they're advertising.

I love good commercials because they have some of the best film-making in
the world, but I really wonder sometimes whether the companies who pay
vast amounts of money for them actually think about what they're paying
for.
