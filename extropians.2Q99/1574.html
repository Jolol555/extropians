<a name="1615qlink1">You can't push atoms around, unless they are noble gases absorbed to a 
cold surface. If you had a naked atom (radical) trying to bond it to 
something would be the least of your worries. In fact this is the
reason you can't work with single atoms (with the possible exclusion 
of shooting cold radicals down a buckytube upon a surface), but have 
to use reactive moieties. They are either an analogon of a monomer, 
or get reactivated in a cycle after deposition. The abstract deposited 
species may indeed be an atom, but this doesn't mean you are pushing 
atoms around.

Yes, there is much to learn: <a href="http://crit.org/critmail/sci_nano.88-94/2279.html">http://crit.org/critmail/sci_nano.88-94/2279.html</a>
