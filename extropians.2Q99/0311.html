society. That is the inability of the average person to take FULL
responsiblity for their own health.
<br>
  Henson- an obviously intelligent and talented individual- dies from a
disease that almost always kills a person who is already debilitated. How
does such a person allow themselves to get that way? Not knowing any more
about Henson than what I saw on TV, I can still be fairly sure that he:
Choose one or more from this list-
<br>
(1) smoked tobacco
<br>
(2) ate a diet heavy on fat and sucrose and almost devoid of a long list of
ESSENTIAL vitamins and minerals
<pre>
(3) did as little physical exercise as possible
(4) consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, or coke, or reefer, etc
(5) hadn't had a complete physical in a long time
(6) ignored early symptoms of declining health
(7) then fully expected to be cured of any and all disease at his
</pre>
convienence and at resonable cost.

<p>
I'm not taking a poke at Henson. We all engage in risky behaviors and I
liked some of his work too. (KERMIT)
<br>
But don't expect your local MD to be able to cure a full blown case of
pneumonia when you wait until you are half dead before calling the office.
