<a href="0431.html#0439qlink1">&gt; So I'm still mystified by what the exciting ideas in Matrix are.</a><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe I've assimilated those ideas too deeply to notice them.</i><br>

<p>
The central idea to me was that it demonstrates that "artificial"
or "illusory" sentience is in fact real sentience.  Humans built
machines that mimicked intelligence, only to discover that their
intelligence was real and their motives were their own.  In a
proper dramatic turnabout, the artificial world these machines
then created to keep the human minds active (regardless of the
silly justification for this)<a name="0453qlink1"> itself became genuinely sentient,
and capable of its own motives.  The point was not that Neo was
in fact a body in a vat; the point was that the "simulated" Neo
was the real hero--more real in fact than the limited flesh
version.  His "escape" served only to inspire him to do his real
work of hacking from the inside.</a>
