	i guess i have no problems with insults, because rational people 
should have nothing to fear from them, and so should be able to solve 
problems while giving and recieving em right n left... (eg bustamove 4, arhat 
;) and i have reason to think that those involved in this debate are, at 
rootshell, pretty rational people.
<p>
	tech? fuck yea, tech is woderfull... and talking about it is 
neccassary. but if youve got a tool and ya dont know how best to use it, 
youve gotta problem. thus, politics.
