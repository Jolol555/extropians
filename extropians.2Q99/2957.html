Joe, thanks for the interesting question.

<p>
In response, firstly,
<br>
I think that this is blurring one very important distinction.
Seems to me that there is a difference between making a decision 
about what to do and making a decision about what 
someone else should have the option to do.

<a name="2970qlink2">Is the argument you propose above significantly different from the
following?

<p>
If we cannot be trusted to logically, rationally and reasonably decide
who is unfit to speak publicly, how can we be trusted with free speech?

</a>
<p>
Secondly,
<br>
<a name="2970qlink3">I think there is another distinction that is not being addressed.

<p>
You say that the question is:

<p>
If we cannot be trusted to logically, rationally and reasonably decide
<p>
   ^^^^
<br>
who is unfit to possess the means to committ long-range mass murder, how
can we be trusted with guns?  
<p>
              ^^^^
<br>
Rather, I think the question ought to be:

<pre>
If some external agency cannot be trusted to logically, rationally and   
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</pre>
<br>
reasonably decide who is unfit to possess the means to committ long-range
mass murder, how can 
<pre>
an individual be trusted with guns?  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</a>

</pre>
<p>
<a name="2970qlink4">Seems to me an entirely different question, even not noticing my prior
objection.

<p>
Thirdly,

<p>
Assorted objections about difficulties of getting agreement between
people, differences in opinions between expert and public opinion, and
growth of power in organizations.
