<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I've always thought that whole immaculate conception thing is</i><br>

After all, it was good enough for Zeus.

If the second coming is anything like the first go round, Jesus will be
taken away by welfare. Certainly God would lose His contact rights, and I
can't see Him claiming that he can't afford the alimony.

<p>
Does this mean that the divorce court could end up awarding Mary II half of
the universe?

<p>
I suggest to anyone who is going to be a single mother that they claim the
father is God, and maybe they can get control of half the universe anyway.

<p>
Maybe there'd be some convincing paternity test? "No, the baby never cries".
That's actually a sign of abuse though, which takes me back to my first
point.
