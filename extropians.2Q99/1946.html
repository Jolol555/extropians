<a name="1965qlink1">With your statements above and Eugene response</a> to them (no
quoted), think about it in Lem's context.  The point behind such
a device was for those who might be far away from help.  In
_Fiasco_, the person who uses the cryo unit is doing it because
he's lost and about to die.

<p>
They actually don't find him for a long time.  Even at the time of
his cryosuspension, they don't have the tech to revive him.  It's
just a gamble, but it pays off.

<p>
Now imagine you're far away from a suspension team and have
a choice between dying or being put into a clunky cryo chamber.
You might not worry as much about a lot of the damage a good
perfusion can prevent because your options are limited.

<p>
<a name="1965qlink2">Also, one could think of such a cryo unit as something which a
suspension team could talk other people through using -- people
who are on site, but don't have medical or suspension skills.</a>
That might be a different model than the self-cryosuspension
one.

<p>
<a name="1965qlink3">In regard to this, I'd like to see someone attempt just something
simple first.  Afterward, he/she/they could improve upon it, solving
the perfusion and other problems -- rather than waiting for a perfect
robot/remote suspension unit.  Chances are the latter will develop
too late for many people..</a>

Cheers!
