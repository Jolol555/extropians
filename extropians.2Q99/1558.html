<p>
A tautology is essentially a way of pointing out the obvious.  I don't
see why this is "worthless".  What is obvious to some is not obvious to
others.  In fact, I am constantly amazed at people's general lack of
awareness of obvious facts.  I have also noticed that people often
respond in anger when the obvious is pointed out to them.  I wonder if
this response explains the general lack of awareness of the obvious.</a>
