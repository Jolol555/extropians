In a relationship of this nature, one would hope the other's partner 
would be a willing participant of this sort of action also 
(cryonics). If not at least respect your choice to do so. I mean were 
talking about people who love eachother here right? On that same 
note, as for the question "would I not have the operation so my 
family could have the money or fight for my life". Hell yeah I'd 
fight for my life, and if they loved me, they would want me to. 
Better have me alive and be broke then me dead and rich.

<p>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink1">&gt;I would only suggest that you maintain a life insurance policy that </a><br>
would be
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink2">&gt;sufficient to pay for cryopreservation, keeping in mind that prices </a><br>
may
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink3">&gt;increase as different and more effective protocols are developed </a><br>
(one reason
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink4">&gt;to sign up now).  But if something happens that prevents you from </a><br>
increasing
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink5">&gt;your coverage (e.g. heart attack) then you may be stuck.  It's true </a><br>
that the
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink6">&gt;average cryonicist is older than most, but the young are poor </a><br>
planners in
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink7">&gt;general when it comes to life-long goals (e.g. insurance, </a><br>
retirement, etc).
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink8">&gt;It's just difficult for them to appreciate the need to plan on the </a><br>
next 60
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink9">&gt;years when they only have twenty under their belt.  Since you </a><br>
mention a
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink10">&gt;possible future spouse/partner and your possible desire to return to </a><br>
them,
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink11">&gt;that brings up some potentially thorny issues, doesn't it?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0657qlink2"><i>&gt;How long do you all think marriages will last in a world</a> where </i><br>
everyone is
<br>
<a name="0657qlink3"><a href="0631.html#0654qlink12">&gt;ageless.  I know I'm not going to let the preacher include,</a> "Till </a><br>
death do
<br>
<a name="0657qlink4"><a href="0631.html#0654qlink13">&gt;us part." in the vows.  I suspect that the average marriage</a> in the </a><br>
future
<br>
<a name="0657qlink5"><i>&gt;would last for a shorter period of time than it does today.</a>  To be </i><br>
blunt and
<br>
<a name="0657qlink6"><a href="0631.html#0654qlink14">&gt;insensitive, I think that many people stay in a relatively loveless</a><br>
<i>&gt;relationship as they get older because they feel there are no</a> other </i><br>
options.
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink15">&gt;Well, there'll be plenty of options if you're not aging.  Plus, time </a><br>
changes
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink16">&gt;everyone, so the more time...the more change...the further apart you </a><br>
are
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink17">&gt;likely to grow.  I don't see anything wrong with this.  When it </a><br>
comes to
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink18">&gt;*shoulds*, I only believe that couples *should* try to maintain </a><br>
respectful,
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink19">&gt;commited, and hopefully loving relationships until their children </a><br>
are grown.
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink20">&gt;Even though lots of very psychologically healthy kids have grown up </a><br>
in a
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink21">&gt;single-parent houselhold, my experience suggests that two parents </a><br>
provide
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink22">&gt;greater levels of support and stability (getting off topic, now).</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another thorny cryonics issue is the benficiary issue.  Spouses can </i><br>
easily
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink23">&gt;become upset with the idea that you've established a cryonics firm </a><br>
as the
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink24">&gt;beneficiary of your life insurance policy instead of the family.  </a><br>
Ideally,
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink25">&gt;you could maintain two policies, but what if you only had the </a><br>
resources to
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink26">&gt;maintain one policy?  Who would the beneficiary be?  OK, now </a><br>
consider this
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink27">&gt;analogy:  You've been told by your doctors that your only chance to </a><br>
live
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink28">&gt;requires an experimental medical procedure costing over $100,000 and </a><br>
with a
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink29">&gt;10% chance of success.  Would your spouse insist that you *not* have </a><br>
the
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink30">&gt;operation so that the family could have the money?  Would you agree </a><br>
or would
<br>
<a href="0631.html#0654qlink31">&gt;you fight for your life?</a><br>
