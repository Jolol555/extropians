I think that all of this business is way too thin skinned.
People disagree violently about these issues. So the discussion will be
vigorous. Get a helmet.

<p>
Think global act local.

<p>
Global - ideas are the path to the future: make sure they can flow without
restraint.

<p>
Local - filter your ideas source to maximise your velocity into the future.

<p>
We don't need no stink'in censorship - we just need to exercise our personal
right not to read.

<p>
You can't fix anything by begin dictatorial. You can't fix anything by
"silencing" alternative voices. If your only answer to people you disagree
with is to censor them - you are the enemy of the future. If you think that
you being offended is justification for a gag order on someone else, then
either you or I are on the wrong list!

<p>
And frankly, nothing is broken hear except the broken record of censorious
PC authoritarians - which my kill file has fixed nicely for me ;-)

<p>
If it becomes clear to you than some parties are not actually having a
discussion but rather have some ulterior motive (just annoying you, laying
down a hailstorm of misinformation to cause you to doubt your position while
providing no real evidence for their own position etc) ... then your answer
is simple - get a decent e-mail client and drop that subject into your kill
file. If they are clear idiots, drop them into the kill file.
