<a href="2098.html#2184qlink1">&gt; Joe, AMERICA WAS FOUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO WOULD RATHER SHOOT DISARMERS THAN</a><br>
<i>&gt;GIVE UP THEIR GUNS! And since then, the freedom-lovers of the world have</i><br>
been
<br>
<a href="2098.html#2184qlink2">&gt; leaving Europe and Asia and moving to America; the country probably has</a><br>
<i>&gt; the largest population of freedom-loving people in the world, many of whom</i><br>
<i>&gt; have previously lived in totalitarian societies which have disarmed them</i><br>
<i>&gt; in order to control them, and now you want to take away their guns. What</i><br>
<i>&gt; you think they're going to do?</i><br>


<p>
Probably spend months sulking, no?  Your caps above says it all. Are you
proud of that fact?  Yeah everyone is moving to the US because they can get
away with anything.  I've been hearing about cold hard facts. Shit, why
don't members of this list form their own paramilitary terrorist groups and
start killing innocent people?  It seems like they have the mind-frame and
sense to pull it off.<a name="2276qlink1">  A government IS required as is control, people should
determine what freedom really is.  Without some form of governmental or
legal control, the world and every country in it would destroy itself. That
is why governments exist and were formed.  If some people want to live in a
<a name="2278qlink1">world of chaos, murder and psychotic mindframes</a> than so be it. It will be
the rest of us that will walk past you when your unreasonable senses have
brought you all to shoot each other.
