Someone (I THINK it's Pirsig in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,
but I could be wrong) writes pretty much the same thing about the origin of
science among the Ionians in Pre-Socratic Ancient Greece. It was apparently
the combination of a maritime economy, the existence of a leisure class,</a> and
geographical isolations that allowed the Ionian philosophers (thales et al.)
to fisrt try to reason about the world in a matieralistic manner, rather then
attributing it all to Deity X.

<p>
Something Pirsig DEFINITELY mentions is how fragile science was after it
started. No one seems to have invented it other then the Ionians, and they
did end up losing it. It was only the Arabs keeping it long enough for
Western Europe to get back on track that allowed for the Renaissance and the
Industrial Revolution, and hence, modern western society (aka, the Age of
Wonders :)).

<p>
It's perspectives like this that make me feel a little bit better about the
Great Filter paradox. Eukaryotic cells are hard to do, and science is hard to
do. Thus we can hope that the leap form eukaryotic cells with science to
Powers is less then impossible.
