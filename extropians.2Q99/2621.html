All of the more advanced uses of Drextech will give you a serious heat 
dissipation problem.  I've seen energy dissipation figures as high as 
several hundred kilowatts per cc for the more ambitious devices (fast 
assembler systems, computers, synthetic muscles, etc.).  In particular, 
medical assembler / dissassembler systems that work significantly faster 
than normal metabolic functions are going to quickly run into problems.</a>
