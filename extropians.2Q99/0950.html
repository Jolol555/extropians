&gt; Speaking of future timelines and scenario building, we had a discussion here 
&gt; about a year ago on general scenario-building that resulted in my compilation 
&gt; of a timeline stretching from 2000 to 2015.  You can find it at:
&gt;
&gt;     <a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch2/scnrio1.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch2/scnrio1.html</a>

&gt; I have rechecked it from time to time and, while it is of course still quite 
&gt; early, I'm still pretty happy with what we came up with.

<a name="0981qlink1">I am considerably more pessimistic in the short run.  Allow me to 
counter-predict.  These are all "circa 2000", and I will predict whether
they are likely to arrive by, say, the end of 2003, four and a half years
from now.  Mostly I am only including the ones I disagree with (which is
about 90% of the predictions):</a>

<p>
None of these will happen by 2003.  Flat screens will probably still
be too expensive;</a> there will be no head mounted displays in use for
<a name="0981qlink3">consumer VR (they make people sick);</a> no retinal painters will be used in

full time network spiders for end users.  They would be too inefficient
to be useful.</a>

able to rent them while travelling, etc., but you'll have to return them)</a>

No chance.

No.

Yes, but still not at a significant level.</a>

<p>

<a name="0981qlink33">:       engineering, personnel management, finance);</a> <br>

<p>
Doubtful.

<p>
<a name="0981qlink34">:       increasing privatization of investment for retirement; electronic commerce becomes ubiquitous; <br>

<p>
No.

<p>
<a name="0981qlink40">:       continuing privatization of traditional government functions; <br>

<p>
Maybe, depending on who gets elected.  Could easily go the other way.</a>

<p>

<p>
Absolutely not.

<p>

<p>
Of course.  Plus ca change...</a>

<p>
<a name="0981qlink43">: Art and Entertainment: <br>
:       first widely-distributed virtual environments; <br>

<p>
Not in terms of VR.  Possibly as an enhanced chatroom.</a>

<p>
No.

<p>
No.

<p>

<p>
Not a significant artistic force.</a>


<p>
<a name="0981qlink47">So, what's my secret?  Why is my crystal ball better than anyone else's?
Well, I'm writing a year later than Greg was, which is pretty significant
for events "circa 2000".  But I seem to view major short-term enhancements
as being both less likely and less predictable than other people here.
It may seem curmudgeonly to say "no" when other people go out on a limb
and look for breakthroughs, but that is the safer bet.  There probably
will be surprises in the next four years, but they will surprise both
Greg and me.  And they are unlikely to significantly change society in
that time frame; there is just too much inertia.
