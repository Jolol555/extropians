<a href="1181.html#1196qlink1">&gt; &gt; Can you calculate all the included angles without your computer?</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Can you calculate them *with* your computer?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Evidently the Greeks knew how to do these stone arches.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I can state for a fact that this knowledge is not lost, only out of use due to its expense. In the late 1800's, John Rockefeller owned most of what is now Acadia National Park, on Mount Desert... ...These are some of the most beautiful stone arch bridges you can find anywhere...Mike Lorrey</i><br>

<p>
Wow thanks Mike!  I didnt know of these.  I assume the proletariate see
these
<br>
bridges today as they are in a national park?  Perhaps I shall vacation
there 
<br>
this year.  {8^D

<p>
p.s. It is still a cool challenge to try to calculate the required
included angles
<br>
on the arch stones.  Ive been toying with this on and off for weeks and
havent
<br>
yet found the closed form solution.  I could do it numerically on the
computer,
<br>
but that would be cheating.  How about one of you smart guys figure it
out. {8-]  spikus joneese
