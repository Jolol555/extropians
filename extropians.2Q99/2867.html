If you drive through Moscow today you won't fail to notice giant
poorly-insulated tubes worming their way through the city -- very much 
like a drabber version of "Brazil". Apart from substandard, leaky 
insulation, the central heating installation are often of gargantuan 
proportions, which results in in enourmous losses (&gt;&gt;50%, all paid by
the customers) due to bad suface/volume ratio of the extensive 
pipe infrastructure.

(On a more anecdotal side, undetected leaks often result in cavities, 
which on occasion have collapsed and broiled alive pedestrians while
they were walking their dogs).

In Europe the building density is much higher on the average. This is

Natural gas pipes are not particularly bulky. Your arguments are true
for coarse-grain installations, but not for fine-grained
ones. Additionally, methane burns very cleanly. If planned correctly
