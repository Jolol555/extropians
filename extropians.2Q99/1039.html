<a name="1044qlink3">BTW, this isn't just my personal opinion.  The telephone companies ran into
this issue back in the 80s when they were experimenting with analog
videophones, and it is one of the things that convinced them to drop the
idea.  They kept getting complaints from users who didn't want to be seen by
everyone they talked to, and turning off the display just made everyone
wonder what you were hiding.  At the time they couldn't come up with a good
solution to the problem.</a>
