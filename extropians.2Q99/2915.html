<i>&gt; effects that the Internet (Web, Information Superhighway, whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; form it will eventually have), in the form of what Blackmore (The Meme</i><br>
<i>&gt; Machine) calls "Horizontal Memetic Evolution", will have on society in</i><br>
<i>&gt; general, particularly on developing, precocious kids.</i><br>

<a name="2955qlink1">Being 19, I grew up with a computer in the house - we've had some kind
of Mac for as long as I can remember, and I know we had other computers
</a>
before that.  I wasn't using the Internet pre-puberty, but I might
reasonably be said to know more about the subject than anyone except
maybe an early-adopter 15-year-old...

<p>
Or as I put it:  "I grew up in Other Reality."  I've got the
"ontological reflexes".  I once tapped on an underlined and http'd Web
address, in a newspaper, and then realized the mistake only after I
wasn't transported to the address.  Or the time I dragged my finger over
an interesting paragraph in a book, then realized I couldn't copy it
when it failed to hilite...

<a href="2895.html#2915qlink2">&gt;         I think that one of the best memes that we can get out today</a><br>
<i>&gt; is the meme that Knowledge and Information are the very best thing one</i><br>
<i>&gt; can do for oneself. That meme already seems to be spreading as people</i><br>
<i>&gt; realize that 1) the world is getting increasingly complicated</i><br>

You ain't seen nothing yet.

<p>
<a href="2895.html#2915qlink3">&gt; and 2) the smart people make all the money.</a><br>

<p>
HA HA HA &lt;cough&gt; &lt;snort&gt;.  No offense.  That's true about 10% of the
time for 0.1% of the planet.

<p>
<a href="2895.html#2915qlink4">&gt;         But what will happen to the precocious kid who has the</a><br>
<i>&gt; Internet at his fingertips-- the world's biggest library, the world's</i><br>
<i>&gt; biggest thinktank, the world as his peer group?</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Consider: 25 years ago, a smart, aspiring young teen asks:</i><br>
<i>&gt;         "Dad, why don't satellites fall to the Earth?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Dad thinks for a long time and finally says: "That's a really</i><br>
<i>&gt; good question, son. I guess it must be because they go so darn fast."</i><br>
<i>&gt; And that's the end of it. The young man can go to the library or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; science teacher, (and probably would), considering that was feasible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Consider that against today when the father says "Well, *I*</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know, but we can do an Internet search and find out," and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; kid knows by the end of the evening.</i><br>

<p>
Nope.  Other people in the family ask *me* to run searches.  *I* use the
Internet reflexively; I'd never dream of asking Dad unless it was in his
specialty, and even then I'd probably run a 'Net search first.

<p>
For example, I typed your question into ask.com and got an answer
(albeit in the search results) in 15 seconds.  "End of the evening,"
hah.  Might as well use a library.

<p>
I don't think of it as "searching the 'Net".  I call it "Extended
Long-Term Memory", which I usually abbreviate to "ELTM".  Like, "I don't
know offhand; let me check eltm."

<p>
<a href="2895.html#2915qlink5">&gt;         That's possible today, but will become even more common in the</a><br>
<i>&gt; Future. I would contend that in 6-10 years there will be no one who</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't have Internet access in some way, either through Set-Top</i><br>
<i>&gt; boxes, public terminals, or ubiquitous cheap PCs (which I see as most</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely). I told my own Dad recently that in 15 years, take the average</i><br>
<i>&gt; 11-12 year old child and ask him who his 3 best friends are (his</i><br>
<i>&gt; primary peer group) and I think that it will be the odd child who</i><br>
<i>&gt; *doesn't* have a best friend whom he has never met in real life. And</i><br>
<i>&gt; what will that kind of kid (the young members of this group, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; instance) do when his peers are everyone, and everything equally? How</i><br>
<i>&gt; much would that counter early environmental factors? I think it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite a bit.</i><br>

<p>
A surprising percentage of my peer group lives in Australia...
