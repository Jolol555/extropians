<p>
This is old news to someone who grew up in "The Land of Lincoln."  It is
commonly quoted as being so, and commonly denied by historians.  The only
new information is whether there now is proof.

<p>
Thinkers, artists, mystics, scientists, explorers down through the ages have
often been gay.  I think this often released them from the typical life of
raising a family, and left them with more disposable income and no one to
pass the inheritance to.  They often build labs, founded schools, started
research projects, etc.  Gays also need to leave their mark on the work
through other means than descendants.

<p>
<a href="4304.html#4319qlink3">&gt; It would be interesting to know whether any of the various writers</a><br>

<p>
Alan M. Turing, who laid the groundwork for computer in a 1937 paper,
defined artificial intelligence in 1952, and gave us the "Turing Test" that
is often mentioned on this list.

<p>
Statistically speaking, a disproportionately high number of computer
scientists are gay.  Same for hackers.
