<a href="1610.html#1617qlink1">&gt; Excellent ideas! How about linking yourself up to "spy" satelites, so</a><br>
<i>&gt; that you can "see" anywhere that you think about (above ground). Our</i><br>
<i>&gt; vision is interpreted into a 3d model (2D+, but hey), by our brains</i><br>
<i>&gt; infering missing information from other knowledge. Why not enhance that</i><br>
<i>&gt; ability, filling in with information from satelites: the 3D image you</i><br>
<i>&gt; infer from looking at an object might be a lot more realistic, if your</i><br>
<i>&gt; inferences come from real, live data which can see the "back" of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; object at the same time that you are looking at the "front". You</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't "see" in any more detail, you'd just have a better feeling for</i><br>
<i>&gt; depth.</i><br>

<p>
Might work for landscapes and general geography, but wouldn't be
directly personally useful. I would instead go for having a number of
drone robots (gnatbots) around me, filling in details of the
surroundings. Works better indoors. 

<p>
<a href="1610.html#1617qlink2">&gt; How about a bit of group mind stuff (warning, warning) to enhance this</a><br>
<i>&gt; further: Say that you can build a GIS that contains the sum of human</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge of what the world looks like at any time. Then, if you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; connected to such a database, your vision could be filled in with data</i><br>
<i>&gt; from such a system. You might want to look through walls or not,</i><br>
<i>&gt; depending on how you feel at any time (your vision still needs to map to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the 2 and a bit D model that your mind can handle). But you could</i><br>
<i>&gt; visualise any spot on the globe, and actually "see" it. What's on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other side of the mountain? I'll just visualise it as if I was on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other side... right, its the other side of the mountain. Oh. </i><br>

<p>
Sounds like a good idea. Maybe you could have markers for uncertain or
dated images (like when playing a computer strategy game like
Civilization).

<p>
Of course, all this assumes that we can interface with the 3D model in
our brains, which is nontrivial. A near-term solution would be having
wearables allowing something similar - no direct 3D experience, but
possible to view the model.
