<i>&gt; &gt; And when exactly have any of us ever said that we'd use a gun as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; our first defence against any threat? Only a fool resorts to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; violence if they don't have to.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     Mark</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But guns imply violence, don't they?  "The willingness and ability</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to protect myself" is good diplomacy, but when someone sees or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; knows that you are carrying a firearm, they know that you represent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a physical threat.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A potential threat, yes.  A menace, probably not.  I was in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; restaurant with friends, waiting to be seated, when four tough young</i><br>
<i>&gt; men pushed their way ahead of us.  Keith mildly said, "It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; customary to give your name to the hostess and wait to be seated,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; whereupon the bravos clenched fists &amp; teeth as their leader snarled,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "What are you gonna do about it?!"  Keith's son and I backed him up,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then his wife placed her hands on her belt by her (open carry) 9mm</i><br>
<i>&gt; pistol and sweetly said, "We're just asking you to show good</i><br>
<i>&gt; manners."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The bluff and bluster went away, as did the four belligerent young</i><br>
<i>&gt; men.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Guns can do wonders for manners in the right hands, and terrors to 
innocents in the wrong ones.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2167.html#2212qlink2">&gt; &gt; If you don't have to resort to violence, then</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; there is no need to have a gun there in the first place.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The presence of the gun made resorting to violence unnecessary.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; could have gotten very ugly had Pattie not been armed.  Armed</i><br>
<i>&gt; citizens deter far more crime than they commit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I would like to believe that, but I am neither an optimist nor a 
pessimist, but strive to be a realist.  Since so much either way 
goes unreported, I can only say that not only do I not know, but I 
do not think anyone else honestly does, either.
