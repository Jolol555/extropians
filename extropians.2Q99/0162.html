Hello, Extropians :

<p>
I'm new to the list.

<p>
In reviewing some of the recent discussions, I thought
you all might be interested in the Santa Fe Chaos Conference -
brief info attached.

7th Annual Chaos in Manufacturing Conference

<p>

<p>
Seven years ago, industry visionary Richard Morley and a handful of
forward
<br>
thinkers came together at the first Chaos in Manufacturing Conference.
Today, the conference remains the premier event to examine the theory
and
<br>
practice of extending the new paradigms to the manufacturing and process
organizations.  Held near the prestigious Santa Fe Institute, the
conference presents a unique opportunity to interact with the
leaders in the field in an intimate setting.  These and other luminaries
from the manufacturing and process control world will present cutting
edge
<br>
seminars and workshops on the science of complexity, providing attendees
with new concepts, and an understanding of tools and techniques that
will
<br>
provide them and their companies with an unfair advantage to start the
next
<br>
century.

<p>
Through lectures, workshops, and informal discussion groups, the seminar
will provide attendees with insights to increase their competitive
position
<br>
and to foster career growth.  Participants will join a community of
equally
<br>
forward thinking men and women in a relaxed New Mexico setting.  The
conference is
<br>
cross-discipline, drawing on work that is being done in other fields,
allowing attendees, through intellectual stimulation and interaction, to
extract lessons that can be applied to their particular situations.

<p>
The annual Santa Fe Chaos in Manufacturing Conference is presented by R.
Morley Incorporated (RMI), a global leader in the application of
complexity
<br>
science in engineering and manufacturing.  Dick Morley,
president of RMI, revolutionized the manufacturing world in 1968 with
his
<br>
invention of the programmable logic controller and continues as a
visionary
<br>
in the fields of manufacturing, engineering, and computer design to this
day.
