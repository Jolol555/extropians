I wouldn't worry too much.  Just keep on being yourself.  I found your post
refreshing.  I found the writing honest and direct.  It is not too hard to
tick off someone especially when you are so direct.

Subject: META: What did I do wrong?


<p>
<a href="1605.html#1619qlink1">&gt; I have re-read everything I have written on this list for the past month,</a><br>
<i>&gt; and I honestly don't understand why so many of you are so upset by what I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have written.  I noticed two or three things I wrote that were meant to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be mildly offensive, but that was in response to what I viewed as extreme</i><br>
<i>&gt; and unfounded hostility towards me.  I would appreciate it if those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been offended by me would read over what I have written and let me</i><br>
<i>&gt; know what I did to upset them so much.  I have no wish to be offensive,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I am quite surprised by the reaction I am getting from many of you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I feel that I have been unjustly accused by many on this list, and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would appreciate a detailed explanation, based on what I have posted to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the list, of why so many are so upset at me.  I honestly don't know what</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am writing that has offended so many.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
