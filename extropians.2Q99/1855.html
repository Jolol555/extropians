<a href="1852.html#1855qlink1">&gt; LC&gt; I am prepared to take moral responsibility for laws</a><br>
<i>&gt; LC&gt; against violence and theft...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; JD&gt; So you oppose legislation against theft, rape, child molestation</i><br>
<i>&gt; JD&gt; and murder?...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Rational argument is easier if one has a reading comprehension level</i><br>
<i>&gt; above 3rd grade.  I suspect in your case, though, that you do in fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand what I wrote, and are employing deliberate deception</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than honestly arguing the points raised.  I will let the</i><br>
<i>&gt; readers decide which style of argument is more credible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; LC&gt; No matter how loudly I may "rave", it is still peaceful discourse</i><br>
<i>&gt; LC&gt; compared to the violence of law.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; JD&gt; But not compared to the massacres which are now routinely </i><br>
<i>&gt; JD&gt; perpetrated in our schools by those to whom we look to carry the </i><br>
<i>&gt; JD&gt; future.  How can you defend a system which allows our children to </i><br>
<i>&gt; JD&gt; fatally mass murder each other? ... [more emotional rant elided]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; More dishonest argument.  Our system certainly does not "allow"</i><br>
<i>&gt; such activity, and you have provided no rational evidence that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; even encourages it, or provided any alternative that might be better.</i><br>

Mindfully reacting to the misuse of hardware by calling for laws

misuse it (violent criminals, spouse abusers, the insane, children,

deserving of the name.

<a href="1852.html#1855qlink2">&gt;  Show me some</a><br>
<i>&gt; real thought--show me a rational argument why a particular law will</i><br>
<i>&gt; have any positive effect on the violence you see, or I will have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; choice but to oppose it, because the law itself is /known/ violence,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and to practice real violence to only speculatively reduce some</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible future violence without any evidence is morally wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="1869qlink5"><a name="1865qlink2">A blatant cop-out.  You either know, or should, that the effects of 
such measures can only be determined in practice.  Pass a law 
</a>
restricting access to firearms for the above groups of people 
coupled with universal background checks to determine if in fact 
any particular person is a member of those groups and a law 
requiring trigger locks to be sold with every firearm (so that they will 
either be harder to misuse if the locks are used or it will be easier 
to assess responsibility through neglect if they are not), and check 
in a reasonable amount of time to see if violence has indeed been 
reduced.  BTW, the economic prostitution of the political right to 
the NRA and the placement of weapons as "problem solvers" in 
movies designed to appeal to teens is not rhetoric, but fact; if you 
don't like these facts, let's work together to change them. teen

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1852.html#1855qlink4">&gt; I don't give a shit that your motives are pure (if indeed they are).</a><br>
<i>&gt; Motives don't count, results do.  If you can't show me that laws</i><br>
<i>&gt; will have actual results of reducing violence, then spare me your</i><br>
<i>&gt; tear-jerking rhetoric. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
If you can't show me without testing that the desired results (less 
kids and spouses killed) would not obtain, you are simply arguing 
that the absence of the invisible is difficult to detect.  You are 
acting just like the DEA concerning medical marijuana; first you 
say there's no evidence of a beneficial effect, then you take a 
dogmatic and self-righteous stand against the very test necessary 
to gather that evidense, not, I suspect, because you (and they) 
think it would not be forthcoming, but precisely because it WOULD 
BE.  In ther absence of the evidence whose gathering you forbid, 
your position, like solipsism, may be difficult to refute, but when 
applied to the lives of our kids, it is as morally bankrupt as 
solipsism is sterile.
