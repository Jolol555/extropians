Incorrect.  See the section on goal systems in "Coding a Transhuman AI",
or the summary in "Singularity Analysis".  (Yes, you *can't* give AIs
orders after a certain point - for technical, not logical, reasons.)</a>

Okay, now this is why everyone is shouting "Straw man!".  Drextech
assumes that the forms of matter (as opposed to matter) become
duplicable resources, and that a few new manipulations (healing a cell,
creating custom-formed diamonds, etc.) become possible.

<p>
Genie machines are unnecessary.  Knocking them down does nothing to
disprove the utopia envisioned in _Engines_.

<p>
Yes, but you can build ten million skyscrapers as easy - or as hard - as one.</a>

<p>
<a name="0491qlink3"><a href="0485.html#0489qlink4">&gt; On the other hand if you don't have to program them, then they have crossed</a><br>

<i>&gt; labor." Either the robots are automatons, in which case you have to program</i><br>
<i>&gt; them, or they are agents, in which case you have to pay them. Skyscrapers</i><br>

<i>&gt; our minds and make things happen -- or the robots will have to make the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same effort to focus _their_ minds and make things happen.</i><br>

<p>
It sounds to me like exactly the same argument would rule out the
Industrial Revolution.  You've just proved that the cost of everything
is an eternal constant.  Not only that, you've also proved that I can't
have Netscape Navigator on my desk because it took a whole company to
produce it.

<p>
Nanotechnology is a material technology that does not</a> intrinsically
require or imply intelligence enhancement; even though IE is discussed
in _Engines_ as both consequence and tool, it is not *necessary*. 
Nanotech is simply an enormously powerful tool, that can be developed
like any other tool; and used to create a Utopia or blast the planet,
more likely the latter; with or without IE.

<p>
<a name="0491qlink4"><a href="0485.html#0489qlink5">&gt; Without Genies, the ability to make things out of atoms is just an</a><br>
<i>&gt; extension of present-day technology, not dizzying at all. Molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt; manufacturing without Genies is just agribusiness.</i><br>

<p>
All material business suddenly has the same economics as information;
write it once, use it forever.  The world becomes the Internet.  That's dizzying.</a>

<p>
<a name="0491qlink5"><a href="0485.html#0489qlink6">&gt; Without Genies, there will be no sudden "assembler breakthrough." Instead</a><br>
<i>&gt; of emerging in a sudden breakthrough, nanotechnology will emerge</i><br>
<i>&gt; continuously from present-day technology, over a period of decades, step by</i><br>
<i>&gt; laborious step, each step involving an effort of concentration in a human</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind.</i><br>

<p>
Why can't we get immediate AIs who then drive all the way to
Singularity, whether we like it or not?  And why couldn't the immediate
effects of assembler technology, relatively simple apps like
ultracomputers and the Ultimate Xerox, have such vast impacts - like $3
trillion of venture capital pouring into nanotech, and the ability to
actually play around in the molecular world, and the ability to run
evolutionary computer models of assemblers, and all the applications we
couldn't anticipate in advance - compress decades into months?</a>

<p>
<a name="0491qlink6"><a href="0485.html#0489qlink7">&gt; There are no Genies and never will be. This is a logical point, not a</a><br>
<i>&gt; technical point.</i><br>

<p>
If it really is a logical point, not a technical question of AI
motivations, then you're just playing with tautologies.</a>

<p>
<a name="0491qlink7"><i>&gt; It's not a question of what can or can't be done with</i><br>
<a href="0485.html#0489qlink8">&gt; atoms, or what can or can't be done with computers. I'm not saying AI will</a><br>
<i>&gt; never exist. What I'm saying is that it doesn't matter -- any entity with</i><br>
<i>&gt; at-least-human intelligence (artificial or not) won't work for free. To the</i><br>
<i>&gt; extent that a robot makes independent decisions, it will have to be dealt</i><br>
<i>&gt; with as an entity that makes independent decisions. A group of robots that</i><br>
<i>&gt; could build a skyscraper by themselves would be indistinguishable from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; contractor, and would have to be dealt with as such.</i><br>

<p>
You are simply wrong.  Our selfishness is quite independent of our
intelligence, and in fact interferes with it; this is a technical
question of goal systems.</a>

<p>
<a href="0485.html#0489qlink9">&gt; I'm not saying that nanosystems will not exist, nor that they will not be</a><br>
<i>&gt; able to create large structures such as pipelines or skyscrapers. I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; saying that a nanosystem (or any system) capable of creating a pipeline or</i><br>
<i>&gt; skyscraper will contain many human-level intelligences, and they will not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be at your command... unless you pay them, or find some other way to</i><br>
<i>&gt; motivate them.</i><br>

<p>
If you really want to know how AI motivations work, you're going to have
to read "Coding a Transhuman AI".

<p>
Furthermore, your technical argument is simply wrong.  As technology
advances, it takes fewer and fewer humans to accomplish a given task,
yes?  From sewing to making cars, yes?  I don't see why you could have a
nanosystem capable of making the pipe that one trained human could
operate, or even, yes, one that was simply given directions and went;
or, most likely of all, an Exxon that could build a pipe for everyone in
the world.  Because, the smaller the level on which you operate, the
simpler things are; the world is composed of standardized parts.

<p>
Even a *one-man* pipemaker would require intermediate AI or advanced
crystal intelligences, but nothing smart enough to make motivations a
problem.  Of course, I could be wrong about the AI required, but then
I'm not a nanotechnologist.

<p>
Drextech doesn't require genies.  Not in part, not in whole.

<p>
That is the fundamental root, as I said, of your argument, and it's the
reason why we all use the term "straw-man".  Drextech simply doesn't
require human-equivalent AI.  That is a purely technical argument; the
only part of it which I am competent to argue is the computing problems,
such as storing information or coordinating nanobots or applying
generalized heuristics.  But I don't see why the Ultimate Xerox Machine,
working on anything that can be manufactured with modern bulk
technology, isn't possible - and that's all we really need, isn't it? 
You might not be able to Xerox a rabbit, but you could Xerox a car; a
few general repair scenarios would suffice for immortality and healing;
and that's all you need for Utopia.  And I could make molecular
computers, which is all *I* need for a Singularity.  If that's not
Drextech, what is?

<p>
As for ad hominem, when you call Drextech a "belief system" rather than
a technical argument, that's implicitly assuming that they believe
because they're irrational, not because they're right.  First disprove
_Nanosystems_.  Then talk about belief systems.
