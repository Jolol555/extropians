<a name="1164qlink1">Destruction of the library probably helped the development of scientific technological culture, because the loss of its knowledge, right or wrong, inspired generations of men to conduct original research using the scientific method to 'recover' that 'lost' knowledge.</a> As a result we have reached ever higher levels of acheivement. I think that if the library had remained, we would have developed a system which prized respect for the old knowledge over the potential of new knowledge.
