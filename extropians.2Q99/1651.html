<a name="1659qlink1">I don't think you'll need to process the data into the current spectrum.
Don't underestimate the capabilities of your brain - as you said, training
your senses helps a lot, but also, the brain changes and evolves. The more
you stress it, the better it gets. If you replace your natural eye with a
cyberware eye which has enhanced abilities like low-lite and infrared, the
brain will learn to process the new abilities. The same would be true</a> for an
<a name="1659qlink2">ear. Replace the ear with one of greater functionality and your brain will
learn to use them.</a>

<p>
<a name="1696qlink1">The human brain has already changed signifficantly since the 50s, due to
mass media and the much higher impact of information on the brain. This
resulted in a less crosslinked processing of information, but at better
speed. The main turn occurred between '72 and '75 if I remember</a> it
correctly.

<p>
You would not be able to add totally new senses like a radar to your brain -
at least, not in the near future.

<i>&gt; "The simplest case would be something like increasing your range of</i><br>
<i>&gt; hearing.  To do that you essentially have to remove all of the brain</i><br>
<i>&gt; mechanisms that handle sound processing, and replace them with an</i><br>
<i>&gt; upgraded version that can handle a</i><br>
<i>&gt; wider range of frequencies and a larger volume of data.  That's a big</i><br>
<i>&gt; job, but at least its confined to a single system."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; To increase your range of hearing, you could easily shift higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; frequencies down into the audible range with a computerized hearing aid.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The sounds could be slowed down, if desired, or listened to in slices,</i><br>
<i>&gt; with enough slices missing to that the sound is in the audible range but</i><br>
<i>&gt; also at its original speed.  One could even broadcast messages in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher frequencies of sound that others could hear, with the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; "hearing aids".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; With vision, the frequencies outside visual range could be shifted</i><br>
<i>&gt; however one wanted and overlaid on the visual range frequencies, or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; huge chunk of the EM spectrum could be compressed to fit in the visual</i><br>
<i>&gt; range. Or any number of other options.  As long as you have the equipment</i><br>
<i>&gt; to detect the frequencies and to display visual information (and some</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind of computing device), you can do this (the programming would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather simple, I think).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Although (as I have pointed out before) to take full advantage of any</i><br>
<i>&gt; sensory enhancements, one must learn to process more sensory information</i><br>
<i>&gt; per second.  I have demonstrated (to myself, anyway) that one can do this</i><br>
<i>&gt; deliberately by learning to focus more intently on the present sensory</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience.  Many others throughout history have confirmed this for</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves also.  In fact, many martial arts disciplines spend a great</i><br>
<i>&gt; deal of time on enhancing one's senses.</i><br>
