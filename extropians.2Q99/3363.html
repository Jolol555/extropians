<a name="3374qlink1"><a href="3215.html#3363qlink1">&gt; I have no formal programming training - I have a degree in worthless</a><br>
<i>&gt; Journalism and with a family I don't have time to go back to school</i><br>
<i>&gt; right now...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Any advice?  Comments?  Etc?</i><br>

Yeah, don't learn Java or C++. Object orientation may not last much longer,
so just read an entry level java book or something to familiarise yourself
with the general concepts of OO just in case. The language isn't important -
they're all very similar.
<br>
VB is definitely the way to go, along with Access and Oracle. Don't worry
about new de facto technology until it is at least on the horizon, just keep
making your $70,000 (jammy git</a> !).....
<br>
To break into the next salary level, you need to get management skills. You
won't get the real swag by programming. Look into SE management, Fred
Brooks' "Mythical Man Month" is good. Then start acting like potential
management material in front of your bosses, hoping they notice you or
something.
