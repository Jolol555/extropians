Joe, how about you stop projecting the worst aspects of your personality
onto the rest of us? Just because you can't see someone think differently
without wanting to kill them doesn't mean that we can't. Indeed, us 'gun
nuts' want to allow all those different people to own guns to protect
themselves; to a rational mind I would have thought that would rather 
indicate that we're not actually intending to kill them... unlike</a> the
disarmers, who've been murdering 'different' people all century long.
