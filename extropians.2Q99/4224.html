<a name="4255qlink1"><a name="4253qlink1"><a name="4233qlink1"><a name="4231qlink1">I've been reviewing the possible approaches to upgrading our
communication and interaction options.</a>

<p>
It would appear that the installation of an EI/extropians news
server (similar to slashdot.org) is feasible.  I am going to
undertake the setup of a test-server (perhaps einews.org,
though other suggestions should be discussed).  This appears to be
a non-trivial task since it involves setting up and testing a SQL database
server as well as a host of perl scripts, so it will not happen
overnight.</a></a>

<p>
Eugene has mentioned that there is a fundamental difference
in the operation of servers like /. (a pull model) and extropians@
<br>
(a push model).  /. has a variant which seems to allow it to<br>
operate in the intermediate (news/NNTP mode).

<p>
I believe that the architecture behind /. is flexible enough to
allow for some creative experimentation on our part.
<br>
(a) It should be possible through "User Settings" to incorporate<br>
<p>
      the mail (push) option into</a> it.
<br>
(b) Obviously some users like a news/NNTP model and this<br>
<p>
      should be supported.
<br>
(c) The "pull" model currently supported allows for some of the<br>
<pre>
      more interesting approaches such as enhanced "scoring"
      or "sorting" of messages based on such things as size,
      # of external URL's, Known "experts" "wrote" or "read" them,
      messages with the greatest reader volume, messages authored by
      people who donated the most to EI to get their messages "advertised",
      etc.

</pre>
<p>
IMHO, the real problem with the "push" model we currently have
<br>
(and the old News model) is that they lack a central database that<br>
can contain sets of heuristics (presumably selectable by the user) that
can merge the collective intelligence or opinion of the user community.]
If you have a centralized database, you can test things like Robin's
"futures" models or simple "voting" on the worth of a message.
We don't have to resort to flame wars.

<p>
<a name="4233qlink2">I believe that this is a non-trivial amount of work and would
like to establish a group of individuals who have expertise
in these areas that we might sub-allocate the development
of areas in which they have the greatest interest.  I believe
some of the skills which might be required are (a) SQL/Perl
knowledge, (b) Mail Server/MajorDomo knowledge, (c)
Indexed databases (e.g. SWISH knowledge), (d) News
servers.</a>

<p>
If you have experience/interest in these areas, please send me
your name, email address, area of interest, etc.
