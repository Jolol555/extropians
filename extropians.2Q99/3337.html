I had read a theory that eyesight is fine-tuned in mammals (including humans) via a
feedback mechanism.  As the child grows, the eyeball lengthens until it receives an
inhibiting chemical(?) signal (sorry, it's been long enough that the details are as fuzzy
now as my vision).  The signal is generated by the cells stimulated by peripheral
vision.  The theory is that those cells do not receive enough light to release this
signal (which is actually released gradually) until the eye is at the right length to
focus sufficiently on the retina.  There were some animal experiments that supported this
theory.
