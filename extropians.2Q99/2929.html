smart...(so smart it can tell us who can or can not own guns... or who</a> can or 
<a name="2948qlink2">can not make other decesions...) and that we should respect</a> it and know that 
<a name="2948qlink3">it holds our best interest at heart...</a>

According to the March 14, 1999, edition of Doug Fiedor’s newsletter Heads 
Up, the IRS publishes 480 tax forms and 280 forms to explain them, sending 
out eight billion pages of forms and instructions each year which, if laid 
end to end, would circle the earth 28 times. Nearly 300,000 trees are cut 
down each year to produce the paper on which IRS forms and instructions are 
printed. Each year, Americans devote 5.4 billion hours complying with the tax 
code, which is more time than it takes to build every car, truck and van 
produced in the United States. The cost of complying with the tax system 
totals about $200 billion annually, or $700 for every person in America. The 
corporate income tax costs the economy more in lost production than it raises 
in revenue for the Treasury. Dale Jorgenson, the chairman of the Economics 
Department at Harvard University, found that each extra dollar the government 
raises through the current system costs the economy $1.39.

<a name="2942qlink1">Doug gives details of a bill before Congress for replacing this monstrosity 
with a flat tax of 17% on all income,</a> with a family of four paying no tax on 
the first $35,400 of their income. This is from the same newsletter that was 
talking about the sellout of strategic defense technology to China a year 
before the general media picked it up.
