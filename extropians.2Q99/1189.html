Why on Earth not?  We can build as big a pile of rock as you want - you just
have to be prepared to pay for it.  By modern standards there is nothing
especially challenging about any of these 'great wonders'.  Stone
construction is a somewhat neglected art (because it isn't cost effective),
but there is nothing magical about</a> it.

&gt; We still don't know who built Stonehenge or how they transported<br>
&gt; those massive stones.<br>

<p>
<a name="1197qlink2">Actually, we know exactly how most of the famous cases were built.
Archaeologists have duplicated in great detail the methods used by Egyptians
to build the pyramids and temples.  They've also done a good job on the
methods used in Greece, England and on Easter Island.  In every case there
is no magic or advanced technology involved - just old-fashioned
craftsmanship and a massive amount of human labor.</a>

<p>
&gt; We still can't construct Crystal Skulls without tool markings.<br>

<p>
Don't be silly.  We can shape and polish just about anything to near-atomic
precision using the same techniques currently used for making telescope
mirrors.  The result will have no tool marks at all.

<p>
<a href="1185.html#1189qlink2">&gt; Hewlitt-Packard, I was told but can't verify yet, did a</a><br>
<i>&gt; rigorous analysis of the Crystal Skulls but didn't reveal</i><br>
<i>&gt; their findings. HP says this was to prevent the leaking of</i><br>
<i>&gt; trade secrets.</i><br>

<p>
Sound like conspiracy theory nonsense to me.  Didn't the Skeptical Enquirer
people debunk that whole crystal skulls thing a few years ago?

<p>
<a href="1185.html#1189qlink3">&gt; There are also pyramids in China, Mexico/Middle America,</a><br>
<i>&gt; Japan, and Sudan.</i><br>

<p>
And your point is?

<p>
<i>&gt; Easter Islands stone heads also make</i><br>
&gt; mincemeat of our preconceived notions that the ancients were<br>
&gt; technologically primitive<br>

<p>
I understand that a few years back a team of grad students, working
alongside a couple of local craftsmen, were able to quarry, work, transport
and erect another statue using nothing but hand tools and manual labor.
Easter Island is a tribute to the ability of relatively small groups of
primitive humans to accomplish impressive feats.  It is not indicative of
the presence of advanced technology.

<p>
<a href="1185.html#1189qlink4">&gt; In Egypt there are underground corridors with paintings and</a><br>
<i>&gt; bas-reliefs on the walls. No evidence of torchmarks on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ceilings.</i><br>

<p>
So?  Again, the professionals say they've got a pretty good idea how
everything in Egypt was built, and I've seen enough of the details to be
convinced.

<p>
<i>&gt; Imhotep calculated the circumference of the earth</i><br>
<i>&gt; to about 25,000 miles, pretty impressive for some primitives.</i><br>
&gt; About 1000 years before Imhotep, Berossus(if I got his name<br>
&gt; right), a Sumerian priest, did the same.<br>

<p>
Yes, and the Greeks calculated both the size of the Earth and the distance
to the Moon.  Big deal.  All you need to do that is a basic knowledge of
geometry, a good eye, and some imagination.  Again, I see this as a tribute
to the human ability to work wonders with the most feeble of tools.

<p>
<i>&gt; The Dogon tribe in</i><br>
&gt; Mali knew of the existence of Sirius A&amp;B before western<br>
&gt; astronomy did, so do the Hopi tribe in the US.<br>

<p>
Last I heard, this whole idea had been thoroughly discredited.  Do you have
new evidence?
