Anders,

<p>
<a name="0505qlink1"><a name="0504qlink1">I found it somehow hilarious visualizing in my mind one of the most 
intelligent individuals I know of playing the "Marvel Superhero's" 
role-playing game!  Even in my highschool the game was scoffed at for 
being crudely simple in design, nothing compared to "Champions" 
or "DC Hero's".  But I still loved that game!  I am to this day a 
huge Marvel and X-Men fan, and the simple game mechanics were fine</a> by 
me.
</a>

<p>
<a name="0505qlink2"><a name="0504qlink2">I remember creating my characters for my game and wishing that I 
could have personal attributes and powers like they had.  I think 
moments like those put me on the road toward extropianism.</a>  
</a>

<p>
It's cool to me that you were able to take an old game like that and 
use it in a way to put new life in it.  I bet your a fun gamemaster 
to have run a campaign.  It has been years since I played an rpg!  
The game that is very hot right now in the states is called "Rifts".  
I love to pour over the supplement books for it, soaking in the 
gorgeous artwork and beautifully designed stories and character 
classes.  Watch out for the Coalition State, I hear they are about to 
go on the march!  

<p>
<a name="0505qlink3"><a name="0504qlink3">Anyway, I want to say Anders that I love your website.  I was amazed 
my the scale and breadth of it.  Maybe if I can make it from Alaska 
to California this summer for the Extro I could actually meet you in 
person.  My ancestors on my father's side came from Sweden and 
Norway, though I don't a word in either language, take care!</a></a>
  
<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
