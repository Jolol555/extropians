 He thumbs his nose at traditional ways of financing basic scientific research.

<a name="0150qlink2"><a name="0149qlink1"> He predicts that nanotech is important enough to make the research that
the average scientist is engaged in insignificant, so people who don't
substantially adopt his viewpoint as a guide for what to research often
see his vision as a threat to their prestige or funding.</a></a>
