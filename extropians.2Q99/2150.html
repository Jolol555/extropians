But guns imply violence, don't they?  "The willingness and ability to
protect myself" is good diplomacy, but when someone sees or knows that you
are carrying a firearm, they know that you represent a physical threat.</a>  All
ability to compromise on a normal level is forfeit.  My stepfather always
told me, "If you pull a gun on someone, you better be ready to shoot them,
because otherwise, when they come down from being scared and pissing in
their pants, they're gonna get really pissed and want to kill you."  It
applies here as well.  If there is no problem, why introduce new variables
that could cause new ones.<a name="2167qlink2">  If you don't have to resort to violence, then
there is no need to have a gun there in the first place.</a>
