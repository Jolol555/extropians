        Eugene will do a great job.  I have never read a post of his which
has no basis in reason or objectivity, and his contributions to both this
list and the transhuman-tech (not to mention the initial transhumanism list
from a few years ago) have always been thought-provoking and based on facts.

<p>
        The truth of the matter is, something needs to be done.  There are
quite a few people who have only been on the list for less than a year, and
many of them find it acceptable to rant uncontrollably (and frequently)
about their half-baked opinions.  The list had exceptional signal a few
years ago, and any posts that were made were generally cognizant of the
basic tenets of extropianism.  Entropy has crept on to the list within the
past year or two, but there is no reason why it can't be brought back.  The
list is not dead.
<br>
A fair, intelligent and objective moderator --even in a passive role-- will
solve a lot of problems.  My support is behind Eugene.
