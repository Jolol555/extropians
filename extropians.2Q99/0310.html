<a name="0482qlink4">I don't have time to read the Geniebusters site; I just swooped through
chapters 18 and 19,</a> since AI is my area of primary expertise.

<p>
In chapter 18, Lyle states:
<br>
"When I say, "When will we have..." I am looking for answers that take<br>
into account the realities of writing software. What would be involved
in writing a program that serves as a coder? How would that compare with
writing Windows 2000? Would it be more complex? less? about the same? Is
anyone working on such a project?"

<p>
I refer him to "Coding a Transhuman AI".

<p>
With the background of "Coding a Transhuman AI", I strongly disagree
with chapter 19.  Since an AI is "native" to the rich domain of code in
a way that an unenhanced human never can be, I would expect even a
<br>
"coder drone", incapable of acting as architect or foreman - although I<br>
have my doubts about that paradigm - to be capable of outprogramming the
entire human race at present, and certainly of outprogramming an average
programmer dollar for dollar, no matter how expensive it was.

<p>
The vast majority of coding would occur easily, almost reflexively, and
thus very rapidly, since conscious thought is required only for a tiny
fraction.  In this sense, such an AI could be said to be a coding
<br>
"genie".  But even with domain-specific functions, it could be that<br>
coding is such a general task that a "coding drone" would be (1)
independently motivated and (2) rapidly self-enhancing to the point of
Powerdom.  I personally believe (1) and (2).

<p>
My objection to chapter 19, then, is that focusing on human-equivalent
coding ability misses the point entirely.  We should be asking about the
effect of incredibly fast but blazingly stupid coding, or of entirely
transhuman coding.
