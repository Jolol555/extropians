I think you have hit on something here. Big Brother just does not want
'little' brothers and sisters to think for themselves.

It's been illegal in just about every state I know of, probably since the
Depression when people could only travel long distances by hitchhiking or
jumping a train...can't have those rabble-rousers getting around freely,
now can we?

<p>
<a href="2315.html#2342qlink3">&gt;Where should we draw the lines of "protection"?</a><br>

<p>
At the point where it interferes with personal liberty.

<p>
The Federal government has no say in this, according to the Constitution,
but I would not put it past them to interfere. Look what happened with
medical maryjane in California...

<a name="2357qlink1">A small town down south (Georgia?) about ten or fifteen years ago passed a
law requiring all able citizens to buy and maintain a firearm - this was in
reaction to some gun legislation at the time. I don't know what ultimately
happened there, though.</a>
