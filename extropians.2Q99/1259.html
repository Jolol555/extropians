Hello, Chandra.

<p>
I would recommend learning as much as you can about all aspects of your
world.
<br>
To facilitate this process, learn to pay as more attention to everything
in your world.
<br>
Everything you do, watch carefully; you need the feedback to learn from
your actions.
<br>
Play with everything; in doing so, you learn the physical properties of
things, and you discover many new uses for things.
Pay close attention to yourself, and learn as much as you can from
yourself.
<br>
Pay close attention to other people and learn as much as you can from
them.
<br>
Remember that every experience, no matter how minute or subtle, can teach
you something, if you are alert to the experience and if you choose to
learn.
<br>
Your mind already knows how to build on itself; allow it to do so as much
as possible.
<br>
Do not accept the idea that there are limits to your potential; your
potential is unknown, and any "limits" are simply unproven conjectures.
Never stop learning and improving yourself and your situation.
Never underestimate your own intelligence and creativity; you will
surprise yourself often.
<br>
Never give up; everything you value is worth acheiving.
Do not allow others to intimidate you because you are different; in the
end everyone will be glad for your determination to do what you feel is
good.
<br>
Teach others what you know, and they will become powerful friends.
Share your value with others; you have an endless supply, and your
generous example will teach others to do the same.
Remember that your world is created largely by the choices you and others
make; learn to make more fulfilling choices and teach others to do the
same.

<p>
Never stop learning.
