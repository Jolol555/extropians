<i>&gt; Joe, you're an utter fucking hypocrite. You're arguing for laws to disarm</i><br>
<i>&gt; people, many of whom will be killed as a consequence, and you complain </i><br>
<i>&gt; that we're causing anonymous people's deaths. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
They're only identified as victims once they're SHOT, nimrod; you 
wanna know who they are?  Read Time, Newsweek, U.S News.  
Their names are plastered all over those mags.<a name="1915qlink1">  I'm arguing for laws 
to keep guns out of the hands of immature and sociopathic people, 
many of which will NOT become KILLERS as a result!  For you to 
</a>
rail against that is fucking irresponsible.
</a>
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="1920qlink4"><a href="1865.html#1911qlink4">&gt; &gt;But not compared to the massacres which are now routinely </a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;perpetrated in our schools by those to whom we look to carry the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;future.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which must contribute a whole... oh... maybe 0.1% to the US murder rate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
To some parents, its 100% of their children.  These are not 
dehumanizeable statistics (though you would dearly like to relegate 
them to that position); these were individual teenaged human 
beings, whose futures were stolen from them forever.</a>
<br>

<a name="1920qlink5"><a href="1865.html#1911qlink5">&gt; &gt;I'm a military vet, a hunter, and </a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;own five guns of my own, yet the idea of these kids killing each </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;other like they are in some crazed puter game is incomprehensible </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to me.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, you *REFUSE* to comprehend it. The answer is simple: the government</i><br>
<i>&gt; youth concentration camps are utterly fucked up, and life there for smart</i><br>
<i>&gt; kids is hell. The government has chosen to disarm teachers, </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Please tell me when and where in our history our teachers routinely 
toted guns in school.</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;so the kids</i><br>
<a name="1920qlink6"><a href="1865.html#1911qlink6">&gt; know that if they go in shooting they'll have no resistance, and the media</a><br>
<i>&gt; love to splash reports of these crimes over the front pages, so they'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; get lots of publicity. Hey, you're a smart kid, you've been shit on all</i><br>
<i>&gt; your life by stupid assholes, now you have a chance to get even and get </i><br>
<i>&gt; famous. Why not?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
It's the Shane meme in action.  One change that needs to be made 
is the institution of a zero tolerance policy nationwide concerning 
hazing, teasing, and harassment in schools.</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1865.html#1911qlink7">&gt; Only to those who prefer to push their own agenda rather than solve the</a><br>
<i>&gt; real problems find this incomprehensible. If you still do, how about you </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh, and BTW, since the media outrage against the Littleton shootings,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there have been another four or five around the world. Why aren't you</i><br>
<i>&gt; campaigning to ban media reporting, since the latest shootings almost</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly wouldn't have happened were it not for the sensationalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; news reports?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Copycats infected by the "Shane" meme, which is standard fodder 
in most movie fare.

And where the fuck did I do that, YOU GODDAMNED LIAR!?!  I 
said that I would kill anyone who tried to kill me for holding my 
opinions in America, where freedom of speech and thought are 
supposed to be basic rights. Get your fucking facts straight, you 
pompous, hemorrhoidal asshole!

<i>&gt; &gt;The insane among us are those who, for whatever sick or </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;profitteering reason, not only refuse to close the loopholes which </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;lead to such weapons possession, but who continue to either </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;stand idly by or applaud as the gun industry, to support its future </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;death to our children via the same shamelessly cynical product </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;placement ad campaigns we see employed to push tobacco.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe also said, in an earlier message:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The very same tactic the Inquisitionists, Nazis and antiabortionists </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;use: First demonize those who disagree with you, call them villains </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and consciousless subhumans; then you can feel righteous pride </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;when you kill them, rather than guilt or shame. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Pot. Kettle. Black. Feeling that righteous pride yet, Joe?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Since you LIED in the statement of your premise, your conclusion 
of contradiction is itself unsound.
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The defence rests.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<br>
Yeah, that insane need to defend a piece of metal in your fist by 
killing people with it.  Defending people isn't even an issue with you 
full-moon-howling loonies; kill 'em all, but defend the precious guns.
