One of the ways this can be handled, is to find a company that
believes in your ideas and have a general contracting arrangement
with them, with stock sharing.  I started doing this now, and it
allows me to both launch the ideas and eat better sandwiches.

<p>
Another approach is to have an umbrella company that would
launch startups and work with investors, managerial teams, 
techie pools and the idea guys.  This activity</a> is interesting
enough to attract some people.  Such groups exist, we could
create a new one.
