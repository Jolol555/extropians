I don't care who's opinion is correct, all I see is a bunch of people
yelling, everywhere I go.
<br>
Especially when you consider the fact that most of this applies to the

Why? Why do you care so much? What makes you think everyone else reading
this list cares?
<br>
Perhaps if there was a subject line of [GUNS] the rest of us could
ignore the rantings.

But a lot of people don't care.
