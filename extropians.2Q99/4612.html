<p>
Extropy Institute's fourth conference, Extro 4 -- Biotech Futures:
Challenges of LIfe Extension and Genetic Engineering, will take place on
the Kerr Campus of U.C. Berkeley, on August 7-8. I already have the highly
dependable Leigh Christian as line-producer at the event. Leigh will be in
charge of overseeing the smooth running of the event. However, we need some
more folks to help out.

<p>
For now, I know that we need at least two people to staff the registration
table. We may need more on Saturday morning and perhaps Sunday morning,
when registration is especially busy.

<p>
If you live in the area, want to attend, but cannot afford the registration
fee (or can afford it but find it worth it to trade off some attendence
flexibility for savings), please let me know. (I may pass then negotiate
with you or pass you on to Leigh.) Depending on how much time you would
spend tending the registration table and perhaps helping with other tasks,
we can arrange either a reduction in registration fees or a complete waiver.

<p>
Apart from registering conference attendees (giving out packages to those
pre-paid, making ID for new registrants, running charging, keeping records,
etc.), one or two people will be needed to be at the table for those
arriving during the day, and to sell T-shirts, back issues, etc., and to
hand out meal tickets to those not pre-arranged and pre-paid. Depending on
how many people come forward to help, you should be able to still sit in on
most of the sessions. (The registration table will be right outside the
Theatre.)

<p>
Since I am expecting to fill all 200 spaces, we will need enough people to
ensure that everything functions smoothly.

<p>
Until I find out why ExI's voicemail isn't working, please contact me by
email at &lt;max@maxmore.com&gt; or &lt;more@extropy.org&gt;

<p>
Thanks,

<p>
Max
