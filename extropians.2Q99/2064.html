The largest study done that shows evidence for gun control was a study of five hand picked
counties at different times, that demonstrated that crime went up. It was such a small
sample that in each case the increase in crime was attributable to a single individual or
gang in that jurisdiction on a continuous string of crimes. I don't recall the name of the
person who did the study, but she was the person who called Prof. Lott's study 'flawed'. I
know he mentions her in the back of his book.
