<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;working out how to keep bad people away.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Only a few big problems with that one:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1. Who decides what's 'better'?</i><br>

<p>
Well, I'd say "you do", personally.


<p>
<a href="3007.html#3141qlink2">&gt; The courts and psychiatric boards can decide who are well enough</a><br>
<i>&gt; to keep and bear (those who are never convicted of violent crimes</i><br>
<i>&gt; or judged mentally incompetent), and who we are better off kepping</i><br>
<i>&gt; guns from (those who are).</i><br>

<p>
As opposed to what I am saying in my point above: we're not adult enough
as a society to be allowed such dangerous toys (like owning a pistol or
a rifle will make it possible to overthrow the govt, hahahah)

<p>
<a href="3007.html#3141qlink3">&gt; &gt; 3. What if those 'bestial' aspects of human personality are actually vital</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    to its future development? </i><br>

<p>
I don't want to live in such a society if possible.

<p>
<a href="3006.html#3141qlink4">&gt; &gt;    I'm not terribly surprised that most transhuman</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    developments come out of a country which supports 'bestial' ideas like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    competition and self-reliance, for example.</i><br>

<p>
Sure, but where do the researchers come from? Other countries.


<p>
<a href="3007.html#3141qlink5">&gt; &gt; 4. If people become 'better' then why shouldn't they own and carry guns?</a><br>

<p>
Why should they need to threaten others to be left alone?

<p>
<a href="3007.html#3141qlink6">&gt; If they became better, why would they need them, and if they</a><br>
<i>&gt; remain vulnerable to the plagues of vilent aggressiveness and</i><br>
<i>&gt; insanity, how can we trust those who have been documented as</i><br>
<i>&gt; succumbing to same?</i><br>

<p>
Exactly.

<p>
Dwayne
