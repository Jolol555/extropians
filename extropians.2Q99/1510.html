Prison Blues

<p>
Imagine yourself in this position. To your left is a sneak thief. To your
right a brute with a rap sheet of assaults and batteries. You are
surrounded
<br>
by a sea of humanity and dotted among this crowd are burglars, gang
members,
<br>
and at least a few rapists, all of whom claim they are innocent. Some in
the
<br>
crowd are slow, even stupid. Some are bright, but unlucky. Others, a
significant number, are just poor and fall somewhere in between.

<p>
You know you have unique talents, that you are different, even special,
but
<br>
in this huge facility you are lost in the crowd. You hope a guard will
recognize your value, your worth, and bestow upon you some privilege that
will let you exercise your innate skills. But, reality sets in. They have
jobs to do, regulations to adhere to. "Get back in line," they shout.
They
<br>
cannot give you special treatment. An institution like this is not able
to
<br>
let you explore and enhance those little qualities you possess. It
doesn't
<br>
matter that exercising that special talent will help you keep your
sanity.
<br>
That's not the purpose of this government institution.

<p>
Here the goals are simple. You are separated from society, segregated
from
<br>
the outside world. You are taught to respect and fear authority. You are
trained to be a model citizen, one that snaps to attention and follows
orders without question, though the orders rarely make any sense or have
any
<br>
relation to what you are actually doing. You are here to have your
individuality washed away. You are here to learn regimentation.

<p>
The outside world beckons to you. You can see it over the walls. Freedom.
Oh, how you wish you were there. You know you could keep a job. You know
you
<br>
could do the right thing and learn the ropes quickly, if given a chance.
But, you know that chance won't come. You are here for ten years. Ten
years.
<br>
Even so, you know you're lucky, in a fashion, because you got two years
knocked off for good behavior and hard work.

<p>
Until then your days are regimented, guarded, enclosed. A monotonous tone
sounds and you go to your first work station. Another sounds, you go to
your
<br>
second, your third, and so on. Finally, that cherished tone sounds and
you
<br>
get to go to the yard and breathe fresh air and listen to the world over
the
<br>
fences and beyond the wall. Welcome to public school.

He should have referred to them as "government schools" and mentioned
that
<br>
the "guards" not only don't keep you safe from violence from your fellow
inmates, they won't let you defend yourself.

real difference 'twixt  gov't schools and gov't prisons?
