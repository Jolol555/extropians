Dear Matt,

<p>
Please circulate this web site for those of us caught up in "Postalgate,"
Clinton's latest attack upon personal privacy.

<p>
I spoke with "Joe" at Congressman Ron Paul's office this afternoon, and he
stated that the Mailbox Privacy Protection Bill has been sent to committee
for rapid consideration.  Under the 1996 Contract With America, Joe said
that in situations such as this, where an agency has passed oppressive
regulations, Congress can approve a bill in 60 days to erase those
regulations.  Given the fact there were 8,000 opposition letters and only 10
letters supporting this outrageous invasion of privacy, the people
responsible for enacting these regulations against the will of the people
should be FIRED!

<p>
Yours in Liberty,
<br>
Karen Grumm
