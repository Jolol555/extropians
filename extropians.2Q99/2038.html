<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt; My point was made from an individualistic standpoint. An individual </i><br>
<i>&gt; takes </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; action for an individual's life. Laws are not individual action, they are </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; systematic violence (as I thinkwas pointed out previously). I do agree </i><br>
<i>&gt; that </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; it is bad when the category of people you write get guns....but I </i><br>
<i>&gt; definitely </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; disagree with your methods (law).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  It needs to be done for the good of all of us and there ain't no other </i><br>
<i>&gt;  way. &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, I'm sure I don't need to mention the bells and whistles that go off </i><br>
<i>&gt; when I read or hear " good of us all" : )</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As to whether there is no other way, I'm not so sure. I haven't done a large </i><br>
<i>&gt; amount of study on the issue, so my objection to gov enforcement of such bans </i><br>
<i>&gt; basically rests on my previous post's points and a few other things that I </i><br>
<i>&gt; won't list right now (tho I suppose I will later if asked : ). But I'd like </i><br>
<i>&gt; to hear why you think there is no other way. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll confess here that I'm coming from an anarchist perspective, so you can </i><br>
<i>&gt; better iunderstand my points.</i><br>

<a name="2061qlink1">There has to be a central recordkeeping resource to ascertain 
whether or not a prospective gun purchaser is underage, mentally 
deficient and/or deranged, a spouse and/or child abuser, or a 
violent criminal, as well as penalties for breaking such laws, and 
enforcement of the penalties; otherwise they would be useless 
scraps of paper.</a>  As far as anarchy goes, postulated that you have 
<a name="2061qlink2">a society of people with private property in close proximity with 
limited resources, and your goal is to maximize the freedoms of all, 
then your standard is that all people who are capable of assuming 
responsibility for the free exercise of their choices should have all 
freedoms that all others do, and in the cases of inevitable conflict, 
these should be resolved by equal and proportional compromise.  
Right away, you need an executive or enforcement branch to keep 
bullies from illicitly imposing their wills on others, a judicial branch 
to decide what is equal and proportional in each specific case, and 
a legislative to both set general standards for the judiciary to 
interpret in specific cases, and to enact refinements and additions 
so that the laws may evolve with changing circumstances.  You will 
nweed a core document, or constitution, which clearly enumerates 
the inalienable rights to which all citizens are to be entitled,</a> 
including minorities, and you need to allow the people at large to 
monitor the fairness and competency of those holding the positions 
whose responsibility it is to legislate, enforce and judge, and to 
expel and replace them at will; a popular vote.
