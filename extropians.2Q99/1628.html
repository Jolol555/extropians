<a name="1634qlink1">I agree.  I think Anders was on to something with his "picotech processors
living on a neutron star" idea.  Creating a density regime in which it is
possible for subatomic particles to form compact structures</a> with the same
<a name="1634qlink2">range of complexity exhibited by normal matter is probably a very delicate
process, but it seems reasonable to think that it could be done in
principle.  That being the case, we should expect than any posthuman society
would either graduate to pico-scale engineering in short order or invent
something so much better as to make it superfluous.</a>
