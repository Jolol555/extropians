<p>
These first three sound like you are saying that it is impossible to
effectively enforce a PPA anti-trust metalaw.  If so, this is clearly
the most important point to discuss more.    If you grant enforcement,
then by assumption monopolies &amp; malicious oligopolies are not a problem.

<p>
It would seem a straightforward to sign up for backup PPAs, so one is
always covered.</a>

Is this the same sense that a patient is at the mercy of a doctor?</a>

<p>
This is a more serious objection in my view.  But noting how people
want simplicity is often a major argument for nationalizing industries.</a>
Those pushing to nationalize health care, for example, talk a lot about
how unreasonable it is to expect people to learn enough to know which
health plan to choose.  And how much it troubles consumers to have to try.

<p>
<a name="0202qlink6">If people really really like simplicity enough, most all PPAs may end
up enforcing the same law.  But that same law might be better.  And
enforcement styles and quality could still vary widely.
