Cooling is not a problem (could be as simple as intubation), 
perfusion is. Without advanced surgical robotics (which a) isn't there 
b) is going to be expensive for a long while once it arrives) there is 
no way how you could do it.

This is not going to be an issue for a long, long time.

External cooling is not exactly efficient. You need liquid ventilation 
and/or peritoneal lavage to go down real quick. Combined with the
proper IV drug cocktail, you can postpone the washout for quite a long 
time.

"and looks really neat". I just love that sentence!
