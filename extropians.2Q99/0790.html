I'm not sure; at least on average here in the West people seem to like
a balanced family. But there are likely subgroups that will bias
things locally.

<a name="0791qlink1">Even more interesting is non-traditional forms of reproduction, such
as in vitro gestation and male pregnancies. They could help erode even
more of the old assumptions (if they ever get popular).</a>

<p>
<a name="0791qlink2">The downside is that we are the weaker sex; I'm not sure about the
perturbation thing (never seen any data on it), but we have a higher
mortality due to what appears to be a slightly less robust
construction. That is why you find plenty of old widows but few old
widowers.</a>
