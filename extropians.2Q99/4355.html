<p>
A somewhat tangential thought, is what does this mean for people who lose
their "sense of x" as a result of damage, disease, or at birth?  A person
blind from birth will never have a sense of "redness" and a person who
loses their sight early in life loses it as well.  Nonetheless, I don't
think this is synonymous with loss of consciousness.  In the pathological
cases, there are people who undergo severe sensory loss and consequent loss
of qualia with time, without any externally obvious change in their
consciousness.  I am not sure the two are separable in theory.

<p>
Or are we arguing the distinction between having the capability of qualia
and no possibility of such altogether (vs. two qualia capable systems, one
with qualia and one without)?  To argue from a capability standpoint would
seem to require a causal basis.

<p>
I actually find this to be very plausible.  As has been pointed out, there
is no way for an external observer to tell the difference between a person
and a zombie.

<p>
Intuitively, if a zombie is indistinguishable from a person, then
consciousness must collapse to something computable.

This stuff makes my brain hurt...
