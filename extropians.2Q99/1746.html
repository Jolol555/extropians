<a name="1750qlink1">Now I understand what Mike Lorrey is so upset about.  I believe that the 
concept of "Property Rights" is a fictional concept, more of a social 
convention than something that exists whether we like it or not.  Mike 
Lorrey believes that Property Rights exist whether we like it or not because 
of Natural Law.  Because our difference of opinion, he considers me "evil" 
and seeks to demonize my opinions and get me to stop discussing them on this 
list as quickly as possible.  Sounds like a good basis for a rational 
discussion...


<p>
     Related Philosophical Discusion:
<br>
As far as I can tell, all my concepts about the world are "fictional", in 
the sense that I made them up as a convenient way of organizing my 
experiences.  I believe all concepts are essentially fictional for the same 
</a>
reason.  We just made them up.  Yes, they are convenient and they do help us 
acheive goals, but they are essentially mind tricks.  Believing in one's own 
concepts too firmly is a form of delusional thinking (believing that one's 
ideas about the world are more real than the world itself).  My basic 
reality is one of experience, not of concepts (actually, concepts are a form 
of mental experience to me).


<p>
I assert that the concept of property rights is a fictional concept, and I 
have backed up my assertion with the argument that all concepts are 
essentially fictional.  I ask those who believe it is not a fictional 
concept to back up their positions, and since the position is that "Property 
Rights" exists independently of human thought, they must cite emperical 
evidence which supports the existence of "Property Rights".  In other words, 
what evidence can we see around us that demonstrates that "Property Rights" 
exists?

<p>
I say "Property Rights" is a social convention, Mike Lorrey says it is 
Natural Law.  I would appreciate it if Mike Lorrey would explain the concept 
of "Natural Law" to us, so we are clear on his meaning.  However, I suspect 
it is essentially another fictional concept which Mike Lorrey finds 
convenient to justify his political views.  Perhaps he can convince me 
otherwise. (and then I can have his "evil" label removed from me)

Thank you for your attention,
