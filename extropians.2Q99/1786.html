<p>
I see you have never read the constitution of the Iroquois
Confederation, which predates european settlement, and which explicitly
recognises property rights.

<a href="1758.html#1786qlink2">&gt; We Americans have been brought up in a culture where public education uses</a><br>

<i>&gt; murder.</i><br>

<p>
While the revisionist socialists exaggerate by far the differential in
military capacity between european infantry and natives to make the
europeans look ever the bully.

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="1758.html#1786qlink3">&gt; The treaties of which you speak were drawn up by the europeans and employed</a><br>
<i>&gt; to give documentary legitimacy to territorial acquistion accomplished</i><br>
<i>&gt; through the use of superior military technology.  The documents thus signed</i><br>
<i>&gt; were little understood by the defeated parties and, in any event, were</i><br>
<i>&gt; signed under conditions of the most extreme duress imaginable.  These facts</i><br>
<i>&gt; are more applicable to subjects such as corrupt historical scholorship, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; brutality of realpolitik, and the morally perverse employment of legalistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; instrumentalities, than to any discussion of legal legitimacy and property</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights.  Bad form that, at best.</i><br>

<p>
On the contrary, a bow and arrow was a far superior weapon to the brown
bess musket (or any muzzle loading gun) during the colonial period, and
on frequent occasions, native americans owned superior firearms in a
face off with US military, because of the slowness with which the
military procurement process worked. Custer's last stand, for example,
occured because the natives were armed with lever action repeating
rifles, while the cavalry was armed with muzzel loading horse pistols
and single shot bolt action rifles.

<p>
Natives usually never had any opposition to signing treaties. What they
objected to was the continuous violation of those treaties by white
settlers. When they did object to treaties it was because of this lack
of credibility of the whites. The US Cavalry was originally set up in
the western territories to enforce the treaties upon both the natives
and the white settlers. 

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="1758.html#1786qlink4">&gt; (In the new Star Wars movie the evil-emperor-to-be tells his military</a><br>
<i>&gt; proxies to proceed with the invasion. When challenged about the legality of</i><br>
<i>&gt; this course of action he says, "I will make it legal."  Whereupon he</i><br>
<i>&gt; instructs the proxies to capture the queen and force her to sign a treaty.)</i><br>

<p>
Speaking of currupt historical scholarship. Using the plot of a science
fiction movie written by liberal revisionists from Hollywood in an
argument on past history is the height of corrupt scholarship.
