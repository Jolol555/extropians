<a name="3240qlink1">This list used to be a place for people who agreed with the Extropian 
Principles and had read at least a large fraction of the reading list to 
talk about stuff that interested them; since those two requirements pretty
much ensured an individualist, pro-freedom viewpoint, these kind of 
political discussions didn't really come up. It's only with the 'outreach'
attempts of the last couple of years that it's been flooded by people who
don't fit into that category, and become just another transhuman list.
