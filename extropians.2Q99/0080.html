<a name="0223qlink1">Thanks to Robin and other participants for a stimulating, non-acrimonious
subject of discourse.</a> :) Comments follow.

<p>
<a href="0078.html#0080qlink1">&gt; &gt;I would suspect that medical care that really makes a difference probably gets</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to almost anybody.  Added money would mostly go to optional or speculative</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;treatment; that might well not improve mortality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But maybe most treatment is optional or speculative.  If so, maybe we could</i><br>
<i>&gt; spend 1/3 what we do now and be just as healthy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;It's implausible that the medicine we get (as opposed to additional treatment</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;we don't normally get) doesn't help.  People get things like appendicitis,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;pneumonia in the young, and gangrene which were major risks in the past</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;but &gt;very rarely die of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sure we are lots healthier now than in the past.  The question is how much</i><br>
<i>&gt; credit medicine deserves for that.  Lots of other things have changed besides</i><br>
<i>&gt; medicine.</i><br>

<a name="0133qlink1">I think there's a key point here. Consider: 

<p>
Hereabouts, "medicine" is not solely the province of doctors. Many things
are available *over the counter*, *in the water supply* and so forth
today. 

<p>
The triple antibiotic (which, when I dispose of it, contributes to MRSA
:\) and Band-Aids (tm) I can buy in the pharmacy without ever seeing an MD
can keep a heel blister from becoming infected and killing me (as happened
to one of Woodrow Wilson's sons after a tennis game). 

<p>
Chlorinated water, for all its potential low-level biohazard, and other
standard public health measures, again make a difference to me day to day
without my going to a clinic. 

<p>
These thing synergize with the fact that I'm (and many people in the
developed nations are) to some degree my own doctor for routine matters.

<p>
Plus I'm affluent enough and my bosses are considerate enough to give me a
day or more off if I come down with something. I'm not</a> a subsistence
farmer who has to keep plowing my rocky fields in the rain while fighting 
off hostile enteric parasites.

<p>
My apologies if all this was already obvious to others.
