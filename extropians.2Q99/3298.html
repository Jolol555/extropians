<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Emlyn O'Regan, &lt;Emlyn.ORegan@actew.com.au&gt;, writes, regarding Smolin's</i><br>
<i>&gt; baby universe theory:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If this mechanism of creating new universes exists, you would imagine</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sufficiently advanced civilisation/intelligence could trigger it -</i><br>
<i>&gt; create</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; new black holes, manipulate existing ones, whatever.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If that is the case, and it's not cataclysmically dangerous to do so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (relative to the necessary level of technology required), and given that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; civilisations/intelligences who get far enough to be able to do such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would probably have the drive to attempt it for the sake of doing, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have the result that universes which successfully develop advanced</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; intelligent life can spawn new universes which are copies of themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Their motivations in doing this (rather than other things they could do</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the resources) seem a bit abstract.  From what I understand, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not possible to move into the newly created universe.  (You may be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to get some information into it, but it is limited.)  So this would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a purely altruistic gesture, creating what they hope are new universes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; ones which are forever independent of their own, and in which life might</i><br>
<i>&gt; someday evolve.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Who can guess at the motivations of a civilisation which can do this? Hands
up extropians, if you had the power to spawn a new universe, and it cost you
comparatively little (what's a galaxy to me? Chicken feed...) then would you
do it?

<p>
Also, I'd be loathe to say, for someone who could create a new universe in
this manner, that travelling to it would be impossible. Beyond the
singularity, and all that.

<p>
Maybe there would be some other good reason to do this for sufficiently
advanced beings. Who can guess at their motivations? (When I get there, I'll
time travel back and post the answers to the list, maybe next week some
time, just look for messages from transemlyn@hotmail.com, or maybe I'll let
me use my current e-mail account).

<p>
On a tangent, I hope me from the future doesn't come back and kill me now,
just to explore some advanced theory of paradoxes that future me is
interested in. Eeek!

<p>
<a href="3016.html#3298qlink2">&gt; The problem is that they have to destroy resources in their own universe</a><br>
<i>&gt; to do this, shoving useful matter and energy down the throat of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; black hole.  Not to mention the cost of moving stars around or whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; is necessary to create them.  It's not going to be easy, so this is far</i><br>
<i>&gt; from a cost free endeavor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I think if it is a difficult and costly endeavour at some point, then
eventually it becomes cheap and easy. Once it was difficult and costly to
cross the ocean. Or run a computer program.

<p>
<a href="3098.html#3298qlink3">&gt; No doubt some people would be interested in doing this, but it is</a><br>
<i>&gt; questionable whether it can rival natural processes in terms of creating</i><br>
<i>&gt; black holes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hal</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I'm not thinking that it would replace the more "natural" method, but
enhance it - intelligence enhancing survival on the scale of universes. If
you're thinking in the timeframe of universe life-cycles then it could
actually be quite common. It doesn't have to happen too often either; I
think that the required replacement rate to keep a universes' heredity
continuing would be rather low.
