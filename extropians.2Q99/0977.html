On the Brain of a Scientist: Albert Einstein" was published in 1985 in =
the journal Experimental Neurology (vol. 88, pages 198-204, 1985) and =
written by Marian C. Diamond, Arnold B. Scheibel, Greer M. Murphy and =
...Thomas Harvey!

<p>
Compared to the brains of the 11 normal men, the ratios of neurons to =
glial cells in Einstein=92s brain were smaller in all 4 areas studied. =
However, when the numbers were examined more closely with statistics, =
only 1 area showed a difference - the ratio in the left area 39. So in =
the left area 39, Einstein=92s brain had fewer neurons to glial cells =
than the normal brains. In other words, there were more glial cells for =
every neuron in Einstein=92s brain.
<br>
The authors concluded that the greater number of glial cells per neuron =
might indicate the neurons in Einstein=92s brain had an increased =
"metabolic need" - they needed and used more energy. In this way, =
perhaps Einstein had better thinking abilities and conceptual skills.=20

<p>
A second paper describing Einstein's brain was published in 1996. =
Einstein's brain weighed only 1,230 grams which is far less than the =
average adult male brain (about 1,400 grams). The authors also reported =
that the thickness of Einstein's cerebral cortex (area 9) was thinner =
than that of five control brains. However, the DENSITY of neurons in =
Einstein's brain was greater. In other words, Einstein was able to pack =
more neurons in a given area of cortex.=20
The importance of these differences is still unknown. There are still =
many questions about how the brain constructs personality, builds =
intelligence and forms creativity. Perhaps future studies of the brains =
of other geniuses will reveal what makes these people such giants.=20

<p>
Diamond MC, Scheibel AB, Murphy GM Jr, Harvey T
Neuron:glial ratios were determined in specific regions of Albert =
Einstein's cerebral cortex to compare with samples from 11 human male =
cortices. Cell counts were made on either 6- or 20-micron sections from =
areas 9 and 39 from each hemisphere. All sections were stained with the =
Kluver-Barrera stain to differentiate neurons from glia, both astrocytes =
and oligodendrocytes. Cell counts were made under oil immersion from the =
crown of the gyrus to the white matter by following a red line drawn on =
the coverslip. The average number of neurons and glial cells was =
determined per microscopic field. The results of the analysis suggest =
that in left area 39, the neuronal: glial ratio for the Einstein brain =
is significantly smaller than the mean for the control population (t =3D =
2.62, df 9, p less than 0.05, two-tailed). Einstein's brain did not =
differ significantly in the neuronal:glial ratio from the controls in =
any of the other three areas studied.=20
