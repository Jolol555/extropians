<i>&gt; &gt; demand for guns they could not legally purchase resulted in a black market being</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; supplied by the Chicago cops(!).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; There is an article in the July issue of Playboy about a squad of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Chicago cops masquerading as bikers and gang members and</i><br>
<i>&gt; asking to buy guns with which to commit crimes.  The firearms</i><br>
<i>&gt; dealers were most helpful, and in just two months, the police had</i><br>
<i>&gt; purchased 171 weapons for $65,000, all for the explicit purpose of</i><br>
<i>&gt; aiding in the commission of criminal acts.</i><br>

<p>
I very much doubt that the gun shop owners knew that it was the explicit purpose. The fact
is that even the ATF is prosecuting the corrupt police of Chicago for the gun running they
have been doing on a regular basis since their boy Daley took over as Mayor.

<p>
<i>&gt; One particularly</i><br>
<a name="3275qlink2"><a name="3106qlink2"><a href="2978.html#3066qlink2">&gt; enterprizing gun shop, nestled in the midst of a suburb with a</a><br>
<i>&gt; population of 14,000 souls, sold 6500 weapons which were</i><br>
<i>&gt; subsequently confiscated by Chicago police after being used in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; commission of crimes.</i><br>

<p>
Where are all of Illinois' vaunted and celebrated gun control laws? Illinois is one of the
hardest states to buy a gun in. This only proves the adage that when guns are outlawed only
outlaws have guns. (oh, yeah, and cops too, which is apparently about the same thing in
Chicago anyways.)</a></a>

<i>&gt; about 96%) were murders.</i><br>

<p>
You fail to mention that 90% of all of these murders were actually one criminal shooting
another criminal. I don't count that as unjustified at all, no, it is a public service.</a></a>
