That's a freedom most can do without, and that can only be 
exercised once and with heavy legal consequence.  It does not 
matter.  The dead are still dead, and the most grisly revenge 
execution will neither resurrect his victims nor deter the killers of 
future ones.  Just tell me that Harris and Klebold feared the death 
penalty.

Are the ones around the irresponsible and homicidal gunman who 
can lose their lives without their knowledge or consent and are in 
actual danger of doing so free at all, or merely unaware that they 
are even less than slaves, but sheep in the slaughtering pen?  I, for 
one, do not want to live under that kind of slavery, the slavery of 
random violence, any more than necessary, and consider the 
denial of gun purchase, possession or ownersip to violent 
criminals, the mentally deficient and/or deranged, spouse and/or 
child abusers, and children to be a rational and reasonable 
measure to take in order to limit the exposure of the general 
citizenry to such a threat.
