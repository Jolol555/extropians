<i>&gt; Why does the fed gov't push for new laws when it doesn't enforce the ones it</i><br>
<i>&gt; already has?</i><br>

<i>&gt; Gun Groups Press For Enforcement</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By SALLY BUZBEE / Associated Press Writer</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gun murders in Richmond, Va., fell by 41 percent after</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosecutors there started an effort to put any felon caught carrying a gun in</i><br>
<i>&gt; prison for five years.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So why doesn' t the Clinton administration follow that model nationwide, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; National Rifle Association and other gun control opponents want to know. Federal</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosecutors could crack down on gun crime by enforcing the laws already on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; books, rather than pushing for new ones, they say.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As Congress debates a slate of gun control proposals that gained support from</i><br>
<i>&gt; lawmakers after the Littleton, Colo., high school shootings, the question of</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether the federal government does enough to enforce those existing laws has</i><br>
<i>&gt; re-emerged as a key dispute. Republicans were expected to grill Clinton</i><br>
<i>&gt; administration officials on the issue at a hearing today.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; " You can talk about the culture of violence for the next 10 years. Unless you</i><br>
<i>&gt; start prosecution, you' re never going to cut the culture of violence, " said Glen</i><br>
<i>&gt; Caroline, director of the NRA' s grassroots division.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Since President Clinton took office, federal prosecutions of gun-related crimes</i><br>
<i>&gt; have dropped more than 40 percent, the NRA says. The nation has a zero-tolerance</i><br>
<i>&gt; policy against young people bringing guns to school, for example, yet the federal</i><br>
<i>&gt; government prosecuted just eight children for that in the last two years, says</i><br>
<i>&gt; James Baker, the group' s chief lobbyist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  But the Clinton administration says gun groups use the wrong statistics, looking</i><br>
<i>&gt; only at the drop in prosecutions since 1992, when violent crime overall and thus</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosecutions began to drop after historic highs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Gun groups also ignore the recent federal efforts to work with local police to</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent illegal gun sales, and to go after those who commit crimes with guns and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the dealers who illegally supply them, the administration says.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; " It is disingenuous for them to criticize when they are looking at the wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt; numbers," said Justice Department spokesman Brian Steel, who says federal, state</i><br>
<i>&gt; and local prosecutions combined are on the increase.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  In addition, federal laws often are meant more to prevent gun violence -- by</i><br>
<i>&gt; keeping felons from buying guns, for example -- than as tools for prosecutors. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Brady Law' s instant background checks have prevented 250, 000 felons from buying</i><br>
<i>&gt; guns, Steel says.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And some crimes, such as those by teen-agers and children, are simply better</i><br>
<i>&gt; handled by local authorities, said Attorney General Janet Reno, herself a former</i><br>
<i>&gt; state attorney from Dade County, Fla. Nevertheless, officials do plan to review "</i><br>
<i>&gt; just what needs to be done with state and local authorities to ensure the</i><br>
<i>&gt; appropriate prosecution of these cases, " she said last week.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even gun-control advocates, however, say more could be done. The Bureau of Alcohol,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tobacco and Firearms should be more aggressive in putting out of business any</i><br>
<i>&gt; licensed gun dealer who breaks federal rules, says Douglas Weil, research director</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The program begun in Richmond, called Project Exile and praised by the NRA in</i><br>
<i>&gt; newspaper ads and before Congress, has dominated much of the debate. Rochester,</i><br>
<i>&gt; N.Y., also has signed on.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Clinton praised the program in a March radio address with Richmond' s police chief</i><br>
<i>&gt; at his side, but the NRA complains that the Clinton administration isn' t providing</i><br>
<i>&gt; money to duplicate the effort nationwide.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; " We want to give cities the flexibility to do whatever works in their community, "</i><br>
<i>&gt; Steel said. " Richmond had a particular problem with convicted felons getting guns.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Boston had a problem with gangs. They used different strategies, and they both had</i><br>
<i>&gt; success."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Indeed, the Boston program that started in 1995, tracing where young criminals got</i><br>
<i>&gt; their guns, became a precursor of the ATF effort to trace guns used in juvenile</i><br>
<i>&gt; crime -- a program Clinton is expanding.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  A bill the Senate passed last week includes a measure that would revoke gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; ownership rights for anyone convicted as a juvenile of a firearms crime, would</i><br>
<i>&gt; institute new background checks at gun shows and pawn shops and would require that</i><br>
<i>&gt; safety devices be sold with all new handguns. The House is expected to take up</i><br>
<i>&gt; similar proposals in mid-June.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yet even as lawmakers consider such new restrictions, some insist the focus should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be on enforcement, perhaps by giving more money to police and to federal</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosecutors or to gun-safety education programs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; " To really maximize our impact ... we' ve got to prosecute the laws we' ve got, "</i><br>
<i>&gt; said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Let's both prosecute our present laws and pass these proposed 
ones.
