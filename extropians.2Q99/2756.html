A fun application of Drextech somebody once proposed was to have a sort of
reserve
<br>
oxygen supply. The notion was to have diamond or otherwise tough little
pressure
<br>
vessels somewhat smaller than blood cells containing compressed oxygen. At
need,
<br>
determined by a sensor, a valve would open and reoxygenate the blood.  They
also
<br>
proposed using the release of pressure to store power for the later
recharging of the
<br>
pressure vessel.

<p>
My thought was that you could use something like this as a miniature
endothermic
<br>
generator, or at least as a heat sink for your ATP driven whatevers.
