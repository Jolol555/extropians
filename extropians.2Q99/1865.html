Yet it won't work. Even the Dumbocrats have admitted that their new laws
would have done nothing to stop the school shootings. The list of laws the
killers at Littleton broke is two or three pages long: why would another
one make any difference?</a>

<p>
Indeed; DC has pretty much banned gun ownership for decades now, and has
one of the highest murder rates in the world. Numerous countries have
banned guns 'to reduce crime'... it's never worked. Why should this time
be any different?</a>

<p>
Joe, you're an utter fucking hypocrite. You're arguing for laws to disarm
people, many of whom will be killed as a consequence, and you complain 
that we're causing anonymous people's deaths.</a> 

<p>
<a name="1911qlink4"><a href="1850.html#1865qlink4">&gt;But not compared to the massacres which are now routinely </a><br>

<p>
Which must contribute a whole... oh... maybe 0.1% to the US murder rate.</a>

<p>
No, you *REFUSE* to comprehend it. The answer is simple: the government
youth concentration camps are utterly fucked up, and life there for smart
kids is hell. The government has chosen to disarm teachers,</a> so the kids
<a name="1911qlink6">know that if they go in shooting they'll have no resistance, and the media
love to splash reports of these crimes over the front pages, so they'll
get lots of publicity. Hey, you're a smart kid, you've been shit on all
your life by stupid assholes, now you have a chance to get even and get 
famous. Why not?</a>

<p>
<a name="1911qlink7">Only to those who prefer to push their own agenda rather than solve the
real problems find this incomprehensible. If you still do, how about you 
go and read: <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/99/04/25/1438249.shtml">http://slashdot.org/articles/99/04/25/1438249.shtml</a>.

<p>
Oh, and BTW, since the media outrage against the Littleton shootings,
there have been another four or five around the world. Why aren't you
campaigning to ban media reporting, since the latest shootings almost
certainly wouldn't have happened were it not for the sensationalist
news reports?

<a name="1911qlink8">After pointing out that he would kill those who opposed his laws,</a> Joe
said:

<a name="1911qlink9"><a href="1850.html#1865qlink6">&gt;The insane among us are those who, for whatever sick or </a><br>

<i>&gt;death to our children via the same shamelessly cynical product </i><br>
<i>&gt;placement ad campaigns we see employed to push tobacco.</i><br>

<p>
Joe also said, in an earlier message:
<br>
<a href="1799.html#1865qlink7">&gt;The very same tactic the Inquisitionists, Nazis and antiabortionists </a><br>
<i>&gt;use: First demonize those who disagree with you, call them villains </i><br>

<i>&gt;when you kill them, rather than guilt or shame. </i><br>

<p>
Pot. Kettle. Black. Feeling that righteous pride yet, Joe?</a>

<p>
The defence rests.
