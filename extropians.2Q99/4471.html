 Thank you for your clear statement of the 2 points of
view. 

<p>
To say what has doubtless been said already (sorry)-

<p>
IMHO your stream of consciousness is YOUR stream of
consciousness, if a copy is made there are 2 streams
and the survival of a copy is NOT a substitute for
the subjective survival of the original.

<p>
 As for observers, how are they ever going to know
what the inner experience of original or copy really
is? I don't think Turing tests ad infinitum will
suffice. Again it comes  back to whether a
non-conscious "zombie" could simulate consciousness. 

<p>
I suppose I don't place that much value in public
opinion :)

<p>
I suppose experimenters could only know by a wholesale
uploading of the experimental subject into their own
brains, and then where is the experimenter?


<p>
<a href="4340.html#4471qlink2">&gt; survive.  All existing copies of me would want to</a><br>
<i>&gt; survive.  The above</i><br>
<i>&gt; scenario is only helpful because there is always</i><br>
<i>&gt; only one copy of me at any</i><br>
<i>&gt; time.  If a second copy is created, each one of them</i><br>
<i>&gt; would want to survive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; --</i><br>

<p>
Therefore killing *any* of them is murder, by my idea
of a humane standard. If you believe an upload is
conscious you can't treat either upload or original as
non-human.
