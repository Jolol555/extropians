<a href="4426.html#4431qlink1">&gt; &gt;Don't take it as an insult. Men in general will not admit it in public,</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;especially, I predict, American men, but women are on the whole perceived as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;annoyingly superficial with a one-track "social probe" masquerading as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mind. The guy that said "you don't count" was probably referring to the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that you seem more intelligent and insightful than women usually are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="4454qlink1"><i>&gt; Mr. Harris, you might consider apologizing for this rude and thoughtless</i><br>
<i>&gt; commentary.  This type of generalization is shallow and archaic.  Perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "American" men you associate with are hear about are baboons, but men</i><br>
<i>&gt; in general have higher standards of thought and perception than to be mired</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the back hills of illiteracy and social stupidity.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4654qlink2">Don't you dare apologize, Mr. Harris.  While I and many other more
rational men have a great respect for the minds and talents of women,
the attitude you describe /does/ exist, and your simple, honest
reporting of that fact is far more likely to lead to solutions than
is Natasha's misplaced indignation.</a></a>

<p>
There is a problem in our culture (though probably less in ours than
in most others, especially in recent years) that traits like competence
and ambition aren't seen as "feminine".  This is a bad thing, and
should be addressed.  Role models are a good start: Madonna comes to
mind as someone who changed a lot of attitudes for the better.  Let's
hope many more come along.
