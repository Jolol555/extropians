<a name="3659qlink1">I agree that there seems little possibility that this message is going
to stop being sent.  It has been almost a week now.

<p>
At first I tried sending mail to postmaster@gondwanaland.com.  However
whois on gondwanaland.com reveals:

<p>
   Domain Name: GONDWANALAND.COM

<p>
   Administrative Contact:
<pre>
      Linksvayer, Mike  (ML229)  ml@AU.COM
      (415) 431-0775
   Technical Contact, Zone Contact:
      Administrator, Domain  (DA550)  domain@PAIR.COM
      1 412 681 6932 (FAX) 1 412 681 6945
   Billing Contact:
      Linksvayer, Mike  (ML229)  ml@AU.COM
      (415) 431-0775

</pre>
<p>
So Mike himself is the owner of the domain, and from what he says I gather
that he is convinced that the mail is not originating from his machine.

<p>
pair.com appears to be serving as the ISP and presumably the mail
forwarder for Mike.  I checked their web page and they provide a variety
of web hosting services.  My guess is that they are responsible for the
bounces.  I sent mail today to postmaster, support, and abuse @pair.</a>com
asking them to look into the problem, so hopefully they will do something
about it.

<p>
If this fails I believe we should begin telephoning the contact numbers
at pair.com to try to get their attention.

<p>
Mike, can you confirm that pair.com is/was your mail relay and that they
are the likely culprit?

<p>
<a name="3798qlink1">One problem in terms of tracking this problem down is that our list
software does not include the mail headers for incoming mail.  My mail
arrives looking like:

<pre>
Delivered-To: hal@rain.org
Received: from maxwell.kumo.com (maxwell.kumo.com [198.161.199.205])
        by coyote.rain.org (Postfix) with ESMTP id B08916174F
        for &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;; Fri, 11 Jun 1999 00:37:18 -0700 (PDT)
Received: (from majordom@localhost)
        by maxwell.kumo.com (8.9.1/8.9.1) id BAA28888
        for extropians-outgoing; Fri, 11 Jun 1999 01:36:13 -0600
</pre>
X-Envelope-To: extropians@extropy.com

<p>
The very first Received line is the first step in the outgoing mail path
from the local machine the list runs on.  There is no indication of
where the mail came from before then.  Perhaps the list managers might
be able to manually inspect these incoming messages and determine where
they are coming from.
