It is a good point that we have a somewhat narrow perspective here and
it is easy to make the mistake of assuming that other people think like
we do.

However I suspect that in fact at least some white racists would be
willing to concede Asian and perhaps Jewish superiority (of course
Jews are white, but white racists hate them anyway), at least in
terms of intelligence.  For that matter they will say that blacks are
superior physically.  Sometimes their viewpoint is that "we whites need
to protect our own", and that Asians and Jews are even more of a threat
due to their superior intellect.  I think I have seen references to
white militia literature which takes this position.
