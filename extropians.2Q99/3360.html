<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's the Star Belly Sneech story.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; One of my favorites. To me it illustrated how stupid the whole race/difference</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; thing is...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Actually, it's stories like this that are stupid; they support the myth that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the whole "race/difference thing" is just a matter of some irrelevant </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; exterior features </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know about Dr Seuss (BTW, thanks everybody for explaining the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reference to me), but in my story (if Dr Zuckermann was right) there</i><br>
<i>&gt; were real differences. But technology can make these differences</i><br>
<i>&gt; irrelevant or even useful. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="3479qlink1">True. The question is: will that technology ever become evenly 
destributed? Note that while giving everyone an equal opportunity
is fine, it would of course be *very* stupid to intentionally make
some other race "superior". The same goes for artificial "races",
(i.e. AIs) of course.</a>

<p>
<a href="3352.html#3360qlink2">&gt; Then of course we can start arguing about</a><br>
<i>&gt; how large the differences are in real life and if they are truly</i><br>
<i>&gt; relevant compared to other factors;  </i><br>

<p>
<a name="3494qlink1"><a name="3409qlink1">Well, IMO it's all a matter of percentages; only a relatively small
portion of a race/group is responsible for its success/progress etc,
and for some reason this group has been marginalized in places
like Africa, while in Europe they managed to create a positive
feedback loop which allowed more and more people to realize
their "full" potential, thus fuelling further progress.</a> So what is the key
ingredient here?
