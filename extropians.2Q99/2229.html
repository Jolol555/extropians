<p>
We could also just enforce the existing laws. Theft is illegal already, as
is supplying a gun to a convicted felon, etc, etc. The black market is
already here - in Chicago a police officer was recently indicted for
gunrunning to the gangs.

<p>
I am quite pessimistic on this - having witnessed the many slippery slopes
we have slid down in the past, I expect this newest bout of 'gun control'
to be no different. No individual can do anything about it that would be
productive, but possibly enough of us together can. That's why I support
the Libertarian party. At least I am trying to change things from within
the system. I also have joined the NRA and the Illinois Rifle Association,
primarily to get a better deel for what the true 'gun nuts' are doing, and
to register my support for SOME of their programs.

<p>
I do not agree with all the NRA's positions, but like the Libertarians,
they stand for many of my own ideals.
