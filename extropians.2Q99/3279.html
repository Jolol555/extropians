Yep - I cheated and asked someone, although whether that is cheating is
debatable, because the knowledge is assumed - anyway, someone who *knew*
would have answered faster...

In my experience (as a human), IQ does not correlate very well to
competence. I get good scores because I am good at tests, I know plenty of
people who are REAL smart, yet score very badly. If my IQ was assessed via a
continual assessment regime, I'd probably still be a couple of standard
deviations out, just the other direction (do you get 0 IQ for not handing in
your IQ assignment?)
