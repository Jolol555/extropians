Ok, my mistake.

Probably, but not certainly.

Ok.  My contention is that the insights of people like Socrates, Plato and especially Aristotle helped shaped the entire western point of view.  Have we really exceeded it?  Most people I know refuse to see outside of the box that Western thinking defines itself as.  I believe that if were not for some incredibly brilliant modern brains like Reimann, Godel, Einstien, Hiesenberg, Schrodinger, Feynman, etc., we might still be stuck in that box.

My contention is that since a very large amount of manuscripts were lost it is possible there might have been other thinkers equal or greater in intelligence and insigt than Aristotle. Imagine the possibilities!

Yes, but the unfortuante side of that coin, is much of this computerized knowledge is also being lost in many ways.  Much of the computer data stored on Magnetic Tape, 8 and 12 inch floppies is already lost.  CD ROM's supposedly only hold their data integretiy for a decade or so.  Perhaps optical crystal holographic storage is the answer?

(Sorry if I flamed earlier, when I write at work my style tends to be more antagonsitic due to my current set of work associates.)
