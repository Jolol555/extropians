<a href="3220.html#3291qlink1">&gt; &gt; If you can't show any intellectual integrity or honesty, please stop debating. For that matter,</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; where are all the manslaughters???? If you don't include those important deaths, what is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; purpose of your statistics unless they are outright lies? A homicide is not a murder, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; justified homicide is not a negligent homicide, which is also missing. Also keep in mind that</i><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt; &gt; many jurisdictions do not call self defense a justifiable reason to kill someone, there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thousands of abused wives in prison for 'murdering' their abusive spouses.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The average murderer only serves 7 years.  But then you look at some of the people who get life in</i><br>
<i>&gt; prison-no possibility of parole, and you find cases where respectable men ended up resorting to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; use of violence after the police refused to do anything.  Men who act out of the desire to protect</i><br>
<i>&gt; their wives and children.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The hostility of government officials towards the idea of people being allowed to protect themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; is quite clear.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Your desire to rhetorically scapegoat the government for all your 
personal dissatisfactions and all society's imperfections is clearer.
