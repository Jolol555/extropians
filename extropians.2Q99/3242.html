I remember this happening.  The guy was dressed outlandishly because it was
Halloween and he was on his way to a Halloween costume party when his car
broke down.  It also was during a pretty bad storm, and it was not clear if
the student couldn't hear the warnings or couldn't understand the English.
He did not try to get in the back door, as I recall.  He merely didn't go
away, but continued to knock on the door after the homeowner told him to go
away, speaking through the door without answering.  There was no threatening
behavior on the part of the student, but the court ruled that the homeowner
perceived a threat and shot him without malice.

Scot
<br>
<a href="3225.html#3242qlink7">&gt; who got shot in Houston under the circumstances you describe. -- The</a><br>
Japanese
<br>
<a href="3225.html#3242qlink8">&gt; kid in Louisiana never went around to the back of the shooter's house.</a><br>
The
<br>
<a href="3225.html#3242qlink9">&gt; Scot here in Houston did and apparently seemed pretty threatening.  From</a><br>
the
<br>
<a href="3225.html#3242qlink10">&gt; accounts I've read, the kid in Louisiana didn't seem to have been acting</a><br>
in a
<br>
<a href="3225.html#3242qlink11">&gt; particularly threatening way -- although he WAS in a Halloween costume.</a><br>
