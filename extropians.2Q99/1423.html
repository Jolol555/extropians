I know nothing about the quality of the philosophy programs, so I'll restrict 
myself to the areas.

<p>
Davis is a small university city in farming country.  It's quieter, and 
cheaper, but it get cold in the winter and hot in the summer.

<p>
UCLA is smack in the middle of the hippest parts of LA.  It's expensive, 
crowded, and has lots of traffic, but there's a lot to do and it almost 
doesn't have weather.

<p>
FWIW, I interviewed at the biology department at UCLA in March.  They put on 
a great show, making UCLA look like it guaranteed a career and was a lot of 
fun for graduate students.  Several grad students told me "It's not just a 
show, it really is a lot of fun here.  That's why I've been hare seven years 
and I'm not done yet"  :-)
