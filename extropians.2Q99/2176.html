 Getting sentimentally reminiscent on me?  It won't happen here, 
 because our government is built to prevent it (at least since 
 Roosevelt).  If we can kick Dick Nixon out, no one can stay beyond 
 eight years, and the US is like a battleship; it turns slowly, so no 
 one could throw the populace in camps before the honcho had to 
 leave (besides, who would guard us all?).  There's something called 
 balance of powers here, too, involving an independent congress and 
 Judiciary, I believe... &gt;&gt;

the US may be like a battleship, battleships *do* turn around, even if</a> it 
takes longer than other ships (esp when you assuage fears of the "slippery 
slope" the whole way round)
