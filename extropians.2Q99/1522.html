Little green mice that are a glowing tribute to science
Daily Mail

<p>
SCIENTISTS have created green mice using a revolutionary new genetic 
engineering technique revealed yesterday.

<p>
The mice developed their unusual colour after a fluorescent gene taken from 
jellyfish was injected into their cells. When illuminated by ultraviolet 
light, scientists found that the creatures glowed green.

<p>
The green gene, however, was merely a marker. It was being used to 
demonstrate that a new technique using sperm cells to transfer genetic 
material worked.

<p>
It proved that scientists at the University of Hawaii had created a simpler 
and more straightforward method, which was reported yesterday in the journal 
Science, than the one previously used.

<p>
Usually when scientists want to modify an animal they inject DNA into the 
nucleus of a fertilised egg cell, which then develops into an embryo 
containing the new gene.

<p>
The method works well in mice but is more difficult in larger mammals such 
as cows and pigs. Their fertilised egg cells are opaque, making the nucleus 
harder to find.

<p>
The new technique, however, involves a form of in-vitro fertilisation.

<p>
In it, sperm heads whose cell coats have been disrupted by freezing or 
treating with chemicals are mixed with DNA.

<p>
That mixture is then injected into an unfertilised egg cell using an IVF 
technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection.

<p>
Some of the DNA penetrates the sperm heads, which fertilise the egg and 
consequently incorporate the new genetic material.

<p>
'The great thing about this method is that it is very straightforward. It 
may prove to be more efficient,' said Professor Tony Perry, one of the 
research team.

<p>
The technique could have major implications for the use of mouse models to 
study human genes and the breeding of genetically engineered pigs whose 
organs can be transplanted into humans.
