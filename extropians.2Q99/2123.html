Not really; gun ownership doesn't deter crime if people can't carry those
guns with them. Crooks may decide not to break into people's houses 
because they might be armed, but that's not really a problem since they
can just wait until their victims are out on the streets and disarmed</a> by 
law.

<p>
According to that DoJ report I posted a URL for, in some areas (assault 
and property crimes) it has much higher crime levels than America; this 
is probably one reason why the anti-gunners stick to murder rates. It's
possible the DoJ are fudging the figures to make America look better, but 
they appear to have gone to some trouble to get accurate statistics by
looking both at official police reports and victim surveys... and they
would seem to have a vested interest in making it look worse to get more
funding.
