Another important consideration in developing more advanced educational
approaches is creating an environment which promotes learning.  I've been
renting a small studio apartment for the past year, and my goal with the
place has been to create a rich and stimulating environment for myself to
learn quickly in.  I have several areas for working on projects, lots of
arts and crafts supplies and other basic supplies and tools.  All my
tools and supplies are very accessable, so when I get the inspiration for
a project, I can set to work immediately.  The walls have lots of intense
and interesting images on them, and I have lots of interesting objects to
look at and handle around the place, which keep my mind occupied even
while sitting, doing nothing.  Of course, I also have a stereo system, a
television, VCR, cable and a Nintendo 64.  I have mounted several eye
hooks in strategic places high on the walls and into the ceiling, which
has allowed me to do all kinds of things, such as hanging a hammock up
<br>
(just a blanket, tied at opposite corners), and I often hang wooden<br>
dowels from the ceiling which will support my weight, so I do pull-ups
and gymnastic types of exersize.  There is enough floor space to do all
kinds of exercise, like dancing and martial-arts practice.  The kitchen
allows me to learn cooking skills.  
	
<p>
Basically, I have found that I rarely get bored in my small apartment. 
There seems to be no end to the activities I can do there.  I do a lot of
drawing.  I make a lot of geometric models and art.  I work on
body-control exercises, like dancing, martial-arts and gymnastics.  I sit
and think a lot.  I write.  I cook.  I watch educational shows on
television.  I read.  I play challenging video games.  It's all a lot of
fun, and I feel like I am very productive and always learning lots every
day.

<p>
Another important point to make is that the lifestyle I've been living
for the past few years has been very inexpensive.  My base living
expenses have been around $600 a month, and I feel that I live quite
comfortably.  The sort of education I've been pursuing for myself does
not cost a lot, and I have not had to worry about getting jobs that pay
me lots of money.  I tend to use my jobs as educational experiences also.
 For the past few years, I've changed jobs about every six months, giving
myself experience in many different types of work, so that now I have
incredible job security; I can work just about anywhere in any city. 

<p>
My point is that advanced education doesn't have to cost much; actually,
I haven't noticed that it has to cost any more than it costs to live. 
It's how you spend your time that makes the difference.  It's not
necessary (or advisable, in my opinion) to go to a college or university
and pay thousands of dollars so that people can assign you to do work
that you'd rather not do simply to get the social approval of a degree. 
I personally cannot stand college.  I tried it for a while after having
pursued my own sort of education for a few years, but because of all the
assignments I was required to do, I was not able to learn nearly as
quickly as I do when left to my own devices.  Basically, I felt that
school was interfering with my education, so I quit.

<p>
The sort of education which I practice and promote is one that is
diverse, intense, self-directed and inexpensive.  In other postings, I
will describe more the techniques and approaches I use when I learn. 
Hopefully many will find them useful.
