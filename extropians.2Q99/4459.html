<p>
This is an unusual perspective and not intuitively obvious.  Are there
examples of innovations which have been shoehorned into an inherently
unnatural form for the sake of familiarity?  Maybe things like the
mouse-and-windows computer interface?  Although you could argue that
the old command lines were more familiar to typewriter users...</a>

According to the figures I found at

<a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/0898nip3/tab2b.htm">http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/0898nip3/tab2b.htm</a>, U.S. GDP has doubled
from 1969-1995.  Much of this four-fold growth must have occured outside
the U.S. and so would not be visible to readers in that country (or
presumably in other industrialized countries assuming they had similar
<a name="4492qlink2">growth rates).  Probably in third world countries the changes since 1969

are more obvious.
