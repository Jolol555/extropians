Exactly what I am working towards, but a solution determined by 
logic, reason and rationality, not absolutist and apocalyptic 
slippery-slope-domino-substitute-the-straw-man rhetoric, veiled or 
unveiled threats of list removal by people who have lied about your 
statements, or other logically fallacious and intimidatory devices.
