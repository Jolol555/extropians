Here is a speculation: in the next 50-100 yrs, the average 7th</a> Day Adventist
<a name="3540qlink9">will become darker skinned.  This will cause the much advertised
life span bonus to shrink, compared to the average population, and may
eventually even go negative.

<p>
We speculated here once that there is a worship gene, and that it is
evidently inherited.  I speculate that this gene is stronger in those
populations that are shorter lived.

Please, no racist flame wars.  I want *everyone* to live long and prosper.
My intent is to inform, not to inflame.  spike
