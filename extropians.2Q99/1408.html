From: "Billy Brown" &lt;bbrown@conemsco.com&gt;

<p>
<a href="1384.html#1408qlink1">&gt;Actually, it is just the opposite.  It is a recognition of the</a><br>
<i>&gt;fact that people in the rest of the world have their own cultures,</i><br>
<i>&gt;philosophies and opinions about how things should be done.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt;aren't going to turn their lives upside down just because the</i><br>
<i>&gt;American government (or the Europeans, or the UN) wants them to.</i><br>

<p>
Actually I worded this poorly, it was the opinion you were
responding to I was addressing. I agree with your point as stated
above.

<p>
<a href="1384.html#1408qlink2">&gt;If you believe, for example, that the destruction of the Brazilian</a><br>
<i>&gt;rain forest is evil and stupid, it does no good to rail against it</i><br>
<i>&gt;to an audience of Americans.  There is precious little we can do</i><br>
<i>&gt;about it without resorting to a massive application of force.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;people you need to convince live in Brazil, and that is where you</i><br>
<i>&gt;need to concentrate your efforts.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1413qlink1">Here we are fighting over harvesting the last of the old growth
timber in the U.S., but telling the Brazillian's they must not
harvest all of their's. If I was them, I'd tell us to F*** off.</a>


<p>
<a name="1417qlink1"><a href="1384.html#1408qlink3">&gt;You should also recognize that the situation calls for more than</a><br>
<i>&gt;just proselytizing.  Most of the environmental degradation in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Third World is not caused by evil western corporations trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt;get rich on the backs of the poor.  Instead, it is caused by huge</i><br>
<i>&gt;numbers of impoverished people trying to survive as best they can. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Telling them to stop will do no good - they aren't going to let</i><br>
<i>&gt;their children go hungry to preserve a few more acres of forest. </i><br>
<i>&gt;What you need to do is give them an alternative way of providing</i><br>
<i>&gt;for themselves that doesn't destroy the land.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1413qlink2">I don't agree, much of the degradation is related to more advanced
economies utilizing the people and resources of the third world for
their own gain, plus since we don't utilize
environmental/ecological technologies, we're the last one's who
should tell anyone about it. Fortunately South America has an
excellent example of it's own.... Gaviotas.</a></a>

<p>
<a href="1384.html#1408qlink4">&gt;Of course, trying to actually do something effective about the</a><br>
<i>&gt;situation leads to a whole nest of practical problems, but that is</i><br>
<i>&gt;a different issue.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1413qlink3">Agreed, I'm just one of those silly people who's headed for the
stars, and who want's to leave a trail and the ability to follow to
anyone interested.</a>   ;)
