After viewing the Stealing Time special, it became obvious to
me the importance of choosing the right ancestors. {8^D

<p>
I've an idea.  Calculate your longevity quotient thus:  Take
the average of the age of death of your parents.

<p>
If your parents are alive, take the average of their parents
at death.  If one parent lives, average their parents age
at death with the age at death of the nonliving parent.
If your grandparents are alive (good for you!) then continue
on up the line, averaging the age at death of their parents,
and so on.  This exercise should leave you with one
number.

<p>
Refinement:  If an ancestor perished in an accident, use
for their l.q. the average of their parents ages at death.
Expiring during childbirth could be considered an accident.
If a living ancestor is already older than the age of death
average of their parents, use their current age, or estimate
how long you think they will go.

<p>
If an ancestor was a smoker all their adult lives, add 10%
to estimate how long they would have lived otherwise.
If they smoked half their adult lives, add 5%.  If *you* smoke,
quit.  And subtract 10% from your l.q.  {8^D

<p>
I calculated mine and came up with 81.  Did anyone hit 85?
90?  If so, would you be willing to be a sperm donor
or egg donor?  (Hypothetical question).  spike
