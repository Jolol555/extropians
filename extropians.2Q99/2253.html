<p>
If anybody find anything decent there, _please_ let me know.

<p>
Unfortunately, most systems (all I know from this list) either
are dead, or are small/old experimental projects for obscure
newsreaders (like nn), or are non-collaborative, or turned
into something else.

It is public and open-source, web-based, at least in the first stage,

<p>
The funding for this project has been provided by my company,
Intelligenesis Corp., the coding work is performed by the
Russian E-spaces &lt;www.e-spaces.com&gt; team.

<p>
There is also a distributed Newsfilter group that debates features
of this project in its own mailing list.

<a name="2403qlink3">I also have a number of texts (see Semantic Web, ACF and Semantic Transports,
Message Rating Proposal articles on my site) on the perspectives of semantic filtering, and originally hoped for the extropians to take a more active
position than hoping that somebody else sometime will develop some
intelligent knowledge filters.  But the main thing, it has a good plan,
finally, a good team, and it's starting.

Wanna help?
