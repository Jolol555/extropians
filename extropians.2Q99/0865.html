Abstract
<br>
  Immobilization stress of male
<br>
  Sprague-Dawley rats induces oxidative damage to lipid, protein, and DNA in
  the brain. Significant increases in lipid peroxidation were found in the
  cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and midbrain compared to the
  unstressed controls. Significant increases in levels of
  protein oxidation were also found in the cortex, hypothalamus, striatum, and
  medulla oblongata. Oxidative nuclear DNA damage increased after
  stress in all brain regions, although only the cerebral
  cortex showed a significant increase. Depletion of glutathione showed some
  stimulation to oxidative damage in the unstressed control
  and stressed animals. Further studies of the mitochondrial
  and cytosol fractions of cerebral cortex demonstrated that mitochondria
  showed a significantly greater increase in lipid peroxidation and protein
  oxidation than cytosol. Data from plasma and liver showed oxidative damage
  similar to that of the brain. These findings provide evidence to support the
  idea that stress produces oxidants, and that the oxidative
  damage in stress could contribute to the degenerative
  diseases of aging, including brain dysfunction.
