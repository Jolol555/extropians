<i>&gt; I strongly disagree; if Joe was interested in reducing the level of violence,</i><br>

<i>&gt; calling for banning gun ownership when it's been well-proven not to reduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; violence. If it did, assaults wouldn't be twice as common in Britain as in</i><br>
<i>&gt; America, for example.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Then compare homicides per capita (oh, that's right, that figure is 
unfavorable to your position, so you refuse to consider it).
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1977.html#1998qlink2">&gt; There's also a question as to how you measure 'violence'. European countries,</a><br>
<i>&gt; for example, love to claim that they're less violent than America, yet tens</i><br>
<i>&gt; of millions of Europeans have been killed in wars this century. Which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; really more violent?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
That happened after some european nations built, deployed and 
used massive armaments (just in case you forgot).
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1977.html#1998qlink3">&gt; &gt;(1) If there existed a</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;preponderance of evidence showing that violence does in fact _decrease_ when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;guns are readily available, would the anti-gun forces actually change their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;stripes?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No. There is, and they don't care. I saw a wonderful TV show a few months</i><br>
<i>&gt; ago supposedly debating whether handguns should be banned in Britain. On</i><br>
<i>&gt; the one side were the reasonable, rational gun owners calmly pointing out </i><br>
<i>&gt; the irrationality of the disarmers' position, then the presenter himself</i><br>
<i>&gt; stated quite categorically that they didn't care, they wanted to ban guns,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and ban them they were going to do. Wish I'd taped it, as it was the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; example of disarmers' utter hysterical irrationality I've ever seen, at</i><br>
<i>&gt; least before Joe began posting here.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
To the asinine unwilling or unable to employ consistent logical 
criteria, every excuse made by their side will be seen as a solid 
reason, while every good reason proferred by the other side will be 
dismissed as an excuse, as the Funky Unicorn perpetually proves 
by his misjudgments, malpronouncements, and outright lies.
