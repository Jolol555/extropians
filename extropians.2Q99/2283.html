<i>&gt; 	hehe hmmm... so whaddya think of martial artists? are we more likely </i><br>

<a name="2285qlink4"><i>&gt; average martial artist and an average guy with a gun?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Hmmm...howzabout the ability to kill a dozen people at a hundred 
yards in ten seconds (supposing black-beltish marksmanship 
</a>skills)?
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2285qlink5"><a href="2260.html#2283qlink2">&gt; 	i think the main diff is education. many martial artists, like many </a><br>
<i>&gt; legal gun owners, know what their doing, and how to do it, and what</a> it does, </i><br>
<a name="2285qlink6"><i>&gt; and what the reprocussions of using their violence are. they are not ignorant </i><br>
<i>&gt; about their ability for violence. ergo, they are more likely</a> to be </i><br>
<a name="2285qlink7"><i>&gt; intellegent in their use of violence... and i think that makes all the </i><br>
<i>&gt; difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
If they're responsible, I have no problem with them keeping and 
bearing, but if they have been legitimately identified as 
irresponsible, they should have to relinquish.</a>
