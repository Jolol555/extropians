  &gt;I have a couple q's i would like to have cleared up. First off i =
would like to know what is the ultimate goal of the post human form.&lt;

<p>
  First, there will likely be multiple post-human forms and any =
particular form should be free to alter its form if it so desires.  =
Second, how would we know what their ultimate goals are going to be?  We =
would hope that they would value rationality, knowledge aquisition, and =
freedom for starters.

<p>
  &gt;I hear talk about over population, econimic gitchs due to =
immortality, ect.&lt;

<p>
  I will trade immortality for economic glitches all day long.  And =
overpopulation will be a problem eventually anyway.

<p>
  &gt;It seems to me that the whole point of becoming post-human is to =
break the limitaions of human restriction;&lt;=20

<p>
  It's one of the points.

<p>
  &gt;and there have been statements about future issues due to =
transhumanism that are already human issues right now.&lt;=20

<p>
  Yes, our set of problems will not be entirely new.

<p>
  &gt;My second q is that of the emotion that a human experiences. What is =
the relevance of an emotion in post-human form?&lt;=20

<p>
  Once again, I'm guessing that we will speciate and there will be =
multiple post-human forms, some that have decided to keep human-type =
emotions (though probably enhanced/customized), some that won't.

<p>
  &gt;Any info/links on emotion studys would be great.&lt;=20

<p>
  &gt;Lastly, what are your views on the collective whole?&lt;

<p>
  You mean becoming Borg-like? I see partial collectives as very likely. =
 Hopefully the indvidual will always be able to disconnect and be a free =
agent though.  It is also pretty feasible, I'm guessing, for an =
individual to make whole/partial copies/agents and become his/her/its =
own collective/distributed intelligence.

<p>
  &gt;On an aside, i must highly recommend some music due to the fact of =
the artists mastery of the machine as a musical tool. Some some of the =
best artists out there doing this are; Aphex Twin, Autechre, Square =
Pusher, Jega, and Bola. If you wish to learn more about this music, =
check out www.warp.net. or contact me @ my personal e-mail =
(robot@neo.lrun.com) to gain access to my mp3 site w/ 12 gigs worth of =
IDM (the name of the future music style). Its great stuff.... ;)&lt;

<p>
  Why not just go ahead and give us your web-site with the music files?  =
There's nothing at www.warp.net except an e-mail link.
