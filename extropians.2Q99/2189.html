<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Gun control laws are a miserable failure by any measure; one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't need the Constitution to show that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Notice that, in an Orwellian inversion, he labels those who don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wish everyone, including, children, the mentally ill, convicted violent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; criminals, and spouse and child abusers, to have the perpetual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ability to shoot anyone else within bullet range as "the forces of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; evil."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The first laws limiting gun ownership from certain groups were as follows:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the US, blacks could not own guns in many jursidictions under the KKK enforced Jim</i><br>
<i>&gt; Crow laws right up until the Civil Rights Act, and the Gun Control Act of 1968.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In 1928, in response to 'gang violence' between Nazi and Communist mobs, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; center-right elected government in Germany passed the first german gun control law,</i><br>
<i>&gt; making discretionary permits and registration required at all levels of gun and</i><br>
<i>&gt; ammunition manufacture, transportation, sales, use, and destruction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Mental defectives or others under trusteeship, violators of a whole list of criminal</i><br>
<i>&gt; statutes (even if sentences were commuted), Gypsies and other itinerants, those under</i><br>
<i>&gt; 20 years of age, and people under police supervision and other persons who have lost</i><br>
<i>&gt; their civil rights, were all banned from gun ownership.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When Hitler and the Nazis won 44 percent of the vote in the early 30's, with 265 seats</i><br>
<i>&gt; in parliament, and the Nationalists had an additional 44 seats as well, giving Hitlers</i><br>
<i>&gt; coalition a slim 16 seat majority, Hitler knew he could not survive another vote, so he</i><br>
<i>&gt; had to have martial law declared. Using the 1928 law, they were able over several years</i><br>
<i>&gt; to refuse to renew the permits of all political opponents and Jews, until in March of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1938 they passed their new Reichsgeletsblatt Waffenglets (National Law Book, Weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt; Law) which did the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; a) banned Jews from the firearms business</i><br>
<i>&gt; b) Handguns were singled out for special controls (just like the Brady Law)</i><br>
<i>&gt; c) Nazi Party organizations were exempted from 'gun control' (just like politicians are</i><br>
<i>&gt; exempted now from gun control laws)</i><br>
<i>&gt; d) Anyone "who it is feared may endanger the public safety," could be barred from</i><br>
<i>&gt; owning any type of weapon. (just like the domestic violence weapons laws now)</i><br>
<i>&gt; e) It was prohibited to possess .22 caliber cartridges with hollow point, hollow caity,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or notched bullets.( just like the current "cop killer" bullet laws now)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On November 10th, 1938 a German diplomat in Paris was shot by a Jewish political</i><br>
<i>&gt; protester. This event triggered Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass, where</i><br>
<i>&gt; synagogues and jewish owned businesses all over Germany were pillaged, smashed, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; burned. At least several hundred Jews were killed. The next day, the new</i><br>
<i>&gt; Reichsgeletsblatt Waffengelets was issued, and Jews were specifically banned from</i><br>
<i>&gt; owning any weapons. Ordinary Germans, who were now themselves disarmed, were unable to</i><br>
<i>&gt; oppose the terrocrat activities of the Gestapo and the Waffen SS troops who helped the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nazi party regulars with running Kristallnacht. Thousands of Jews were arrested and</i><br>
<i>&gt; sent to Concentration camps... you know the rest.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I will submit that this lends great weight to the argument that World War II and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Holocaust were able to happen directly because of Germany's gun control laws.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In 1968, Senator Thomas Dodd (father of current Senator Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.)) was</i><br>
<i>&gt; the chairman of the Subcommittee on Juvinile Delinquency, a subcommittee of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Judiciary Committee. Senator Dodd had been a prosecutor at Nuremburg after the war, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; although it was not a part of any of the cases he handled, he somehow got a copy of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nazi Weapons Law. In 1968 he gave this to a translator at the Legislative Research</i><br>
<i>&gt; Service to translate into english. It has been conclusively shown</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Who showed this?  The NRA?  "Silent Scream" propaganda 
transmuted to the gun cause?
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the Gun Control</i><br>
<a name="2425qlink2"><a href="2057.html#2189qlink2">&gt; Act of 1968, that Senator Dodd's committee submitted to the Senate, was an accurate</a><br>
<i>&gt; translation of the Nazi Weapons Law, as adapted for our different legal system, and was</i><br>
<i>&gt; only missing the requirements for a national gun owner registration system and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; national concealed weapons permit system. It was from the Nazi law that the concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'sporting purpose' was borrowed (and is now one of the mantras of Handgun Control Inc</i><br>
<i>&gt; to condemn effective self defense weapons). For 30 years now we have been living under</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nazi laws in this country.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So Joe Dees, how does it feel to be in the company of the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan?</i><br>
<i>&gt; You are, you know.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Such epithets are thrown at every prochoice person in America; it 
reveals more about the mindset of such accusers (who may indeed 
use the spectre of Nazi Germany or slavery to justify right-wing 
violence in America) that it does about those whom they attack.  
BTW, I see no mention of gender or nationality in the laws that I 
have advocated for the US.  I do know, however, that a lot of gun 
nuts, racists, sexists and antisemites run in the same packs - and 
they just ADORE reichean history, don't they, Herr Mike?
