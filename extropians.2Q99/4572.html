[I'm new to the list, so I present my apologies beforehand for any<br>
nettiquete mistake.]

I must confess that I am probably dominated by my hormones, but I don't
like the idea of dealing with an unfulfilled need by just erasing the
need out of existence. That is, in my opinion, the last resource. Isn't
it much rewarding to fulfill the need, if we can?

<p>
Now, sex is nice. It is _very_ nice, indeed. Sure, it has no positive
effect in productivity, and we certainly dedicate a lot of time to it
and related activities, but if anybody thinks that productivity should
be the main goal of my efforts, I'll put him, her or it into my
directory of Borg-related drones.

PS: Yes, it is entirely possible to control yourself (or any other
person) thru the manipulation of the sexual drive. In fact, I can think
of very few better methods to control a poblation (history factoid: most
churches have known that from the first day, and most of publicity works
that way, too). So, how can we _avoid_ having our sexual drive
manipulated? That, I think, is a more important question.
