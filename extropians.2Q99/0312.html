<p>
Ok, I see. What I said earlier only makes sense for a universe that is
spatially infinite but has finite mass. Although for a homogeneous
universe a preferred position may not be needed for SIA-1 since averages
do converge in such a universe, and we can define the measure of
observer-instants as the average density of observers weighted only in the
time dimension. (A preferred time is still needed because the universe is
not homogeneous in the time dimension.)</a> 

<p>
<a name="0325qlink4">So let me clarify my current position. I think a nonstandard analysis
approach is promising, but it can't work by itself unless the universe is
homogeneous in all dimensions. If the universe is not homogeneous, we
need a preferred point.</a> If the universe is spatially but not temporally
homogeneous, a combination of nonstandard analysis and preferred time may
be sufficient.
