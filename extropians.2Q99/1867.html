Really, it has gotten better.  I've met the chief of regulations for
the FAA's AST, Manuel Vega, and he's one of those rare creatures- a
bureaucrat with dedication, intelligence, and a sense of duty.  I
doubt if we'll need more than two full-time staff to take care of
all the paperwork for licensing (in addition to a little time by a
bunch of others including myself).  Space launch vehicles pack a lot
of energy into a small package, and are inherently dangerous to
innocent bystanders.  I've seen the NPRM for RLV's and it's not
onerous- certainly not even a thousand pages to comply.

<p>
I've been a member of self-policing organizations like the US
Parachute Association, and while I am a libertarian, a bit of
organization does help make things run smoother (as in Heinlein's
quote on good manners).

<p>
Anyway, I don't see the FAA seriously getting in the way of me
personally participating in spaceflight (in about a year if things
continue to go well).
