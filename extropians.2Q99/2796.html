I think it can only be a positive, educating oneself in any way. I also went
to college, and lived the lifestyle. Now that I'm older, although I have
aquired a couple degree's already, I find it in my best interest to continue
learning. Therefore I am taking a computer course that comes from the
National Radio Institute in Washington D.C. (I live in Washington  State)
long distance as it may be, I am still learning. It can only be up to an
individual how they chose to the paths for knowledge, but any path, is
better than none. I am however a habitual student, not every one feels the
need to be, but the day I stop learning (or think  know everything) is the
day I can assume I'm dead.

<a href="2755.html#2796qlink1">&gt;I use the internet to learn things. I find out about things I don't</a><br>
<i>&gt;already know, learn details in domains where I have some knowledge, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;discover new (sometimes contradictory) points of view about things I</i><br>
<i>&gt;already know. Don't we all?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm finding that one of the best places to get new information of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;really detailed &amp; accurate kind is to find the online course notes for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;uni course on a subject (computer science courses are a common one that</i><br>
<i>&gt;I use), and absorb those. Some courses protect course materials (keep</i><br>
<i>&gt;them local to uni or require passwords), but many do not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Am I behaving un-ethically if I read, understand, and use this</i><br>
<i>&gt;information? Presumably the course costs money (someone somewhere pays</i><br>
<i>&gt;for it), but I'm skiving. Even if it is payed for through taxes, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;usually taxpayers in a different country (ie: not me).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now I'm not getting the course for free, just the notes, which are only</i><br>
<i>&gt;a piece of a greater whole. Also, they are published on the web, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;presumably the person who did this was aware of the fact.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, I prefer distance education to on-campus stuff, and tend to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;a course by reading all the reading materials, and doing all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;assessment. If I didn't have to do the assessment, I wouldn't (although</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'll do practical stuff, exercises, etc, as I feel I need to for sake of</i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding). So in any practical sense I am doing the course for</i><br>
<i>&gt;which I am reading the notes. (maybe I might want to read the text too,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but then I have been known to do this...)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There's nothing wrong with reading a text book - if you read a book, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;are not ripping off every uni which ever listed it as a text for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;course. So far as I can tell, added value from a uni, for any given</i><br>
<i>&gt;course, consists of the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt; (1) Lecture content created by the lecturer</i><br>
<i>&gt; (2) Tutorials arranged by the uni (providing a tutor and a bunch of</i><br>
<i>&gt;people studying the same topics)</i><br>
<i>&gt; (3) Course notes (possibly lecture notes) which are not available as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;separate publication, but rather only in the context of the course</i><br>
<i>&gt; (4) Internal organisation of courses (compiling all the stuff you need</i><br>
<i>&gt;to know, which you otherwise would have to discover through trial and</i><br>
<i>&gt;error), and providing all the courses to cover an area of knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt;thoroughly (more of the above).</i><br>
<i>&gt; (5) Marking work and giving other feedback on a student's understanding</i><br>
<i>&gt;of course material.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (6) Certification of course completion</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(I have missed out some things here - uni labs, computers, other</i><br>
<i>&gt;equipment? Have I missed anything important in a distance deliverable</i><br>
<i>&gt;course?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By reading course notes, I'm taking (3) and possibly (4) if it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;published. If you compare to distance delivery, you can scrub (2), and</i><br>
<i>&gt;(1) and (3) are collapsed into one entity. So all I'm missing out on is</i><br>
<i>&gt;marking and feedback, and certification. Even feedback isn't too good</i><br>
<i>&gt;with distance courses - turnaround on marking can be quite lengthy, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;marking is only useful often with respect to certification.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So I'm not missing all that much. Am I bad or good?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;PS: I did all the campus culture stuff some years back, and am in no</i><br>
<i>&gt;position to engage in such now. It's better through rose coloured</i><br>
<i>&gt;glasses anyway - I can't drink beer at 10am any more, but I can afford</i><br>
<i>&gt;heating in winter, which I consider a net gain.</i><br>
