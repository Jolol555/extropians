<a name="3221qlink1"><a href="3128.html#3175qlink1">&gt; The me I am now, the best me I could be, the me I will be if I</a><br>
<i>&gt; take this course, and the me I want to be.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Another point-- Are you saying that the completely objective "I" has total
control over the observable "me"?</a> For instance, have all dogs decided to be
interested in sniffing each other's butts, or is this tendency
other-determined, with natural selection as the "other"? Are humans not
interested in each other's butts because their "I"'s have decided it, or
because humans are interested in Humanny things, not Doggy things, and dogs
are interested in doggy things, not humanny things.....

<p>
There are a great many logically unsound premises in your previous statement
that can be explored ! What do you think?
