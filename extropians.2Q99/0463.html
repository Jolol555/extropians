Negative- it is not at all necessary.

It would be a smart thing.

<p>
We have the tech but not the working knowledge nor a viable business
plan, nor
<br>
economic launch capabilities. Fortunately, these things are all being
addressed
<br>
now, after a thirty-year hiatus.
<br>
For an example of a ludicrous plan, see the MIT student proposal titled
"Think Mars"
<br>
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/jts/www/thinkmars.html">http://web.mit.edu/jts/www/thinkmars.html</a>
It appears to be more of an indoctrination into the ways of the
areospace culture than
<br>
an actual, serious study.
<br>
As part of my proposal, tentativly titled "Venture Mars", I have been
asking people
<br>
"Would you be willing to risk dying on Mars in exchange for the
opportunity?", or
<br>
<a name="0511qlink1">"Would you die for Mars?"</a>
<br>
I am receiving very roughly a 50% positive response.

<p>
&lt;&lt;As a long-time space enthusiast
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch1/space.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch1/space.html</a>&gt;, my
thinking about "Big Projects" in space development has undergone
significant
<br>
evolution over the years.  Thirty years ago I certainly would have
pushed for
<br>
an early Apollo-style project for a manned Mars mission, and a
government-funded Mars base as soon thereafter as possible.  Now I'm
very,
<br>
very opposed to such an idea, because I'm sure it would do more harm
than
<br>
good, in the long run.&gt;&gt;

<p>
I concur- just as the Space Shuttle has set us back a quarter century,
so too
<br>
would yet another government-sponsored, corporate welfare program.
Indeed,
<br>
the space station (ISS, Alpha, Freedom, or whatever it's being called
today),
<br>
by sucking up crucial resourses for ill-defined goals, is repeating the
ongoing shuttle
<br>
disaster. Just the cash blown on studies over the last 20 years could
have purchased
<br>
and launched a fleet of heavy-lift vehicles, large enough and cheap
enough to
<br>
put up several stations with relaxed design constraints.

<p>
&lt;&lt;The transhumanist vision has been key in transforming my feelings
about space
<br>
development in one way more than any other: I now feel that patience is
a
<br>
PERSONAL virtue in my desire to reach the stars.  Every year the
technology
<br>
for space development gets better and better and the cost for achieving
any
<br>
particular goal off-earth drops more and more.  If I have a realistic
expectation of a significantly lengthened life span, then it makes sense
to
<br>
be patient.  Now, does this mean that I've postponed my expectations
until
<br>
after some magical nanotechnology breakthrough?  No.  Instead, I see a
positive feedback with technologies that don't require such a complete
breakthrough that puts the solar system into humanity's grasp in a
realistic
<br>
time-frame.  &gt;&gt;

<p>
Again, it's not a question of the technology, but of the economics. If a
resourse
<br>
were discovered on Mars that would fetch $10^9/kg (dilithium crystals or
whatever),
<br>
how long do you think it would take to establish a mining colony?

<p>
&lt;&lt;"Early nanotech", meaning the kinds of material science we can expect
without
<br>
a full-blown Drextech assembler within the next 20-30 years, coupled
with a
<br>
maturing MEMs technology, should lower the strength-to-weight ratio of
spacecraft &gt;&gt;

<p>
Although strength-to-weight is a crucial parameter in some aerospace
applications,
<br>
I prefer to think in terms of "synergistic-capability-per-dollar" for
most hardware.
<br>
Also, a diamondoid ("Drextech") assembler is totally unnecessary for
full-blown,
<br>
strong nanotech.

<p>
&lt;&lt;so significantly before 2030 that we can realistically expect
major advances in near-earth economic development in that time frame.
Establishing a large base on Luna and a largely self-sufficient small
Mars
<br>
colony by 2040 or so &gt;&gt;

<p>
I think it will be much sooner than this, perhaps even within 15 years.
