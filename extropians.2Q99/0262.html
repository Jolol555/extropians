I don't think anyone (excluding hypochondriacs of course) really likes 
going to the doctors. We're all a facsimile of a child who needs a 
little lolly pop reassurance. 
<br>
Last July, I was in a car wreck, those Dr.s saved my leg and my life. 
Everyday I thank God for Dr. Morris. Previous to his arrival at the 
hospital, the on duty Dr. was simply going to remove my leg. We'll, 
I'm walking know. 
<br>
I was given a lot of perscriptions, that I find unnecessary and do not 
take. However I personally am aware of this particluar situation, was 
in my medical benefit. That is not to say that I haven't have negative 
or mis-diagnosed experiences with the medical field in the past or 
that I haven't passing away hours of my day in a waiting room. I have. 
Like every aspect of life, they are people, and we don't have all the 
answers. There have been some Dr.s that I would never see again, and 
then there are the ones like Dr. Morris.
