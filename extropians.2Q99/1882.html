<i>&gt;you make prison life as unbearable as possible, a crook is far less likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt;want to go back to such an institution, so they took out the weight lifting</i><br>

I'm interested in clarifying something here. You have stated that you
are anti-government, and from the above you are also supportive of a
punitive (rather than rehabilitative) styles of prisons. I've got no
argument with someone holding these opinions, although I don't hold them
myself. There's some kind of common ground probably, because I wonder
whether there can really be a rehabilitating prison, and I imagine</a> that
you would have some opinions on this subject.

<p>
<a name="1885qlink2">The way I see it, if you don't trust the government, then you probably
want to have prisons which aren't too awful, because there would be a
fairly high chance of innocent people ending up there. Is this
fallacious reasoning? Do you see a seperation between the government and
the justice system which is relevant (ie: justice system is trustworthy,
government is not)?</a>

<p>
<a name="1885qlink3">I don't mean this post to be inflammatory (although it probably is). I'm
just interested in this juxtaposition of views.
