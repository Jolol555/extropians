What if your life is your work and you are having a really good time
doing it and getting well paid for the same?  When I was 14 I fell in
love with a 360/40 and since then my life is finding ways to play with
toys other people have bought and will pay me to
install/maintain/enhance.  I do it about 14 hours a day x 7 x 365 and
love every minute of it.  Some people tell me I need to get a life,
but the way I see it, I already do, people just happen to pay me
(quite well) to do it.

<p>
I completely agree that you have the right to live your life as you
choose.
<br>
Nevertheless I think there is more to the "get a life" advice than you
are giving credit.
