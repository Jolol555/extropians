This was a trick she played on Neo.  She needed to convince him of that so he would put Morpheus' life ahead of his own.  It was that altruistic sacrifice that pushed Neo beyond the threshold into his transhuman existence.  She embodies the 'trickster' of all
mythological milieus.  Once again, pure genius!</a>
