Showing my age dep't: this compellingly reminded me of a cartoon by
R. Crumb. The caption will suffice as a description: "It's fun to collide in allmeat
 cars!"

<p>
Perhaps a collision-avoidance system could also control an advanced 
acceleration control subsystem (varying the number, type, and position of 
charges that fire depending on the momentary acceleration vector on the 
passenger compartment). A nice cybernetics/mechanics problem. Definite 
design goal: protect the control system to the same extent as the 
passengers' wetware.

<p>
It also puts some constraints on overall vehicle design, but along the same 
lines as what Volvo and others are already doing. It's also limited in what it 
can do with side collisions unless you're willing to reshape cars pretty 
radically (spherical cars, anyone? multi-vehicle collision modelling on a 
pool table?)
