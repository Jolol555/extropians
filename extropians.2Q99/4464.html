I side with Mr Crocker on this issue, and I think his reasoning in
defense of Rob was sound.

<p>
Rob's opinion was, I thought, a bit of an exaggeration of a viewpoint
that is not all that uncommon (although few who see it that way would
ever own up to it).

<p>
<a name="4484qlink1">Natasha's response to Rob was a great example of --- I can't put it
any other way--programming. We are programmed to respond to certain
situations in certain ways. George Carlin's recent rants on the
hypocrisy of American mourning regarding Littleton gives an
interesting insight on all this.</a>
