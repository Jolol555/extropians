has always been problematic.</a>  ATP is an energetic molecule, just asking for
some cell to extract the energy by a controlled chemical decomposition.  If
some theoretical nanorganism (Gina Miller's term) were to adapt itself to
living off of ATP in a cell, and could figure out how to interconnect themselves

<a name="2525qlink1">(perhaps via Jeff's buckytube notion) they could perhaps form a sort of
meta-brain, within a living organism, without otherwise disturbing the host
organism.  One could imagine a whale might be an ideal host, or perhaps
a giant redwood.</a>  Or a human, for the metabrain might be able to somehow
suggest actions for the human to carry out.  Mediclorians?  spike
