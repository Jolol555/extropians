<a name="3951qlink5"><a name="3859qlink1">Joe, I've really tried to polite and reasonable</a> with you, and we
even agreed on some of the details of your legislative action plan
<br>
(some of which is already law).  I don't view myself as an opponent<br>
of yours.

<p>
Why is it, then, that you keep circling back to the same thread and
gratuitously insulting to the folks you disagreed with?  Phrases
like "all the while snidely and surreptitiously snickering like
little boys masturbating in the dark" are not conducive to rational
discussion. The vitriol in your posts is annoying.  Could you please
make more effort to be logical, and tone down the rhetoric?</a>
