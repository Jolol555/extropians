I can hear the howls of anguish from the NRA now. Imagine having to make a
phone call to check someone out before a gun deal!

<p>
By the way - here in Illinois the check is via a 1-900 call - cost me $5.00
the last time - but the check is just a go/no go thing - the sale is still
recorded per other laws, and an FOID is still required. This should be more
than enough of a paper trail if it is followed by all involved. Private
sales and trades here require the seller to keep a record for many years of
the buyer's name - but none of the paperwork is required to be filed with
anyone. I guess that was the lawmaker's way of assuaging fears of a
registry of who's got the gun this week...
