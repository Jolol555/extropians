has increased, we have found more limits, rather than fewer.</a>  Who would
have suspected a speed of light limitation prior to this century?
Who would have suspected the uncertainty principle prior to this century?

You can't use the discovery of the wormhole concept as evidence for
breaking through limitations, if wormholes are impossible.</a>

That must be true or we would not be here.  There are no guarantees
beyond that.  The universe may be friendly or unfriendly, malleable or
difficult to manipulate.  We only know what we have learned, and there
is no basis for guessing that future discoveries will fall into one
category or the other.
