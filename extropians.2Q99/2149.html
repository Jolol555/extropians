New Zealand also has very high levels of gun ownership per capita, although
almost all the gunsa are long barrelled.  Partially it comes from rural
owners owning a large number of guns, ownership levels in urbvan areas are
quite low.

increasing even that total.  -The Player of Games  (Iain M. Banks)
