<i>&gt; &gt;The names of those who do not meet </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the criteria of responsibility (who have been convicted of violent </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;criminal offences, spouse and/or child abuse, or judged mentally </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;unfit by a legitimate psychiatric review) should be kept in a national </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;purchase-prohibited registry, AND NO OTHER NAMES.  If you can </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;prove (say, with your birth certificate) that you are of age (18 </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;seems reasonable to me) and your name does not appear on the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;registry, your purchase should go through.  These registries should </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;apply to, and be accessible by, gun dealers, gun shows, pawn </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;shop owners, flea market owners, and any other place where </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;weapons may be reasonably expected to be purchased by people </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;unknown to the seller.  Those who knowingly sell a firearm or firearms to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;someone on the prohibited registry should be prosecuted for the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sale, and held legally liable for any gun-related crime the buyer </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;subsequently commits with the purchased weapon(s).  Those </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;who have these matters pending or </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;proceeding in court should have their names provisionally added to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the registry, to be removed upon acquittal or judgment of mental </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fitness.  All decisions should be appealable, but the names should </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;remain on the list until the appeals are decided.  Trigger locks </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;should be required to be sold with every firearm, and if a shooting </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;subsequently occurs where the shooter has taken the weapon from </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the owner without consent and the lock was not installed, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;owner should be held liable for neglect.  If the trigger lock was in </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;place but subsequently picked or broken off, the owner should not </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be held liable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sounds like a rework of the Brady Bill and recent Illinois legislation. Why</i><br>
<i>&gt; would anyone object to this?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Brady bills' original three day waiting (cooloff) period seems to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; just an annoyance to legitimate purchasers, and will probably result in</i><br>
<i>&gt; injury or death to people who otherwise may have been able to defend</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves. Lawmakers are pressing to reinstate it even in the presence of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the electronic registry.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I see no reason to have this provision in the law in an age where 
the registry can be checked in nanoseconds.
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2371.html#2385qlink2">&gt; I especially would like to see the liability waiver for trigger locks added</a><br>
<i>&gt; to present legislation - how the courts can apply negligence penalties to</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone who obviously took care to secure a dangerous item is beyond me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How do you feel about proposed limits on quantity purchases? I don't like</i><br>
<i>&gt; the idea of govt. telling me how many of an item I can buy - but again</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't see any legitimate reason for someone to need to buy more than one</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun at a time. A truly rabid collector who just came into lots of money,</i><br>
<i>&gt; maybe?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="2393qlink1">If a collector wishes to collect many guns, and even trade and 
barter them for other weapons with other collectors, fine; but this 
should not be used as a cover for illicit gun dealing.  If a collector 
sells some of his weapons, the sales should come under the same 
registry umbrella as any other sales.</a>
