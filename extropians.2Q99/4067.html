One other thing: Unless someone else motivated, able, focused, and
persistent comes along to spearhead the transformation of the online
Extropian community, it will fall on me to do.

<p>
Thanks to Brian Atkin's tremendously generous and deeply appreciated
contribution, I *will* make progress on developing the information portal
idea and perhaps the NodeNet structure. However, given my ludicrously busy
schedule currently, all my ExI-related time has currently to be focused on
Extro 4. Once that's over with (though I intend to follow it up in various
ways) I can make significant progress in the info portal area. If you don't
see progress on that by late August, by all means call me on it! By that
time, I will have a mere 50-hour (non-ExI) work week, so I should be able
to  make progress.

<p>
Making use of Brian's contribution, though temporarily on hold (I *have*
done some preliminary planning work) will only take us to far. A continuing
development is not something that will happen through complaints, but only
through contribution to the project, whether through financial support (we
continue to carry debts from the past and have found that volunteer labor
does not work well), content acquisition, programming skills, or
organization assistance. Perhaps a separate list shoud be created for those
who want to join ExI's webmaster Brent Allsop, myself, and other
participants to build a improved ExI-2000, an Uber-ExI! (Maybe
