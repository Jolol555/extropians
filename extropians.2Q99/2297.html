The [Danny Dunn] series was conceived by Raymond Abrashkin and
written by Jay Williams. Abrashkin was almost completely paralyzed
and would point to letters on a drawing of a keyboard to communicate
his ideas, quickly developing a shorthand with his co-author, Williams.
Abrashkin died after the fifth Danny Dunn book.
