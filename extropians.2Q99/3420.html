After reading the first article I was skeptical because the authors claim 
EGCG is a better antioxidant than either vitamin C or E.  But while vitamin E 
is fat soluble and protects mainly against free radicals within the membranes 
vitamin C is water soluble and protects in the cytoplasm and nucleus.  Is 
EGCG somehow soluble in both lipids and aqueous solution?  Also the source 
was Pharmanex Inc..  Perhaps they are the suppliers of Tegreen?  Antioxidants 
in general are marketed by wild claims to produce results that they never 
could.  Sure we all need them but there are various factors which make them 
useful that commercially available supplements do not have.  Often only one 
enantiomer is biologically active while the other(s) is not if it has 
isomers.  Physiological conditions can change one form to the next in some 
cases but often not, so what you receive may not even be active.  Also 
oxidation can occur during storage, again inactivating the useful properties. 
 There are also studies that suggest that additional amounts of many of the 
common antioxidants do little more to protect one against free radicals then 
are natural production.
