<a name="1650qlink1"><a name="1649qlink1">Haven't seen the new Star Wars movie (The Phantom Menace) but after
reading an article on it in Time/ Newsweek/ US News &amp; World Report,
 I don't think I  will. There was a quote from the movie featured
</a>
prominently in a caption which I thought seemed to be a major theme in
the Star Wars mythos and in all human cultures as well, which is
perhaps why it resonates so well with the public. The quote is "Don't
think---feel!" 
</a>
<br>
  I read that and gave it some thought, and have decided that
particular sentiment/philosophy, for lack of a better word, sucks.

<p>
<a name="1655qlink1">In fact, it is one of the things I think is wrong with humanity, this
deep reservior of mistrust for rational thought.

<p>
I say, turn it around:  Don't feel--think!</a>
