<i>&gt; &gt;And when exactly have any of us ever said that we'd use a gun as our first</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;defence against any threat? Only a fool resorts to violence if they don't </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have to.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    Mark</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;But guns imply violence, don't they?  "The willingness and ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;protect myself" is good diplomacy, but when someone sees or knows that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;are carrying a firearm, they know that you represent a physical threat.  All</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;ability to compromise on a normal level is forfeit.  My stepfather always</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;told me, "If you pull a gun on someone, you better be ready to shoot them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;because otherwise, when they come down from being scared and pissing in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;their pants, they're gonna get really pissed and want to kill you."  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;applies here as well.  If there is no problem, why introduce new variables</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that could cause new ones.  If you don't have to resort to violence, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;there is no need to have a gun there in the first place.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Pope Arhat Al-Hazred Mateed XXIII</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do guns imply violence, or merely the intention of the carrier to meet</i><br>
<i>&gt; attempted violence with equal force?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Both, but it is equally true that either someone shoots first, or both 
begin shooting at the same time.

<a name="2232qlink1"><a href="2191.html#2211qlink2">&gt; How can one show the ability to defend oneself unless there is some clear</a><br>
<i>&gt; sign that the means to do so are present? Talk is cheap. Having the gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; present may be all that is needed to prevent a situation where violence</i><br>
<i>&gt; would occur.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Just exactly how is someone with a concealed weapon "showing" 
such an ability?</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2191.html#2211qlink3">&gt; Absolute agreement with your stepfather's advice. I have taught my children</a><br>
<i>&gt; just that, and I hope that they never need to actually pull a gun anywhere</i><br>
<i>&gt; other than the target range.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Pulling a gun is very different than carrying one. It's the difference</i><br>
<i>&gt; between being ABLE to shout threats and actually doing so. Unless someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; is considering doing you harm, why should they be intimidated by the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you are obviously armed?</i><br>

<a name="2232qlink2">The fact that you're a stranger, who might well be a violent criminal 
or a lunatic AND legally armed (if a lot of the full mooners here have 
their way) should be enough to chill the typical spine, which I would 
be loathe to turn in his/her direction for fear of being backshot.  If I 
had legal assurance that most likely the person wearing the gun 
was responsible, well that's another story.
