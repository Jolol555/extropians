<p>
I'm going to take the unusual step of replying to my own post, and
disavowing it.  

<p>
I have written some things in the last couple of days that I was not
entirely serious about.  They were trial balloons.  There are some ideas
that go through my mind from time to time.  I wanted to see how they would
look if they were written down and posted on the list.  Now I know how they
look.  I'm not too happy with them. 

<p>
Last night I wrote,
<br>
<a href="0561.html#0589qlink1">&gt; I don't want to be a Power, but the situation leaves me no choice. </a><br>

<p>
Well, of course it does.  The other choice is to get on with my life. 
Nobody's going to nuke my lab.  What balderdash. 

<p>
<a href="0561.html#0589qlink2">&gt; We are entering the age of memetic competition.  </a><br>
<i>&gt; What kind of meme can create a phenotype around itself </i><br>
<i>&gt; that has the strength to survive and become immortal?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; An ism?  A corporation?  or some new kind of meme? </i><br>

<p>
These questions are unreal.  I can survive anyway.  I don't need a meme.  I
don't need a Project.  Making biotechnology into a meme attracts the wrong
kind of attention and skews my judgment.  Ever since I wrote that post, I
have felt disoriented.  

<p>
Biotechnology is moving right along.  All I need to do is make sure I am in
a position to use cell repair techniques as they become available, i.e. I
need to have contacts in the field and enough money to pay for the
procedures.  That's not a big deal.
