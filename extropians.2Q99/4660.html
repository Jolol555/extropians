<a href="4655.html#4660qlink1">&gt;Well, I don't like Clinton much either. My most terrifying visage</a><br>
<i>&gt;of Clinton is the scenes (I've seen 2 or 3 of them now) where Mr</i><br>
<i>&gt;Bill is sitting at a table, surrounded by somber-faced police</i><br>
<i>&gt;officials in full uniform, signing away yet another basic human</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom....</i><br>

<p>
Isn't some group giving out the Orwell award for those who promote
"Big Brother?" As I recall the award is a boot stomping on a human
head...... Nasty, appropriate.... I nominate the jerk from
Arkansas......

<p>
<a href="4655.html#4660qlink2">&gt;Nonetheless, I wonder what is our collective (oh-oh)</a><br>
<i>&gt;responsibility for this guy. When the US was bombing Serbia, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;supposedly went to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But why? Isn't Milosevic their leader? Don't the Serbian people</i><br>
<i>&gt;bear some responsibility for putting this guy in office?</i><br>

<p>
<a href="4655.html#4660qlink3">&gt;There was a Nightline show where Ted Koppel went to Belgrade and</a><br>
<i>&gt;had a little lunchtime chat with some Serbs. They claimed that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;US was deliberately targeting civilians. Ted made the point that,</i><br>
<i>&gt;if that were the case, there would be hundreds of thousands of</i><br>
<i>&gt;dead civilians. It was almost enough to make me think that the US</i><br>
<i>&gt;should do at least one B-52 bombing run over Belgrade civilian</i><br>
<i>&gt;housing, so they could say, 'See, this is what happens when we</i><br>
<i>&gt;deliberately target civilians'. The US didn't seem to have much</i><br>
<i>&gt;qualms about bombing Germans and Japanese civilians in WWII.</i><br>

<p>
This is a big issue you've broached.

<p>
Part of the reason for the Serb attitude on this (IMMHO) is that
people don't like ever thinking of themselves as wrong or bad. I
think media play a big part in this which is why I think all media
are valid targets in time of war ( The first casualty of war is
truth). I would have concentrated on media on day 1.

<p>
<a name="4663qlink1">Maybe we should develop the technology to broadcast our own signals
into a country during these events. One would hope that the
Internet might play a significant role in the future in presenting
a non-governmental version of these events.</a> 

<p>
I agree it is particularly bizarre that any thinking person could
imagine we were targeting civilians when it was completely clear we
hit almost everything we aimed at.

<p>
Of course this also had negative effects, the bombing was so
accurate that the accidental strike against the Chinese embassy was
taken as a deliberate act. The bombing being more accurate than the
intelligence.

<p>
As to targeting civilians, this is the first time bombing has been
so accurate that it was reasonably possible to avoid them. In the
Gulf war about 10% of munitions were guided, over 85% were in the
recent Kosovo event.

<p>
<a name="4661qlink1">I also never understood the concept of civilians anyway since as
you pointed out in many cases they elected their leaders. A
definite lack of personal responsibility.</a>

<p>
I think something like the HEAP (holocaust education avoidance
protocol) mentioned in Neal Stephanson's "Cryptonomicon" is worth
considering.
