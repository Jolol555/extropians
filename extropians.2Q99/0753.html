Hey, I said I have the book.  I didn't say I read it.  Actually, I did read
some of it but remember it being a bit thick for me back then.  It might
still be for that matter.   The main reason I went to visit him in his
office was to get a better handle on how his holographic paradigm differed
from a couple others that I had been exposed to (Michael Talbot, Stanislaw
Grof).  Unfortunately, I left with little more understanding than I came in
with.  I do hope to dig into it a bit more someday, though.
