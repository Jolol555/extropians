<a name="0918qlink1"><a name="0898qlink1">Here is a summary of the BEM results.  I did notice that this instrument
does have a bug.  The mid-point (neutral valence) for each item is 4.  When
there is no directionality in your scores, the survey says so and concludes
that you are Androgynous.  This is only true, however, if your scores are
both above the mid-point since this means that you are endorsing attributes
from both genders.  If your scores are non-directional and below or very
close to 4, you would actually be classified as Undifferentiated, since you
aren't really endorsing attributes from either gender.  Curt Adams, for
example, appears relatively Undifferentiated but was above the mid-ppoint so
I classified him as Masc.</a>

Summary Statistics

<p>
<a name="0898qlink2">Mean    4.14  5.11  Masc

<p>
<a name="0922qlink1">Undifferentiated  11.0%
<pre>
Masculine            55.5%
Feminine               5.5%
Androgynous      28.0%

</pre>
<p>
So, Extropians appear to be strongly disposed toward traditionally masculine
attributes, although a significant number are Androgynous.</a>  I can't find it
in the archives, but didn't the Myers-Briggs test we took earlier reveal
that the largest group was ENTJ?  It's very likely that there's a strong
relationship between these two measures.
