  Protest Fizzles at Pump
<br>
Enthusiastic E-mail Campaign Has Little Impact


<p>
By Jordan Lite
<br>
The Associated Press
<br>
April 30 — A nationwide e-mail campaign urging drivers to boycott gas 
stations to protest high prices kept plenty of people away from the pump 
today. But across the nation, many drivers continued to fill up out of need 
or habit.
<p>
     Business was down by as much as 50 percent at midday at a Chevron near 
downtown Sacramento, Calif., that charges $2.07 for full-service premium. 
The owner, Ross Relles, complained that gas stations are the wrong targets.
<p>
     “Whoever is promoting this idiotic day, all it’s hurting is the small 
retailers like me,” Relles said. “We should be absolutely swamped because 
it’s not only Friday, but it’s payday.”
<p>
     Since the “gas out” originated in an e-mail message, it was tough to 
tell exactly who promoted it and how widespread it was.
<p>
     Mike Lambert, a new sport utility vehicle owner in Newark, Calif., said 
he urged six friends to join him in a daylong boycott in an e-mail message a 
month ago.
<p>
     Within days, he said, others rallied to the cause and forwarded e-mails 
of their own.
<p>
     “It’s time we did something about the price of gasoline in America! ... 
Let’s have a GAS OUT!” read one message that showed up in computers in 
Texas.
<p>
     Global agreements to cut oil production sent the price of gas 
skyrocketing in recent weeks. Explosions and problems at refineries in 
California contributed to an especially sharp spike in prices there, 
prompting an investigation by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer.
<p>
     The latest Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide showed the 
average prices at self-service stations was $1.1733 per gallon for regular 
gasoline, $1.2748 for mid-grade and $1.3598 for premium.
<p>
     The average price in California for unleaded regular, self-serve 
gasoline is up 42 cents from last month, to $1.64 per gallon, the American 
Automobile Association said. Selected markets in California, however, 
continue to report prices of more than $2 a gallon for premium grades.
<p>
     Oil company representatives said the boycott was unlikely to produce an 
oversupply of fuel or lead to lower prices. Still, people avoiding the pumps 
were pleased that at least they were having a symbolic impact.
<p>
     “There’s a conspiracy among oil companies to keep gas prices high and 
profits high,” said Gary Ploss, of Rio Rico, near Tucson, Ariz. “If enough 
people get together, maybe they’ll get the attention of these oil companies 
and maybe something will get done.”
<p>
     Oil company representatives said that prices are set in a competitive 
market over which they have little control.
<p>
     “I think the purpose of the gas out is to send a message of frustration 
and we hear the message,” said Chevron Corp. spokesman Mike Libbey. However, 
he said the company has no plans to lower prices.
<p>
     This winter, American motorists were enjoying extraordinarily low gas 
prices amid a perceived glut of oil on the world market.
<p>
     “Consumers out west have seen prices go from as low as they have been 
in seven years to an all-time high in a period of just seven or eight 
weeks,” said Paul Moreno, a spokesman for the AAA of Northern California.
<p>
     Still, drivers who drive for work and those who drive gas-guzzling 
sports utility vehicles couldn’t avoid filling their tanks.
<p>
     Erika Litchfield of San Francisco was filling up her Land Rover at a 
Chevron Station in the tony Pacific Heights neighborhood, where classical 
music is filtered through speakers at the pumps.
<p>
     “I have no choice. I’m stuck with this,” she said as the truck guzzled 
$30 worth of regular unleaded. “It’s awful, isn’t it? Trust me, if I had a 
choice I’d boycott.”
