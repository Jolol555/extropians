<a href="2769.html#2780qlink11">&gt; to obtain bows is countered by the criminals willingness to purchase guns </a><br>
on the
<br>
&gt; black market.<br>

<p>
Bows take a lot more work to use than guns, require more skill to use, and 
have a much lower rate of fire.  The psychological element is also 
important - a victim is much more afraid of a pistol than of a hunting bow.

<p>
Besides, criminals rarely use rifles.  Usually they want pistols, which 
have a combination of concealability and short-range lethality that no 
muscle-powered weapon can match.

<p>
<a href="2769.html#2780qlink12">&gt; Despite this, I still see a bow as having advantages, not the least being </a><br>
that
<br>
<a href="2769.html#2780qlink13">&gt; if caught, you are likely to serve a lesser sentence for a crime done </a><br>
with a bow
<br>
<a href="2769.html#2780qlink14">&gt; rather than a firearm, as well as the fact that kevlar body armor is </a><br>
useless
<br>
<a href="2769.html#2780qlink15">&gt; against a hunting arrow, which may become an important factor if body </a><br>
armor
<br>
<a href="2769.html#2780qlink16">&gt; becomes popular for civilians now that it is legal for them to purchase </a><br>
it. I'm
<br>
<a href="2769.html#2780qlink17">&gt; not sure of the penetrability of kevlar/titanium layered body armor, but </a><br>
that is
<br>
<a href="2769.html#2780qlink18">&gt; not yet available for civilian use.</a><br>

<p>
Kevlar cloth is less effective against arrows than against bullets, because 
a projectile with a sharp point can cut through the fabric.  This is not 
the same thing as 'useles', however.  If your arrow is less than razor 
sharp it will be stopped easily, and your heavier sorts of body armor have 
so many layers that an arrow isn't likely to penetrate them all anyway.

<p>
Any modern form of rigid armor is pretty much immune to arrows.  They just 
can't concentrate energy well enough to punch through modern materials.
