Why such pesssimism?  The future is certainly not determined already.  I
prefer to belive that people can change their ways, even in ways that
seem drastic.  The coming generations are always a mystery.  The future
is a maze of possibilities to me, and I see that my choices can greatly
influence the way things will go.  The consistent tendencey of humans to
develop better communication abilities is enabling any one individual to
have an ever greater influence over all of Humanity.  That makes
everything quite unpredictable, since I have no idea what some
charismatic genius is planning or even just starting to put into action. 
Just because you haven't come up with a way to modify the behavior of
humans so they no longer destroy the environment doesn't mean that there
aren't thousands of others in the world who may have ideas that will be
very successful.</a>

Ultimately, you have to decide how much time and effort you want to
invest in developing and carrying out effective solutions to the problems
you seem to be deeply concerned about.  I doubt that giving in to your
pessimism will help you accomplish your goals for the world.

believe you will succeed, and at least you will try.
if you believe you will fail, you almost certainly will.
