filter.

Anyway, there are relatively cheap implantable transponders 
with only work on close proximity (few cm) and are hence difficult to
jam. By implanting a tiny crypto-authenticating transponder chip 
into the back of your hand would make their use automatic: the 
weapon won't fire in anyone else's hand. The only way you'd get hurt
is if an attacker wrestles with you while the gun is in your hand.</a>

<a name="3513qlink1"><a name="3424qlink2">Actually I think there should be one-way guns about the size 
of a flashlight, made from a bundle of compound tubes which are 
ignited electrically (lithium battery). By using a visible 
laser diode the aim on short range would be accurate enough. Since
they are already electrical you wouldn't have to mess with
electronics/mechanics interface.<a name="3427qlink1"> If mass-produced, these things
would be very cheap.</a></a>

Point &amp; shoot UI, literally.
