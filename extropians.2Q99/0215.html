 It's nice to hear that a company involved in our defense has reliable
systems.

They probably assume that more users would get annoyed at them if they
did that.

 Failing to discourage a third party from committing a crime generally
isn't a crime. Our society generally assumes that the creator of a
virus is the only one who has done something wrong. As long as it's
possible to track down virus creators and as long as they are rare, that
approach can be more cost-effective than making systems secure. If it
becomes hard to track down and punish virus creators (which wouldn't
surprise me), then security will need to become the responsibilty of
users.

 IANAL, but it seems safe to assume that he'll go to jail if a jury
decides it was deliberate, and I wouldn't be surprised if he goes
jail even if they don't.

 Bug? Anyone who cares already knew that Microsoft products were vulnerable
to this kind of attack. He didn't convey any worthwhile info.
