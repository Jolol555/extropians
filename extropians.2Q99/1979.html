<a href="1942.html#1979qlink1">&gt; A couple of points I'd like to raise here:</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) What possible extropian/ transhumanist merit can this pointless slanging</i><br>
<i>&gt; match have? It seems to be being conducted between sides who are *Never*</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to find a common ground and who are getting more abusive as the thread</i><br>
<i>&gt; continues.</i><br>

<p>
Failure to resolve this on the side of freedom will result in the publicly
accepted implication of acceptance of the views of the pro-political slavery
side.</a>

<p>
<a name="1995qlink2"><a href="1942.html#1979qlink2">&gt; 2) Have you pro gun activists got any idea how completley mad you sound to</a><br>
<i>&gt; non Americans?</i><br>

<p>
Yes, I am sure that slaves are quite bewildered when confronted with
discussions on true freedom.</a>

<p>
<a name="1995qlink3"><a href="1942.html#1979qlink3">&gt; I'm probably going to provoke more rancid vitriol and get shot down in</a><br>
<i>&gt; flames for saying this, but just because something is written in your</i><br>
<i>&gt; precious constitution or your bill of rights does not mean that it is the be</i><br>
<i>&gt; all and end all, that it is simply the only thought worth entertaining and</i><br>
<i>&gt; no alternatives shall be brooked. If this were the case, can you explain to</i><br>
<i>&gt; me exactly why there are so many, or indeed *any* ammendments to your</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitution? I can think of one answer to this: Because it is imperfect. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; was a hashed up solution to the problems of the time and no clear thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; was given to its long term consequences. As such, situations have arisen</i><br>
<i>&gt; which the constitution was never designed to contend with and it has had to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be modified. It is in no way set in stone. Times change, and laws must</i><br>
<i>&gt; change with them. To advocate extropian beliefs on the one hand, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; dogmatic adherence to a quite clearly imperfect constitution</a> on the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; hand seems somewhat at odds to me. But excuse me if I am stepping on your</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitutionally protected toes here, I mean no harm, I'm just curious as to</i><br>
<i>&gt; how you can rationalize this.</i><br>

<p>
For any discussion to move forward, it first must begin somewhere. In order for
all to move forward together, you must all know and agree exactly where all are
starting from. That some people cannot or will not read plain English due to
their own agenda or meme infections is the sole reason why this discussion
cannot progress. That Mr. Dees continues to spout his rude and insulting rants
that are in contradiction to the libertarian/extropian spirit of Unlimited
Individual Freedom

<p>
<a name="1995qlink4"><a href="1942.html#1979qlink4">&gt; As for the merit of this discussion on the list, is it something along the</a><br>
<i>&gt; lines of:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; *I'm looking to the future, but I'll shoot you if you get in my way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or maybe:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; *Well, shucks ma, the end times are a-comin', let's arm ourselves to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; teeth and head for the hills.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not very extropian admittedly, but as far as I can see, neither is this</i><br>
<i>&gt; thread.</i><br>

<p>
The times ahead promise to be very, very dynamic, and full of risk. The power
that computers provide can be used to either greatly free us or greatly enslave
us. Those with extropian values who refuse to be political or support those that
are political are IMHO being extremely stupid, and might as well physically bury
their heads in the sand. Those that do not take active measures to empower
themselves to resist attempts at their enslavement will wind up enslaved.
"People get the government they deserve". You might as well start practicing the
mantra,"resistance is futile" now....</a>
