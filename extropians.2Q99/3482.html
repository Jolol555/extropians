Why get that fancy?  The Constitution does not authorize any body other 
that Congress to pass laws.  In light of the doctrine of enumerated powers, 
it should be clear that Congress has no authority to delegate its 
law-making power to another body.  Therefore, no government agency can 
claim a legitimate authority to create administrative law.</a>

Unfortunately, it doesn' t matter.  Only a few 'radical nuts' would endorse 
this position today, and there is not the slightest chance that the Supreme 
Court would back such an interpretation.  Maybe in another generation, if 
we can manage to roll back the infringements that the puplic is actually 
willing to see...
