 New Type of Mid-Sized Black Holes Discovered 

<p>
The white circle shows the general location of a suspected mediumsized
 black hole within the galaxy M82. The yellow dots indicate 
recent supernovas, which can produce small black holes. Several of 
these may have merged to form the medium-size black hole. (Carnegie

April 13 — This is a Goldilocks story of astronomy … 
<p>
     Once upon a time, astronomers looked through their telescopes 
and detected Baby Bear black holes, dead stars collapsed to a few 
miles wide — so dense that not even light can break the gravitational 
binds. Then the astronomers looked at the center of galaxies and 
found some gargantuan Papa Bear black holes, with masses up to a 
billion suns. 
<p>
     Now they’ve discovered objects that appear … well, if not “just 
right,” at least in-between: several Mama Bear-sized black holes with 
masses between 100 and 10,000 suns. 

<p>
X-Ray Clues
<br>
Of course, no one actually sees black holes, which by definition emit 
no light. But as particles swirl into a black hole, they emit X-rays, 
which are detectable. 
<p>
     For a couple of decades, astronomers have been perplexed by 
unusual X-ray glows within many galaxies. The glows are brighter than 
the X-rays from collapsed-star black holes, but dimmer than those 
from supermassive, galactic black holes. 
<p>
     There appeared two possible explanations: they could be bigger 
versions of the small black holes or quiet versions of the galactic 
type. 
<p>
     Analyzing X-ray data from 39 galaxies, Edward Colbert and 
Richard Mushotzky, astronomers at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center 
in Greenbelt, Md., found that the “colors” of X-rays coming out of at 
least three medium-bright beacons resemble those from small black 
holes. 
<p>
     “You don’t see that kind of behavior from a supermassive black 
hole,” Colbert says. “Also, the sources are not located at the center 
of the galaxies,” as would be expected for supermassive black holes. 

<p>
More Mass, More Light
<br>
But according to models of stellar-type black holes, the black holes 
would have to be between 100 and 10,000 times the mass of the sun to 
produce the observed brighter X-ray intensities. Such a black hole 
would be be smaller than the moon. 
<p>
     Colbert presented a talk about the medium-sized black holes 
today at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society’s High 
Energy Astrophysics Division in Charleston, S.C. The findings will 
also appear in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal. 
<p>
     In a separate talk, Andrew Ptak and Richard Griffiths from 
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh revealed they have also 
found a mid-sized black hole, more than 460 times the mass of the 
sun, in the galaxy M82 located 12 million light-years from Earth. 
Ptak and Griffiths calculated that if the black hole were any lighter 
— and the gravitational pull any weaker — the outflowing X-ray 
radiation would disperse the cloud of inflowing gas, and the black 
hole would fall quiet. 
<p>
     “It’d be basically blowing itself apart,” Ptak says. 

<p>
How Did They Get There?
<br>
The discoveries create a new puzzle. How can the universe create a 
collapsed-star black hole that’s bigger than any uncollapsed star? 
<p>
     “There’s not really a good foundation for how to explain this 
intermediate black hole,” Colbert says. 
<p>
     Possibilities include several small black holes merging into an 
medium-sized one, a small black hole growing by sucking down a 
surrounding cloud of gas or a super-large star producing a bigger-
expected black hole. 
<p>
     “These are that kind of ideas that haven’t been checked before,” 
Colbert says. “We’re just starting to do that work.” 
<p>
     For astronomers, a puzzle to solve is a happy ending and a happy 
beginning.

“There’s not really a good foundation for how to explain this 
intermediate black hole.”
