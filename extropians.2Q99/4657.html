<a href="4654.html#4657qlink1">&gt; Before the worthy list members start a jihad over this matter, allow me to</a><br>
<i>&gt; point out that a number of males share the perception of women reported by</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mr. Harris.  I suggest that we do not kill messengers who bring bad news.</i><br>

<p>
It has been pointed out that this is a minority opinion, and that's
a good point.  I would not want to imply that I think so little of
men in general.  But even minority viewpoints can be strong cultural
influences and major problems.  Racism is a classic example: even
if most people don't overtly believe that some race is inferior,
the cultural history of that belief and the acts of its remaining
adherents cause big problems.

<p>
There are plenty of enlightened men around these days.  I imagine
many, like me, had primarily female influences growing up (I lived
with mom and an older sister while dad was at war).  My image of
women is shaped by the strong, capable women I knew early in life.
But there are also a large number of neanderthals, and they are
frequently tolerated, even admired, by other men and women because
of a cultural history that valued strong men and superficial women.
We should face up to that history and fight it.  One way of doing
that is simply bringing it to light.
