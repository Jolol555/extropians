<i>&gt; algorithmic program.</i><br>

<p>
In that case, you could equip your TM with a deterministic random
number generator.  Cryptographic RNGs can be created very practically
which are thought to be indistinguishable from true random numbers using
even astronomical amounts of computing power.  These results are not yet
proven, but if you can distinguish the output of the "Blum Blum Shub"
RNG from randomness, you can easily factor large numbers, which is
thought to be impossible.

<p>
If this actually makes a difference in whether consciousness is created
or not it would imply that consciousness is non-computational in nature.
It would also imply the existence of zombies (beings which behave
just like conscious beings but aren't actually conscious), since the
resulting TM would act conscious (or else it somehow acts as an oracle
for factoring huge numbers, which would certainly be unexpected).

<p>
A a deterministic RNG is just another computer program, so if a
thus-augmented TM produced consciousness, then the replay paradoxes
still apply.  It does not appear that an appeal to randomness resolves
the difficulties.
