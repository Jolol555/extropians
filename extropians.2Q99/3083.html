mentally incompetent to possess arms?</a></a></a>
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="3055.html#3083qlink2">&gt; In 1994, when the U.S. Congress debated whether to ban "assault weapons," a</a><br>
<i>&gt; talk show host asked then-Senator Bill Bradley (New Jersey), a sponsor of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ban, whether guns cause crime. The host noted that, in Switzerland, all</i><br>
<i>&gt; males are issued assault riþes for militia service and keep them at home,</i><br>
<i>&gt; yet little crime exists there. Sen. Bradley responded that the Swiss "are</i><br>
<i>&gt; pretty dull."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For those who think that target shooting is more fun than golf, however,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Switzerland is anything but "dull." By car or train, you see shooting</i><br>
<i>&gt; ranges everywhere, but few golf courses. If there is a Schuetzenfest</i><br>
<i>&gt; (shooting festival) in town, you will Þnd riþes slung on hat racks in</i><br>
<i>&gt; restaurants, and you will encounter men and women, old and young, walking,</i><br>
<i>&gt; biking and taking the tram with riþes over their shoulders, to and from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; range. They stroll right past the police station and no one bats an eye.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Try this in the U.S., and a SWAT Team might do you in.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Tourists — especially those from Japan, where guns are banned to all but</i><br>
<i>&gt; the police — think it’s a revolution. But shooting is the national sport,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the backbone of the national defense as well. More per capita Þrepower</i><br>
<i>&gt; exists in Switzerland than in any other place in the world, yet it is one</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the safest places to be.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; According to the U.N. International Study on Firearm Regulation, England's</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1994 homicide rate was 1.4 (9% involving Þrearms), and the robbery rate</i><br>
<i>&gt; 116, per 100,000 population. In the United States, the homicide rate was</i><br>
<i>&gt; 9.0 (70% involving Þrearms), and the robbery rate 234, per 100,000. England</i><br>
<i>&gt; has strict gun control laws, ergo, the homicide rate is lower than in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; U.S. However, such comparisons can be dangerous: In 1900, when England had</i><br>
<i>&gt; no gun controls, the homicide rate was only 1.0 per 100,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Moreover, using data through 1996, the U.S. Department of Justice study</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Crime and Justice" concluded that in England the robbery rate was 1.4</i><br>
<i>&gt; times higher, the assault rate was 2.3 times higher, and the burglary rate</i><br>
<i>&gt; was 1.7 times higher than in the U.S. This suggests that lawfully armed</i><br>
<i>&gt; citizens in the U.S. deter such crimes. Only the murder and rape rates in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the U.S. were higher than in England. The small number of violent predators</i><br>
<i>&gt; who commit most of these crimes in the U.S. have little trouble arming</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves unlawfully.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The U.N. study omits mention of Switzerland, which is awash in guns and has</i><br>
<i>&gt; substantially lower murder and robbery rates than England, where most guns</i><br>
<i>&gt; are banned.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here are the Þgures: The Swiss Federal Police OfÞce reports that in 1997</i><br>
<i>&gt; there were 87 intentional homicides and 102 attempted homicides in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; entire country. Some 91 of these 189 murders and attempts involved Þrearms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; With its population of seven million (including 1.2 million foreigners),</i><br>
<i>&gt; Switzerland had a homicide rate of 1.2 per 100,000. There were 2,498</i><br>
<i>&gt; robberies (and attempted robberies), of which 546 involved Þrearms,</i><br>
<i>&gt; resulting in a robbery rate of 36 per 100,000. Almost half of these crimes</i><br>
<i>&gt; were committed by non-resident foreigners, whom locals call "criminal</i><br>
<i>&gt; tourists."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sometimes, the data sound too good to be true. In 1993, not a single armed</i><br>
<i>&gt; robbery was reported in Geneva.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No one seems to be looking at the Swiss example in the U.S., however.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Congress is stampeding to pass additional Þrearm restrictions in response</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the events of April 20, when two students used guns and bombs to murder</i><br>
<i>&gt; a dozen classmates and a teacher in Littleton, Colorado. Yet in 1996, a man</i><br>
<i>&gt; who legally owned guns under England's strict regulations went on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; rampage, murdering 16 children and a teacher in Dunblane, Scotland.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Parliament then banned all handguns and most riþes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But there have been no school massacres in Switzerland, where guns and kids</i><br>
<i>&gt; mix freely. At shooting matches, bicycles aplenty are parked outside.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Inside the Þring shelter, the competitors pay 12-year-olds tips to keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; score. The 16-year-olds shoot riþes with men and women of all ages. In</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact, the tourist brochure "Zurich News" recommends September's</i><br>
<i>&gt; Knabenschiessen (boy's shooting contest) as a must-see: "The oldest Zurich</i><br>
<i>&gt; tradition . . . consists of a shooting contest at the Albisguetli (range)</i><br>
<i>&gt; for 12 to 16 year-old boys and girls and a colorful three-day fun-fair."</i><br>
<i>&gt; The event has been held since 1657, and attracts thousands of teenage</i><br>
<i>&gt; participants and spectators.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While many shoot for sport, all males aged 20 to 42 are required by militia</i><br>
<i>&gt; system regulation to keep riþes and/or pistols at home. In addition, gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; shops abound. Yet Þrearms are rarely used in crime. Homicide is tied to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; willingness to resort to violence, not the mere presence of guns. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevalence of Þrearms in the home and the participation of youth in</i><br>
<i>&gt; shooting matches bind youth to adults and discourages a generation gap.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By contrast, homicide rates are highest in the underdeveloped countries,</i><br>
<i>&gt; many of which ban private Þrearm possession. In some, private murder does</i><br>
<i>&gt; not compare to the genocidal murder committed by governments against their</i><br>
<i>&gt; unarmed subjects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In America, Þrearms take on a sinister reputation from the nightly news and</i><br>
<i>&gt; violent movies. But in Switzerland, Þrearms symbolize a wholesome,</i><br>
<i>&gt; community activity. The typical weekend shooting festival brings out the</i><br>
<i>&gt; entire family. Beside the range is a huge tent where scores or hundreds of</i><br>
<i>&gt; people are eating, drinking, and socializing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With cantonal and riþe club banners þuttering in the wind, the melody of</i><br>
<i>&gt; riþe Þre blends with Alpine music and cow bells.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Since its founding in 1291, Switzerland has depended on an armed populace</i><br>
<i>&gt; for its defense. William Tell used a crossbow not only to shoot the apple</i><br>
<i>&gt; from his son's head, but also to kill the tyrant Gessler. For centuries,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cantonal republic defeated the powerful armies of the European</i><br>
<i>&gt; monarchs. Machiavelli wrote in 1532: "The Swiss are well armed and enjoy</i><br>
<i>&gt; great freedom."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This coincidence has not escaped the notice of those who oppose liberty.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Monarchist philosopher Jean Bodin, writing in 1606, denounced free speech</i><br>
<i>&gt; and arms possession by commoners. Subjects must be disarmed to prevent</i><br>
<i>&gt; democratic sedition, he said. The Swiss proved, Bodin wrongly averred, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; arms bearing was "the cause of an inÞnite number of murders."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Swiss militia model, however, preserved democracy and held Europe’s</i><br>
<i>&gt; despots at bay. In fact, it inspired the rebellious American colonists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; John Adams praised the democratic Swiss Cantons, where every man was</i><br>
<i>&gt; entitled to vote on laws and to bear arms. Patrick Henry, another American</i><br>
<i>&gt; Founding Father, lauded the Swiss for maintaining their independence</i><br>
<i>&gt; without "a mighty and splendid President" or a standing army.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Swiss inþuence is clear in the Second Amendment to the U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Constitution, which provides: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear</i><br>
<i>&gt; arms, shall not be infringed." Today, it has become fashionable to hate</i><br>
<i>&gt; this orphan of the Bill of Rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, a quick glance at history shows that tyrannical governments kill</i><br>
<i>&gt; far more than do private criminals. But Þrst, governments must disarm their</i><br>
<i>&gt; victims. In 1933, the Nazis seized power via massive search-and-seizure</i><br>
<i>&gt; operations for Þrearms against "Communists," i.e., all political opponents.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In 1938, during the Night of the Broken Glass, they disarmed the Jews. When</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Nazis occupied Europe in 1939-41, they proclaimed the death penalty for</i><br>
<i>&gt; any person who failed to surrender all Þrearms within 24 hours.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There may be various reasons why the Nazis did not invade Switzerland, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of those reasons is that every Swiss man had a riþe at home. For this</i><br>
<i>&gt; we have no better record than the Nazi invasion plans, which stated that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because of the Swiss shooting skills, Switzerland would be difÞcult to</i><br>
<i>&gt; conquer and pacify. European countries occupied by the Nazis had strict gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; controls before the war, and the registration lists facilitated conÞscation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Þrearms and the execution of their owners.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By being able to keep out of both world wars in part through the dissuasive</i><br>
<i>&gt; factor of an armed populace, Switzerland demonstrates that civilian Þrearm</i><br>
<i>&gt; possession may prevent large numbers of deaths and even genocide. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Holocaust never came to Switzerland, the Jewish population of which was</i><br>
<i>&gt; armed just like their fellow citizens. In the rest of Europe, what if there</i><br>
<i>&gt; had been not just one, but two, three, or many Warsaw Ghetto Uprisings?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Traditionally, the Swiss Cantons had few Þrearm regulations. The Þrst</i><br>
<i>&gt; federal Þrearms law was recently enacted. Certain Þrearm purchases require</i><br>
<i>&gt; a permit, and others do not. On retirement, every soldier may keep his riþe</i><br>
<i>&gt; or pistol. Surplus assault riþes may be purchased by any Swiss citizen from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Military Department.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The bottom line is one of attitude. Populations with training in civic</i><br>
<i>&gt; virtue, though armed, do not experience sensational massacres or high crime</i><br>
<i>&gt; rates. Indeed, armed citizens deter crime. Switzerland Þts this mold.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Similarly, America's lawful "gun culture" is peaceful. Sadly, some of its</i><br>
<i>&gt; subcultures are not.</i><br>
