No collection police, at least not in the forces we are used to. Thousands
of additional welfare cases? Who in industry will hire ex-taxmen?

<p>
The govt. still needs to be restrained to only spending what is taken in.
If the two ideas could be combined, wow!

<p>
This idea would even tax illegal commerce - as soon as the money hits a
bank. An incentive for govt. to quit with the bank privacy invasion rules
they keep trying to implement. Let the criminals pay their fair share.

<p>
It makes too much sense to ever happen here. Besides, there will be many
concerns about privacy, even if there's no way to track any particular
transactions.

<p>
We can dream..
