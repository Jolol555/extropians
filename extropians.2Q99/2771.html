<a name="2798qlink1">I was recently presented with the artist, Mariko Mori. A lot of her work
represents a happy look at technology and the future. I was curious if
any of you have seen her work, or know where I might find more gallery
work of her on the web. I have seen a ton of homepages, but very few
different pictures. 

<p>
For those not familiar with her, my favorite work of hers is from a
show/cd called "birth of a star." It is listed with the follow
description:

<p>
the artist presents herself as a cyber-pop-star. The visual subtlety of
the image, with its 3D-effect, is continued and reinforced on another
level of sensory perception: a song, sung by Mori, seems to emerge from
nowhere, and the exhibition space is transformed into a total work of
art. She alludes to the traditional role of the Japanese woman, or shows
herself as a "Girly" or a female Cyborg (half human, half machine).

<p>
If you need a reference point, if you have seen her work but didn't know
her name, you can find a small sample</a> at:

<p>
"Birth Of A Star" pictures are of her with white hair and glass looking
eyes. Any information on finding more pictures would be great.
