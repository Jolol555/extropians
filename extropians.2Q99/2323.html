<a name="2343qlink1">Donald J. Sobol wrote the Encyclopedia Brown books.</a>

<p>
Also good in the same vein is "The Mad Scientist's Club" by Bertrand
Brinley.

<p>
Of course, there are Heinlein's juveniles.  In addition to being just
plain fun to read, they seamlessly convey an amazing amount of ideas,
and a lot of solid hard SF speculation.  These are wonderful for adults
as well; if you don't like the later Heinlein, you might want to give
these a try.  I like "The Rolling Stones" and "Citizen of the Galaxy"
especially.

<p>
"The War Between the Pitiful Teachers and the Splendid Kids" by Stanley
Kiesel is a hilarious and damning parody of the public schools, written
at about the sixth grade level.  I recommend getting it to any child of
your acquaintance who is stuck in the public schools.

<p>
Going through my collection of kids' books, I was surprised how few
science fiction books there were; however, there are a great many
stories about talking animals, objects that convey mystical power,
magical other lands, etc.  I'm pretty sure that reading such tales is
part of my attraction to really far out tech; in my lifetime, I may
actually see a talking cat made of glass, or a man who can leap tall
buildings in a single bound.
