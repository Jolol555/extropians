Inability to defend oneself against a opressor of lesser technology but greater
numbers I think is likely to be a very valuable ability. If such opressors need
to be exterminated to stop their opression, so be it. I think though as things
advance, increased intelligence will help establish a more rational understanding
of how to responsibly use such capability.

Wow, I would love to see what most feminists would think about that. All of the
things I hear about rape is that the damage is psychological, which would likely
be far more expensive to repair, if at all possible. I wonder how many raped
women would be satisfied that justice is served just by civil proceedings? "Oh,
I'm scarred for life (i.e eternity), but I'm quite happy since I won my civil
suit against the bastard."

<p>
So while a woman is busy suing some nutjob, he doesn't care how much it costs so
long as he kills her. How do you solve that problem with a civil suit?

<p>
I doubt very much that this will be tolerated much, no matter how much pacifists
push it. There will always be some acts which are completely intolerable and
which the offenders must pay for with their lives.
