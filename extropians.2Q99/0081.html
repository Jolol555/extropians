Yes, Christian Scientist do not believe in medical treatment, even at a 
life or death state. They feel that it is tampering with Gods will. That 
God has a plan for us to be born and to die, and it is not for man to 
prevent. I have heard of cases, where loved ones are brought to the 
hospital to be "taken care of", (ie. someone calles 911 for a nieghbor 
who has a heartattack) but not to recieve any actual medical treatment 
that might save their lives.

<a href="0078.html#0081qlink4">&gt;&gt;It's implausible that the medicine we get (as opposed to additional </a><br>
treatment we don't normally get) doesn't help.  People get things like 
appendicitis, pneumonia in the young, and gangrene which were major 
risks in the past but &gt;very rarely die of them.

factor of two (controlling for lots of stuff), found that any mortality 
benefit of  spending in the last six months of life is less than a one 
part in a thousand.
<br>
<a href="0078.html#0081qlink7">&gt;&gt;That sounds like a biased sample.  People who die within six months </a><br>
are people for whom treatment has failed.  If medical treatment works, 
they won't show up in the sample.  Am I missing something?

<a href="0078.html#0081qlink8">&gt;It is a random sample of all Medicare patients.  It looks at 5000 </a><br>
hospital regions in the country, and predicts total mortality in each 
region from a long list of features, one of which is how much is spent
