Okay, this is what you do.  I don't know what kind of metrics you're
using; let's say you get a metric of 23%.  In this case you declare that
the objective was 15% and you have thus exceeded your objective.  If
they say that you were supposed to exceed the objective, explain that
you were only supposed to exceed the objective by 20%, while you
actually exceeded it by much more.  Likewise, with respect to the higher
standards, what you do is take some kind of token retraining course and
then declare that now 73% of your employees are above average, even for
the new standards.

<p>
The key is to realize that these people do not grok objective reality. 
The sentences are not supposed to be representing truth or even a
self-consistent model.  They are supposed to sound nice.  You are
supposed to output nice-sounding sentences that fit with the input
sentences.  Think of it as a problem in sentence-writing, not fiction-writing.
