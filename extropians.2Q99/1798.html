Oh, people would believe that these things are safe. People will just
about believe anything if it gives them an apparent local-minimum
advantage. People can't help it, since they're built this way. And
because majority rules we'll be always in trouble.

<p>
<a name="1815qlink1">Of course these things won't be safe, even if there was no
autoreplicator capability built-in. No man-made computers are provably 
secure, and hacked nanofoglets make great arms or bootstrap tools
for creating true autoreplicators. Positional control is what we are
lacking, and there is no utility fog without advanced positional control.</a>

<p>
<a name="1806qlink1">(However, I honestly believe no utility fog will be ever built, since
we either screw us up first *real tight*, or evolve beyond the
necessety of needing utility fog at all before we have a chance of

and photons, why on earth would you want to drag atoms around?
