<p>
Freeland, an Extropian outpost above Silicon Valley, is being offered for sale.

<p>
Situated in a private redwood grove in the 'emerald hills' above Redwood City, it was the site of a seminal extropian gathering in March of 1993, when the movement was smaller, younger, and, some say, more enthusiastic.  

<p>
At the time, several extropians expressed appreciation for the uncommonly secluded, private and tranquil setting.  I think it has many unusual features that will appeal to those freedom-loving types who want to be close to the valley.

<p>
This coming weekend, May 21-23, there will be an open house, and offers in the 550K range will be entertained.  I would rather that it stay in the 'family', so special consideration will be given to interested extropians.

<p>
Thanks for the bandwidth...
