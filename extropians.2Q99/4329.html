Yes, another sad statistic from my psychology minor.  About a third of youth
suicides are gay.  Or calculated from another starting point, half of all
gays kill themselves.

<p>
Gays have an extremely high suicide rate.  Sex is
extremely important in our culture.  Growing into relationships is a major
part of teen life, and is a major challenge for gay teens.  The perception
that you will never find
<br>
a sexual mate, or be accepted sexually, can really influence a teen's
development.  The big moral question or peer-pressure against being gay will
force any gay teen to evaluate the basis for cultural rules, the origin or
right and wrong, etc.  Such a teen must develop their own guiding principals
for what they are going to choose to do in their life.  Most heterosexual
never get to this basic question, and spend their whole lives following
culturally dictated norms without question.
