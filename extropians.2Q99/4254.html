They act and speak and laugh and `love', but are mere automatons.  Since
this nightmare is logically possible, Chalmers says, consciousness must be
something over and above mere neural structure in action.  

<p>
How come Chalmers is so certain that "this nightmare" is possible.
Scientists in the field all over constantly mention that they know little
about the internal workings of the brain. So on what basis is he making this
massive assumption? None, I suspect. I've read "The Conscious Mind" and he
doesn't back it up in there.....
<br>
Anyone got any high-tech info on this?

<p>
Rob.
