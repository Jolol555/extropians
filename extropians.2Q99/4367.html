Seems they are switching to conventional engines (derived from NASA's
Fastrak) for at least the initial vehicles.  My bet is that they</a> are going
to use the Fastracks turbine's, but their own thrust chambers (or
something similar). But it seems to be making their potential investors
and customers happy (lower perceived risk).  They claim to have $900
million dollars in orders over the next 10 years, so they may yet be able
to dig up the money to build the bird.

Too bad.  It won't be quite the complete "screw you" to NASA and the
conventional space industry it would have been with the rotary engine.
But it will still be a damn site better than anything else out there, and

job.
