Well, you should keep in mind that Biosphere was more of an ideological 
stunt than a serious engineering effort.  They were trying to build a 
closed _ecology_, while all we need for space missions is a closed life 
<a name="3618qlink1">support system.  We don't need a zillion difffirent kinds of plants, bugs 
and whatnot, we don't need 'natural' landscaping, and we sure as heck don't 
need multiple environments.</a>  Besides, the idea of doing all the cultivation 
by hand is stupid - if you can't mechanize it somehow, you're never going 
to get anything else done.

<p>
A realistic effort would take a completely different approach.  A lot of 
the basic air and water recycling can be handled by conventional mechanical 
systems, so do it that way.  Maintain a garden (part conventional, part 
hydroponic) for growing food crops, and use processed sewage as fertilizer. 
 Take along equipment for manufacturing fertilizers from local materials, 
and you're set.  This is still a pretty big setup, but it isn't anywhere 
near as bad as Biosphere.
