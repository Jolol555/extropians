<i>&gt;as in vitro gestation and male pregnancies. They could help erode even</i><br>
<i>&gt;more of the old assumptions (if they ever get popular).</i><br>

<p>
My only qualm about this is that many people seem to make the assumption
that just because a desire is biological in nature, i.e. a woman's desire to
have childen, that this desire is somehow wrong or needs to be changed. I
certainly support any woman's desire to not have children, or even to remove
any hormonal influences dealing with this desire; however, I don't think
that makes the desire inherently wrong. Sexual desire is also an
evolutionary tool, but I don't see anyone waiting in line to get rid</a> of it.

<p>
<a name="0796qlink2"><a href="0790.html#0791qlink2">&gt;The downside is that we are the weaker sex; I'm not sure about the</a><br>
<i>&gt;perturbation thing (never seen any data on it), but we have a higher</i><br>
<i>&gt;mortality due to what appears to be a slightly less robust</i><br>
<i>&gt;construction. That is why you find plenty of old widows but few old</i><br>
<i>&gt;widowers.</i><br>

<p>
I saw a very interesting show on TLC the other night about gender
differences, and they came with an interesting reason why woman tend to live
longer than men, even assuming identical lifestyles: historically,
grandmothers are more important to families than grandfathers. Makes sense
when you think about</a> it.
