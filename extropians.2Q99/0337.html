<p>
Do you use nicotine or cholinergics yourself? Is there any 
cholinergic that you would recommend? Deprenyl?

<p>
I use nicotine chewing gum or microtabs, though only when I do 
difficult intellectual work. That way, if I were to become addicted, 
I would simultaneously become addicted to hard thinking -- not such a 
bad thing! I haven't tried any cholinergic yet. As for caffeine, I 
try it periodically, but I haven't figured out whether the net 
effect is beneficial for me. It seems to affect me differently on 
different occasions.

<p>
Are there any other chemical substances or psychological techniques 
that you find particularly useful?
