Fortunately romance has a large cognitive part :-)

<p>
Yes, but that shouldn't scare us from trying (genetics is darn
complicated, and we can still do useful things with it). 

<p>

<a href="4656.html#4659qlink3">&gt; suggest disabling the mechanisms of action that causes the testosterone</a><br>
<i>&gt; to increase the libido, rather than lowering the testosterone level. </i><br>
<i>&gt; This might have fewer complications.</i><br>

<p>
True. As a neuro-person, I would go for the brainstem and hypothalamus
and look for the receptors (I'm to lazy today to websearch about
exactly which parts to deal with). Then you could block the receptors
locally somehow (a very specific antagonist), but I would guess you
would also need to splice in an extra signal to the pituary gland
since I'm quite certain some of the hypothalamus sex centers are also
responsible for controlling the production of sex hormones and if they
get too little testosterone input they will likely send more signals. 

<p>
<a name="4749qlink1">I really want to hack my hypothalamus! There are so many routines
there I really would like a better interface</a> for...
 
<p>
<a href="4656.html#4659qlink4">&gt; A large excess of testosterone, in the amounts used by some</a><br>

<p>
And in sufficient doses actually act as a contraceptive, ironically
enough.
