<a name="3119qlink1"><a href="3097.html#3114qlink1">&gt; I think (or at least I hope) Cynthia's reference to "defective"</a><br>
<i>&gt; people meant those who are predisposed to criminal violence--not</i><br>
<i>&gt; something one associates with Jews or Japanese.  How accurate</i><br>
<i>&gt; those stereotypes are is another subject.  And if you ask me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; pathological conformism is a mental defect rampant in the Japanese</i><br>
<i>&gt; population; I don't know how genetically-influenced that is.</i><br>

I don't think that lower testosterone levels are cultural, nor are small
delicate hands, and tiny noses.  And these outward measurable qualities seem
to be things civilized people have been breeding themselves<a name="3146qlink1"> for.  If I was a
space alien, I would think of asians as domesticated people,</a> and Africans as
the wild type. But I wouldn't say that one type was especially superior to
the other.
