<p>
Well obviously if we never try anything new, we can't really
say for sure whether it will solve it can we? (let's assume
I shoot down your next two objections)

<a href="2622.html#2624qlink2">&gt; 2. It will result in lots of boring debates as to whether someone put the</a><br>

<p>
legit point... I think the keywords that have been used before
are quite "separate" from each other. It will be obvious when
someone is really abusing them in order to spam the list. But
there is no need for us to debate about it or even discuss those
transgressions if ExI will step up and handle those situations.
In fact you could even have a special keyword that is required
to be used for these types of discussions, and you can filter
out all those messages if they did start appearing, and you 
don't want to read them. (let's assume that most of the people
debating keyword correctness will use the right keywords, eh?)

<p>
The fact is, is that there is only a small number of people
that would likely violate the keywords purposely in an
ongoing manner. These people might require a bit of public
debate before getting them banned. Other people might occasionally
make a boo-boo, but if you simply emailed them off-list about
it, they would not do it again.

<p>
<a href="2622.html#2624qlink3">&gt; 3. It goes a long way towards disproving Extropian ideals ('If freedom is</a><br>
<i>&gt;    so great, how come you don't have it on your list?').</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Well according to the principles, extropy is the extent of a
system's (mailing list's ?) intelligence, information, order,
vitality, and capacity for improvement. Obviously freedom is
also a big part of being Extropian. But face the fact that
what I suggest would likely improve the extropy of the list
whereas lately it has been decreasing. And explain to me
exactly how requiring a keyword limits anyone's freedom to
speak?

<p>
I think it might also make people think at least a little bit
more before posting since at least they would have to figure
out what keyword to post under.
