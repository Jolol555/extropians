&gt; As far as I remember, the guy was dressed up in some outlandish costume

</a><i>&gt;  behaviour; the jury obviously agreed.</i><br>

Actually, I think now you're confusing that with the case</a> of a drunken Scot 
<a name="3357qlink1"><a name="3242qlink7">who got shot in Houston under the circumstances you describe.</a> -- The Japanese 
<a name="3242qlink8">kid in Louisiana never went around to the back of the shooter's house.</a>  The 
<a name="3242qlink9">Scot here in Houston did and apparently seemed pretty threatening.</a>  From the 
<a name="3242qlink10">accounts I've read, the kid in Louisiana didn't seem to have been</a> acting in a 
<a name="3242qlink11">particularly threatening way -- although he WAS in a Halloween costume.
