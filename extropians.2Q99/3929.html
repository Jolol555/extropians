Allowing married couples to stay in one cell, allowing people
books, TVs, and maybe small PCs (should help with intellectual
skills and later socializing, and can be donated), and probably
choose cell mates among their friends, could prevent thousands
of rapes at much smaller costs than it would require outside of
jail.  And of course, not persecuting people for victimless crimes.</a></a>

prevents - or at least than it punishes.</a>
