<a name="1795qlink1">I'm finding the ongoing discussion of Natural Law on this list
facinating - not really for the content, but for the location. It seems
that Natural Law has become (to some) a justification of private
property rights because it is "Natural", it pertains in some way to
"evolution", and it is simply the best system that we can come up with,
tried and true, etc...

<p>
<a name="1809qlink1">Humanity has naturally evolved into its present form over billions of
years, but none of us are particularly happy with the current form (a
fair job, good ideas, seems to die rather to frequently, please pay more
attention to neatness, final mark 6/10). Evolution is the antithesis of
the transhuman, one would think. The whole idea of transhumanism seems
to me to be about breaking the evolutionary shackles and reinventing our
universe as we see fit.</a>
