<i>&gt; &gt; I would FAR RATHER discuss technologies which would develop people's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  self-control and reason such that they are CAPABLE of handling such</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  technologies.  Humans nowadays are barely evolved past monkey stage, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  I'm usually not at all convinced that we have gone beyond monkeys.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Especially en masse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  So why on earth are we even discussing such a concept? Shouldn't we be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  working on techniques to enable us to control ourselves, before throwing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  heavy weapons about?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  And yes, I realise that such technologies WILL be in the public hands</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  before long, but then I'm profoundly pessimistic about the future of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  human race.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; [snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Sure, but I also don't think allowing everyone to do whatever the hell</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  they want is a great idea for large societies with concentrations of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  people.  That sort of thing only benefits the rich, who can afford to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  protect themselves, which as far as I can tell is the motivating force</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  behind libertarianism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dwayne, with all due respect, perhaps these last comments and some of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; other ones above demonstrate why the "gun debate" seems to drive such deep </i><br>
<i>&gt; and emotional wedges between people.  Although we try to be rational and </i><br>
<i>&gt; realistic, by and large extropians are optimistic about the future of </i><br>
<i>&gt; mankind.  Most of us take an adventurous attitude toward individual liberty </i><br>
<i>&gt; and don't feel threatened by the idea of "concentrations of people" that are </i><br>
<i>&gt; free from high levels of governmental constraints. And I think people who </i><br>
<i>&gt; call themselves extropians should certainly not fear liberty as something </i><br>
<i>&gt; that "only benefits the rich"; far from it: Extropians see liberty as a </i><br>
<i>&gt; condition of prosperity for each individual and society as a whole.  Finally, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have to take exception with the idea that "allowing everyone to do whatever </i><br>
<i>&gt; the hell they want" could in any way be considered a fair characterization of </i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarianism. Rather, it is the sort of rhetorical caricature that can only </i><br>
<i>&gt; inflame thoughtful people who come to value liberty as a primary ingredient </i><br>
<i>&gt; of a healthy society after a life-long study of history -- which is how I </i><br>
<i>&gt; would characterize myself.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Go bite me, Michael.  I'm not interested in debating guns with you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  because your argument is bullshit, okay? I have the option of moving to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  the US and living in a "free" country armed to the teeth.  I have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  currently-standing offer of work and a place to stay in San Francisco.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  The concept of living in the US terrifies me, frankly, as I quite like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  the fact that I can walk *anywhere* in the city I live in (4 million</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  people) and not get shot.  I have a couple of friends who are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  considering similar options. We all feel the same way.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As I've done at least once before, I feel compelled to point out for the </i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit of those who may not have visited the States that the vast majority </i><br>
<i>&gt; of Americans do not live in fear of gun violence, that action and gangster </i><br>
<i>&gt; movies are not an accurate depiction of life in American cities, that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; vast majority of Americans never hear a gunshot outside of a shooting range </i><br>
<i>&gt; or hunting trip, that there are many peacefully racially integrated </i><br>
<i>&gt; neighborhoods (mine included) where people from wildly different cultural, </i><br>
<i>&gt; ethnic and racial backgrounds live together with civility and mutual respect </i><br>
<i>&gt; and that violent crime simply isn't part of the day-to-day experience of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; great majority of Americans.  I know from personal experience that European </i><br>
<i>&gt; cities are different from American cities, but not in the way that I too </i><br>
<i>&gt; often see caricatured: The trade-offs of freedom and security are real, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; they are more subtle and the differences in the texture of life is not really </i><br>
<i>&gt; so great as one might imagine from reading material like the paragraph above.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I would like to remind everyone that most victims of gun violence, 
most likely including the kids at Columbine High, do not fear it until 
the shooting starts.
