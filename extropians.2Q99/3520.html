<a href="3501.html#3520qlink1">&gt;Thatcher was socialist?</a><br>

<p>
I'd say Thatcher was more of a fascist, but that's not what I was talking 
about. Britain used to be an incredibly socialist nation, and while Thatcher
increased that in some areas (more taxes, more Health Service funding) and 
it's still far more socialist than America in most areas, it's hardly 
comparable to the state it was in before she was elected.

<p>
I'm quite happy to fix my 'buggered bits'. What offends me is the continual
suggestions of forcibly 'fixing' other people's 'buggered bits'.</a> Not to

<p>
Because if you don't get angry when you ask them to stop they're not going
to know how much you want them to stop.</a> Anger is a well-developed social
<a name="3611qlink5">convention which tells other people when they've gone too far.
