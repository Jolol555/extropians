I met him at a Space Society convention around the same time, and had a
similar experience.  He was always careful to get his facts right, limit his
statements to what they support, and in general avoid wild speculations.  I
remember him listening politely to quite a few people who obviously had no
clue what they were saying, and he never showed a trace of that air of
superiority so many celebrities put on.
