<a name="3586qlink3">That's precisely my point; new technologies tend to take longer to build

Yes, but there's still plenty of room in the 80x86 architecture,</a> and they
<a name="3586qlink5">could bolt on a 64-bit kludge just like the prior 32-bit kludge. The main
aim of Merced and the Camino chip seems to be locking people into a
proprietary Intel architecture so they can eliminate competition and boost
profits, not any essential technical improvements.</a>

<p>
<a href="3430.html#3512qlink5">&gt;I think Merced architecture is stale already well before it has become </a><br>

<p>
Merced itself certainly is; the architecture may well be a good idea, if
they can ever make it work.

<p>
<a name="3586qlink6"><a href="3430.html#3512qlink6">&gt;There is no need to go dedicated. If there are hundreds or thousands</a><br>

<p>
Why pay for hundreds of expensive CPUs if you can do the same job with one
CPU and nine dedicated support chips?</a>

<p>
<a name="3586qlink7"><i>&gt;God, we can do embedded RAM now. </i><br>

<p>
But it's very hard to do anything useful with embedded RAM because any
reasonable amount bloats the die size so much. My graphics card has 32MB
</a>
<a name="3586qlink8">of RAM; you're not going to fit that into a single chip with a graphics
controller that already has close to ten million transistors and get any
kind of affordable yield.  Plus, of course, once you've built your chip
with 32MB of RAM you can't then expand it without replacing the entire
chip.</a>

<a name="3586qlink9"><a href="3430.html#3512qlink7">&gt;There is a lot of silicon</a><br>

<p>
You should really talk to the people who've tried WSI before making claims
as to how wonderful it's going to be. The only company I know of who ever
did it are Anamartic, and they had a hell of a time making it work; do they
even exist anymore?
