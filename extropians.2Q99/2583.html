You know, I felt a little guilty, during the Singularity debate, that
around 75% of the discussion had taken place a few years back and we
were just rehashing it.  I used to feel guilty about objective morality
threads.  Now I realize that if not for that, the list would have been
debating gun control instead.

<p>
So - anyone want to start a dogmatic, pointless debate about
observer-independent goals, unknowability, the danger of nanotechnology?
 If not, I'll just assume that everyone agrees with me about everything.
