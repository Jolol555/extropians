Star Trek 4 had some great lighter moments, such as:


<OL>
  <li>  Spock nerve pinching the obnoxious punk rocker

  <li>  Spock's mastery of 20th century American slang:


  <UL>
    <li>  scientist:  You stay the hell away from my whales!
    Spock:  They are not the hell *your* whales.


  </UL>

</OL>
<p>
    -Kirk:  How long until impact Mr. Spock?
    Spock: Approximately one damn minute, captain.

<p>
3.  Scientist, picking up the tab for the pizza: I suppose now
you're gonna tell me no one has money in the 23rd century?
Kirk:  We dont!

<p>
4.  The final scene with the normally stone faced crew splashing
about and yukking it up in the San Francisco Bay.

<p>
Hilarious!  At times I feel our list needs a bit of lightheartedness
mixed with the heavy science/technology/political ragings.  Please,
what is the point of extending our lives if we are not having fun?

<p>
I do hope every one of you had access to some PBS station and
caught the three hour "Stealing Time" special.  {8^D  spike
