Abstract
<br>
  Ten groups of 14 immunosuppressed NMRI-mice (nu/nu) were raised and kept
  under germ-reduced conditions. The control animals were fed a germ-reduced
  diet, nine other groups received the same diet with
  selegiline (CAS 14611-51-9, Deprenyl) or lipoic acid
  (thioctic acid, CAS 62-46-4) admixed at various amounts. The 50% survival
  rate, the total life span of each group and the areas under the curves were
  determined to evaluate life expectancy as compared to the controls. The
  racemate of lipoic acid at high dosage (350 mg/kg body weight) reduced the
  life span significantly. The S(-)-enantiomer of lipoic acid (75 mg/kg body
  weight) increased the 50% survival rate, whereas the physiologic
  R(+)-enantiomer (9 mg/kg body weight) expanded the total life span of its
  group. Alteration of only one out of three parameters was not considered
  significant. All other groups except for one did not differ from controls:
  only animals which obtained 75 micrograms selegiline per kg
  of body weight and per day exerted increased life expectancies by all three
  parameters. This group exhibited also in statistical evaluation a
  significantly (p &lt; 0.05) prolongated survival time up to about 200% as
  compared to the control animals.
