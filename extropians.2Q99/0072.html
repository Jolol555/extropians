Jesse starred in several movies, including in Predator with Arnold Schwartzenegger. He also was mayor of his hometown prior to running for governor and apparently was credited with doing a good hob there, as well as having that as a platform to generate additional name recognition and soap boxing.

<p>
<a name="0077qlink1">People in that state embraced him EXACTLy because he was a wrestler. The only class of person less trusted that a car dealer is a politician,</a> so even if your allusion were true, then it was not much of a reach for him.
