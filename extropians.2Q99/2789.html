Jury deadlocks in lawsuit over alleged stolen DNA

<p>
1999 Associated Press

<p>
SAN FRANCISCO (June 2, 1999 7:34 p.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nandotimes.com">http://www.nandotimes.com</a>) - A
federal court jury deadlocked Wednesday in a lawsuit by the University of
California accusing Genentech Corp. of violating a university patent to
develop the company's lucrative human growth hormone.

<p>
Jurors voted 8-1 in the university's favor, but were unable to resolve the
impasse during six days of deliberations, two jurors told reporters.

<p>
The jury resolved another issue in the university's favor, rejecting
Genentech's claim the 1982 patent was invalid. That verdict will be binding
in a retrial of the infringement issue, said U.S. District Judge Charles
Legge.

<p>
The university accused Genentech, a leading biotechnology firm, of using
stolen DNA covered by a UC patent to develop the top-selling hormone
Protropin.

<p>
Genentech denied that genetic material taken from a UC San Francisco lab in
1978 was used to develop the treatment.

<p>
The suit sought $400 million in damages, which could have been tripled for
willful patent infringement.
