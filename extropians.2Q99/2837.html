Did you lie to them, or about them (as you did about me, and I 
have yet to receive my justly deserved apology and retraction).

<i>&gt; continue to not see them because us nice, reasonable people refuse to point </i><br>
<i>&gt; them out, they continue to believe the anti-gun arguments; you don't convince</i><br>

<i>&gt; like gun debates is for them to jump on the anti-gun posters as soon as they </i><br>
<i>&gt; try to start one, not to complain about us when we respond; I can't think </i><br>
<i>&gt; of any occasion when a pro-gun poster has started one of these debates.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I will not be silenced by blued-steel fundamentalism, and will 
continue to present the reasonable, rational and logical alternative 
to your message of universal armament.  It is NOT rational or 
reasonable to insist, as you do, that violent criminals, kids and the 
certifiably insane should have free and unfettered access to 
purchase and possess the means to commit mass long-range 
homicide.  If you do not insist on this, then say so.  If you do insist 
on this, say so, and why.
