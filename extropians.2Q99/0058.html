Robert Fogel, economic historian and Nobel Prize winner, gave his AEA 
presidential address on 4Jan99, and said:

<p>
  Technophysio evolution requires not just marginal adjustments, but major 
  leaps in economic theory.  We are slow in pondering such grand questions 
  as the implications of the Human Genome Project, which is now nearing 
  completion, and the emergence of molecular medicine for the future of 
  economic life.  We have entered an era in which purposeful intervention 
  in evolutionary processes is passing beyond plant and animal breeding.  
  The new growth economics needs to incorporate at least some aspects of 
  directed, rapid human evolution. Endogenous technological change needs 
  to extend to the fundamentals of human behavior.  Theorists also need to 
  grapple with the ethical implications of technological changes that, 
  whatever their positive aspects, threaten to undermine the mystery of 
  human life by transforming people into "material" that is transplanted, 
  cloned, arbitrarily changed in personality and intelligence, and 
  otherwise manufactured in ways that challenge the definition of a human 
  being.  ["Catching Up with the Economy", Am. Ec. Rev., 89(1):1-21, 3/99]

<p>
That is, Fogel chided economists for not paying more attention to the 
sort of issues we discuss here.  His normative take on these topics may
be different from ours, but I welcome the positive study he calls for.
