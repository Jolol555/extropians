Hey, I am 10000000000000000% behind Eugene as far as this goes.  I first

subscribed to this list in 1993 I think. Maybe 1994.  I have only ever
lurked because this place is a sinkhole of gun nuts and radical
capitalists, and I get enough of that on Usenet. I regularly subscribe
and unsubscribe.  If there were more reasoned discussion and less naked
aggression and argument, I'd probably write a dozen messages a day, but
I don't because there's not enough wheat to make the chaff palatable.

<p>
This list used to be an ASTOUNDING place for people thinking about the
future. It was one of the reasons I used to feel that my life had been
greatly enriched, even *blessed* by access to the internet. Seriously,
it was that good and made that much of an impression on me.  Now it
comes across as some patriotic US flag-waving forum, you know, just
another email list, instead of one of the intellectual high-water marks
of the internet, which it used to be.  Hell, I got email from Marvin
Minsky after I wrote something to this list.  I wonder if he is still
subscribed? I'll bet he isn't, and it won't be because he is too busy,
I'll bet.

<p>
And yes, I know that *isn't* what it is, so calm down.  But that is how
it comes across to non-americans.  Perhaps you might care to do
something about it?  It's your list, after all.
