I was trying to be open minded in not pointing this out...

<a href="3024.html#3073qlink2">&gt; I don't know where you got 1998 numbers, since the Chicago Police</a><br>
<i>&gt; Web site doesn't have them yet. But you fail to mention that 33% of</i><br>
<i>&gt; murders are gang related, 22% are altercations, 14% robbery, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; 13% narcotics, 66% of the murder victims knew each other.</i><br>

<p>
The "knew each other" term is useless. If you happen to be passingly familiar
with a guy who hangs out on a street corner, maybe you know his first name, then
according to the Chicago Police you "know" him. If he happens to be a drug
dealer and he hold you up one night, and you defend yourself and kill him, then
you knew the person you attacked....hows that for accuracy in statistics.

<a href="3024.html#3073qlink3">&gt; The gun shops are not strategically located for maximum advantage,</a><br>
<i>&gt; Chicago is ringed with suburbs because of geography. I live in one</i><br>
<i>&gt; of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So explain how the suburbs, with the gun shops and a much greater</i><br>
<i>&gt; population don't have a gun problem?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why did the Mayor and City council exempt themselves from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; handgun ban?</i><br>

<p>
Politicians always exempt themselves from their own laws.

<p>
<a href="3024.html#3073qlink4">&gt; Why did they in fact pass special legislation that allows them to</a><br>
<i>&gt; conceal carry?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 15,000 weapons are seized in Chicago each year, yet almost zero</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosecutions..... Why?</i><br>

<p>
Cause then the crooks will inform on the guy who sold them the gun, who was a
cop.

<p>
<a href="3024.html#3073qlink5">&gt; Why do 97%+ of all gun crimes in Chicago take place in certain</a><br>
<i>&gt; neighborhoods?</i><br>

<p>
Sorry, its wrong to make ethnic or economic associations in this matter....
