Actually, when I read Van Den Broeck's warp drive paper yesterday, my 
main criticism was that he hadn't modeled actually putting anything 
inside his pocket.  Sure it has a diameter of 200 meters, but it is 
modeled as being totally empty.  Since he calcualtes he needs a few 
grams of negative mass region, I doubt if he could put much more than 
a few grams of positive mass inside and keep his approximation 
reasonable. (I suspect more mass would just collapse to a black hole.)  
Also, since the surface area is only 2000 plank lengths, bandwidth 
between it and other places would be severely limited. 

<p>
So maybe you could make a few grams filling 200 meters fly at 
warp speed, but that's far from a jupiter brain.
