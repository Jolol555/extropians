Some possibilities spring to mind.
<br>
Maybe there are (at least) two kinds of rapists: one for whom rape is power
and one for whom rape is sexual access.

<p>
A testable prediction from socio-biology is that the majority of rapists are
in the latter category (evolution could not sustain a high frequency of the
former as they require a relatively large pool of trusting victims upon whom
to prey).

<p>
A second prediction, this time from the rape=power theory, is that rapists
of the power type only choose rape because that is the most
humiliating/power-gaining thing they can do to someone.

<p>
This theory, then, predicts exactly the opposite to the rape=sex theory.

<p>
It predicts that the frequency of rape will be proportional to the
displeasure experienced by the victim, while rape=sex predicts that rape
will be inversely proportional to displeasure/resistance.

<p>
I don't know what the answer is. I suspect that this kind of person makes up
only about 10% of the prison population and only about 1% of the general
population - thankfully.
