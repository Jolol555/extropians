<a href="3087.html#3100qlink1"> &gt; Of course not.  First of all, the Swiss have effectively stopped defective people</a><br>

<i> &gt; Japanese).</i><br>
 
<p>
Strange, I thought the incidence of mental retardation in isolated
Alpine valleys was pretty high due widespread inbreeding (you see,
rednecks are not an U.S. invention). On an unrelated vein, thyroidal 
dysfunctions are also widespread since most of the iodine has been 
leeched after the Ice Age.

<a href="3087.html#3100qlink2"> &gt; And the few defective people they do have, are either in their families care, or</a><br>
<i> &gt; in some kind of institution (mental hospital or prison).</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; But here we have the myth that there is no such thing as a defective person, just</i><br>
<i> &gt; under funded schools.   And instead of putting violent people into prison, we</i><br>
<i> &gt; have social reformers who want to make the whole country a prison.</i><br>

<p>
I think you very much overestimate the impact of genes and
understimate that of memes.
