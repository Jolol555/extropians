What this have to do with Tianamen?

<i>&gt;whether it would be useful to a military campaign or not. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Clearly, that premise is false.</i><br>

<p>
If by civilian targets you mean some sort of apartment building
that is clearly not a valid target. Now lets take a real world
example. After some of the initial bombing in Japan WWII it became
apparent that a large portion of the Japanese military-industrial
complex was cottage based, "a drill press in every home". This was
used to support the massive firebombing raids, which killed many
more than the 2 A-bombs. A famous photo taken after one of these
events showed a large area burnt to the ground, every dozen or so
yards/meters apart there stood a drill press or other machine.
Justified?

<p>
<a href="4700.html#4735qlink6">&gt;There may be legitimate military reasons to bomb civilian targets,</a><br>
<i>&gt;even if innocent people die as a result.  But the US has a</i><br>
<i>&gt;sufficiently powerful military to make avoiding blowing up</i><br>
<i>&gt;civilians a reasonable goal, and I think that's commendable.</i><br>

<p>
We do avoid it, but power stations, water works, bridges, train
tracks, etc are all valid targets.
