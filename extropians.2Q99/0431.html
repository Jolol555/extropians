Obviously, a lot of people liked the movie a lot more than I did.  
I have no objection to a little escapist fantasy.  I was reacting 
instead to the idea suggested that we should talk about this movie,
as a way of helping us to understand the transhuman/extropian 
topics we commonly discuss.  

<p>
I still see nothing useful to talk about among ourselves, nor do I see
how referring to the movie would help me in talking to others.  The
movie might be a nice backdrop to "brain in a vat" discussions in intro
philosophy courses.  But I don't consider the possible "unreality of 
reality" a very interesting or important concept, esp. re transhumans.

<p>
<a name="0439qlink1">So I'm still mystified by what the exciting ideas in Matrix are.
Maybe I've assimilated those ideas too deeply to notice them.</a>
