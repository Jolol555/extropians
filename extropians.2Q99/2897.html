Concentrated power is a great thing - but military hardware is not often
the most efficient thing around - it's more important to get the power
quickly than cheaply..

<p>
The only radioactive 'batteries I know of are either thermionic or collect
beta particles (very low current at a few thousand volts). Is this
something new?</a>

<p>
Far as I know, Carnot engines are the at the theoretical maximum efficency
- and in the real world cannot be produced. Some turbine cycles come close,
though.

<p>
All automotive engines currently in production use the Diesel or Otto
cycles - both are much less efficient that Carnot - and the best ceramic
Diesels I have read of are around 30% efficient. These were made by Ford
for the Army, and had no cooling system other than radiation from the
cylinders, which ran at red heat. Hardly a low IR signature</a> power
source...but then I have never sean a 'stealthy' tank...

<p>
The gear box in a well designed car is better than 80 percent efficient,
and rolling friction has been dropping steadily with new tire designs. Some
body designs have extremely low drag coefficients at normal highway speeds
- the reason most new cars look like rolling turds - that shape cuts the
air best. The 14% overall fuel efficiency I can believe for a gasoline
powered car, but 30-45% seems way too low for electric, unless you are
figuring in lots of power accessories. When you say 'all told' are you
including power generation and trarnsport losses?
