<p>
Meditators have been the subjects of study for thousands of years. Extropic
meditation creates hyper-cognitive tranquility, while the body rests.  The
technique requires nothing more than a knack for making yourself very alert
while letting all thoughts fade away. What you find by doing this, which
involves turning your back on the mythology generated by our social order,
is so profound that you must share it (presumptuous or not) because it
indicts the word-manipulated mass of humanity and demands civil
disobedience, which means living in harmony with our inner, heroic nature
and not according to the intimidation and demands of ideology.

<p>
Rediscovering your natural, organic sovereignty by stripping away the false
programming of organized policy, abandoning belief systems, embarking on a
path of honest observation, sincere investigation, and choiceless awareness,
means meditation. Obviously you have to do this by yourself, no one can do
it for you. The idea that anyone can give you this experience is as absurd
as imagining that someone else can take a bath for you. As Kabir (and a
bunch of others) has said, "All that is essential is direct experience."
Meditation takes you from sex to superconsciousness, from sleep to total
awareness. Share the way.

Cheers,
