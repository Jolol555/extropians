  Metallurgy Magic

Microsope and Mathematics Put Atomic Theories to the Test 

<p>

<br>
April 23 — For centuries people have tried to strengthen metals by 
combining them: creating alloys of two or more metals in hopes of 
producing a stronger, lighter and more malleable material. 
<p>
     Until now that process has proceeded by trial and error, though 
there have been notable successes, like the titanium-aluminium alloys 
used in the hulls of airplanes. But what if scientists could develop 
a mathematical model for creating the strongest, lightest alloys 
possible? 
<br>
The electron microscope at Johns Hopkins sends a stream of electrons 
through an atom and then through a prism filter. By measuring the 
differences in how the electrons react, researchers can identify the 
atom in question. Click on the interactive box to see a history of 
the microscope's development. (ABCNEWS.com) 
 

<p>
     Using a new electron microscope, researchers at Johns Hopkins 
University in Baltimore and at Northwestern University in Chicago are 
studying how individual atoms in an alloy are connected, and how 
those connections change when the metal is bent and shaped. With that 
information they may be able to develop just such a mathematical 
model for the creation of alloys. 
<br>
Every Atom in Its Place
<br>
Under a grant from the U.S. Air Force, the two universities are 
working on new materials for eventual use in fighter jets and other 
aircraft.

<p>
     The first step, according to Johns Hopkins researcher Kevin 
Hemker, is to identify the atoms and their crystalline connections 
within the alloy. To do that, Hemker’s team uses an electron 
microscope with a field-emission gun, developed by Philips Electron 
Optics. 
<p>
     There are no more than two dozen electron microscopes in the 
country, Hemker points out. “It’s the field-emission gun that makes 
this one special.” 
<p>
     The gun sends an extremely narrow beam of electrons — less than 
a nanometer (one billionth of a meter) across — through a single atom 
and then through a prism. The electrons that pass through the atom 
are slowed considerably. When the electrons then pass through the 
prism, the paths of the slower electrons are altered much more than 
the paths of those that did not pass through the atom. By measuring 
those changes, the team can identify the atom under examination. 

<p>
Clashing Crystals
<br>
The next step is to study how those atoms arrange themselves into 
crystals, and how those crystals interact when the metal is bent and 
shaped into objects. Bending an object causes defects in the crystals 
called “dislocations” to occur. Those dislocations are difficult to 
correct. 
<p>
     “Think of a coat hanger,” Hemker says. “When you bend it, it’s 
relatively easy. But try to bend it back into the shape it held 
before. That’s a lot harder, and that’s because the atoms were packed 
tighter around where you bent it, and aren’t as willing to bend 
back.” 
<p>
     The John Hopkins team plans to study different alloys — aluminumtitanium
 and copper-gold, for example — to see not only how they’re 
formed on an atomic level, but how their atomic structures are 
affected when the material is bent. 

<p>
Mathematics and Metallurgy
<br>
Identifying and altering individual atoms in an alloy crystal is one 
thing — figuring out what to do with the information is something 
else. That’s where the Materials Research Center at Northwestern 
comes in. 
<p>
     A team of researchers led by physics professor Art Freeman has 
been preparing mathematical computer models of different alloys, to 
show how distortions rearrange the crystalline latticework of atoms. 
Using mathematical values for each alloy, they will then compare 
those findings with Hemker’s results. 
<p>
     “If they agree with our predictions, we say ‘A-ha!,’ the theory 
is really developed and is on the right track,” says Freeman. “If 
not, we have to go back and find out which assumptions were 
incorrect.” 
<p>
     In the end, they are hoping to create a purely mathematical 
system to determine which atoms would make the best alloys. In this 
way, Hemker says, the trial-and-error metallurgy of centuries past 
could give way to computer simulations of new and promising alloys. 
<p>
     “We would be able to see how any element, introduced into an 
alloy structure, would change it.” 
<p>
     With millions of possible combinations, scientists eventually 
hope to find the perfect alloy — stronger than steel, lighter than 
down.

A powerful new electron microscope and some new mathematical models 
may aid researchers in the quest for the ultimate alloy.

really developed and is on the right track. If not, we have to go 
back and find out which assumptions were incorrect.”
