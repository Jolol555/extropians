<a name="4068qlink1">It depends on the size of the protein sequence that you want, for small
peptides like less then 50 amino acid residues it's very efficient to
synthesize them chemically. You can get gram quanities of peptide after
purification, on the other hand if you want to make a fifty thousand dalton
protein that is about 500 amino acid residues then you have to express it in
a biological system. There are many different vectors to use in biological
expression and yields vary enormously for different proteins, and you almost
always have to do a lot of purification. So it depends on how big a gene,
which protein, how much you need, if you need it over and over again, and
how much work this particular protein is to purify.
