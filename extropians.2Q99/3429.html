<p>
You are exactly correct.  You probably didn't see my entire post, because
that was my conclusion as well.  The statistics showed that those with
concealed carry permits rarely committed crimes, but the interpretation of
the study was claiming that guns obtained legally by these people therefore
aren't being used in crimes.

<p>
It seems obvious to me that many criminals steal the guns they use, and many
child-shooting accidents are with someone else's gun.
