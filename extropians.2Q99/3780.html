The biggest problem there, as I see, is fitting macro objects into
micro-volumes.

<p>
But why do we want to send macro-objects, in the first place?
If we just want to have them on the other side, there may be other
options.
<br>
One: if the destination has sufficient intelligence, just send
them a stream of FTL information packets with instructions how
to assemble the needed object, and an acceptable security assurance
and payment protocols.
<br>
Two: if the recipient site is not intelligent enough, send the minimal
data sufficient for building a bootstrapping core for the desired
object, and then rely on this core for further construction and negotiation
with the locals.

<p>
If the recipient site is absolutely dumb, you may have to send a larger-
oscopic GenericBootstrappingCore there, which can take some effort.
Hopefully, after a little while, the Universe will be covered with a grid
of intelligent recipients, and this problem will no longer arise; all new
universes can be constructed that way too. (Maybe, ours already was?)

<p>
Finally, we are left with the problem of a functional object confined in
a specific material carrier that cannot be separated from it for vanity
(original art work),  engineering (a human) or identity-perception
reasons.  These issues should be largely resolved by the time the
FTL communication system is launched, and should certainly not be
a problem for any agencies worth of possessing such technology  :-)
