<a name="2844qlink1"><a href="2801.html#2841qlink1">&gt;Is this a serious requests for references on the &gt;genetic influence of </a><br>
<i>&gt;human</i><br>
<i>&gt;performance? [the list is BIG] Or are you asserting &gt;that there is "NO"</i><br>
<i>&gt;gentic differentiation?</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would question the word "most" in the previous &gt;reply,however.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2895qlink1"><a name="2859qlink1">     I have read various articles about intelligence which favor genetics 
and others which favor environment as the larger cause for whether a person 
is intelligent or creative or not. Personally, I think that as long as 
genetics has provided you with a working brain, that the rest is pretty much 
</a>
<a name="2844qlink2">up to you. A favorable, stimulating environment helps, but the lack of such 
can be made up</a> for.

<p>
<a name="2911qlink1">     No one in my family is anywhere near as intelligent or creative as I 
am. I am pretty sure that I was not switched at the hospital, so unless</a> I am 
<a name="2844qlink3">a throwback to some forgotten genius in the mists of my family's ancient 
history, I figure that I did not INHERIT my intellect. Likewise, the 
environment that I grew up in was very far from encouraging.
</a>

<p>
<a name="2911qlink2">     As a very small child, my earliest perception about myself and others 
was of a fundamental difference. It was "intelligence" (even if I did not 
yet know the word, I had the feeling of it). I consciously took on the 
purpose and ambition of enhancing this difference. As a child, this meant 
study, greedily taking in whatever knowledge that I could get.</a> As I got 
older, I started to think more about intelligence itself: clear and 
efficient perception, cognition and communication. So, from then to now, I 
have played around with memory improvement, semantics, creativity 
enhancement, brain nutrition and so on.
</a>

<p>
     Anyway, the point of this biography is that my intellect is a product 
of neither my genes nor my environment. That is even more true</a> for my 
aesthetics, values and purposes. I may be very rare in this; but certainly 
not unique. I would rank genetics as the least important factor, then 
environment and then self-determinism as the most important factor of all.

<p>
     With equal "evidence" available to support seemingly contradictory 
theories, I look to my own experience. Of course, if geneticists can grow a 
"better" brain, that would certainly make a difference.
