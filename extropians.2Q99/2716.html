  <li>  4 June is not all of 4 June, but up till when I wrote this post.

These coarse criteria have missed a lot of posts on the same (futile)
subjects. But the signal to noise is getting worse: I think that the
signal to noise is getting worse too.

<p>
Now I'm all for noise, otherwise I'd be mute. However, this is getting
too horrible and dull: as much as I love a bit of abuse between two
strangers (who will forget the first appearance of "fucking nimrod"</a> in
the guns posts) even I can't get excited by the guns messages anymore.

<a name="2748qlink1">I'm using the following scan for interesting posts:

<p>
Anything by Gina Miller
<br>
Anything by Anders
<br>
Anything by Eliezer
<br>
Anything by Damien Broderick (come on aussie)
Anthing by anyone that I know/suspect has written a book (includes most
og the above?)
<br>
And anyone who puts up interesting ideas (Jeff Davis? All the people who
put abstracts / links to websites up), lots of others, sorry to leave
you all out).
<br>
Subjects that don't have "re:" on the front
messages in a thread (ie: re) for which the original message I read from
above.
<br>
Or anything which catches my eye as I (very quickly) skip over the rest.
