<a name="3291qlink1"><i>&gt; If you can't show any intellectual integrity or honesty, please stop debating. For that matter,</i><br>
<i>&gt; where are all the manslaughters???? If you don't include those important deaths, what is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; purpose of your statistics unless they are outright lies? A homicide is not a murder, and a</i><br>
<a href="3183.html#3220qlink1">&gt; justified homicide is not a negligent homicide, which is also missing. Also keep in mind that</a><br>
<i>&gt; many jurisdictions do not call self defense a justifiable reason to kill someone, there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousands of abused wives in prison for 'murdering' their abusive spouses.</i><br>

<p>
The average murderer only serves 7 years.  But then you look at some of the people who get life in
prison-no possibility of parole, and you find cases where respectable men ended up resorting to the
use of violence after the police refused to do anything.  Men who act out of the desire to protect
their wives and children.

<p>
The hostility of government officials towards the idea of people being allowed to protect themselves
is quite clear.
