<a name="1624qlink1"><a name="1597qlink1"><a name="1569qlink1"><a name="1566qlink1"><a name="1565qlink1">In many science-fiction novels, psychoses and neuroses are presented</a> as a 
</a>
things of the past, and the humans of the future are shown to be much more 
sane and psychologically balanced than those of today.

<p>
<a name="1624qlink2"><a name="1569qlink2">Has any good novel ever tried to envision what a psychotherapy</a> of the future 
</a>
would look like, or what conditions would make this general increase in 
sanity possible?</a></a>
</a>

<p>
I remember being fascinated by Van Vogt's "World of A", and the idea that a 
kind of mental discipline (in this case, general semantics) could make people 
much more rational, psychologically healthy and even intelligent than the 
average individual. This led me to read Korzybski's "Science and Sanity" in 
my late teens and subscribe to the periodical of the general semantics 
society.

<p>
My infatuation with this movement soon subsided, but I have retained the 
ideal of such a mental panacea.

<p>
<a name="1549qlink1">Has such a preventive psychiatry been depicted in science-fiction,</a> or has any 
current psychologist tried to develop one?

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
