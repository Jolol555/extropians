<i>&gt; technology used by the government, your employer, and your health</i><br>
<i>&gt; insurance company, everything you post on the Internet *is* forever.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; really don't expect it to be all *that* long before somebody can run</i><br>
<i>&gt; automated searches like "Has my inner geek ever done anything illegal?"</i><br>

There has to be someone who wants to look as well, and there is
some societal pressure against this.  I've had an essay about
hiring a prostitute on my web site for years, and the URL of my
web site is on my resume.  No employer has ever brought it up.
I've made statements that are probably seditious more than once.
Even before the internet, if someone wanted to find something
incriminating about you, they probably could.  If people whose
ethics differ from mine want to avoid me because of what I have
said or done, that's fine with me.  I've found that most people
who are only interested in trade don't care to look,</a> and those
who do look are probably friends, likely to agree with me.
