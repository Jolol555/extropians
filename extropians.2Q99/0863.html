<a href="0842.html#0863qlink1">&gt;&gt; I don't know that "bond-strenghtening" between couples can really be</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; achieved without sex, at least not at this point. I know of several</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; relationships that were severely harmed by lack of sexual activity...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &lt;snipt&gt;...Humans connect sex with emotional</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; intimacy, and that intimacy is what keeps a relationship going.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What about situations where one develops a totally unreasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt;crush on another person?</i><br>

<p>
A one-way unreasonable crush is in my opinion not a healthy or meaningful
relationship.

<p>
<i>&gt;Or what about those situations where intimacy</i><br>
<a href="0842.html#0863qlink2">&gt;*would have* evolved, except that one or both are sexually unavailable for</a><br>
<i>&gt;whatever reason, such as, one or both are already married to others?</i><br>
<i>&gt;These can  be deep, meaningful relationships that may even last for many</i><br>
<i>&gt;years, but never have the sexual context.</i><br>

<p>
That's why I tried to specifiy that sex was important to maintaining a
marriage-style relationship and keeping it from devolving into a close
friendship. That's not at all to imply that close friendships are not deep
or meaningful, but they're not the same thing as marriage.
