Thanks for the kind comments on my book, Emlyn.

This is the very chapter that most offended James Bradley in his *Age*
review, who found it evidence of a `deep-seated intellectual intolerance'.
Of New Age drivel?  Yessir, your Honor, guilty as charged!

I feel that way, too, but there's an option for the old - not a very good
one yet, I suspect, but it's there: cryonic suspension.  And if they don't
know about it because nobody's bothered to inform them, they'll die
permanently.  What a waste.  (That said, I'm not signed up for freezing
myself.  Shocking evasion.)</a>

I'm a comparatively old fart, and my sister is married to a guy in his 70s.
 The sooner we decrepit old dogs shake a leg and insist on work being done
in longevity and cryostasis research, the better chance everyone will have
of living a decent length of time, like at least a few thousand years.
Being embarrassed to raise the topic isn't going to make death go away.
