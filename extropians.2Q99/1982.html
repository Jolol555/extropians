<a name="1992qlink1"><a href="1942.html#1982qlink1">&gt;I'm probably going to provoke more rancid vitriol and get shot</a><br>
<i>&gt;down in flames for saying this, but just because something is</i><br>
<i>&gt;written in your precious constitution or your bill of rights does</i><br>
<i>&gt;not mean that it is the be all and end all,...</i><br>

<p>
Check the archives; I think you will find that none of us (or
perhaps one) is using the Constitution as a /reason/ to support
freedom.  That would indeed be irrational.  Laws are just paper,
and the Constitution is no different.  I certainly respect that
document, and will use it to my advantage against the forces
of evil when I can, but I do not make decisions based on it.
My decisions are based on mt own judgment of right and wrong,
and what works and what doesn't.  Self-defense is a fundamental
human right--and duty.  Guns are an appropriate technology of
the day for accomplishing that.  When newer technologies come
along, I'll fight for the freedom to use those too, and I'm
sure that Goo Control International will fight against me.</a>
Gun control laws are a miserable failure by any measure; one
doesn't need the Constitution to show that.
