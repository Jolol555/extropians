<p>
Yes, and was this a bad thing?
 
<p>
<a name="4408qlink3"><a href="4324.html#4395qlink3">&gt; I consider Lincoln to be extremely non-extropian in his actions.</a><br>

Uh, oh -- I think I detect the embroyo of a thought police here.</a>

<a name="4409qlink1"><a name="4408qlink4">Here's a question I have for the group:  does "extropian" necessarily
mean "libertarian"?  I read your extropian manifesto, and in section
5 (politics) it seemed like a pretty good description of the old US.
I am inclined to be libertarian, when I am not thinking.  But then I
come to my senses, and realize that this world is full of way too many
would-be oppressors in every possible form (especially economic) for
any form of pure libertarianism to work.</a>
