From: KPJ &lt;kpj@sics.se&gt;

<p>
<a href="0247.html#0295qlink1">&gt;Just pointing out that (a) one cannot overthrow a government which</a><br>
<i>&gt;has nuclear capability with puny guns, </i><br>

<p>
Sure you can, sometimes you don't even have to, it collapses under
it's own weight. (former USSR) Even nukes won't stop a citizen
army.

<p>
<a href="0247.html#0295qlink2">&gt;(b) the use of weapons in urban survival combat does not appear to</a><br>
<i>&gt;be purpose of the 2nd amendment, and </i><br>

<p>
Of course it is, actually it guarantees your right to defend
yourself, and in conjunction with your neighbors, the country.


<p>
<a href="0247.html#0295qlink3">&gt;(c) the 2nd amendment would seem to refer to a militia and not to</a><br>
<i>&gt;individuals as such.</i><br>

<p>
Nonsense, it was crap like this that started the militia movement.
The 2nd Amendment correctly points out the only defense lies in
armed citizens acting together. The militia is divided (by law)
into two parts, the regulated militia, (the armed forces) and the
unregulated militia, every able bodied male (this should be amended
to read "person") over 17. (the armed citizen) this is defined:

<p>
10 USC Sec 311 Composition and classes
<br>
10 USC Sec 312 Militia duty: exemptions
<br>
32 USC Sec 313 appended to 10 USC 311

<p>
Read the Federalist papers, the founding fathers intended for the
average citizen to be armed, and armed with the equivalent of
anything the military had.

<p>
<a href="0247.html#0295qlink4">&gt;And thus the peace broke out.</a><br>

<p>
Try telling this to the inhabitants of Kosovo...

<p>
I mean the former inhabitants.....

<p>
I mean the former inhabitants that are still alive...
