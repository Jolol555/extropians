<a href="0023.html#0027qlink1">&gt;Sure. But is memetics elementary science? I'm not so sure, it is a</a><br>
<i>&gt;concept that right now is not very widely known (but infecting people</i><br>
<i>&gt;at a rising rate :-).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As others have noticed, what we might need is a better FAQ system. Or</i><br>
<i>&gt;maybe a transhumanist encyclopedia.</i><br>


<p>
Questions about memetics or any other topic that hasn't been mainstreamed
yet don't annoy me, but those about the basic properties of gasses (~7th
grade Science in the U.S.), the expansion of the Universe, the Big Bang
Theory, and the concept of a scientific theory itself (~ 9th grade Science)
do.  All this information is also freely available on the web in numerous
places.  I taught high school science for a year and some of the questions
being asked are beneath the level of what my students knew before I got a
hold of them.

<p>
I wholeheartedly agree that newbies do need a set of resources from which to
glean information.  I used Anders' as well as others sites as a primary
resource some 5 years ago when I first became aware of Extropy.  Maybe it is
time for a revamping and reorganization of the collected knowledge (and I
would love to see the brilliant minds here work together on a project).  I'm
working on a site in my own field (life extension) and will make it
available as soon as it is presentable.
