<a href="0631.html#0651qlink1">&gt;How long do you all think marriages will last in a world where everyone is</a><br>

<a name="0657qlink7">I think a lot of people stay in loveless relationships as they</a> get older
<a name="0657qlink8">because they think "what the hell, one of us will die soon enough".
Which leads to the same kind of dilemma in the context</a> of agelessness,
<a name="0657qlink9">and I wonder how people will resolve it.

<p>
<a name="0681qlink1">Similarly with jobs. I think that a lot of people work their 40+</a> years
<a name="0657qlink10">in a career happy to know that it will come to an end</a> in some imaginable
<a name="0657qlink11">period of time: I'd say a lot of (or most) people don't like their
career, or to put it another way, if they were idependently wealthy,
they'd stop working. Try telling them that they're ageless now,</a> and the
<a name="0657qlink12">retirement age has moved to 400, or 800, or 100,000, or never. 
</a>

<p>
Hopefully they'll quit, and do something interesting. Go surfing?</a> Start
<a name="0657qlink13">building Transhuman AIs?

<p>
There are some excellent, and very difficult changes to come from
extended life.
