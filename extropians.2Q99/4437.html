Wimps.

<p>
My theory is based on the fact that 4 year old girls are very good liars.  Most
girls have it figured out by that age that if they look cute and say the right
things, that they will be rewarded.  And they develop the ability to tune into
what "everybody knows", instead of the ability to think for themselves (which
can get them into trouble).  And they learn that as long as they have good
intentions, they can get away with anything. So at a very early age they develop
strategies that are very successful, and this causes them to experience arrested
intellectual development.

<p>
I was a lot more intelligent than he was!!!  But their seems to be a common
belief that if you have a brain, that you can't have feelings too.  I.E. if you
have a brain, you can't possibly be a 'real' women.

<p>
Well, I may hide my feelings, or express them in poetry.  Instead of using them
to get my way, like so many female types do.  But I definitely have feelings,
emotions, a maternal instinct,<a name="4474qlink1"> and a sex drive.
