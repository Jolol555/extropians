with a 42-year-old girlfriend who can (and happily does) screw me
into a stupor several times in a day.</a>

<a name="4668qlink2">I *don't* see this as a problem at all.</a>

<p>
<a name="4668qlink3">Just think of it as good sweaty fun noisy exercise that will extend
your life- very extropian indeed.  What you probably need is better
sex, not less</a> ;)

<p>
<a name="4668qlink4">As for not siring more kids, just get a vasectomy as I did a little
while ago- just keep the icepacks on there for a few days and you'll
do fine...</a>
