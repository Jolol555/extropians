Not only has it been duplicated, but there are people who can tell you where
&amp; when a particular sample was made, and which exact technique was used.  It
was based on a moderately-sophisticated steelmaking technique that
professional metallurgists usually learn about in college, so anyone who is
really knowledgeable in the field should be able to give you all the details
you want.
