<a name="1917qlink1"><a href="1911.html#1915qlink1">&gt; I'm arguing for laws to keep guns out of the hands of immature</a><br>
<i>&gt; and sociopathic people, many of which will NOT become KILLERS</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a result!  For you to rail against that is fucking irresponsible.</i><br>

...or maybe it's just evidence that he has sufficient IQ to know
that laws are just words, and won't prevent someone from becoming
a killer any more than "Just say no" ended the drug problem.
I could as easily argue that for you to propose laws without any
evidence that those laws will protect more people than they harm
is also criminally irresponsible.</a>

<a name="1917qlink2">I, like most who support the right to use appropriate defense
technologies, am most enraged by the suggestion that we somehow
approve of their misuse, or don't want to reduce their misuse.
Continuing to imply that we do is willfully dishonest, and will
not help your arguments.  Continuing to argue about motives is
a waste of time.</a>

they show that they are able to argue rationally and honestly.</a>
