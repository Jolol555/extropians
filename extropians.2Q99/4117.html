Sounds good, but atoms are old-school. Many of us here have
high speed net connections, and in 5 years probably 90% of
us will. Make the videos available direct from the ExI web
site on demand. Does Real Networks or Broadcast.com give
any breaks to non-profits?

<a href="4110.html#4117qlink1">&gt; Dear Max,</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I know you're busy so I won't engage in a lot of chit chat.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I went to Extro 3.  Couldn't afford the whole cost, but with the help of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the lovely Natasha, I paid some, and manned the front table in exchange for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rest.  Among the most enjoyable occasions of my life.  I thought then,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as i do now, that it should have been available to the larger audience</i><br>
<i>&gt; waiting in front of their tv's for something worth watching--something to</i><br>
<i>&gt; get excited about.  And here you are about to go at it again.  But this</i><br>
<i>&gt; time I'm ahead of the action, able to make my suggestion when something can</i><br>
<i>&gt; still be done about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, I am all but absolutely certain that you've covered this ground</i><br>
<i>&gt; already.  How could it be otherwise?  It's so obvious.  Yet I have never</i><br>
<i>&gt; heard, vis a vis tv offerings (though I have no great knowledge of tv</i><br>
<i>&gt; offerings), nor on the extropians list, of a cable or videotape offering of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the extro 3, nanotech, transvision, or other conference, of whatever sort.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (I remember from extro 3 that there were people there taping the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; event, so I "know" the materials exist.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So I see two or three ways to go here--by the way, I fully expect that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; recording quality of the extro 3 tapes, and other sub-professionally</i><br>
<i>&gt; recorded events, and the sound quality, probably don't come close to</i><br>
<i>&gt; "broadcast" quality, and that post-production clean-up is likely to be both</i><br>
<i>&gt; expensive and of limited benefit; nevertheless, you have the "finished"</i><br>
<i>&gt; product there in the can, ready to go. A kind of freebie ready to be turned</i><br>
<i>&gt; into money,...er, revenue.--</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. Get someone to market Extro 4 for you, on cable and on tape.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2. Get someone to market a broad range of conferences, including ours (If</i><br>
<i>&gt; I maybe so bold as to consider myself one of the family.) as a niche market</i><br>
<i>&gt; cable/videotape offering,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; or</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3. Initiate an extropian business enterprise, and do it ourselves.  Re this</i><br>
<i>&gt; last consider:  If we are entering "the information age", then being a</i><br>
<i>&gt; collector and distributor of information should, by definition, be</i><br>
<i>&gt; economically viable, if not lucrative.  The kind of information that comes</i><br>
<i>&gt; from conferences is--I'll stick my neck out on this on--high quality, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; not currently considered for broadcast because of--I'm guessing again--low</i><br>
<i>&gt; demand and sub-broadcast-standard production values.  But shortly, when</i><br>
<i>&gt; access to such materials (full bandwidth video) becomes possible on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; internet, demand should be higher and production values less of an issue.</i><br>
<i>&gt; At which time, an inventory of product and an established position in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; marketplace makes you a player.  There are lots of high tech conferences</i><br>
<i>&gt; out there that the world is hungry for but can't afford to attend.  When,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in short order, the filaments of the net connect to that hunger (if not</i><br>
<i>&gt; already) you have a happening thing.  (Someone might suggest that those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be interested could, as they do now, get their info by reading the</i><br>
<i>&gt; conference proceedings.  But I would suggest that a human narrated</i><br>
<i>&gt; treatment clearly is richer and greatly broadens the audience.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Meanwhile, a cable tv, videotape, and --how could I have overlooked it--</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Conferences on CD"  distribution enterprise seems a ripe extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt; enterprise.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm willing to help.  And I'm here in the Bay Area.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; Is Transvision 99 on tape?</i><br>

<i>&gt;                         Best, Jeff Davis</i><br>
