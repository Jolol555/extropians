<a name="1610qlink1">We can do better than that.  How about sonar-based vision?  Distribute a
network of sensors through your clothing (or skin, with better tech), and
you can easily collect enough data for that.  You don't even need an
emitter - you can use background noise as 'illumination', if you have enough
computer power.

<p>
Map the results onto your visual field, and you gain the ability to see
through solid matter.  You could use color coding to indicate physical
properties of what you are looking at (density &amp; rigidity are pretty easy to
measure this way).

How about a general visualization enhancement?  Set it up so that when you
picture something in your mind the data is interpreted by a computer, which
stores it in memory and echoes it back to you.  As you imagine more details
the computer adds them to the existing model, and when you shift your mental
viewpoint it echoes back the appropriate data.  If you can get the feedback
to work right this could vastly improve your ability to visualize complex
objects - a very useful ability for engineers, artists and VR designers.
