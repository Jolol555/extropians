<p>
Just adding my two cents...

<p>
Unlike Mike Linksvayer, I don't have access to various science news
pages and mailing lists.  Hence Gina's forwarding of news stories is of
great value to me.

<p>
Have people forgotten how to use the 'delete' key?  A few taps, and the
'noise' is gone.

<p>
I support the earlier call for people to write more considered articles,
but I would rather have 'noise' than people intimidated into not sharing
their views.  The 'gun' problem could have been resolved if the
participants had shown more consideration and made it a private e-mail
war, rather than a public one.  Many gun postings were merely smart-arse
retorts which had no place on any mailing list.

<p>
Just some thoughts...
