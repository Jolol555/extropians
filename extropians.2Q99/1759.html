<p>
Similiar to distributed.net, seti@home now allows creation of 
competing teams <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/team.html">http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/team.html</a> ,
a distinctly motivating factor.

The disparity between work units sent and results received indicates
that the joins have not saturated yet. Somehow, I think the creators
of the project have never anticipated such a resonance ;)

<p>
Though it is difficult to imagine a project more motivating to the
public than SETI an ALife project akin to 
<a href="http://www.hip.atr.co.jp/~ray/tierra/netreport/netreport.html">http://www.hip.atr.co.jp/~ray/tierra/netreport/netreport.html</a>
could come close, especially if providing stunning visuals.

<p>
As the rollout of xDSL continues, the local density of potential project
participants connected with low-latency ~1 Mbps might become
supercritical for really worthwhile projects. JITed Java performance
is apparently at the threshold of becoming comparable to true compiled
languages. Creating a distributed GA for the sake of finding a mutation
function capable of mutating Java VM opcodes robustly would be
obviously extremely worthile. Searches of integer 3d CA rule space would
be that as well, and simultaneously guarantee a rich source of visuals.

<p>
Of course one could also think about writing a code GA searching for
constructive IP stack buffer overruns, and applying just-discovered
exploits immediately... &gt;;)
