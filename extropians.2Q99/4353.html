I, like the original poster, also hold Lincoln in a very negative light.

Unfortunately, history has once again been written by the victor.  Abraham
Lincoln was one of the first major steps away from the Jeffersonian ideal
that the American government was founded on.  His history exists as more of
a cultural myth than anything else.
