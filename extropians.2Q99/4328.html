<a name="4335qlink1">I submit that your pattern-model will not occur without a causal-model brain
actually running the consciousness programming and creating the patterns for
the pattern-model brain.</a>  This was my objection to the examples.  The
disjointed neurons being fired in a pattern are being forced into this
pattern by the causal-model brains.  The patterns are *caused* by the
causal-model brains.  The sequence from one pattern to the next is *caused*
by the causal-model brains.  Random patterns of bits can't rearrange
themselves to form a coherent stream of consciousness unless there is a
causal-model brain running, either in a human brain or on a mechanical
computer CPU.  Disks drives that have patterns of bits, or screen displays
with patterns of bits cannot have a stream of data that responds or reacts
except as directed by the causal-model brain.

<p>
<a name="4335qlink2">Your so-called pattern-model for consciousness is merely a snapshot of a
causal-model brain at a specific moment in time.  Your series of programmed
patterns is merely an animated picture of a brain working.  It is not a
functional brain by itself.  It can never input data and react.  It can
never do anything other than replay the pattern that is being animated.  It
is a movie of a brain being conscious, so it looks very much like a brain
being conscious, but it fails any Turing Test.  Ask the film a question.  It
can't answer until the causal brain makes a new film of a brain giving the
answer.  Then, when that film is played back, it will appear that the
pattern brain has answered.  The pattern-brain cannot meet the definitions
of life or consciousness without having a causal-model brain standing</a> in for
it.
