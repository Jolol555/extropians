If Harold Schwartz, accountant from St. Paul, was sufficiently inspiring in his college speeches to get earnest young university volunteers to work for his election, sufficiently politically adept to get a third party nomination and wangle that status and his grassroots-cultivated support into participation in the debates, and sufficiently articulate and reasonable sounding to win them (many eventual voters watch them regardless of the number of participants), you'd be calling him Gov. Harold Schwartz.
