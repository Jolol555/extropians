Indeed; looking at the historical data Britain and America both had similar
murder rates when both had similar gun laws, since then Britain's murder
rate has gone up and down, while America's grew dramatically at the
beginning of Prohibition, dropped about 50% with the end of Prohibition,
and grew again with the War On Some Drugs.
