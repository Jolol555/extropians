<a name="1318qlink1">I think it's more appropriate to think in terms
of using an overall strategy for dealing</a> with the
IRS.

<p>
<a name="1318qlink2">An arsenal of "weapons" is available to do this.
The 5th Amendment is one of these weapons. "Weapons"
are available to effectively deal with all the
issues you raise below.</a>

<p>
What weapons you decide to use is a question of
strategy. How you use any particular weapon is
probably best thought of as tactics.

<p>
As an individual you have a basic choice: (a) Blind
obedience to the entropic IRS system resulting in
your financing a wide range of political entropic
behaviors; or (b) Searching for ways to behave more
extropically in relation to the IRS system.

<p>
The first decision may be to decide whether it's
worthwhile to invest some time in "searching."
For example, if you're currently entropically
paying the IRS $10,000 a year, your "searching"
may result in your not having to pay that money
-- without your incurring significant entropic
personal risk.

help you determine whether "searching" is
potentially worthwhile or not.

<i>&gt;&gt; At a meeting held in Tulsa the evening of Tuesday, May 4,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Springer distributed a short paragraph people should provide</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to anyone asking them to file State or Federal income tax</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; returns, the paragraph supposedly constructed by an attorney</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in the Department of Justice.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The problem with this strategy is that it reinforces a right everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;already has.  No one is compelled to file their tax return or sign it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Everyone is "free" to not comply with the Internal Revenue Code.  However,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the IRS and the Department of Treasury are empowered to invoke the</i><br>
<i>&gt;provisions of the IRC (including 'late filing' penalties, 'lack of filing'</i><br>
<i>&gt;penalties, 'nonpayment' penalties, and interest on all of these penalties</i><br>
<i>&gt;and on taxes owed).  Additionally, the law allows the IRS to place and</i><br>
<i>&gt;enforce liens against your property in order to collect taxes.  While this</i><br>
<i>&gt;strategy might get you out of contempt charges, it won't stop the IRS from</i><br>
<i>&gt;liquidating your assets.  Just because you aren't required attest to whether</i><br>
<i>&gt;or not you broke the law or to supply evidence that might incriminate you,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that does not eliminate the judicial remedies available to governmental</i><br>
<i>&gt;agencies or insulate you from them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The IRS can determine your tax liability without your help.  If they are so</i><br>
<i>&gt;inclined, they can fund a fairly invasive investigation.  If you work they</i><br>
<i>&gt;have 1099s to track your income.  If you are self-employed, your customers</i><br>
<i>&gt;must also supply 1099s for payments over certain amounts.  If you aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt;employed there is no tax liability to avoid in the first place.  If you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;not employed but have tons of bank accounts and securities that pay you</i><br>
<i>&gt;dividends and interest, the IRS receives 1099s for these amounts also.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The most cogent cases I've seen are the ones that attack the government's</i><br>
<i>&gt;authority to assess tax in the first place.  However, the Supreme Court has</i><br>
<i>&gt;discarded this argument in various vicissitudes several times.  The argument</i><br>
<i>&gt;is so inadequate now that it is the grounds for frivolous claims charges.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Finally, this DOJ employee, as well as yourself, should be careful spreading</i><br>
<i>&gt;this "strategy" about since to the extent someone relies on this strategy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;there could be vicarious liability issues for yourself and the DOJ employee.</i><br>
