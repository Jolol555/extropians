<a href="2205.html#2213qlink1">&gt; Hey, I think we might actually have a coherent and polite dialog</a><br>
<i>&gt; going on here... will wonders never cease?  :)</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; [Doug Jones wrote]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;  Several posters, including</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; myself, have raised the question of what standards of proof and due</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; process your concept would require.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That has never been before raised to my knowledge (post a past</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mail and prove me wrong), but any due process that any other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; purported offence is granted seems equitable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A few posts back, I wrote</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   I gather the impression that, unlike many "ban the gun" advocates,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   you don't mind gun ownership by non-felons, and you own weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt;   yourself.  Sadly it appears that most mass shooters are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;   convicted felons *at the time they commit their attacks*, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;   banning the possession of guns by _potential_ shooters would</i><br>
<i>&gt; require</i><br>
<i>&gt;   massive infringements of civil rights- for who can identify a</i><br>
<i>&gt;   potential shooter?  Psychological screening for firearms</i><br>
<i>&gt; purchases? </i><br>
<i>&gt;   The possibilities for political abuse of such a system would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;   large.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I must admit that I was putting up a bit of a strawman; the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; credible standard for restricting possession on "mental" grounds is</i><br>
<i>&gt; via due process in the courts, imperfect but the best we have.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On the other hand, some states' laws include "anyone ever committed</i><br>
<i>&gt; for mental observation", which could be abused if not kept in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; public eye.  The burden of proof should be on the regulatory agency,</i><br>
<i>&gt; of course, and I feel a commitment for observation should not in</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself be grounds for dispossession, since it is an investigatory</i><br>
<i>&gt; action, not a result of due process.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As with all things human, some dangerous people would not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; identified, while some actually harmless people might lose some</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights without due process.  The question moves to, "How effective</i><br>
<i>&gt; are these laws?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
We can only discover that in practice.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2205.html#2213qlink2">&gt; I misattributed this quote:</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;   "To support my point I state this:  The guy I was just referring</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;    to who stated he would rather kill a police officer (who most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;    likely has a wife and family) or other law enforcement officers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;    than have his gun taken away SHOULD have his license revoked</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;    for saying that and have his weapons taken away as he is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;    talking like a potential killer and is clearly a threat to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;    the general public from my perspective."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Ahh, the domino theory again!  First of all, I didn't write that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oops, my error.  I mistook Rick@cyborg.force9.net for you, probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; due to a similarity in your styles.  My apologies, I have no good</i><br>
<i>&gt; excuse, but it was an error, not a deliberate distortion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The legislation you seek is already in effect, for example in</i><br>
<i>&gt; California:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    POSSESSION</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    It is unlawful for anyone convicted of a felony, or who is</i><br>
<i>&gt;    a drug addict, present or former mental patient, ever committed</i><br>
<i>&gt;    for mental observation, or acquitted by reason of insanity to</i><br>
<i>&gt;    own or possess any firearm. People with certain misdemeanor</i><br>
<i>&gt;    convictions involving force or violence may not possess or own</i><br>
<i>&gt;    any firearm within 10 years of the conviction. A person who</i><br>
<i>&gt;    has been adjudicated as a juvenile offender or delinquent for</i><br>
<i>&gt;    any offense which would be classified as a felony or misdemeanor</i><br>
<i>&gt;    involving force or violence if committed by an adult may not</i><br>
<i>&gt;    own or possess any firearm until age 30. A minor may not possess</i><br>
<i>&gt;    a handgun except with written permission or under the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    supervision of a parent or guardian.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Another quibble with the above is the "drug addict" part- what</i><br>
<i>&gt; drugs, and what definition of addiction?  I'll have to look further,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but that's probably anyone who has signed up for a publicly funded</i><br>
<i>&gt; detox program, such as methadone maintenance.  If that's so, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; due process has kinda sorta been satisfied, but perhaps the</i><br>
<i>&gt; paperwork for voluntary drug treatment commitment should include the</i><br>
<i>&gt; warning that certain civil rights are signed away by that act.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A friend of mine in Colorado was a heroin addict twenty years ago,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but has been clean ever since then.  As it turns out, Colorado law</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not have a "drug addict" clause, so her possession of firearms</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and she protected *me* from assault once) is legal in Colorado.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt she'll move to California anytime soon though...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Exactly why I specified "violent criminal".  I do not believe that 
those who have committed nonviolent or victimless crimes such as 
marijuana use, homosexuality, gambling, prostitution, etc. should 
be deprived of their right to keep and bear.  I have never advocated 
their inclusion in such statutes.
<br>

<a href="2205.html#2213qlink3">&gt; -attribution corrected here-</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; [Rick] wants to disarm the man described above simply because</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; he *does  not want to be disarmed*, and is willing to fight</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; such oppression.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As long as the cops aren't banging down his door, there's no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; problem.  If he's a nut, kid or criminal, they SHOULD be taking his</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; gun away, and better that he die than some shnook on the street</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; who looks like a good target to him.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ok, you have a more reasonable position than Rick... and that</i><br>
<i>&gt; position is already law in many states.  Enforcement is a tough one,</i><br>
<i>&gt; though- the cops &amp; DAs are up to their eyeballs in this bloody</i><br>
<i>&gt; useless war on drugs (but that's a flamewar for another day &lt;grin&gt;).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I fully agree with you on that.
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2205.html#2213qlink4">&gt; &gt; &gt; Now do you see why some of us question your motives and goals?  Your</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking is a catch-22... you seem to be saying that as long as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; person doesn't mind being forcibly disarmed, he may (might?) keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; those arms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If they abrogate their rights by committing violent crimes, abusing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their spouses and/or children, developing legitimately certifiable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; psychoses, then they NEED to be disarmed, and the sooner the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; better.  If not, there's no problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Agreed, with rights come responsibilities.  Persons shown by due</i><br>
<i>&gt; process, on public record, to be in that set above are in most</i><br>
<i>&gt; jurisdictions in the US already banned from gun ownership.  Thus I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think we have little to truly disagree on.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
It also appears that way to me.
