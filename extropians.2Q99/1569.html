increase in sanity possible?"


<p>
Being blessed/cursed with mental illness myself (bipolar disorder),
sanity doesn't come as automatically for me as it seems to come for
others.  Having worked for years on becoming more sane, I have had to
take advantage of many forms of mental discipline to remain sane in spite
of pretty much always feeling like I am on some sort of psychedelic drug.

<p>
Learning how to focus deeply on the reality of the current moment has
been of immense help to me in my efforts to develop greater sanity. 
Engaging in lots of problem solving activities has also helped me develop
a feeling of confidence that none of my problems are insurmountable (so
that I don't give up on my own sanity).  Engaging in lots of
communication with others has helped me refine my thinking and has helped
me utilize the solutions that others have discovered to their own,
similar problems.  I try everything that I think will work, and I work to
improve all methods I try.

sanity must be developed and maintained
<br>
or it will inevitably be lost
