<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think changing personality is a quite valid transhumanist activity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Much of the philosophy really involves developing a positive,</i><br>

<p>
Hmmm... Putting it in these terms, I would tend to agree with you.

<a name="4698qlink1"><a href="4687.html#4691qlink11">&gt; So what is the different from getting a limbic implant which you</a><br>

<p>
While the decision may be a conscious one, the process itself would be
autonomic. Such a behavior-modification implant would not really involve any
true shift in personality, since (presumably) if it was removed one would
revert back to one's previous state.</a> I would still favor a slow and gradual
<a name="4698qlink2">process of change that actually addresses the root causes of the undesirable
behavior, rather than something that merely attacked the symptoms.</a> (Just as
<a name="4698qlink3">I would favor giving people a third eye through genetic engineering rather
than physically implanting mechanical eyes in every newborn's forehead, to
take an extreme example.)</a>

<a href="4687.html#4691qlink12">&gt; What I worry about is that the tendency to suggest that the "solution"</a><br>

<p>
Here we agree completely. But I would add a third possibility; some things
that some people see as "problems" others see as positive attributes. To
</a>
<a name="4698qlink5">return to the issue of the male sex drive (and there's nothing that says the
principle doesn't apply to the female sex drive as well), I would argue that
the reason that it is so overwhelming is because it is so vital to our
survival as a species. I believe that procreation is a good thing, and
should be encouraged (especially among Transhumanists). Technologies and/or
memes that deliberately cut down the birth-rate among the most productive
and inventive members of society (and I include Transhumanists in that
category) are ultimately detrimental to our species' welfare and should</a> be
avoided.
