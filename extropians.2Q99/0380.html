I've just finished a week of diving in Cozumel, my second extended dive trip 
since I got a basic SCUBA certification in May of 1998. Diving is 
technologically-oriented play and it exemplifies the use of intelligent 
technology to break through traditional human limits.  As I've become more 
and more adept at the basic knowledge and sensory-motor skills involved in 
diving, I've been struck by how much SCUBA diving exemplifies extropian 
values: To do it well, you have to overcome primitive fears, learn and use 
the biological science and physics of compressed nitrogen metabolism, air 
consumption and buoyancy control, understand and use the technology of 
regulators, buoyancy compensators and pressure and depth instrumentation, 
learn the important social conventions of a dive group's mutual safety 
responsibilities and master the new three-dimensional kinetic environment of 
the aquanaut.  On top of all that, you get to play with cool toys that are 
currently undergoing an influx of new high technology: Heads-up in-mask 
instrument displays, intelligent dive computers, and mixed-gas and rebreather 
technologies moving into the range of consumer use that extend depth and dive 
times. And the reward for all this?  As close as you'll come to zero-g short 
of free fall and access to a completely new and beautiful biosphere!!!!
