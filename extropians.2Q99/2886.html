As purely anecdotal evidence, I have been hit many times while in a variety
of different vehicles.  In one case I was hit by a Honda Accord while
driving a '79 Toyota Corolla (a dinky tin death trap).  Needless to say,
the impact was quite bone-jarring and it shoved the car pretty hard, but I
walked away the worse for wear.  I have also been slammed by a similar
Honda Accord while stationary in a Ford Bronco.  It totalled the Honda and
I was mildly annoyed when the Bronco shuddered under the impact, but
otherwise barely noticed I'd been hit.  I've been hit a number of times</a></a></a></a> by
a lot of other vehicles (and once or twice, I did the hitting), but</a> I chose
these two because the circumstances were very similar but in wildly
different vehicles.  I can say with great certainty that structural mass
makes a big difference where vehicle-vehicle collisions are concerned.  For
this reason alone, I drive heavy, steel-framed vehicles.  Considering the
relatively high odds of dying due to traffic fatalities, I view big, heavy
vehicles as an insurance policy.  (On the other hand, I am increasing the
odds that the other person involved in a collision with me will be mortally
injured.)
