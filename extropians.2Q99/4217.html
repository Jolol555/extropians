Those posting for the first few times could be anyone -- someone who has
never discussed extropian idea before *or* a well versed extropian who
hasn't been on this list before.  

<p>
Voting on whose posts are more popular than someone else's squelches
creativity.  Judging writings puts a lot of pressure on the posters and it
would seem to me that common sense might be a better quality to encourage
in posters than being a brilliant and well-liked. Not everyone agrees on
meaningful substance and the idea here is to encourage discussions on
varied extropian subjects. 

<p>
I agree that the those who trample on our sensibilities with self-motivated
berating tactics are annoying, as well as those whose posts flurry in all
day long. 

<p>
The best way to handle problems is to set an example (and this requires
those posting to think before hitting the send key); and to be *firm* about
what we will and will not accept on the extropian list by privately asking
someone to cease and desist from a particular behavior or to not bottleneck
our brains wastefully.  I like Max and Greg's direction now, and I think
that if we ask for quality, we will get it.
