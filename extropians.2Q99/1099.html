QUANTUM SCULPTING
<br>
Feedback enables researchers to control an
atom's wave function

<p>
by Graham P. Collins
<br>
The development of quantum mechanics, the underlying laws that govern matter 
and energy on the scale of atoms and electrons, has not only revolutionized 
our understanding of the universe but also has given us such technologies as 
the transistor, the laser and magnetic resonance imaging. Now Philip H. 
Bucksbaum and his co-workers at the University of Michigan have combined 
several recently developed techniques with a feedback system to control the 
very essence of quantum particles: their wave functions. The Bucksbaum 
experiment "is true quantum engineering," says physicist Michael G. Raymer 
of the University of Oregon. "It should open up many new possibilities, most 
of which we cannot even imagine now."

<p>
A wave function defines the physical state of a quantum object. Wave 
functions are slippery characters, tied to probabilities, not certainties. 
They obey the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle: if one characteristic 
is well defined, a related feature must be highly uncertain. For instance, 
an electron with a very precise position must have a wide range of possible 
velocities. Nevertheless, during the past decade a number of research groups 
have assembled techniques for manipulating and analyzing complete wave 
functions in detail.

<p>
Bucksbaum and his graduate students Thomas C. Weinacht and Jaewook Ahn apply 
their technique to a type of quantum state known as a Rydberg state, which 
occurs when an electron in an atom is excited to such a high energy level 
that it barely remains bound to the atom. "Rydberg states are a great 
laboratory to test new ideas," Bucksbaum explains. An electron with such 
high energy can occupy a very large number of quantum states. Combining 
those states in different proportions (that is, placing them in 
superposition) sculpts the shape of the electron's wave function. In one 
combination, for example, the electron is smeared out in a ring around the 
atom; in another, it is localized and orbits the atom much like a planet 
orbiting the sun.

<p>
The basic tool for such wave function sculpting is a strong, ultrashort 
laser pulse, which excites the electron from a lower energy level. Through a 
design developed by Warren S. Warren of acousto-optic modulator--a crystal 
whose optical properties are governed by precisely shaped sound waves. How 
the laser's intensity and phase vary over the 150-femtosecond pulse 
determines how the available excited states combine to produce the 
electron's sculpted wave function.

<p>
But what shape of laser pulse is needed to generate a specific sculpted 
electron wave function? In principle, this shape can be predicted by 
computations, but in practice one must contend with nonideal equipment and 
incomplete understanding of the physical system being controlled.

<p>
Bucksbaum's new trick, described in the January 21 issue of Nature, is to 
use feedback to modify the shaping pulse. His group works with a gas of 
cesium atoms in batches of about a million atoms. An approximate pulse 
excites the atoms, and the researchers map the shape of the resulting wave 
function with quantum holography, a technique they demonstrated a year ago. 
In optical holography, the three-dimensional shape of an object is 
reconstructed from its hologram, a special two-dimensional interference 
pattern. In quantum holography, measurements produce data loosely analogous 
to a hologram from which the complete wave function of the object can be 
reconstructed. In accordance with the uncertainty principle, however, each 
measurement disturbs the quantum "object," so the "hologram" must be built 
up one pixel at a time over many experimental runs, with thousands of 
identically prepared atoms measured on each run.

<p>
Once the physicists have mapped the resulting wave function, they look at 
the difference between that one and the desired one. This information is 
then used to adjust the detailed shape of the laser pulse used on subsequent 
batches of atoms. Bucksbaum found that after only two or three iterations 
this feedback zeroed in on the desired wave function.

<p>
Quantum control has applications in the burgeoning field of quantum 
computing, in which the encoding of data onto individual quantum states may 
allow the development of computers that function on quantum principles. 
Another application is control of chemical reactions. Shaped optical pulses 
that induce just the right excitations at specific bonds in a molecule can 
enhance or suppress alternate reaction pathways. Some groups have 
independently used feedback for this type of control, but the feedback has 
not been based on detailed mapping of a wave function.

<p>
Quantum physicist Carlos R. Stroud of the University of Rochester cautions 
that further research is needed to see if Bucksbaum's method is applicable 
to a wider range of quantum systems. Still, he says, "they have expanded the 
quantum mechanics toolbox."
