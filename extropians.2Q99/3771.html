If you revere Turing (as we all should), you'll really enjoy Stephenson's 
"Cryptonomicon" (which I can't praise highly enough, although I still haven't 
finished it).  It's no spoiler to reveal that Turing is a character in the 
book and reading Stephenson's humorous depiction of him as a living, 
breathing person has been a real joy.

I'm certainly not in the know, but Ray Kurzweil is.  In his book "The Age of 
Spiritual Machines" he does this very thing.  Examples of current 
achievements he gives include interpretation of naturally-spoken speech 
(naturally), recognizing faces and driving automobiles.  Near-term 
accomplishments should include real-time navigation of natural environments 
and mediating simple social interactions.
