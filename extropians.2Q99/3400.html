Yeah, that's true, and it sucks. You can't even hit the criminal too hard if
you're lucky enough to be bigger. There's a delightful consideration called
"reasonable force", which disallows the defender inflicting any damage on
the criminal.<a name="3428qlink1"> A guy was put away just recently for accidentally killing a
burglar that entered his home at night. The homeowner hit the burglar out
cold in a punch, and the burglar fell and hit his head.............</a> Anyway,
I take it all back. UK law sucks the most.
