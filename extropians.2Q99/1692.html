<a href="1686.html#1692qlink1">&gt; In large part, I think most of us agree on certain aspects</a><br>
<i>&gt; of what a 'sane' person would be, as particularly outlined</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Max More's Extropian Principles - Pancritical</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rationalism, Practical Optimism, the use of Korzybski's</i><br>
<i>&gt; E-Prime, as well as the assistance of advancing</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological augmentations...</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1703qlink1">I'll have to disagree on several points here.  First, I
think is possible to be completely sane and irrational.</a>
<a name="1703qlink2">A person who knowingly chooses a noncritical epistemology
and metphysics--a devout Christian, for example--is not
rational, but otherwise functions adequately according to
eir own sub-optimal choices, can interact usefully with
others, and is otherwise not "insane", in the sense that
ey is competent to make eir own choices, even if they are
<a name="1703qlink3">bad ones.</a>  I've always seen E-prime as a gimmick vaguely
related to clarity of thought and expression, but it is
so easy to come up with murky E-Prime and precise English
that I'm not convinced it's a good thing in general.
</a>
<a name="1703qlink4">Finally, I'm not yet entirely convinced that optimism is
optimal.  I do see some of Max's points as valuable, but
most of them are just rational.  I can't think of a single
decision I have made in my life on the basis of optimism
that wasn't just a rational choice for other reasons, and
even if there were a connection, I wouldn't call a 
pessimist "insane", even if ey was unpleasant to be around.
Indeed, I might seek eir advice before embarking upon some
risky venture to see if ey had better ideas about what
might go wrong.</a>
