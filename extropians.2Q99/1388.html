<a name="1394qlink1">Well, this has some implications.  It would seem unconstitutional.
Here is the issue, there is never a reason for anyone to listen to anyone else's
conversation unless they are directly involved in the conversation or it is a
public broadcast.

<p>
Law enforcement should be able to get access to telephone conversations and data
transfer if they have a warrant, but not otherwise.  To observe any telephone
conversation besides one's own and those that one has a privilege to observe
given by the people in a conversation, is a violation of rights.  Any time there
becomes government recording, there is to be notification.

<p>
When talking to service representatives of the phone company, you are notified
that the conversation is being recorded and then it is clear.  Any other
recording is a rights violation.</a>

<p>
<a name="1394qlink2">There is not reason for the equipment actually used to perform wiretaps to not
be available to law enforcement, but there should be checks and balances on its
use just like any other use</a> of it.

<p>
<a name="1394qlink3">These checks and balances should be available to be publicly monitored.  What
this would mean is that the prima facie elements of a case would have to be
established before any wiretapping.  Then, a warrant could be aquired,
conventionally, through a judge, then it would be constitutional to wiretap
someone.  To be actually constitutional, it might be necessary for there to be
notification.
