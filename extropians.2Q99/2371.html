Sounds like a rework of the Brady Bill and recent Illinois legislation. Why
would anyone object to this?

<p>
The Brady bills' original three day waiting (cooloff) period seems to be
just an annoyance to legitimate purchasers, and will probably result in
injury or death to people who otherwise may have been able to defend
themselves. Lawmakers are pressing to reinstate it even in the presence of
the electronic registry.

<p>
<a name="2385qlink2">I especially would like to see the liability waiver for trigger locks added
to present legislation - how the courts can apply negligence penalties to
someone who obviously took care to secure a dangerous item is beyond me.

<p>
<a name="2446qlink1">How do you feel about proposed limits on quantity purchases? I don't like
the idea of govt. telling me how many of an item I can buy - but again
can't see any legitimate reason for someone to need to buy more than one
gun at a time. A truly rabid collector who just came into lots of money,</a></a>
maybe?
