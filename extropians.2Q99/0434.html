I saw the movie and found it to be quite interesting. I liked the movie
quite a bit. It did bring up to the forefront of people's mind the
possibility that we, as a species, will be creating AI's within the next few
decades. We have to begin to prepare for all of the possibilities that might
come up. Personally, I would rather err on the side of caution with this
one, so movies showing the negative possibilities are as good, in my view,
as movies showing the positive possibilities.

<p>
A couple of things about the movie. If they were going to use biological
batteries, why use intelligent ones? Surely, it would be easier to fool
chimps or cows than humans. Plus, wouldn't all of the humans have been
clones? You would want to halt human evolution, wouldn't you? So why weren't
all of the freedom fighters simply clones? How about clones with Down's
Syndrome? Not to mention the fact that an artificial AI would be, oh, about
a million times faster than a neural AI. Very unlikely that a human would be
able to operate the Matrix faster than an artificial AI.

<p>
Just some thoughts.
