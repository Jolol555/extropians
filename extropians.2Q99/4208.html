<p>
I didn't think it was all that silly.  Not that my feelings are hurt.:)
Seriously, I believe setting up simple rules like mine would be easier than
moderating the list since traffic and membership is so high.  (I've been on
other lists where such rules have been informally implemented and they seem
to work quite well.  For example, Liberty Loop.  See my web page with the
link to "The Free Radical.")

<p>
The problem is, as mentioned by others, that quite a few people post their
arses off here, and even though we can filter or delete stuff, it would be
nice if the initial quality was high so as little filtering and deleting had
to go on at the end.  It's like the difference between reading the final
published novel by an author you like versus reading all her notes, diary
entries, rough drafts, and the like.

<p>
Another suggestion: we could implement these rules temporarily -- hey,
nothing is here that can't be changed and undone, right? -- for, say, a
week, then see if list quality goes up and members like it.  It might be the
case, after all, that my suggestions won't work -- or perhaps list quality
will go up only slightly while the effort and reduction in good posts goes
down overall.  I wouldn't want that.

<p>
Cheers!
