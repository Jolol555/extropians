I think you are doing exactly what you should be doing -- keeping abreast
with current trends in technology. It's next to impossible to predict what
the next big thing will be. Even if you are right in a prediction, you won't
know if you were right or wrong until it is the current big thing. By
fooling around with linux, C++, java, and whatever else comes by, you are
making sure you understand and can use the latest tools if need be. If java
suddenly explodes next year into the most in-demand skill, you will have
already fiddled with it and will be able to adapt quickly. 

<p>
Harness your adaptation skills. They will be the most important skills in
the next 10 years of rapid change. Never become a stale VB programmer.
Specialization is the key to extinction during times of rapid change.
Keep learning. Know how to do everything competently. Don't worry about
becoming a grand master of one thing. That only pays off in the short term.

<a name="3237qlink1">For specifics, I would pay attention to Java, Networking, Platform
Neutrality, and maybe even AI (although no telling when AI will come of
age), and make sure you are good at writing multi-threaded software because
undoubtedly the future is in parallel.</a>
