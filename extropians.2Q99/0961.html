Thanks Doug.  Do you know what dosages are recommended?  Even if I do go
with the real thing, I would probably cycle between the HGH and amino acids.
Dr. Klatz seems to characterize Arginine as the more potent of the two
though.  Do you have any references for your statement that Glutamine is the
only effective oral GH releaser?  Theres another mail list I'd like to share
this info with.  What am I saying?  Of course you have references.  ;^)
