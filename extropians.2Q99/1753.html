<p>
This is your primary error that you continue to espouse. I make no claims for any god. You agree with my statements that Natural Law is well established as a codification of thousands of years of accurate observations of what is beneficial for humanity, yet you refuse to acknowledge that these observations are experimental and experiential confirmation that Natural Law as a concept is an inherent substrate of the reality of this universe, or you are denying that this universe is real. Either assumption on your part is irrational and illogical. If you continue to insist on these assumptions, please prove your point as I have done.
