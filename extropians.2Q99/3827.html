I have to agree with Nadia on this. While even I was rather taken aback by over
30 rude and insulting messages over a few days from one list member, the idea
that discussion of a subject of any kind of liberty should be banned from the
list of a group that supposedly embraces personal liberty is rather ludicrous.
One of the main reasons I joined ExI was because I found it to be one</a> of the
last refuges against the  whiney statist liberal security-before-liberty soccer
mom neo-luddite NIMBYites. The recent watering down of the Extropian Principles
to embrace more statist attitudes was the warning shot, an outright moratorium
on discussion of a subject regarding liberty is blasphemy. Principles are meant
to be stood on, not moved in response to polls or popular sentiment.

<p>
Just as law abiding citizens are seeing their rights curtailed and made more
difficult to practice because of the misbehavior of a few disrespectful
individuals, so it is here.
