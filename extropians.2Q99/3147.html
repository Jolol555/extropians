<i>&gt; &gt; "95% of goods in the shop were above the average price of goods in the</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; make sense?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yep. 5% of the goods are really cheap (the stuff that I buy).</i><br>

<p>
Agreed.  The store can sell 95 items that cost one dollar and 5 items that
cost half a dollar.  The average price is 0.975 dollars.  "95% of goods in
the shop were above the average price of goods in the shop."  No problem
there.

<a name="3185qlink1"><a name="3156qlink1"><a name="3151qlink1">Now try this one:  A large corporation who gives me my security consulting
assignments just changed the definition of "meeting objectives" for the
year.  Our new objectives are that "we will exceed objectives."  I'm not
sure if by exceeding objectives, I am now merely meeting them.  Nor am I
sure how to exceed them anymore.  The explanation of the new policy also
stated that unlike last year, because of the higher standards, most
employees will be rated below average, while only a few will make it up to
average ratings.
