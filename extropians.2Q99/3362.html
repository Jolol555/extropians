So why is it that a large fraction (possibly the vast majority) of bullets
are fired at little pieces of paper? I've shot an awful lot of them myself
in the past, and precisely 0.00000000000% of them have been fired at another
person. If the only reason to own a gun is to shoot people who try to shoot
you, why are most guns used for target shooting or (in America) hunting?
