My recollection of the shooting of the Japanese student is that he was on
his way to a party with someone else, and was wearing a Halloween-type
mask.  This frightened the homeowner, who yelled 'freeze', and then shot
the student when, not understanding the word 'freeze', the student
continued to approach.  The student and his companion had approached the
home because they had car trouble and wanted to call for help.
