Not this Extropian. I take great exception to this obviously racist attack on
a real urban futurist art form. Hip hop was the first comercially sucessful
electronic music. The philosophy of hip hop is clearly individualist in
nature.  Plus i don't think that you have the brain power to wipe hip hop off
the face of the earth. Unless you are some artistic genius and could invent a
new musical form to take it's place. Even then the hip hop community would
respond creatively as they have always done in the face of racist and bigoted

attacks.

<a href="0129.html#0192qlink2">&gt; You and I have such different vocabularies that it would take a very long</a><br>
<i>&gt; time to establish communication. I don't get my philosophical vocabulary</i><br>
<i>&gt; from Hofstadter and Vinge. I thought you would understand my reference to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ur-meme immediately. Do you understand how Judaism works as a meme?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Have you read Everett Fox's translation of the Torah?  or Aryeh Kaplan's</i><br>
<i>&gt; translation of Sefer Yetzirah?  or Isaiah, in any translation?  or "The Art</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Biblical Poetry" by Robert Alter? I guess you don't think that sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing is worth bothering with. Not to mention Frege, Wittgenstein, Austin,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Goedel (his own papers, not filtered through GEB), Rene Thom, and all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other stuff I read. I read a lot of math -- not Hofstadter's</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-reflective stuff, but plain old math. And plain old science -- I</i><br>
<i>&gt; subscribe to Nature and read it every week; it would never occur to me to</i><br>
<i>&gt; subscribe to a science fiction magazine, or to make science fiction the</i><br>
<i>&gt; center of my thought. And plain old history, and plain old fiction and</i><br>
<i>&gt; poetry (Homer, Virgil, Shakespeare, Keats, Goethe, Rilke, etc). We have</i><br>
<i>&gt; both read Dawkins, but the "meme" meme by itself is not enough to establish</i><br>
<i>&gt; a common ground for discussion of ultimate goals and how to get there.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nevertheless there is a deep resonance here. As I read your web site, I get</i><br>
<i>&gt; an eerie sense of deja vu. I feel like I am reading my own notebooks from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; decade ago. At that time I still believed in AI. I wanted to create a new</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind of entity, not exactly a religion, not exactly a business, not exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; a school, but a combination of all three -- a network of schools and</i><br>
<i>&gt; businesses that would make money not for its own sake but with the aim of</i><br>
<i>&gt; creating the Singularity. (I actually used that word for a while, after</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to a Terence McKenna seminar at Esalen in 1988). The whole thing was</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to be organized as a corporation called Recursive Systems. For</i><br>
<i>&gt; various reasons nothing ever came of this. I guess the main obstacle was</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I was uncomfortable with the messianic pretensions involved.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are three ways to get people to write checks:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.  Define your project as research in computer science, with potential</i><br>
<i>&gt; military applications. Explain it in terms that make sense to agencies such</i><br>
<i>&gt; as NSF and DOD (or their equivalents in some other country).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.  Define your project as a business. Break it down into steps, in such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; way that each step is profitable in its own right. Do the same thing with</i><br>
<i>&gt; your AI system that Stephen Wolfram did with Mathematica, or John Walker</i><br>
<i>&gt; did with AutoCad, or Bill Gates did with MS-DOS. It is still possible to</i><br>
<i>&gt; start from scratch and make billions of dollars in the software industry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Someone will have the same dominant position in robotic software that Bill</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gates has in PC software. (This is what I meant the other day when I said</i><br>
<i>&gt; you wouldn't have to worry about money if you spent your time writing</i><br>
<i>&gt; software instead of reading the list.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3.  Define your project in religious terms, in such a way that people care</i><br>
<i>&gt; about it and want to see it happen. Call it Singularitarianism, or some</i><br>
<i>&gt; such ism. Or just say you are going to create the Messiah, or be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Messiah. A lot of people will believe this and write checks, if you have</i><br>
<i>&gt; the stomach for it. It is still possible to make money with cults. I see</i><br>
<i>&gt; living proof of this every day -- I live across the street (diagonally)</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the Scientology Celebrity Center. The money pours in. There are also a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot of preachers making a ton of money off the coming Apocalypse. But I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't think anybody has pursued this from a specifically Jewish angle. A</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot of Jews here in Los Angeles (and elsewhere) expect the Messiah to</i><br>
<i>&gt; appear any day. The opportunity is there, for whoever wants it. I don't. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; the first one didn't come back to life after they crucified him, I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; imagine my prospects would be any better.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think path #2 is the wisest choice.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not going to be writing checks for the Elisson Project, because, as I</i><br>
<i>&gt; explained in geniebusters, I think the whole thing is based on a fallacy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; To say that computing power is doubling every n years is at most a</i><br>
<i>&gt; half-truth. The number of transistors on a chip is doubling, and the clock</i><br>
<i>&gt; speed is doubling, but that doesn't imply that intelligence is doubling. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't imply that there is going to be a Singularity. It wouldn't surprise</i><br>
<i>&gt; me if, a decade from now, you write something like geniebusters, in which</i><br>
<i>&gt; you describe how it gradually (or perhaps suddenly) dawned on you that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; plus the software you create will always understand philosophy better than</i><br>
<i>&gt; the software by itself. It should be an interesting paper -- maybe better</i><br>
<i>&gt; than geniebusters, which is certainly not the last word on the subject.</i><br>
