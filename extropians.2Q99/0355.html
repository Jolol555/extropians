Yes, but keep in mind the Matrix was designed by the AI's so there wouldn't be
any escape.  The plug-ins Morpheus is using seem to be stolen parts from the
liquid "human-container" vats.  They were designed to *always* stay plugged
in.  Although, Morpheus and his team have had some success over the years
hacking the Matrix software and hardware, so far he has only come up with a
difficult hack around very complex and rigid protocols, that in cyberspace
appear as telephone booths.  This would make sense, since a virtual telephone
booth would have to allow communication between most of the humans throughout
the entire set of real-world physical human habitat megastructures.
Therefore, tapping into the telephone system also taps into the underlying
communication infrastructure of the Matrix.  Personally, I think these
Wachowski brothers are frigging geniuses!
