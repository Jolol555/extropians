From: "Billy Brown" &lt;bbrown@conemsco.com&gt;

<p>
<a href="1430.html#1436qlink1">&gt;So which is the problem - the fact that McDonald's will buy cheap</a><br>
<i>&gt;beef, or the fact that the Brazilians are willing to clear-cut</i><br>
<i>&gt;their rain forest to raise cattle?  I'd say the latter.</i><br>

<p>
The fact that poor people will do whatever they have to is the
problem.


<p>
<a href="1430.html#1436qlink2">&gt;&gt; Mature maybe, old growth... no way. They log on so-called nature</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; preserves all the time..</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1430.html#1436qlink3">&gt;I know - one more example of how well socialist solutions work. </a><br>
<i>&gt;:-)</i><br>

<p>
We agree on this.

<p>
<a href="1430.html#1436qlink4">&gt;But it only matters for a tiny fraction of the ecology.  We've got</a><br>
<i>&gt;lots of 30-60 year old timber, which is plenty old enough to form</i><br>
<i>&gt;a habitat for virtually the entire ecosystem.  It would be nice if</i><br>
<i>&gt;we could also save that last 1% that needs an authentic old-growth</i><br>
<i>&gt;forest, but that isn't in the same league as the major problems in</i><br>
<i>&gt;other parts of the world.</i><br>

<p>
A monocultural block of trees is not a forest, and to be fair under
your definition, South America should be free to destroy all but 1%
of the rainforest.


<p>
<a href="1430.html#1436qlink5">&gt;Well, what exactly do you mean by "environmentally sound". </a><br>
<i>&gt;Pollution levels are falling, conservation efforts are growing,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and every reasonable effort is being made to avoid causing damage</i><br>
<i>&gt;(along with a lot of unreasonable efforts).  I don't see that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;would make sense to do more.  It makes more sense to devote our</i><br>
<i>&gt;limited financial resources to developing advanced technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;(which could free us from many of the tradeoffs we currently</i><br>
<i>&gt;face) than to spend even more money trying to preserve a tiny</i><br>
<i>&gt;fraction of the ecosphere that happens to be very vulnerable to</i><br>
<i>&gt;perturbations.</i><br>

<p>
I agree things are better than they were, but we are a long way
from being in balance with our ecosystem. We agree that the answer
is more/better technology rather than less. The Bioneers are a good
example.

<p>
I'm saying that having had our way with our ecosystem and arguing
over doing in the last 1%, we're in no position to tell other
people what they should be doing.

<p>
Lead by example.
