The security issue in this situation lies in repitition, a layering of
programming instructions, one atop the other thus covering any holes. There
would also have to be an on board repair command. This would recreate a
failed structure before activation began. Consider also, replaceable parts.
Your focus is a well stated fact, programming and software will be important
implimentations of a utility fog or nanoassembler.

<i>&gt;&gt; The big advantage of ufog is that it provides many of the advantages of</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; general-purpose assemblers are ubiquitous.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is often easier to rely on finished products than having the</i><br>
<i>&gt;production system itself (only DIY people, survivalists and</i><br>
<i>&gt;programmers disagree :-).</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; However, it also looks like ufog is pretty hazardous by itself.  Think of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the lung disease that could be caused by misprogrammed ufog.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The problem seems to be that it is impossible to test very complex</i><br>
<i>&gt;systems for all possible contingencies, and this will likely cause</i><br>
<i>&gt;trouble when designing ufog. How do you convince the customers it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;perfectly safe?</i><br>
<i>&gt;You get the same problem with AI: what testing would be required</i><br>
<i>&gt;before an AI program was allowed to completely run a nuclear power</i><br>
<i>&gt;plant? Most likely a lot, and even then I guess insurance premiums</i><br>
<i>&gt;would go up and if somethind did go wrong people would be sued to</i><br>
<i>&gt;hell. But having humans is allright, as long as they have had a</i><br>
<i>&gt;certain education and passed certain less stringent tests.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Also, the value would then shift from the material to the intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; property, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Intellectual property however, can be cheap.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Values are already shifting from material to intellectual values.</i><br>
