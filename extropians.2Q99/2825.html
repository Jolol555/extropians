<a href="2794.html#2825qlink1">&gt; &gt; The entire gun debate revolves around present-day examples,</a><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt; &gt; and I don't think present-day humans are an ideal, so they shouldn't be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; allowed near guns.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="2905qlink1"><i>&gt; What a paradox. If people were ideal, we wouldn't need guns.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Yeah, if all people were responsible, competent and nonviolent, we 
wouldn't need them, and there would be no problem with everyone 
having them.  But it's not a perfect world, so we need to try to keep 
guns out of the hands of the insane, violent criminals and kids, 
while taking care not to interfere with the freedoms</a> of the 
responsible.
<br>

<a href="2794.html#2825qlink2">&gt; &gt; Well, no shit, sherlock.</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I would FAR RATHER discuss technologies which would develop people's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; self-control and reason such that they are CAPABLE of handling such</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technologies.  Humans nowadays are barely evolved past monkey stage, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'm usually not at all convinced that we have gone beyond monkeys.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Especially en masse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well that is a very politically incorrect topic.  Before we can do very much about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; situation we have to realize that:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     1. Some people are much better/smarter than other people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     2. Most of that difference is genetic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     3. Despite the fact that the education industry is one of the biggest industries in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; country, education technology is still in the stone age (it is not very useful).</i><br>
