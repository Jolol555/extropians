<p>
I entered the precocious kid mode, and tried the above, gave the question
"Why don't satellites fall to the Earth?" to Altavista.

<p>
Altavista returned a list of pages about satellites, but nothing to answer
the question.

<p>
Then I tried, to read the Altavista Help, and tried the question
"+satellite +intro"

<p>
Altavista then returned the page

<p>
as the second entry.  By clicking on "Anatomy of a Satellity", I found a
page with a "clickable satellite".  Clicking on "Orbit" gave the URL

Surprising as it may seem, after a satellite is launched into space, it
needs little to no power to keep it moving. Satellites move in a path
around the Earth called an orbit. Every satellite must have an orbital
path (remember, satellites that travel into deep space to look at distant
planets are not true satellites, they are in fact space probes), and the
type of path it takes is determined by the physics involved.

<p>
A satellite's orbit works because of a balance between two forces. The
<a name="3403qlink1">orbit is a combination of the satellite's velocity - the speed it is travelling
in a straight line - and the force of the Earth's gravitational pull on the
satellite. These forces are similar to the forces that keep all the planets in
</a>
their places in the solar system. That gravitational pull is the result of the
mass or weight of the Earth and the mass of the satellite. Basically,
gravity keeps the satellite's velocity from sending the satellite flying out
in a straight line away from the Earth, and the satellite's velocity keeps
the force of gravity from pulling the satellite back to Earth.
