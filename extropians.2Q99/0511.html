Hi, I'm new to this particular mail group...  I'm an Financial IT
Administrator, operating as Technophile Consulting Inc.  I Direct a
sideline society organized, called Canadian Scientific Paranormal
Investigations, who is a group that volunteers to scientifically
investigate any claims of anomalous phenomena, and explain it rationally,
with evidence.

I would definitely go to Mars.  At the pace the space organisations are
going at, there will probably be a commercial shuttle/cruiser link to Mars,
before a government sanctioned one.

<p>
We have sub-orbital commercial shuttle flights and a Japanese development
contract for a resort on the moon.  It's not long before a cruiser-size
vessel is used to ferry people there and back- there's a demand for
passengers with the financial means to travel into near space, a business
opportunity that's on the ground-floor now.  In 10 years, the space race
will be making more instant millionaires than the internet, today. (To
quote another email which came in through extropians.)

<p>
We have the technology and the money, Mars is well within reach as long as
we have the courage.
