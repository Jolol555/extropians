I have just updated the conference web pages on ExI's site. A list of
confirmed
<br>
speakers is now up, and an updated Program. The program is still in flux,
as we
<br>
add more speakers to the line-up, and as we make adjustments based on topic
focus and speaker availability.

<p>
Among the experts from outside the familiar Extropian circle are:

<p>
Prof. Judith Campisi, Head of the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and
Group Leader, Aging and Cancer Research, Berkeley National Laboratory.

<p>
Calvin Harley, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, Geron Corporation, Menlo Park,
California.

<p>
Prof. Cynthia Kenyon, Dept. of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of
California, San Francisco.

<p>
Prof. Michael H. Shapiro, Dorothy W. Nelson Professor of Law, University of
Southern California Law School.

<p>
For the complete list and program update, please check out the new conference
web pages. And expect more frequent updates from now on.

<p>
The Biotech Futures (Extro 4) conference seems to be coming at a time when
interest in the topics we're focusing on has never been higher. Besides being
the biggest extropian/transhumanist networking event of the last two years, I
think the conference offers a perfect opportunity to catapult more of our
thinking into the mainstream.

<p>
Finally, please note that some of the Saturday evening sessions are still
open.
<br>
If you have a proposal for a talk/panel/debate, please let me know. The
evening
<br>
break-out sessions can be a bit less formal and more forward-looking than the
daytime sessions.

<p>
Onward!

<p>
