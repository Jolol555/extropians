<i>&gt; First you say you were too busy to enforce the ban.  Then you say you will</i><br>
<i>&gt; "try to come up with a fair and reasonable approach".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is there going to be a ban or not?  It is plain unprofessional to make a big</i><br>
<i>&gt; announcement, fail to follow through, and then try to avoid the effects of</i><br>
<i>&gt; your actions later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To be honest, I think so many people have broken the ban that ExI cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforce it.  If they were to unsubscribe all the people like they said, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; list would dwindle.  If they don't do what they said, they look like</i><br>
<i>&gt; hypocrites.  I predict that they will make vague excuses and try to reword</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ban later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What irks me is that this is not an unexpected outcome of the ban.  ExI has</i><br>
<i>&gt; a history of making big announcements and then being surprised at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; results of their own actions.  They announced a fee for the list early on</i><br>
<i>&gt; and were surprised that people dropped out.  They originally did not allow</i><br>
<i>&gt; people to quote the list to outsiders and were surprised that people did.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They tried to make the list members-only, and did not expect the outcry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now they announce a topic ban, and seem unprepared to actually enforce their</i><br>
<i>&gt; own ban.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is repeated incompetence.  Why do we keep having problems that were</i><br>
<i>&gt; totally predictable and avoidable?  Basically it is because the ExI board</i><br>
<i>&gt; are too busy with their own projects to really run this list, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; newsletter, the magazine, the node-nets, or any of the grand plans that have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been announced.  I would suggest that such announcement be delayed in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; future until a working plan has been thought out.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Thanks for your post.  I'm very busy at work this week, so can only do</i><br>
<i>&gt; quick</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; strafing runs at the problem till the weekend.  Have emailed privately all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; posters.  Most claim to have missed my announcement of to have made an</i><br>
<i>&gt; honest</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mistake in interpreting it.  Will try to come up with a fair and</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; approach to repeat posters this weekend.  Appreciate your input.</i><br>
