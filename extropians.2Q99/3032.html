Educate kids, educate parents.

A not-so-funny conversation I overheard in a Los Angeles gun store about
two weeks ago:
<hr>
<br>
CUSTOMER:  I want to buy a high capacity .380 pistol for home defense.

<p>
STORE CLERK:  They don't make high capacity .380s.  How about a high
capacity 9mm? It is pretty similar.

<p>
CUSTOMER:  No, I want a .380 because I have a 4-year old daughter.

<p>
STORE CLERK:  What does that have to do with buying a .380 versus a 9mm?

<p>
CUSTOMER:  I heard the .380 is less lethal, so if my daughter accidentally
shoots herself, she might only be injured instead of killed.

<p>
STORE CLERK (dumbfounded):  A gun should never be in a place where your
daughter will play with it.  I am sorry, but if you can't keep your guns
out of the hands of your kids, then I cannot in good conscience sell you a
gun.  
<hr>


<p>
The extreme abdication of this father's responsibility for the welfare of
his daughter is simply stunning.  It is half-cocked idiots like the
customer above that give guns a bad name.  And it wasn't that this guy was
malevolent; he was just clueless to a degree I never thought possible.  I
<a name="3947qlink6"><a name="3743qlink1">have no problem with having Proof of Competence being a prerequisite to
buying a gun,</a> because it is fairly obvious from the above example that some
people need</a> it.
