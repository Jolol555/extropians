<p>
A potential threat, yes.  A menace, probably not.  I was in a
restaurant with friends, waiting to be seated, when four tough young
men pushed their way ahead of us.  Keith mildly said, "It's
customary to give your name to the hostess and wait to be seated,"
whereupon the bravos clenched fists &amp; teeth as their leader snarled,
"What are you gonna do about it?!"  Keith's son and I backed him up,
then his wife placed her hands on her belt by her (open carry) 9mm
pistol and sweetly said, "We're just asking you to show good
manners."

<p>
The bluff and bluster went away, as did the four belligerent young
men.

<p>
The presence of the gun made resorting to violence unnecessary.  It
could have gotten very ugly had Pattie not been armed.  Armed
citizens deter far more crime than they commit.</a>
