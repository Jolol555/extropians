Two excellent questions, Emlyn.  I have been pondering these:
Do men talk differently to men than to women?  Assuming none are
hoping for a sexual encounter, such as a conversation taking place
at work, why would you choose different words and phrases when
talking to different genders?  How does it work when talking to one
</a>
of homo-orientation?  Why should it matter in a nonsexual context?
<a name="3818qlink2">Or is there such a thing as a completely nonsexual context?</a>

<p>
I know that conversations between two women is much different
that conversations between two men.  I have always assumed it
is because we evolved as hunter/gatherers.  The women eased
the boredom of gathering by talking and sharing, the men had to
shut up to keep from alerting the game.  So.  A million years later,
the ladies communicate and the men silently watch sports.  {8^D spike
