<a name="4021qlink1">I can't stand hypocrisy.  Do it, or don't do it, but stop waffling.

<p>
First you say you were too busy to enforce the ban.  Then you say you will
"try to come up with a fair and reasonable approach".

<p>
Is there going to be a ban or not?  It is plain unprofessional to make a big
announcement, fail to follow through, and then try to avoid the effects of
your actions later.

<p>
To be honest, I think so many people have broken the ban that ExI cannot
enforce it.  If they were to unsubscribe all the people like they said, the
list would dwindle.  If they don't do what they said, they look like
hypocrites.  I predict that they will make vague excuses and try to reword
the ban later.

<p>
What irks me is that this is not an unexpected outcome of the ban.  ExI has
a history of making big announcements and then being surprised at the
results of their own actions.  They announced a fee for the list early on
and were surprised that people dropped out.  They originally did not</a> allow
people to quote the list to outsiders and were surprised that people did.
They tried to make the list members-only, and did not expect the outcry.
Now they announce a topic ban, and seem unprepared to actually enforce their
own ban.

<p>
This is repeated incompetence.  Why do we keep having problems that were
totally predictable and avoidable?  Basically it is because the ExI board
are too busy with their own projects to really run this list, the
newsletter, the magazine, the node-nets, or any of the grand plans that have
been announced.  I would suggest that such announcement be delayed in the
future until a working plan has been thought out.
