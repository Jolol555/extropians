There are examples of that.  Loss of technology has been known to happen
when a branch of a civilization gets cut off from the main branch.  Small
groups cannot maintain the level of sophistication that larger groups
can.  And when there are not enough members of the group, so that all
technology can be passed from one generation to the next, technology is
lost.
