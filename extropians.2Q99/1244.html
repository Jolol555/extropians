Dr. Patrick Flanagan at the age of 11 designed a missile and atomic bomb 
detector - that our government classifies as "Top Secret" - and then 
incorporates it as a significant part of its defense program. By the age of 
14, he designs the Neurophone®, an electronic device that transmits sound 
from the skin directly to the brain through the nervous system, not the 
bones or ears. By the age of 18, he was named as one of the Top Ten most 
promising young scientists in America by Life Magazine.(I believe he was on 
the cover) He was part of the Gemini Space Program at NASA when he was 19, 
and at 23, he worked for the U.S. Navy as a computer designer translating 
human speech into dolphin language for the Man-Dolphin Communications 
Program. Flanagan was famous for his book Pyramid Power, about his consuming 
interest in energy and bioenergy systems of the human body. His most recent 
recognition came as he was honored as "1997 Scientist of the Year" by the 
scientific community.

<a href="1230.html#1244qlink1">&gt;I had run across Dr Flanagan. I had heard a great deal about his</a><br>
<i>&gt;neurophon. I was curious if any of you all had more information about him.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Some of this inventions seem pretty amazing, and others seem a bit</i><br>
<i>&gt;sketchy. I also had heard discussion once of a "russian sleeping machine."</i><br>
<i>&gt;I searched the web and found no information on it. Thanks for the help on</i><br>
<i>&gt;any resources that might help me better investigate.</i><br>
