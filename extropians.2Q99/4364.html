Nah.  I've heard you call the Internet ELTM.  That qualifies you for the
'Net Generation.

Last time I checked, the estimate for real uploading was one person, a
Manhattan Project, and 2040 CRNS.  This sounds about right to me.  I
mean, really, once you can upload the very first human, you've got a
Singularity on a silver platter; you just speed up the uploadee. 
Uploading is ultratechnology even by an ultratechnologist's standards. 
Uploading is an order of magnitude more difficult than writing a mind
from scratch (or cribbing from DNA, of course). I'll be running Elisson
on my pocket calculator, Quasars will be running the planet, and Zyvex
will have the planet all runny, a decade before uploading is feasible.

<p>
Likewise, how far away is a "safe distance" from a Singularity?  Answer:
 The next galaxy isn't far enough.  The Great Filter Paradox, right? 
Evidently even alien races that are peaceful enough to cooperate on
doing these things from a "safe distance", and paranoid enough to want
to do so, still aren't spreading throughout the Universe and landing in
our backyard.  I find this rather heartening, actually - if the PSEs are
going around deliberately expending effort to vacuum up their creators,
it's far more likely to be altruism than malevolence.  But it does mean
that watching the Singularity from a safe distance is a pipe dream.  You
don't think that's been tried?

<p>
Incidentally, how about if *humanity* stays on the planet and you run
the *AI* in the asteroid belt?  That's still impractical but at least
it's not absurd.
