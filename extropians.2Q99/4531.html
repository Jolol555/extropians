<p>
If it does not sit with you, then you are a functionalist. You argue that if
it has all of the functions of a human mind, then it will also be conscious.

<p>
There are a whole range of "man-is-special" philosophers who just hate this
idea. their argument essentially boils down to the zombie (they have an
infinite range of variants on this theme such as "the swamp brain" and "Mary
blind physicist", but they are all similar to the zombie argument.)

<p>
This says that you could build which was in-principle indistinguishable from
a conscious human, yet was a zombie.

<p>
Dennett's retort to this oh-so-handy escapism is to note that a zombie would
not only have our behaviours, but also our sensations, and perceptions, and
our emotions - "its" sole difference from us is that it wouldn't be
conscious of these feelings. As far as Dennett (and me too) are concerned,
this kind of seeing, thinking, feeling, unconscious zombie is just fine and
in fact lacks nothing: that is once you define consciousness as something
which can be absent in the presence of a thought, you have defined it as a
nonentity. I am convinced that thinking is intrinsically conscious activity
and therefore do not believe in zombies.
