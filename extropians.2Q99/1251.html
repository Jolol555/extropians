<a href="1239.html#1251qlink1">&gt; If you need physics problems, get any edition second or later (they found</a><br>
<i>&gt; most of the errors after the first ed) , of Haliday and Resnick's college</i><br>
<i>&gt; Physics Text book.  A great  basis for physics, uses calclus where</i><br>
<i>&gt; appropriate, has lots of good problems, some worked out, some with answers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Use Feynmann for the concepts, the way to think about physics. His lectures</i><br>
<i>&gt; while very clear at times, are very deep.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   H &amp;R, get the mechanics, the problems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Yup, it's classic, and it has really good problems. Be aware, however, that
while the book with both volumes in  one cover is (I think) Halliday and
Resnick, the book was originally published in two volumes, the first
of which is by Resnick and Halliday. They explain this in the preface,
but it may lead to confusion while looking for the books. The title is
"Physics."
