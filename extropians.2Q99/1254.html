Well, that seems a little more believable that this miracle-cure stuff.  Of
course, if it really worked we would expect it to have attracted a lot more
attention (and scientific analysis) by now.  Presumably either there are
serious side effects that make its use unsafe, or it doesn't actually work.

That part I believed.  The patent office tries to screen out inventions that
don't actually work, but they've never been all that successful at it.  A
lot of weird pseudoscience manages to get patented, either because the
examiner believes in it or because it looks good enough on paper to fool
him.

<p>
OOPS!  Mea cupla!  Many, many apologies.  Yes, the DIA does exist (that's
what I get for writing replies in such a hurry).  They don't do much in any
of the areas I follow, so its easy to overlook them.
