The problem then is that some people do not have the right pieces of paper
<br>
(money) to buy food. If these people do not get food through charitable means<br>
they become losers under the current rules of the game of life (death through
starvation). Changing the rules (politics) has never stopped this problem, but
just made different winners and losers. That is why Buckminster Fuller
<a href="http://209.196.135.250/">http://209.196.135.250/</a> sought a solution through a game where political
solutions to world tangible need shortages were disallowed. There are solutions
through proficient use of current resources to allot of human problems (new
technologies are need to solve the rest).

<p>
I say:
<br>
The solution for 'proficient use of current resources' is the free market. Any
country where you can find widespread malnutrition you will find excessive state
control of the economy, and manipulation of the same to repress some dissident
portion of the population.
