Astonishing though it may seem ,... no, no, I don't believe it.  Cynthia
must have been sardonically jerking the old chain when she wrote:

<p>
<a href="3087.html#3223qlink1">&gt;First of all, the Swiss have effectively stopped defective people from</a><br>
breeding
<br>
<a href="3087.html#3223qlink2">&gt;over a period of hundreds of years, so that the incidence of defective</a><br>
people is lower than ours
<br>
<a href="3087.html#3223qlink3">&gt;(but not as low as it is for the Jews and Japanese). </a><br>

<p>
<a href="3087.html#3223qlink4">&gt;But here we have the myth that there is no such thing as a defective</a><br>
person, just under funded
<br>
<a href="3087.html#3223qlink5">&gt;schools. And instead of putting violent people into prison, we have social</a><br>
reformers who want
<br>
<a href="3087.html#3223qlink6">&gt;to make the whole country a prison. </a><br>

<p>
So let me just add:

<p>
Ven ve haf identifite ze defectifs, zen ve shall purify our zoziety,...ve
shall cleanse our national temple by sending zem all to ze showers.

<p>
Look in the mirror, and repeat the following:

<p>
I am not defective, really, I'm sure of it.  

<pre>
"We'll meet again,
Don't know where
Don't know when
</pre>
<br>
But we all will meet again some sunny day!





<p>
			Best, Jeff Davis
