Researchers succeed in knotting DNA molecule
Kyodo News Service/Associated Press

<p>
TOKYO, June 3 (Kyodo) -- A group of Japanese researchers have succeeded in
knotting a single DNA molecule for the first time ever, according to
Thursday's issue of a British scientific weekly.

<p>
The report, published in Nature magazine, describes how the scientists
attached a bead to either end of a molecule of DNA in lambda phage, a
cell-destroying virus found in coli bacillus, and used optical tweezers to
maneuver the beads to tie a knot.

<p>
The task of tying the knot is said to take only "tens of seconds."

<p>
They used the same microscopic procedure to tie a knot with a filament of
rabbit skeletal actin, a cellular protein that contributes to muscular
contraction and cellular movement.

<p>
Comparing the two knots, the researchers found that the DNA molecule's knot
was more flexible because the actin broke at the knot when bent using a
force of one-10 billionth of a gram, while the DNA knot did not break when
bent with a force 20 times as great.

<p>
"The DNA is tough so we expect it can be used as a thread in microscopic<br>
surgery involving tying together cells and nerves," said a member of the
research project headed by Yasuharu Arai, a former graduate student at Keio
University.

<p>
The DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a two-chained nucleic acid which plays a
central role in the storage and replication of hereditary information and in
the expression of this information through combinations with protein.

<p>
The research was a joint effort by Keio's Department of Physics, the genetic
programming team at Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology,
and the Tsukuba Research Laboratory.
