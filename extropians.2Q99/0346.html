How is it that some people can, and some can't? I don't see any reason why
I'd be any less addicted than anyone else. Perhaps, I hadn't been smoking
long enough? I was smoking for nearly three years before tapering off and
eventually stopping completely. (winding down over about 1 month)</a>

<a name="0351qlink2">The trick I used was visualization. I simply saw them as something
disgusting, a habit which was more like eating shit, than jello. So</a> I
stopped.
