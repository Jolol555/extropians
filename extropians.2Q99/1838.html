Objet : RE: Property Rights


<p>
<a href="1833.html#1838qlink1">&gt;I have two simple questions for those who have expressed anti-property</a><br>
<i>&gt;opinions on this thread.</i><br>

<p>
probably I was in the clouds but I don't recall somebody was *against*
property rights here... if you have a reference for such claim in the
mailing list I would be quite interested to see it.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1833.html#1838qlink2">&gt;To those who have suggested that we should abandon private property, I ask</a><br>
<i>&gt;what you propose to replace it with.  We can't determine which alternative</i><br>
<i>&gt;is superior unless we actually have two concrete ideas to compare.</i><br>

<p>
I seems to recall Mr Musick told that he believed that if all peoples had
complete respect for each other there would be no need of property rights...
but i'm not sure at all of my correct formulation of his thinking... of
course I believe this one above to be completly impractical.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1833.html#1838qlink3">&gt;To those who have suggested that we should abandon any sort of property</a><br>
<i>&gt;system, I have a more fundamental question.  A system of property exists to</i><br>
<i>&gt;answer the basic question "Who decides what will be done with any given</i><br>
<i>&gt;resource?"  If your answer is that each individual always decides what to</i><br>
do
<br>
<a href="1833.html#1838qlink4">&gt;with the fruits of his own labor, you are on your way to a private property</a><br>
<i>&gt;system.  If you say that some other entity will always make the decision,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you are on the road to collectivism.  If you say that the answer depends on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the situation, then you are exploring the middle ground of socialism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
if the fruits of his own labor is some kind of hydrogen bomb I hope we will
all agree that we don't want him to be granted the choice of what to do
with...
<br>
I believe that only madmans aren't at least socialists in the kind of
partition you propose...
<br>
of course most of the time I believe in property rights...

<p>
<a href="1833.html#1838qlink5">&gt;So, if you reject all of these alternatives, I must ask how you propose</a><br>
that
<br>
<a href="1833.html#1838qlink6">&gt;such decisions should be made.</a><br>
