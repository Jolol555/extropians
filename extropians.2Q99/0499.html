<p>
Grey Gooies,

<p>
As much as I respect your desire for mastering new technologies to 
commit diabolically evil deeds, I must say that this plot to destroy 
the world with grey goo cannot be tolerated by me!  For you see I am 
the greatest mind in the world, and so it is my rightful destiny to 
rule the world!  And how can I be doing that if you turn to goo the 
entire universe??

<p>
Respectfully yours,

<p>
The Brain (of "Pinky and the Brain!")



<p>
Lyle,

<p>
I just want to say how hilariously funny I found your grey goo 
parody!  You have a real gift for this type of thing.  I think that 
humor even has a place on the Extropian list since so much discussed 
is very deep and technical, so people need something to occasionally 
lighten things.  I wish that others could take in good humor your 
gentle pokes at things.  I don't think that you mean any harm.  I 
think that posthuman scholars centuries from now will include your 
parodies in their works to show the humanity of the time.  

<p>
I liked Eleizer's idea of a list to reach out to the rich and 
powerful, even though I wonder how many of them would be interested.  
Most as far as I know do not even want to sign up for cryonic 
suspension!  

<p>
The extropian song that Eleizer wrote while suffering sleep 
deprivation at a con was brilliant!  I printed it up and put it in my 
scrapbook.  If I make it to the Extro 4 I hope that a band can be put 
together to perform it!  Or we can just put together an extropian 
choir out of the membership!

<p>
<a name="0512qlink2">Well, keep up the good work Lyle!  You should have a regular "column" 
here for the comedic talents.  Give it time and you will get a Hasty 
Pudding award!</a>

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
