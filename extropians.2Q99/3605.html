UCLA PLANS TO TRACK INTERNET'S LONG-TERM EFFECT ON SOCIETY
UCLA today will announce plans to conduct a decades-long survey of the
Internet's social impact in as many as 18 countries. Thousands of households
will participate in the study, which is receiving corporate backing from
AOL, Microsoft, Walt Disney, Sony, and others. Costs for the study are
expected to run upwards of $800,000 per year. UCLA's Center for
Communication Policy is overseeing the study. The study will focus in
particular on how households with Internet access differ from those that do
not; research shows that less than 25 percent of U.S. households have
Internet access. Two thousand U.S. households will participate in the first
phase of the survey, which kicks off within six weeks. Organizations in
Italy and Singapore will participate in the study in its first year, and
some 15 other countries will likely join them within five years, says
Jeffrey Cole, director of UCLA's communication policy center. (Los Angeles
