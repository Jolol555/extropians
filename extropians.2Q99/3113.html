Cynthia, please remember that from the perspective of just a few years
down the road, you yourself are in pretty poor condition by any
standards you care to name.

<p>
People are never defective.  We can be crippled.  We can be hurt.  We
can be twisted.  We can be born that way, because of genes or prenatal
problems; we can get hit on the head; we can even be hurt because of our
own choices.  But people are never, ever defective, not even if they've
been in a coma since birth, because people are not tools or parts or
anything else that can be "defective" by failing to serve your purpose. 
People have their own purposes.  A gamepiece can be defective.  Never a player.

<p>
"Defective" does not apply to game-theoretical agents.
