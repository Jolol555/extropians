I'm afraid the neurophon is a fraud.  The information you pointed to
contains several clear indicators of this:


<OL>
  <li>  The 'explanation' of how it works is so vague as to be meaningless.

  <li>  It is claimed that it functions via 'telepathy', yet the author gives no
evidence in support of this extraordinary claim.  In fact, he acts as if
there were nothing unusual about it.

  <li>  The device was supposedly covered up by the military.  Now, what possible
military necessity could lead to a hearing aid being declared classified?</a>

<a name="1235qlink1">  <li>  On the same item, there is no 'Defense Intelligence Agency' - and if this
had really happened, you'd think they would give the actual name of the
agency responsible.</a>

  <li>  The device is supposed to have been public knowledge since at least 1994.
Somehow, I think the invention of a miraculous, universal artificial ear
would have made both the mainstream press and the medical literature by now.

  <li>  A whole laundry list of unrelated, and improbable, benifits are claimed
for the device (including super learning, pain control and 'enhanced psychic
powers').

  <li>  The same page refers to all sorts of unrelated pseudoscience as if it
were real.

  <li>  The page is hosted by a site devoted to promoting into psychic phenomena,
channeling, UFOlogy, alien technology, new age spiritualism and related
topics.  While that doens't automatically mean that everything therein is
false, it does mean that any unusual claims should be viewed with the utmost
scepticism.  In light of the warning signs mentioned above, I can see no
good reason to think the neurophon story is any different from their tales
about psychic explorations of ancient Atlantean super-technology.
