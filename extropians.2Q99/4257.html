Ok, let's suppose that I install SoftWindows on an Alpha workstation. All
the software does is automatically predict what the PC output would look
like, and then display its prediction on-screen. Is the PC still running
Windows?

<p>
Or further; the Pentium-II seems to be basically a RISC chip with a frontend
which translates 80x86 instructions into RISC instructions. All the RISC
chip does is predict what a real 80x86 would do and output what it thinks
the real chip would do. Is the Pentium-II still running Windows?

<p>
Or is this entire question meaningless?

If the output is identical to that of the brain its</a> modelling, then the
entire system is effectively a 'conscious' brain.
