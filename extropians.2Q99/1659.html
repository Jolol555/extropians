If you do it right, you might be able to re-train your brain to process data
from a frequency-shifted sensor (and IR camera, or an ultrasound sensor).
You might even be able to adapt to a relatively alien sense, if it is
reformatted to be similar to a sense you already have (sonar vision, for
example).  What you can't do is process this data *in addition to* your
normal sensory input.

<p>
You only have so many neurons, and each neuron can only do so much work.
Advanced sensors can easily increase the amount of raw sensory data flowing
into your brain by many, many orders of magnitude.  The only way to cope
with the increased flow of data is an equally large increase in raw
processing power, in the form of genetically engineered "super neurons",
implant computers, datalinks to external computing devices, or some other
physical modification.
