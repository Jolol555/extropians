And just how the heck did "date rape" get into your message header? It
ahd nothing to do with this thread. I refer you to the portion of
Lorrey's message to which I replied:


<p>
<a href="2634.html#2655qlink1">&gt;I take the opposite view. Arming everyone with tazers that you know won't kill anyone</a><br>
<i>&gt;will make people shock happy, preferring to shock first and ask questions later,</i><br>
<i>&gt;because its easier than dealing with a confrontation and coming to a resolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Women will shock men at the end of a date cause they don't want to go through the</i><br>
<i>&gt;unpleasantness of telling the guy to buzz off and risk a bad response to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;rejection.</i><br>

<p>
Nope, no date rape there.....
<br>
This is just some bizarre scenario proposed by Lorrey wherein instead
of dealing with a slightly unpleasant brushoff when asked to return to
his apartment, or perhaps in order to pre-empt a request for another
date, the woman would simply taser her date....
