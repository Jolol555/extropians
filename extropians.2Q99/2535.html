Because it will leave those people defenceless and over time it will be
exploited to remove weapons from the hands of everyone outside the 
government? Joe, for example, has told us that all Republicans should be
disarmed, as in his opinion they're all mad...</a> who gets to decide what

<a name="2556qlink3">There are two stable situations with weapon ownership: either anyone can
own and carry anything they like (the traditional American ideal), or we're 
all locked away in padded cells under continual surveillance for our own 
safety (the British ideal). Any attempt to create an intermediate state 
will fail, with society heading towards one of the extremes; this is why
we can't have a 'reasonable compromise' on this issue.
