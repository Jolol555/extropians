Dear John,

<p>
I received your post and will respond when I have some free time.

<p>
Cheers!

<i>&gt;Hi!,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0317.html#0334qlink1">&gt;I just wanted to say hello.  Recently I have been reading all I can on </a><br>
<i>&gt;the net about cryonics, transhumanism, extropianism, nanotech, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;future forecasting.  And I have learned about the notable people in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the movements such as Drexler, Sandberg, Ettinger, Merkle, Platt, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;More.  I find it all very thrilling!  The width and breadth of </i><br>
<i>&gt;Ander's Transhuman website is incredible.  The concepts you espouse </i><br>
<i>&gt;are truly mind boggling.  I have read "The Engines of Creation" and </i><br>
<i>&gt;"The Prospects for Immortality" so far, and look forward to reading </i><br>
<i>&gt;"Create/Uncreate" by Natasha-Vita More.      </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am only thirty-one, but do not feel I have gotten my "money's worth" </i><br>
<i>&gt;out of my youth due to physical and psychosocial problems that I have. </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am not goodlooking (not ugly either, and I am tall, 6'1 but only </i><br>
<i>&gt;145 lbs.!), and grew up poor so woman largely ignore me compared to </i><br>
<i>&gt;the physically attractive and $$$ endowed males.  I want my </i><br>
<i>&gt;chance, and by the time I have a degree, decent job and money for </i><br>
<i>&gt;cosmetic surgery my youth will be gone. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I had a cool phone conversation with Charles Platt several years ago. </i><br>
<i>&gt; At the time I had no idea who he actually was.  I recently emailed </i><br>
<i>&gt;him and got back a warm reply, he actually remembered who I was.  He </i><br>
<i>&gt;has certainly been busy with Cryocare.  I was very impressed by his </i><br>
<i>&gt;contest held in Omni; a better person could not have been found to </i><br>
<i>&gt;give the prize of a cryonics membership.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The caliber, and intellect of those committed to extropianism and </i><br>
<i>&gt;cryonics impresses me.  The scientific discussions I encounter in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;extropian digest sometimes go over my head but I am learning a lot.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Though the arguements about gun control and air crashes do drag on </i><br>
<i>&gt;just a little!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If I were not a financially strapped student I would love to attend </i><br>
<i>&gt;Extro 4!  It would be very cool to meet all the people that I have </i><br>
<i>&gt;been reading about on the net.  And the lectures must all be </i><br>
<i>&gt;excellent.  One day I will make it, if not this time.  One problem </i><br>
<i>&gt;about living in Alaska is that you can't just hop in a car or bus and </i><br>
<i>&gt;a few hours later be in another state!  But you understand that being </i><br>
<i>&gt;in England, but then you must have your own conferences.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I live in Anchorage and attend the University of Alaska Anchorage as </i><br>
<i>&gt;a sophomore.  My major is history at this point, though I have thought </i><br>
<i>&gt;of going into human services.  I sadly did not get the math/science </i><br>
<i>&gt;gene some of my relatives have!  I still don't even have a driver's </i><br>
<i>&gt;licene, I took driver's ed but did not do to well.  Not having a </i><br>
<i>&gt;license has made my life in terms of career and romance very </i><br>
<i>&gt;frustrating.  When I tried to learn the martial arts I frustrated my </i><br>
<i>&gt;instructors because my sensory-motor memory and processing is so bad! </i><br>
<i>&gt; So I can't even learn how to defend myself well.  Generally I am a </i><br>
<i>&gt;slower then normal learner.  I wound up withdrawing from a college </i><br>
<i>&gt;math class because I was getting lost.  In a world where the ability </i><br>
<i>&gt;to learn is of the highest importance I am in a bad position.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The film "Lawnmower Man" made a huge impression on me.  It is still </i><br>
<i>&gt;one of my all time favorite movies.  Being that I am seriously </i><br>
<i>&gt;learning disabled the idea of transcending oneself like that utterly </i><br>
<i>&gt;grabbed me.  I wanted to jump into the film and take one of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;treatments myself.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I suffer from serious clinical depression which runs in my family.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;The depression makes me feel very weighed down' I just don't feel like </i><br>
<i>&gt;doing anything.  I have tried various antidepressants but not found </i><br>
<i>&gt;one to stick to yet.  Part of this is my fault because I tend to quit </i><br>
<i>&gt;them when side effects show up or when I run out of money.  Right now </i><br>
<i>&gt;I am on Effexor time release and plan to stick it out.  I have read </i><br>
<i>&gt;the book, "Listening to Prozac" and hope to undergo the same type of </i><br>
<i>&gt;transformation that his patients did in the book.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A major difficulty is that I don't have a burning passion.  I do like </i><br>
<i>&gt;studying history with the hope of becoming a teacher, but I am not on </i><br>
<i>&gt;fire for it.  I am afraid of committing myself to the wrong career </i><br>
<i>&gt;path.  But maybe as my depression clears I will find it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Though Alaska is great in the summer, the long dark winters really get </i><br>
<i>&gt;me down.  I think down the road I may move out of state to improve my </i><br>
<i>&gt;life.  This is a  city where you need a car because of a lousy bus </i><br>
<i>&gt;system, snowy, icy, cold climate, and how everything is spread out.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To top things off a.d.d. afflicts me.  It is only really apparent to </i><br>
<i>&gt;me I think.  I have a hard time focusing, especially in classes with </i><br>
<i>&gt;long lectures.  But I also have a problem focusing on a task, while </i><br>
<i>&gt;instead I find myself pacing.  I think that part of my problem is </i><br>
<i>&gt;self-discipline to do the things I need to, but at the same time my </i><br>
<i>&gt;other problems make it very hard to make progress.  I asked my doctor </i><br>
<i>&gt;for ritalin but he balked because of possible negative government </i><br>
<i>&gt;oversight of such things.  I have limited funds but I think it might </i><br>
<i>&gt;help me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I always sensed that I had problems.  But recently I was tested by a </i><br>
<i>&gt;neuropsychologist who verified my beliefs completely.  He felt that </i><br>
<i>&gt;the depression was the worst problem for me.  Despite this </i><br>
<i>&gt;professional diagnosis I still have friends who don't believe any of </i><br>
<i>&gt;it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;These problems were greatly compounded by my father who walked out on </i><br>
<i>&gt;my family.  While I grew up in a poor home needing him, he worked at a </i><br>
<i>&gt;job as a resort critic traveling the globe.  For him the major goal in </i><br>
<i>&gt;life was to have fun and sleep with as many women as he could.  With </i><br>
<i>&gt;his good looks that I did not inherit he carried out that goal very </i><br>
<i>&gt;well.  Despite all this I hired a company to track him down for me.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;To my surprise they found him so I made contact.  Cheap, powerful </i><br>
<i>&gt;computing made it possible for me to inexpensively find him.  he was </i><br>
<i>&gt;thrilled to hear from me; old age and retirement had humbled him </i><br>
<i>&gt;somewhat.  We are friends now, with him in the big apple and me in </i><br>
<i>&gt;Anchorage.  He never apologized, but where would he start?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have learned painfully about rejection from women who would date me, </i><br>
<i>&gt;but not take me seriously because of my lack of worldly success.  This </i><br>
<i>&gt;has caused me some of the greatest emotional pain of my life.  But </i><br>
<i>&gt;then I have read books on sociobiology in regards to human behavior.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;The human courtship ritual with its social currencies in the balance </i><br>
<i>&gt;can be cruel.  I just don't have enough social currency dollars to </i><br>
<i>&gt;make a purchase.  So many times I have felt so enraged and frustrated </i><br>
<i>&gt;over my genetic failings.  To think I have relatives who are </i><br>
<i>&gt;engineers.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I feel that with my thorns in the flesh I have been cheated out of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;potential I should have had.  I have a great deal of frustration over </i><br>
<i>&gt;all my wasted years.  Most men my age have a degree, good job, and car </i><br>
<i>&gt;at this point in their life with which to enjoy life, and attract a </i><br>
<i>&gt;mate.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To me cryonics offers a chance to experience life like I should have </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the first place.  I wish for the doctors of the future to wipe away </i><br>
<i>&gt;my genetic imperfections.  I feel anger and God and life for being </i><br>
<i>&gt;like this, though I experience guilt over that sometimes.  I am told </i><br>
<i>&gt;that in the  everything will be remedied, which I believe, but I want </i><br>
<i>&gt;my chance in this world.   Most of the very people who tell me things </i><br>
<i>&gt;will work out are ones who have no l.d., a.d.d., and depression to </i><br>
<i>&gt;hold them back from their goals.  They drive, have degrees and good </i><br>
<i>&gt;jobs, make love, and have general satisfaction in their lives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I believe in God but I feel like I have a lack of faith to want to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;suspended.  If the fundamentalist view of  prophecy is true then my </i><br>
<i>&gt;frozen body may will be destroyed in the geological and social turmoil </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the last days before the second coming of Christ.  Then I will wind </i><br>
<i>&gt;up facing God in judgement having cowardly tried to avoid him by </i><br>
<i>&gt;suspended.  The test of my faith for him would be to let nature take </i><br>
<i>&gt;it's course and cause me to die naturally.  When I read about the life </i><br>
<i>&gt;and example of Jesus I feel touched and believe that there must be a </i><br>
<i>&gt;literal truth to it.  I feel that either dismiss your beliefs or my </i><br>
<i>&gt;own would be a mistake.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I find comfort in the belief of a loving God who has this life as sort </i><br>
<i>&gt;of a "boot camp" experience for us to be prepared for the next.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Though not always pleasant, we are here to learn and grow.  Part of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the trial of life is that things at least right now are so unfair.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;But I believe that for those who try to live God's way his spirit will </i><br>
<i>&gt;be given to them to comfort and strengthen them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am not evangelical but mormon.  Our belief that men and women in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;next life become gods borders on the extropian.  For this belief we </i><br>
<i>&gt;have been vilified by some evangelicals.  We also believe that men and </i><br>
<i>&gt;women are the literal children of God, and that in a "premortal life" </i><br>
<i>&gt;we lived with him and learned and grew there.  We believe that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;talents that people sometimes just naturally seem to have were first </i><br>
<i>&gt;developed there and so in this life to a certain extent we are </i><br>
<i>&gt;rediscovering them.   And we have the belief in </i><br>
<i>&gt;marriage having the chance to last for all time and eternity when the </i><br>
<i>&gt;bond is sealed in one of our temples and the couple live God's way.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;To me this is a very powerful and romantic notion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I almost look at cryonic suspension like I do the exhortation of my </i><br>
<i>&gt;church leaders to have a two years supply of food and supplies for </i><br>
<i>&gt;times of emergency.  I just have a hard time imagining how I would </i><br>
<i>&gt;explain to a future wife why a cryonics firm and not she and the kids </i><br>
<i>&gt;are the beneficiary of my life insurance policy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The human lifespan is just too short!!  I want to be able to "look </i><br>
<i>&gt;over the horizon" in the coming century.  Even if I lived to be ninety </i><br>
<i>&gt;that would not be long enough to have a solid feel for who really had </i><br>
<i>&gt;the truth, and where the world was headed.  This world is so unfair in </i><br>
<i>&gt;parcelling out beauty, wealth, and talent.  I want to live in an age </i><br>
<i>&gt;where the playing field is much more  out.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am thinking seriously of transferring to a mormon college, Brigham  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Young-Hawaii campus.  Maybe I will find a woman there who will take a </i><br>
<i>&gt;chance on me.  But before I do that I need to get my grades up and </i><br>
<i>&gt;finances in order.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Due to an F grade and two incompletes over two semesters it looks </i><br>
<i>&gt;like I may lose </i><br>
<i>&gt;my student loans, and so no more school.  I have really shot myself in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the foot.  My whole  is only about 2.3 right now.  I know I should </i><br>
<i>&gt;have done much better.  Part of the problem is my disorganization, </i><br>
<i>&gt;l.d., a.d.d., and depression.  I must force myself to put forth much </i><br>
<i>&gt;more self-discipline, and manage my time and resources well.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Originally I wanted to wanted to start college by taking an intensive </i><br>
<i>&gt;remedial program to bone up on the academic basics.  But I tested high </i><br>
<i>&gt;so they strongly recommended that I go into deeper waters.  I think </i><br>
<i>&gt;back on it and think I would have had a smoother ride if I had </i><br>
<i>&gt;insisted to stay in the program.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I remember being a young man reading a children's Bible.  I read the </i><br>
<i>&gt;passage about how before the flood humans lived for many centuries!  I </i><br>
<i>&gt;brought it up to my mother's attention that I wished people still did, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and she agreed with me.  That moment planted a seed somehow.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am very impressed with Cryocare and Biopreservation.  The efforts </i><br>
<i>&gt;and results of Mike Darwin and his colleagues to improve suspension </i><br>
<i>&gt;techniques are of the highest caliber.  I was taken by how in his </i><br>
<i>&gt;writings he is open about the damage that happens to the brain by </i><br>
<i>&gt;conventional suspension methods.  I would not want to be one of those </i><br>
<i>&gt;people already suspended.  Fortunately I have hopefully three or four </i><br>
<i>&gt;more decades ahead of me for the technology to mature.  By the time </i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm ready, the technology should be ready.  The research being done by </i><br>
<i>&gt;21st Century Medicine will revolutionize how suspensions are done!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cryocare people claim Alcor is not the equal of Biopreservation  in </i><br>
<i>&gt;suspension technology.  I just hope Alcor and the other groups adopt </i><br>
<i>&gt;all the new methods for suspension used by Biopreservation.  The </i><br>
<i>&gt;decentralized structure of Cryocare should make it less vulnerable to </i><br>
<i>&gt;institutional entropy.  At least though Alcor and CI is outside of </i><br>
<i>&gt;California, so when and if the big one hits you will not be a cryonic </i><br>
<i>&gt;casualty.  I would like Cryocare to manage me, Biopreservation to </i><br>
<i>&gt;suspend, and Alcor or CI to store.  I plan to ask for </i><br>
<i>&gt;neuropreservation if it is true that to optimize brain suspension you </i><br>
<i>&gt;should remove the head from the body.  Though if inflation totally </i><br>
<i>&gt;devalues my indexed life insurance policy over time I may wind up </i><br>
<i>&gt;having to go with CI!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It does bother me how relatively few people are signed up.  But in </i><br>
<i>&gt;time I think there will be a major change there.  To promote cryonics </i><br>
<i>&gt;and  has any of the leadership gone on the Art Bell radio show?  I </i><br>
<i>&gt;would assume by now it has been done, but if not it would be a great </i><br>
<i>&gt;way to reach millions.  The man's ability to sway the public is </i><br>
<i>&gt;powerful.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can't wait till the Hallmark made for t.v. movie version of "The </i><br>
<i>&gt;First Immortal" comes out!  Considering the quality of Hallmark </i><br>
<i>&gt;productions, and the fact that the director of "Lonesome Dove" is </i><br>
<i>&gt;doing the movie it should be fantastic.  I think the release of this </i><br>
<i>&gt;will be the huge turning point in public opinion that you are looking </i><br>
<i>&gt;for.  Be ready to be swamped afterwards with public interest.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Personally I wish that having lived my life and being in my early </i><br>
<i>&gt;seventies I could go to my suspension provider and with the right </i><br>
<i>&gt;legal documents ask them to induce clinical death so they could on the </i><br>
<i>&gt;spot suspend me!  I don't like the idea of waiting around to die and </i><br>
<i>&gt;then finally passing away unexpectedly only to have my brain decay for </i><br>
<i>&gt;several hours or even days.  Mike Darwin's research made this point </i><br>
<i>&gt;crystal clear.  I think that I should have the right to do this, since </i><br>
<i>&gt;it is not by my definition suicide, but instead a calculated risk.  I </i><br>
<i>&gt;realize that some disability rights organizations are militantly </i><br>
<i>&gt;against right to die because they feel that down the road they may be </i><br>
<i>&gt;targeted by society as the unfit that should be coerced to their </i><br>
<i>&gt;deaths.  But I honestly don't see this happening.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am concerned that while the doctors of the future will reanimate us </i><br>
<i>&gt;in perfected versions of our selves, that they may not to upgrade us </i><br>
<i>&gt;to their level of intellect and functioning.  This may be because they </i><br>
<i>&gt;can't, (to be more like them may take modification at the early stage </i><br>
<i>&gt;of being a zygote) or because they feel that it would be more </i><br>
<i>&gt;interesting to see us try to survive in their society as limited </i><br>
<i>&gt;beings for the sake of sociological study.  Our hope would would have </i><br>
<i>&gt;to be that in time things would </i><br>
<i>&gt;change technologically and socially.  At least the reanimated would </i><br>
<i>&gt;have each other for company.  If suspension were available for me </i><br>
<i>&gt;alone I would reject it.  I want others from my time to associate </i><br>
<i>&gt;with.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Prometheus Project has really got my interest.  It bothers me that </i><br>
<i>&gt;they are underfunded at this point.  I wonder though if they could </i><br>
<i>&gt;really pull off their objective even with twenty million raised over a </i><br>
<i>&gt;number of years.  With all the billions wasted by governments </i><br>
<i>&gt;worldwide it bothers me that the project leaders must almost go </i><br>
<i>&gt;begging for such important work.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I read an interview with the </i><br>
<i>&gt;president and owner of Oracle computing, who is worth over six </i><br>
<i>&gt;billion.  I don't recall his name, but in the article he seemed to </i><br>
<i>&gt;have the type of personality that might be intrigued by the project.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;But of course even getting near the man to submit a proposal would be </i><br>
<i>&gt;another story.  I can see why Eleizer would want to start a digest to </i><br>
<i>&gt;attract the wealthy.  I admit I would love to subscribe to it just to </i><br>
<i>&gt;see how things progress.  Unless I really felt I had something to add </i><br>
<i>&gt;I would be silent.  In fact you could have two levels of subscribers, </i><br>
<i>&gt;those who can input, and those who can't.  I would be content to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;the latter.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What we should really do is have one of us meet that brilliant young </i><br>
<i>&gt;boy that Bill Gates took under his wing to educate and mold.  If a </i><br>
<i>&gt;reporter could get to him while the bodyguard was in the bathroom </i><br>
<i>&gt;maybe one of us could do the same.  In a few minutes of conversation </i><br>
<i>&gt;and some pamphlets with basic info and website addresses we could </i><br>
<i>&gt;implant in the mind of this possible future multimillionaire the memes </i><br>
<i>&gt;that could change his own future for good and our own.  Think if Bill </i><br>
<i>&gt;Gates had been reached as a young man by an early follower of </i><br>
<i>&gt;Ettinger!  Gates probably at this point is close minded about us and </i><br>
<i>&gt;the possiblity of donations, but there is hope with his possible </i><br>
<i>&gt;protege.  Ten or fifteen years from now the reaching out of one of us </i><br>
<i>&gt;to him could pay enormous dividends to a group like The Prometheus </i><br>
<i>&gt;Project.  I implore Max More and Natasha, along with everyone else to </i><br>
<i>&gt;consider this.  It is time to hatch a plan!  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I especially like the Prometheus Project because I have some nagging </i><br>
<i>&gt;doubts about nanotech.  This began to develop after reading an article </i><br>
<i>&gt;by an actual researcher in the field who wrote an article in "The </i><br>
<i>&gt;Scientific American".  He said the reality of the situation is that </i><br>
<i>&gt;there are huge obstacles to Drexler's ideas. Making mechanisms work </i><br>
<i>&gt;like we want them</i><br>
<i>&gt;to do at such small dimensions is extremely frustrating he claimed.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;He even called those who thought  would in time transform the world </i><br>
<i>&gt;believers in "cargo cult" misguided thinking.  But perhaps over time </i><br>
<i>&gt;and with the present impressive funding levels for research the </i><br>
<i>&gt;barriers can be overcome.  Isn't corporate and national rivalry just </i><br>
<i>&gt;great sometimes?  Can't let that untrustworthy rival get the upper </i><br>
<i>&gt;hand!  Now if only cryonics and longevity research could get such </i><br>
<i>&gt;reactions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am very impressed by the three prominent women of extropianism, </i><br>
<i>&gt;Natasha-Vita More(aestheticgirl!), Gina Miller(nanogirl!), and Romana </i><br>
<i>&gt;Machado(leathergirl!).  Even though certainly they are no longer girls </i><br>
<i>&gt;but mature, and very gifted and intelligent women.  I am going to have </i><br>
<i>&gt;to really improve myself to be worthy of the women of the future if </i><br>
<i>&gt;they resemble these ladies!      </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well everyone, I just want to thank you for listening to all my </i><br>
<i>&gt;ramblings.  It felt good to get it all out.  I hope things are going </i><br>
<i>&gt;great for you all!  I look forward to your replies and wish you all </i><br>
<i>&gt;the best.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe one day we will all get to attend that party at the edge of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;galaxy they talk about or another party sometime sooner.  I am really </i><br>
<i>&gt;going to try to attend Extro 4 if I can manage.  I realize that I am </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the presence of intellects far greater then my own on the digest </i><br>
<i>&gt;and I am somewhat intimidated at times, but at least I am learning and </i><br>
<i>&gt;enjoying myself.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
