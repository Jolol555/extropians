<a href="2144.html#2156qlink1">&gt; Bad news, Brian.  Second Amendment was written during a time when people</a><br>
<i>&gt; carried flint-lock muzzle-loaders, when they were concerned with British</i><br>
<i>&gt; troops crashing down the front door, when armed combat was an honorable</i><br>
<i>&gt; affair.  Unfortunately, the Second Amendment is one of the only Amendments</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the Constitution that has not properly stood the tests of time.</i><br>

<p>
A common misconception.  At the time, private citizens owned fullscale
 warships with cannons, and many wealthy estates had armories
full of guns and bombs a Montana survivalist would envy.  The idea
that a government-run army should be the only one to have such
things was precisely the sort of tyranny we fought against. 


<p>
Now I say:
<br>
Also at the time, the army was made up of the entire supporting populace.
So it wasn't incredible for a wealthy 'private citizen' to own his own
warships, it was actually seen as an advantage, and he was usually made a
General.  Also, if a Montana survivalist starts grabbing at mortar from the
18th century and flint-locks, then they are obviously delusional.  So the
problem here isn't how much they had, but what they were packing.  There's a
difference between a muzzle-loader that takes 25 seconds to reload and an
UZI with an extended clip and a grenade launcher strapped to your back.
