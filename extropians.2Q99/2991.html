<p>
Of course, if citizens don't sell guns to criminals, the cops will happily
take up that 'lucrative business'. A BATF survey of crimes committed with
guns in DC a few years ago showed that around 40% of the guns had been 
stolen from police evidence rooms.</a>

You will, of course, cite a reference to this incident? No, you won't, will
you, because it never happened.</a> If you're referring to the Japanese student
<a name="3001qlink3">killed in Texas, the gun owner was taken to court and the jury decided it
was a justified killing. You'd have thought that if gun owners were as 
irrational and trigger-happy as you make out, a jury would have decided
otherwise, wouldn't</a> you?

<p>
That's what you get when you try to keep guns away from kids and don't teach
them firearms safety; numerous studies have shown that kids who grow up 
around guns and shoot them with their relatives are the least likely to be
involved in a shooting accident. If this really concerns you, why aren't you
pushing for more gun safety classes?</a>

<i>&gt;SOMETHING.</i><br>

<p>
Ho hum, emotional rhetoric, yes, that's really going to convince people. BTW,
the number of murders and the number of shooting accidents (which often
include suicides classified as 'accidents' by the cops for various reasons)
have been going down for years; so why is this 'clearly out of control'?</a></a>
