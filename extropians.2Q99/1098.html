<a name="1102qlink2">If I may presume to reply to my own post, I think I can state much more
succinctly, my point:  We moderns already spend waaaay too much time
and effort, searching searching searching ancient texts for answers to today's
dilemmas.  I really mean that.  If we could somehow resurrect the most
famous wise guys of the past, Confucius, Moses, Solomon, Socrates, Jesus,
Maimonides, Nostradamus, etc, these guys would be *just as clueless as
we are* to solve some of today's questions.  We need to find the answers
ourselves!  Not look back.  They can't help.  Look forward, not back.  spike
