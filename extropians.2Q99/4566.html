Actually, I guess, in an abstract sense, this is a very appropriate
qeustion for this Extropian forum. After all, being able to control
own own motivations and what makes us happy will be one of the great
benefits granted us by medical science in the distant future. 

<p>
With complete control of our own hormones, we could warp our sex
drives in incredible ways, e.g., set ourselves up to have an orgasm
after we write a pleasing page of prose, or after writing a nice
computer program function, or creating an efficient electronic
circuit, etc. Imagine the productivity gains.

<p>
And I guess this leads us to what one of the common themes of
naysayers who claim  that immortality will not be all it might seem to
be, since they often claim that immortals will grow borerd. I always
reply that if mankind is ever able to affect physical immortality,
then surely control of hormones, etc., would ensure that if we wnat to
be happy, we can then BE happy, whenever and for how long it pleases
us to be happy.
