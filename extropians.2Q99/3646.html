<a name="3662qlink1">I personally think all this talk about the happy smoke is a travesty!  All 
you people bad mouthin' givin' it a bad name.  I have personally</a> been smoking 
<a name="3662qlink2">for 15 years and have suffered no ill effects.  Like the other day, I was 
feelin' a bit under the weather cause it was so hot.  Well, I lit up a big 
fat doobie and stuck my head in the freezer for about an hour.  After</a> I had 
<a name="3662qlink3">sufficiently cooled off, I made myself a big ol' plate of porkchops and 
stuffed em in my juicer.  Boy I tell you there ain't nothing</a> more refreshing 
<a name="3662qlink4">on a hot summer day than a big ol' glass of porkchop.  So don't go tellin'</a> me 
<a name="3662qlink5">that guns are the reason for all this madcow disease.  Like the other</a> day I 
<a name="3662qlink6">was feelin' a bit under the weather on a count of it was so hot outside.  
Would you know I spent almost 2 hours with my head in the toilet.</a>  So don't 
<a name="3662qlink7">go tellin me about midgets with guns don't have rights.
