<p>
Perhaps not, but sometimes there are no simple solutions. Switching to a 
healthy lifestyle alone doesn't make you hang on forever.

Are we speaking about pointless cruelty towards the elderly here, 
or about specially constructed cases?

<p>
Larry Niven is a science fiction author*. Of what possible interest can 
be his opinion about head-freezing?

<p>
What are the other options other than going corpsicle postmortem? I don't
see any other ones than wind up any other than a yet another
carcass/calcinated ash heap.

<p>
<a href="0585.html#0592qlink5"> &gt; any cryonics facilities.</a><br>

<p>
If there is no cryonics outfit within a few hours operation window
(have you checked with CryoNet?) in your area then you might as well 
organize and found one. Current protocols are really lousy, and there 
won't be any better ones if there is no further funding. Imho,
currently there are few things as important as nanotechnology and
cryonics research.

<p>
P.S. *Not that I have anything against science fiction authors, quite
vice versa. However, few authors are well versed in cryobiology, nor,
alas, can they predict the future accurately.
