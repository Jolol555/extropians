<a href="4449.html#4463qlink1">&gt;&gt; If some folks are going to hold that science can't explain</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the subjective, then maybe there's no point in coming up with elaborate</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; schemes to prove that?</i><br>

<p>
correct: these folks are just plain constitutionally incapable of
understanding how phlogiston, ether, light, magnetism &amp; chemistry, and life
force all got reduced to heat, nothing, QED, and DNA respectively.
They also can't understand how a theory of the mind is possible. I am not
sure why, but having tried I accept now that it is impossible to convince
them otherwise - they can;t see it just like we can't hear bats. Sad but
true. Try not to have too many of them around you.

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;It seems that any scenario to prove the "failure"</i><br>
<a href="4449.html#4463qlink2">&gt;&gt; of science on this, is itself going to be a kind of science or</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; engineering or materials scenario, maybe even involving "ghost energy"</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of some sort? How can any materialist or realist scenario prove that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; realism is missing an essential component?</i><br>
They are unrealists - they don't have to prove anything - they assert it so
and that is proof. Just like Angela Dworkin claims that if any woman
anywhere, anytime, ever claims that a thing is pornographic, that that is
incontrovertible proof that that thing should be banned.
