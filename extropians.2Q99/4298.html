I don't know if that was one of the choices, but I came out as a "Prime 
Minister." I suspect we'd have a lot of those on this list.

I keep getting different M-B results. I am usually an INTJ or something 
close, and once I came out close to xxTx, which is like having no 
personality at all; and I have occasionally showed up as an ENT?. The T 
seems to be the main constant.

The interesting part of these exercises is (would be) learning how to guess 
what "type" another person is expressing, and how to tailor one's 
communication to that type. Next after that would be learning how to 
change types at will, which after all is just acting. This needs to be done 
with some subtlety to avoid too precise an emulation of MPD.
