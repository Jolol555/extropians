    Cows Cloned from Milk
<br>
Healthy Calves from Milk Right After Delivery 

 
<p>
The Associated Press
<br>
T O K Y O,   April 26 — Two calves cloned from cells found in cow’s 
milk have been born in northern Japan, officials said today. 
<p>
     The births last week at the Snow Brand dairy company’s research 
center in Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido were the first 
ever using colostrum — the milk produced in the first week after a 
cow has delivered, the company said in a statement. 
<p>
     The procedure could make it safer for animals to donate their 
cells for cloning, as the extraction of cells from milk does not 
require making an incision in the donor cow and reduces the risk of 
infection, Snow Brand said. 
<p>
     The cloned calves were produced by combining the nucleus of a 
mammary cell with an unfertilized egg and inserting the embryo into 
the uterus of a surrogate cow. It was the same method used to produce 
the sheep Dolly, the world’s first cloned animal. 
Two Out of Three Had Babies
<br>
Three cows were made pregnant through the technique, but only two 
succeeded in giving birth. One of the calves was delivered through 
Caesarean section on April 20 and the other was delivered naturally 
the following day, the company said. 
<p>
     Japan has recently been aggressively developing cloning 
techniques in order to maintain the competitiveness of its cattle 
industry by producing high quality beef at a cheap price. 
<p>
     A controversy erupted earlier this month after the government 
said that cloned beef has been on the market in Japan for at least 
two years, prompting protests from consumer groups worried about its 
safety. The government insists the meat poses no health threat. 
<p>
     Tokyo-based Snow Brand is Japan’s largest dairy product company, 
and has cloned several cows in the past.
