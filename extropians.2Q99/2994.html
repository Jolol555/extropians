If it did not involve bloody intentional mayhem, it's not news. It probably
made the local papers, though, right?

<p>
A local shop owner near here, in Crystal Lake, was shot to death by an
upstanding citizen who apparently disliked the fact that the shop owner was
of Japanese extraction. It got passing mention in the Chicago papers once,
on a middle page. The local papers are following the story pretty closely.

<p>
A similar case where a woman in a bakery thrift shop was shot by a 13 year
old got mentioned breifly in the Chicago Tribune mainly because the victim
pleaded for leiniency for her attacker. Again, the local papers are
covering ongoing details.

<p>
Only stuff on the level of Littleton CO. gets national attention, so that's
all that most people know about.
