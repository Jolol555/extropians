<p>
Unfortunately, such a "backward" country would also be unable to
prevent boarding by overzealous coast guard and naval gunships from
mighty nations, pirates, ecoactivists, churches, terrorists and your
stray smugglers.</a>

<p>
<a name="0111qlink2"><a href="0059.html#0097qlink2">&gt;would other countries give you any serious trouble?</a><br>

<p>
Let's see: Japan, Russia, the USA, the UK, France, Germany, Italy,
Spain, Portugal, Greece, the Netherlands, Denmark, Cuba... Did I
forget most Muslim nations?</a>

<p>
<a name="0111qlink3"><a href="0059.html#0097qlink3">&gt;What would their legal possibilities be for harassment (assuming you stay</a><br>
<i>&gt;in international waters all the time)?</i><br>

<p>
Add to the above Greenpeace, the Medellin cartel, the Roman Catholic
Church...

<p>
With the U.N. granting virtual letters of marque &amp; reprisal to any
member nation with their "crimes against humanity" rules, you'd also
be prey to any international conglomerate. There's no such thing as
"international waters" when it comes to pursuing individual courses of
action held anathema by U.N. members: for them, it just means "open
season for all."

<p>
<a name="0111qlink4"><i>&gt;Thoughts, anyone?</i><br>

<p>
Yes, and this isn't a joke. You might be safer finding just such a
willing nation and building the center on land.

<p>
You might even be able to convince a nation such as China to sponsor
you. Fairly dictatorial; but if they say it's fine with them, also
fairly safe from foreign intervention.</a>

<p>
<a name="0111qlink5"><a name="0107qlink1">Above all, consult with Scientologists: they're used to dealing with
legal harrassment concerning their health care choices. There might be
some states that might not prove as inimical to the concept</a> on the
USA.
</a>
<p>
<a name="0111qlink6">Another clue: unincorporated US territories aren't fully under federal
legislation. Sadly, the freest territory from US legislation is Puerto
RIco, which also happens to be rather socially conservative and
extremely centralized in local government affairs.
