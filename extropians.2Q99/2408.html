Huh? This sounds rather silly or mis-reported. As far as I can
understand, the detonation of a sub-micron pellet of TNT or whatever
is only going to create a sub-micron sized bubble (inside a bacterium
which is already elastic) - the reaction will not even be very quick
(huge surface area / volume ratio), and you are not likely to get
shock waves to do extra damage. It would probably work more by
poisoning the bacteria.

<p>
I could imagine something like liposomes as a vector for getting
something into cells, and it might even be possible (although I'm not
an expert) to coat them with immune-based proteins to make them
slightly selective for non-human cells. But it isn't nanotechnology in
the sense the original question was asked.
