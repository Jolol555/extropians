Rob, your post reminds me of a Richard Fish routine.  Deep down
in your heart, you know he is absolutely right.... {8^D

<p>
I will buy part of it.  You say rarely does a man accept
purely platonic relationships with female friends.  I strive
for these relationships, and have found them to be more
difficult and simultaneously more rewarding than friendships
with men.  Women tend to be better at expressing themselves.
My friendships with them have proved most enlightening.

Sure, but what if you are really really *not* looking for a shag?
What if you are happily married and do not want to risk everything?
Or what if she is the wife/sweetheart of your best friend?  Maybe
your theory of habitually kissing up to attractive women is
correct.  I shall ponder that and get back later.

Same sex friendships easier for some reason.

What if we could work it so that everyone was both genders
and every transhuman was a potential sex partner?  Could we then
still talk to each other?  Or would we all be constantly striving
for the next shag?  spike
