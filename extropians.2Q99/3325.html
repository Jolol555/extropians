The project had its conceptual beginnings in the 1970's, became a financial endeavor in 1985, broke ground in Southern Arizona in 1986, and completed construction in 1990.  The two year 'manned' stint was between 1991-1993. Having lived in Tucson and worked with some of the consulting scientists during the project, I'm quite informed about the details if you want to e-mail me directly for more info.
