Well, the pogrom is complete (only one propulsion scientist and one
systems analyst remain at Rotary aside from Bevin McKinney), it is
rumored that the ATV will do a hover test this week, and my former
boss' new business card reads in part:


<UL>
  <li>  Project Management
  <li>  Liquid Rocket Engines
  <li>  Launch Vehicle Design
  <li>  Experienced Team Available


</UL>

<a name="4651qlink1">I'd say our plans are pretty obvious.  For now, I have some
electronics consulting work, an interview this week at
Marconi/Tracor, and I'm working on an SBIR proposal. (I don't have
Walt Anderson's religious aversion to government contracts</a> :)

<p>
The "$900 million in launch contracts" that RRC allegedly has is
essentially funny money- the so-called customer is not specified,
but I'm guessing that it's LunaCorp.  Since LC is just a one-man
beltway bandit shop and RRC's Washington lobbyist, I'm skeptical.</a> 
Those launch contracts and $3.75 in cash will get you a cup of
coffee.

<p>
On rereading the above, it may seem theat Bevin was doing a power
grab; on the contrary, it was other people within the company that
wiped out most of Bevin's staff.  I enjoyed working with him (he was
my boss' boss), and respect him a lot.
