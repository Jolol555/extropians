Damien Broderick &lt;damien@ariel.ucs.unimelb.edu.au&gt; replied
&gt; Exactly. This is just Searle's Chinese Room by other means.

<p>
Except that Searle comes to exactly the OPPOSITE conclusion.
He says that there is no consciousness in this case. He explicitly denies
that if a result is computed by parts, then consciousness is a distributed
property of those parts.
<br>
That is his whole point - that is why he is so bitterly against
functionalists like Dennett.

It's a demonstration that you can't understand the philosophy of
the mind merely by virtue of being known as a philosopher of the mind.
