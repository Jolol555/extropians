<a href="3845.html#3867qlink1">&gt; Where I am going with this is if we have the choice in the future</a><br>
<i>&gt; of being both sexes simultaneously, as would be other transhumans,</i><br>
<i>&gt; what would that be like?  How would we communicate then?</i><br>
<i>&gt; What if we could work it so that everyone was both genders</i><br>
<i>&gt; and every transhuman was a potential sex partner?  Could we then</i><br>
<i>&gt; still talk to each other?  Or would we all be constantly striving</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the next shag?  spike</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I think sex would become even more recreational but less fun in comparison
with alternative forms of high tech entertainment. What would you do, knock
<a name="3880qlink1">some bird off for 20 minutes or take a spin in the holodeck?</a> Also, with
<a name="3880qlink2">everyone dual-gendered and full of transhuman wisdom, people would probably
be much "easier",</a> so you wouldn't have to twat about doing the "look how
good my genes are" dance for the females before you get your leg over......
