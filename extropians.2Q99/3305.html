<a name="3318qlink1">Now, now, guys; aren't y'all gittin' a bit "flamy" here (NOT to say light in 
the loafers!! ha ha)  Seriously, Joe, you need to calm the rhetoric DOWN a 
little.  I, too, generally sympathize with (most, anyway) of what MIke, 
Mark, Brian &amp; other "gun-nuts" (note the hell outta the scare-quotes) have 
argued.  Yet *I* don't advocate that the really, truly psycho should be able 
to access/possess guns (or any other lethal weapon(s) for that matter).  
Kids, though, are, at least to some extent, a gray area (and always have 
been, especially in libertarianism(s)).  Can a 14-yr. old (or even, say 
13-yr. old or 12-yr. old) have, say a .22 hunting rifle.  I say (at 
tentatively) YES! (The 14-yr., that is---I'm still all the more ambivalent 
about the younger ages).  But can a 14-yr. old rightly pack concealed 9mm 
heat down Main St.  Tentatively, I say NO--s/he's not mature enough; but I'm 
open to persuasion otherwise.

<a name="3318qlink2">But I still agree with your (Joe's) position(s) at the principle level, it's 
the pragmatic implementation that troubles me in some contexts.  So, again, 
I seem to sympathize/agree with all of the (personages) above.  So what's 
up?  Where's the beef?  Can't we all just get all??

<p>
Just some rif-ruminations on this particular rif of yours.

<p>
Best to all!
