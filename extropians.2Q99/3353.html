<i>&gt; &gt; Delightful story Anders!  Now what I most want to know is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; what such an audience's reaction would actually be.  For all I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; know about such people, they might be *more* receptive to this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; message than a gathering of anti-racists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps I commit the sin of stereotyping here, but I rather suspect that</i><br>
<i>&gt; your average racist, or at least your average Klan member, wants</i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody to feel superior to.  They aren't in it for a calm, peaceful</i><br>
<i>&gt; intention to improve the human race.  Racism is about hate.  Anders'</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientist would never have left the conference alive.</i><br>

<a name="3386qlink1">Unfortunately I agree with Eliezer. My (very limited) experience of
discussing with racists show that they are not particularly fond of
having their views of the world disturbed. However, I noted that they
are indeed rather susceptible to biological arguments, which makes
them even more upset when you start throwing some transhumanist ideas
at them. They usually retreat to cultural superiority instead, which
was the reason I had the Doctor add memetic engineering.

<p>
Seriously, I don't think we will be very successful at "curing"
racists by arguments like this. It is not much a question about
rationality but rather dealing with an emotional worldview. But
technologies like above may of course make that worldview ever more
untenable.</a>

If your neighbor is a cyborg, his skin color and accent will become
less relevant.
