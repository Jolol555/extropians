<a name="4232qlink1">Thanks for the explanation, Hal. I think I understand Eliezer's reasoning
now, but I have a couple of objections to it. First I think it is possible
to have a computational theory of consciousness (or qualia) that doesn't
depend on a definition of "instantiation of a computation". See for
example <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=325">http://www.</a>escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=325</a>.

<p>
<a name="4232qlink2">Second, even if we really do need either a definition of instantiation or
non-computable physics to explain qualia, I do not see sufficient reason
to believe that the latter is more likely to exist than the former. The
only justification I have seen is Eliezer's (and other's) failed attempts
to find such a definition. But people have presumably been trying to find
examples of non-computable physics also, and they have also failed so far.

<a name="4232qlink3">I hope Eliezer will explain to us which approaches he tried when he
attempted to find a definition of instantiation, why they failed, and why
he doesn't believe other approaches will eventually work. What about the
one given at <a href="http://pages.nyu.edu/~jqm1584/cwia.htm?">http://pages.nyu.edu/~jqm1584/cwia.htm?</a>
