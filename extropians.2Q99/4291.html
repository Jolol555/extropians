Here's a quickie:

<p>
In the seventh grade I picked up my mothers copy of the Illuminatus!
Trilogy,  and that's how it all began.  I read it 8 times through my high
school years - it became somewhat of a bible to me.  It also sparked
interest in other subjects.  I found a copy of the Principia Discordia
online and started an archive on Timothy Leary, which I someday hope to make
public.  My high school years also saw my interest peak in the culture of
"cyberpunk" - whatever that is.

<p>
Recently however,  since I've graduated from college and moved on to the
corporate world, I've been veering more toward the classics.  Joyce,
Nabokov, Kafka, and Dostoevsky... oddly enough, people I could identify
with.  

<p>
I think I might classify my favorite author as extropian - has anyone read
the fiction of Jeff Noon?  As a collector of Alice in Wonderland books,  I
thoroughly enjoyed his "Automated Alice".

<p>
And as for female authors,  I really haven't been exposed to many that I
could really stomach.  The Jane Austin's and Virginia Woolf's of the world
really inflicted some major damage during my college years.  Luckily I could
always turn to that one female that always understood me and "my kind" - St.
Jude.

<p>
That's all.
