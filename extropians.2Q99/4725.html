<a href="4694.html#4725qlink1">&gt;Also, there doesn't seem to be any evidence that youngsters of any </a><br>
<i>&gt;other species are harmed by seeing their adults naked, or engaging </i><br>
<i>&gt;in sexual acts. If humans are the only species whose children may </i><br>
<i>&gt;be harmed in this way, this may be explained only by the social </i><br>
<i>&gt;conditioning by those who claim that these things are bad.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4743qlink1">Of course children aren't harmed by sexual experience. I'm with you here.
The common dogma is utter excrement (as usual). Damaged in what way? Where
is the evidence? Why then do kids love to play "doctors and nurses"? I've
had a sex drive of varying magnitude for as long as I can remember, and I
certainly wouldn't have minded some horny bird paedophile giving me the
onceover when I was a kid, I can tell</a> you.
The pathetic attempt to blur the logic of the situation by the propagators
of this drivel lies in the labelling of all child sex as "rape", and
labelling of all paedophiles as evil. (Even though Paedophile merely means
"child lover", not rapist). The justification of this is that children
"don't know their own minds". On the contrary, the reality is that they
haven't been programmed yet, and know their minds all too well. It is the
adults who have lost their own minds under years of social programming.
