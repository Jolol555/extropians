I'm on the run at work for the rest of the week, so detailed response to any 
of the interesting stuff going on here will have to wait a few days, but I'd 
like to make a quick reply to Lyle's note about my flippant comment about 
Picasso and Ted Turner (what was I THINKING when I wrote THAT???).

<p>
My comment was not intended to indicate that the examples I gave were by any 
means self-consciously engaged in memetic engineering (although Picasso 
certainly was).  Rather, it was simply to indicate that "culture work" can be 
lucrative and/or influential in realms outside of the purely memetic realm of 
culture per se.  You certainly don't have to know what a "meme" is to do such 
things.

<p>
As for my discussion of making or not making money in the work of propagating 
memes (transhuman and extropian memes, in particular), my point was to 
communicate that such an effort is, in my opinion, part and parcel of 
bringing about a world that will produce the particular technological fruits 
of thetranshuman agenda we are pursuing.  But cf my point about "free 
riding": One doesn't necessarily have to an active meme-propagator to get at 
least some benefit from the efforts of others who are.
