<p>
Ah, but if it is natural selection, then it is not art. Art is created by
intention, not by accident. While there is much natural beauty in the world, one
does not call the Yosemite Valley 'art'. Images of the Yosemite Valley that are
created by man are art.

<p>
After my heated argument with art critic Matthew Kanga a couple years ago in
Seattle about 'computer art', I've often fantasized about developing a computer
printer that paints an image, just so I can stuff it in his face and have him do
a little Turing test. Asking someone what is art is much like asking someone what
is human: it tells much more about their prejudices than about the truth.
