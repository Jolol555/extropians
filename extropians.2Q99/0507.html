<p>
Because where high bandwidth is possible, more efficient forms of
organization will outcompete any effort to duplicate the galactic
organization on a single planet.  It is similar to the problem of a
civilization optimizing away all its spare room.  The shortsighted
approach always outcompetes.  Civilizations in the Slow Zone are
short-lived for the same reason humans are.

The Qeng Ho are sufficiently distributed in time, and sufficiently small
in crew, that they don't have a "commons problem" - at least, not on
more than one ship at a time.  The Qeng Ho are immortal for the same
reason amoebas are.

Because a star system has fully spread The Plague by the time anyone can
impose effective quarantine measures.  The time between stars is long
enough to eliminate sleeper viruses... either that, or at the time of
the novel, any sleeper viruses are still sleeping.
