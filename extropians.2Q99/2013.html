<a name="2018qlink1">I think you have that a bit backwards, violence, in any form is the
<br>
_last_ resort to be taken in resolving a conflict.<br>
I see no question of being 'enslaved' to a gun, a gun is merely another
tool, are you enslaved to your hair brush?
The point of gun ownership, aside from the pleasure of target (for
myself) or game shooting is a: To have that final option should a
situation arise that can't be
<pre>
                    dealt with in any other way.
                 b: In the US at least, as the last defense against the
tyranny of
                     government.

Despite what has been said previously on this thread the framers of the
Constitution were very forward thinking men attempting to create a
document that would stand the test of time. The fact that they were
unable to envision our current society in no way invalidates their
efforts, in fact the results of their labor have stood up very well.
