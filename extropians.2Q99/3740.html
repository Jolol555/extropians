Actually, I thought this was consistent.  Some of the crew expressed a
desire to go to the Alpha quadrant and continue with their lives.  Other
crew members pointed out that Starfleet would never accept alien
replacements for their officers, so their careers would be over.  The crew's
families would not include them in their families, instead they would try to
find their human relatives.  I thought this made perfect sense.  They didn't
say the were less valid than the original crew, they merely recognized that
they couldn't take over the lives of the original crew.  I.E., their copied
identities were already in use by someone else, and they would not be able
to continue with their own identities.
