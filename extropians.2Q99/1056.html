<p>
Black holes are thought to form from stars or other massive objects 
if and when they collapse from their own gravity to form an object 
whose density is infinite: in other words, a singularity. During most 
of a star's lifetime, nuclear fusion in the core generates 
electromagnetic radiation, including photons, the particles of light. 
This radiation exerts an outward pressure that exactly balances the 
inward pull of gravity caused by the star's mass. 

<p>
As the nuclear fuel is exhausted, the outward forces of radiation 
diminish, allowing the gravitation to compress the star inward. The 
contraction of the core causes its temperature to rise and allows 
remaining nuclear material to be used as fuel. The star is saved from 
further collapse -- but only for a while.

<p>
Eventually, all possible nuclear fuel is used up and the core 
collapses. How far it collapses, into what kind of object, and at 
what rate, is determined by the star's final mass and the remaining 
outward pressure that the burnt-up nuclear residue (largely 
iron) can muster. If the star is sufficiently massive or 
compressible, it may collapse to a black hole. If it is less massive 
or made of stiffer material, its fate is different: it may become a 
white dwarf or a neutron star.

Black holes are formed when a star dies.Usually, the star is very 
big, which is at least three times as massive as the sun.All of its 
mass is squeezed into a single point. At this point, both time and 
space stop. It's really hard for us to imagine a place like that, but 
that's how it is in the center of a black hole.

<p>
The center of a black hole is called a singularity. Within a distance 
of the singularity, the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, 
not even light, can escape. That distance is called the event 
horizon. It's like the point of no return.

<p>
When people talk about the size of a black hole, they are referring 
to the size of the event horizon. The more mass the singularity has, 
the larger the event horizon is.

<p>
Many people think that nothing can escape the gravity of a black 
hole. But if this were true, then the whole universe would be sucked 
into the black hole. Stars and planets can circle the black hole if 
they are far enough away from the singularity. Only if things get to 
close to the singularity they cannot escape.

<p>
Black holes are truly black. That makes them extremely hard to 
detect. When black holes collide with other objects including other 
black holes, it will ring with a unique frequency, known as its 
natural mode of vibration. This frequency will tell scientists if 
they have really detected a black hole. It will also tell them how 
big the black hole is and how fast it's spinning.-Chris Morris
