Ted Turner is already married to a beautiful woman and Picasso is 
<pre>
dead.

<a href="0665.html#0669qlink1">&gt;Well, I called all those people and told them that.  Most of them </a><br>
didn't
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink2">&gt;know what I was talking about.  I had to explain what a meme is.  </a><br>
Oprah
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink3">&gt;said  "I'm an entertainer.  I wouldn't be where I am today if I </a><br>
talked
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink4">&gt;about memes.  My career would never have gotten past square one."  </a><br>
Picasso
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink5">&gt;said  "I'm an artist.  I don't give a damn about memes.  I just </a><br>
paint what
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink6">&gt;I see."  Ted Turner did know what a meme was, but he said  "I'm a</a><br>
<i>&gt;businessman, first of all.  I want money, power, fame, and beautiful </i><br>
women.
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink7">&gt; I do have an agenda, of course, and being in my position I can push</a><br>
<i>&gt;certain ideas and not others, but that's not what my career is </i><br>
about.  The
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink8">&gt;idea that somebody would devote his life to propagating memes _as </a><br>
such_ is
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink9">&gt;bizarre.  It reminds me of those cartoons about 'people who don't </a><br>
get the
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink10">&gt;concept.'  Memes can take care of themselves.  Get a life."  </a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Greg continued,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; No one expects to get rich propagating transhuman ideas or </i><br>
extropian
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink11">&gt;values,</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; per se. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, per se is the problem.  If somebody wants to make money, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;rational for him to promote the idea that wealth is a good thing and </i><br>
should
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink12">&gt;not be confiscated for socialistic reasons.  But when someone has no</a><br>
<i>&gt;intention of making money, but tries to propagate the capitalism </i><br>
meme and
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink13">&gt;the rational selfishness meme, per se --  if his main goal is for </a><br>
people to
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink14">&gt;think the right thoughts about these issues -- I just don't know </a><br>
what to
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink15">&gt;make of this.  It reminds me of something C.S. Lewis said, "It is </a><br>
more
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink16">&gt;important that heaven should exist than that I should get there."  I </a><br>
never
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink17">&gt;understood Lewis's statement, and I don't understand the idea of</a><br>
<i>&gt;propagating memes as such, for their own sake.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In today's economy, there are so many opportunities I have to chase </i><br>
them
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink18">&gt;away with a stick.  I'm not saying ExI is useless in its present </a><br>
form, I'm
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink19">&gt;just saying what others have no doubt said many times before -- that </a><br>
there
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink20">&gt;is no reason for it to conceive itself as a propagator of memes, or a</a><br>
<i>&gt;networking group, as opposed to an organization that actually sets </i><br>
forces
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink21">&gt;in motion and makes things happen.  Nevertheless it is what it is, </a><br>
so let's
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink22">&gt;see if there is an alternative.  </a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Lyle: </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; We are entering the age of memetic competition. What kind of meme </i><br>
can
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink23">&gt;&gt; create a phenotype around itself that has the strength to survive </a><br>
and
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink24">&gt;&gt; become immortal? An ism? A corporation? or some new kind of meme? </a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Greg: </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I would answer your question by saying "All of the above." </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; How would you answer it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As everyone knows by now, I go back and forth on the question of </i><br>
whether we
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink25">&gt;even need to think in these terms at all.  The computer industry </a><br>
didn't
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink26">&gt;need a meme to bring it into existence, it just happened, and </a><br>
biotech is
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink27">&gt;happening by itself too.  The technology of immortality will come </a><br>
into
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink28">&gt;existence just like personal computers came into existence, as the </a><br>
natural
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink29">&gt;outcome of economic forces.  Nevertheless, sometimes I do think we </a><br>
need a
<br>
<a href="0665.html#0669qlink30">&gt;meme that can create a phenotype around itself.  This will have to </a><br>
wait
<br>
<i>&gt;till tomorrow.  </i><br>
