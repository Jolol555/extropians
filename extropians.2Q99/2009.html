<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; This may be a weak argument, but to me there seems to be little</i><br>
<i>&gt;  extropian value in enslaving oneself to a gun.  Making a gun one's first</i><br>
<i>&gt;  defense to any threat, imagined or otherwise,  is hardly developing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  yourself as a human.  Non-violence, while less spectacular and seemingly</i><br>
<i>&gt;  slower to get results, is (in my opinion) always to be preferred to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  violent approach. &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I much prefer non-violence. I would bet that everyone on this list prefers </i><br>
<i>&gt; it, also. I would also bet that the maroity of humans prefer it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But the fact at issue here is not non-violence vs. violence (or violence as " </i><br>
<i>&gt; one's first defense to any threat, imagined or otherwise" ), but whether or </i><br>
<i>&gt; not individuals ought to be allowed to own guns.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem with banning guns is, ultimately, that one's life is one's </i><br>
<i>&gt; responsibility to support and defend. Just as one ought to be free to make a </i><br>
<i>&gt; living ( a basically libertarian premise) one also ought to be free to </i><br>
<i>&gt; *protect* that life. And so long as there exists a threat of a forceful </i><br>
<i>&gt; attack on oneself, it is quite prudent to have the means to protect your </i><br>
<i>&gt; life. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="2058qlink1">And both removing guns from the hands of the irresponsible (violent 
criminals, the mentally deficient and/or deranged, children, spouse 
and/or child abusers) and preventing them from arriving there is a 
reasonable, rational and prudent life-protection measure to take.</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1993.html#2009qlink2">&gt; A completely centralized protection agency (like police) is inefficient in </a><br>
<i>&gt; the same way for the same reasons as a completely centralized economic </i><br>
<i>&gt; planner. The problem of information ( Who needs protection? How do I choose </i><br>
<i>&gt; amongst competing claims? ) ultimately makes centralization fail (among other </i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Finally, besides personal responsibility and central inefficiency, I think </i><br>
<i>&gt; that thinking that one can legislate virtue in a populace is incorrect. A </i><br>
<i>&gt; society emerges from a group of people, and a virtuous society emerges from a </i><br>
<i>&gt; group of virtuous citizens. Its a "bottom-up" phenomenon, not a "top-down" </i><br>
<i>&gt; one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Not to indulge in ad populum too much, but the restrictions I have 
advocated would be law if we had a direct vote on them, since the 
majority of voters support them.  Next, although I wasn't the one 
who brought the "people" up, I expect to hear all about the tyranny 
of the majority, while hearing not a peep about the danger of one's 
future being erased by a crazed minority of one.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1993.html#2009qlink3">&gt; Well, I hope I've added something constructive here.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; William</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; PS- What are some good "top-down" phenomena? That is, what are some systems </i><br>
<i>&gt; that work well in a "top-down" way?    </i><br>
