Actually much more recently.

Biosphere II : about halfway between Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona USA.
Built in '90 (?) The two year habitation experiment began in 1991.  Sorry i
dont have a reference for the data/conclusions, but there were major
problems with it.  The project eventually went bankrupt and was bought by
Columbia University which now owns and operates it as a research fdacility.

<i>&gt; Now for ten points...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In a discussion recently the topic came up about an experiment in the US</i><br>
<i>&gt; which involved a sealed mini-ecosystem replete with people, to see if the</i><br>
<i>&gt; closed system was viable, or for how long, or something like that. Was</i><br>
<i>&gt; this</i><br>
<i>&gt; kicked off in the 70s?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously my memory of this thing is quite poor. Does anyone have any</i><br>
<i>&gt; recollection? I can't really look it up on the net, because I can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; remember</i><br>
<i>&gt; what it was called (subject line is my best guess).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (It came up related to living in Canberra, Australia (the nation's</i><br>
<i>&gt; capital!!!). It's the cultural version of the above closed system</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt; in my opinion, and I think the entropy has increased beyond the ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt; sustain a human (intellectual) life).</i><br>
