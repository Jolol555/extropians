Due to the interest and empathy for the Bailey statements, I'll elaborate a
little more. My flight landed just in time for the friday night reception.
We all met at the knowhere store. We were told to retrieve our name tags and
were allowed to mingle for a while. We were then informed of our tasks,
select a few groups to be involved in for each of the following days. These
included topics from MEMEs to biotech, I don't want to divulge to much
information, only because there may be more that evolves out of our meeting.
I was overstimulated, of course that's a good thing. I met some interesting
people there, and heard some solutions thrown out verbally across a room
that were impressive. Some idea's were just worked out into it's realistic
place, even one of mine I realized in conversation wouldn't work. We closed
with some predictions for the future and one person at a time spoke a report
of what had been achieved their group. I was glad to be there.There were
computers and great food all over, the motel was nice too. Merkle was
informative, and entertaining, Drexler, well what can I say, one to never
forget!! Gina "Nanogirl" Miller
