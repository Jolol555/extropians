Well, many people agreed that Batman has a number of
extropian/transhuman qualities, but what about Iron Man?  High
tech armor for every occasion, implants, he was even an upload for a
while.

<p>
Regretably, most trans/posthumans one encounters in comics are likely to
be villains; Galactus is the best example of this.  Also, any character
who actively tries to become more than human is usually the bad (or at
least misguided) guy;  perhaps this is why the heroes origins are
accidents.  The operative meme seems to be "no one who seeks such power
can be trusted with it".

<p>
Anyway, there is one comic book out that deals with the possibilities of
some transhumanist
<br>
 ideas.  It's called Transmetropolitan, written by Warren Ellis,
as part of the DC Vertigo line.  The 
<br>
stories don't always paint a bright picture of this future, but it
certainly is a dynamic one, viewed through the eye of Spider Jerusalem,
a Hunter S Thompson on smart drugs, in his weekly column "I Hate It
Here".  It's also funny as hell, if rife with profanity &amp; political
rants.  I recommend it
<br>
highly.
