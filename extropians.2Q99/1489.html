<p>
Ah seems I will try to be back on the extropian mailing list ;)
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1484.html#1489qlink1">&gt;I'd appreciate extropic comments from anyone interested in enhancing our</a><br>
<i>&gt;senses, and what how this will affect our primal instincts, and, thus,</i><br>
<i>&gt;advance our insight and intra/interpersonal communications, for example.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
A very interesting topic indeed.
<br>
The process of moving to different places has always been somewhat painful
for me.
<br>
I always try not to move too much... next year I will use distant learning
;))
<br>
And there is the old proverb : "the more you move, the less you learn".
(I've probably read that in Centuries by Attanasio ;)
Still we need to upgrade the relationship between our sensory-motor
abilities and what we learn as much as it is possible because it is probably
the most efficient way to do.
<br>
This could seem somewhat childish but i would like to see some kind of
remote sensory capabilities designed like in the game "descent". (a
doom-like but with 3 dimensions of freedom)
I would like to be able to control several descent-like probes (with
multitasking)
<br>
each robotic probes would have the ability to send me the information I
would need to feel in the place... audio and video woud be quite
sufficient... for the begining...
<br>
Such thing would be a major improvment for my learning... i would be able to
watch and interact with pals allowing such probes in their surrounding. So I
would not need to be limited to communicate only with networks users.
There is interesting questions about how to build such probes so that they
are secure in their environment and unable to harm people (using some kind
of GPS?)... how they would fly,..refuel capabilities, noise free, mass
production... ;))
<br>
I wonder how far away it is of the current technology. Of course there would
still exist social problems about such things ;(... a lot of "no probes"
allowed areas and the great majority would probably be quite reluctant to
that...

<p>
More practically, I would like to have the possibility of instantaneous
replay of all the experiences I had (video/audio).
perhaps some little cam on my head and wearable with huge memory storage
would be sufficient.
<br>
I would like, *at least*, to be able to search all my audio/video memories
like I search the web.
<br>
That could be develloped quite easily.


<p>
I'm sure i've not helped you much but remote sensing at distance is
something I would really like to have ;))
<br>
