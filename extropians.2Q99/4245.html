<p>
A dichotomy in my personality is sometimes I am too elusive, speaking in
subtleties or metaphor.  Other times, I am blatantly direct.

<p>
Let me try again:

<p>
If our Ancestral meme-pool is dominated exclusively by male-memes, then our
memes could not be a balanced reproduction of memes and the breeding quite
unrepresentative of ideas.  The meme-pool would not represent transhumanity!  

<p>
Often, there is the toss-in PC meme-breeding of Ayn Rand, but believe me,
she is not representational of all transhuman female-memes!  And she is not
the only female contributor to our memetic history.<a name="4246qlink1"> Can you all not think
of a female that has enlightened you?  Think hard!  Think across
disciplines and get aroused mentally.  Again, there is more to our
ancestral memetic ancestral multi-leveled linage than exclusively focusing
on male-memes.</a>  

<p>
Now, let me make it clear that I am asking that qualifying memes are gender
specific, but out of common courtesy to pay attention to this because it
does affect our mixed-culture.  Role models - both male and female - are
important to us all and psychologically healthy.  We may say that gender
roles are antiquated and that we, as transhumans, needn't focus on what is
inside a person's pants, as long as he or she makes meaningful
contributions.  But it does matter on a deep-rooted level; and perhaps more
than we want to acknowledge because it may appear to make us "human."  I
don't find this a hinderance, but a benefit because unless and until we
deal with these types of issues head on, we will continue to push under the
carpet an aspect of our psychology that does affect us in the deep canyons
of our minds.

<p>
In summation, I am asking that we be congnizant of this and work toward
changing the climate of repeated ignorance and ignoring of women's
contributions to society.
