 ‘Optical Molasses’ Slows Light

Scientists Reduce Speed of Light to a Crawl

B O S T O N,   Feb. 19 — Scientists have managed to slow down light 
so much that if it were a car on a highway, it could get a ticket for 
not getting over to the right-hand lane. 
    
<p>
The speed of light is normally about 186,000 miles per second, or 
fast enough to go around the world seven times in the wink of eye. 
<pre>
     Scientists succeeded in slowing it down to 38 mph. 
     They did this by shooting a laser through extremely cold sodium 
</pre>
atoms, which worked like “optical molasses” to slow the light down. 
<p>
    The experiment doesn’t invent any new physics. When light passes 
through a material such as water or glass, it slows down a bit as the 
photons interact with the surrounding molecules. The new result 
merely set the world record for slowest light. 
Practical Applications 
<br>
While slow-speed light now is just a laboratory plaything for top 
physicists, Lene Vesergaard Hau, the Danish scientist who led the 
project, said practical applications could be a few years away. She 
envisions improved communications technology, switches, even nightvision
 devices. 
<p>
     The atoms were contained in what is called a Bose-Einstein 
condensate, a condition created when matter is cooled almost to 
absolute zero, the lowest temperature theoretically possible. That’s 
459.67 degrees below zero. 
<p>
     “We have really created an optical medium with crazy, bizarre 
properties,” Hau said. “Everybody knows that light is something that 
goes incredibly fast. If you could possibly slow it down to a real 
human dimension. That was really fantastic.” 
<p>
     The research, conducted at the Rowland Institute for Science in 
Cambridge and Harvard University, was described in Thursday’s issue 
of the journal Nature.
