 Sorry to hear all this, but I have a suggestion, which I doubt can be
acted on, but will make it anyways: Since the doctors can do nothing for
your wife go elsewhere for a treatment. Nothing to lose. Suggestion: Since
some foods like tomatoes, green tea, and soybeans have been gaining a
reputation in the scientific community as cancer fighters, then a last
ditch fight using them might be worth trying. Regressions have recently

been obtained in prostate cancer with lycopene pills for example. (tomato
sauce is by far the cheapest source of lycopene) Try a spagetti sauce, soy
tofu diet laced with green tea leaves, IP6, and what else your doctor can
sign off on that might be helpful. Good luck.
