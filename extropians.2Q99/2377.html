<a name="2381qlink1">I'm a little confused as to why it's such a big deal.  I think I'm
probably the least technically savvy person on the entire list, but I
figured out how to kill all the gun messages before I even saw them.  It
took me less than 30 seconds.  (If you're having trouble doing this in
Netscape, write me.)</a>

<p>
<a name="2379qlink1">I wonder if it's a difference in how people approach the list.  To me,
the list is like a party, with different conversations going on in every
room. In one room, brilliant scientists are talking about the ins and
outs of nanotechnology; in another, people are discussing a news article
</a>
about telomere shortening in Dolly, the cloned sheep; and in another
room, people are having a loud, angry debate about gun control.

<p>
The loud, angry gun control debate does seem a little out of place at
this party, but it's easy enough for me to go to the next room.  In real
life, I would avoid people who call each other names in the context of a
debate; here, that is even easier.  &lt;plonk&gt;

<p>
I wonder if the people getting upset see the list more as a conversation
between a small group of friends, and they would feel rude if they don't
listen to what everyone has to say.  Therefore, they find it rude of the
debaters to talk endlessly about something that the others don't want to
discuss.

<p>
Or else they see the list as a formal discussion group, with rules that
are being broken.  If, in real life, you go once a week to a group
discussion on advanced technology, it would be a totally inappropriate
use of that time if people started talking about guns, and against the
rules of the group.

<p>
People with a "party" metaphor can be satisfied with aggresive
killfiling.  Perhaps for people who prefer a formal discussion group,
with chartered rules, we could implement a system of required Meta tags
in the subject header, and all of the guns/property rights/etc postings
could have "CONTROVERSIAL:" in their subject heading, as in,
"CONTROVERSIAL: I still think you are a Communist idiot, and gun
statistics." This would allow the loud people to have their say, without
seriously inconveniencing the rest of us, as it makes killfiling
seamless.

<p>
For people who see the list as a conversation between friends, however,
the only solution I can see is to create a separate list like
"Extropians Meta" and whenever anything gets out of hand, demand that it
be sent over there.

<p>
I do think we may need a formal, procedural solution, as politely asking
people to stop seems to have no effect.
