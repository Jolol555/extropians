Ya he got me on that one too.  Bet that site received several hundred
hits...

Doug, I read the writeups today about RR in Av Week and Aerospace Daily.
I am having a hard time believing Av Weeks contention that the rotary
engine
<br>
was dropped because of investor confidence, yet the helicopter landing
system
<br>
was kept.  That seems like a contradiction to me.  The engine was what gave

<p>
me confidence in RR, not the landing system.  {8-[

<p>
I am still nursing the concept of a two stage to orbit, both stages rotary,

<p>
neither recoverable, where the second stage is parked in a 600 km circular
orbit, so that it can be used later as raw materials to make something
useful.  Ethane and lox, lox tank initially pressurized to about 1.5 to
maybe 2
<br>
atmospheres (absolute), the rest of the chamber operating pressure provided

<p>
by rotation.  The initial tank pressure is to keep the temperature of the
lox
<br>
below the freezing point of ethane, since my concept has the two tanks
nested.  I have convinced myself that the manufacturing costs of a
system could make this concept a go, since you would have no recovery
costs.  Anyone down there working on something like this?  spike
