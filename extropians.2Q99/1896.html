<i>&gt; Frequent Flyer Programs</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Skeptic</i><br>
<i>&gt; Book of the Week: Godel, Escher, Bach</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Frequent Flyer Programs</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you want to see an example of a designer virus that was created for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;simple purpose and got WAY out of control, take a look at frequent flyer</i><br>
<i>&gt;programs. It all started 20 years ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you were going to fly in the US 20 years ago, there were lots of factors</i><br>
<i>&gt;you might take into consideration when deciding which airline to fly, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;basically it was all under the control of a government agency, the Civil</i><br>
<i>&gt;Aeronautics Board (CAB). Airlines had a nice deal back then: they were</i><br>
<i>&gt;pretty much guaranteed profitability. If you wanted to fly from Seattle to</i><br>
<i>&gt;New York, you just picked an airline that flew that route, made a</i><br>
<i>&gt;reservation, and got on the plane. Prices were largely determined by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;CAB, and generally made some sort of sense based on the distance involved.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then came the airline deregulation of the late 70s. The CAB was eliminated,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and where airlines could fly (and what they could charge) was more or less</i><br>
<i>&gt;up to them. With deregulation, not only could competitors start eating into</i><br>
<i>&gt;the most profitable routes, but now just about anybody could start an</i><br>
<i>&gt;airline! Something had to be done to ensure that airlines kept their</i><br>
<i>&gt;profitable business customers and gave them a reason to fly one airline</i><br>
over
<br>
<i>&gt;another.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What happened at American Airlines in 1981 is a legend in the information</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology industry. The CEO of American Airlines, Bob Crandall, was</i><br>
talking
<br>
<i>&gt;to the guy who headed up the Information Technology department, Max Hopper.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It was a typical lunchroom conversation. "How do we get people to fly on us</i><br>
<i>&gt;given that we no longer have this built-in profitability?" Hopper had been</i><br>
<i>&gt;thinking about a way. The idea was that if you flew a certain number of</i><br>
<i>&gt;flights on AA, you'd get a free flight. Because this was designed to give</i><br>
<i>&gt;them an advantage, they called it AAdvantage. Now no great technology was</i><br>
<i>&gt;needed to perform this feat. If you remember back in those days, it was all</i><br>
<i>&gt;done with little pieces of paper that you turned in with your ticket.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Needless to say, AAdvantage was a huge success. Everybody was talking about</i><br>
<i>&gt;it. So United, in about six weeks, responded with Mileage Plus. It was a</i><br>
<i>&gt;similar plan, but with a variation based on the length of the trip: if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;flew a certain number of miles, you got a free ticket. By 1983, it had</i><br>
<i>&gt;started to steamroll. The award schedule went on for pages. They really</i><br>
<i>&gt;didn't know what they were doing. They were in a hurry and didn't put a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt;of thought into it. But accidentally, they put in a lot of good memes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;First of all, they set up the idea of a CHALLENGE. People -- especially the</i><br>
<i>&gt;type of people who fly a lot, high-level businessmen -- love a challenge.</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Hey, I've flown 100,000 miles." "I've flown 200,000!" Just mailing people</i><br>
<i>&gt;the statistics set up the framework for a competition. But that was only</i><br>
the
<br>
<i>&gt;beginning. The thing that really took off was the idea that for cashing a</i><br>
<i>&gt;certain amount of miles -- 10,000 in the beginning -- you could upgrade to</i><br>
<i>&gt;first class. I don't think they really thought that upgrades would be such</i><br>
a
<br>
<i>&gt;big draw, but they started to appeal to the idea of ELITENESS. Coach became</i><br>
<i>&gt;more and more of a cattle car and upgrades gave people a way of getting OUT</i><br>
<i>&gt;of coach.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't know who came up with it first, but the idea of LEVELS in</i><br>
<i>&gt;frequent-flyer programs really appeals to people who have grown up in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Boy Scouts, the Army, or corporate ladders. What do you get when you climb</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ladder? It doesn't really matter. United's 100K-mile level (they call</i><br>
it
<br>
<i>&gt;"1K" for unknown reasons) hardly gives you any benefits over their 50K</i><br>
<i>&gt;level, but want it we do (even me!) As we know from Virus of the Mind,</i><br>
<i>&gt;people love to climb in a status hierarchy. Napoleon said, "A man will</i><br>
<i>&gt;gladly give his life for a shred of cloth and a scrap of metal." How</i><br>
<i>&gt;surprised should we be, then, to find we're willing to connect in Denver in</i><br>
<i>&gt;December for the prospect of a gold-colored plastic card and the lofty</i><br>
title
<br>
<i>&gt;of "Premier Executive," "Platinum Medallion" or "Chairman's Preferred"?</i><br>
It's
<br>
<i>&gt;the modern equivalent of the aristocracy!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As the virus mutated out of control, it became a much bigger part of</i><br>
airline
<br>
<i>&gt;operations than anyone had ever imagined. One thing the airlines weren't</i><br>
<i>&gt;expecting is accruing a whole lot of liability in the form of unredeemed</i><br>
<i>&gt;miles on people's accounts. Enter expiring miles. They pissed off a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;their most loyal customers, and now we're back to non-expiring miles,</i><br>
<i>&gt;especially for the best customers. And you know what? A lot of those people</i><br>
<i>&gt;are never going to redeem their miles. They're just in it for the memes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The people who invented it, at American, now wish it would all go away.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Flights to Hawaii are a third full of unpaying customers. Millions are</i><br>
spent
<br>
<i>&gt;on collateral material. But they are now a slave to the virus they created.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If American stopped offering AAdvantage tomorrow, a million of their best</i><br>
<i>&gt;customers would flee to competitors in a heartbeat. Even Southwest has to</i><br>
<i>&gt;have it! Now when best friends travel together, they argue over which</i><br>
<i>&gt;airline to fly! And through these programs the airlines have also created a</i><br>
<i>&gt;feeling of entitlement. As a Gold member, I like to be treated like gold.</i><br>
<i>&gt;There's nowhere to go but down. In the beginning it was American</i><br>
AAdvantage.
<br>
<i>&gt;Now it's BreAAk Even.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have been a member of United Airlines Mileage Plus for 17 years. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;correspond with other frequent fliers on the FlyerTalk bulletin board and</i><br>
<i>&gt;listen to stories of the lengths people go to feed their mileage addiction.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(One bulletin board contributor even goes by the handle "Mileage Addict.")</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is not at all uncommon for people to make extra connections, fly from</i><br>
<i>&gt;Seattle to London via Washington, D.C., or even take an around-the-world</i><br>
<i>&gt;trip in order to retain their status at the top of the elite ladder. In</i><br>
most
<br>
<i>&gt;of the programs, it takes 100,000 actual flight miles per calendar year to</i><br>
<i>&gt;achieve top status. But when you get there, are the rewards commensurate</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the effort expended and loyalty shown? Or is there only fools gold at</i><br>
<i>&gt;the end of the rainbow?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A little of both. United, the world's biggest airline, has a few perks</i><br>
<i>&gt;reserved for their 100K flyers: special service desks in some airports to</i><br>
<i>&gt;handle canceled flights and missed connections; waiver of that annoying $75</i><br>
<i>&gt;change fee in some cases for domestic flights; and the most important</i><br>
<i>&gt;benefit, first priority on upgrades from the ever-more-sardine-can-like</i><br>
<i>&gt;coach cabin into the tolerable front of the plane. But, really, it's</i><br>
nothing
<br>
<i>&gt;that money can't buy, and you have to begin to wonder how much of a chunk</i><br>
of
<br>
<i>&gt;your life you want to devote to bending over backwards to achieve the</i><br>
<i>&gt;highest levels of these programs. Would you fly 8 hours out of your way for</i><br>
<i>&gt;$200? Would you do it for 10,000 frequent flyer miles? What is your time</i><br>
<i>&gt;worth to you?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The FF programs are one of a class of cultural institutions that have</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolved to give us the illusion of power, status, and security. These are</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiences we all crave to one degree or another, because in evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt;history craving these things led to an improved chance of survival and</i><br>
<i>&gt;reproduction. There is nothing wrong with enjoying these feelings. What is</i><br>
<i>&gt;productive, though, is to ask yourself if this is the most valuable way to</i><br>
<i>&gt;enjoy those feelings. In other words, can you imagine putting the time,</i><br>
<i>&gt;money and energy into some other endeavor that not only gives you a sense</i><br>
of
<br>
<i>&gt;power, status, and security, but also puts you on the path to creating</i><br>
<i>&gt;something of lasting value?</i><br>

<i>&gt;The Skeptic</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;With the publication of the first book on memetics from an academic press,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the field has attracted the notice of people who until now could afford to</i><br>
<i>&gt;dismiss the theory as unworthy of their attention. Now it is beginning to</i><br>
<i>&gt;get the critical attention it deserves. Skepticism is an important part of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the scientific method. It serves to keep theorists honest and searching for</i><br>
<i>&gt;experimental data to prove out their theories.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The cornerstone of modern skepticism is the Skeptics Society, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;publishes an excellent free newsletter. I highly recommend that all Meme</i><br>
<i>&gt;Update subscribers also subscribe to the Skeptic Hotline by sending</i><br>

<i>&gt;Book of the Week</i><br>
<i>&gt;Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</i><br>
<i>&gt;by Douglas Hofstadter</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you haven't read what some people consider the greatest book ever</i><br>
<i>&gt;written, take the opportunity to buy your very own copy of the 20th</i><br>
<i>&gt;anniversary edition of this Pulitzer-prize-winning classic of art, science</i><br>
<i>&gt;and philosophy. It's difficult to imagine anyone reading this masterpiece</i><br>
<i>&gt;and not becoming entranced by the beauty of science, the science of beauty,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Zen of illogic, the logic of Zen, and the mystical threads that weave</i><br>
<i>&gt;together the life of even the most rational of skeptics. This is one of my</i><br>
<i>&gt;favorite books of all time. To quote futurist and boy genius Eliezer</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yudkowsky in his review of GEB: "It is a terrible thing to contemplate that</i><br>
<i>&gt;150,000 people die every day without having read this book. Don't let it</i><br>
<i>&gt;happen to you."</i><br>
