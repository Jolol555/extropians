<a name="3214qlink1">This brings up a point I have always pondered. Any moderately intelligent 
person from OUR CULTURE, would know a gun at night from twenty paces, but a 
Japanese student raised in a totally gunless environment would obvoiusly find 
this behavior so far-</a>fetched ( in fact they have begun training japanese on 
American "Street Smarts"  since they are such sitting ducks in big cities) 
that he would have had a lot of other things he would have assumed that man 
was carrying, but likely not a gun!!

So assumptions play a HUGE role in how we percieve intelligence. 
The saddest part of this cross-up was that neither one of these parties was 
really intending to hurt the other, and both were harmed in a huge and 
irreparable way. Both had cross-cultural assumptions about the other. 
Is  assumptive thinking somehow non-rational?  We cant really live with out 
it, can we? ( see my story below)  But it causes a lot of disruption in 
reality. Are our senses are totally dictated by it? Somewhat?(Man in house 
sees dangerous lunatic, man outside sees (who knows) a man yelling and 
carrying something, maybe a phone...)

<a name="3345qlink2">I know when I called the cops one night when I saw a guy with a gun, they 
interrogated ME!" Ma'am, How do you know it was a gun, how big was it, what 
kind" etc. 
<br>
I only knew because of the WAY he was holding it, and they TYPE of man he 
was.. I never actually really saw it close.. it was night.. I assumed, I 
</a>ran...

<a name="3345qlink3">And, my cultural references wre CORRECT:  they had a stand off outside my pad 
all night long... but if i was rasied on Planet Utopia, I would be dead!
