<p>
Now I regard this as very much to the point, I'm sure that a lot of
people tend to see things that way, even *I* often tend to think</a> of
things as subjective vs objective, as in there's an "inside" of personal
experience and an "outside" of what we can find out about the external
realities of objects, instruments, tools, properties of materials, etc.
What I find extremely likely is the "inside" and the "outside" just
*can't* be fundamentally separate, they have to relate to each other or
be unified in some way. Unless you believe in the old fashioned idea
that you are a "ghost in a machine", the most rational unification would
appear to be that you are a machine, with particular informational or
computational properties that simply stand out as "subjectively real" to
you! The objection that this is only materialism seems moot, as a
generalized materialism is the only thoroughly realistic way of looking
at scientific reality. To accurately describe Nature, the true
materialism would have to include any real energy properties of
space-time, including any little geometric quirks that may be truly real
in Nature. We're talking about the actual shape of reality, here, as
opposed to anyone's idea of ghosts coming in from outside reality, to
trick around with it in some way.

<a name="4452qlink1">Now that the "science can't explain the subjective" thing is out in the
open, I can't help but wonder if this isn't the logical end of the
discussion?<a name="4463qlink1"> If some folks are going to hold that science can't explain
the subjective, then maybe there's no point in coming up with elaborate
schemes to prove</a> that? It seems that any scenario to prove the "failure"
<a name="4463qlink2">of science on this, is itself going to be a kind of science or
engineering or materials scenario, maybe even involving "ghost energy"
of some sort? How can any materialist or realist scenario prove that
realism is missing an essential component?</a>
