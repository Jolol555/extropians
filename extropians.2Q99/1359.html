<p>
<a href="1353.html#1359qlink2">&gt; The fact that people are getting upset over what I am saying when they</a><br>

Trying to rationalize your busybody attitudes will get you no sympathy here. You should realize by now that your 'I'm only doing this for your own good' statist comments are quite offensive to most of us.<a name="1365qlink1"> Its not you forcing your view on anyone that is offensive, but</a> that your view is that people should be forced to change, as well as your view that anyone who doesn't agree to be forced to change is obviously insane and in need of help. You are hopelessly infected by the statist memes that most of us here deplore.

<p>
<a href="1353.html#1359qlink3">&gt; My point is that your response is essentially your choice.  There is no</a><br>
<i>&gt; real reason for anyone to be offended who doesn't want to be in the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; place.  In that case, they should thank me for assisting them in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; emotional experiences they are already seeking in their life, although</i><br>
<i>&gt; they would most likely find someone else to be offended by, if not me.</i><br>

<p>
Again, you're "Oh, innocent me." cop out is a poor rhetorical method.
