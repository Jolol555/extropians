Here's something goofy someone sent me. I hope it doesn't offend anyone,
but with all the flames lately I thought it might be fun for people.

Subject    Amazing Outcome

<p>
Text
<br>
 This is a little game that has an amazing outcome. Don't read
 ahead, just do it in order. It takes about 3 minutes and I think that
 it's worth it. I did it and it was weird! First, get a blank piece of
 paper and pen. When you are asked to choose names, make sure it's people
 you ACTUALLY KNOW. Scroll down one line at a time. Don't read ahead or
 you'll ruin the fun!!


<pre>
                             ARE YOU READY????


</pre>
<p>
 1.) First, write the numbers 1 through 11 in a column.

<p>
 2.) Then, beside numbers 1 and 2, write any two numbers you want.

<p>
 3.) Beside the 3 and 7, write down the names of members of the opposite
<p>
     sex.  Don't look ahead .... or it won't turn out right!

<p>
 4.) Write anyone's name (like friends or family) in the 4th, 5th and 6th
<p>
     spots.


<p>
  **Don't cheat or you'll be upset that you did. This is interesting**


<p>
 5.) Write down four song titles in 8, 9, 10 and 11.

<p>
 6.) Finally, make a wish.....


<hr>


<p>
 1.) You must tell (the number in space 2) people about this game in (the
<p>
     number in space 1) days in order to make your wish come true.

<p>
 2.) The person in space 3 is the one that you love.

<p>
 3.) The person in 7 is one you like but can't work out.

<p>
 4.)  You care most about the person you put in 4.

<p>
 5.)  The person you name in number 5 is the one who knows you very well.

<p>
 6.)  The person you name in 6 is your lucky star

<p>
 7.)  The song in 8 is the song that matches with the person in 3

<p>
 8.)  The title in 9 is the song for the person in 7.

<p>
 9.)  The tenth space is the song that tells you most about your mind.

<p>
 10.) And 11 is the song telling how you feel about life!
