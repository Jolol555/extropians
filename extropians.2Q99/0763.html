<i>&gt; &gt;impact on the survivability of the species.  After all, every aspect of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;both genders is extremely useful under some circumstance.  Having two</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;selection process among the large number of characteristics found across</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;both genders.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure that culture has been around long enough for such adaptations</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have taken hold. The gender differences are largely due (directly and</i><br>
<i>&gt; indirectly) to a differential energy investment in the raising of</i><br>
offspring.

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0755.html#0763qlink3">&gt; Culture is a New Trick whose attributes have emerged from these gender</a><br>
<i>&gt; differences that already existed. (Over evolutionary time, culture may not</i><br>
<i>&gt; turn out to be beneficial for our species at all as we can see from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; various disaster scenarios discussed on the list - it's a gamble, just</i><br>
like
<br>
<a href="0755.html#0763qlink4">&gt; every evolutionary innovation.)</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm all for diversity of personality types, but gender differences per se</i><br>

that
<br>

Agreed.  Although gender psychology is not my field, I think there's
considerable support for the idea that of the 4 gender types:


<OL>
  <li>  undifferentiated
  <li>  masculine
  <li>  feminine
4 androgynous


</OL>
<p>
it's been shown that androgynous individuals tend to be more psychologically
fit in our North American culture at least.  Understand that androgynous
individuals possess the most adaptive traits of both genders.  It would seem
to follow that those attributes which are strictly masculine or feminine and
not part of the androgynous set of attributes become less useful and some
may even become maladaptive as societies advance.

<a name="0766qlink1">Gina, I think you're confusing gender with sexual preference.</a>  I'm not
referring to one's sexual orientation.  I'm referring to your self-concept
in terms of sexual identity.  I once treated a man who wanted a sex change
but fully intended on being a lesbian after the operation.  He was a lesbian
trapped in a man's body!  I started thinking...hmmm, how do I know _I'm_ not
a lesbian trapped in a man's body?   I mean, _I_ like women!  The
difference, of course, was that he felt like a woman inside, not a man.
