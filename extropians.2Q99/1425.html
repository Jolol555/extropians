If you look back over what I've written on this thread, you may notice the
fact that my comments address claims *you* have endorsed.  Since you have
yet to offer a substantive response to anything I've said, I must assume
that either you can't support them or you aren't interested in discussing
them.  Either way, it appears that there is no point in pursuing the topic.

<p>
So far as the book is concerned, your comments make it sound like yet
another "we have to sacrifice everything to save the planet or we'll all
die" tract, with a health dose of luddite technophobia thrown in for good
measure.  Of course I wouldn't waste time reading something like that - I've
got a 3-foot stack of productive reading I'm working through right now, and
that's as small as my to-read list is likely to get in the next decade.

<a name="1429qlink1">The review you quote paints a very different picture.  While not one of the
ideas mentioned therein is actually new, the idea of combining them into a
coherent whole has enough promise to be worth looking into.  Anyone who
addresses that many topics in one book probably has something interesting to
say about something.</a>

<p>
<a name="1429qlink2">So, which picture is correct?  Is _Concilience_ a scholarly work devoted to
the time-honored goal of connecting all of human knowledge into a coherent
whole?  Or is it another environmental doomsday scenario?</a>
