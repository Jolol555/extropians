There is no particular limit to how big an object can be moved with current
technology.  Once you get bigger than a few hundred tons you'll want to
build custom equipment for the job, but that's mostly a matter of
convenience - its more efficient than setting up large teams of comercial
bulldozers &amp; such.  You can scale up to tens of thousands of tons before
things even start to get tricky, which is far larger than anything that the
ancients ever moved.

<p>
<a name="1210qlink2">It might be usefull to point out here that we usually think in terms of
moving something a few thousand miles in a matter of days or weeks.  The
ancients, OTOH, were usually moving things a few dozen miles over the course
of months or years.  If you think like the ancients, those amazing feats
suddenly start seeming a lot more doable.</a>

<p>
Again, we're pretty sure we know how they did it.  You just need a good
knowledge of naked-eye astronomy, and lots of patience and attention</a> to
detail.

<p>
<a name="1210qlink4">BTW - Surely you realize that in the modern world we can align a building to
essentially infinite precision?  (i.e. our instruments permit such high
precision that the thermal flexing of the building &amp; ground will produce
much larger errors than an imprecision of our measurements)

Never heard of them.  Do you have a link?</a>
