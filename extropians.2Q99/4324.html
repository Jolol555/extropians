Lincoln may have been dedicated to doing the moral thing but that does not
mean that what he did was something that I would endorse.  On the contrary
I have deep misgivings about Lincoln.  Under Lincoln the US suffered from the
military draft, income taxes and the ever increasing size of the federal 
government.  Further he refused to let the Confederacy leave the Union thus 
leading a very nasty war and the reason was not to free slaves but to preserve
the Union.</a> 

<p>
<a name="4395qlink2">Read for example The Emancipation Proclamation; it did not free all of the 
slaves, it only applied to those slaves in areas which were in rebellion
against
<br>
the USA.  According to the document the reason it was issued was as 
"a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion".</a>
