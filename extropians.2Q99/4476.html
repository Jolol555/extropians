I'm just jealous cos I got "Butt Monkey"

<a href="4446.html#4476qlink1">&gt; Actually they are all intelligent (does this include the General) and cool</a><br>
<i>&gt; sounding. It's set up like horoscopes, to stroke your ego. No one is going</i><br>
<i>&gt; to create a test that comes out as follows:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ---</i><br>
<i>&gt; Your test has been evaluated, and you have been found to most resemble -</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Dispossessed - In space, no one can here you fail</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The future is a difficult, shifting terrain, full of traps for the unwary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; As a fully paid-up lifetime member of the unwary, you have fallen foul of</i><br>
<i>&gt; many such traps, and find yourself living a life of bare subsistence,</i><br>
<i>&gt; hitching from crappy space station to crummy satelite, trying to steal</i><br>
<i>&gt; scraps before they end up in the matter recycler. Even the rats push you</i><br>
<i>&gt; around. A true loser, you would be a universally tragic figure, except</i><br>
<i>&gt; that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you lack the personal stature to invoke such noble emotion. Perhaps the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you hang on at all is in some way redemptive, but in the end no one</i><br>
<i>&gt; really could really bring themselves to care. Maybe you should consider</i><br>
<i>&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact that you are breathing other people's oxygen.</i><br>
