Measuring The Cosmic Neutrino Background

<p>
The cosmic neutrino background can, in principle, be detected, according to 
the American Institute of Physics' Physics News Update for April 27. There 
are, the Bulletin points out, almost as many neutrinos loose in the universe 
as photons, and almost as much energy vested in neutrinos as in photons.
But because neutrinos are extremely reticent about interacting with other 
particles, detecting the neutrino background is not as easy as detecting the 
cosmic photon (microwave) background. That's why dedicated neutrino 
detectors struggle just to record a handful of incoming neutrinos from 
potent nearby sources such as the sun.

<p>
Nevertheless, the Bulletin says, there might be a chance to map the 
background indirectly: The pattern of lumps in the microwave background, 
which will be measured by the upcoming MAP and PLANCK orbiting detectors, in 
fact encodes information about the neutrino background.

<p>
(The PLANCK mission is a European Space Agency project to image the 
temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The 
whole sky will be mapped in nine frequency channels ranging between 30 and 
900 GHz, with a sensitivity and an angular resolution that will allow the 
separation of the cosmological signal from all other sources of confusion.)

<p>
Scott Dodelson of Fermilab, Michael Turner and Robert Lopez of the 
University of Chicago and Andrew Heckler of Ohio State, in an upcoming 
article in Physical Review Letters, show that these measurements will 
accurately establish the time at which slow-moving matter (protons and later 
atoms) became predominant over fast-moving radiation (photons and 
neutrinos). In turn, they write, this determines precisely how much early 
annihilation energy (arising from electrons and positrons smashing up) was 
apportioned among photons and neutrinos.
