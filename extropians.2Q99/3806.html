  The promoting effects of geniposidic acid and aucubin in
  Eucommia ulmoides Oliver leaves on collagen synthesis.

Abstract
<br>
  We have reported that collagen synthesis was stimulated by the administration
  of a hot water extract from the leaves of Eucommia ulmoides
  OLIVER, Eucommiaceae (Du-Zhong leaves) in false aged model
  rats. In this paper, we set out to examine the compounds in Du-Zhong leaves
  that stimulated collagen synthesis in false aged model rats. In experiment 1,
  a methanol extract of Du-Zhong leaves also stimulated collagen synthesis in
  aged model rats. An acetone fraction was derived from the methanol extract by
  silica gel chromatography in experiment 2. The acetone fraction mainly
  contained iridoides mono-glycosides such as geniposidic acid and aucubin. The
  administration of geniposidic acid or aucubin stimulated collagen synthesis
  in aged model rats in experiments 3 and 4 (significance (p&lt;0.05)). The
  reported pharmacological effects of Du-Zhong leaves, including healing organs
  and strengthening bone and muscle, are closely related to collagen
  metabolism. It appears that geniposidic acid and aucubin are the actual
  compounds in Du-Zhong which caused the effect in our experiments.

Abstract
<br>
  Stimulation of collagen synthesis prevents the aging process. We found such a
  synergistic effect by using the leaves of Eucommia ulmoides
  Oliver, Eucomiaceae (Du-Zhong leaf) and the roots of Panax ginseng C. A.
  MEYER (Ginseng). The formula consists of amounts which exert no effect when
  used individually. We tested several formula ratios of Ginseng and Du-Zhong
  leaf, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4, and concluded that the last two formulas were
  effective. However, we did not observe a significant difference between 1:3
  and 1:4. Thus, it was demonstrated that the formula ratio of Ginseng to
  Du-Zhong leaf of 1:3 was the most effective for the stimulation of collagen
  synthesis and the prevention of decreased protein metabolism in aging.

Title
  Antimutagenicity of Tochu tea (an aqueous extract of
  Eucommia ulmoides leaves): 1. The clastogen-suppressing
  effects of Tochu tea in CHO cells and mice.

Abstract
  The suppressing effect of crude extracts of Tochu tea, an aqueous extract of
  Eucommia ulmoides leaves and a popular beverage in Japan, on
  the induction of chromosome aberrations in CHO cells and mice was studied.
  When CHO cells were treated with Tochu tea crude extract after MMC treatment,
  the frequency of chromosome aberrations was reduced. Out of 17 Tochu tea
  components, 5 irridoids (geniposidic acid, geniposide, asperulosidic acid,
  deacetyl asperulosidic acid, and asperuloside) and 3 phenols (pyrogallol,
  protocatechuic acid, and p-trans-coumaric acid) were found to have
  anticlastogenic activity. Since the anticlastogenic irridoids had an
  alpha-unsaturated carbonyl group, this structure was considered to play an
  important role in the anticlastogenicity. The anticlastogenic effect of Tochu
  tea extracts was examined in mice using a micronucleus assay. When mice
  received 1.0 ml 4% Tochu tea extract by oral gavage 6 h before
  intraperitoneal injection of MMC, a decrease in the frequency of micronuclei
  was observed. This decrease was not due to a delay in the maturation of
  micronucleated reticulocytes.
