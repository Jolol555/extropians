<i>&gt; Part of the answer appears to be, "it depends." A _sufficiently_ armed</i><br>

<p>
While many make at least a half hearted attempt to be prepared, most are
insufficiently prepared, and are relying on their own self delusion.

<p>

<a href="0036.html#0040qlink3">&gt; Another part of the answer appears to be "--Barrier? I see no barrier!" A</a><br>
<i>&gt; deterrent is only a deterrent if it's credible--_vide_ Dr. Strangelove's</i><br>

<i>&gt; certain amount of imperfect information.</i><br>

<p>
Depends on the intensity of the level of conflict. I have recently come the the
conclusion that somewhere between 20%-40% of all firearms privately owned in the
US are usable as infantry weapons. Most of the rest are for personal defense
use. Only 10 percent are exclusively usable for hunting. 60% of households own
at least one firearm here, compared to less than 5-10% in large cities. The
disparity in the crime stats I think is indicative of the deterrent effect.

Ha, yeah. I'm stocking up for my End o' the World Party at my camp in January.
Bunks are available...
