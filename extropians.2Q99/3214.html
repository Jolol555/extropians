Japanese culture isn't totally gun-free; the crooks have plenty of guns
but don't need to use them because they've traditionally been able to do 
much better by simply extorting money from Japanese business... that's now
changing as the economy worsens. Not to mention the extremely violent 
Japanese media, where guns are common.

<a name="3344qlink1">And again, you're being 'careless and frivolous about facts'. He wasn't 
shot from twenty paces, and if he had been I'd certainly have supported 
a murder conviction. The home owner was holding a .44 magnum revolver -- 
which, if you've never shot one, is a *very* big gun -- and shot him from 
a few feet away. You can't seriously claim that he didn't know the guy</a> had 
a gun.

the traditional way, beheading the others with a sword.
