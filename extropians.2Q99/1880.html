<i>&gt; N. Katherine Hayles. _How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt; In the late 20th century with the millennium upon us, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinction between human beings and machines is blurred. Popular</i><br>
<i>&gt; culture seems to confirm Jean Baudrillard's contention that it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; no longer necessary to write science-fiction since we now live it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Consistent with this assertion is the widespread belief that we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the verge of the "post-body," "post-biological," or</i><br>
<i>&gt; "post-human." This view has been a subject of analysis both for</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychologist Sherry Turkle and science historian J. David Bolter</i><br>
<i>&gt; who refers to the late-20th-century human as "Turing's Man."</i><br>
<i>&gt; Theorists such as Arthur and Marilouise Kroker argue that the body</i><br>
<i>&gt; is already obsolete.<a name="1947qlink2"> According to the Krokers, bodies have become</i><br>
<i>&gt; expendable in the late 20th century as the economy collapses and</i><br>
<i>&gt; culture implodes. In practice, the concept of obsolescence as</i><br>
<i>&gt; applied to humans is a form of social Darwinism: it posits the</i><br>
<i>&gt; survival of those with the economic means to finance their</i><br>
<i>&gt; continued existence.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="1947qlink3"><i>&gt; In her most recent book, _How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics_, Katherine Hayles</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not offer certainties or conclusions;<a name="1947qlink4"> she presents questions</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt; and suggestions fashioned in a looping manner that flow from</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept to artefact with parataxis at the heart of her argument.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Her account is frequently gnomic and tantalising, both suggestive</i><br>
<i>&gt; and enlightening;</a> she raises issues of great importance, both</i><br>
<a name="1947qlink5"><i>&gt; from a philosophical and political standpoint, in today's</i><br>
<i>&gt; informatic age.</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The chapters are structured like a seriation chart to which she</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes reference in relation to the history of cybernetics from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Macy Conferences in the 1950s to the present. In the history</i><br>
<i>&gt; of cybernetics, ideas were rarely made up out of a whole</i><br>
<i>&gt; cloth. Rather, they are fabricated in a pattern of</i><br>
<i>&gt; overlapping replication and innovation, a pattern that Hayles</i><br>
<i>&gt; calls "seriation" (a term appropriated from archaeological</i><br>
<i>&gt; anthropology). The three main movements or "waves" of cybernetics</i><br>
<i>&gt; are homeostasis (1945-1960), reflexivity (1960-1985) and virtuality</i><br>
<i>&gt; (1985 to the present). Within archaeological anthropology, changes</i><br>
<i>&gt; in artefacts are customarily mapped through seriation charts. One</i><br>
<i>&gt; constructs a seriation chart by parsing an artefact as a set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; attributes that change over time. Hayles uses the example of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "lamps." A key attribute of lamps is the element that gives off</i><br>
<i>&gt; light. The first lamps, dating back thousands of years, used</i><br>
<i>&gt; wicks for this purpose. Later, with the discovery of electricity,</i><br>
<i>&gt; wicks gave way to filaments. Considered as a set, the figures</i><br>
<i>&gt; depicting changes in the attributes of an artefact reveal patterns</i><br>
<i>&gt; of overlapping innovation and replication. Some attributes change</i><br>
<i>&gt; from one model to the next, while others remain the same.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The conceptual shifts that took place during the development of</i><br>
<i>&gt; cybernetics display a seriated pattern reminiscent of material</i><br>
<i>&gt; changes in artefacts. Conceptual fields evolve similarly to material</i><br>
<i>&gt; culture in part because concept and artefact engage each other in</i><br>
<i>&gt; continuous feedback loops. An artefact materially expresses the</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept it embodies, but the process of its construction is far from</i><br>
<i>&gt; passive.<a name="1947qlink6"> A glitch has to be fixed, a material exhibits unexpected</i><br>
<i>&gt; properties, an emergent behaviour surfaces-any of these challenges</i><br>
<i>&gt; can give rise to a new concept, which results in another generation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of artefacts, which leads to the development of still other</i><br>
<i>&gt; concepts.</a> According to this rationale, one should be able to trace</i><br>
<i>&gt; the development of a conceptual field by using a seriation chart</i><br>
<i>&gt; analogous to those used for artefacts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hayles makes her intentions clear as of the first chapter. Her book</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not just a historical examination of the cybernetic episteme: it</i><br>
<i>&gt; explores the complex interplays between embodied forms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; subjectivity and arguments for disembodiment throughout the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cybernetic tradition.<a name="1947qlink7"> She asks a number of fundamental questions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; How has information lost its body? How did it come to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; conceptualised as an entity separate from the material forms in</i><br>
<i>&gt; which it is thought to be embedded?</a> How did the cyborg emerge as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological artefact and cultural icon in the years following</i><br>
<i>&gt; World War II? How is a historically specific construct, the human,</i><br>
<i>&gt; giving way to a different construct, the posthuman?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Central to the construction of the cyborg are informational pathways</i><br>
<i>&gt; connecting the organic body to its prosthetic extensions. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; presumes a conception of information as a disembodied entity that</i><br>
<i>&gt; can flow between carbon-based organic components and silicon-based</i><br>
<i>&gt; electronic components to make protein and silicon operate in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; single system. When information loses its body, equating humans and</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers is easy, for the materiality in which the thinking mind is</i><br>
<i>&gt; instantiated appears incidental to its essential nature. The idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the feedback loop implies that the boundaries of the autonomous</i><br>
<i>&gt; subject are up for grabs, since feedback loops can flow not only</i><br>
<i>&gt; within the subject but also between the subject and the environment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; From Norbert Wiener on, the flow of information through feedback</i><br>
<i>&gt; loops has been associated with the deconstruction of the liberal</i><br>
<i>&gt; humanist subject, the version of the "human" with which the</i><br>
<i>&gt; posthuman  is concerned.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="1947qlink8"><i>&gt; As its premise, Hayles's work contests the materiality/information</i><br>
<i>&gt; separation by complicating the leap from embodied reality to</i><br>
<i>&gt; abstract information. She accomplishes this by pointing to moments</i><br>
<i>&gt; when the assumption involved in this move was contested by other</i><br>
<i>&gt; researchers in the field.<a name="1947qlink9"> The point of highlighting such moments is</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt; to make clear how much had to be erased to arrive at such</i><br>
<i>&gt; abstractions as bodiless information. Of course, abstraction is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; essential component in theorizing, for no theory can account for the</i><br>
<a name="1947qlink10"><i>&gt; infinite multiplicity of our interactions with the real.</a> But when we</i><br>
<i>&gt; make moves that erase the world's multiplicity, we risk losing sight</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the variegated leaves, fractal branchings and particular bark</i><br>
<i>&gt; textures that make up the forest.</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="1947qlink11"><i>&gt; In the posthuman, we encounter a host of fictional speculations</i><br>
<i>&gt; (from Bernard Wolfe's _Limbo_ to the novels of Philip K. Dick) and</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt; theoretical hypotheses about the total transformation of the human</i><br>
<i>&gt; body that occurs through its interpolation in the nascent information</i><br>
<i>&gt; networks. Contiguous with these claims, we find another set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; observations on the entrenchment of existing bodily stereotypes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the electronic media. At successive moments in their development,</i><br>
<i>&gt; digital media have contributed to the destabilization of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; established sense of "reality." But, at the same time, these new</i><br>
<i>&gt; media are used to simulate signifying objects, the bodies and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; worlds they are rendering obsolete.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; One of the main areas examined in the posthuman from the perspective</i><br>
<i>&gt; of dematerialization is the epistemic shift toward pattern/</i><br>
<i>&gt; randomness from presence/absence. This shift affects human and</i><br>
<i>&gt; textual bodies on two levels at once, as a change in the body (the</i><br>
<i>&gt; material substrate) and as a change in the message (the codes of</i><br>
<i>&gt; representation). The connectivity between these changes can be seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Hayles's examination of contemporary fiction and information</i><br>
<i>&gt; technologies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But what happens to the experience of embodiment, which Hayles</i><br>
<i>&gt; refers to as a "blind spot" in literary studies? The blind spot she</i><br>
<i>&gt; refers to is most evident when literary and cultural critics</i><br>
<i>&gt; confront the fields of evolutionary biology. "From an evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; biologist's point of view, humans with all their technological</i><br>
<i>&gt; prowess, represent an eye blink in the history of life, a species</i><br>
<i>&gt; far too recent to have significant evolutionary impact on human</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological behaviours and structures" (284). This question defines</i><br>
<i>&gt; what is at stake culturally in the development of these new</i><br>
<i>&gt; technologies. Both contemporary theory and popular culture attempt</i><br>
<i>&gt; to narrativise this mutation in the relation between mind and body,</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps most visible in cyborg imagery, as feminist and cultural</i><br>
<i>&gt; theorist Donna Haraway has argued in "A Cyborg Manifesto."</i><br>
<i>&gt; AI researcher Hans Moravec has envisioned a way to make the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cartesian metaphor of the mind divorced from the  body a literal</i><br>
<i>&gt; reality by taking the human mind out of the brain in what he calls</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "postbiological." He describes how it will someday be possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; for human mental functions to be surgically extracted from the human</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain and transferred to computer software through a process he</i><br>
<i>&gt; calls "transmigration." The useless human body and its brain tissue</i><br>
<i>&gt; would then be discarded, while human consciousness would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; downloaded in computer terminals, or for the occasional outing, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; mobile robots. In his most recent book  _Robot: Mere Machine to</i><br>
<i>&gt; Transcendent Mind_ (Oxford Press, 1998), he discusses the prospects</i><br>
<i>&gt; of machine intelligence overtaking human intelligence in less than</i><br>
<i>&gt; 50 years.<a name="1947qlink12"> Despite the extreme nature of his ideas, Moravec is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; isolated mad scientist: his vision of separating mind from body has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been endorsed by Marvin Minsky, the MIT professor of Science and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Technology. Minsky's integration of human intellect and emotions</i><br>
<i>&gt; evokes theories of holistic medicine. His writings, however, do</i><br>
<i>&gt; not argue for the preservation of human life; they contemplate</i><br>
<i>&gt; its extinction.</a> According to this view, the mind takes over</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualities associated with the body, presumably making the latter</i><br>
<i>&gt; obsolete.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="1947qlink13"><i>&gt; Hayles tells of another story about the collapse of the mind-body</i><br>
<i>&gt; dualism and its outcomes: what disappears are not material bodies</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt; but an abstract notion of the body as the naturalising ground of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; unitary and universalising notion of the self. The disappearance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "the body" is then followed by a reconstruction or reconfiguration</i><br>
<i>&gt; of embodiment, and only the alternative models of historical</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience generated by that reconstruction deserve the name of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "posthuman."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The narrative structure of _How We Became Posthuman_ is also</i><br>
<i>&gt; revealing. Hayles has selected literary texts-stories that focus</i><br>
<i>&gt; on scientific theories-that merit wider currency in the body</i><br>
<i>&gt; politic. As the chapters on scientific developments demonstrate,</i><br>
<i>&gt; culture circulates through science as readily as science</i><br>
<i>&gt; circulates through culture.  The heart that keeps this circulatory</i><br>
<i>&gt; system flowing is narrative - narratives about culture, narratives</i><br>
<i>&gt; within culture, narratives about science, narratives within</i><br>
<i>&gt; science. In her account of scientific developments, Hayles has</i><br>
<i>&gt; sought to emphasise the role that narrative plays in articulating</i><br>
<i>&gt; the posthuman as a technical-cultural concept. She has done so by</i><br>
<i>&gt; looking, for example, at artificial intelligence as a narrative</i><br>
<i>&gt; field (in chapter 9).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The concept of virtual bodies and narrative is examined in the light</i><br>
<i>&gt; of narrative itself, particularly its resistance to various forms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; abstraction and disembodiment. By turning the technological</i><br>
<i>&gt; determinism of bodiless information, the cyborg and the posthuman</i><br>
<i>&gt; into narratives about the negotiations that take place between</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular people at particular times and places, Hayles replaces a</i><br>
<i>&gt; teleology of disembodiment with historically contingent stories</i><br>
<i>&gt; about contests between competing factions, contests whose outcomes</i><br>
<i>&gt; were far from obvious. Many factors affected the outcomes, from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; needs of emerging technologies for reliable quantification to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; personalities of the people involved. Though overdetermined, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; disembodiment of information isn't inevitable, anymore than it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; inevitable that we continue to accept the idea that we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; essentially informational  patterns.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In this regard, the literary texts that Hayles has selected do more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than explore the cultural implications of scientific theories and</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological artefacts. Embedding ideas and artefacts in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; situated specificities of narrative, the literary texts give these</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas and artefacts a local habitation and a name through</i><br>
<i>&gt; discursive formulations whose effects are specific to that textual</i><br>
<i>&gt; body. In exploring these effects, Hayles wants to demonstrate, on</i><br>
<i>&gt; multiple levels and in many ways, that abstract patterns can never</i><br>
<i>&gt; fully capture the embodied actuality, unless they are as prolix</i><br>
<i>&gt; and noisy as the body itself. Shifting the emphasis from</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological determinism to competing, contingent, embodied</i><br>
<i>&gt; narratives about scientific developments is one way to liberate the</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources of narrative so that they work against the grain of</i><br>
<i>&gt; abstraction that runs through the teleology of disembodiment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Another way is to read literary texts alongside scientific theories.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In articulating the connections that run through these two</i><br>
<i>&gt; discursive realms, Hayles wants to entangle abstract form and</i><br>
<i>&gt; material particularity such that the readers will find it</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasingly difficult to maintain the perception that they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; separate and discrete entities. In this book, literary texts with</i><br>
<i>&gt; their fashionings of embodied particularities are crucial.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What then is the posthuman? The posthuman view, according to Hayles,</i><br>
<i>&gt; is suggestive rather than prescriptive. It privileges informational</i><br>
<i>&gt; pattern over material instantiation, so that embodiment in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological substrate is seen as an accident of history rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; an inevitability of life. The posthuman view considers consciousness,</i><br>
<i>&gt; regarded as the seat of human identity in the Western tradition long</i><br>
<i>&gt; before Descartes, as an epiphenomenon, an evolutionary upstart trying</i><br>
<i>&gt; to claim that it is the whole show when in fact it is only a minor</i><br>
<i>&gt; side-show. The posthuman view regards the body as the original</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosthesis we all learn to manipulate, so that extending or replacing</i><br>
<i>&gt; the body with other prostheses becomes a continuation of a process</i><br>
<i>&gt; that began before we were born. Above all, Hayles claims that by</i><br>
<i>&gt; these and other means, the posthuman view configures human beings</i><br>
<i>&gt; so that they can be seamlessly articulated with intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt; machines. In the posthuman, there are no essential differences or</i><br>
<i>&gt; absolute demarcations between bodily existence and computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; simulation, cybernetic mechanism and biological organism, robot</i><br>
<i>&gt; teleology and human goals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In tracing the dis/continuities between a "natural" self and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cybernetic posthuman, Hayles is not trying to recuperate the liberal</i><br>
<i>&gt; subject. Rather, she views the present moment as a critical juncture</i><br>
<i>&gt; when interventions might be made to keep disembodiment from being</i><br>
<i>&gt; rewritten, once again, into prevailing concepts of subjectivity. She</i><br>
<a name="1947qlink15"><a name="1947qlink14"><i>&gt; sees the deconstruction</a> of the liberal humanist subject as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity to put back into the picture the flesh that continues to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be erased in contemporary discussions about cybernetic subjects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hence her focus on how information lost its body, for this story is</i><br>
<i>&gt; central to creating what Arthur and Marilouise Kroker have called the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "flesh-eating 90s."</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The stories told in _How We Became Posthuman_ - how information</i><br>
<i>&gt; lost its body, how the cyborg was created as a cultural icon and</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological artefact, and how humans have become posthuman -</i><br>
<i>&gt; would not have the same resonance or breadth if they had been</i><br>
<i>&gt; pursued through literary texts or scientific discourses alone. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientific texts reveal, as literature cannot, the foundational</i><br>
<i>&gt; assumptions that gave theoretical scope and artefactual efficacy to</i><br>
<i>&gt; a particular approach. The literary texts reveal, as scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; works cannot, the complex cultural, social, and representational</i><br>
<i>&gt; issues tied up with conceptual shifts and technological</i><br>
<i>&gt; innovations. By fusing the two, Hayles offers a way of</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding ourselves as embodied creatures living in embodied</i><br>
<i>&gt; and disembodied words.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="1947qlink16"><i>&gt; Hayles sums up the posthuman as follows: "If my nightmare is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; culture inhabited by posthumans who regard their bodies as fashion</i><br>
<i>&gt; accessories rather than the ground of being,<a name="1947qlink17"> my dream is a version</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt; of the posthuman that embraces the possibilities of information</i><br>
<i>&gt; technologies without being seduced by fantasies of unlimited power</i><br>
<i>&gt; and disembodied immortality,</a> that recognizes and celebrates finitude</i><br>
<a name="1947qlink18"><i>&gt; as a condition of human being,</a> and that understands human life is</i><br>
<a name="1947qlink19"><i>&gt; embedded in a material world of great complexity, one on which we</i><br>
<i>&gt; depend for our continued survival."</i><br>
