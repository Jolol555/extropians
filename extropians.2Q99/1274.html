ORANGES THAT BROADCAST
<br>
How could we live today without those ubiquitous bar codes on everything 
from soup cans to traffic tickets! Now, some work being done by Motorola 
could put those trusty bar codes in the history books. A new kind of 
microchip being developed combines enough memory to store 110 characters 
with a radio antenna - all the size of a single coffee ground.  This very 
microchip can be stuck or manufactured to just about anything. Besides more 
room for the product name, price, coupons, and so on - the chip can use its 
built-in antenna to transmit this information about of the product it's 
stuck to. That means no more waiting in line to check out at the grocery 
store - you'd just walk through the checkout station and a radio receiver 
would tally up what's in your cart. And since you can store data in the chip 
too, imagine an amusement park ticket that gets updated each time you go on 
a ride - and you just pay the total on the way out.

<p>
The first product to have a UPC bar code on its packaging was Wrigley's gum.

BIONIC EYES
<br>
Your eye doctor might be offering more than contacts in the future - you 
might be ordering a bionic eye soon.  Now don't worry, the idea that cyborgs 
will be wandering around is a ways off yet - but that far.  Up 'til now, the 
technology wasn't there, and neither was the neuroscience. But now most of 
the research is complete and it's moving quickly into corporate R&amp;D. The 
human body is basically a large electric machine- one that researchers say 
they may be able to repair with electronic hardware. In some cases, they 
already can: The first device to restore a human sense, the ear implant, has 
been combatting deafness since the 70s. Today, more than 25,000 people have 
these bionic ears. And the eye is next. Two startup companies - one in 
Illinois and the other in Germany - have already formed to commercialize 
artificial retina designs.

<p>
It is impossible to sneeze and keep ones eye's open at the same time.

LETTING YOUR BRAIN'S GUARD DOWN
<br>
It's got a simple name - P97 - but to researchers at one Vancouver Canada 
biotech firm, this special blood protein could change the way we use drugs 
in the future. The brain has a very selective barrier protecting it, and 
only molecules that are actively transported across this barrier can enter 
the brain. Needless to say, with the barrier turning away most molecules at 
the door, this makes the delivery of drugs from blood to brain quite a 
challenge. But Synapse Technologies (<a href="http://www.synapse-tech.com">http://www.synapse-tech.com</a>) believes 
its research might hold a key.  From its labs on the UBC campus, it's been 
working on P97 to train it to deliver drugs across that protective brain 
barrier with more success. Down the road, it could spell the end to 
overdosing the body with toxic drugs just to get a bit to the brain, 
something cancer patients and other seriously ill people have to cope with.

<p>
The average brain comprises 2 percent of a person's total body weight. yet 
it requires 25 percent of all oxygen used by the body, as opposed to 12 
percent used by the kidneys and 7 percent by the heart.

RUBBER STAMP COMPUTER MAKING
<br>
Those fun rubber stamp stores for kids might soon have junion building their 
own microchips, thanks to a technology quietly in development at Lucent.  
It's working on a way to use silicone rubber stamps to print computer 
circuits on flexible plastics, curved surfaces, and, some day, even special 
clothing fibres.  The technique uses a rubber stamp (made of the same 
silicon gel today's rubber stamps use) to essentially "print" the circuit 
pattern on whatever surface is being used as the base.  {PC Week}

<p>
Rubber is one of the ingredients of bubble gum. It is the substance that 
allows the chewer to blow a bubble.

<p>
AIRCAR TAKES THE ROAD
<br>
Think the car of the future is electrical?  How about if the car were to use 
nothing but AIR to propel itself.  One French company has developed just 
such a car.  The company is led by an expert in making engines for 
lightweight aircraft and Formula One racing cars.  To power the pistons, the 
two-cylinder motor uses headed outside air and super-compressed air from 
tanks stored under the car.  The Mexican government has 40,000 cars on order 
to build a taxi fleet.  It takes about three minutes to "fill up" at a tire 
pump and you can get about 120 miles to the tankful.  They'll be released 
next year with a price tag of $13,000.  {Wired Magazine, May 1999}

<p>
TODBIT: Cars produce about four times their own weight in carbon dioxide 
each year. The average home produces 50 tons of carbon dioxide each year.

MAX SMART, STEP OFF!
<br>
Your next shoe might have a microchip in the heel.  A smart shoe prototype 
has been developed by MIT that automatically senses the wearer's cushioning 
needs by adjusting fluid in five bladders in the sole.  A microchip in the 
heel monitors pressure on the bladders, adjusting pressure on the fly -- 
more cushioning for running, less for walking.

<p>
Did you ever wonder what the WD in WD-40 stands for? WD is an abbreviation 
for Water Displacer 40th attempt.

INTERNET IN YOUR KITCHEN
<br>
In my kitchen, I've got one of those under-the-cabinet SpaceMaker toasters 
but I've always thought that would be a great place to have a flip-down TV.  
Well now, for only $2200 (ouch) I can.  CMI Worldwide of Seattle have come 
out with a flipdown flat panel screen that is a TV and a full Internet 
kiosk.  You can either watch broadcast TV through a cable port in the back, 
or hook up a security camera to watch your kids in the back yard.  All while 
making nachos.

TOMORROW'S PARKING METER TO STOP SCAMMING
You won't be getting away with quick unpaid stops at the parking meter 
anymore - not if Fred Mitchell has his way. The Canadian inventor has 
developed a new meter that can nab drivers that try to avoid paying for 
parking.  The meter is equipped with a digital camera - the camera, in turn, 
is connected to a cell phone.  When a car pulls into the parking spot, the 
meter knows - and waits for the driver to pay.  If no cash shows up within a 
minute or two, the meter snaps a picture of the car's license plate, and 
transmits it to a central office where a ticket is printed. And worse, no 
more using other people's meter time.  The meter can tell when a car leaves, 
and wipes any unused time to zero.

Kilts are not native to Scotland. They originated in France.
PLASTIC TO REPLACE SILICON IN SCREENS?
<br>
Next time you feel like throwing your laptop out a five-storey window… well, 
go ahead!  Maybe not yet.. but in five years it's expected a new type of 
laptop screen could make your computer much more resilient. The transistors 
in today's laptop screens are made of silicon - which, while bright and 
colourful, might not exactly be the toughest material in the world. Now, 
researchers at IBM have developed a way to make the same transistors used in 
LCD screens out of ordinary plastic.  Better yet - they'll be cheaper to 
make and cost less. And it's not just computer screens - one cell phone 
manufacturer says it's managed to keep electrical properties in plastic… 
meaning you might not need a battery at all - you'd just recharge the casing 
of your phone… in the future.

SPEND, SPEND, SPEND!
<br>
There's a whole lot of money coming down the pipe for e-commerce - and you 
can thank the year 2000 bug for it. Next year will be a huge year for 
companies moving into e-business - everything from moving their supply chain 
online to providing services over the Internet. Why?  It's all because 
computer systems managers in medium- and large-sized companies will have 
their IT budgets freed up.  You see, until now most of their budgets have 
been bled dry by getting their computers ready for the turn of the century. 
In fact, it's been like that for a couple of years. In those years, 
significant improvements have been made in electronic commerce, customer 
relationship management, and data warehousing.

Camel's-hair brushes are not made of camel's hair. They were invented by a 
man named Mr. Camel.

CHURCHES SEE THE DIGILIGHT
<br>
It had to happen sooner or later... your church may be going high-tech in 
the future. It's happening already in Stuttgart, where parishioners who turn 
up to church without any cash handy for the collection need only insert 
their smart card into a special bank machine at the back.  The machine 
withdraws the donation, or offers to calculate an appropriate tithe. So far, 
it's a boon for the church - donations are up more than 20 per cent… most of 
it because each heavenly transaction spits out a tax receipt - something the 
donation plate doesn't provide. And the church also likes the fact they 
don't have to spend an hour counting change after each service.

<p>
WIND-UP LAPTOPS
<br>
You've probably been there - in a plane, trying desperately to coax those 
previous last few seconds of battery juice out of your laptop computer. Well 
in the future, you might be able to just wind your laptop up to get more 
power. Freeplay, a U.S. company is said to be quietly in talks with GE to 
develop a combination wind-up and solar-power pack for notebooks.  And this 
isn't too far down the pipe - you can expect announcements some time next 
year.  They've got history behind them - Freeplay is the company that is 
putting wind-up radios in developing countries.  No word yet how much 
cranking you'll have to do per email message or spreadsheet calculation, but 
they're looking into how easy it would be to marry the crank with an "ultra 
capacitor" - a new kind of storage device that retains its charge far longer 
than batteries.  Even today's early prototypes can be charged and discharged 
millions of times, compared to just a few hundred cycles for traditional 
batteries.
