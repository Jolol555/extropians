While these ideas should be obvious to others most are not.  We take
medician and all the trickle down products almost totally for granted in
this country.

<p>
Another thing that most people do not understand is that the proceedures
and treatment done in the end stages of peoples lives serve to further
medician much more than the everyday proceedures.  It is by operating on
the person who will die in 3 months anyways that we learn how to do an
operation that will give someone 3 years of added life in the future.
