Abstract
<br>
  Ascorbic acid recycling from dehydroascorbic
  acid and biosynthesis from gulono-1,4-lactone were used as
  measures of cellular response capacity to increased oxidative stress induced
  by tert-butylhydroperoxide. The hepatic ascorbic acid
  concentration was 54% lower in cells from old rats when compared to cells
  isolated from young rats (P&lt;0.0005). Freshly isolated hepatocytes from old
  rats exhibited a significantly decreased ascorbic acid
  recycling capacity in response to oxidative stress (P&lt;0.005) compared to
  cells from young rats. Ascorbic acid synthesis in these
  cells from old animals was unaffected by various concentrations of
  tert-butylhydroperoxide, but amounted to only approximately half of the
  biosynthetic rate when compared to cells from young animals (P&lt;0.001). Cells
  from young animals were not significantly affected by the
  tert-butylhydroperoxide treatments. The results demonstrate a declining
  ability with age to respond to increased oxidative stress. (R)-alpha-Lipoic
  acid, a mitochondrial coenzyme, is a powerful antioxidant. A
  two-week dietary supplementation of old animals with 0.5% (R)-alpha-lipoic
  acid prior to cell isolation almost completely reversed the
  age-associated effects on ascorbic acid concentration
<br>
  (P&lt;0.0001), recycling (P&lt;0.05) and biosynthesis after oxidative stress. These<br>
  results provide further evidence for the potential of alpha-lipoic
  acid in treatment of diseases related to oxidative stress.
  Furthermore, the study extends the value of ascorbic acid as
  a biomarker of oxidative stress.
