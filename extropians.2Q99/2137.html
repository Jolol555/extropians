True (though criminals in the UK are increasingly arming themselves), but 
not particularly useful, since Britain has one of the lowest murder rates 
in the world and hasn't changed greatly for a century or so; I think it's 
about 50% higher today than when Britons could carry concealed at will. 
Several of those states have murder rates comparable to Continental 
European countries, which also generally have very strict gun laws 
compared to America. Remove the drug-dealing-related inner city murders 
and the entire country isn't much worse than Europe.

<p>
But anyway, why is it that those states -- with more guns and less 
restrictions -- are seeing reductions in violent crime while</a> Britain 
-- with fewer guns and more restrictions -- is becoming increasingly 
violent?

<p>
Personally I'd happily trade a slightly larger chance of being murdered 
for being armed and a greatly reduced chance of being attacked at random 
by drunken idiots.
