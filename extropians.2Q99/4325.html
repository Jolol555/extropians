Tell that you would *personally* consider uploading - copying self to
machine then chopping up original body for dogfood - without someone first
assuring you, beyond all doubt, that it really would be you in that
computer. I wouldn't, but then I'm entirely ego driven.

<p>
I find it intensely interesting that the "hard problem" is actually moving
from the domain of the esoteric philosophy to that of a concrete, real world
problem which desperately needs to be resolved. It may be that uploading
needs to become possible before the problem can be solved; then we have
something of an experimental paradigm available.

Hint: Don't upload the rodents as test, Tranhuman models. That's what
they've been waiting for...
