anyone with $2.50 to spare could get a license to carry a gun, and a 
gentleman's suit came with a 'pistol pocket' for precisely that reason; at
the time -- prior to the growth of organized crime and corrupt government
during Prohibition -- the American murder rate was roughly the same. And 
back then there were only a few dozen armed robberies with guns in London
each year, whereas today there are many thousands.

<p>
So yes, the number of shooting deaths has probably gone down since the
first anti-gun laws... but the number of murders has gone up, and the
number of armed crimes has gone up massively. This whole 'banning guns
reduces shooting deaths and we don't care about brains-beaten-out-of-the
-skull deaths' is typical anti-gun spin; I'm concerned about being killed,
I don't care whether I'm killed in the 'uncivilized' American fashion with
a bullet or the 'civilized' British fashion by having my brains bashed out
with a blunt object. Actually, thinking about it, I'd rather be shot.

<p>
Also worth noting is that there are a couple of states in America with 
similar murder rates to Britain despite -- or most likely because of -- comparatively lax gun laws; the US murder rate figures are massively
inflated because of shootouts between inner-city drug dealers. Since 
Britain doesn't have the same kind of 'War on Drugs' such shootouts are 
rare, though the cigarette smugglers have been shooting each other fairly
regularly in the last couple of years, including a couple of drive-bys;
with massive cigarette taxes in Britain and little or none some places on
the Continent, smuggling is a multi-billion-dollar industry today.

<p>
Interestingly, about eighteen months ago the British press was full of 
stories about 'getting guns off the streets' by banning legal handguns. 
As of a week or two ago after a TV presenter was shot dead on her doorstep, 
the press was full of stories bemoaning the ease with which criminals could
buy or rent illegal handguns for use in crimes. Uh guys, we told you that
back when you were pushing to ban them, I notice you didn't mention it
then...

<p>
<a href="2032.html#2097qlink2">&gt;If the population of the UK was scaled up to match the population of the USA</a><br>

<p>
No. Per-capita, many crime rates are much higher in Britain than America,
for example assaults are more than twice as common; see the DoJ report at
<a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cjusew96.htm">http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cjusew96.htm</a>. 

<p>
But hey, you're less likely to be shot, just more likely to be beaten to
a pulp in the street by some drunken asshole... Gotta be a win.
