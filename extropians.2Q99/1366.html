<p>
Because it would be nice to have a life where I didn't have to spend half
my time working to pay for the policies put in place by well-meaning idiots
and envious assholes and to be able to live in peace without the hostility
created by those policies. Unfortunately I can't, because more and more of
you always crawl out of the woodwork no matter how many times your ideas are
shown to lead to nothing but a war of all against all. "War is Peace", right?

Now maybe it's just that I'm not schizophrenic, but your four comments
here are clearly contradictory. According to you, if I believe in property
rights, I'm like a child who needs a psychological crutch and has no
control whatsoever of my life. Gosh, how respectful of you. Thanks a bunch.

<p>
<a href="1344.html#1366qlink6">&gt;And why do you imagine that I have any desire to force you</a><br>

<p>
Uh, because you can't eliminate property rights without forcing me to do
so as well? Because you can't have a society where everyone gets everything
for free without forcing us to work for you? Because communism and socialism
are totally impossible on a large scale without coercion?

<p>
Indeed. And if you throw out your silly utopian dreams you'll do a lot better
at it.

"You're inferior, I'm superior, I know everything, I must help you to enlightenment"

<p>
Yet you said:

Pot meet Kettle. Kettle meet Pot. You seem to be projecting all your faults
out into the world and pretending they're ours, rather than dealing with
them yourself.
