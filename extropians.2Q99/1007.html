Ok, I found this dated March 99

Assisted Suicide Pushed in California
<br>
SACRAMENTO -- March 1999 -- California could become the second state 
in the nation to legalize assisted suicide under a bill introduced by 
an East Bay egislator. 
<br>
Patterned after Oregon's pro-assisted suicide law, the proposal by 
Assemblywoman Dion Aroner, D-Berkeley, would allow physicians to 
prescribe poison to terminally ill patients who have asked to take 
their own lives. 
<br>
The patients, who would have to be expected to be within six months 
of dying, would then have to take the drugs themselves. 
The measure is sure to face powerful opposition from pro-life groups, 
some medical organizations, groups representing disabled people and 
the Catholic Church. 
<br>
California voters rejected a slightly different so-called "death with 
dignity" initiative in 1992, but Aroner's bill is the first effort to 
seriously push the idea since Oregon voters made their state the 
first in the nation to legalize assisted suicide. In 1994 and again 
in 1997, voters there approved pro-assisued suicide initiatives. 
In 1998, the first year the Oregon law was in effect, 15 terminally 
ill people ended their lives with lethal medication. Eight other 
people obtained lethal prescriptions, but six died of their illnesses 
before taking the drugs and the other two were living when the study 
ended Jan. 1.
