Gender-Specific Differences Found In Human Brain 
Toronto (April 20, 1999) -- Men and women's brains are distinctly 
different. While men have more neurons in the cerebral cortex, the 
brain's outer layer, women have more neuropil, which contains the 
processes allowing cell communication. Research showing these genderspecific
 differences was presented during the American Academy of 
Neurology 51st Annual Meeting April 17 -- 24, 1999, in Toronto. 
<br>
"The cerebral cortex is responsible for voluntary movements, <br>
perception of sensory input and of highly complex functions such as 
memory, learning, reasoning and language," said Gabrielle de Courten-
 MD, study author and associate professor of neuropathology at 
the University of Cincinnati. "Males possess more tightly packed and 
more numerous nerve cells (neurons) than females. Neurons send and 
receive electrical signals that influence many functions of the body 
and create thoughts and feelings. Females tend to have more neuropil, 
the fibular tissue that fills the space between nerve cell bodies and 
contains mainly nerve cell processes (synapses, dendrites and axons) 
that enable neurons to communicate with numerous other nerve cells." 

<p>
This research may explain previous findings that women are more prone 
to dementing illnesses than are men. Although a man and woman may 
lose the same number of neurons due to a disease, such as dementia, 
the woman's functional loss may be greater because the cells lost are 
more densely connected with other neurons. Added de Courten-Myers, 
<br>
"Conversely, in males, the 'functional reserve' may be greater as a <br>
larger number of nerve cells are present, which could prevent some of 
the functional losses." 

<p>
<a name="0913qlink2">Although these gender-specific variations cause tangible differences 
in how the brain functions, one type is not "better" or "worse" than 
the other. Said de Courten-Myers, "It seems reasonable to assume that 
specific functions may benefit from the presence of more cells while 
others may be enhanced by a larger number of connections between 
them. A better understanding of these issues may potentially affect a 
wide spectrum of human activities such as health care, psychology and 
teaching."

<p>
The researchers measured the cortex thickness and counted nerve cells 
from various sites within the healthy brains of 17 deceased subjects 
(10 males and seven females). 

<p>
<a name="0913qlink3">"The recognition of gender-specific ways of thinking and feeling -- <br>
rendered more credible given these established differences -- could 
prove beneficial in enhancing interpersonal relationships." Said de 
Courten-Myers, "However, the interpretation of the data also has the 
potential for abuse and harm if either gender would seek to construct 
evidence for superiority of the male or female brain from these 
findings."
