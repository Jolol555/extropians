The Insta-check system is such a system. However, the FBI and ATF is using this
system to keep records like a registration system, which is against both law and
the constitution. I don't mind insta-check that much, so long as my record of
purchase gets deleted. NOTE: The feds have not prosecuted one person since the
Insta-check system was instituted for illegal attempted purchase of a firearm. Its
been working for a year now. Paper tigers, anyone?</a>

Not at all. There is absolutely no reason all of these functions cannot be
satisfied under the insurance/PPA/PPL model for a libertarian/free market anarchy
society. Those that wish to live in no-right-to-carry communities can do so, and
their PPA will enforce that wish under their standard contracts. I suggest you
research this area before you baldly state that only a government can do this.
