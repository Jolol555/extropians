Yes. I've had people mail me after discussions on mailing lists to say that
they've looked up the facts and studies I've pointed out and that's changed
their opinion on the issue. I can't think of any occasion when one of the
people participating in such a thread has changed their mind, but several
lurkers have. Nor can I think of an occasion when someone's admitted to
starting out pro-gun and being convinced by the anti-gun arguments.</a>

<a name="2837qlink2">The big problem with this idea that the pro-gun folks on the list should
be nice, reasonable people and refuse to respond to irrational, unreasonable 
anti-gun posts is that when people who've never seen the pro-gun arguments 
continue to not see them because us nice, reasonable people refuse to point 
them out, they continue to believe the anti-gun arguments; you don't convince
people by keeping your mouth shut. The correct response by those who don't
like gun debates is for them to jump on the anti-gun posters as soon as they 
try to start one, not to complain about us when we respond; I can't think 
of any occasion when a pro-gun poster has started one of these debates.
