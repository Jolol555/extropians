You too?  Yes, I also experienced the most prolonged sense of irreality (reality?)
that I have ever felt after leaving a film.  It was very intense for at least an
hour afterward.  I even had an occasion 'flashback' when though about over the
proceeding week.

I have always been an adrenaline junkie - fast cars, skydiving, etc.  Now that I'm
entering my thirties I am starting to mellow.  This film made me feel like a kid
again with the same intensity to break loose.

Yes, it could set a negative precedent for the ideas of radical technological
change.  When I first learned of nanotechnology back in 1986 while attending the
University of Arizona, I was simultaneously astounded and disturbed by its
implications.  For the first year, my mind was  reeling from the possibilities and
especially the pitfalls of advanced molecular nanotechnology.  The essential
essence behind 'The Matrix' was one of a myriad number of hell's that I pictured.
Several times during my first year of trying to grasp the fuller potential of
nanotechnology, I asked myself many times, is my entire life a simulation in a
nanotech matrix?   Maybe nanotechnology was invented in the 1960's and we are
already being enslaved.  Maybe reality is a simulation being run by aliens who
created us out of their own imagination.  By the second year, such metaphysical and
sometimes dark speculation bordered on the absurd.  I decided it was healthier to
adopt an more optimistic and pro-active attitude, while remaining skeptically open
minded about the nature of reality.
