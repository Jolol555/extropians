A good idea for those of us who are physically able to do so. I must admit
I wish I had more exposure to martial arts; so far i have not been able to
find time to get started.

a wheelchair, for instance? Someone with one arm in a cast?</a>

Yeah, I know - someone's going to bring up the case where a family member
came in late at night and got shot. Here's a case where the shooter did not
verify that an intrusion had actually taken place before firing. Bad</a> or no
training, or just trigger happy. Some of the problem is resolved by
requiring certification to buy weapons.

<a name="3601qlink4">Here in my county, I have heard tell of the sherriff's police advising
citizens to be sure any intruder they shoot 'falls inside the house' so
that the shooting is justifiable - even if this involves dragging that
person a few feet. They don't want to charge someone who is defending
themselves.</a>

<p>
<a name="3601qlink5">One of the great travesties of our legal system is the way the victim has
become the persecuted - criminals successfully suing because of injuries
suffered in commission of crimes. Such suits (civil) would be rejected by
any sensible person, but our judges and juries seem to think otherwise,
when confronted by a cunning attorney.
