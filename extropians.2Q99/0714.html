<p>
It does.

<p>
&gt; Do photons from a laser upon impact of a reflective surface cause an
&gt; inertial reaction, no matter how infinitesimal?

<p>
They do.

<pre>
&gt; If lasers have no "kick" upon firing, and photons from a coherent laser
&gt; do cause an inertial reaction, then lasers could be used as reactionless
&gt; propulsion.

Im not sure I understand the question, but lasers (or any light source,
coherent
<br>
or otherwise) can be used as a propulsion device, altho not an energy
efficient
<br>
one.  All you need to know is that momentum is conserved in such as system,
just as in a traditional propulsion system, and that the momentum of a
photon
<br>
is hn/c and the energy of that photon is hn where h is Planck's constant
and n  is the frequency of the photon.  With just that information you can
show that it is possible to push a mirror with photons, but it takes a lot
of energy to make just a small amount of delta V.

<p>
If we had nanotech, we could create extraordinarily thin mirrors in the
form of a lightsail, which could reflect sunlight (or laser light) for
propulsion.
