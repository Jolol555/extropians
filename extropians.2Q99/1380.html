I think this is the way to go. Especially wind-up satelite
phones. Wind-up PCs and phones are more liberating here than TVs and
radios, since broadcasting is still a centralized process. Free access
to information and communication is a very liberating technology that
makes many current dictatorships untenable or at least weaker. It
doesn't necessarily topple them (that is in the end up to the
citizens) but it gives more power and ability to the individual
people.

<p>
Of course, dumping stuff like this is no miracle cure, you need to
provide good information through it, ideally ensure that the users can
control their own information and set up their own (virtual)
institutions. 

<p>
In the case of Serbia (not that I have the least interest in debating
that affair), there seems to be some evidence that most of the
population is being fed a highly biased view of what is happening
through state media (unlike us, who just get biased media - but at
least can choose between them :-) and are actually quite misinformed
about what is happening. Here widespread access would undermine the
propaganda. But it wouldn't necessarily change the core problem;
people in Greece, who have access to much freer information, are still
strongly pro-Serbian (for historical, political and cultural
reasons). People won't turn into rational, nice people by having
communications technology - but it likely makes it harder to suppress
rationality and easier to get useful information to and from
elsewhere.
