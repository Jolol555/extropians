<a name="3948qlink5"><a name="3833qlink1">A simple, relatively low-tech improvement which could</a> easily 
be implemented *today* is the "gun-cam"; put a small camera 
module under the barrel in the same fashion as one would 
attach a laser/flashlight module. As (spy) cams can be made 
very compact without losing too much picture quality, the setup 
needn't be very bulky. You can even add some audio recording
equipment and perhaps even a data transmitter (burst 
transmission?) so that even if the gun is seized or destroyed
by the bad guys, you still have the evidence. The camera
could be activated by means of a (pressure) pad on the grip
<br>
(a method used for certain laser aiming systems, though<br>
I would personally prefer a system that reacts to pressure
on the trigger for those). That way you only film when it
counts. Further improvement could include a linked 
flashlight for when it's dark, and of course some safeties 
to prevent tampering with the data.

<p>
The advantage? Well, you basically make sure</a> that there's
a camera present at every shooting, filming from the position
which counts most -- that of the shooter. That way a jury/
judge/commission can see for themselves whether a shooting
was justified or not. At the very least every armed government
official should have one, and of course it's highly recommended 
for civilian use too.

<p>
Is such a thing already on the market? If not, I hereby claim
the idea... ;)
