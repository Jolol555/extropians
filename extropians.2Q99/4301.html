I must be missing something here, but no one has yet explained why they
consider the disassembled brain to be alive.  It cannot think by itself.
<a name="4311qlink1">Any thoughts must be preplanned and executed by the human caretakers for the
</a>brain.  It can be "stimulated" just as a dead brain can.  But it does not
react to the stimulus.  No neuron fires unless its caretaker fires it.  No
memory occurs unless the caretaker stored the memory.

<p>
The entire modeling process can occur in the absence of the so-called brain.
If there is a consciousness, it is contained by all the living humans who
are doing the brain modeling.  The dead brain neurons are not processing,
communicating, remembering, thinking or reacting.  The are acting no
differently than a dead brain would act.  They are just being placed in
proximity to living humans who are modeling a brain.  What am I missing that
makes this disembodied brain meet any definition of consciousness?

<p>
I agree with the apparent aim of these "thought experiments", that is to
lead a person to realize that consciousness can be contained in non-human
brains.  I disagree with the specific example that claims the dissected
brain is still alive and functional because every separate neuron remains
intact.  As a psychology minor and a biology minor, I am adamant that this
brain is not alive or conscious by any definition I know.
