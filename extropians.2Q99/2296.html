<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  I'm actually curious as to where you get your information.  If </i><br>
<i>&gt; someone  has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  the ability to use violent force, they are going to be less violent?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  don't see how this is logical.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; 	hehe hmmm... so whaddya think of martial artists? are we more likely </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; to be violent? how does that fit in to this? and whats the diff between </i><br>
<i>&gt; an </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; average martial artist and an average guy with a gun?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Hmmm...howzabout the ability to kill a dozen people at a hundred </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  yards in ten seconds (supposing black-beltish marksmanship </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  skills)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	yup, theres a diff there; a matter of scale. but how many of these </i><br>
<i>&gt; black-beltish marksmen do we have killing innocents? very very few. thats my </i><br>
<i>&gt; point.</i><br>
&gt;
<br>
We've got a lot of kids shooting each other, and that takes no 
training whatsoever, therefore there is no chance for discipline to be 
instilled; that's my point.
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2285.html#2296qlink2">&gt; &gt;  &gt; 	i think the main diff is education. many martial artists, like many </a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; legal gun owners, know what their doing, and how to do it, and what it </i><br>
<i>&gt; does, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; and what the reprocussions of using their violence are. they are not  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; ignorant about their ability for violence. ergo, they are more likely to </i><br>
<i>&gt; be </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; intellegent in their use of violence... and i think that makes all the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  If they're responsible, I have no problem with them keeping and </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  bearing, but if they have been legitimately identified as </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  irresponsible, they should have to relinquish.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="2301qlink1"><i>&gt; 	i have no problem with that, in theory... but shit. slopes are </i><br>
<i>&gt; slippery, and making laws forcing the goons to relinquish their weapons </i><br>
<i>&gt; requires, well, making laws, which means trusting politicians</a> to understand </i><br>
<a name="2301qlink2"><i>&gt; the fine ethical line that i think is being treaded here... basicly,</a> i agree </i><br>
<a name="2301qlink3"><i>&gt; with your goals but not your methods; i think ole crocker &amp; lorray's approach </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be, functionally, the lonterm lesser of two evils.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
There is no other feasible method, and the only way to test mine is 
in practice.  It is strange to find such a Luddite mentality towards 
experimentation, evolution,  trial, error , refinement and repair on a 
purportedly futuristic list allegedly concerned with the improvement 
</a>
of the quality and circumstances of life.
