I really don't have a problem with this.

<p>
Sure, I'd like to see some exotic technology in action -- as probably most
of you on this list would.  BUT if it was my money I'd probably not try to
reinvent the wheel.  As far as space commercialization and privatization
(and eventual colonization) are concerned, I think what works works.  We
should not wed ourselves, even if just emotionally, to any particular launch
technology.

<p>
Cheers!
