<p>
The physiological and psychological effects of placebos has in many cases
been proven to be almost as effective as physioactive or psychoactive drugs
in the treatment of many disorders.  Many drugs have a very large placebo
effect compared to their actual effects.

<p>
Of course, most drugs do have physioactive or psychoactive effects, and I am
not disclaiming or disproving statistically proven effects.

<p>
Laughter as a coping mechanism is shown to have positive health effects.
The power of the body to heal itself is a wonderful thing.  The power of the
body to fool itself is a thing.

<p>
Antibiotics are great things, anaesthetics and analgesics are good for the
blocking of pain, and wine is good for conversation.

<p>
I am not a doctor and make no medical claims.  Remember to brush your teeth,
modern diets have large amounts of sugars and other cavity causing
contents.  Read the labels on food and be aware of what exactly one is
ingesting.

<p>
Meditation and other forms of self-enlightenment are powerful tools to
attain good health.

<p>
Modern medicine is incredible and I am in awe of it.  Examples are
microvascular surgery, cancer cures, and anti-viral treatments, among many
other wonderful things.  There are surgeries to correct poor vision.

<p>
We might envision a time in the not so far future where all physical
ailments are successfully treatable.  This leads to further impetus towards
space exploration and colonization, and general research and development, as
well as ecological and environmental conservation, preservation, and
rejuvenation.  It also makes real estate that much more valuable, and the
need for population controls sadly necessary, but not interminably so, as
humanity spreads throughout the solar system and beyond.
