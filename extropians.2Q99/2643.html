<a href="2634.html#2643qlink2">&gt; Women will shock men at the end of a date cause they don't want to go through the</a><br>
<i>&gt; unpleasantness of telling the guy to buzz off and risk a bad response to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rejection.</i><br>

<p>
Maybe a in a handful of cases, the woman in question being a seriously
disturbed individual or completely whacked out on dope. Normal people
don't do stuff like that (tasers and stun guns have been available for a
long time, and are seldom used for "whimsical" stunning, afaik). 

<p>
<a href="2634.html#2643qlink3">&gt; Making the consequences of employing force high forces people to deal with a</a><br>
<i>&gt; situation as well as they can FIRST without resorting to any force, whether it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; lethal or non-lethal.</i><br>

<p>
This only applies only to *rational* people, and most criminals are by definition
not very rational. My guess is that people who aren't violent now won't all
of a sudden become trigger-happy maniacs if they buy a phaser, but will
remain civilized and responsible. Those most likely to abuse the weapon
are people who were violent or unstable anyway, and if they'll now use a 
non-lethal phaser instead of a gun or kitchen knife, that will save a lot
of lives. Often the reaction after shooting/stabbing someone [in a domestic
fight] is "oh my gawd, I didn't mean to do this". Fortunately, this time there 
*is* a second chance.
