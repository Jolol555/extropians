<a name="0205qlink1"><a href="0118.html#0125qlink1">&gt; It is also reasonable to assume that when one is electing one's leaders,</a><br>
<i>&gt; that bad publicity is not necessarily better than none, and pro wrestlers</i><br>
<i>&gt; are notorious dissemblers.</i><br>

<p>
It is not reasonable to assume that, and it's irrelevant here anyway
because the bad reputation you impute to wrestlers does not exist.
They are merely entertainers, and everyone knows that, and they have
no more of a reputation for lying than a fiction author or filmmaker
would.  I am sure Mr. Ventura's grass-roots campaigning and charming
personaility in the debates put him over the top in this election:
but he wouldn't have been there at all without the name recognition he
got from being an entertainer.  How many of those voters he swayed
in the debate would have even watched the show if he had been Harold
Schwartz, accountant from St. Paul?</a>
