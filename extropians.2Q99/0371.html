Sanders Wins Space Supercomputer Contract
 Nashua - April 7, 1999 - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's 
<br>
(NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has notified Sanders, a Lockheed <br>
Martin Company, that the company has been selected for Phase-II of the Remote 
Exploration and Experimentation (RE&amp;E) supercomputing technology project.
The $6 million RE&amp;E contract will result in a demonstration of a low-power, 
scalable, high-performance computer with on-board processing capabilities 
that will enable NASA to conduct a new class of space science missions. 
During the next nine months, Sanders will demonstrate a computing system 
capable of at least 30 million-operations-per-second (MOPS) per watt. In 
addition to making possible a new class of space science missions, the 
technology will reduce operational costs for NASA and will contribute to the 
development of next-generation small satellites for deep space missions.

<p>
In May 1996, Sanders received one of five study contracts to examine the 
feasibility and trade-offs involved in the development of scalable 
supercomputing for space. In January 1998, the company won one of two Phase-I 
RE&amp;E contracts to design an architecture for future, power-efficient space 
processors. From this most recent competitive down-selection, Sanders was 
selected for the program to apply earth-based supercomputing technology to a 
test bed computing system, leading to flight computers for missions in 
2003-2005.
