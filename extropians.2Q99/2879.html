<p>
Oh, yes.  There was one case where somebody crossed two related butterfly
species that both had multiple color patterns.  Turned out the gene that
turned *on* a pattern in one species turned it *off* in another.  The
researchers were quite surprised.

<p>
It's not the usual pattern, though.

Another possibility is that the details of the genetic background may make a 
difference. People have found conflicting results for longevity when you
splice in extra antioxidant genes in flies.  Careful research showed it
varied with the flies you spliced it into - some flies benefitted from the
gene while other flies of the same species were hurt.
(I do have this reference handy - "FLP Recombinase-Mediated Induction of 
Cu/Zn-Superoxide Dismutase Transgene Can Extend the Life Span of Adult 
Drosophila Melanogaster Flies"  Jingtao Sun and John Tower, Molecular 
and Cellular Biology, Jan 1999.  Sorry, no page number since my copy's a 
preprint.)
