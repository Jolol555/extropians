Oh yes, you can spend a vast amount of time creating all these complicated
profit protection schemes, but in the end it's totally pointless. The fact
is, if you're selling information then at some point you have to display
that information to the user, and at that point they can capture it in a 
free form and pass it on to anyone they desire. The only way to prevent
this is to also have total control over the operating system and CPU as well
as the software.

As for software, I've lost count of the number of companies who've lost my
business because of their stupid dongles and profit protection crap; I just
won't buy software which may suddenly refuse to run for its own bizarre
reasons, and no company with a clue would buy software which will stop 
working if their Net connection goes down.
