<p>
Anger has many meanings.  In speaking of "counting to 10" and mediation,
you seem to be looking at the relatively short-lived emotional response:
the flaring nostrils, rush of adrenalin, heavy breathing, blind sense
of rage which occasionally we all feel.

<p>
You are no doubt right that much violence occurs in the throes</a> of this
kind of short lived anger.  But I would guess that most violent attacks
and deaths do not occur in such a state.

<p>
<a name="3388qlink1">First, you have the entire area of deaths by warfare and genocide.
In this century alone we have seen Hitler's holocaust, Stalin's purges,
the killing fields of Cambodia, and many other instances of mass murder.</a>
These number in the tens of millions and surely far outnumber individual
murders.  Most of the people involved were not commiting these acts in
a burst of passionate anger.

<p>
Even among murders and attacks, only a fraction occur in the throes of an
outburst of temper such as you are describing as anger.  Others are the
result of long-simmering resentments, or even cold blooded calculation
of advantage.

<p>
And anger is not always bad.  Meek and mild people are often taken
advantage of.  The angry person speaks up and complains to the management.
She makes the sales clerk deal with the customers in line rather than
answering the phone.  He forces his associate to follow through on a
business commitment rather than backing off when difficulties arise.

<p>
<a name="3388qlink2">Anger has arisen and been maintained through evolution because it
serves a purpose.  Anger can give people strength and courage to break
through social and natural barriers that they could not normally manage.</a>
Anger blinds us, yes; but sometimes we have needed to be blinded, so that
our actions are not constrained and we can act with necessary intensity
and speed.

<p>
Of course, ultimately, all of our emotions, anger, love, fear, hope, are
a rather crude form of motivation and guidance.  If we didn't have fear
or love, we might not need anger.<a name="3090qlink1">  Perhaps as transhumans we will be able
to substitute rationality for all our</a> emotions.  We will be the Vulcans
<a name="3388qlink3">of Star Trek, always logical and rational.  Does this sound desirable?</a>

<p>
<a name="3388qlink4">Or, as long as we're fantasizing, let's pretend that we can only get
rid of the "bad" emotions and keep the "good" ones.</a>  We'll keep love
<a name="3388qlink5">and discard hate, keep happiness and discard sadness.  We'll become
Teletubbies.  What a marvelous future this will</a> be.

<p>
<a name="3388qlink6"><a name="3254qlink1"><a name="3104qlink1"><a name="3086qlink1">I am torn between the desire to control my emotions, and the desire
to feel my emotions.  Should I fight anger, or should I glory</a> in it?
</a>
</a>
</a>
Philosophers have different views on this.  Some say we are alienated from
our emotions and need to stop trying to suppress and control our deeper
selves.  Others advocate a path of calmness and serenity, without strife
or, for that matter, striving.  No one answer is fully satisfying to me.
