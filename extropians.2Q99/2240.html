With the right knowledge we can eliminate the negative side of humanity.
Humanity will develop methods to control and regulate feelings and emotions,
increase intelligence, and eliminate mental illness. People will have a mental
heaven through mind-shaping. People will have healthy minds free from any mental
agony such as depression, because all mental illness will be cured. Humans will
discover how to access and unleash the full capabilities and power of the brain,
and thereby reach levels of intelligence and thought that takes the essence of
being to an unimaginably complete state of existence. Humanity will be able to
achieve control of the brain so one can elect to have any feeling or emotion
desired, or elect to avoid any feeling or emotion. One will be able to have pure
thought unaffected by feelings or emotions, and unrestrained by sensory or other
limitations. Such mind-shaping methods may involve the use of chemicals and/or
genetic engineering to enhance the pleasure pathways of the brain, and block
negative feedback pathways. This would result is a perpetual state of happiness,
pleasure, and joy. Boredom, anger and other negative feelings and emotions will
no longer plague man. People will be happy about being in a state of happiness,
a perpetual love of everything. Each individual will have the capability to
completely control their thoughts, and thereby be the god of their own universe,
the king of their mental sphere of existence.  Such full mental satisfaction
will have profound positive impacts on current paradigms. For example, drug
abuse, crime, and war will become obsolete, because mentally satisfied people
have no need or desire to engage in such activities. Predators will no longer
exist, and police will become unnecessary.
