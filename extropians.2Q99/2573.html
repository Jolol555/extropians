<a name="2625qlink1">I have been away from the list for over two years. I returned to see what was 
the latest Extropian topic in nano, technology, creativity and other 
futuristic realms, Yet this same topic - which clearly has two trajectories, 
is being re-hashed over and over as nauseum. It was ongoing when I left. Just 
like abortion, religion or taxation.. it continues ...wanking on and off and 
on and  off. Nothing changes. 
<br>
Suggestion:
<br>
Why not spend time thinking up new and fresh debates?
