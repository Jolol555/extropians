<p>
Yet property crime is higher in the UK, as ar assaults. Not to mention that demographically,
the US is far far different from the UK. I'll bet if you compare states with similar
demographics to the UK you'll see much more closer comparison.</a>

<a name="2199qlink2"><a href="2130.html#2152qlink2">&gt; &gt; According to that DoJ report I posted a URL for, in some areas (assault</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and property crimes) it has much higher crime levels than America; this</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; possible the DoJ are fudging the figures to make America look better, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they appear to have gone to some trouble to get accurate statistics by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; looking both at official police reports and victim surveys... and they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would seem to have a vested interest in making it look worse to get more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; funding.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Murder is the irreversible crime; it is the one which forever revokes</i><br>
<i>&gt; one's right to life, liberty, property and pursuit of happiness, as well</i><br>
<i>&gt; as the one to keep and bear arms.</i><br>

<p>
Thats right, but killing a criminal is not murder, and I'd much rather it were him and not me,
and I'd much rather trust my protection to myself than to.... well since the government is not
liable for protecting me, then I have no-one to trust but myself.</a>

<p>
<a name="2199qlink3">Here's a question: What do the gun controllers propose to give me in services in exchange for
my guns? Will they provide bodyguards? NO? Will they lock up anyone who ever exhibited a hint
of deviancy? NO? Will they pay for the prisons they will need to enforce the fascist state
they want to impose? NO? Well, then, no deal.</a>

<p>
<a name="2199qlink4">definition of fascism:
<br>
from Encyclopedia.com:

<p>
"philosophy of government that glorifies the nation-state at the expense
of the individual...  Fascism generally gains support by promising social
justice to discontented elements of the working and middle classes, and
social order to powerful financial interests."

<p>
Start enforcing the laws we already have before you come to me to ask that I give up more
freedoms...</a>
