  <li>  The only chance they have is cryonics.
  <li>  Be aware that even if you commit to making an effort to save them, you
will fail to convince the great majority of them.

I agree with Jeff Davis who states that reanimation for cryonic suspendees
is an almost certainty...eventually.   It should be added that important
advances have been made recently in the efficacy of cryoprotectants that
significantly reduce fracturing thanks to 21st Century Medicine, and further
advances are on the near horizon.</a>

Yes, Emlyn.  Be surprised.  Be very surprised.  There are a number of
individuals signed up for cryonic suspension because they believe it is a
highly rational option.  I fail to appreciate your analogies.  It is *not*
like buying a plot of ground in which I will decay and be irreversibly lost,
and cryonics is not about dying+hope.  Cryonicists do not believe that a
person is truly dead until the structure of the brain is irreversibly
degraded.  For us, the choice is unbelieveably simple:  die and rot or be
frozen and wait for technology to reanimate you.  If something happens to
prevent your reanimation (you're accidently defrosted), what exactly have
you lost?  I recommend you read a bit more on the subject by perusing the
web sites of cryonics firms, and the archives of the Cryonet mailing list.
