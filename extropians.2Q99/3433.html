The tail of sodium gas that streams out for great distances behind the Moon
has been observed better than ever before.

<p>
The new observations were made on the nights following the Leonid meteor
shower of November 1998.

<p>
The sodium atoms were blasted into space as tiny meteorites struck the lunar
soil, it is believed.

<p>
The tail of sodium gas was seen to stretch for distances of at least 800,000
kilometres (500,000 miles) behind the Moon. Its appearance changed over
three consecutive nights.

<p>
Thin atmosphere

<p>
Since the Apollo Moon program, scientists have known that the Moon has an
atmosphere, but it is extremely thin.

<p>
"It is one continuously being produced by evaporation of surface materials,<br>
and then continuously being lost by escape or impact back onto the surface,"
said Michael Mendillo, professor of astronomy at Boston University, where
the new research was conducted.

<p>
Ten years ago, ground-based telescopes revealed that sodium gas formed part
of the lunar atmosphere.

<p>
"There are less than 50 atoms of sodium per cubic centimetre in the<br>
atmosphere just above the surface of the Moon," says Jeffrey Baumgardner, of
Boston University's Centre for Space Physics.

<p>
In contrast there are ten thousand million billion molecules per cubic
centimetres in Earth's atmosphere at the surface.

<p>
Earthward bound

<p>
The researchers found that when the Moon is new, it takes two days or so for
sodium atoms leaving the surface to reach the vicinity of the Earth.

<p>
They are pushed away from the Moon by the pressure of sunlight and, as they
sweep past us, the Earth's gravity pulls on them, focusing them into a long
narrow tail.

<p>
If the Moon's sodium tail were perhaps a thousand times brighter it would be
bright enough for the human eye to see. It would appear as a glowing orange
cloud dominating the night-time sky.
