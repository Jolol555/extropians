<a href="0765.html#0783qlink1">&gt;As far as it helps us reach our goals, it is not very productive. Perhaps</a><br>
<i>&gt;indirectly, yes, by relieving stress or strengthening bonds or what have</i><br>
<i>&gt;you, but not directly. These things can be achieved in other ways. My point</i><br>
<i>&gt;is that sex was originally created for procreation, and now that we have</i><br>
<i>&gt;more than enough people on the planet we really don't need much more of</i><br>
<i>&gt;that.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0842qlink1"><a name="0797qlink1">I don't know that "bond-strenghtening" between couples can really be
achieved without sex, at least not at this point. I know of several
relationships that were severely harmed by lack of sexual activity.</a> It turns
</a>
<a name="0797qlink2">the relationship into a deep friendship with no romantic component
whatsoever, and this overall is not a good thing in a marriage</a> or similar
<a name="0797qlink3">long-term relationship. Once again, future technology may</a> change this, but
<a name="0797qlink4">as it stands I don't know of a substitute. Humans connect sex</a> with emotional
<a name="0842qlink2"><a name="0797qlink5">intimacy, and that intimacy is what keeps a relationship going.</a>
