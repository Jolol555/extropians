<a href="4615.html#4620qlink1">&gt; Bryan, I do sincerely hope you wrote this in jest.  I think something</a><br>
<i>&gt; a bit more temporary might be a better deal, some chemical that one</i><br>
<i>&gt; can choose to stop injesting at any time, which would have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; permanent effect.  spike</i><br>

<p>
There are several drugs currently available that can do this - Depo
Provera and Depo Lupron are the two I know about.  Depo Lupron has
severe side effects that sometimes last for years after the drug has
been discontinued.  Both have been used on sex offenders to control
their sex drives.

<p>
At current levels of technology, this is a pretty dangerous thing to do,
as testosterone is essential to health.
