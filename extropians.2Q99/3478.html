<a name="3485qlink1">Thanks for bringing this up Emlyn.  I hope everyone who speculates
about a humaned mission to Mars will review the findings of the great
Biosphere experiment.  It is actually shocking to see how much mass
and volume is evidently needed to keep even one person alive for
extended periods of time in a closed system.  I was quite discouraged
when, with *aaaaall thaaaaat stuuuuuffff*, they *stilll* had a hell of a
time.  {8-[  spike
