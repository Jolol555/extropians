<p>
Yes, I believe we've been here before.  I defined "definition" and then
you claimed that I hadn't really defined it, because my explanation
required a being capable of understanding definitions and was therefore
circular - which, when I think about it, means that I would have had to
define "definition" to a rock.

<p>
Definitions come in two categories.  The first is useless definitions
somebody is using to advance an argument.  The second is the
"definition" that tells you how to build something.  When I defined
"definition", I was giving a capsule description of how to construct a
mind that would accept definitions.  We're looking for the definition of
consciousness and qualia that will let us construct conscious,
qualia-bearing minds.  Do you really think this is insipid?

<p>
<a href="4333.html#4350qlink2">&gt;     &gt;then there is no "fact of the matter" as to whether any given</a><br>
<i>&gt;     &gt;computation is instantiated in any given system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If a computation (or a thought) does something like print a result or just</i><br>

<i>&gt; no senses or actuators and am permanently isolated from the rest of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe then it's meaningless to ask when a thought occurred, not just for</i><br>
<i>&gt; an external observer but it's meaningless for me too. When did "green"</i><br>
<i>&gt; happen?</i><br>

<p>
Would you say that since this Universe (or Reality or whatever) has no
input-output characteristics, it doesn't exist?  If I toss you through
an event horizon, do you stop being conscious as soon as you're cut off
from the external world?

<p>
<a name="4372qlink1">I do not understand this emphasis on input-output characteristics as an
arbiter of consciousness.</a>  Hashtables are not people.

<p>
<a href="4333.html#4350qlink3">&gt; So is an intelligent lookup table conscious?</a><br>
<i>&gt; Certainly not, my brain is not conscious either although both imply</i><br>
<i>&gt; Consciousness. Many (not all) of the problems surrounding this issue can</i><br>
<i>&gt; Be avoided if you think of consciousness as an adjective not a noun.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A racing car is not "fast" it goes fast, it's a demonstration of speed,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and my brain is a demonstration, the only demonstration, of a particular</i><br>
<i>&gt; sort of consciousness, the sort that calls itself "John Clark".</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4372qlink2">Does that mean that you would exist even in the absence of a particular
demonstration?</a>  This is Platonic consciousness, right?  I also agree
that Turing computations are Platonic objects.  I further say that
either all Platonic objects exist, or none do - there's no is_real()
function.  Do you think that every possible version of yourself already
exists and is just as real as you are?

<p>
<a href="4333.html#4350qlink4">&gt; What about the intelligent lookup table?</a><br>
<i>&gt; That would demonstrate the consciousness of the person who made the table.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4372qlink3">And if I keep generating lookup tables via quantum randomness for 3^^^^3
years, I do believe that I will eventually generate ones which perfectly
mock your I/O characteristics.</a>  If I set up a
random-lookup-table-generator and stick it in a nullentropic loop for
some insane number of years, will that generate all possible conscious
beings?  How about the digits of pi - does that work as well?

<p>
<a href="4333.html#4350qlink5">&gt; What if a bottle of ink were knocked over and just by blind chance it formed</a><br>
<i>&gt; the lookup table, would it be conscious then?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know or care because that is a physically impossible situation. It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; a situation that has never happened and almost certainly will never be seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; by any observer in the universe, and that's as good a definition of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "impossible" as you'll find.</i><br>

<p>
I see.<a name="4372qlink4">  And if I told you that the number of actual Universes in the
Reality is so large that it could only be expressed by Knuth notation,
that *anything* no matter how improbable has happened at least once due
to the sheer size of the Cosmic All... would that suddenly change the
basic laws that operate on my finite PowerPC?</a>  I don't think you can
make your philosophy dependent on the absolute size of the Universe;
<a name="4372qlink5">basic laws shouldn't be dependent on the existence, much less the
nonexistence, of items not in causal contact.</a>

<p>
<a href="4333.html#4350qlink6">&gt; What about Moravec's idea that a brain is determined by the relationship of</a><br>
<i>&gt; its parts and that involves an arbitrary interpretation so all possible minds</i><br>
<i>&gt; exist?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm an agnostic on the subject. All I know is that it's a tautology (and thus</i><br>
<i>&gt; true) that intelligent behavior implies intelligence and it's an axiom that</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence implies consciousness. Non intelligent behavior, like that</i><br>
<i>&gt; produced by a rock, may or may not imply consciousness. My hunch is not.</i><br>
