	hehe hmmm... so whaddya think of martial artists? are we more likely 
to be violent? how does that fit in to this? and whats the diff between an 
average martial artist and an average guy with a gun?</a>
<p>
<a name="2283qlink2">	i think the main diff is education. many martial artists, like many 
legal gun owners, know what their doing, and how to do it, and what it does, 
and what the reprocussions of using their violence are. they are not ignorant 
about their ability for violence. ergo, they are more likely to be 
intellegent in their use of violence... and i think that makes all</a> the 
difference.
