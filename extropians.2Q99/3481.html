The longest-lived racial group in America is asians, whose
female life expectancy is almost 90.  There are indications
that African-Americans are more likely to be genetically 
predisposed to hypertension that whites.  Since their ancestral
populations (West African blacks) have low hypertension rates,
some people have hypothesized that this resulted from the
extreme mistreatment their ancestors underwent during enslavement,
transportation, and slavery.  Conditions on slave ships would
have killed most people who don't retain salt.

<p>
However, anybody who thinks all relevant environmental causes
are controlled for with socioeconomic status is fooling himself.
There are lots of environmental factors we don't know about,
and things like the "French paradox" show they're important.
For example, a recent study showed African-Americans are far
less likely to get angiography than whites, even when their
symptoms are identical.
