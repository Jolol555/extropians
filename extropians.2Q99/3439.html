<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think Merced architecture is stale already well before it has become</i><br>

<i>&gt; Xilinx people need some watching, as well.</i><br>

<p>
Something else to note is that AMD may finally be able to
beat Intel performance with the new K7 series of chips due
out this month. They were designed by some of the people
that worked on the Alphas, and are definitely designed to
scale to high clock rates. And the motherboards may be
able to support up to 14 CPUs eventually, each with dedicated
memory access.

<p>
As for combining mem and CPUs together, I am not sure if
that will prevail. There are optical motherboard bus
technologies being developed that may eliminate that
bottleneck, and leave the flexibility of having separate
upgradable components.
