Actually, it's stories like this that are stupid; they support the myth that
the whole "race/difference thing" is just a matter of some irrelevant 
</a>
exterior features (or, at least it's often used for this purpose; it could be 
that Dr. Seuss was thinking of something else when he wrote it). Well, it 
ain't that simple. A far more intelligent story is that of I.M. Weasel and 
I.R. Baboon(1), the episode where they switch bodies. Initially the smart 
and successful Weasel suffers from Baboon's bad image (he's 
descriminated against), but by being himself he eventually restores 
his former position, and gaines everyone's respect once more. With 
baboon it's vice versa; he gets a free ride on weasel's good reputation, 
but by his dumb and obnoxious behaviour he ruins it and becomes an 
outcast once more.
