&gt;&gt; _really_ work for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?)

&gt; [Anecdote about CFS and fat consumption]<br>

<p>
<a name="2589qlink1"><a name="2580qlink1">Though most doctors now take CFS more seriously than in the past
(even CDC now recognizes it as a valid diagnosis), there is not
any evidence or consensus for a link to fat in the diet.  It is
probably a bad idea to spread that rumor, as it may encourage
someone to increase their fat intake and risk heart disease.</a>
It's probably not as bad, though, as recommending latest snake
oil peddled by the local drug pusher (i.e. "health food store").
A good place for up-to-date, understandable and responsible
