Still, people react to views strongly too, so even if I don't know who
anon4711 is I can still flame him/her/it.

Yes, this would likely work. But it has many drawbacks, since the
activity on a list is self-supporting: if there is a lull for some
time, it tends to persist since people are not cued by postings to
post themselves. Having a large, active and fairly stable list is
something relatively rare; a set of smaller extropians1, extropians2,
... extropians n lists would likely lead to less production of
exformation even if the number of flamewars would be much lower.
