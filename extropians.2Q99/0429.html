<a href="0375.html#0429qlink1">&gt;I take it that anyone with "the gift" _could_ be "the one", even</a><br>
<i>&gt;Morpheus. Kind of like any female honeybee can become Queen if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;stressors are right.</i><br>

<p>
Actually you can convert any bee to a queen (as a larva) by feeding
it the substance we call "Royal Jelly".

<p>
I liked "The Matrix", the idea of people as batteries was
laughable, but maybe a battery company paid big dollars. Using the
people as some sort of processor would have made more sense, they
could even claim to be using the urban mythable 90% of the brain we
supposedly don't use.

<p>
One of my favorite parts was when the heroine was staring at the
helicopter, and Neo ask's her "can you fly that thing". "Not yet"
she answers reaching for her cellphone......
