<a name="1936qlink1"><a href="1931.html#1935qlink1">&gt; &gt; &gt; THAT would be your answer to the parents?????  "Suck it up, </a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; folks; no need to be irrationally emotional about this li'l ole </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; aberration.  It's only your kids lying dead in there."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Am I supposed to feel like an evil human being because I put</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more faith in black-and-white numbers from a responsible study</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; than in the lament of some sobbing mother?  Well, then, I'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; just have to accept that.  My children will have to live with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the consequences of what I do, not with how I feel.  Sorrow</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; won't accomplish anything.  If that makes me inhuman, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that's one more reason to desire to become transhuman--perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a better-designed being won't be so distracted by emotional</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reactions from making the right choices.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Wow, some actual transhuman/extropian content on this thread!</i><br>
 
<p>
<a href="1931.html#1935qlink2">&gt; Your response may be clinically described as sociopathic, for it </a><br>
<i>&gt; makes no distinction between people and things.</a></i><br>

<p>
When I earlier said that one of your responses showed either a
lack of reading comprehension or dishonesty, I guessed the latter.
I now see that it is both.  In what possible stretch of the
English language can you interpret these words as anything of
the sort?  Where have I ever said or even implied that I do not
feel special reverence for sentient beings, or that I do not
suffer from their loss?  If you read my actual words as I wrote
them and not the imaginary meaning your mind is putting into them,
you'd see that I not only treasure humans but human feelings as
well; I just refuse to base decisions on those feelings instead
of reason.  If you believe feelings are not just a wonderful part
of being human, but also a useful guide to decision-making in
their own right, well, I have no respect for that belief, and
we'll have to leave it at that.
