I'm not sure your are correct. True, the sect(?) started in the U.S., and
religion is highly correlated with family, but there are still a bunch of
non-white adventists.</a> My dad was stationed in Fiji during and after world

even though this was the Christian Sabbath, because the (Fijian) Adventists
treated it as an ordinary workday.
