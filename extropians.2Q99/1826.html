<p>
What is your definition of "perfect"?  Evolutionary forms
(mutation/selection), such as free market capitalism, are pretty much ideal
when working with any system where transaction costs are greater than zero.
 I might add, though, that free market capitalism is not practiced anywhere
in the world today and that most of the ills of capitalism directly or
indirectly result from the fact that it is not a free market.

<p>
The problem is that all the other economic systems are "doomed to failure"
as well.  The real benefit of free market capitalism is that it allows you,
the individual, to minimize your failure rate, whereas most other economic
systems set that rate for you to some extent.  You have a vested interest
in setting your own failure rate; delegating that ability runs a far higher
risk of a net loss than taking responsibility, particularly since the
people to whom the responsibility is delegated are trying to minimize
*their* failure rate as well, even if at the expense of yours.

<p>
The principle of Self Determination allows everyone to set their own rate
of failure, and I believe that given the freedom to set my own failure
rate, that I can minimize my failure to the maximum extent possible.  You
can never win, but you can cheat the odds for a really long time -- entropy
in a nutshell.
