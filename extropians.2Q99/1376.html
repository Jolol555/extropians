I should amend my earlier statement. Not only has Homo sapiens begun the
process of global suicide (he didn't actually "decide" to do it -- he just
doesn't comprehend the consequence of his instinctually-driven ideology), he
has also begun the process of collective denial combined with a
determination to keep up appearances. Ubiquitious self-medication and drug
abuse in the West constitutes one symptom of this collective malady. In the
words of an earlier contributor to this list, "Anaesthetic offenses numb the
best defenses."
