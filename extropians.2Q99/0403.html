<p>
I just recently spent a few hours with my Dad (retired) at a lake in texas.  
He had his travel trailer and I drove up in my semi.

<p>
It's a pretty nice Travel Trailer.  A pretty much self contained 27 ft. fifth 
wheel that he pulls with a 3/4 ton pickup. It's complete with cooking and 
bathing facilities.

<p>
Which got me to wondering as I drove along afterwards.

<p>
<a name="0430qlink1"><a name="0411qlink1"><a name="0410qlink1">Is it possible to build a small, inexpensive solar powered electrolysis</a> unit 
tht would take water (say...from his holding tank) split the water into H2 
and O....and store the H2 for use as a cooking gas in his stove, to run his 
refrigerator...and as fuel for his heater.</a>

<p>
<a name="0430qlink2">Could such a unit be built inexpensively enough such that it would make sense 
to purchase it as opposed to the propane which he currently uses...(a little 
over a dollar a gallon....dual  seven gallon tanks being good for not quiet a 
</a>month....)

<p>
<a name="0430qlink3"><a name="0421qlink1"><a name="0410qlink2">Hmmmmm....now if THAT is possible...what about a Hydrogen fueled..fuel cell 
</a>
powered semi?</a>
