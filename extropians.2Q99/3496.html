  <li>  They won't get a majority.  They barely have a presence in
parliament. I think they have 2 or 3 seats.

<p>
So why do you  guys froth on so much about self defense and this
"preserving liberty" bullshit? If it's a sport thing, then sure, I think
guns in and of themselves are great.

<p>
But when it comes to perforating the public, well, no, I think that is
bad.

<p>
If "most guns used for target shooting or (in America) hunting?", then
why has this come up in a thread about guns-as-lethal-offensive-weapons?


<p>
Hmmm?

<p>
You guys just keep grasping at those straws...
