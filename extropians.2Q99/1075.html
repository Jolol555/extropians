<a href="1069.html#1075qlink1">&gt;&gt;I see two big issues that are being overlooked here:</a><br>
<i>&gt;1) Space junk is only a medium-size problem.  It certainly isn't </i><br>
worthwhile to launch a major space program just to corral the stuff.  
Schemes like robotic junk-retrieval tugs will end up costing tens of 
millions of dollars per object retrieved, and there are tens of 
thousands of relatively significant objects up there.  That adds up 
to an awful lot of zeros.</a>

Space junk passes within 1 1/2 miles of ozone-mapping</a> satellite ^By

<a name="1081qlink3">DUNN ^AP Aerospace Writer CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - An ozone-
measuring
<br>
satellite trailing space shuttle Discovery came frighteningly close 
to a
<br>
500-pound piece of space junk that could have smashed it to pieces. 
</a>
The
<br>
discarded rocket motor passed within 1 1/2 miles of the German-built
satellite, worth tens of millions of dollars. Discovery and its crew 
of six
<br>
were 51 miles ahead of the satellite at the time Monday night and 
were in
<br>
no danger, German mission manager Konrad Moritz said. If the rocket 
motor
<br>
and the 7,700-pound satellite had collided - both are hurtling around 
Earth
<br>
at 17,500 mph - it could have been disastrous. The U.S. Space Command,
which tracks junk in orbit, knew the object was out there and kept 
NASA
<br>
informed. However, as the piece drew near, engineers variously 
predicted it
<br>
would pass as close as a half-mile or 3 1/2 miles. Because of that 
wide
<br>
margin of uncertainty, scientists nervously watched computer screens 
when
<br>
the moment of closest approach came. ``We saw that we are still
transmitting, so our spacecraft is fine,'' Moritz said. ``This was a 
moment
<br>
of excitement.'' Ground controllers were prepared to fire tiny 
thrusters on
<br>
the satellite to slowly maneuver it out of harm's way. There is no 
danger
<br>
of the motor coming close to the 184-mile-high satellite again, said 
NASA
<br>
spokesman Kyle Herring. The astronauts plan to retrieve the satellite 
on
<br>
Saturday, two days before their mission ends. The spent rocket motor 
was
<br>
used in the unsuccessful launch of a communications satellite that was
carried up on a space shuttle in 1984. Coincidentally, the platform on
which the satellite's ozone-mapping telescopes are flying was on that
mission, too. ``Now we are meeting this guy again,'' Moritz said. 
``Isn't
<br>
that the story?'' The rocket motor is among more than 8,500 orbiting
objects being tracked by the U.S. Space Command, most of them junk.
Discovery's crew spent Tuesday taking more pictures of the Hale-Bopp 
comet
<br>
with an ultraviolet telescope mounted on a shuttle window, and 
conducted
<br>
more tests with a laboratory platform designed to withstand 
vibrations from
<br>
the spacecraft. ^AP-ES-08-12-97 1845EDT
