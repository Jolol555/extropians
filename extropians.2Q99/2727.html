Listen, I just have to step in here. The word "negroes" is also often 
considered offensive, so be careful - you might want to practise what you 
preach. And I also think that a serious gaff was made, using the term "abo" 
and racism abounds here (as it does in most so-called polite societies). I 
believe it was inadvertant, which does not excuse it, BTW. You called 
bullshit on it, and he replied, stating his own ethnicity. I have called 
bullshit on so much racism and sexism on this list I can't even remember it 
all. I've even gone  far as to yell "redneck" at people on this list. White 
is as white does, etc.</a>

However. The Scots history is far more closely comparable with the Native 
Amercian than the African American. They had chiefs, they had clans, they had 
tribes, all of which the British tried to stamp out. They were forbidden to 
dress in their own way and forbidden to speak their own tongue. They were 
dealt with very much like the First Nations here in the US.  Sure they are 
white, and that somehow makes it seem less aggregious to many, for what 
follows is a more efficacious "integration" into European society. If you are 
brown you can't be as easily "assimilated". 
Oh.... and yes, Scots were locked in chains and carried off - to America. It 
was called the great deportation. It is a sad story. It is why so many white, 
as well as Native American people have Scottish ancestors.
