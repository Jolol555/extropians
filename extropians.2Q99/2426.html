<p>
On a list the general result of "good men and women" doing something
about this is a flamewar.  Also, out of context, it has several different
meanings - it could also point out that even admired people can hold
offensive views, or point out how far we've gone since 1858.  In a sig,
it's out of context.

<p>
A better response might be to interpret the response in the more 
reasonable ways and open a discussion on what things helped people
dump such silly views.  Was is the recognition of extensive interbreeding
between whites and blacks in America, to the point that pure Africans
are a minority of blacks and whites of unsuspected African heritage
not particularly rare?  Was it the superb service records of blacks in
the American military?  Was it the fact that one of the greatest 
thinkers and leaders of non-violent protest of all time was black?
Was it the scientific discovery that race in humans is only skin deep, 
with few affects other than the obvious physical ones?

<p>
I'd be interested to hear some other ideas.
