<a name="1680qlink1">Well, I suppose neutronium is *okay*, if you're not worried about
*efficiency* or anything...but Real Powers Use Monopolium.  Not
neutronium.  Not Higgsinium.<a name="1643qlink1">  Raw, incredibly dense monopoles.</a>
</a>

<p>
This is the story of Mel... no, just kidding.  Anyway, my handy-dandy
reference, "Harvard Doesn't Publish Science Fiction" by Moravec in _New
Destinies III_ (it should be called _New Densities_, ha ha), says that
Higgsinium (formed of pseudo-iron atoms with a nucleus of 26 negative
Higgsinos and 26 protons orbiting the nucleus) is 10^18 times as dense
as water.  Monopolium, formed of magnetic monopoles bound by their
opposite polarities instead of electrical charges, is 10^25 times as
dense as water - a thimbleful weighs as much as the Moon.  Switching
speeds increase accordingly.

<p>
Don't tell *me* about Moore's Law running out of room.

<p>
<a name="1680qlink2">Thus an actual Jupiter Brain, formed of Jupiter, would probably be just
around a meter wide (?).  You can't have a Brain that's actually the
size of Jupiter because it would collapse and form a black hole, not to
mention that there isn't that much mass in the whole solar system or
possibly the galaxy.</a>

<p>
<a name="1680qlink3">Questions for Thought and Study:


</a>
<OL>
  <li>  What is the maximum size/mass of a JB constructed of monopolium?
<a name="1680qlink4">  <li>  How much computing power would it have?</a>
<a name="1680qlink5">  <li>  How much time would a unified thought take to cross the JB?</a>
<a name="1680qlink6">  <li>  How does a JB's reaction time and flops/thought compare with a human?</a>
<a name="1680qlink7">  <li>  How does strange matter compare to Monopolium?</a>
<a name="1680qlink8">  <li>  Adjust your results for relativistic slowdown due to the JB's mass.</a>
<a name="1680qlink9">  <li>  Calculate whether monopolium has a Chandrasekhar limit.  Does this
change the maximum?</a>
<a name="1680qlink10">  <li>  How would you detect a JB using SETI?</a>
<a name="1680qlink11">  <li>  How much energy does a JB dissipate while performing computations?</a>
<a name="1680qlink12">  <li>  What is the maximum non-hole-forming density of JBs as a function
of population?</a>
  <li>  At the population equalling a galactic mass, what is the time for
thoughts to cross?
<a name="1680qlink13">  <li>  How does the ratio compare to human thoughts vs. human speech?</a>
  <li>  What are the orbital speeds necessary to prevent a collapse to the center?
  <li>  How fast does a JB society circulate?
  <li>  How long does it take for a thought to permeate society?


</OL>
<p>
According to these assumptions, far from being mutually telepathic, the
<a name="1654qlink1">future may be filled with individuals far more alone than we ever were. 
I happen to think that Real Powers Use Alpha Points,</a> but if anyone did
the calculations above, it would probably make a nice article somewhere.
 Alas, I lack the physics, since a mortal has to draw the line somewhere...
