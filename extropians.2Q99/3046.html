<a name="3152qlink1">Just remember, stress kills. Better I think to distance yourself
from anger, and substitute a good sense of perspective. It is
quite possible to get the salesclerk off the phone without
getting angry at all. I can't remember the last time I got
really pulsatingly mad... it just isn't worth the trouble.</a>

<i>&gt; &gt; Instead of focusing on guns, bows and arrows, or mud sticks (any one read</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; R.A.W.'s Schoedinger's Cat:  about Alpha Males need to fling poop?), I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; curious what kinds of anger management transhumans would implement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Anyone half trained in logic can see that:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Our human race learning to deal with it's own anger and rage could have saved</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more lives than banning guns. The Emotional IQ of people who shoot each other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is far more intersting to me than how many of them do it, or which ones were</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "right". Emotions here on the list in fact are of great interest to me. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anger and aggresion mounts daily!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anger has many meanings.  In speaking of "counting to 10" and mediation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you seem to be looking at the relatively short-lived emotional response:</i><br>
<i>&gt; the flaring nostrils, rush of adrenalin, heavy breathing, blind sense</i><br>
<i>&gt; of rage which occasionally we all feel.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You are no doubt right that much violence occurs in the throes of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind of short lived anger.  But I would guess that most violent attacks</i><br>
<i>&gt; and deaths do not occur in such a state.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First, you have the entire area of deaths by warfare and genocide.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In this century alone we have seen Hitler's holocaust, Stalin's purges,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the killing fields of Cambodia, and many other instances of mass murder.</i><br>
<i>&gt; These number in the tens of millions and surely far outnumber individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; murders.  Most of the people involved were not commiting these acts in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a burst of passionate anger.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even among murders and attacks, only a fraction occur in the throes of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; outburst of temper such as you are describing as anger.  Others are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; result of long-simmering resentments, or even cold blooded calculation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of advantage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And anger is not always bad.  Meek and mild people are often taken</i><br>
<i>&gt; advantage of.  The angry person speaks up and complains to the management.</i><br>
<i>&gt; She makes the sales clerk deal with the customers in line rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; answering the phone.  He forces his associate to follow through on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; business commitment rather than backing off when difficulties arise.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anger has arisen and been maintained through evolution because it</i><br>
<i>&gt; serves a purpose.  Anger can give people strength and courage to break</i><br>
<i>&gt; through social and natural barriers that they could not normally manage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anger blinds us, yes; but sometimes we have needed to be blinded, so that</i><br>
<i>&gt; our actions are not constrained and we can act with necessary intensity</i><br>
<i>&gt; and speed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, ultimately, all of our emotions, anger, love, fear, hope, are</i><br>
<i>&gt; a rather crude form of motivation and guidance.  If we didn't have fear</i><br>
<i>&gt; or love, we might not need anger.  Perhaps as transhumans we will be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to substitute rationality for all our emotions.  We will be the Vulcans</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Star Trek, always logical and rational.  Does this sound desirable?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or, as long as we're fantasizing, let's pretend that we can only get</i><br>
<i>&gt; rid of the "bad" emotions and keep the "good" ones.  We'll keep love</i><br>
<i>&gt; and discard hate, keep happiness and discard sadness.  We'll become</i><br>
<i>&gt; Teletubbies.  What a marvelous future this will be.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am torn between the desire to control my emotions, and the desire</i><br>
<i>&gt; to feel my emotions.  Should I fight anger, or should I glory in it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Philosophers have different views on this.  Some say we are alienated from</i><br>
<i>&gt; our emotions and need to stop trying to suppress and control our deeper</i><br>
<i>&gt; selves.  Others advocate a path of calmness and serenity, without strife</i><br>
<i>&gt; or, for that matter, striving.  No one answer is fully satisfying to me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
