<p>
Force delivered should match the threat presented. If the intruder halts
when accosted, that should be the limit of force used. If the intruder
persists in advancing, escalation in force is justified until the threat is
neutralized. If this requires the death of the intruder, it is the intruder
who pressed the matter. The homeowner is completely in the right in
presenting ANY level of force necessary to halt the intrusion.

<p>
We must trust the person confronted with a threat to use their own
judgement to counter it. If some people consistently overuse force, they
will be found and society can deal with them as needed. The great majority
of individuals are responsible enough to be trusted with decisions as to
their own defense. Indeed, unless the ideal police state is created, there
is NO OTHER CHOICE, as the existing police forces normally cannot react to
threats to a person until after the fact.

<p>
In any case, this will be my last post on the matter to the list. If anyone
