<p>
Actually, MAPS did not conduct the study, but rather sponsored it (along
with CaNORML).

<p>
The commentary on said study has been almost uniformly negative, with many
individuals, including active researchers in the fields of pharmaceutical
science and biochemistry, questioning the rigor and accuracy of the
protocols used. In addition, the lab conducting the study did not conduct
additional analyses, specified in their contract, into the effectiveness of
water pipes and vaporizers in filtering harmful gases from cannabis smoke.
The lab informed MAPS that technical difficulties prevented it from
conducting the gas analysis portion of the study.

<p>
Overall, I must say that although I admire MAPS' honesty in making the
results of this study public, I have to question their choice of research
facility and I do not rate this study highly among those conducted on the
topic. This one study is in conflict with a significant number of studies
which indicate that "bongs" - water pipes - filter little or none of the
THC from cannabis smoke, and are very effective in removing many of the
most harmful constituents.

<p>
The book _Marijuana Chemistry_ by Michael Starks, has some decent basic
coverage on the topic of the soluability of cannibinol isomers. Also, for a
recent overview of work on this topic, I would refer interested readers to:

Literature Review, MAPS Newsletter, Vol. IV #2, 1993].

Fwiw, this extropy-minded individual, were he to do something so rash as to
inhale the smoke of this government-scheduled substance, would make an
effort to do so using a water-filtered pipe.
