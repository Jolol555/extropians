<a name="4511qlink1">Baseball teaches you that if you are a klutz, that you are a thorn in
everyone else's side.  And most games are organized by adult coaches, with
the kids basically doing what they are told to do, instead of experimenting
on their own.</a>

group effort that allowed everybody to contribute their own unique talents
