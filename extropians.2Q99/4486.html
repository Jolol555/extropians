This reminds me of a _Scientific American_ article that I read, maybe
five or so years ago, where the author (it was physicist David Deutsch,
IIRC), was diagramming how time travel would work, assuming the quantum
Many Worlds idea is correct. Apparently Deutch's book _The Fabric of
Reality_ talks about this, the web site promoting the book is at
<a href="http://www.qubit.org/people/david/FabricOfReality/FoR.html">http://www.qubit.org/people/david/FabricOfReality/FoR.html</a> . A relevant
quote from Deutch can be found in Bryce DeWitt's review at the site,
Deutch says "Time travel may be achieved one day, or it may not. But if
it is, it should not require any fundamental change in world-view, at
least for those who broadly share the world view I am presenting in this
book". So it sounds as though some interesting or consistent development
of the closed time loop idea may be possible, basically along the lines
of the kind of sf story where you get access to alternate time lines!

<p>
Notice that even if this radical idea should happen to work out for
real, it doesn't remove the need for causality as such. For instance,
the whole point of getting multiple timelines involved in this is to
open up the "closed" time loops, so that the causal effects extend
forward into another history, instead of actually going around in
circles. Anyway, it's certainly difficult to say for sure what these
strange GR "time warpy" ideas might come to! For instance, maybe someone
could use time loops to arrange for some reliable system of FTL
transfer, with all the protocols needed for dealing with the
complication that you don't always arrive in your own historical
universe? OTOH, maybe sheer biased conservatism will turn out to be
correct, and the time travel/FTL thing will never happen, perhaps due to
the special energy densities required being strictly impossible, in the
end?
