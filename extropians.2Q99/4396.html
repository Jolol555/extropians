I've written two short essays on this topic recently, see
<a href="http://www.chrismaloney.com/seed/seed1.html#identity">http://www.chrismaloney.com/seed/seed1.html#identity</a> and
<a href="http://www.chrismaloney.com/seed/seed2.html#indeterminacy">http://www.chrismaloney.com/seed/seed2.html#indeterminacy</a>.
<a name="4402qlink1">In short, my view is that at every moment in time, our 
next moment is selected at random from the ensemble of all
existing closest continuations.  Max More has written about
this in his dissertation, and I wrote him some emails 
trying to discuss it with him, but got no reply.</a>

<p>
<a name="4402qlink3"><a name="4402qlink2">Anyway, the result is this: uploading does provide a path
for continuing our conscious selves.  If the human is 
dissected and destroyed at the same time as being uploaded,
then the consciousness will</a> be transfered.  But if not,
then you will have two living human beings in the next
</a>instant.  They will only be identical at one instant, then
they immediately begin to diverge.  Even if the uploaded
copy were to have someone program the exact same experiences
as the flesh copy was having, they would diverge.  This is
true because of the combined effect of quantum indeterminacy
and classical chaos.  

<p>
<a name="4402qlink4">So if the original were not destroyed instantly, there would
exist two humans, who each wanted to survive.
