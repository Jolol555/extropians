Lazarus Long did not 'breed' with any of his ancestors - only with some of
his sibling's generation. Did I miss something in reading these stories?
Without re-reading, I am not sure he actually impregnated anyone while back
in time - or did he knock up his older sister? I need to read the whole
series again - it's getting to be that time.

His liason with his mother on his return to his childhood era was while she
was safely pregnant with her husband's child.
