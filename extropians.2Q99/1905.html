...and a rocket plumber is a self-deprecating propulsion engineer. 
In many ways, a rocket combustor is a glorified shower head.  Of
course shower heads don't melt down if you make a mistake turning
the valves...

Hey, I've been shot at and missed, shat at and hit (the joys of
infants and parenthood), been blown up, burned, and broken my back
(twice).  Flying on a rocket should be right up my alley... and I am
signing up with Alcor, I just have to get one set of papers
<a name="1914qlink1">notarized and I'm set. Folks at the office were joking about getting
me a special spacesuit with a built-in guillotine and a liquid
nitrogen bottle.  Nice to know they care...</a>
