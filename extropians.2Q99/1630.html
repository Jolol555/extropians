A question for all of you, but especially David, since he seems to have worked
at improving his senses.

mental, sensory, or physical abilities with currently available techniques.

<p>
Coming from a family legacy of poor interpersonal skills, I have made a special
effort over the last 20 years to improve mine.  It has required more attention
than time, and has paid off enormously, both in terms of my professional and
personal success.

<p>
Aerobic and weight training is another clear payoff.  Better sleep, fewer 
headaches, longer life, more energy, more strength, more stamina.

<p>
Nootropics just require money and remembering to take pills.

<p>
I haven't heard of much else that will improve my underlying abilities or quality 
of life in a way I care enough to try.  (Steve Mann's cyborg life is fascinating
but I'm not ready.)  What can people vouch for?
