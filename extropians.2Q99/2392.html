This is a tough problem, one which is nearly identical to a previous
experience on this list.  We could cut and paste a three week section
of the archives from last fall, and no one would notice.

<p>
Elizabeth's party analogy is good in that the amount of time I have to
read extropians varies daily.  Some days I need to delete everything
unread, other days I have time to read even some of the gun rants.  {8^D

<p>
I wish I knew why that particular subject (guns) nukes this particular list.
The best I can suggest is to repeatedly ask politely, everyone use
subject line discipline, *especially* when talking about tired old
topics.  And, newbies, take a few hours to peruse the archives.

<p>
Question: does it cost the extropy.org money to handle the heavy
message load when the gun virus hits?  Is it charged per message?  spike
