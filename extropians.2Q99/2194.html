<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I propose a test to determine whether rational debate is possible for this topic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; on this list, in the form of two questions.  (1) If there existed a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; preponderance of evidence showing that violence does in fact _decrease_ when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; guns are readily available, would the anti-gun forces actually change their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; stripes?  (2) If there existed a preponderance of evidence showing that violence</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; does in fact _increase_ when guns are readily available, would the pro-gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; forces renounce their faith in the proliferation of the weapons?  If the answer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; to either question is "no" (as I rather suspect it is) then rational debate is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; impossible and no one will allow themselves to become susceptible to whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; evidence or argument the "other side" may offer.  A counter-productive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; enterprise to say the least (though perhaps illuminating to any who do not feel</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; knowlegdeable enough to take a position).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is too simplistic. Readily available to who? Even if guns are outlawed here</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; today, the criminals will still have ready access to guns to their hearts desire,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; there are so many squirreled away. Given this, and since it has already been</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; conclusively proven that crime does in fact go down when guns are readily available</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and can be carried concealed by law abiding citizens, then I can say, ok. A telling</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fact is that Prof. John Lott's original study was done under the employ of Handgun</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Control Inc, until his results showed the opposite of what HCI wanted him to prove.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; HCI took him to court to prevent him from attaching their name in any way to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; study, and despite the fact that his study covers the largest sample of crime data</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in history (all FBI crime stats from 1979 to 1995), the gun crime researchers who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are invested in the gun control cause insist on calling his study 'flawed'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; OK, by "readily available" I meant legalized concealed carry.  Available to law-abiding</i><br>
<i>&gt; citizens.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I also found it significant that Lott began the study expecting to validate the</i><br>
<i>&gt; gan-banners' preconceptions, but had the intellectual honesty to believe what the data</i><br>
<i>&gt; told him.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am curious to know if anyone can present evidence (not flaming rhetoric) that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; suggests the opposite conclusion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They can't which is why they get into their hysterical spitting moods...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My main point was to find out if anyone is even interested in evidence here.  So far</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've seen evidence backing the increased benefits to society of gun ownership, but none</i><br>
<i>&gt; for gun banning.  No one has officially asked (on this list anyway) if someone knows of</i><br>
<i>&gt; such evidence, so I thought I'd step forward.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

Well, now such evidence has been posted, and since you don't like 
its conclusions, you'll do your dead-level best to ignore or impeach 
it.
