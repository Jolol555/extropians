OK, now I understand how I could have made it cleared up front
what I had in mind.  My minimalist approach, with the single tiny
woman and the dewar of embryos assumes no other humans cross
the interplanetary gulf, at least not until we have nanotech and/or
biosuspension (which would make the whole task much easier).

<p>
<a name="0049qlink1">The minimalist approach requires no technology that we dont already
have.  The lander module I have in mind would be very small, too
small in fact for...us.  It would be just sufficient to sustain a little bit
of human life, until the machines could build farm and hab modules
for the generations that would follow, all born right there on the red planet.

<p>
Now, even that approach would require some cutting edge engineering:
software for the machines so that they could operate semi-autonomously,
for instance.  The sole advantage to the minimalist approach is cost.
But the sacrifice required on the part of the colonist is profound, I
must admit.</a>

<a name="0049qlink2">For a while I toyed with the idea of offering the job to a condemned
criminal who would otherwise be executed.  However, I realized this
approach would not work: there are not many women who are on
death row, and I doubt a suitable candidate could be found among
that limited pool.  I do not wish to restart the capital punishment virus
here.  Please.

<p>
So again, I am back to: how small could the mission be scaled?  spike
