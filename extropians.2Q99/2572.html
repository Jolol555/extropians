OK so far, but Ethernet capacity is not a scalar. In fact, a Beowulf's
connectivity (network topology) can be good for some problems and
bad for others. I think you need to rate the capacity with respect to
each problem you intend to attempt. For CPU-intensive problems with minimal
comms requirements, a COW (collection of workstations) or even a distributed.net
can be very effective. For cellular automata simulations, a four-way grid
net of FDX 100BaseT will likely beat a hierarchical Gigabit net. I'm
currently putting together a dual 450Mhz Celeron Linux machine (cheap and fast)
and a friend currently has it connected to a similar machine with 2 100BaseT
FDX links. He's going to try beowulf povray. We want to try Mosix, but
Mosix and SMP don't quite play together yet. 

<p>
For those extropians who may be confused, Beowulf is software that allows
anyone to build a supercomputer cheaply by connecting essentially any number
of cheap computers. You can build a dual-processor Celeron system for about
$500. Sixteen such systems give you a 32-processor beowulf for &lt;$8000.
If you believe that progress is constrained at least somewhat by lack of
supercomputer availability, you will see Beowulf as another step toward a
computer-enhanced future. Mosix is less well-known. It permits a collection
of computers to share an arbitrary load of "normal" programs, while beowulf
permits the collection to run a program that has been written for beowulf.
