<p>
The offending passage of mine appears to be the following:
<br>
<i>&gt; Maybe you should - although I hope you'd do</i><br>
<i>&gt; a better job of it than he did.  Mr. Burkhead seems to be</i><br>
&gt; fond of making sweeping statements about what is possible<br>
&gt; in fields he obviously doesn't know anything about.<br>

<p>
Which was made in reference to Mr. Burkhead's web site,
<a href="http://www.geniebusters.org/">http://www.geniebusters.org/</a>, which is devoted to debunking various
nanotranscendance memes.  While my statement was perhaps a bit sharp, it is
mild compared to those Mr. Burkhead makes on his site.  It is also accurate,
IMO, at least with regards to his ideas about artificial intelligence.  I
<a name="0308qlink1">refer interested readers to parts 15-21 of Geniebusters, where Mr. Burkhead
argues without evidence that no possible AI system can ever result in
dramatic cost savings for any kind of organization.  His arguments may sound
reasonable to a non-specialist, but if you actually know something about AI
</a>
(or even programming in general) they make no sense at all.

<p>
<a name="0308qlink2">Now, Mr. Burkhead, if you are actually interested in discussing the issue I
will be happy to do so.  If, instead, you prefer to devote your time to
</a>
other activities, then that is certainly your prerogative.  However, sniping
at me in other threads while ignoring the actual issues is not a productive
response.
