Theta 8008  noted

<a href="2841.html#2859qlink1">&gt; I have read various articles about intelligence which favor genetics</a><br>
<i>&gt; and others which favor environment as the larger cause for whether a person</i><br>
<i>&gt; is intelligent or creative or not. Personally, I think that as long as</i><br>
<i>&gt; genetics has provided you with a working brain, that the rest is pretty much</i><br>
<i>&gt; up to you. A favorable, stimulating environment helps, but the lack of such</i><br>
<i>&gt; can be made up for.</i><br>

<p>
That is actually one of the most fascinating research findings of the 90s.
you are right and that makes you wrong ;-)

<p>
<a name="2914qlink1">The early environmental deficit appears to be ameliorated with time and
exposure to more environment.</a> Paradoxically, this leads to an increase in
heritability among adults (where h^2 is around 80%) over children, in whom
the narrow heritability of IQ scores is just under 50%.
So ... we do make up for our environment, which means that we end up
different in ways specified by our genes.
