<i>&gt; As opposed to gun owners being stigmatized?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
It is not an either/or.  In fact, the legal possession of firearms would 
once again become a matter of personal pride, for it would be prima 
facie evidence of adulthood, nonaggrsesion and sanity.

I thought that you were eliding your true feelings on the issue when 
you denied believing in universal mandatory gun ownership.  BTW, 
the Constitution says people should have the right to keep and 
bear since a well-regulated militia is necessary; not that 
membership in it is mandated for every citizen.  The people I want 
to see on a purchase-prohibited registry are not people I'd like to 
have at my shoulder when things got busy, nor would any 
professional soldier want to serve with them.

<i>&gt; to be a citizen, you did it, didn't you? You didn't run off to Canada,</i><br>

<i>&gt; have the desire and the guts to be a CO, you picked up a rifle and did</i><br>
<i>&gt; your dirty work just like everyone else. You risked getting killed or</i><br>

<i>&gt; to the core of my being that we will only remain the nation we are so</i><br>
<i>&gt; long as all give something of themselves to their country, and follow</i><br>
<i>&gt; the old Roman Republic maxim of "come home with your shield or on it, or</i><br>

<a name="3182qlink5"><a href="3120.html#3138qlink5">&gt; The only measures I support are already in place, and have passed</a><br>
<i>&gt; constitutional muster. Those statutes that don't should no longer be</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered by rational Americans.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
The measures I have profferred are logical, rational, reasonable, 
specifically targeted and limited in scope and range.  You may not 
LIKE the fact that they make eminent sense, as this fact grates 
against your own irrational quasireligious prejudices, but yet they 
do to many rational people, here on this very list and elsewhere.

<a name="3182qlink6">You have, at least, come clean and admitted that you oppose 
denying children, violent criminals and the mentally incompetent 
free and unfettered access to the means to efficiently commit longrange
 mass homicide, because that is what you just UNDENIABLY 
said.  You can no longer avoid the label of absolutist extremist, for 
</a>
you just superglued it on yourself.  Your banner has become your 
petard, and you are irretrievablyhoisted upon it.

<a name="3182qlink7"><i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The concern about proper training is a valid</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one that even the founding fathers recognised, which is why</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the term "well</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regulated" is in the 2nd amendment, which in that day and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; age meant well trained</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and skilled. Its IMHO everyone's constitutional DUTY to learn</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to responsibly use</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weapons because of this, unless they have a religious type</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of reticence against</i><br>
