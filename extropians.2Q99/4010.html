<p>
If a poster wants to provide some value to the list in forwarding
news items, they should take some time to explain why the news
is important to extropian concerns, point out potential problems
with the news, and draw potential connections to other recent
(or not so recent) happenings.  The best semi-regular example of
this would be Anders' occasional summaries of interesting things
he has read in journals.

<p>
Whether it is posting news or engaging in debate, I don't see
how anyone could have time to make more than three well thought
out posts a day.

<p>
Each post will be considered by several hundred people for anywhere
from a split second (to delete on sight) to several minutes.  By
putting some of their own time into making quality posts, posters
show respect other subscribers' time.

<p>
I support a three post/day/subscriber limit.  I do not support a
5k/post limit, as sometimes a well thought out post requires more
than 5k.
