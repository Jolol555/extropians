How about an Extropian FAQ that gets posted to the list at least once a
month.  From reading many of the more controversial postings lately, I
get the idea that some posters haven't a clue about the Extropian
Principles or even what separates us from other transhumans.  

<p>
The FAQ could list the principles, give guidelines for postings (using
keywords, etc.),  and provide other information that newbies to the
list could have read at the site's homepage, but are too lazy to do so.
 It would also give the casual observer more opportunities to have
insight as to what we're all about.

<p>
One of the problems that I see with moderating a list like ours is the
fact that we're all (mostly) a bunch of libertarians (not necessarily
members of any party, though) and we're all (mostly) fairly
intelligent.  Organizing intelligent libertarians is a night-mare in
the  best of times. 

<p>
I suggest that we look to Virginia Postrel's "Rules" for a dynamic
society and try to implement some of those.   I follow this post up
with some of her suggestion and  everyone can see what we feel about
it...
