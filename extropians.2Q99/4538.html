<a href="4516.html#4538qlink1">&gt;the response from an Aussie medico. ...</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;... my claim that medicine has a low marginal value.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The clearest evidence we have on this is the RAND Health Insurance</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Experiment [Newhouse et al, "Free for All?" '93] ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the comparisons are between groups who have different levels of</i><br>
<i>&gt;insurance. ... you wouldn't expect much difference in health</i><br>
<i>&gt;outcomes because they are, for all intents and purposes, indistinguishable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;No-one is going to miss out on life-saving surgery. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;The paper doesn't test the "effectiveness of medicine",</i><br>
<i>&gt;because it's not comparing a group who receive medical care with a group</i><br>
<i>&gt;who don't receive medical care (an experiment that I doubt will ever be</i><br>
<i>&gt;performed). The paper doesn't actually test the "marginal effectiveness of</i><br>
<i>&gt;medicine" so much as it tests the cost-benefits of different insurance</i><br>
<i>&gt;options. And, not surprisingly, it found that most health indicators are</i><br>
<i>&gt;the comparable, but people who don't pay for their health care use more</i><br>
<i>&gt;services for very little benefit.</i><br>

<p>
"Ethical" reasons supposedly don't let us experimentally test the
difference between normal vs. no medicine.  So this is the best we have.
When you
<br>
make people pay for their medicine, they choose to take 25% less of it,
which makes almost no health difference.  That foregone medicine is what
I mean by "marginal".

<p>
The experiment showed that this foregone medicine is, by standard medical
measures of "appropriateness", just as appropriate as the other
non-marginal medicine.  If people are very good at knowing when a medical
problem is serious
<br>
enough that they aught to seek medical attention, the non-marginal medicine
might be much more valuable (even if it is just as "appropriate").  If,
however, people are very bad at knowing when a health problem is serious,
non-marginal medicine must be about as useless as marginal medicine.

<p>
<a href="4516.html#4538qlink2">&gt;... it's not true that there were "no significant"</a><br>
<i>&gt;differences between the groups. At least one paper I found on Medline tried</i><br>
<i>&gt;to explain why eyesight was reportedly significantly improved in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;high-insurance group.</i><br>

<p>
I did mention better eyesight and filled teeth in my summary.

<p>
<a href="4516.html#4538qlink3">&gt;The other paper mentioned must be a dud reference. The Lantz paper I picked</a><br>
<i>&gt;up in that issue of JAMA doesn't actually deal with the topic Hanson uses</i><br>
<i>&gt;it for. The paper tried to answer whether altering the health-risk</i><br>
<i>&gt;behaviour of lower socioeconomic groups would lead to a significant</i><br>
<i>&gt;improvement in health outcomes. ...</i><br>

<p>
That is the right paper.  What the authors intended it for is irrelevant
to my point.  I just wanted to point out there there are a number of
other factors which seem to have a roughly two orders of magnitude larger
influence on health than that found by medicine in the RAND study.  Yes,
that wasn't a controlled experiment, but we don't have controlled
experiments
<br>
for the big important factors, unfortunately ("ethics" again).
