<p>
Sue, it can carry it, but do we have the technology to lift such objects?
The quote I saw said that modern engineers could not transport such an
object, I'm assuming that means lift and move.</a>

<p>
I'm not saying you're wrong and super-alien-beings from the past tossed big
rocks around, it's just that I have heard all sorts of theories pro and
con, but when I have read or heard any comments from people who actually
*do* have a clue, namely civil and construction engineers, they say "hell
no we can't do that!"

<p>
There's a lot of  opinions thrown around in this area, not a lot of facts,
and most of the facts are dubious.



<p>
<a name="1216qlink2"><a href="1200.html#1212qlink2">&gt; BTW, what would the vested interests of the engineers have been?</a><br>

<p>
What makes you think they had one?</a>


<p>
<a href="1200.html#1212qlink3">&gt; A way</a><br>
<i>&gt; of avoiding having to move the stones?</i><br>

<p>
I would think that any engineer who tries to move part of the Great Pyramid
or the lower course of the Temple of Jupiter would be lynched, so, um, no,
I think they were just offering their professional opinion.  I'm sure any
engineer with a modicum of self-respect would not short-sell his profession
on TV or in the pages of a published journal.


<p>
<a name="1216qlink3"><a href="1200.html#1212qlink4">&gt; Maybe the claim is simply a misunderstanding: the engineer was</a><br>

<p>
Maybe we lack the technology to move 1,000 ton blocks of stone great
distances?</a>
