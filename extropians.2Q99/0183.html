There are lots of cases when people ask others to perform acts they
can, but don't want to, perform personally, for various reasons.
I can ask somebody to massage my feet or move my furniture to 
another location.  Such acts are perfectly legal if I perform them
myself, and highly objectionable if performed by somebody else
without my consent.  However, procedures of expressing consent in
all such cases are quite clear and commonly accepted.
The fact that identical procedures are not accepted in the case</a> of
suicide, only seems to indicate the unwillingness of the society to
apply normal logic to the touchy subject of suicide.
