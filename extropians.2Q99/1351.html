I'm all for trade too.  I will trade my refusal to inflict violence on
you regardless of whatever personal choices you make for your life in
exchange for your refusal to inflict violence on me for making whatever
personal choices I make for my life.  I think that is a good trade.  I
will trade my willingness to find cooperative resolutions to our
conflicting desires for your willingness to find cooperative resolutions
to our conflicting desires.  I think that sort of trade is in our mutual
interest.</a>

The first lesson of martial arts is diplomacy.  When others like you,
they are less likely to hurt you.
