And I'm planning to leave before it's even implemented.

Silly me.

By the way, anyone want to sponsor a gun delphi client server developer into
the UK (preferably London)? I'd be happy with C++, I'm also good with cruddy
MS, vb family of products, esp. Access (The VB family reminds me of that
weird inbred rural family on a particularly sick episode of the XFiles,
where the mother had no arms or legs and lived on a rolling trolley thing
under the bed). I've also got a legacy system or two under my belt
(dataflex? anyone?), and formal quals. I'm not too bright, but with a bit of
care, who knows? I might just be a slow developer (hah hah hah).

<p>
Prospective employers must be resigned to the fact that my wife and I will
become internationally famous recording stars in the middle of a
particularly critical project.

<p>
Just short messages of acceptance please, I don't want to overwhelm the mail
server.
