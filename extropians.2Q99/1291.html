<p>
Your analysis appears to match reality.

<p>
Any magnetic storage degrades with time _unless_ rewritten periodically,
e.g. every 5 years.  A magnetic tape will eventually wear out by this,
but the data could be copied to a fresh tape each time, ad nauseam.

<p>
I copied my old 9 track magtape data to ExaByte technology some time ago,
but the tape transport unfortunately could no longer read some of the tapes
due to magnetic degradation.  I understand there exist special methods
to read the data even after a normal tape transport will reject the tape,
but such methods cost much more to use, and unless the data loss would
mean a catastrophe, most would not consider those methods a viable solution.
_I_ sure did not.

<p>
My old Hollerith cards and paper tapes, however, show no degradation
whatsoever..
