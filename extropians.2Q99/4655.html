<a name="4660qlink1">Well, I don't like Clinton much either. My most terrifying visage of
Clinton is the scenes (I've seen 2 or 3 of them now) where Mr Bill is
sitting at a table, surrounded by somber-faced police officials in full
uniform, signing away yet another basic human freedom....</a>

<p>
<a name="4660qlink2">Nonetheless, I wonder what is our collective (oh-oh) responsibility for
this guy. When the US was bombing Serbia, they supposedly went to great
lengths to avoid civilian</a> casualities. But why? Isn't Milosevic their
leader? Don't the Serbian people bear some responsibility for putting
this guy in office?

<p>
<a name="4660qlink3">There was a Nightline show where Ted Koppel went to Belgrade and had a
little lunchtime chat with some Serbs. They claimed that the US was
deliberately</a> targetting civilians. Ted made the point that, if that were
the case, there would be hundreds of thousands of dead civilians. It was
almost enough to make me think that the US should do at least one B-52
bombing run over Belgrade civilian housing, so they could say, 'See,
this is what happens when we deliberately target civilians'. The US
didn't seem to have much qualms about bombing Germans and Japanese
civilians in WWII.
