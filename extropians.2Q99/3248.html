I'm retired now (founded hypermart.net), so my skills are already
in decay, but anyway:

<p>
I'd say that if all you know how to do is program, make sure
you branch out and learn to be a good sysadmin (run Linux
and FreeBSD) and network admin. If you want to make the
motherlode of cash, the only real way is to open your own
business or jump in with a startup. And since every business
in 5 years will be an Internet business (or it will be dead
or dying) in some respect, you want to know everything
required to start a net biz. Learn everything you can about
a major database system. Make sure you keep up with all
the major web standards.

<p>
Also make sure you are reading everything from Wired to
Red Herring to Fast Company to keep up with where things
are headed business-wise. You have to learn to look at
things from a biz perspective if you aren't already. Get
even more greedy. Dream bigger.
