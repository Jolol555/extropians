Hello.

<p>
<a name="4326qlink1">Since I sparked this latest thread, let me clarify something;  I was
asking for the personal experiences of individual list members &amp; their
first brushes with extropian/transhumanist ideas, not trying to make a
list of what historical figures should be considered proto extropian. To
better reflect this intention, I've adopted a new subject line (see
above).
</a>

<p>
With respect to gender bias in the list of extropian meme-vectors, I
suspect that the primarily male list is accounted for by the fact that
the main exposure is via science fiction;  until fairly recently, this
was almost exclusively a boys' club.<a name="4274qlink1">  If you were exposed to the meme 20
years, therefore, the vector was probably male.</a>
New cases of exposure are much more likely to have female vectors;  my
personal favorites:

<p>
Linda Nagata
<br>
Nancy Kress

<p>
In 10 years, were we to repeat this survey, I think these names (&amp; other
females) would  certainly appear as source of first exposure.
