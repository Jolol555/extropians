<p>
I live in a state that has no income or sales tax. Most of the state and
local revenue is from property taxes, so I think I can contribute on
both sides of this issue.

<p>
<a name="3795qlink2">The claim that governments create property value is mostly false.</a> The
only value they give to the land is the rate of scarcity they give to as
they make the original land grants, and the amount of market value they
depress the real value below due to excessive taxation (i.e. if the tax
is high, the ability to derive positive cash flow from the land is
reduced, so its market value is low), as well as services which the
government provides to landowners. Landowners add value to the land by
building and developing the land with their own capital. The idea that
you should be taxed repeatedly, every year, on property which you have
afixed capital into is a confiscatory one, unless the land owner is
receiving something for those property taxes.

<p>
Currently paid for by property taxes:
<br>
<a name="3795qlink3">Education (K-12 and some college support)
police departments
<br>
fire departments
<br>
zoning departments
<br>
maintenance of community property (mostly recreational or green belt)
some road</a> maintenance

<p>
<a name="3795qlink4">The largest use of these taxes is education. Should people who are
sterile or lifelong bacholors/bachelorettes be forced to pay for the
education of the fertile members of the community?</a> That is definitely
confiscatory. I do know that senior citizens can live in developments
which are specifically exempted from the education portion of the
property taxes for this reason. Shouldn't people who send their children
to private schools be exampted from these education taxes when they
never use those services? Thats definitely confiscatory.

<p>
<a name="3795qlink5">Police departments: That and fire departments are iffy. The idea that
you should pay higher insurance if you don't have such 'protection' is
dubious, since the risk of such in areas where there is no protection
tends to be lesser than in more developed communities...Also the idea
that you should submit to one monopoly service is also iffy.</a>

<p>
Zoning departments do protect existing land owners from the stupid
actions of their neighbors, so in that sense 'establish' property value
by protecting the devaluation of a property from the bad things a
neighbor might develop on their land by preventing them in the first
place. However they are also frequenly used to prevent the increase in
value of a property by its development for more lucrative use.

<p>
Additionally, on the claim that property taxes do not punish poor
people, that is definitely false. A wealthier person uses a far smaller
percentage of their income or assets in their housing than poor people,
who frequently pay more than %40 of their annual income and 100% of
their savings on providing shelter for their families. In this way,
property tax is definitely a regressive tax. Moreover, communities which
are predominantly made up of poor people and k-mart type businesses have
far lower dollar value per acre than a community of yuppies, high rent 
and haut couture shopping, professional service corporations, and well
endowed private institutions. Because of this disparity, a person in a
poor communty is likely to pay two to four times as much per $1000.00
value of property than a wealthy person in a property wealthy community.
In this way it is also regressive, unless the state imposes the same
dollar tax per thousand dollar value on every property owner.

<p>
<a name="4283qlink1">The problem with evenly apportioned taxes like this is that it is
anti-environmental and anti-rural,<a name="3795qlink6"> unless specific exemptions are
written in for farmland and wilderness property. A farmer will</a> find it
</a>
more profitable to subdivide his land and sell it off to developers and
homebuilders of all kinds, so he can retire to Florida, rather than
maintaining the rural character of the community, while wilderness
owners will build vacation rentals and displace habitat for wild
species.

<p>
<a name="3795qlink7">Now, should property taxes be applied at the federal level?</a> What value
does the federal government give to my property other than depressing it
with their inflationary fiat money policies? Welfare and other
entitlements add nothing to my property, and environmental laws prevent
me from draining and developing 'wetlands' that were not wetlands ten or
twenty years ago, since the definitions seem to change toward more
restrictive ones every so often. National defense? Maybe, but what
exemption should I get for the fact that I am a veteran and have
contributed years of my life to that defense at below minimum wages?

<p>
I think its clear than no matter what type of tax you use to confiscate
people's money for a monopoly government, it is never simple.
