The problem I see with this notion of metaorganism and their rights<br>
is that it winds up being in practice, the "right" of the leaders of<br>
existing institutions to impose their will on other people.  Thus, I<br>
think the case for metaorganisms has not been truly made.  It is an<br>
analogy which is easily abused, and the abuse of it plays into the<br>
hands of existing and would be elites.<br>
<p>
BTW, the idea is not all that new.  The organic view of society goes<br>
back at least to Plato.  (Just wanted to bring up this point because it<br>
appears a lot of Extropians/transhumanists tend to think ideas like<br>
this are relatively new and cutting edge.  In terms of memes, there<br>
may be a suseptibility among our kind to anything which can be<br>
packaged as "innovative", "radical", "cutting edge", etc.)<br>
