<p>
I agree.  I did not mean to leave out genetic or other factors.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The second is developing other approaches.  Current delivery</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; systems are not very advanced.  The body can take of itself</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; mostly, so injecting or ingesting a chemical often does work at</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; extending lifespan.  However, when the oil filter in your car</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; gets old, you don't pour in some oil additives -- you change the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; filter.  Following the analogy further, when you can't replace a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; car part, often you can have it repaired.  Chemical life extension</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is more like filling up with detergent gasoline then do major auto</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; repairs.  Of course, if nanotechnology arrives, this will be much</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; easier...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unfortunately replacing aged organs doesn't seem to help much,</i><br>
<i>&gt;especially since the organs we really would like to rejuvenate (immune</i><br>
<i>&gt;system, endocrine system and possibly the brain) are not easy to</i><br>
<i>&gt;transplant or replace.</i><br>
<p>
In some/many cases, there might be psychological benefits.  Naturally,<br>
it'd be great to rejuvenate/replace the immune or endocrine systems.<br>
However, some people tend to get very depressed over, say, their<br>
looks.  Ergo, skin replacement might alleviate that problem AND allow<br>
research on that organ (the skin) to carry over to others (the endocrine?).<br>
The fit here is loose, but not so loose as to make it unlikely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; In the interim, we need strategies that are a bit more sophisticated</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; than ingesting some neat chemicals, yet are not so advanced as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to be only workable in computer simulations.  Where does this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; interemediary between current life extension techniques and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; nanotechnology lie?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Biotechnology? I'm quite interested in the work that is being done</i><br>
<i>&gt;with neural precursor cells, which could help repair the brain. Maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt;we could use cloning to create totiopotent cells to replace our old</i><br>
<i>&gt;(delivery is still a problem, of course). Another possibility is</i><br>
<i>&gt;geneticly engineered cells or tissues that produce necessary hormones</i><br>
<i>&gt;continually inside the body.</i><br>
<p>
Cloning is definitely in need of further investigation.  I would only hope<br>
someone starts doing the research quickly so that the general public<br>
can see real benefits to weigh against imagined fears.  Controlling<br>
totipotent cells is another area to investigate.  It is my understanding,<br>
this is not hard, given some experiments with transplanting embryo<br>
brain cells to Parkinson's sufferers (human or otherwise, I can't recall).<br>
<p>
I was under the impression that gene therapy was already being done<br>
with genetically engineered cells which provided products directly<br>
inside/to the body.  I see no principled reason why this can't be done<br>
for hormones or Vitamin C or what have you.<br>
