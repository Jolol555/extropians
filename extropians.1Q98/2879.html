<p>
Not meaningless, but it is a trivial truth.  Have you ever tried to<br>
prove a mathematical theorem?  A proof often amounts to fiddling with<br>
both sides of an equation, replacing terms with equivalent expressions,<br>
until you're left with something like "u + ax = u + ax" - something<br>
which is utterly boring in itself, but which implies the truth of the<br>
proposition.<br>
<p>
Deny the value of such trivial truths, and you deny the foundation of<br>
all logical proof.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The philosopher Ludwig</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Josef Johann Wittgenstein was absolutely right</i><br>
<i>&gt;   to observe that "to say of one thing that it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;   identical with itself is to say nothing at all."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   The statement "A=A" is purported to tell us about</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the nature of identity, and yet it fails by 100%.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; it cannot be said to be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; true identity theory,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;A definition is not a theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: A defintion of A tells us what</i><br>
<i>&gt;   A is,</i><br>
<p>
Not exactly.  We may define _star_ as "one of those shiny things in the<br>
night sky," and this definition is sufficient to distinguish stars from<br>
non-stars; but this does not tell us much about what a star is.  Every<br>
human language has a word for _star_, and everyone with good eyesight<br>
agrees on the definition of the word (with an exception that I'll come<br>
to later); but until recently there was no agreement on a theory as to<br>
what stars are.<br>
<p>
A definition of a mathematical or logical construct, on the other hand,<br>
"tells us what A is" because such a construct - an integral, for example<br>
- has no existence apart from its (manmade) definition, unlike a star.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and a theory of identity</i><br>
<i>&gt;   tells us what identity is.</i><br>
<p>
But that's circular.  Since identity is a symbolic construct - you can't<br>
go out and dig up rocks and find an "identity" - identity can only be<br>
what it is defined to be; a theory follows from the definitions.<br>
<p>
You've decided that the conventional definition of identity is boring,<br>
and you've invented another definition (which appears to be "identity =<br>
description").  That's okay; science does this from time to time.  The<br>
Greeks did not regard zero and one as numbers, so their theorems<br>
sometimes needed to treat zero and one as special cases; later<br>
mathematicians found it more convenient to redefine "number" to include<br>
1 and 0 and -1 and -4+i.  The ancients thought of Mars, but not the Sun,<br>
as a star; we have adopted a more useful definition of _star_ that<br>
excludes Mars and includes the Sun.  And we've removed the Sun from the<br>
classical list of "planets", and added the Earth.<br>
<p>
These changes in the uses of words do not require us to reject all<br>
writings of the Greeks that made special cases of zero and one, or old<br>
astronomical records that call Mars a star.  Nor does your new construct<br>
which you call "identity" entitle you to say that everything that uses<br>
the conventional definition of "identity" is wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   The statement "A=A" does not</i><br>
<i>&gt;   tell us what identity is.</i><br>
<p>
Identity is defined as the relation which each entity has with itself<br>
and with no other entity.  Maybe that's our problem: I see identity as a<br>
relation, you see it as a property.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; and logic therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; dictates that it must be a false theory,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; particularly when the identity theory,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; "A=A+~A," is never shown to be false.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Because it is vacuous.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: But the statement "A=A" is not??!!</i><br>
<p>
Nope.  "A=A" distinguishes A from that which is not A.  "A=A+~A" does<br>
not: since A+~A is the whole universe, A+~A = B+~B for any B, thus A=B<br>
for any A,B; any two things are equal to each other.  Thus, as you say,<br>
this relation can never be false.<br>
<p>
I hope you'll give this new kind of "identity" a new name.  It does have<br>
a slight similarity to conventional identity: both are equivalence<br>
relations (reflexive, transitive and symmetric).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;"A=A" is *useful*. "A = the whole universe" may be interesting in some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;contexts but where does it get us?!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: To the truth.</i><br>
<p>
Let me know when you have a theorem more interesting than<br>
"everything=everything".<br>
