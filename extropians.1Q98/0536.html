I would recommend carnitine (levocarnitine/ l-carnitine) for a safe <br>
and effective increase in assertiveness/agression. As a bonus it makes <br>
your muscles firm without any exercise. Good to gain some (muscle) <br>
weight too. Also, to those who can safely obtain it, I would recommend<br>
the use of cannabis. It can be a very effective anti-depressant, and it<br>
enhances all your senses, often for days and probably even permanently,<br>
to some extend. When you're properly high, you also tend to get very<br>
creative, and it is a great aphrodisiac. It can even help to stop an<br>
upcoming case of the flu (by somehow boosting the immune system).<br>
All in all a very transhuman substance, methinks!<br>
