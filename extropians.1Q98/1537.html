Yep, spot on - but it's not really *sf* that is replete with horror and<br>
ghastly imagery so much as *sci fi*, its idiot younger brother.  Alas, the<br>
cretin is the one whom most people meet in the street.  <br>
<p>
The reason why key sf novels such as Heinlein's STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND<br>
were so wildly popular is exactly their warm &amp; fuzzy quotient, alongside a<br>
subtext of bracing sardonic skepticism concerning many traditional<br>
oppressive values.  The most beloved sf from the 1950s bears this out<br>
exactly, I think - Ted Sturgeon's work especially, with its superhuman<br>
gestalts struggling to emerge against the hostility, indifference and<br>
cruelty of `ordinary homo sap, Zenna Henderson's sentimental `People'<br>
stories, with their psi-powered superhumans, Van Vogt's SLAN (which grows<br>
bleaker, it's true, as it turns into a cold-blooded power fantasy), much of<br>
Arthur Clarke's redemptive, aspiring, gloriously poignant visions of the<br>
remote future...  <br>
<p>
And yet the market ninnies, when they don't simply let such key work slip<br>
out of print, seem to be stuck in the nasty 10-year-old playground<br>
tear-wings-off-flies mentality - or at least they assume most sf readers<br>
are.  So the artwork is either insanely malign weaponry jerkoffs, or<br>
twisted mutants and deformed faces that are somehow meant to be symbolic<br>
(metonymic) of `the future'.  <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, the fantasy genre that hived off sf has gone in the<br>
chocolate-box art direction with billowing clouds and unicorns and<br>
handsome/beautiful wish fulfilment figures... and it way outsells sf,<br>
surprise surprise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	I was raised in the LDS church.  Have you ever been to the LDS</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Temple Square" in SLC?  That is a good example of "warm and fuzzy"</i><br>
<i>&gt;and that is why they are growing the way they are.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly.  On the other hand, we surely don't want to get into corrupt<br>
bullshit like fundamentalist Xian art, with its happy 1950s families rising<br>
into the glowing sunset of the Apocalypse *in their levitating Chevvies*...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	Take, for example, the cover of TFI.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;that cracked and cold face just turns people,</i><br>
<i>&gt;especially women, right off with a shiver.</i><br>
<p>
Just so.  This is the iconography of abjection and fear, and it is an error<br>
of the first water to stick with it.  But I gather that it's the guys at<br>
the coalface of distribution whose opinions count most nowadays, and they<br>
know nothing of either the contents or the actual readers, just some blurry<br>
guesstimate of their own ignorance, which then feeds back into numerical<br>
data, and it all goes into a blindingly stupid loop of illogic that drives<br>
out interesting, subtle work that might otherwise modify the cracked, cold<br>
face of the genre - and works of advocacy such as FIRST IMMORTAL.  <br>
