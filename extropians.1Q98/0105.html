<i>&gt; One version has morphing objects moving along a time axis, affecting</i><br>
<i>&gt; each other in various ways. </i><br>
<p>
Sounds impressive but not very useful for real analysis. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A more ambitious version would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; physics-like interactivity among the items (e.g. ideas bounce off each </i><br>
<i>&gt; other, new projects squeeze out old), no time axis.</i><br>
<p>
What about a general time axis (past to the right, future to the left,<br>
but no real scale)?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some work has been done on connecting the objects with colored lines </i><br>
<i>&gt; and with transparent rods (etc.) having their own attributes.</i><br>
<p>
Elasticity and tension could be used to make the linked objects to<br>
cluster together. And if you want to find out what is related to<br>
something, just drag it and watch what else moves.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Two major problems with this idea:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Representing abstract concepts with 3D objects. Making them out of text</i><br>
<i>&gt; helps a little, but screen resolution is a constraint.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Picking what the other two (or all three) axes represent (I have a most </i><br>
<i>&gt; unfortunate disability: visualizing multidimensional structures is</i><br>
<i>&gt; nearly </i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible.) Picking multiple views helps a little, using an axis for</i><br>
<i>&gt; more </i><br>
<i>&gt; than one property can get confusing, using layers helps sometimes.</i><br>

You might be interested in NaviGraph by James Wen,<br>
<a href="http://www.escape.com/~jimwen/naviGraph/naviGraph.html">http://www.escape.com/~jimwen/naviGraph/naviGraph.html</a> He has an<br>
applet that shows his web in 3D, where the third dimension is used to<br>
show a different kind of information than the other two. He has a<br>
paper about it which might be interesting:<br>

<i>&gt; One project I would like to do is to represent the past history of</i><br>
<i>&gt; science and technology this way (I don't have the time for this,</i><br>
<i>&gt; though), as a means of  developing a future technology visual aid. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The vacuum tube, for example, is represented as threads of icons in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the 19th century and earlier (light bulb, vacuum pump, etc.) that </i><br>
<i>&gt; coalesce into a tube icon near the turn of the 20th century. New </i><br>
<i>&gt; threads spring from this, for triodes, pentodes, Klystrons, etc. </i><br>
<i>&gt; These merge with other threads to form radio amps,</i><br>
<i>&gt; radar, etc. Then most fade away with the advent of the transistor-</i><br>
<i>&gt; the derivatives keep going.</i><br>
<p>
That would be great! Reminds me a bit of the technology graph in Civilization.<br>
