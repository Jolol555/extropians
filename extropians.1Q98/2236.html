Why, yes, of course! Let's build a *spaceship*, fly to Mars and just claim the<br>
whole damn planet. Off you go! Mmm, you'd probably still need some kind<br>
of island as a launch base of course...A new focus for the transhuman effort?<br>
<p>
Seriously, if this isn't a project worth considering, then I wouldn't know what<br>
is...<br>
Extropia: the mutual aid organization for the survival of extremely rapid and <br>
profound future technological and social change (a/k/a Singularity). Primary<br>
goal: establish a permanent independent space habitat (a Marsbase makes<br>
most sense for obvious reasons).<br>
