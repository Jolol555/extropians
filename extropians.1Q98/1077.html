<i>&gt; &gt; What I really worry about is 30 years down the road.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The population control program in China is having the effect of a much</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What sociologists and what societies? As far as I know, there have not</i><br>
<i>&gt; been that many societies with imbalanced populations of genders</i><br>
<i>&gt; (possibly in some of the smaller arabian states: I have read somewhere</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a significant fraction of the girls were in the harem at some</i><br>
<i>&gt; points in history; this might be apocryphal though).</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure exactly. I've heard this several times in the past (so I'm sure its<br>
true ;) ) but I'll have to check up on it. I think some of it was to do with some<br>
african societies having gender imbalances that caused eras of increased tribal<br>
strife.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I wonding if having so many frustrated males in the population 20-30</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; years from now will wind up with a much more militarist regieme</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; coming to power.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is frustrated males a significant factor in militarism? Could they not</i><br>
<i>&gt; also be a source for subversion or major-scale sublimation?</i><br>
<p>
That is the mechanism. For the establishment to respond effectively to the<br>
threat, they must institute a harsh regeime, with heavy nationalist/militarist<br>
tones to it to keep the subversive forces in check.. (Japan 1880-1945 comes to<br>
mind as an example, as well as possibly the whole samurai era.)<br>
