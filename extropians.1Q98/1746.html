Michael Lorrey:<br>
<i>&gt;Will that mean</i><br>
<i>&gt;that two people having sex at age 25 in that future will be comitting date</i><br>
<i>&gt;rape, statutory rape, pedophilia, or what have you??? </i><br>
<p>
Michael, no one has made such a contention, and I myself have stated <br>
that the age of consent could be lowered by many years with no real <br>
harm to anyone.  But, again, to move beyond that in my own work I <br>
would need to see some real information, like a study or a reputable <br>
critique, because I have already spent many hours discussing the <br>
issue with clinicians, known pedophiles and reading current medical <br>
work on it, and haven't found the information to support changing <br>
most of the existing child protections.<br>
<p>
Sin<br>
