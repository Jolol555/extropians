<i>&gt; I have complained about this before, but nobody seems to do anything about</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.  The duplicate addresses and CC:'s are being added by the List software</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself.  I don't think it is efficient to try to get everybody who posts to</i><br>
<i>&gt; this list to try to remember to remove the duplicate addresses.  If we</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe in Intelligent Technology, then why are we running brain-dead</i><br>
<i>&gt; software?  Why are we asking the humans to readdress mail to override the</i><br>
<i>&gt; List Software?</i><br>
<p>
This is not a fault with the List serv sw! It is doing the right thing -<br>
ie it puts a "Reply-To:" line in the header. That is SMTP* compliant. If<br>
you're lucky, you've got a properly designed email program which has<br>
prefs that allow you to reply to everyone listed in the header or just<br>
the default respondee (ie the "Reply-to:" adressee if there is one, the<br>
"From:" adressee if there is not). Under Eudora(Mac), for instance, look<br>
under Special/Settings/Replying.<br>
<p>
*[SMTP - Simple Mail Transport Protocol, is the defacto method of<br>
pushing email msgs around on the net. The protocol is fairly extensive<br>
and has been well-honed over the last decade or two. It allows<br>
well-designed client-side sw a lot of versatility]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Asking every List subscriber to readdress the postings properly to fix the</i><br>
<i>&gt; bad addressing of the List Software is very inefficient.  Sometimes humans</i><br>
<i>&gt; forget.</i><br>
<p>
You need only make the change to your prefs once. Learn to use the sw<br>
*you* have correctly before flaming about the server. This is a<br>
client-side issue.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You realize that your suggestion, while functional, would break other</i><br>
<i>&gt;e-mail situations, and corrects a problem that only this List has? </i><br>
<p>
incorrect.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes I do have my mail set to reply to all participants. </i><br>
<p>
There's your problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If I get mail "From: Person A", "To: Person B", "CC: Person C", and</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Reply-To: Person D", I really do want my comments to go back to all of</i><br>
<i>&gt;them. </i><br>
<p>
But Person A (really Adressee A) has requested that you reply only to<br>
Adressese D. If you wish to overide their wishes, you can usually hold<br>
down a modifier key while replying to overide this default behaviour<br>
(for instance, it's the option key w/Eudora(Mac)).<br>
<p>
The SMTP address scheme, although not perfect, is well suited to deal<br>
with situations such as this mailing list. I find that the extropy list<br>
is managed quite well, all things considered. <br>
<p>
tschau,<br>
