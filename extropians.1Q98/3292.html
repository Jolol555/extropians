There are lots of other things too.<br>
Mild testosterone boosters (such as Androstene) may help build both muscle <br>
and assertiveness, Ecstasy increases compassion, while its after-effects<br>
dissolve one's respect to artificial psychological and legal boundaries; mixes<br>
of some psychedelics and nootropics (i.e., mescalin and DMAE) enhance<br>
one's perception while preserving cognitive function; GHB fights depression<br>
and improves one's physical state, etc., etc.  There are seem to be lots of<br>
drugs that can be safely used for flexing and reconstructing one's personality<br>
architecture.  Unfortunately, the majority of both experimenters and<br>
regulators<br>
seem unable to explore the mind-altering substances in an open, meaningful,<br>
and responsible manner, so there is very little data, and grave dangers for<br>
one's well-being from both law-enforcers and law-breakers. <br>
This reminds me of another repressive regime where I had to risk my<br>
health and career to obtain books from black marketeers.<br>
(Talk about indifference of transhumanism to politics...)<br>
<p>
Could anybody recommend a serious private discussion groups that deals<br>
with these topics - or be interested in forming one?<br>
