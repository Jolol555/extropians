Several people have speculated that Mr.Simon did not sign up for <br>
cryonics because he was depressed. However, since he published a book <br>
about overcoming depression, you could make the case that he probably <br>
didn't have that problem at the time he died. Who really knows?<br>
<p>
The fact is that there are dozens of reasons why people don't sign up <br>
for cryonics. Most people aren't depressed, and most of them don't sign <br>
up. We'll probably never know why Mr. Simon didn't sign up.<br>
<p>
It would be interesting to do a good scientific study of the reasons <br>
people don't sign up. If I had any money, I'd fund it.<br>
