	While I don't pretend that God speaks to me much more or clearer than<br>
to John or the average extropian, I don't believe that He ever<br>
"endorsed" revenge or that He "invented hell" as an actual place filled<br>
with sinners (this is an article of faith).  Rather, today these ideas<br>
are only known to be endorsed by fundamentalist Christian denominations.<br>
	Today, more often than not, Christian demoninations do not accept the<br>
mostly Old Testament view that God is a God of revenge and punishment. <br>
Rather, He is a God of love and forgiveness (and always has been).<br>
	Also, most believe that God (or his Prophets) used "hell" as a device<br>
to scare immature, semi-civilized peasants living 2000 years ago into<br>
behaving morally.  While the threat of "hell" may have worked for those<br>
peasants (Lawrence Kohlberg defines this as the "Punishment Avoidance<br>
stage of moral development," today it works mostly on toddlers.  <br>
	Like any idea (or technology), I believe His words have been perverted<br>
by people for (dare I say) evil or other ends having nothing to do with<br>
Him or His Word. <br>
