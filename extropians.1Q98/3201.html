<p>
A set of slides from the military office responsible for GPS describes<br>
this problem as well as Y2K compliance issues at:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.laafb.af.mil/SMC/CZ/homepage/y2000/y2k/tsld001.htm">http://www.laafb.af.mil/SMC/CZ/homepage/y2000/y2k/tsld001.htm</a><br>
<p>
According to slide 4,<br>
<p>
      GPS system time counts weeks from midnight 5-6 Jan 1980 in modulo<br>
      1024 (0-1023)<br>
<p>
      No year or century data is included in the Navigation Message -<br>
      Subframe 1 (Word 3)<br>
<p>
      GPS week rolls over from week 1023 to week 0000 at midnight 21-22<br>
      August 1999 and approximately every 20 years thereafter<br>
<p>
      Clearly documented in ICD-GPS-200, para 3.3.4(b)<br>
<p>
      GPS receiver manufacturers responsible for their designs conforming<br>
      to ICD-GPS-200<br>
<p>
So the problem occurs the night of August 21, 1999, when the week counter<br>
rolls over from 1023 to 0.  This is part of the GPS spec but some<br>
receivers may not have been thoroughly tested for proper operation during<br>
this transition.<br>
<p>
The other slides indicate that the GPS satellites themselves have been<br>
verified to have Y2K and rollover compliance, but some of the ground<br>
support software is on older mainframes and has some Y2K issues.<br>
I gather that the ground software would not affect the operation of<br>
the satellites in terms of giving out good data, but would affect the<br>
military's own use of the satellites.<br>
