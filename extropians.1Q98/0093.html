"Played around" is the operative phrase- it consists mostly of ideas<br>
and a few tests in some of my animation software (RayDream 5, <br>
Trispectives 2).<br>
One version has morphing objects moving along a time axis, affecting<br>
each other in various ways. A more ambitious version would have<br>
physics-like interactivity among the items (e.g. ideas bounce off each <br>
other, new projects squeeze out old), no time axis.<br>
Some work has been done on connecting the objects with colored lines <br>
and with transparent rods (etc.) having their own attributes.<br>
It is these connections, and how they grow and interweave over time, <br>
that are of most interest. As a personal planner, I put priority on one<br>
axis.<br>
There was a  Quipu (sp?), Digital Quipu thread on this list a couple<br>
months <br>
ago about how the Inca represented information without text. There may<br>
be ideas<br>
from that system that are applicable.<br>
<p>
Some reasons for using animation software:<br>
Being able to turn features such as detail levels, whole layers,<br>
attributes, etc. on and off is very appealing for a user interested <br>
in particular aspects. Picking camera angles and trajectories is <br>
also very helpful - immersive VR would be even better.<br>
<p>
Two major problems with this idea:<br>
Representing abstract concepts with 3D objects. Making them out of text<br>
helps a little, but screen resolution is a constraint.<br>
Picking what the other two (or all three) axes represent (I have a most <br>
unfortunate disability: visualizing multidimensional structures is<br>
nearly <br>
impossible.) Picking multiple views helps a little, using an axis for<br>
more <br>
than one property can get confusing, using layers helps sometimes.<br>
<p>
One project I would like to do is to represent the past history of<br>
science and technology this way (I don't have the time for this,<br>
though), as a means of  developing a future technology visual aid. <br>
The vacuum tube, for example, is represented as threads of icons in <br>
the 19th century and earlier (light bulb, vacuum pump, etc.) that <br>
coalesce into a tube icon near the turn of the 20th century. New <br>
threads spring from this, for triodes, pentodes, Klystrons, etc. <br>
These merge with other threads to form radio amps,<br>
radar, etc. Then most fade away with the advent of the transistor-<br>
the derivatives keep going.<br>
Running the simulation up to the present gives some insight into<br>
future developments, various scenarios can then be played out,<br>
bearing in mind their chaotic nature.<br>
