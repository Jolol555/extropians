<i>&gt; &gt; |GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND THE LIMITS OF PUBLIC CHOICE THEORY</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |By Paul Marks</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |Economic Notes No. 42</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ||</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |In the United States in 1960, defence spending was 12.1% of total</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |output and federal welfare spending (pensions, unemployment benefit,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |etc.) was 4.8%. In 1980 defence spending was 7.3% of total output</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |and federal welfare was 12.6%.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is the most rediculous figure I have ever seen!!  I am falling out of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; chair right now with laughter!!  Annual spending in 1980 on defense was</i><br>
<i>&gt; approximately $250 billion.  Are you actually telling me that over a quarter</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a trillion dollars was spent on welfare during the same year?  Unless of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course you do consider all the subsidies that corporations get (i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt; corporate welfare) as part of this welfare figure.</i><br>
<p>
If you think this is funny, look at social security spending. Those that claim<br>
'entitle'ments are increasing and reproducing, and the bureaucratic overhead to<br>
administer these programs is likewise expanding. Yet at $250 billion, we can<br>
barely afford to launch a short term campaign against a rather minor threat<br>
(Iraq).  In any event, if social security taxes weren't confiscated by the feds<br>
and substituted with treasury bonds, we would still have a $300 billion deficit.<br>
With the earned income tax credit acting as a front end welfare measure,<br>
basically exempting any one with at least one dependent if they make less than<br>
$30,000 from paying anything, there is a significant amount of anti-productive<br>
influences in the tax system today. Really James, I am surprised you've bought<br>
the welfare establishment's con about 'corporate welfare'. If the government<br>
wants to pay me to conduct research and development for technology or equipment<br>
they want, nobody is giving me anything for free. Welfare is when you take money<br>
from someone and give it to someone else. Failing to take money out of my pocket<br>
that I earned fairly is not welfare, it is my money. When are people going to<br>
gripe about the bureaucracy welfare, which is the keeping of millions of useless<br>
people in unproductive government jobs, merely to keep them from going postal on<br>
their neighbors or congressmen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |The wholehearted supporter of Public Choice might say that this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |because more people believe that welfare spending will benefit them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |than believe that defence spending will. But the whole point of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |libertarian economic case is that such things as the surge of "Great</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |Society" welfare programs benefit no one with the possible exception</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |of the people who administer them, that such spending increases the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |very poverty it is supposed to reduce.(2)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And this isn't the case for the military-industrial complex who has reaped</i><br>
<i>&gt; trillions of dollars is capital during the same time period?!  The same</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies who were padding their books with $1000 screws!?  Give me a break!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |Partly, this is because these schemes increase the number of poor</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |people, which in turn leads to even more welfare spending. It is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; |like the rolling of a snowball down a steep slope.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll agree with you here.  Over the long haul welfare does nothing but</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase dependency and decrease innovation both in peoples lives and that of</i><br>
<i>&gt; corporations who are not truly competing in the free-market.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My only contention to the argument against welfare though, is we need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; consider humanitarian alternatives for peoples lives as the become</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasingly superfluous in an automated high-output economy.</i><br>
