<p>
The Extropian Principles seem to function more like a fuzzy center of<br>
gravity than a *foundation* for the widespread activities that are<br>
undertaken broadly-speaking under the sign of extropianism.  My impression<br>
from discussions in extropian fora is that most people take more<br>
personally their investment in formative texts from the recommended<br>
readings list than their commitment to the principles per se.  This is why<br>
we so often find people arriving at one of our fora and exclaiming that<br>
they have been "extropians" all their lives, even though they (still) <br>
haven't gotten around to taking in the principles themselves.  And given<br>
the level of generality at which the principles are pitched and the<br>
emphasis on individual critical assessment in the principles, this would<br>
seem to be as it should be.  <br>
	But this leads me to think that the extropianism that takes the<br>
principles as its point of departure is not exactly the same thing as what<br>
people seem to mean by an extropian "movement," with a coherent public<br>
agenda.  Elsewhere, Max More describes PCR as a "metacontext for memetic<br>
progress," and it seems one could describe the Principles as a<br>
"metacontext for individual flourishing in the face of dynamic<br>
technological change".  This does not seem to me to be the stuff from<br>
which *social* movements are culled.  The principles as they stand seem to<br>
me too complex, too suggestive, too open-ended to be reducible to a bumper<br>
sticker, to cash out into a readily intelligible and coherent political<br>
agenda.  I can't think what it would mean for extropianism to "sweep the<br>
world" -- which is what most movements hope for themselves.  I wonder just<br>
what you mean when you glibly offer up the spectacle of extropianism, "the<br>
meme".  Just what would that be?  "Best do it so"?  With *all* that that<br>
implies?  With all that that is open to?  As I said before, maybe all this<br>
is just to say that extropians don't really properly aspire to be a<br>
"movement" at all.  I just want a clearer sense of what they do mean when<br>
they *say* it.<br>
<p>
Best, Dale<br>
