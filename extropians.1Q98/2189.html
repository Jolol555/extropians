<i>       &gt;&gt;Me:  </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;In my example the demon did not tell the man of his prediction but </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;now lets pretend he did. Suppose also that the man, being of an</i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;argumentative nature, was determined to do the exact opposite of </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;what the demon predicted. Now our poor demon would be in a familiar</i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;predicament. Because the demon's decision influences the man's </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;actions the demon must forecast his own behavior, but he will have </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;no better luck in this regard than the man did and for the same </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;reasons. What we would need in a situation like this is a mega-demon </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;able to look into the demon's head. Now the mega-demon would have </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;the problem.</i><br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;Bart Troyan &lt;btroyan@yahoo.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>        &gt;why can't the demon also account for and predict the man's subsequent </i><br>
<i>        &gt;reversal in response to learning of the demon's prediction?</i><br>
         <br>
Because the demon won't know what the demon will predict so he can't account <br>
for the demon's prediction.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The demon can simply lie to the man, saying "you will choose the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;high road", when he knew the man was actually going to choose the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;low road based only on his original brain state. </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
Well certainly, but that's virtually equivalent to my original thought  <br>
experiment where the demon did not tell the man of his prediction. <br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The man does the opposite of what the demon predicts, but the demon,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;although having lied to the man, still correctly predicted the man's         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;behavior from its own perspective.</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
But not from the perspective of the man or any other third parties. <br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;The whole argument about people who do the opposite of what you         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;predict doesn't shed much light on free will, in my opinion.</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
I think it sheds as much light on free will as the subject deserves, <br>
damn little.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;Imagine a computer program which outputs a 0 or 1.  You are supposed         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to type in your prediction of what it will output, and then it prints         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;out its choice. Now write the program so that regardless of what you         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;input, it prints out the opposite value. [...] This does not reflect      </i><br>
<i>        &gt;any true inability to predict the future of these systems.   </i><br>
      <br>
<p>
It seems clear to me that is does restrict your ability to predict this  <br>
system, unless you keep it secret, and if you do that the prediction isn't of <br>
much use.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;jase1@uniserve.com        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Well, certain -justifications- for a criminal justice system would         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;be things of the past.</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
Yes indeed, that's the point. In the matter of criminal law the general  <br>
public, and lawyers in particular, have some strange ideas about the purpose  <br>
of punishment. They seem to feel that if someone has derived pleasure in an <br>
evil way it is the law's duty to somehow balance the books by making the <br>
lawbreaker suffer. The clich‚ about man being responsible for his own actions <br>
is merely a rationalization for sadism. This leads to endless convoluted <br>
irrelevant arguments reminiscent of the medieval one about pins and dancing <br>
angles. What was the mental state of the lawbreaker? Did he grow up in a good <br>
home as a child? Did he undergo a lot of strain as a adult? Is there anything <br>
physically wrong with his brain? Was he in full control of his faculties? <br>
And even a question that philosophers fight about to this day "does he know <br>
the difference between right and wrong?". Little wonder that the legal system <br>
is hopelessly backlogged.               <br>
<p>
The only logical or moral reason for punishing a wrongdoer is to prevent a <br>
similar crime from happening in the future; it's the difference between <br>
justice and vengeance. Making an evil person suffer just for the fun of <br>
seeing him in pain is pointless and cruel, after all a bad man suffers just <br>
as intensely as a good man.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It could certainly no longer be seen as a means of prevention or         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;rehabilitation.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Huh? If the state of a serial murderer's brain causes him to do evil things  <br>
and you change its state so it no longer does evil things, then the brain has  <br>
been improved and is obviously a good thing to do. We can do that right now <br>
in about a minute with 10 amps of current at several thousand volts.  <br>
Someday there will be methods that are somewhat more subtle.            <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It fact, it wouldn't really be justice, it would just be a means </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of retribution.  </i><br>
         <br>
I don't follow that at all.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Or more like societal screening.  Get rid of the 'bad ones' </i><br>
<p>
Exactly. Getting rid of the serial murders seems like a wise policy to me.  <br>
What does that have to do with retribution?<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Granted, a flipped coin is incapable of predicting its behaviour,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;but insofar as it is incapable of acting upon its state, it clearly         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;is not 'free.'</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Part of a coin is its momentum, the coin's momentum acts on its state and  <br>
determines what side it will land on. Part of you is your desires, your <br>
desires acts on your state and determines what job you will accept.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Free will is the ability of a system to make choices which         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;ostensibily allow it to alter it's "fate;" </i><br>
<p>
<p>
OK, but the initial conditions of any system will always alter it's fate.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In order for this system to be able to 'choose' among these routes,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;it cannot be contrained by any internal or external pre-determinism.          </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Then our actions have no cause, when somebody behaves strangely it's <br>
pointless to ask "why did you do that?" because there is no reason, no cause, <br>
all our actions are random.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The key then to free will lies not only in the unpredictabilty of a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;system's behaviour, but it's internal ability to choose it's        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;behaviour.  This is not an observable trait!  </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
If free will is an unobservable trait then logic can not help us and there is <br>
no point wasting valuable brain cells thinking about it. I'm not interested <br>
in unobservable traits, that's why the tooth faire, the soul, Peter Pan, God, <br>
or devil demons from pango pango bore me to tears.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It appears to me that I have free will.     </i><br>
          <br>
Me too. According to my definition there is no doubt, I do have free will.               <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I feel strongly that -I- am 'choosing' to type at this keyboard         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;right now.  I feel this way because I am aware of the possibility of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;doing something other than typing at this keyboard.  I am unaware of  </i><br>
<i>        &gt;anything 'forcing' me to type at this keyboard. I can  test this         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;belief very easily. I can stop typing.  I can continue typing.  </i><br>
<p>
          <br>
I've talked about free will before and somebody always includes a <br>
demonstration. Usually someone picks up an object and drops it from one hand <br>
to the other and says "This proves I have Free Will, I can hold it in my hand <br>
or I can drop it. If I drop it it's not because anything made me, in fact I <br>
could have held on to it but I didn't feel like it". When I ask why he didn't <br>
feel like it the only answer I get is "I just didn't!" as if that explained <br>
everything. If I point out that I was the cause of the demonstration by <br>
bringing up the subject in the first place, anger sometimes results. <br>
<p>
To say "I can chose to do what I want to" is not an expression of absolute <br>
freedom but a severe restriction on it for the clear implication is "I can't <br>
choose anything I don't want to".<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I am possesed of the experience of free will.  But does this mean         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that I do indeed *have* free will?</i><br>
          <br>
Yes. If you feel free you are free.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;can we have free will independent of our perception of it?</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
As I've said many times, you need to tell us what free will is, and do so in  <br>
clear consistent unambiguous language, then we can debate whether people  <br>
have it or not. I've done just that with my definition, I haven't seen  <br>
anybody else do the same.<br>
