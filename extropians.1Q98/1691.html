I have a 'thing' which I call to "talk them out."  Basically you get<br>
your mind to function like theirs.  Then you start to talk to them<br>
about general problems from their perspective.  Then slowly change<br>
from their perspective to your own and they'll start to do the same. <br>
It sounds like a long process, but with practise you can do it in a<br>
matter of seconds.<br>
<p>
It takes years of practise (see below), but it can be fun.<br>

I started a sort of 'metaprogramming' about 4 years ago and managed to<br>
're-link' my emotions and motivations in a more rational way.  But I<br>
started to lack all motivation (except to live, it would seem) which<br>
started to make things difficult.  So I needed a fix, so I figured if<br>
I can change my mind state why not learn to link and re-link emotions<br>
at will (actually easier than it sounds.)  Now, the way I manage to<br>
talk people into my point of view (it doesn't work through e-mail BTW,<br>
I've tried) is by quickly re-linking these emotions into a way their<br>
body language, tone of voice and use of language suggests.  And then<br>
bringing myself back to my usual state.  But I really don't suggest<br>
everyone doing it, because for about six months I was close to<br>
homicidal (which, to say the least, isn't a fun experience.)  BTW, I<br>
didn't use any guides or books for this (I didn't know they existed) I<br>
just came to the conclusion that I could make my mind run faster and<br>
changed it.<br>
