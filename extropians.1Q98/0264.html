So far, you're spot on. There used to be little naphtha-fired catalytic<br>
heaters the size of a thin bar of soap that you could buy at sporting<br>
goods stores, for pocket handwarmers. I don't know if they're still sold,<br>
or if not, why not; maybe one too many sauced ice fishermen with<br>
frostbite damage compounded by third-degree burns?. Getting complete<br>
combustion seems a bit tricky, but I see no reason why you couldn't put a<br>
platinum post-stage combustor on one. Cost would go up, of course.<br>
<p>
A microprocessor-mediated warmer of this type seems possible, as does<br>
combustion regulation using bimetals or shape memory alloys.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is breaking down</i><br>
<i>&gt; water from melting snow, slowly burning the H and exhausting the O2</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible in a tiny device with today's tech? This would seem a</i><br>

<i>&gt; moisture in some form present.</i><br>
<p>
Problem is, you've got it backwards. The H is already burned. That's what<br>
oxidation _is_ (*doh!*). So you have to pump energy into the water to<br>
electrolyze it, at least according to conventional models. Danny may think<br>
differently. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; to manufacture personal heater devices "out there" unless they</i><br>
<i>&gt; could sell them "here" or other places for use in uncontrolled</i><br>
<i>&gt; temperature environments (like the surfaces of planets)?...</i><br>
<p>
Personal heaters, water heaters and the like made by using relatively<br>
"hot" radioisotopes are, in the narrowest technical sense, a terrifically<br>
appropriate use of energy that would otherwise go to waste. The heat is<br>
going to be generated whether those ceramic pellets are at the bottom of a<br>
mineshaft or embedded in your self-heating floor. The environmentally <br>
tricky part is picking isotopes with nuclear decay paths that don't result<br>
in unmanageable neutron-activation of surrounding materials, or gamma<br>
radiation, or radon emission. This could be a tall order; I'm no expert.<br>
<p>
However, given how flipped-out people are about something as unthreatening<br>
as asbestos-based building materials, which are mostly only dangerous<br>
while you're creating them or (trying to) destroy them, I don't see<br>
passive heat pellets (which share that threat profile) making any<br>
commercial headway in the current culture.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Technology-wise, Mr. Fusion is a great idea.  ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I've heard that traditional Korean houses are heated by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wood-burning stove under the house whose chimney is a meandering</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ceramic pipe buried in the floor. A high-tech version of this might</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; let you put the burner outside the tent while still getting nearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; all the heat into the tent.</i><br>
<p>
The Romans used to do this; they might have gotten the idea from the<br>
Etruscans. Transfer efficiency can be high; cleaning the chimney can be<br>
easy or a bitch, all depending on your design details.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That's sounds like a good innovation that could be applied for</i><br>
<i>&gt; today's camping gear. You might even invert this: have the (tiny)</i><br>
<i>&gt; heater sit inside the tent, and have small, flexible, insolated</i><br>
<i>&gt; pipes (hoses?) vent in air and out exhaust. Or would this be</i><br>
<i>&gt; an unworkable contraption on the small-scale? Maybe an arctic</i><br>
<i>&gt; survival heater similar to this already exists? Or would this be</i><br>
<i>&gt; an unworkable contraption on the small-scale?</i><br>
<p>
Having been doing a little study in the area of thermal transfer in the<br>
shirtsleeve-to-burning-paper regime lately, permit me to take a BOE shot:<br>
<p>
Seems to me what you want is a pair of heat exchangers, one to preheat the<br>
incoming air, the other to draw heat from the exhaust and put it into<br>
circulating ("house") air and the preheater. Duct them (both?) from<br>
outside, get good circulation inside the tent, don't let the firebox leak,<br>
and you're in there. If you only duct the exhaust, there are tradeoffs:<br>
slightly simpler system, but possibly some drafts. No matter what,<br>
there's also always going to be some chance that a poorly-set-up system or<br>
changing winds could interfere with proper operation due to pressure<br>
heads. Such interference could be, in worst case, fatal (fire, CO).<br>
<p>
I am sure there is a weight and size penalty for those<br>
heat exchangers. How much? Depends on your tech, I'd guess.<br>
