Has anyone had the chance to read Michael Duff's rollicking dispatch<br>
of string-theory in favor of M-theory in this month's SCIENTIFIC<br>
AMERICAN?  He cross-references a couple of articles from PHYSICS<br>
TODAY, and I wish that he had written this article for that<br>
publication, as he might have been able to go into longer and more <br>
connected explanations.  As it is, he skips from supersymmetry to <br>
11-dimensional calculations and leaps into p-branes with very little <br>
transitional text.  (Also in this month's PHYSICS TODAY:  several verbal <br>
2x4's regarding an omission from the September article on Lise <br>
Meitner).  <br>
<p>
Still, you have to love a quote like this one:  'Indeed, future <br>
terrestial historians may judge the late 20th century as a time when <br>
theorists were like children playing on the seashore, diverting <br>
themselves with the smoother pebbles or prettier shells of <br>
superstrings while the great ocean of M-theory lay undiscovered <br>
before them.'<br>
