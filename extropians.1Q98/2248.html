<i>&gt; overall goal may require us to be more flexible than that would allow.</i><br>
The need for a physical location varies with the political climate etc, but<br>
in any case you'll need a safe place to launch the initial spacecraft from<br>
to start the construction of your actual ship (in high lunar orbit?). Launching<br>
from existing nations might be difficult (legally), while a launch from a<br>
private island can only be stopped with brute force (always a bit tricky in<br>
the age of omnipresent media coverage). Of course, the fact remains that<br>
in this scenario the private island is just a tool, and maybe not worth the<br>
effort. Maybe there are plenty of countries with no objections to private <br>
manned space launches, as long as you pay them. Then again, a private<br>
island might help to finance the space project if you make it into some <br>
sort of Las Vegas...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Primary goal: establish a permanent independent space habitat (a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Marsbase makes most sense for obvious reasons).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mars? Why not an asteroid? I have never liked gravity wells, too</i><br>
<i>&gt; little freedom.</i><br>
Because Mars:<br>
--is far enough from earth to avoid direct problems with its governments<br>
(it's too expensive/far/difficult to just send marines or nukes -- and you<br>
can see them coming for months) but is still near enough to reach by<br>
spaceship and to "stay in touch" with earthly developments (just a<br>
relatively small communications delay).<br>
--is a huge ball of raw material, with considerable value (with or without<br>
nanotech).<br>
--has a nice natural gravity well, something fleshy humans (unfortunately)<br>
need to prosper (i.e. need to avoid total degeneration). Of course uploading <br>
would elliminate this problem, but we don't know when this will be safely <br>
possible - could be as much as a hundred years. Besides, Mars is a good <br>
place for uploads too (see above).<br>
--has all the space to build your settlements (a whole planet can be devided <br>
between a couple of hundred/thousand people).<br>
--resembles somewhat our natural habitat (you can go "outside" for a <br>
walk etc.), which might help psychological adjustment.<br>
--is a very interesting place to visit from a scientific point of view.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But yes, I would happily support a project I think has a good chance</i><br>
<i>&gt; of creating a safe space habitat.</i><br>
Cool! :-)<br>
