---- From Intellectual to Guru ----<br>
<p>
You are an intelligent person and you have a deep understanding of the<br>
workings of the universe.  You look around and see fellow humans who<br>
don’t seem to have the same understanding and you want to help.  You<br>
talk with them, but they do not understand.  You need to find away to<br>
make them understand...<br>
<p>
---- Dogs &amp; Christians ----<br>
<p>
Dogs<br>
<p>
* He sits, holds his paws in the air as if to beg, eats the food, and<br>
acts eternally grateful.<br>
<p>
* He would never do anything against his master’s will, because he<br>
fears punishment.<br>
<p>
When you first get a dog, you don’t want to have to hit it, so you<br>
don’t.  But now and again you loose patients.  Clearly, you are the<br>
intelligent one and since the dog can not understand the meaning of<br>
your words, it’s up to you to lay down some rules. It’s customary to<br>
use a snack or treat to “reward” the dog and thus imprint certain<br>
concepts of “right” and “wrong” on the dogs mind.<br>
<p>
For the early part of the dog’s life these techniques will be used to<br>
train the dog to respect basic “house rules.”  To make sure they do<br>
not create unnecessary mess or harm others.  However, as the dog<br>
learns these basic rules it will become all to easy for you to impose<br>
other rules for purely your own convenience.  As time goes by you will<br>
impose new laws whenever you find the dog to be a nuisance.<br>
<p>
Christians<br>
<p>
* He sits, holds his hands together, gives thanks for the food, and<br>
then eats it.<br>
<p>
* He would never do anything against his master’s will, because he<br>
fears punishment.<br>

When you first meet a human, you don’t want to have to hit it, so you<br>
don’t.  But now and again use loose patients.  Clearly, you are the<br>
intelligent one and since the human cannot understand the meaning of<br>
your words, it’s up to you to lay down some rules.  It’s customary to<br>
use euphemisms to explain the necessity of these rules and thus<br>
imprint certain concepts of “right” and “wrong” on the human’s mind.<br>
<p>
For the early part of the human’s life these techniques will be used<br>
to train the human to respect society.  To make sure they do not<br>
create unnecessary mess or harm others. However, as the human learns<br>
these basic rules it will become all to easy for you to impose other<br>
rules for purely your own convenience.  As time goes by you will<br>
impose new laws whenever you find the human to be a nuisance.<br>

---- “My Little Pony” Ethics ----<br>
<p>
It has been said that Extropians have seen one too many “Star Trek”<br>
episodes based on “pleasure planets” where the entire population wears<br>
towels and preaches “kindness” and “love.”  Now, I’m not saying the<br>
world is a harsh place, it’s just much more interesting than some<br>
ethically whitewashed pleasure planet.<br>
<p>
In the disgustingly titled “Unbounding the Future” (porno for<br>
extropians) K. Eric Drexler applied his “my little pony” ethics<br>
(contrary to popular belief I’m not the originator of that phrase.)  I<br>
paraphrase, “I will not go into detail of the potential abuses of this<br>
technology.”  Which leaves the market for my forth coming “Nano War:<br>
The Definitive Guide to Global Destruction” wide open (featuring<br>
diagrams of actual nanoweapons.)<br>
<p>
Libertarians!  Can’t live with ‘em, ain’t no fun in killing ‘em (damn<br>
non-aggression!)<br>
<p>
---- Conclusion ----<br>
<p>
I’m just really glad I got my spellchecker working.<br>
