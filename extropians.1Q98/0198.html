I think it might be nice to have an Extropian organization that<br>
would perform functions similiar to the ACLU. i.e. fighting<br>
things that we think need to be fought. It could double as<br>
a lobbying organization.<br>
<p>
I see posts on this list all the time about how various<br>
governments pass stupid laws and otherwise trample on things<br>
that we like or want- why not try and fund our own organization<br>
for stopping these problems?<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This may be, tho' for me it is not so much that I am apprehensive about</i><br>

<i>&gt; particularly *like* a movement.  If it wants to be a "movement", I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; curious to see just what its agenda finally amounts to.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I am not sure if it makes much sense to think of extropianism as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;movement, given the forms it seems to exhibit most characteristically over</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;the five years or so I've been looking it over.  More like a constellation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;of spaces in which a group of people discuss certain idiosyncratic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;preoccupations (most of which I share)....</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think you are too close to it.  Step back and you will see the forest where</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; there were only trees.  You might also be able to see some of bad parts of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the movement, and help to make repairs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know what you mean when you say I am too close to it.  Certainly I</i><br>
<i>&gt; agree with you that this is a discussion about seeing the forest as well</i><br>
<i>&gt; as the trees.  I don't see how I'm diagnosing "bad parts" of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "movement," and I can't see how to recommend "repairs" when my question is</i><br>
<i>&gt; about what extropianism is functioning *as* in the first place.  As a</i><br>
<i>&gt; clearinghouse for ideas about technological development and life-extension</i><br>
<i>&gt; practices, extropian fora seem to function admirably well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; [snip]  What we need are people not to speak</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; out for a particular idea, but for "technology as good" for technotran-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; scendence, and growth.  Having an actor or actress do this would make</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the ideas reach even more people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Technology is good" is as good a transhuman slogan as WIRED's recent</i><br>
<i>&gt; "change is good" -- that is to say, it is no good at all.  Good technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; is good.  Foresight in the face of exponential technological development</i><br>
<i>&gt; is good.  Extropians seem to have a more robust sense than even most</i><br>
<i>&gt; conventional technophiles of just how sweeping technological</i><br>
<i>&gt; transformation may soon get (even if you are wary about the likelihood of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a singularity), and this puts us in a position to make a real difference</i><br>
<i>&gt; in preparing the world for these changes and ameliorating the worst of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; damage they might cause while embracing their benefits.  *This* insight is</i><br>
<i>&gt; worth building a movement around, imho.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A format that might come to mind is...  A child is dying of some hormone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; deficiency.  Clone sheep are producing the hormone through the wonders</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of genetic engineering.  Show this stuff in action.  Show the child living</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; another day.  Have the well known person read the copy and cry and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cheer at the appropiate moments.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This would likely be of benefit (although I have some issues about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; unquestioning instrumentalization of nonhuman animal species in scenarios</i><br>
<i>&gt; like this), but I fail in any case to see how it is more than incidentally</i><br>
<i>&gt; "extropian," if "extropian" denotes a movement with a discernible agenda</i><br>
<i>&gt; beyond broadly humanistic optimism with a background in sf.  How would</i><br>
<i>&gt; propaganda favorable to cloning connect up with right to die legislation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; competing security agencies, jupiter brains, and the like?  Cloning</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't need extropianism, except insofar as cloning is a stepping stone</i><br>
<i>&gt; toward something like a singularity.  This is why I agree with you that</i><br>
<i>&gt; this is a discussion about the forest *and* the trees where extropianism</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a movement properly so-called is concerned.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This might get a lot of the fence sitters on your side and the masses, who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; then can be used to bully politicians into not outlawing cloning.  It seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; worth a try.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't for the life of me figure out what fence-sitting amounts to in</i><br>
<i>&gt; regard to what extropians want *as extropians*.  Who are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fence-sitters?  Those who think the future won't happen? Those who don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; realize the changes are going to be big ones?  Or the ones who aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; actively in the labs and boardrooms doing the research and drumming up the</i><br>
<i>&gt; capital to incubate these changes?  By all means, it's worth trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep cloning legal in the face of unreasoning fear.  That would be a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing.  But is that enough on the face of it to make it an *extropian*</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing?</i><br>
