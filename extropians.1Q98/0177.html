<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Knowing that many others are already trying to do a good PR job, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; would like to  suggest trying to recruit a big name actor or actress to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the movement.  It sounds stupid, but it seems to work for a lot of other</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; movements, causes and ideas.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;But *is* extropianism a movement?  And if so what is it a movement</i><br>

<i>&gt;nanotechnology on the talk show circuit it is possible that more people</i><br>
<i>&gt;would sign up for the one, or would invest in the development of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;other...  but just how this would be an advance for extropianism as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;movement is unclear to me, unless we regard every scientific and</i><br>
<i>&gt;technological development, as well as every cultural and political</i><br>
<i>&gt;development in the direction of greater freedom and diversity, as an</i><br>
<i>&gt;advance for extropianism as a movement.  Does extropianism just mean</i><br>
<i>&gt;civilization, then?  </i><br>
<p>
I think there is a great deal of apprehension on this list toward the words<br>
"movement", "ideology" and the like.  I don't think it does much good to<br>
do all kinds of handwaving, denying, and neologizing to avoid such terms.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am not sure if it makes much sense to think of extropianism as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;movement, given the forms it seems to exhibit most characteristically over</i><br>
<i>&gt;the five years or so I've been looking it over.  More like a constellation</i><br>
<i>&gt;of spaces in which a group of people discuss certain idiosyncratic</i><br>
<i>&gt;preoccupations (most of which I share).  Usually stimulating, often</i><br>
<i>&gt;useful, sometimes deeply pleasurable, but a *movement*?</i><br>
<p>
I think you are too close to it.  Step back and you will see the forest where<br>
there were only trees.  You might also be able to see some of bad parts of<br>
the movement, and help to make repairs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Is it the goal of extropianism as a movement to expedite the arrival of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;technological singularity, or a particular configuration of future</i><br>
<i>&gt;technologies, perhaps by way of the information exchange that happens</i><br>
<i>&gt;here?  Is it the goal of the movement to insure that religious or</i><br>
<i>&gt;ecological fundamentalism don't manage to stifle development of a better</i><br>
<i>&gt;future?  Is the goal to disseminate as widely as possible the diversity is</i><br>
<i>&gt;good meme, so as to give pause to the first Powers that emerge if it</i><br>
<i>&gt;should occur to them that mehums look more like ubergoo feedstock for</i><br>
<i>&gt;their transhuman engineering projects than potentially valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt;conversational partners?  All of these would look like the agenda of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;movement about the future properly so-called.  Maybe having Demi Moore</i><br>
<i>&gt;talk about these things on Rosie or whatever would have a positive effect</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the kind you are talking about.  None of them seem to have enough of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;consistent articulate consensus behind them (except maybe the one about</i><br>
<i>&gt;fearing the damage fundies could do) as the conversations on our various</i><br>
<i>&gt;fora unfold, though, to suggest that they define the coherent agenda of an</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropian movement.  Not that I think extropianism necessarily *wants* to</i><br>
<i>&gt;aspire to movementhood, given the rather grisly track record of movements</i><br>
<i>&gt;in general in this century.  It's just that the term gets bandied about</i><br>
<i>&gt;quite a bit and I'm never completely sure why everybody seems so</i><br>
<i>&gt;comfortable with it.</i><br>
<p>
I think you look at it too piecemeal.  What we need are people not to speak<br>
out for a particular idea, but for "technology as good" for technotran-<br>
scendence, and growth.  Having an actor or actress do this would make<br>
the ideas reach even more people.<br>
<p>
A format that might come to mind is...  A child is dying of some hormone<br>
deficiency.  Clone sheep are producing the hormone through the wonders<br>
of genetic engineering.  Show this stuff in action.  Show the child living<br>
another day.  Have the well known person read the copy and cry and<br>
cheer at the appropiate moments.<br>
<p>
This might get a lot of the fence sitters on your side and the masses, who<br>
then can be used to bully politicians into not outlawing cloning.  It seems<br>
worth a try.<br>
