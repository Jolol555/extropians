<i>&gt; &gt;1) What is the difference between science and art anyway?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The goal of a fine artist is a personal expression or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;ideas based on personal experience with the human emotion. Science is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fact based, investigative study.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You have a good point but it isn't functional and most of art is functional.</i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, the architect has an idea, a vision, if you will.  She takes</i><br>
<i>&gt; her vision to the computer and begins designing the structure.  Her</i><br>
<i>&gt; mathematical computations must be accurate, and the suggested materials to</i><br>
<i>&gt; build the structure must be chosen carefully, the geological location for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the structure must be of a soil-texture that can afford the size and weight</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the structure.  If all the requirements meat the goals, then the</i><br>
<i>&gt; architects vision is realized and her space habitat on Titan is built.</i><br>
[...]<br>
<p>
I think you describe one very important part of art, which also works<br>
perfectly for science: First, there's an idea, and then a long -<br>
technical and conscious - way of making that idea come true. Still, I<br>
think there are other forms of art which are also quite interesting:<br>
With music, one interesting approach is simply playing around with it.<br>
Exploring sound. I would call this a more "intuitive" approach. That is:<br>
you don't consciously follow a concept. There's inspiration in the<br>
process of creation.<br>
<p>
The same could be done with photography I guess. The more complex art is<br>
to create, the harder this approach gets, though. With advanced Virtual<br>
Reality this might change: possibly one day, you'll be able to<br>
intuitively play around with different designs and experience them while<br>
you are creating them.<br>
<p>
Is there any good work about this available? Some definition of<br>
different types of art, like - let's say "intuitive art" and "functional<br>
art"? And maybe how wide-spread the different types are? This should be<br>
quite interesting!<br>
<p>
later,<br>
