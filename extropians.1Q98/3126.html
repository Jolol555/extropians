<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; include a role for lawyers </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, it _does_ include a role for lawyers ["full legal assistance but only </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; limited appeal possibilities,"] although they would be less powerful than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; they are now, just like most of the other members of the justice system. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; If one would be accused of a crime, he could hire as many people to *prove</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; his innocence* as he pleased/could afford. The role of the lawyer would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; in fact be streamlined: he must present sufficient hard evidence to prove</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; that his client didn't commit the crime(s) he's been accused of. No more,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; no less.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Guilty until proven innocent?  Are you sure that this is the standard </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you want to be ruled under?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, don't all (western) justice systems work like that: the prosecution</i><br>
<i>&gt; builds a case with evidence etc, and it's up to the lawyers to prove that</i><br>
<i>&gt; this is crap and that in fact you're innocent.</i><br>
<p>
That is not the methodology in England or the US or Canada;  I <br>
suspect it is not the methodology in former English colonies <br>
generally.  I won't comment on other countries because I don't have <br>
much information.<br>
<p>
In England, Canada, and the US, it is up to the prosecutor to prove <br>
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT that you are guilty.  In the US under <br>
current law, any person charged with a criminal offense has a right <br>
to a jury trial, and a jury verdict in a criminal trial must be <br>
unanimous.  (If it isn't, it is legally as if the trial never <br>
happened.  The prosecutor gets to decide if they can make a better <br>
case in front of a different jury -- not likely to try if the <br>
majority of the jury was voting for acquittal.)<br>
<p>
You don't have to prove you are innocent.<br>
<p>
If you can show that the prosecutor's facts are incorrect, the <br>
prosecution will probably fail (unless your showing also supports the <br>
prosecutor's basic claim -- "your honor, I didn't shoot the victim <br>
with that pistol, I used a different one.").<br>
<p>
If you can show that the prosecutor's facts are incomplete, and <br>
provide additional facts that show you are merely not particularly <br>
likely to be guilty (which is not the same as proving that you are <br>
innocent), the prosecution will probably fail.<br>
<p>
If you can show that the method by which the prosecutor acquired his <br>
facts is flawed, or that the source is for some reason unreliable, <br>
the prosecution may well fail depending on just how serious the flaws <br>
are -- even if you never claim that any specific fact in <br>
the prosecution's case is actually false.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I really see no difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The "presumed innocent until proven quilty" thing may sound o.k, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's nonsense of course. If the servants of justice really thought you were</i><br>
<i>&gt; innocent they wouldn't have arrested you in the first place, now would</i><br>
<i>&gt; they? They don't call them "suspects" for nothing.</i><br>
<p>
It's a balancing act, and it takes place in the courts, not in the <br>
police station.  Saying "innocent until proven guilty" is overstating <br>
the case a bit, perhaps: if the court truly held the accused to be <br>
strictly innocent, it would order his immediate release without bail <br>
pending verdict.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, if the prosecution presents no case at all, the <br>
defense wins.  If the defense presents no case at all, the <br>
prosecution must still present a case that the jury finds not merely <br>
credible, but true beyond a reasonable doubt, or the defense wins.  <br>
<p>
Once charges are brought against a person, if the prosecution delays <br>
things unduly the defense can have the case dismissed (effectively an <br>
automatic acquittal)  on that basis; but if the defense delays things <br>
unduly, there will NEVER be an automatic conviction.<br>
<p>
If the court finds the defendant guilty, the defendant can appeal.  <br>
If the court finds the defendant "not guilty" (there is no verdict of <br>
"innocent" in US courts), it's over, the defendant can never be <br>
compelled to face the same criminal charge for the same alleged <br>
crime, not even if he confesses in court immediately after the case.<br>
<p>
English courts, I understand, have three basic verdicts they can <br>
deliver: "guilty", "not guilty", and "not proven"; the latter amounts <br>
to "we think he's probably guilty, but the prosecutor didn't prove <br>
it; take another try if you like."  I don't know if I like the latter <br>
option or not.<br>
<p>
I know I don't like the requirement for unanimous verdicts.  A 5/6 <br>
majority should be sufficient for a guilty verdict, or a simple <br>
majority for a not-guilty verdict.  (However, in capital crimes, the <br>
death penalty *should* *not* be an option unless the verdict was <br>
unanimous.)<br>
