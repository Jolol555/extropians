This article appeared in the DowVision version of the Washington Post.<br>
My apologies for the length but its not a linkable article and I believe<br>
its significant enough to include in its entirety.<br>
<p>
Cost Force May Be Acting Against Gravity; Findings May Upset<br>
Theories of the Universe<br>
<p>
(Doug: I jokingly renamed this article "Lets see what John Baez<br>
does with this")<br>
<p>
The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, according to<br>
 startling new evidence suggesting that a mysterious antigravity<br>
force permeates "empty" space and is counteracting the pull of<br>
gravity on a cosmic scale.<br>
<p>
If the new results hold up, scientists said, they could have<br>
enormous ramifications for theories of cosmic evolution,<br>
resolving some conflicts and creating new ones as they<br>
reverberate through studies of the largest-scale structures in<br>
the cosmos and the smallest particles in nature, and the frustrating<br>
quest for a "theory of everything" that would unify those fields.<br>
<p>
Scientists have reacted to the findings with a mix of shock,<br>
amazement, horror, excitement and suspended disbelief.<br>
<p>
The question of the fate of the universe -- whether it will<br>
expand to infinity, contract in a "cosmic crunch" or flatline<br>
somewhere in between -- is one of the oldest and most<br>
controversial in cosmology.<br>
<p>
Most astronomers agree that the universe began in a Big<br>
Bang up to 15 billion years ago, when all of time and space<br>
were contained in a single dense point -- a singularity --<br>
which abruptly expanded outward in a fireball of particles.<br>
The most popular, and the simplest, Big Bang model holds<br>
that the resulting universe should contain exactly the "critical<br>
density" of matter required to keep it geometrically "flat," with<br>
just enough gravity to balance the outward momentum, slowing<br>
it down. The result: a cosmos coasting indefinitely on the<br>
verge of collapse.<br>
<p>
Instead, the new evidence indicates that stars and galaxies are<br>
flying apart in all directions at an ever-increasing rate -- thanks<br>
to an antigravity boost. This means there must be an unexpected<br>
mix of ordinary matter and some kind of unseen "dark matter"<br>
of an exotic nature. It also means, scientists said, that the far-flung<br>
universe of billions of years hence will seem dramatically more<br>
empty, dark and lonely.<br>
<p>
"This is nutty-sounding," said Robert Kirshner, of the Harvard-<br>
Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, a member of the international<br>
observing team. "But it's the simplest explanation for the data<br>
we've got."<br>
<p>
The findings, reported in today's issue of the journal Science,<br>
appear to bolster similar results presented last month by another<br>
international team using similar methods, all made possible only<br>
recently by powerful advances in observing technology. Still<br>
other researchers using different methods have reported that<br>
their data point in the same direction.<br>
<p>
The emerging picture of the universe represented in the spate<br>
of recent findings appears to reanimate a controversial concept<br>
known as the "cosmological constant," which Albert Einstein<br>
first proposed in his theory of general relativity. At the time, he<br>
introduced the notion of a repulsive force in space -- pushing<br>
objects apart -- to counterbalance the attractive force of gravity<br>
 -- pulling objects together -- to support his theory that the<br>
universe is static, neither expanding nor contracting. Observations<br>
soon showed that the universe is not static at all but, indeed,<br>
expanding. Einstein renounced the cosmological constant as his<br>
greatest blunder.<br>
<p>
But the concept has been kept around for use as what some<br>
call a "fudge factor" whenever it is needed to make theory and<br>
observation conform.<br>
<p>
"My own reaction is somewhere between amazement and horror,"<br>
said Brian Schmidt, of the Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring<br>
Observatory in Australia, leader of the group that reported the<br>
latest results, known as the High-z Supernova Search Team. It<br>
also includes scientists from the United States, Latin America and<br>
Europe. "Amazement, because I just did not expect this result,"<br>
he said, "and horror in knowing that [it] will likely be disbelieved<br>
by a majority of astronomers who, like myself, are extremely<br>
skeptical of the unexpected."<br>
<p>
Both the observing teams themselves and independent<br>
researchers emphasized that further observations are needed<br>
to ensure there is no other explanation for the data.<br>
<p>
Alan Guth, a leading cosmologist from the Massachusetts Institute<br>
of Technology, said the recent spurt of findings could pose a<br>
challenge to particle physicists like himself, who will have to<br>
explain this antigravity mechanism. They know that empty space<br>
is "enormously complex," he noted, with theories of "virtual"<br>
particles winking in and out of existence. But, he added, "The<br>
field is in a primitive state. . . . There certainly will be some thrashing<br>
about" as researchers try to explain the unexpected data.<br>
<p>
Physicists have theorized about "a whole Pandora's box of<br>
`repulsive stuff' " with names like "quintessence" and "X-matter,"<br>
Kirshner said.<br>
<p>
Whatever the antigravity mechanism is, said team member Adam<br>
Riess, of the University of California at Berkeley, "We're seeing<br>
the universe take off."<br>
<p>
The High-z team (like the other team that reported similar results<br>
last month, led by Saul Perlmutter of Lawrence Berkeley National<br>
Laboratory in California) studied variations in the brightness of<br>
very distant exploding stars, or supernovae, up to 7 billion light-years<br>
away to gauge how the rate of cosmic expansion has changed over<br>
time. They used the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based<br>
telescopes in Hawaii, Australia and Chile to analyze the gradual<br>
brightening and fading of the light arriving from each of more than<br>
a dozen supernovae.<br>
<p>
The astronomers found that "the dimness of the supernovae --<br>
pointing to unexpectedly great distances -- implies that cosmic<br>
expansion has actually sped up in the billions of years since the<br>
stars exploded," team member Alex Filippenko, of the University<br>
of California at Berkeley, told colleagues at a Los Angeles meeting<br>
last week.<br>
<p>
The High-z team, sometimes in tandem with the Perlmutter team,<br>
made what it called intense efforts to account for the dimness in<br>
other, less exotic ways, such as the effects of intervening dust in<br>
the cosmos or some intrinsic dimness in the most remote stellar<br>
explosions that make them unreliable yardsticks.<br>
<p>
They found no other explanation. Schmidt said the team concluded<br>
with a statistical confidence of between 98.7 percent and 99.99<br>
percent that cosmic expansion is getting an antigravity boost.<br>
<p>
"The thing that keeps you awake at night is worrying that you've<br>
done some stupid thing -- like forget about pi," Kirshner said.<br>
