Harvey Newstrom notes:<br>
<i>&gt;My partner and I have incorporated as an S-Corp.  We have 100 shares of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Stock in our future income stream.  We could sell these shares to anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;under any contract arrangements we wish.</i><br>
<p>
Cool.  But does this cover all future income, or just income earned via <br>
this corporation?  And is this a percentage of gross income, or only after<br>
certain "expenses" are deducted?  And could you contractually commit to<br>
retaining at least say 60% of your income shares, so buyers have reason<br>
to believe you will work hard?<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, bankruptsy is a bit too easy.  And people might reasonably<br>
fear that you were offering them this very unusual asset because you know<br>
something unusually disappointing about your future income prospects. <br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Um, economics does not say this.  Economic theory offers us many possible</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; explanation above is only one of many.  I think a more likely explanation</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is that no one has paid the start up costs to try to get a market like</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; this going.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That may be true, but an economic explanation should say why no one has</i><br>
<i>&gt;paid the start up costs. Is it not a profitable business (why not?) or has</i><br>
<i>&gt;no one thought of it?</i><br>
<p>
Every explanation will suggest these sorts of further questions.  And of course<br>
the plausibility of an explanation depends on how plausibly such questions are<br>
answered.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How a human capital market affects equality depends on what causes</i><br>
<i>&gt;inequality. If inequality is caused mainly by accidents affecting earning</i><br>
<i>&gt;potential, then such a market would increase equality. If inequality is</i><br>
<i>&gt;caused mainly by people having different discount rates for the future,</i><br>
<i>&gt;then such a market would decrease equality. </i><br>
<p>
Agreed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I had assumed that the latter is true, but I don't really have any </i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence either way. Are you aware of any research in this area? </i><br>
<p>
I know that there is lots of research, but I'm not really up on it.<br>
I will say that time discounts are probably not as good an explanation of <br>
differences across times, nations, or states than they might be across <br>
neighborhoods or within a family. <br>

<p>
Even if true, this is still be consistent with an equalizing effect.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is an important reason why such markets would increase inequality</i><br>
<i>&gt;- the people who can take advantage of this are the minority who are</i><br>

<i>&gt;will drop significantly, this market will dry up.</i><br>
<p>
If such markets for exchanging wage shares are begun well before there<br>
is a substantial risk of such a big shock, and for other reasons, then<br>
this is not such a problem.  Fortunately I can see benefits of such markets<br>
independent of insuring against an upload shock.<br>
