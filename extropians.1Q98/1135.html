<i>&gt;We are still who we've always been, even if we are machines.  But if we</i><br>

<i>&gt;machines.  If we are machines, then machines can experience things</i><br>
<i>&gt;subjectively, can feel emotions, can think, can contemplate, can do</i><br>
<i>&gt;everything we can do, and more.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think the hostility towards the idea that we are machines comes from</i><br>
<i>&gt;the low opinion people hold of machines, in general.  People tend to </i><br>
form<br>
<i>&gt;the category "machine" around the machines they have experienced, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;around the abstract idea of "machine" that computer scientists and</i><br>
<i>&gt;engineers use. The machines people use are fairly stupid and far from</i><br>
<i>&gt;sentient.  Calling us "machines" is insulting to those who only think </i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt;machines as they are today.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I suppose the popular opinion of machines will improve as the machines </i><br>
we<br>
<i>&gt;create improve. If we create highly sentient and loveable machines,</i><br>
<i>&gt;people might not mind being called "machines" any more.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think the key word here is setient. once something has become setient <br>
it has gone beyond machine or animal.  Machine is not a proper thing to <br>
label a human.  Because we as humans are more than machine or animal yet <br>
we are very much both.  When a computer becomes aware, it will become <br>
more than a machine, and most likely be insulted if we were to call it a <br>
machine.<br>
