Dick Armey is a conservative political pundit who is trying to make a name for<br>
himself in American politics.  He has no expertise in science nor, to my<br>
knowledge, does he have government-based counsel on scientific issues.  Armey<br>
has equally inane strategies for dealing with the United States income tax<br>
(which will never work but sound good on paper).  Armey is simply trying to<br>
seize an issue that the American public pay attention to in the hope that he<br>
can score some political brownie points.<br>
<p>
In my own opinion, anyone who has sufficiently research the human cloning issue<br>
would not take such alarmist stances as you see being taken by a variety of<br>
United States government officials.  In discussions, most people bring up the<br>
idea of cloning marginalizing the value of life and the notion of clone armies<br>
ravaging the world.  Given the low value human life has in general in the<br>
world, marginalizing it does not seem to be an important issue (this assuming<br>
that cloning would marginalize the value of life, which I think is the exact<br>
opposite of what would happen).  The objection of "clone armies" is absurd in<br>
my opinion.  You could also state that the Internet should be shut down since<br>
child pornography is transmitted over it, that guns should be outlawed since<br>
people use them to commit heinous crimes, that automobiles should be discarded<br>
since people speed in them and people die in accidents, etc. etc.  Every<br>
activity has potential negative consequences and can be abused.  Cloning is<br>
simply "spooky" to the average person.  "Spooky" and ignorance combined<br>
together creates "witch hunt".<br>
