This is a question of policy and economics about which people have <br>
opinions, not merely a matter of opinion.<br>
<p>
Your statement might make sense if tax proceeds, oxymoronically, went <br>
to support free markets, but they don't, and free markets don't need <br>
it. Commissions, at most, suffice there. The money that government <br>
expropriates instead goes into wasteful and disastrous programs that <br>
transfer wealth, distort markets, and create perverse incentives.<br>
<p>
Taxation is not *unfair*? That's the least of it. It's armed robbery,<br>
of which "unfair" is a very mild description.<br>
<p>
I could go on and on, and I expect others will.<br>
<p>
Oh, and as for Monaco -- I am sure a lot of us will opt out at some <br>
point. I can't see us carrying the clunky machinery of government into <br>
the far future, we can do MUCH better.<br>
