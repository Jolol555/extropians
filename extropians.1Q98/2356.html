Arjen Kamphius wrote 3/2/98 responding to my point that "fetal tissue" is a<br>
dehumanizing definition... propaganda developed against the enemy:<br>
<p>
&lt;What enemy? I'm sorry, but this sounds like you're picketing in front of a<br>
clinic or something (or maybe it's just my reli-fanatic-alarm going off?).&gt;<br>
<p>
Enemy?  Why, the mother's unborn child and how it's viewed, take your pick:<br>
as imperfection, denier of comfort, inconvenience, responsibility, the<br>
weak, life itself, etc.  What's wrong with picketing as a form of political<br>
activism?  Is human life not worth defending?  It's OK if your<br>
reli-fanatic-alarm went off, my kneejerk bigotry alarm went off in response<br>
to this, in fact, I think I heard the pilot light on the camp ovens turn<br>
on.<br>
<p>
&lt;Since the fetus at this stage is nearly indistinguisable from most other<br>
mammals and many other vertebrates that would mean that a pig fetus has the<br>
same value &amp; rights as a human, after birth the fetus somehow loses that<br>
value/those right and it's ok to use it as a source of protein.&gt;<br>
<p>
This may be true for very primitive humanity, but for many moons now,<br>
enlightened humanity can tell quite easily which is pig and which is human.<br>
 Do a web search on "human genome project, and in vitro fertilization" and<br>
follow the links if you don't believe me.  Also, regarding pig rights and<br>
sources of proteins, you might do a web search on "animal rights,<br>
bioethics, vegetarian, &amp; Jainism" and follow the links.  After a couple of<br>
years of in depth research on the topic, you may begin to see that the<br>
development of animals has been a political question for a very long time.<br>
<p>
Interestingly, the same groups that want animal rights typically support<br>
mothers murdering their unborn children.  Likewise, the same groups that<br>
lobbied to have alcohol and tobacco warnings for pregnancy typically<br>
support the right to murder what the warnings are meant to protect.  If a<br>
mother can murder her unborn child, why can't she smoke and drink to her<br>
heart's content without being warned about it?  Even the most hardcore<br>
ethical relativist has a twinge of conscience over the birth of crack<br>
babies, permanently maimed human beings, maimed in the area of volitional<br>
freedom.  Yet if a mother can murder her developing child, why can't she<br>
smoke all the crack she can afford?  If the unborn child is just fetal<br>
tissue, why not genetically engineer it in vitro or in utero to become a<br>
slave or worker drone?  Why not maim it deliberately, using worse methods<br>
than crack, just out of cussedness, that's freedom of choice isn't it? <br>
There will never be an anti-cloning or anti-designer baby law that will<br>
hold water with the Supreme Court until Roe v. Wade is overturned.  The<br>
right to murder an unborn baby because it has been defined away coincides<br>
with the right to use the baby however the mother wishes to use it.  They<br>
are inseparable.<br>
<p>
&lt;The parallel-server that I'm working on has no intelligence and thus no<br>
value&amp;rights as a consious being.&gt;<br>
<p>
I can't make sense out of this.  Are you saying that the possession of<br>
intelligence is the source of rights?  How much intelligence is enough to<br>
get on the rights wagon?  Who defines intelligence and why is it the same<br>
as consciousness?<br>
<p>
&lt;Maybe all it takes is a processor-upgrade and smarter software? That would<br>
mean that this 'lump of metal' is a potential consious being. O dear. What<br>
right do I have feeding it all these problems that I want to have solved.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is strange reasoning.  Where do you think rights come from?  If we are<br>
unconscious, say when we're sleeping or in a coma, do our rights go away?<br>
<p>
&lt;If everything that has the potential of becoming a human has the rights of<br>
a human then we're comitting mass-murder every time we have sex.&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't know who you are arguing against here, but it's certainly not me. <br>
A fertilized egg with a normal full set of chromosomes is the starting<br>
point for human development, not earlier.  At that point, with genetic<br>
engineering, we can modify what nature hath brought together.  The<br>
environmental factors that influence the whole development of a human begin<br>
right at this point, and it is these factors that produce a unique human<br>
entity every time, no matter how identical the raw material is to begin<br>
with.  The environmental factors are all political questions, e.g., smoking<br>
and alcohol advisory warnings for pregnancy.<br>
<p>
&lt;What's so special about that? lot's of cells contain a complete set (and a<br>
good thing they do!&gt;<br>
<p>
But I didn't specify any old cell, now did I?  What's the point of this<br>
comment?<br>
<p>
&lt;Ah yes, but the political conclusion that was reached in most modern<br>
countries was: "This is a choice the woman in question must decide for<br>
herself, after having been duly advised of the pro's and con's." or<br>
something like that. If you have an alternative, practical, model for<br>
deciding these things I'd love to hear it.&gt;<br>
<p>
In America, no political conclusion has been reached, only a judicial<br>
usurpation of the political question.  This is judicial tyranny, to define<br>
away human life without recourse to the Constitutional Amendment process,<br>
such as was used when slavery was abolished.  Slavery and abortion are all<br>
about the private ownership and disposition of human life.  The crux of the<br>
philosophical issues in both cases was and continues to be definitional. <br>
My alternative is polycentrism, or particularism, many jurisdictions trying<br>
out many different treatments of the issue.  The judiciary cannot usurp the<br>
legislative role.  Individuals should have the choice to move to<br>
jurisdictions that honor life, or that worship death.  The type of society<br>
that evolves in each jurisdiction will provide the incentive or<br>
disincentive for movement, but I know from moral reasoning from first<br>
principles that families trying to raise children will be drawn towards<br>
jurisdictions with an ethic of protecting and enhancing life.<br>
<p>
&lt;Fact is that after an abortion the remains of the fetus are usualy<br>
destroyed, a great waste since some of the tissue's have great medical<br>
potential. If destroying it is acceptable, why would medical use (with<br>
permission of course) not be?&gt;<br>
<p>
Why would permission be needed?  If the sewage treatment plant wants to<br>
make use of a mother's fecal material, no one expects it to ask for<br>
permission, and the fetal tissue in the eyes of the law is exactly<br>
equivalent to fecal matter.  Even better than medical use, why not eat them<br>
as gourmet delectables, like milk-fed veal with great nutritional value? <br>
What's wrong with cannabilism?  What's wrong with the Chinese Communists<br>
harvesting body organs without "permission" from prisoners they've bumped<br>
off and selling them on the world market?  What's wrong with<br>
commercializing all life, at all stages of development, including humans,<br>
intelligent or otherwise, conscious or otherwise?  Just make all life into<br>
products in the marketplace, all custom designed for any use whatsoever? <br>
"If destroying it is acceptable," why would any use not be, living or dead?<br>
