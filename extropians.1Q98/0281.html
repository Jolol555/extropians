Mark conflates morality and law.  I believe the two are distinct.  There are<br>
acts<br>
which are immoral which should not be illegal, such as smoking.  Smoking is<br>
self-destructive -- yet it should not be outlawed.  Under a rational morality,<br>
smoking would be wrong, but no police officer would come knocking at your<br>
door if you smoked.  Ditto for overeating, lack of exercise, most drug use.<br>
<p>
Rational morality cannot be forced.  It must be spread by persuasion.  The<br>
only time force can be used is when someone initiates or threatens to<br>
initiate force.  Then it is just a matter of defense or just retaliation.<br>
