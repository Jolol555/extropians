<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm seeing more and more conspiracy theories posted to the Extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; List.  TWA 800, Man arrested for child abuse just for spanking his son,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Microsoft evil empire, Gun Politics, Survivalism and Self Defense,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Avoiding Taxes, and now this.  They always seem to be posted without</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; comment or explanation.  Am I the only one who wonders what the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Extropian connection is?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; How about posting news of what sort of stuff may reall be going on that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; government and the media refuse to tell us. Its extropian in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; libertarian sense that we must take responsibility for keeping ourselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; informed of liberty related events, outside of government power monopoly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; channels.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; True. But I'm becoming a bit worried about the prevalence of</i><br>
<i>&gt; conspiracy thinking; it is alsmot the secular religion of the 90's. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost daily hear people explain things in the world around them by</i><br>
<i>&gt; references to conspiracies, and it seems to be the favored rhetorical</i><br>
<i>&gt; tool for anybody outside the direct political mainstream (sometimes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; it too) to explain the situation by some form of conspiracy (ranging</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the patriarchal to the statist to the market conspiracy).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; To me this is a sign of sloppy thinking. Sure, there are dirty</i><br>
<i>&gt; dealings and secret alliances out there, but that doesn't give</i><br>
<i>&gt; conspiracy theories explanatory power. A conspiracy theory usually</i><br>
<i>&gt; works by showing some suggestive but weak evidence, and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; explaining away the lack of confirmation by cover-up. It is</i><br>
<i>&gt; unfalsifiable ("Of course there are no witnessess, they have all been</i><br>
<i>&gt; scared into silence"), defends itself vigorously from criticism ("See?</i><br>
<i>&gt; They have indoctrinated you too!") and promotes spread (in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; help others see the truth). In short, they make very efficient memes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but they do not have to be true to spread well.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Of course. THings are getting to be like Renaissance Italy these days, where you<br>
had a bunch of city states all vying for power, the only real superpower was the<br>
vatican, which was ruled by corrupt people from corrupt influential families, and<br>
everybody spoke of conspiracies here and there due to the dearth of real<br>
informatiion sources that were reliable.<br>
<p>
I think that the prevalence of conspiracy gossip is indicativeof three things: a)<br>
that the mainstream media have abrogated their guardianship of the people against<br>
tyranny in return for favors and power from government, and that b) people with<br>
no prior capacity to have a public voice are in a toddler stage of development in<br>
the use of this voice, and c) people (meaning the middle class, which has been<br>
traditionally the bastion of the state) have lost faith in the political process.<br>
