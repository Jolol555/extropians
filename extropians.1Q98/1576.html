<p>
I've just started to re-read Prometheus Rising, and in fact, quite in<br>
the beginning he says that the 8 circuit model is just "for<br>
convenience". Since that particular model comes from Timothy Leary, and<br>
I may still have a few prejudices against Leary (because Albert Hoffmann<br>
critizised his "LSD-Propaganda" - for good reasons I would say), I was<br>
quite "careful" while reading about them.<br>
<p>
What fascinates me, is that without beeing too irrational, Wilson brings<br>
in the idea that there possibly are things that cannot be explained<br>
rationally. I once questioned pretty much everything, including the<br>
concept of science (without even knowing what I was doing... I just<br>
decided that it would be quite dumb to believe any single thing before<br>
critically thinking about it). My idea was that "science" is only<br>
possible with language, and language narrows your horizon extremely, so<br>
obviously, science has quite rigid limits.<br>
<p>
I didn't really follow that idea because I soon reached the point where<br>
I couldn't get any further (how should I (verbally) think and understand<br>
that language - which my thinking is heavily based on - is a bad model<br>
for reality). Besides, I have a million other things to do which at<br>
least promise bio-survival food-tickets ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And remember that any model which explains away attempts to</i><br>
<i>&gt; check it, especially by "ad hominem" explanations of why you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to check them, is very liable to contain mistakes or falsehoods</i><br>
<i>&gt; that are never corrected. Such defenses against falsification should</i><br>
<i>&gt; really be reasons to intensify scrutinity - what is the model hiding?</i><br>
<p>
That's perfect critical rationalism (my favorite epistemology). The<br>
question is: will critical rationalism reveal *all* information? Not at<br>
all - that's exactly what it's about. Maybe this finally helps me<br>
understand pancritical rationalism: would that allow saying<br>
"ok, here we have some knowledge which is ever increasing (hard<br>
science), but there, we have something we can't really deal with (for<br>
example because it doesn't allow falsification), so let's try making a<br>
use of it, even if its on another 'dimension' of knowledge"<br>
<p>
Understand 'dimension' in a strictly mathematical sense!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think the upper four circuits are not very well described (that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; of course understandable, since they are outside normal experience)</i><br>
<i>&gt; and unverified. The fifth circuit seems to have some basis in fact,</i><br>
<i>&gt; during my studies in various subjects I have run into it, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; uppermost three might just be recurring myths among psychonauts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing real or useful at all.</i><br>
<p>
Is there any physical way of brain/DNA-communication? I mean, some sort<br>
of "scanning" the DNA with your brain? I sometimes theorize, that by<br>
what we are (result of evolution + a lot of information), the DNA, and<br>
so the whole evolution is "within us". If you look at it from one<br>
perpective, it's totally obvious - we are the result of physical,<br>
biological and cultural evolution. It gets more interesting when you<br>
ask: is it possible for our conscious minds to get information about the<br>
previous evolutionary states by only "experiencing" the result? If that<br>
*is* possible, the 6th circuit makes sense... even though I can't<br>
imagine any 'practical' use right now ;-)<br>
<p>
Whatever, I'll see what I can do with the 5th circuit theory... I do<br>
feel like being on that circuit pretty often, but I don't meet the<br>
"haven't been sick for a long time"-criterion, yet (which seems the most<br>
useful quality of that circuit... among fascinating people with your own<br>
joy, which doesn't seem like a convincing proof for being on that<br>
circuit, though).<br>
