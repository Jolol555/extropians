<i>&gt; Subject: God</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Many extropians and other generally rational people label themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; "atheist", meaning that they don't believe in God.  Some go even further</i><br>
<i>&gt; and believe that there is no God.  Many atheists seem to be against the</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept of God in any form.  I've noticed many times on this list that</i><br>
<i>&gt; when the subject of God comes up, many atheists, in typical knee-jerk</i><br>
<i>&gt; fashion, renounce the whole idea, even though the God concept is</i><br>
<i>&gt; significantly different than standard God concepts.  I doubt this</i><br>
<i>&gt; rejection of all possible God concepts is rational.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My belief is that unless a theory is logically inconsistent or disagrees</i><br>
<i>&gt; with experiential evidence, then it cannot be rejected entirely.  Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course, theories with much supporting evidence should be considered more</i><br>
<i>&gt; applicable to reality than those with little or none.  But there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational basis for *rejecting* a theory without sufficient evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt; against it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is a huge variety of God concepts.  Probably the most familiar to</i><br>
<i>&gt; those on this list are the Judeao-Christian God concepts.  Many people,</i><br>
<i>&gt; including atheists, have a hard time thinking about God without using</i><br>
<i>&gt; these limited concepts.  But there are countless other ways to invent God</i><br>
<i>&gt; concepts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The idea that our universe was created by an intelligent being is very</i><br>
<i>&gt; attractive to most people.  Of course, that intelligent being could have</i><br>
<i>&gt; many possible characteristics and motivations.  Many atheists continue to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use the tired argument, "if there is a God, why all the suffering?",</i><br>
<i>&gt; without realizing that there is no connection between creating a universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; and ensuring that no suffering occurs within that system.  They have</i><br>
<i>&gt; placed the unnecessary restriction that God must care about suffering and</i><br>
<i>&gt; is able to do anything about it.  That's also true for their arguments</i><br>
<i>&gt; regarding omnipotence or omniscience.  *Some* people's Gods have those</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualities, but not every God concept includes God being omnipotent and</i><br>
<i>&gt; omniscient.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When atheists state there is no God, they are making a very bold,</i><br>
<i>&gt; unsupported claim, since there are so many possible variations on the God</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept.  I don't consider it rational to make such claims without any</i><br>
<i>&gt; supporting evidence or logical proofs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, I'm not saying there is a God; I have no idea.  But possibilities</i><br>
<i>&gt; are possibilities until proven otherwise.  I prefer not to close my mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; prematurely on any subject.  That way, I don't limit myself with my own</i><br>
<i>&gt; mental fixations.</i><br>
<p>
Most atheists base their atheism on the standard Judeo-Christian concept of God, which <br>
is a logical impossibility.<br>
<p>
But let's suppose you want to define "god" as some sort of intelligent being who created <br>
the Universe. Yes, that is possible. However, there is not a shred of evidence for that <br>
theory. I really don't have time to think about everything which might be possible. It <br>
is possible that there may be a planet in the Universe made of green cheese. My mind is <br>
not "closed" on any subject, but the burden of proof always lies with the person who <br>
claims something is true.<br>
<p>
Also, if there is some sort of "god", I'm really not interested in this entity unless <br>
you can show me that he can do something useful for me at the present time. <br>
