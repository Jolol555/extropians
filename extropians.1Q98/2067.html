Eating cannabis can be tricky, though, because it's tougher to control the <br>
dosage this way and you might get a bad trip (or no trip). Vaporizing is a <br>
much quicker and more controllable way to get high (vaporizing tends to <br>
get you high, while smoking has a more "stoned" effect), although it's true <br>
that if you want a truly profound, smooth trip Shiva Bhang balls (small balls <br>
of cannabis mush and some other herbs - an Indian specialty) are probably <br>
better than vaporizing. Another advantage of these balls, that are chewed a <br>
bit and then swallowed, is that they can be used discretely (unlike smoked <br>
pot, that can be detected from a mile away...) <br>
