<p>
&lt;&lt; Er, isn't this a bit of an over-simplification? I am not an astrophysicist,<br>
 however I vaguely recall reading a fair bit lately about head-scratching<br>
 over the initial era of expansion, and some suggestions (does the name<br>
 Linde mean anything?) that it was driven by a one-off particle which<br>
 subsequently disappeared behind an event horizon, creating yet another<br>
 universe, to repeat the process all over again ad infinitum &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
I missed that part.<br>
<p>
But it seems to me that there is quiet a bit of "stretching" going on.  <br>
<p>
Eric Lerner in "The Big Bang Never Happened" provided a logical (to me)<br>
alternative explanation to the physical evidence that is purported to identify<br>
black holes...that is...trans galactic electrical currents producing enormous<br>
magnetic fields which cause the same effects as Quasars...(massive energy<br>
release...jets..etc)...<br>
<p>
And I still don't get how it's ok for faster than light "expansion" then but<br>
not now.<br>
<p>
Or how conservaton of mass energy  applies to anything which exits the<br>
universe thereby making the universe a NON closed system.  Be it the purported<br>
black holes...of quantum fluctuations producing  hydrogen nucluei one at a<br>
time...evenly spaced everywhere...etc...<br>
