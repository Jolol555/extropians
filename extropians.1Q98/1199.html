<i>&gt;&gt; From:          "Michael M. Butler" &lt;butler@comp*lib.org&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Also a country where they celebrate a double-edged patsy-terrorist by</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; blowing up fireworks and singing ambiguous songs about blowing up Parliament.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Of course, they burn Guy Fawkes in effigy too, now don't they?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I asked a British friend if they burned Mr. Fawkes in effigy to </i><br>
<i>&gt; denounce his intentions...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; or to bemoan his incompetence.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; He thought it was an interesting question, but didn't answer.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
     At the 'Freedom Association' in 1979, when I worked there, the <br>
     Research Chief had a poster on his Office wall:<br>
      <br>
     It showed a caped Guy Fawkes with cherry-bomb, and carried the legend:<br>
      <br>
     "Guy Fawkes: the only man to enter Parliament with honest intentions"<br>
      <br>
     According to founder Brian Crozier's later-published autobiography  <br>
     'Free Agent', the 'Freedom Association' was a joint MI6/CIA project...<br>
     <br>
     Both organizations had and have _extensive_ experience in <br>
     overthrowing unloved governments...   &gt;:-}<br>
