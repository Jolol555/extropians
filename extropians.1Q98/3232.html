 Not with a primarily economic argument. But an emphasis on how the<br>
problems with catching runaway slaves motivated the slaveholders to<br>
erode the right to a fair trial which everyone else valued would<br>
probably have done less to create a bloody war than the absolutist<br>
rhetoric they actually used.<br>

 That clearly argues for a rule that discourages theft, but does it<br>
argue for a religious type rule, or does it argue for a belief more<br>
like "theft penalizes everyone by forcing them to spend more defending<br>
against theft"? Probably depends on how smart the people you're trying<br>
to sell the rule to are.<br>
