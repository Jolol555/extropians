<i>&gt; &gt; v. U.S._ 485 U.S. 58, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988) (Rhenquist,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; C.J.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; MY NOTE: This means that a defendant can deny that he committed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; crime, and then claim that the reason he committed it was because he</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; was entrapped. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The law is full of strange loops like this, but this one can also be</i><br>
<i>&gt; unravelled less strangely (and less entertainingly): "My client denies</i><br>
<i>&gt; participating in the act in question, but even if the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; perpetrator were here on trial, the prosecution's case is tainted by</i><br>
<i>&gt; entrapment."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or, heavier on the sarcasm, "The prosecution's case is missing two</i><br>
<i>&gt; key elements -- one, the right defendant; and two, evidence of any </i><br>
<i>&gt; wrongdoing that is not the result of entrapment." </i><br>
<p>
Lawyers frequently argue in the alternative.  One excellent example <br>
(I don't know if it's real or not) involved a person being sued for <br>
borrowing an item and then returning it badly damaged.<br>
<p>
The defense was (a) the defendant never borrowed the item, (b) the <br>
defendant returned the item in perfect condition, and (c) the item <br>
was already damaged when the defendant borrowed it.<br>
<p>
If the defense could convince the court that any *one* of these <br>
things was true, the court should find for the defendant.<br>
