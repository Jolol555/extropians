I think we disagree on what constitutes child abuse. I do not consider a <br>
few whacks on the butt after a kid has just about killed a cat (an <br>
action that I believe would be considered a crime in all states) to be <br>
abuse. Now if this father hits his kid 5 times a day for any old reason, <br>
well, then I might agree with you. <br>
<p>
I also believe that parents should have broad discretion regarding how <br>
they raise their kids, not because they are stronger , but because they <br>
are paying the bills! If that includes an occasional whack on the butt, <br>
I'm not going to interfere. <br>
 <br>

<p>
Well, were you wrong? If so, I guess being hit was not effective. When I <br>
got belted, it was always for a good reason and it impressed on me (pun <br>
intended) the fact that if I misbehaved there would be unpleasant <br>
consequences. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In the example that Mark D. Fulwiler used, of a kid kicking a cat into</i><br>
<i>&gt; unconsciousness, we should ask Why did the kid think this would</i><br>
<i>&gt; "work" as a solution to not getting his way?  I think it is because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; kid was spoiled already.  I've noticed that parents who abuse tend</i><br>
<i>&gt; also to spoil.  They go through cycles of heavy abuse and spoiling</i><br>
<i>&gt; permissiveness, often because they feel guilty about the abuse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The child then grows up with unreal expectations -- he or she does</i><br>
<i>&gt; not know if any encounter will be injurious or indulgent.</i><br>
<p>
Well, maybe. However, there are excellent parents who sometimes have <br>
problem children despite their best efforts. I would be interested in <br>
why the kid kicked the cat, but wouldn't you agree that the kid should <br>
get some punishment (and a severe one at that) for this really vile act? <br>
Shouldn't actions have consequences? If not, I'm afraid this awful <br>
little kid may be in Juvenile Hall at age 14 for murder.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I believe a few books have been written on these phenomena.</i><br>

If you can cite one, I'd appreciate it.<br>
