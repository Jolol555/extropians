<i>&gt; One thing that has some people worried is China becoming a huge</i><br>

<i>&gt; driving cars, then the impact on the environment may be a little messy. </i><br>
<i>&gt; A story I read in Business Week said an automobile-centered Chinese</i><br>

<i>&gt; it.  I haven't put any math to it, so this is just anecdote.</i><br>
<p>
This is very widespread idea, but there is something wrong with it. If<br>
all chinese used cars, then they would not afford gasoline - or they<br>
would have to find a cheaper substitute. Overall I think this fear is<br>
based on linear extrapolation: if we have a certain standard of living<br>
producing a certain level of pollution, then if X times us chinese<br>
have the same standard they will produce X times as much<br>
pollution. The fallacy is the assumption that they develop *identical*<br>
systems, without learning anything from mistakes and without trying to<br>
improve them.<br>
<p>
"But Grog, if there really will be *millions* of people in the future<br>
as you say, then there won't be enough caves, and their cooking-fires<br>
will produce so much smoke that it will cause a new ice age."<br>
<p>
This seems unlikely, the chinese seem to be quite good at modifying<br>
foreign ideas for their own use. Advanced technology as a rule is less<br>
polluting than less advanced, so it would be a good thing<br>
environmentally speaking to encourage the chinese to use the most<br>
efficient methods available, giving/selling them our know-how.<br>
