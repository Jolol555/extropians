I agree with you 100%, I often have 'lively' discussions with my<br>
'left-wing-liberal' friends about this. In my view anybody who wants to<br>
consume animals should at least be _willing_ to do some of the killing<br>
him/herself (I realize that the actual killing of animals for consumption<br>
might not always practical in society today). It's the principal that matters.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I approve of abortion, the death penalty, the right to suicide, legality of</i><br>
<i> &gt;assisted suicide, self defense with deadly weapons, and the hunting of and</i><br>
<i> &gt;consumption of animals. At least someone here is consistent.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not against the death-penalty in principal but as I see it it's<br>
preventative effects on society as a whole are unclear (and I believe that<br>
a justice system should be based on prevention rather than revenge). Other<br>
than that I more or less argee with you.<br>

How do you know that all woman who have abortions view their child as an<br>
enemy? Do think they walk away from an abortion smiling, saying: gotcha! I<br>
think it's a little more complex than that (understatement of the century).<br>

<p>
I don't think comparing womans clinics to nazi-death camps is appropriate.<br>
Have you ever been present at an abortion or seen a concentrationcamp?<br>
There's plenty of opportunity of both around the world. I suggest that<br>
untill you have you stop making these kind of comparisons. Certain people<br>
on this list might get extremely upset.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&lt;Since the fetus at this stage is nearly indistinguisable from most other</i><br>
<i> &gt;mammals and many other vertebrates that would mean that a pig fetus has the</i><br>
<i> &gt;same value &amp; rights as a human, after birth the fetus somehow loses that</i><br>
<i> &gt;value/those right and it's ok to use it as a source of protein.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;This may be true for very primitive humanity, but for many moons now,</i><br>
<i> &gt;enlightened humanity can tell quite easily which is pig and which is human.</i><br>
<i> &gt;Do a web search on "human genome project, and in vitro fertilization" and</i><br>
<i> &gt;follow the links if you don't believe me.</i><br>
<p>
I think you will find that most listmembers are very much aware of<br>
technologies like IVF and genetic engineering. The existance of these<br>
technologies does not change the ethics one bit. From the perspective of<br>
the fetus it is irrelevant whether it is a pig or a human, up to a point.<br>
And somewhere before this point abortion becomes illegal. The fetus now has<br>
the status of human with all the usual rights attached.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Also, regarding pig rights and</i><br>
<i> &gt;sources of proteins, you might do a web search on "animal rights,</i><br>
<i> &gt;bioethics, vegetarian, &amp; Jainism" and follow the links.  After a couple of</i><br>
<i> &gt;years of in depth research on the topic, you may begin to see that the</i><br>
<i> &gt;development of animals has been a political question for a very long time.</i><br>
<p>
Nonetheless, most people have no problems with the killing of animals for<br>
consumption. This does not make it ok but it's evilness is, to say the<br>
least, debatable.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Interestingly, the same groups that want animal rights typically support</i><br>
<i> &gt;mothers murdering their unborn children.</i><br>
<p>
Don't hold me (or anyone on this list) responsable for opinions I do not<br>
share.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Likewise, the same groups that</i><br>
<i> &gt;lobbied to have alcohol and tobacco warnings for pregnancy typically</i><br>
<i> &gt;support the right to murder what the warnings are meant to protect.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. They supported the possibility for each mother to make an informed<br>
decicion for herself (and what could _possibly_ be wrong with that?).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;If a</i><br>
<i> &gt;mother can murder her unborn child, why can't she smoke and drink to her</i><br>
<i> &gt;heart's content without being warned about it?</i><br>
<p>
She can. Ultimately it's her responsability. Nobody can stop her (legally<br>
or technically).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Even the most hardcore</i><br>
<i> &gt;ethical relativist has a twinge of conscience over the birth of crack </i><br>
<i> &gt;babies, permanently maimed human beings, maimed in the area of volitional</i><br>
<i> &gt;freedom. Yet if a mother can murder her developing child, why can't she</i><br>
<i> &gt;smoke all the crack she can afford? If the unborn child is just fetal</i><br>
<i> &gt;tissue, why not genetically engineer it in vitro or in utero to become a</i><br>
<i> &gt;slave or worker drone? </i><br>
<p>
As long as you keep clouding the issue by calling abortion 'murder' this is<br>
not going anywhere. And why in the hell would we want to create drones?<br>
(even if we could). We need more smart people, not stupid ones.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Why not maim it deliberately, using worse methods</i><br>
<i> &gt;than crack, just out of cussedness, that's freedom of choice isn't it?</i><br>
<p>
Yes it is and neither you nor I nor all the laws in the world can chance<br>
this. It's the responsibility of the mother.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;There will never be an anti-cloning or anti-designer baby law that will</i><br>
<i> &gt;hold water with the Supreme Court until Roe v. Wade is overturned. The</i><br>
<i> &gt;right to murder an unborn baby because it has been defined away coincides</i><br>
<i> &gt;with the right to use the baby however the mother wishes to use it. They</i><br>
<i> &gt;are inseparable.</i><br>
<p>
B.S. (pardon my French). Aside from the fact that I'm not specifically<br>
looking forward to a anti-cloning law, it's perfectly feasable to have a<br>
law allowing abortion to a certain number of weeks after conception. I know<br>
this because we have such a law in the Netherlands.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&lt;The parallel-server that I'm working on has no intelligence and thus no</i><br>
<i> &gt;value&amp;rights as a consious being.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I can't make sense out of this. Are you saying that the possession of</i><br>
<i> &gt;intelligence is the source of rights?</i><br>
<p>
The ability to have Intelligence &amp; consiousness.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;How much intelligence is enough to</i><br>
<i> &gt;get on the rights wagon? Who defines intelligence and why is it the same</i><br>
<i> &gt;as consciousness?</i><br>
<p>
Killing a fly, fish or cow seems to be no ethical problem to most humans,<br>
killing a chimp is more difficult and only allowable for very specific<br>
medical research, killing a human unnaceptable unless in a self-defense<br>
situation. I _think_ most people will agree on this.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Maybe all it takes is a processor-upgrade and smarter software? That would</i><br>
<i> &gt;mean that this 'lump of metal' is a potential consious being. O dear. What</i><br>
<i> &gt;right do I have feeding it all these problems that I want to have solved.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;This is strange reasoning. Where do you think rights come from? If we are</i><br>
<i> &gt;unconscious, say when we're sleeping or in a coma, do our rights go away?</i><br>
<p>
Of course not! If a machine was smart enough to pretend it's a human over<br>
E-mail or the phone (passes the Turing test) then pulling the plug would<br>
have to involve some ethical debate. All consious beings should be treated<br>
with respect whether they are humans, dolphins or computers.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;If everything that has the potential of becoming a human has the rights of</i><br>
<i> &gt;a human then we're comitting mass-murder every time we have sex.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I don't know who you are arguing against here, but it's certainly not me. </i><br>
<i> &gt;A fertilized egg with a normal full set of chromosomes is the starting</i><br>
<i> &gt;point for human development, not earlier.</i><br>
<p>
Why?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;At that point, with genetic</i><br>
<i> &gt;engineering, we can modify what nature hath brought together.</i><br>
<p>
also before that and after that. What's new? <br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The</i><br>
<i> &gt;environmental factors that influence the whole development of a human begin</i><br>
<i> &gt;right at this point, and it is these factors that produce a unique human</i><br>
<i> &gt;entity every time, no matter how identical the raw material is to begin</i><br>
<i> &gt;with. The environmental factors are all political questions, e.g., smoking</i><br>
<i> &gt;and alcohol advisory warnings for pregnancy.</i><br>
<p>
And in all these matter the woman in question decides (who else?).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&lt;What's so special about that? lot's of cells contain a complete set (and a</i><br>
<i> &gt;good thing they do!&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;But I didn't specify any old cell, now did I?  What's the point of this</i><br>
<i> &gt;comment?</i><br>
<p>
I meant to point out that with the current state of technology the<br>
difference between a fertilized egg-cell and many other cells does not have<br>
to be a fundamental one.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&lt;Ah yes, but the political conclusion that was reached in most modern</i><br>
<i> &gt;countries was: "This is a choice the woman in question must decide for</i><br>
<i> &gt;herself, after having been duly advised of the pro's and con's." or</i><br>
<i> &gt;something like that. If you have an alternative, practical, model for</i><br>
<i> &gt;deciding these things I'd love to hear it.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;In America, no political conclusion has been reached, only a judicial</i><br>
<i> &gt;usurpation of the political question.</i><br>
<p>
This shot is too easy to make (it's also pretty cheap) and since I<br>
admire&amp;respect many listmembers I won't make it.<br>
I'll just say that sex-education &amp; certain legislation may be leave<br>
something to be desired in the US (Maybe if the sex-education was a bit<br>
better most abortions would never be neccecary in the first place; prevent<br>
&amp; solve, don't illegalize).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;This is judicial tyranny, to define</i><br>
<i> &gt;away human life without recourse to the Constitutional Amendment process,</i><br>
<i> &gt;such as was used when slavery was abolished. Slavery and abortion are all</i><br>
<i> &gt;about the private ownership and disposition of human life.</i><br>
<p>
Depends on your defenition of human life. By law &amp; consesus an fertalized<br>
egg is not a human, a fetus more than a certain number of weeks is.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;My alternative is polycentrism, or particularism, many jurisdictions trying</i><br>
<i> &gt;out many different treatments of the issue.</i><br>
<p>
That's what's happening. In most western countries abortion is more or less<br>
legal, not in all countries however (Ireland, the Vatican). Move to the<br>
Vatican if you want, don't expect me to follow.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The judiciary cannot usurp the</i><br>
<i> &gt;legislative role. Individuals should have the choice to move to</i><br>
<i> &gt;jurisdictions that honor life, or that worship death.</i><br>
<p>
They do (or is thee some law that forbids you to emigrate?)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The type of society</i><br>
<i> &gt;that evolves in each jurisdiction will provide the incentive or</i><br>
<i> &gt;disincentive for movement, but I know from moral reasoning from first</i><br>
<i> &gt;principles that families trying to raise children will be drawn towards</i><br>
<i> &gt;jurisdictions with an ethic of protecting and enhancing life.</i><br>
<p>
If you have a 14 year old daughter who is raped by someone with a genetic<br>
defect and becomes pregnant would you rather live in a 'jurisdiction' that<br>
totally illegalizes abortion or in one here your daughter can decide to<br>
have one (or not) for herself?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&lt;Fact is that after an abortion the remains of the fetus are usualy</i><br>
<i> &gt;destroyed, a great waste since some of the tissue's have great medical</i><br>
<i> &gt;potential. If destroying it is acceptable, why would medical use (with</i><br>
<i> &gt;permission of course) not be?&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Why would permission be needed? If the sewage treatment plant wants to</i><br>
<i> &gt;make use of a mother's fecal material, no one expects it to ask for</i><br>
<i> &gt;permission, and the fetal tissue in the eyes of the law is exactly</i><br>
<i> &gt;equivalent to fecal matter.</i><br>
<p>
You stated earlier that there was no real law in this area in the US. Too<br>
bad. IN many other countries there is and there is a _very_ clear<br>
distiction between an aborted fetus and human excrement.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Even better than medical use, why not eat them</i><br>
<i> &gt;as gourmet delectables, like milk-fed veal with great nutritional value? </i><br>
<p>
Yeah, that's right. let's keep the discussion rational and stuctured.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;What's wrong with cannabilism?</i><br>
<p>
Nothing (did you see 'Alive'). The problem is the killing part, not the<br>
eating part.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;What's wrong with the Chinese Communists</i><br>
<i> &gt;harvesting body organs without "permission" from prisoners they've bumped</i><br>
<i> &gt;off and selling them on the world market?</i><br>
<p>
I suggest you debate the ethical nature of the Chinese penal system with<br>
someone who's more 'pro death-penalty' than I am. The ethical problem in my<br>
view is not the organ harvesting but the execution of 30.000 people yearly<br>
for things that should not be criminal in the first place (political<br>
activity, drug use, distribution of porn...).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;What's wrong with</i><br>
<i> &gt;commercializing all life, at all stages of development, including humans,</i><br>
<i> &gt;intelligent or otherwise, conscious or otherwise?  Just make all life into</i><br>
<i> &gt;products in the marketplace, all custom designed for any use whatsoever? </i><br>
<i> &gt;"If destroying it is acceptable," why would any use not be, living or dead?</i><br>
<p>
See above, a baby gains certain rights beyond a specific number of weeks<br>
after conception. This is not perfect from an ethical viewpoint, but it is<br>
workable.<br>

<p>
I know this is tricky terrain. Imagine the following situation:<br>
A person has a brain/nerve disorder that could become lethal in 2 years<br>
orso, there is no cure. With an implant of compatible fetal nervetissue the<br>
person could be saved. Would it be unethical if the persons sister became<br>
pregnant only to provide such material? And could you explain to this<br>
person why?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;But what if we can manufacture the genes and tissues in pig fetus ?</i><br>
<p>
That's the solution I'm for in the near-future. This would solve many<br>
ethical problems (IMHO) concerning transplantation. For now however, we<br>
have to make due with messier solutions (and try to find some ethical<br>
answer for them).<br>
