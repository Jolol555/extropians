My point though was research in one area might help in others.<br>

<i>&gt;transplants help, but not much. But animal studies show that nerve</i><br>
<i>&gt;grafts can do some amazing things (turning and growing in the right</i><br>

<i>&gt;to be hopeful. I don't know if anybody has yet looked at what happens</i><br>
<i>&gt;if you implant totiopotent cells as regarding to aging.</i><br>
<p>
It would be very interesting work.  The test design would seem simple<br>
enough.  Skin might be easiest to work with, since it is on the surface.<br>
For instance, taking totipotent cells, grafting them to a skin site and<br>
seeing how they differentiate under the influence of hormones...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I was under the impression that gene therapy was already being done</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with genetically engineered cells which provided products directly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; inside/to the body.  I see no principled reason why this can't be done</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; for hormones or Vitamin C or what have you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That should work. The problem might be where to put them, but for</i><br>
<i>&gt;substances that are very bioactive not many cells are needed. One fun</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibility is otherwise to use engineered gut bacteria - they produce</i><br>
<i>&gt;vitamin K, so why not C?</i><br>
<p>
Actually, a friend (Brett, are you out there?) and I discussed such with gut<br>
bacteria a few years ago.  He thought it wouldn't happen because<br>
bacteria share DNA too easily, making it hard to sell.  However, if we don't<br>
care about that all that much, then why not?<br>
