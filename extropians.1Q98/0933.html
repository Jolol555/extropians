I disagree.  I quote David Friedman's definition of government from his<br>
_The Machinery of Freedom_:<br>
<p>
"A government is an agency of legitimized coercion.  I define 'coercion',<br>
for the purposes of this definition, as the violation of what people in a<br>
particular society believe to be the rights of individuals with respect to<br>
other individuals.<br>
<p>
"For instance, people in this society believe that an individual has the<br>
right to turn down a job offer; the denial of that right is a form of<br>
coercion called enslavement.  They believe that an individual has the right<br>
to turn down a request for money or an offered trade.  The denial of that<br>
right is called robbery or extortion.<br>
<p>
"Government is an agency of legitimized coercion.  The special<br>
characteristic that distinguishes governments from other agencies of<br>
coercion (such as ordinary criminal gangs) is that most people accept<br>
government coercion as normal and proper.  The same act that is regarded as<br>
coercive when done by a private individual seems legitimate if done by an<br>
agent of the government.<br>
<p>
"If I yell 'Stop, thief!' at a stickup man escaping with my wallet, the<br>
bystanders may or may not help, but they will at least recognize the<br>
reasonableness of my act.  If I yell "Stop, thief!" at an employee of the<br>
Internal Revenue Service, leaving my house after informing me that he has<br>
just frozen my bank account, my neighbors will think I'm crazy.<br>
Objectively, the IRS is engaged in the same act as the thief.  It seizes my<br>
resources without my permission.  True, it claims to provide me with<br>
services in exchange for my takes, but it insists on collecting the taxes<br>
whether or not I want the services.  It is perhaps, a fine point whether<br>
that is robbery or extortion.  In either case, if it were the act of a<br>
private party, everyone would agree that it was a crime."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The hope of Extropians is to make our semi-mutual agreements more</i><br>
<i>&gt;beneficial to all involved.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, your "semi-mutual agreements" sound an awful lot like coercion to<br>
me.  I reason that if gov't exchanges were genuinely mutual, then any<br>
private citizen could run a state based on mutual agreements.  However,<br>
much of the time they are not mutual; by definition, exchanges which are<br>
not mutually agreed upon by all participants are coercive.<br>
<p>
I don't seek to make "semi-mutual agreements" more beneficial; rather I<br>
seek to eliminate coercion through Intelligent Technology.<br>
