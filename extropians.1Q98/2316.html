I think you've got it the wrong way round. Tech R&amp;D for a deep space<br>
mission implies huge funding devoted to solving small problems -- an<br>
Apollo-style program. But the private capital doesn't exist for such a<br>
program, and the political will isn't there either. The spin-offs you<br>
mention are usually the commercialization of prototype ideas developed<br>
for solving specific problems on a money-is-no-object basis.<br>
<p>
Yes, my life is better because of velcro, pocket calculators, medical<br>
telemetry, teflon, hang gliders, and all the other things that showed up<br>
in the wake of the apollo R&amp;D loading. But I suspect we'd have got them<br>
without the $25Bn price tag in any event.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (perfected suspended animation, which would make the trip dramatically </i><br>

<i>&gt; example)</i><br>
<p>
Now you're assuming suspended animation _can_ work for something like<br>
a human being. Given that no other anthropoid demonstrates hibernation,<br>
I hope you'll excuse me for being sceptical about the prospects of<br>
a decent suspended animation system suitable for space travel being<br>
developed using current medical techniques. (I'll grant you Drexler's<br>
vitrification proposal, but I'm talking about something you can achieve<br>
using drugs or surgical procedures to lower the human metabolic rate<br>
and induce narcolepsy for a substantial period.)<br>
<p>
In fact, if you want to reduce the oxygen/food consumption of astronauts<br>
on a voyage to Mars, probably your best solution is to give them a<br>
comfortable sofa and a wide-screen TV set -- I believe human metabolic<br>
rates when watching TV are not much higher than those measured during <br>
sleep!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; *and* it would almost certainly give an impulse to governmental</i><br>
<i>&gt; space programs (a matter of ego, paranoia and greed), which would in</i><br>
<i>&gt; turn produce even more useful spinoffs. Once on Mars, the motivation </i><br>
<i>&gt; to develop new technologies would be much higher, because you need</i><br>
<i>&gt; high tech to survive &amp; prosper, while on earth the situation is somewhat</i><br>
<i>&gt; less urgent. </i><br>
<p>
But on Mars, the cost of _not_ starting off with the tools for self-<br>
sufficient survival is certain death. Developing new technologies will<br>
probably take a long-term back seat to churning out replacements for<br>
parts that are wearing out, and working down in the dome-covered farm<br>
to produce food! I'd expect a Mars colony to begin making valuable<br>
contributions to technology a generation or so after its foundation --<br>
but there's a fairly long-term investment required leading up to that<br>
point, to build up a margin beyond bare survival.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, there wouldn't (initially) be much else to do then to</i><br>
<i>&gt; develop new ways to make life more comfortable.</i><br>
<p>
What? No TV? ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since you have your</i><br>
<i>&gt; "spies" (mechanical/human) on earth you don't have to miss out on new</i><br>
<i>&gt; developments, on the contrary, new technologies can be implemented</i><br>
<i>&gt; much more rapidly because the laws on Mars are presumably liberal, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and there's more than enough room to test potentially dangerous new</i><br>
<i>&gt; stuff etc.</i><br>
 <br>
Again: I expect laws on Mars to be draconian -- laws enforced by the<br>
fact that there's about 0.01 atmospheres of freezing cold CO2 on the other<br>
side of the wall, and if you make a mistake you are going to be breathing<br>
near-vacuum. At least at first, anything that jeopardizes life support<br>
integrity is going to be, er, discouraged to say the least.<br>
<p>
As for room to test dangerous new stuff, it's worth noting that if you go<br>
to the Moon, you don't need reactor containment vessels for your dirty<br>
fission reactors; if they melt down, well, you just stick up a wire<br>
fence saying NO ENTRY FOR 50,000 YEARS and walk away. With no atmosphere<br>
and no water around, there's no easy way for the dirty nucleides to <br>
spread and no way for them to get into your biosphere. On Mars, on the<br>
other hand, people are presumably thinking about terraforming within<br>
the next thousand years or so, and there's atmosphere ...<br>
<p>
The best place for dirty experimentation is in orbit out of the plane<br>
of the ecliptic, where if anything goes wrong it will _never_ come back<br>
to haunt us (where _never_ is a large but finite number evaluated in <br>
terms of geological time, not human lifespans).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [Oops, I'm rambling again...pardon the high SF-factor, but after all this</i><br>
<i>&gt; *is* a list where even crazier topics (like putting your mind into a machine,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and robots the size of a virus -- yeah right ;-) are discussed, so some</i><br>
<i>&gt; space travel will hardly make it weirder...]</i><br>
<p>
Hell, if you can stick your mind in a machine then the whole space<br>
colonization thing gets a lot easier. Human beings are soft, wet,<br>
messy machines that are inefficient and require lots of support<br>
facilities. <br>
<p>
My personal bet is that humans like us never get beyond Mars orbit in<br>
person -- but our minds will be exploring the nearer stars before the<br>
21st century is out.<br>
