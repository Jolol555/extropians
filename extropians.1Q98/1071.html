To riff on for a moment:<br>
<p>
The whole issue of personal self-determination is a strange field (or, in<br>
Hofstadter's term, a strange loop).<br>
<p>
A big part of that strange loop, for someone who comes to appreciate the<br>
N.A.P. (whether you capitalize Nonaggression Principle or not) is to<br>
apprehend for oneself, at a deep level, that coercion is, given your<br>
setting and goals, suboptimal *and* that better, effective alternatives<br>
exist. <br>
<p>
Examine each phrase there carefully. There are traps. The above is<br>
necessary, but not sufficient--as a big ferinstance, if the alternatives<br>
don't actually exist, you're lying to yourself/being lied to, which is<br>
functionally crazy. And of course _coercing people to believe in<br>
noncoercion_ is bogus, and also directly leads to functional crazy.<br>
<p>
Now, it may be "impossible" for some people to apprehend that coercion is<br>
suboptimal given their settings and goals. <br>
And it may be verging on impossible for disparate cultures to agree on what<br>
constitutes coercion. <br>
Those are toughies. <br>
<p>
Further, I keep harping on the not-very-subtext of Axelrod's _Evolution of<br>
Cooperation_, too, the biggest parts of which are rough parity among<br>
participants, punishment/negative consequences that *matter*, and no<br>
certainty that this will be your only/last interaction. None of these go<br>
without saying, and yet a lot of Axelrod-fanciers seem to put them aside.<br>
In my view, they have to be placed squarely on the table.<br>
<p>
IMHO, a lot of the "for your own good" people really haven't examined their<br>
own lives properly. Some did it once and never checked up and wandered off<br>
into the cornfields trailing paying customers. I do not name Ron or Werner<br>
here. :)<br>
<p>
I think these last three paras of mine relate to:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Typically the people who think that psychotherapy is good (for everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;else), or that things should be such and so a way (for your own good), are</i><br>
<i>&gt;usually motivated out of the best of intentions, and feel that they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;somehow annointed to do so, no matter how conservative or liberal those</i><br>
<i>&gt;people are, for the same reasona Columbus felt annointed to exterminate the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Native Americans, for the same reason the Kennedy's are always in politics,</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the same reason Lenin and Stalin did their deeds, and for the same reason</i><br>
<i>&gt;religious nuts bomb abortion clinics, and Hillary tries to push health care</i><br>
<i>&gt;'reform' on us.</i><br>
<p>
My favorite reframing of much of this is "You can't trust<br>
&lt;people/yourself&gt;, but you can trust MEEEeeeeee."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Any ideas how to practically do this?  Self help books? (_Controlling</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Coercion_: How Coercive Behavior is Self-Defeating)?  Lots of Internet</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; sites on the subject, with lots of information on how to eliminate</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; coercive behavior in oneself?  TV documentaries?  Popularizing discussion</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of coercion?</i><br>
<p>
Fostering "the lights going on" is a toughie. Cults get started that way.<br>
:) :)<br>
<p>
Given what I said above, it's what is technically termed a "wicked"<br>
problem. It's crying out for solution, but it's a minefield of local<br>
maxima--what I call "payoff traps"--plus history, hormones and strange<br>
attractors.<br>
<p>
I try to talk it and walk it, and am refining my ability to tell when the<br>
lights are on in other people. <br>
<p>
I try to maximize the payoff for others I know for whom the lights are on. <br>
<p>
Is this an ivory tower, ghettoization, or freedom of association? :)<br>
