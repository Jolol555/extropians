***  Firm's President Fails To Clarify Key Issues:<br>
By Craig D. Rose <br>
SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER <br>
January 16, 1998 <br>
<p>
Wayne Dunlap of Del Mar wants to talk with you about a great opportunity in <br>
the soon-to-be-deregulated $20 billion California electricity market.<br>
<p>
The Del Mar resident and thousands of others across the state are touting <br>
Boston-Finney, a company that is aggressively recruiting distributors and <br>
electricity customers. They promise discounts of 20 percent on electricity bills.<br>
<p>
The Harrisburg, Pa., company says it has enlisted 8,000 distributors like Dunlap <br>
and 30,000 customers in California, who expect to receive electricity from <br>
Boston-Finney when deregulation begins at the end of March.<br>
<p>
There's a problem: Boston-Finney doesn't have the authority to provide <br>
electricity to anyone in California.<br>
<p>
State regulators also are investigating the company's multilevel marketing practices,<br>
which were also questioned by the Public Utilities Commission late last year.<br>
<p>
What's more, one of the country's biggest energy providers said a key claim made<br>
 by Boston-Finney's representatives -- that the company can deliver discounts of <br>
20 percent -- would require selling electricity below cost.<br>
<p>
If deregulation of California's electricity market was crafted to cut power costs as <br>
well as avoid the massive scams of telephone deregulation, it may need some <br>
tinkering. The hundreds of new companies that have registered to provide electric <br>
service run the gamut from reputable to questionable, experts said.<br>
<p>
Consumer advocates urge ratepayers to exercise caution before switching to <br>
suppliers, examine terms in writing -- and ask lots of question.<br>
<p>
That isn't easy with Boston-Finney.<br>
<p>
The company's president declined to provide specifics about key operations in<br>
an interview yesterday. Christopher Mee, president of Boston-Finney, said the<br>
company's rapid growth had caused conflicting and confusing materials to be <br>
distributed by the company's account executives. He promised all representatives <br>
would soon be mailed uniform sales materials.<br>
<p>
But Mee refused to clarify many issues and declined to answer many questions <br>
about his company.<br>
<p>
Mee was unable, for example, to disclose where Boston-Finney would purchase <br>
electricity, and he declined to offer a single business reference, despite claims that <br>
Boston-Finney is aligned with "many of the largest commercial and industrial <br>
companies in the nation."<br>
<p>
Mee said his company has entered into service contracts with the state's major <br>
utilities. These agreements are essential if Boston-Finney is to assume <br>
responsibility for providing electricity to those customers. In fact, a spokesman <br>
for SDG&amp;E emphasized that the local utility will not accept a request to shift a <br>
customer unless the new provider has a service contract.<br>
<p>
But the SDG&amp;E spokesman as well as representatives for the other two major <br>
California utilities contradicted Mee's claim that Boston-Finney has service <br>
contracts with their companies. All said Boston-Finney didn't have an agreement <br>
with them, although dozens of others do. Mee also declined to confirm or deny <br>
newspaper reports in Pennsylvania indicating that he is 19 years old and has <br>
limited experience. He refused to discuss any aspect of his educational or <br>
professional background.<br>
<p>
State regulators say many customers are raising questions about aggressive <br>
marketers.<br>
<p>
"We have gotten lots of calls from people who are concerned, so naturally that<br>
 makes us concerned," said Wilson Lewis, supervisor of PUC's enforcement unit, <br>
which is a law enforcement agency. "We are looking into those allegations."<br>
<p>
$295 fee<br>
<p>
Some in the county already have seen enough.<br>
<p>
One Carlsbad resident said he pulled back from involvement with Boston-Finney, <br>
soon after writing a $295 check to cover the fee for becoming an account executive.<br>
<p>
"From what they presented it sounded good and fine," said Gordon Boslaviski of <br>
Carlsbad. "They say account executives receive corporate brochures, marketing <br>
material and letters of agency."<br>
<p>
Boslaviski said he got little but offers to buy these materials and nothing he <br>
considered substantial enough to offer prospective customers.<br>
<p>
"I couldn't sell people because I couldn't tell them this is what you're getting," <br>
said Boslaviski.<br>
<p>
Dunlap, on the other hand, accepts the company's explanation that materials had <br>
to be reprinted because of last-minute changes in its service offerings and <br>
compensation plans. He says he is buying materials from other account executives <br>
because that's cheaper than buying them from Boston-Finney itself. He has seen <br>
one small, glossy brochure from the company.<br>
<p>
"The quality of their brochures has little to do with with quality of the company,"<br>
 said Dunlap.  'Not comforting'<br>
<p>
Boston-Finney is set to purchase electricity cheaply as part of large national <br>
buying cooperative, allowing it to sell power cheaply in California and cut monthly<br>
electric bills by 20 percent, said Dunlap. But he confessed ignorance regarding <br>
details of the co-op and said his inability to get past voice mail and reach a human<br>
 being at Boston-Finney corporate headquarters -- a problem noted by others --<br>
 was "not comforting." <br>
<p>
One of the largest new electric providers in the state said promises of 20 percent <br>
savings on electricity would be difficult to fulfill.<br>
<p>
Stuart Rexrode, director of consumer services of Enron Energy Services, which <br>
yesterday announced an agreement valued at $280 million over four years to <br>
provide power to Pacific Telesis, noted that all companies selling electricity in <br>
California incur much the same overhead costs, which are imposed by the state to <br>
pay off unprofitable assets of the major utilities. <br>
<p>
Noting that Enron is the largest electricity wholesaler in the country, Rexrode <br>
added: "So companies that make claims of 20 percent are pricing their product at <br>
about 10 percent below what their cost structure would be."<br>
