Anyone interested in the "evolution" of the<br>
notion of "I" may find Julian Jaynes's 'The<br>
Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of<br>
the Bicameral Mind' of interest.<br>
<p>
My understanding is that all epiphenomena are<br>
real.<br>
<p>
The phenomenon of hypostatization -- the notion<br>
that because we use a certain word, there must<br>
be a corresponding existing entity -- may be<br>
relevant here.<br>

<i>&gt;Christopher Fedeli wrote 3/7/98: &lt;I've noticed a strong tendency for all</i><br>
<i>&gt;memetically minded thinkers to keep clinging to some notion of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;metaphysical "I".  How can one accept that all of our traits came to be the</i><br>
<i>&gt;way that they are by the evolution of genes and memes, and yet still think</i><br>
<i>&gt;that somewhere 'in there' is a "me" who is capable of exercising some</i><br>
<i>&gt;control over the process?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To take a famous example, Richard Dawkins argues that humans can "rebel </i><br>
<i>&gt;against the tyranny of the selfish replicators."  He gives the example that</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;every time we use contraception, we are rebelling against the tyranny of</i><br>
<i>&gt;genes who want us to procreate.  But who is really rebelling in this</i><br>
<i>&gt;example?  To me, this seems like an case of the meme for contraception</i><br>
<i>&gt;winning a big victory in the battle for survival against certain genes. </i><br>
<i>&gt;But to hypothesize a magical "self" that lurks around in our brains,</i><br>
<i>&gt;deciding which memes and which genes will exercise influence over our</i><br>
<i>&gt;behaviors at which time is a joke that no reflective thinker could suffer. </i><br>
<i>&gt;        </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Will anyone argue differently?&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And Frederick Mann replied 3/7/98: &lt;I agree that there is no magical "self"</i><br>
<i>&gt;or "I" in reality.  However, in the same way that I can load a program</i><br>
<i>&gt;called</i><br>
<i>&gt;"I" into a computer, some complex brain circuitry could evolve and call</i><br>
<i>&gt;itself "I."  And at some point this circuitry could achieve sufficient</i><br>
<i>&gt;complexity to spontaneously produce the epiphenomenon of free will</i><br>
<i>&gt;or volition.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I know this seems to be difficult for many individuals to grasp, but there</i><br>
<i>&gt;really is a subjective "I".  Subjectivity is an unpleasant fact of nature</i><br>
<i>&gt;for scientists because there is no way to study it, measure it, experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt;on it, or theorize about it.  So all too many of them take the</i><br>
<i>&gt;intellectually lazy or dippy way out of their conundrum by pretending it</i><br>
<i>&gt;away.  It never works, of course.  Subjectivity is just one of those things</i><br>
<i>&gt;in reality that is a given, there is an "I" that is just as real as</i><br>
<i>&gt;external objects that we can measure.  Free will or volition is not an</i><br>
<i>&gt;epiphenomenon, it is real.  The brain does not work the same way a computer</i><br>
<i>&gt;does in at least one very important respect.  Information does not exist in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the absence of an "I", a knower who is distinct from the known.  "I" can</i><br>
<i>&gt;exchange information with "my" environment, with external objects, with</i><br>
<i>&gt;other subjective selves, even with "my" own body, in that it is an external</i><br>
<i>&gt;object to "me."  However, "I" cannot exchange information with myself, with</i><br>
<i>&gt;"I".  "I" cannot be both subject and object, both knower and known.  When</i><br>
<i>&gt;Socrates said "know thyself," he could only be talking about knowing your</i><br>
<i>&gt;body as it is an object to you and about your relations with other selves</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the external environment.  He could not be talking about knowing your</i><br>
<i>&gt;own self, your "I".  You don't know yourself, you don't exchange</i><br>
<i>&gt;information with yourself, you simply decide.  Decisions are the atmosphere</i><br>
<i>&gt;of subjectivity.  The protection of volitional freedom is of primary</i><br>
<i>&gt;importance because of this.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps a consideration that "selfish genes" and "memes" are a load of</i><br>
<i>&gt;hooey is in order if you are forced to pretend that subjectivity isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;real, or that there is no real "I".  Perhaps some deeper reflection is in</i><br>
<i>&gt;order.</i><br>
