Most great ancient philosophers were pedophiles,<br>
slave owners, and wholeheartedly approved various<br>
"interesting activities", from sex with animals<br>
(should there be freedom for it?) to ritual human<br>
sacrifices.  Somehow nobody feels disturbed about it.<br>
<p>
Also, is the concept of *any* relations between<br>
adults and children "inherently and fatally flawed",<br>
because the adults are authoritarian? Or many of<br>
these relations are productive exactly because of<br>
the authority - like teaching?  What if there is<br>
a relationship between a tough 15-yo slut and a<br>
timid 25yo virgin?  What about an authoritarian<br>
relationship or difference in social status or<br>
intelligence, or in sexual experience between<br>
adults?  Who should be considered a child, and<br>
who should measure authority?<br>
<p>
I think if somebody wants to claim that something<br>
is wrong, he should provide good rational arguments<br>
why each of those parameters (age, authority, type<br>
of relationship, etc.) is chosen, and why authority<br>
and experience are so bad in one case while they are<br>
so good in another.  Otherwise, such arguments will<br>
never lead anywhere.<br>
<p>
Maybe we should declare war to the perverted people<br>
of India and Middle East where a marriage of a young<br>
girl to a mature man of authority is considered a<br>
natural social norm (as well as in lots of other<br>
cultures throughout human history). What's wrong with<br>
all those people?  Is it women's liberation that made<br>
us rethink our principles, or higher educational<br>
requirements? (why don't we prohibit fools to breed then?)<br>
