<p>
As stated below, today's economy is not the same as the economy of 1980. That the 20%<br>
cut in income taxes led to the largest spurt of growth in the postwar era is not<br>
debatable. That we needed deficit speding to soak up the dollar supply overseas that<br>
had been accumulating during the postwar gold standard era in order to kill<br>
inflationary trends that began after Nixon let the nation loose from the GOld<br>
Standard is also widely accepted. That the huge defense buildup of the early 80's<br>
financed the computer industry to a viable status, to which we now owe our present<br>
incredible gains in productivity (which is what is paying all of those increased tax<br>
revinues) is also not debatable... A very good case can be made that we owe our<br>
present economic vitality in large part to the economic policies of the Reagan era. I<br>
notice that countries (and liberal controlled states here in the US) that laughed at<br>
Reagans economics are now still rather behind the average US economic performance.<br>
<p>
Also note that Reagan's policies of deregulation, which he was not very successfull<br>
at due to a democrat controlled congress, have gone very far to help the economy as<br>
well, now that a Democrat president has jumped on the deregulation bandwagon....<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; "trickle down" resulted in real dollar decreases in the incomes of the lowest</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 60% of American society.  During the 1960s when the tax system was decidely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; progressive (with the highest marginal tax rate exceeding 70%) all portions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; American society experiencd real wage growth.  And what about countries such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't know if I can buy this.  There are some differences in the world</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy between the 60's and the 80's.</i><br>
<p>
Its false. It is based on government inflation statistics which even Greenspan has<br>
acknowledged were hopelessly wrong. If inflation is reported to be higher than it<br>
really is, then, by the reported statistics, wage growth that keeps pace with real<br>
inflation is seen to be declining wages. The stats in the 80s also completely ignored<br>
the increase in the average standard of living on a systemic basis due to advances in<br>
technology in the home....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unreasonable that the ones who reap the most from the American system pay a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; higher portion (though still retaining ample amounts unto themselves) in return</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My problem is that the biggest expenses are welfare for old folks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Defense, welfare for poor people, and other things, don't add up to that</i><br>
<i>&gt; much; it's SS and Medicare which dominate.</i><br>
<p>
Its been estimated that entitlement liabilities the government owes to retirees will<br>
exceed the entire federal budget sometime around 2015-2020. No money for pork,<br>
defense, education, children, foreign aid, research, etc. The US government will be<br>
owned lock stock and barrel by the AARP, and we'll all be wage slaves to the<br>
oldsters. I'll be turning 50 in 2018, so maybe its not such a bad thing for me, or<br>
anyone else over 30 right now, as we'll be in the ruling party.<br>
<p>
When this happens, kids won't just be killing other kids, they'll be taking out<br>
retirees, while the AARP will be having lynchings of teenage punks.<br>
