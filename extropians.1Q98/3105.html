I think you underestimate the power a prosecutor wields in bringing<br>
accusations.  Placing the burden of proof on the state (or whatever person or<br>
agency brings what amounts to criminal accusation) has proven to be one fairly<br>
effective curb on that power.  Consider that literally every single expert<br>
observer of legal processes who is guided by fundamental values of liberty has<br>
come to the conclusion that placing the burden of proof on the accuser is the<br>
best starting point for any system of justice.  Then read one of the classics<br>
of legal writing, Kafka's "The Trial".  Then, guilty or innocent, be accused<br>
of a crime.  Then come back and tell me that you want the accused to have to<br>
bear the burden of proof.<br>
<p>
If prosecutors were morally perfect people, the burden of proof wouldn't<br>
matter.  But they aren't, and it does.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  AI has nothing to do with it, these justice computers could be just a</i><br>
couple<br>
<i>&gt;  of simple PCS. </i><br>
<p>
Any proposition of fact that could be judged by a "simple PC" would be so<br>
laden with judgment already that the PC would be little more than the word<br>
processor on which the result is written.  I wish we were at a stage where a<br>
PC could really "add up facts"; in fact, today's PCs still do very little more<br>
than perform arithmetical calculations on simple strings of symbols.  (I know<br>
-- that's all a Turing machine ever does . . .)  Most of the intelligence<br>
still lies in the user's interpretation of the output of those calculations.<br>
<p>
I don't doubt that we will have synthetic, non-human entities that will be<br>
both the subject and object of a justice system, but when we do, we'll just<br>
have invited such entities to share in the age-old conundrums of justice.<br>
They might well do better than natural, unaltered humans for being able to<br>
think more quickly and clearly, but they will still have to weigh facts and<br>
conflicting evidence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Justice *should* be a matter of "adding up the facts", not</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "the whim of the day" of some judge. In a fair justice system one can</i><br>
<i>&gt;  count on an equal treatment of all cases. The best way to do this is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  minimize the power of the human judges so that they truly speak on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  behalf of the _law_, and not themselves. </i><br>
<p>
I wonder whether some of your ideas may grow out of familiarity only with what<br>
we in the Anglo-American word call "the Continental system" or "Code system"<br>
of justice, in which judges take a much more active role in the juridical<br>
process than in the common law system.  The Anglo-American system (no offense<br>
to the Australians and New Zealanders -- I'm sure they call it the Anglo-<br>
Australian system, etc.) has been characterized by a steady process of<br>
curtailing the role of judges.  In this system, on a case-by-case basis, rules<br>
develop to systematize the legal matrix that is laid over the factual material<br>
brought forward by advocates for the parties to particular cases.  In cases<br>
dealing with familiar questions (murder who-dunnits, for instance), the<br>
discretion of the judge is highly constrained on a fine-grained issue-by-issue<br>
basis.  For example, each specific piece of evidence offered is considered<br>
within a specific set of rules for admissibility and weight crafted through<br>
the precedential system to fit the peculiar problems presented by evidence of<br>
that KIND.<br>
<p>
In a case presenting no truly novel issues, the rules developed by the common<br>
law system isolate final fact questions quite well so that, at the end of a<br>
trial very little is left to discretion.  What IS left to discretion is almost<br>
always just the sort of judgment call that can't be reduced to mechanical<br>
rules.<br>
<p>
In this regard, the common law system of case precedent can be seen as a very<br>
slow AI system itself.  Whether any particular line of trial and appellate<br>
judges actually does follow the law developed by this system is another<br>
question -- a political one.  It seems though that any "artificial" system<br>
able to fully comprehend and apply the entire corpus of such laws would be at<br>
least as complex as a human judge or lawyer.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  The lie detector would only be used as a tool to add some pressure to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  questioning, and could only serve as supporting evidence, not primary </i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that can lead to a conviction. It works because only the guilty know the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  details of the crime in question (it is not allowed to give details to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; media),</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and only a guilty person would be nervous if the police brought him in for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  questioning (because, believe it or not, this would be a pretty fair </i><br>
<i>&gt; judicial</i><br>
<i>&gt;  system, with *very* little chance of false convictions due to the many</i><br>
<i>&gt;  safeties (monitoring of all legal personel and facilities - tough </i><br>
<i>&gt; punishments for </i><br>
<i>&gt;  "bad cops" etc.) and hard evidence-based convictions (when in doubt - don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;  convict). If you can beat the lie detector that doesn't mean you can go</i><br>
home,<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  although it can be used as minor supporting evidence to your innocence.</i><br>
<p>
The age-old question: Who watches the watchers?  It seems that you have a<br>
human in the loop; in a sense, the old "homunculus" of epistemology.  As Nick<br>
Szabo has written, many legal processes can be automated.  I agree with him,<br>
within the regimes he proposes (contracts that have quantifiable subjects).<br>
But as I have had the pleasure of seeing, Nick has come to the independent<br>
conclusion that the long process of case-by-case rule development of the<br>
common law can't really be improved upon.  I commend the material you'll find<br>
at his web site<br>

<p>
 as an example of someone not infected by the legal-education system, who has<br>
brought both some fresh insight to the subject AND has independently verified<br>
the validity of many of the systemic values of the common law.<br>
