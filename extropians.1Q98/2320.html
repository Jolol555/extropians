I have been reading some of the discussion on motivations.  I find it <br>
interesting that no one has mentioned the best answer to the "why" <br>
question that we have--natural selection.<br>
<p>
Natural selection is the most compelling explanation of where <br>
motivations originally came from.  Why do we enjoy sex?  Why do we <br>
enjoy fast food?  Why do we like sweets?  Why do we see beauty in <br>
savanna-like landscapes?  Each of these questions requires a <br>
non-circular response.  The best one I've seen is that natural <br>
selection has carefully crafted these preferences in our species.  <br>
Such preferences promoted survival and reproduction.  Why would a <br>
further answer than this be necessary?  I suggest people read Stephen <br>
Pinker's "The Way the Mind Works" for an excellent discussion of <br>
these issues in evolutionary psychology.<br>
<p>
In the end, there is no meaning.  Meaning is in the journey.  Don't <br>
expect a completed life project.  Probably no one has ever died <br>
satisfied.<br>
