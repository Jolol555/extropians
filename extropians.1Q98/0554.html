In this case, the atheists -- as distinct from the agnostics -- are <br>
at least as unjustified as the theists.<br>
<p>
(A theist might -- as I have -- experience an extremely real but <br>
entirely personal manifestation of a deity which would make <br>
non-belief irrational for THAT PERSON, without providing any <br>
externally verifiable evidence they could reasonably expect anyone <br>
else to accept.   I cannot imagine a similarly compelling personal <br>
manifestation of the non-existence of any deity.  Thus, some specific <br>
theists might be more justified than any atheist.  However, I also am <br>
reasonably sure that the large majority of theists have had no such <br>
personal experience.)<br>
