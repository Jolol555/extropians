<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; Why are Bill and/or Hillary obligated to tell us the truth </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; about their private sexual lives? </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; IAN: I agree that they are not so obliged. It seems </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to me that lies about private and consensual sexual </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; activity do not fall into the category of unethical, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; since private means "off limits" by definition, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; therefore this whole affair should be off limits to </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; both the press and Starr. People going into public </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; life have to sacrifice many areas of their private </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; lives, but their sexual activity, so long as it is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; consensual, is and should not be one of those areas. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is the question of whether all the sexual activity is </i><br>
<i>&gt;consensual, or whether some of it constitutes abuse of authority -- </i><br>
<i>&gt;with the proviso that if one of these ladies *wanted* to have sex </i><br>
<i>&gt;with the President, that wasn't Clinton's fault; what I am concerned </i><br>
<i>&gt;about is the potential for suggestions (ranging from extremely vague </i><br>
<i>&gt;hints to blatant declarations), coming directly or indirectly from </i><br>
<i>&gt;Clinton, that sex would be rewarded or refusal punished.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: That's a valid argument. Also, as I understand,<br>
  military code states that adultery is grounds for <br>
  dishonorable discharge. That would mean that such<br>
  activity is by law a proper area of concern for <br>
  military personnel -- wether it should or should<br>
  not be. Since Clinton is the Commander in Chief, <br>
  the supreme leader of the military....<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I would point out that exactly the same concerns arise in regard to </i><br>
<i>&gt;lying about sex, though. And it is moderately well established that </i><br>
<i>&gt;Clinton himself *did* instruct, in an employer-to-subordinate mode, </i><br>
<i>&gt;one of his staffers to lie about certain meetings with one of his </i><br>
<i>&gt;alleged mistresses. That is enough in my mind to establish abuse of </i><br>
<i>&gt;authority.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Right, but it's a complex extension of what<br>
  might not properly be proper grounds of inquiry.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;And for that matter, "None of your business" would have won Clinton</i><br>
<i>&gt;a *lot* of sympathy *without* being a lie. Clinton chose an </i><br>
<i>&gt;unconvincing lie over a convincing truth. On his head be the </i><br>
<i>&gt;consequences.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unfortunately, in spite of all that, I find myself compelled to </i><br>
<i>&gt;support him and hope he survives the scandal -- for as long as Gore </i><br>
<i>&gt;is next in line.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Of course being the conspiracy type, I think<br>
  this is all a calculated diversion from the real<br>
  issues, being the real crimes of the Clinton <br>
  administration, such as mass murder in Waco, as<br>
  evidenced/proven by FLIR video, links to the OKC <br>
  bombing, to the TWA 800 coverup, and to the deaths<br>
  of many people. The theory would have it that the<br>
  "real planners" are getting Clinton out before <br>
  other far more devastating news comes to light. <br>
<p>
  But of course the Establishment (GovtMedia) has<br>
  done a pretty good job of preventing justice so<br>
  far, I also can't see why they cannot continue <br>
  to do so. So the current affair is strange. But <br>
  suffice it to say there is far more serious mis-<br>
  conduct connected to Clinton than telling a staff<br>
  intern to deny that she sucked on his penis. Ulti-<br>
  mately everyone knows everyone else does something <br>
  sexual, but to know that leaders willfully engage<br>
  is murder and mayhem is detrimental to the con-<br>
  tinuation of the current state of leadership.<br>
  So he get's nailed for the "acceptable."<br>
