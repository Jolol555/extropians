If so-called "rational" extropians cannot discuss the definition of human<br>
without resorting to vitriol, irrational ethical emotivism and kneejerk<br>
bigotry, what can we expect from the "irrational" general public after<br>
human speciation occurs, after we've created super posthuman master races -<br>
of whatever form?<br>
<p>
Why should the public listen to individuals who represent themselves as<br>
extropians, supposedly holding to principles of protecting and enhancing<br>
intelligent life, when they condone cannibalism, when they condone the<br>
murder and arbitrary use of developing selves until those selves are<br>
capable of standing up and shouting "I claim rights for myself"?  If<br>
children, born or unborn, have no rights until they can claim them, adults<br>
can use them as resources for *anything* a twisted mind can conceive.  The<br>
general public is not brain dead yet, extropian credibility just took a<br>
turn for the worse.<br>
<p>
I read recently where China has 53 million missing females, they are<br>
statistically expected from normal demographic trends but simply not there.<br>
 Guess why they're not there.  They were not referred to as missing "fetal<br>
tissue" or missing "viable tissue mass" or missing "clumps of tissue" or<br>
missing "small lumps of biological matter."  They are missing women.  I<br>
can't think of anything being more "anti-woman" than this capital fact.<br>
<p>
This is the result of the vision of world unity that the self-anointed<br>
world demographic managers hold - the High Priests and Priestesses of the<br>
Cult of Unfertility - and I can't believe that self-proclaimed extropians<br>
are in league with them, passively by sharing their definition of human, or<br>
actively.  Real extropians view developing selves as more gray cells.  The<br>
self-anointed depopulation experts view them as more alimentary canals. <br>
The difference is stark and uncompromising.  Think of what 53 million<br>
Chinese women might have thought of to improve and enhance life; the<br>
abortion fanatics just think of 53 million stomachs to fill and 53 million<br>
bowels to empty.  Call me a hopeless optimist, but I am with the late<br>
Julian Simon in believing that intelligence trumps resource limitations,<br>
and the more gray cells the better.  The Malthusian vision is false, the<br>
race between humans and resources is not a fair race because resources are<br>
stupid and individuals are not.<br>
<p>
As to what Roe v. Wade legalized, I'll stand by my original post, this is<br>
the law of the land.  "In America, abortion is legal on demand right<br>
through nine months, in fact, right up to having the baby 2/3 out of the<br>
birth canal on its due date."  A Gallop poll conducted in the spring of<br>
1990 found that 80 percent of Americans disagreed that abortion was legal<br>
on demand through nine months and 65 percent disagreed strongly.  It is a<br>
common case of legal illiteracy.  A majority of five justices is all it<br>
takes to continue the holocaust.  The Webster and Casey cases did allow<br>
some states to place some conditions on abortion, but the fact remains that<br>
if you live in America, you can legally find a place that will abort your<br>
child on its due date with the child 2/3 out of the birth canal for *any<br>
reason whatsoever*.  Even the doctor who recently testified before Congress<br>
that partial birth abortions were rare and primarily done to protect the<br>
life of the mother, later recanted his testimony out of shame, and admitted<br>
that they were far more prevalent than the orthodox press dared report and<br>
that 90% were elective, i.e., on demand.<br>
<p>
Outright infanticide, as some so-called extropians have inferred should be<br>
allowed, will have to wait a bit for the Supreme Court to follow its own<br>
logic out to its deathly end.  If all lines drawn as to when a developing<br>
self is entitled to rights are arbitrary - that is, all lines drawn after<br>
conception - then the line can be moved anywhere at all on an emotional<br>
whim, from 2 weeks to 40 years.  There is *no* rationality involved in<br>
arbitrarily picking a line, only different levels of emotional<br>
squeamishness.  If we desensitize our population through education and<br>
popular culture, we can do anything we want.  If we can eliminate enough<br>
squeamishness, we can deal with the minority who remain squeamish.  For<br>
example, there'll be no more messy frog dissections in high school biology.<br>
 Rather, the dissections will be done on computer simulations of humans,<br>
encouraging the entropic view of them as "meat machines."  Our<br>
squeamishness is sanitized as our students are brutalized.  The technique<br>
worked well in the SS boot camps.<br>
<p>
The arguments for rape, incest, life-of-the-mother and fatal defects are<br>
rational, even if they prescribe tragic consequences.  These can be worked<br>
out, jurisdiction by jurisdiction.  But in America, they amount to roughly<br>
3% of all abortions.  It is not rational to open the sluiceway to the<br>
culture of death to deal with small numbers of exceptional cases.<br>

Arjen Kamphuis wrote 3/4/98: <br>
RJ: &lt;As we slip closer and closer to a world government of some sort or<br>
another, there will be no place on earth left to move to in order to escape<br>
the culture of death.&gt;<br>
<p>
AK: &lt;As I said before: You can always move to the Vatican&gt;<br>
<p>
As to moving to the Vatican, I don't think we can squeeze 5 billion people<br>
into a postage-stamp size country.  Will the world death-worshipping elites<br>
allow them any other jurisdiction "with liberty and justice for all"?  Your<br>
solution in mediaeval times was known as ghettoization.  I predict that<br>
those who oppose the oncoming world government's forcing abortion,<br>
euthanasia and assisted suicide "rights" on everyone, will in fact, be<br>
ghettoized, at least until the elites develop a final solution to them.  I<br>
see this tangibly, as if I were reading today's headlines.  The logic in<br>
entropic worldviews is inexorable.<br>
<p>
When I drive by the local abortion "clinic" every day, I am acutely aware<br>
that I am driving by a Nazi or Stalinist death camp.  There are death camps<br>
spread "liberally" throughout the world, in neighborhoods.  Those who would<br>
condemn the German or Russian citizen for living next to their death camps<br>
without speaking up or questioning have absolutely no grounds to do so<br>
unless they recognize the holocaust going on in their own backyard.  Every<br>
time some tinpot dictator, some politician or over-active bureaucrat<br>
proposes a new restrictive law or regulation "for the safety and sake of<br>
the children," I always substitute "for the survivors" in my head.  The<br>
moral logic of doing anything for children within the culture of death is<br>
twisted beyond recognition.<br>
<p>
Arjen Kamphuis wrote 3/4/98:<br>
AK: &lt;I don't claim to know what the definition of a human is but I'm pretty<br>
sure you and I are human.&gt;<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;I do know.&gt;<br>
<p>
AK: &lt;Then why haven't you won a couple of Nobel prizes or something?  Do<br>
you even grasp the enormous arrogance of those three words?&gt;<br>
<p>
Non sequitor.  What do the globally balanced, politically correct Nobel<br>
prizes have to do with the definition of human?  Is the ever-so politically<br>
circumspect Nobel prize committee who we go to in order to be granted<br>
rights?  Do you grasp that you and your fellow travelers are arrogantly<br>
forcing your definition on everyone else, with the exception of the one<br>
ghetto you'll allow us, the Vatican?<br>
<p>
Jay (Entropyfoe) wrote 3/4/98: &lt;If any religion can be said to be<br>
Extropian, Buddhism is the greatest in extent.&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't think I can answer this bit of nonsense better than Friedrich<br>
Nietzsche did in "Will to Power" so I will quote him:  "Every purely moral<br>
value system (that of Buddhism, for example) ends in nihilism:  this to be<br>
expected in Europe....  [T]he weary nihilism that no longer attacks; its<br>
most famous form, Buddhism; a passive nihilism, a sign of weakness. <br>
Nihilism does not only contemplate the 'in vain!' nor is it merely the<br>
belief that everything deserves to perish:  one helps to destroy.   This<br>
is, if you will, illogical; but the nihilist does not believe that one<br>
needs to be logical.  The reduction to nothing by judgment is seconded by<br>
the reduction to nothing by hand....  [T]he most extreme form of nihilism: <br>
the nothing (the 'meaningless'), eternally!  The European form of Buddhism:<br>
 the energy of knowledge and strength compels this belief.  It is the most<br>
*scientific* of all possible hypotheses.  We deny end goals:  if existence<br>
had one it would have to have been reached....  Nihilism as a symptom that<br>
the underprivileged have no comfort left; that they destroy in order to be<br>
destroyed....  [T]he overall aim is, in... Buddhist... terms:  'better<br>
*not* to be than to be.'  I see all philosophers, I see science kneeling<br>
before a reality that is the reverse of the struggle for existence as<br>
taught by Darwin's school - that is to say, I see on top and surviving<br>
everywhere those who compromise life and the value of life."  Tell it,<br>
preacher man!  Extropians, listen to the authority here.  "Those who<br>
compromise life and the value of life" are nihilists, not extropians.<br>
<p>
Michael Lorrey wrote 3/4/98: &lt;Outlawing abortion is just one more example<br>
of illegal extraterritorial exercise of power that we all should fight<br>
against.&gt;<br>
<p>
Welcome to the One World Government, the *only* avenue for enforcing<br>
abortion everywhere on earth.  And woe to those who oppose it; the iron<br>
logic of tyranny.<br>
<p>
It is very intersting to see which of my points and questions go<br>
unanswered.  The silence is deafening.  I don't count ethical emotivism as<br>
containing any answers, only personal expressions of feelings, and<br>
individuals who use feelings as a moral guide are little better than slaves<br>
responding to their masters' instruction of what *to* feel.<br>
<p>
This goes unanswered:<br>
RJ: &lt;Are you saying that the possession of intelligence is the source of<br>
rights?&gt;<br>
<p>
AK: &lt;The ability to have Intelligence &amp; consiousness.&gt;<br>
<p>
RJ:  &lt;And who determines whether ability is there or not, at what threshold<br>
of ability?  Which individuals grant us our rights?  Can I talk to them?&gt;<br>
<p>
This goes unanswered:<br>
AK: &lt;All consious beings should be treated with respect whether they are<br>
humans, dolphins or computers.&gt;<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;Why should I?  Who says so?&gt;<br>
<p>
This goes unanswered:<br>
RJ: &lt;The key is in the concept of development.  Development of the self,<br>
self-ownership, means others should stay hands off.  But development of<br>
other selves, that is, non-consensual development, is ownership of other<br>
selves.  Other selves have every right to question this activity and to<br>
bring the activity into the political sphere.  The concepts of guardianship<br>
and power of attorney evolved in society to champion the rights of<br>
developing selves that are incapable of acting as their own champions.... <br>
Developed is a static concept that I have never observed in living<br>
entities.  Life is always "developing," from conception to death.  Even<br>
with indefinite longevity, no one will ever be "developed," they will<br>
indefinitely be "developing."&gt;<br>
<p>
This goes unanswered:<br>
RJ: &lt;When you speak of the "source of the rule" all I see is the very<br>
oldest rule of all, "might makes right."  Nature is red in tooth and claw. <br>
If it is legitimate for the strong to prey upon the weak, sooner or later,<br>
we will end up, not as a society, but as isolated systems of perfected<br>
self-defense staring at each other across no-man's land.&gt;<br>
<p>
This goes unanswered:<br>
RJ: &lt;What's wrong with commercializing all life, at all stages of<br>
development, including humans, intelligent or otherwise, conscious or<br>
otherwise?  Just make all life into products in the marketplace, all custom<br>
designed for any use whatsoever?  "If destroying it is acceptable," why<br>
would any use not be, living or dead?&gt;<br>
<p>
P.S. Thanks to Gene Leitl for pointing out the obvious re: future master<br>
races giving short shrift to lowly humans.  I would add that we should<br>
expect them to be giving especially short shrift to humans who have<br>
exhibited a pronounced death fetish regarding the weak.  Not a good example<br>
to our masterful progeny who may very well view *us* as embryonic.<br>
<p>
Also, thanks to others for the private support.<br>
