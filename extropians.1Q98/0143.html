<i>&gt; I would like to see some sort of organism-wide testing device that could</i><br>

<i>&gt; are willing to share it.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds like a great idea. In the books on calory restriction there are<br>
some suggestions tests for biomarkers of aging, but a good testing<br>
device would likely need to both measure the chemical composition of<br>
the blood and macroscopic properties like lung capacity and overall<br>
stamina - it would quickly turn into a rather big and baroque device<br>
with lots of hoses, needles, scanners and levers :-)<br>
<p>
The dream would be something like a flatbed scanner which<br>
noninvasively scanned you and calculated all the necessary stuff from<br>
the data. Unfortunately that seems to be rather hard to do at present,<br>
even given the advances in NMR.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As a practical aside, which specific dimensions would be most useful to</i><br>
<i>&gt; measure?</i><br>
<p>
I think a blood-test device would be useful, if limited. Maybe also<br>
some kind of tissue-mechanics test (collagene flexibility, skin<br>
properties).<br>
<p>
My own interest is of course cognition. I have for a long time planned<br>
to write a cognitive test suite in java, so that one can objectively<br>
test one's progress, effects of lifestyle, age, nootropics etc without<br>
the hassle. Another fun idea I have been thinking of is some kind of<br>
reverse neuropsychology test: you undertake a detailled mental test,<br>
from which your neurotransmittor levels could be roughly estimated<br>
(useful to tune nootropics). But right now these are pipe dreams. <br>
