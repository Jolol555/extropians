Centralism, as I understand and use the term, means a regime where a<br>
single decision in the name of the group - whether made by decree or by<br>
universal vote - takes precedence over the decisions of individuals or<br>
smaller groups.<br>
<p>
Admittedly the term is not meaningful without a context, namely the<br>
scale in question.  All voluntary actions of my body-parts are<br>
controlled by a single entity, so I am "centralist" on a small scale<br>
(bigger than I'd prefer, sigh).  Similarly all the actions of the firm<br>
where I work (sixty-odd people) are coordinated by a few partners, so<br>
the firm as seen from inside is centralist.  But outside, both I and the<br>
firm interact with many others as peers; this web of activity has no<br>
center.<br>
