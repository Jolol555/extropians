----------<br>
<i>&gt; From: Mark Miloscia &lt;miloscia@sprintmail.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Morality and Values!  I love this discussion.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, so do I. The irrationality of some people never ceases to amaze me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Authoritarian regimes are directly at fault for allowing their people to die</i><br>
in a<br>
<i>&gt; horrible manner.  The developed world (including all of us) is also at fault for</i><br>
<i>&gt; allowing starvation and death to occur when they have the power (either</i><br>
individually or<br>
<i>&gt; through their government) to stop or mitigate it.</i><br>
<p>
And why would the developed world be responsible for other regions' stupidity?<br>
They were already a mess when the big bad white man came, you know. It's<br>
not like some highly advanced culture got nipped in the bud, certainly not in<br>
Africa. They live like we lived once. We moved on, they didn't. Who's fault is<br>
that? OURS?  Why doesn't the principle of personal responsibility for one's<br>
actions apply to developing regions then?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Two key questions. Should we individually or collectively value all human</i><br>
life?  <br>
<p>
No. Some lives (people) are obviously worth more than others (in the _real world_,<br>
not Happyland or something).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do we have a (moral) responsiblity, individually or collectively, to prevent or</i><br>
reduce<br>
<i>&gt; human suffering and death?  </i><br>
<p>
No. Responsibility for your own actions will suffice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     There is no doubt in my mind that most people would drop whatever they are</i><br>
doing<br>
<i>&gt; and fly to Ethiopia or picket the US Capitol, do what ever it takes, and try to</i><br>
rescue<br>
<i>&gt; their spouse or sibling or parent or offspring if they were one of those starving</i><br>
<i>&gt; statistics.  Most people would think it strange (irresponsible even) if I</i><br>
mentioned<br>
<i>&gt; that my wife was "...dying in some Ethopian hell-hole. Darn those Warlords, it's</i><br>
their<br>
<i>&gt; fault.  Oh, by the way, did you see those Knicks last night, blew another game..."</i><br>
 I<br>
<i>&gt; bet Ethiopia would be hip-deep in Marines if Hillary C. was lost somewhere</i><br>
in-country.<br>
<p>
Of course you'd go trough more for someone you actually know and care about<br>
than for some anonymous masses of an alien culture. That's rational. When<br>
your resources are limited, you must by definition set priorities, and obviously<br>
your friends and family rank a lot higher than some unknown person on the<br>
other side of the globe who has almost nothing in common with you. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; However, my mom always taught me that "the good guys always win in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the end" and my Christian faith also teaches me the same.  </i><br>
<p>
Wow! How do you manage to combine religious belief with transhumanism?<br>
<p>
For the record, here's part of my ideology:<br>
<p>
Pro:<br>
<p>
Abortion (pro choice, not squeamish about number of months of pregnancy).<br>
Capital punishment (and "eye for an eye" in general). <br>
Right to have duels.<br>
Freedom of speech (not including slander).<br>
Right to die (euthanasia).<br>
Right to (cryo)preserve deceased people without their consent. They don't <br>
know so they can't suffer. Decisions about revival can be made later, when<br>
we have more knowledge about mental illness etc.<br>
Right to keep and bear arms, and to use them in self-defense (with lethal<br>
force, if necessary). <br>
Right to enhance yourself physically and mentally (right to auto-evolve).<br>
Right to use any kind of medical or recreational drug.<br>
Right to do anything else you want as long as you don't harm any <br>
members of your contract group (this is a group of people<br>
who have chosen to co-operate for mutual benefit and have agreed<br>
on certain rules to minimize problems -- the way a society should<br>
be) against their will.<br>
<p>
Con:<br>
<p>
Murder, rape, theft, stalking, damage to property and other obviously harmful <br>
acts commited against members of the contract group.<br>
<p>
Non-judicial:<br>
Taboos (things that cannot be discussed in a normal fashion) of any kind.<br>
Sanctimoniousness (a hugely damaging force in society).<br>
