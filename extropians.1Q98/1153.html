Excerpts from the journal of David Jensen, an early mind transfer patient.<br>
<p>
&lt;&gt; 2031 March 12th, Wednesday, 2:02 PM<br>
<p>
Riding to my third and final briefing session with the brain surgeons. I<br>
review my notes from the last two sessions. At the first session they<br>
talked about early discoveries with the corpus callosum, (big nerve<br>
bundle linking the left brain with the right brain) and the experiences<br>
of patients in the 1900's who had one side of their brain removed, and<br>
other patients who had to have various pieces taken out. It was kind of<br>
creepy but I think they were getting me used to the fact that some<br>
pretty serious things were going to happen to me if I gave the go-ahead.<br>
I'm still a little queasy about having them cut into me. Anyway, at the<br>
end of the session they asked the $100,000 question: Now that you've<br>
heard what it's like to have half your brain disconnected and removed,<br>
imagine the reverse -- having a new brain *added* and *attached*.<br>
<p>
The second briefing was all about the information theory and statistical<br>
properties of brains. They talked about how the links of a brain's<br>
neurons had been found to have the same statistical distribution as:<br>
healthy societies, the 1900's telephone system, large massively parallel<br>
supercomputers, N-dimensional hypercubes and several other things I had<br>
never heard of, like "linguistic root-concept networks". They also<br>
talked about the different functional components of the brain and how<br>
quickly each function would begin to feel different as it diffused over<br>
into the new brain.<br>
<p>
&lt;&gt; 4:35 PM<br>
<p>
The doctors gave me a handout from the third session. I'm going to type<br>
it in here so I can recycle the paper.<br>
<p>
    "The artificial brain will be simulated until it reaches the point<br>
    where it is ready to become part of the intelligence wave pattern,<br>
    more precisely called 'the function ring of adaptive entropic<br>
    stimulus/response'.<br>
    <br>
    "The human brain will be connected to the artificial brain by means<br>
    of trillions of connections, between individual neurons -- enough<br>
    connections so that the bisection bandwidth is enough to keep the<br>
    two brains almost completely up to date with each other."<br>
<p>
(I asked about "bisection bandwidth", and the doctors said it measured<br>
how much information, in bits per second, could travel between two<br>
halves of a brain, or a computer network. An old 1990's term, I<br>
remembered right after I asked. In computer architecture we call it<br>
"interchange rate".)<br>
<p>
    "The two brains then begin to interoperate as one brain. Thoughts,<br>
    perceptions, emotions and other similar phenomena begin to occur in<br>
    both halves nearly simultaneously just as they do on the left and<br>
    right halves of a normal brain.<br>
    <br>
    "The human consciousness will start to perceive the actions of the<br>
    artificial brain as part of its consciousness. This will happen<br>
    gradually, like fingers slowly creeping across the 'new callosum'<br>
    and into the other brain. The process is gradual because the new<br>
    neurons take a while to develop new 'wave patterns'. At the<br>
    patient's request or if the neuroanalyst deems necessary, the<br>
    process can be made more gradual by switching on the connections<br>
    gradually.<br>
    <br>
    "The patient starts to get accustomed to his/her new thoughts, as<br>
    each piece of the new brain becomes part of one consciousness. It<br>
    becomes part of you; your senses and actions are directly linked<br>
    through the new parts of the brain as well as the old.<br>
    <br>
    "Cautious patients often worry that the new brain will influence the<br>
    old brain just as much as the old brain influences the new. This<br>
    doesn't happen because the new 'neurons' are initially configured in<br>
    'high learning index' mode, much like the neurons in the speech<br>
    processing centers during the first few years of a child's life. The<br>
    new neurons essentially rewire themselves until they 'realize' that<br>
    they're interoperating in a consistent way. For a technical<br>
    explanation see [ANG:anthro.brain.learn-7:/Salter.Evan/2008a<br>
    ID-6ew4-51aah-401-200-9044,sec7.6ff]<br>
    <br>
    "The 'new corpus callosum' has one end in the computer system the<br>
    patient will communicate with, and the other end in a massive bundle<br>
    of tiny fibers that extends into the brain. The surgeons are<br>
    responsible for making sure that the millions of fibers are<br>
    reasonably evenly distributed throughout all active parts of the<br>
    brain. It doesn't matter precisely where each one ends up as long as<br>
    they're fairly evenly distibuted, because the new brain maps itself<br>
    to all the neural patterns during the neuronal learning process.<br>
    Each fiber picks up signals from twenty thousand points along its<br>
    length, for a total of a few trillion connections. The precise<br>
    number varies by patient.<br>
    <br>
    "The fundamental physical technology dates back to the mid-1900's,<br>
    initially developed as a prosthesis for patients born blind. In<br>
    early operations a mere 100 to 1000 connections were made to the<br>
    visual cortex but the brain quickly learned to derive useful visual<br>
    information and incorporate the signals into its experience."<br>

Had a really nice dinner with Linda tonight. I took her out to the<br>
Italian place on Collins Av, where we went on that midsummer when we met<br>
Andrew. We've been closer and happier these last few days than anytime I<br>
remember since that midsummer. I think she knows what I'm heading into<br>
and really respects me for it. Anyway, I told her about my decision when<br>
we got home, and we had a great night together. It's nice to have her<br>
sleeping so softly next to me.<br>
<p>
&lt;&gt; 2031 April 3rd, Thursday<br>
<p>
They brought the new eyes "on line" today. At first they seemed like a<br>
totally alien input; "a new sense" as the doctors said. I've got this<br>
annoying mess of -- sort of like hallucinations or -- well they're not<br>
sights or sounds anyway, but they're synchronized with what I'm seeing.<br>
I should have done drugs when I had the chance, maybe I'd be able to<br>
describe this if I had experienced synesthesia firsthand.<br>
<p>
Anyway, whatever it is, it dosn't appear as vision, yet! The doctors say<br>
it'll "click" within a few weeks, like when you're learning French and<br>
they throw you into the middle of Lyons or someplace and you have no one<br>
to speak English with anymore. Time will tell.<br>
<p>
&lt;&gt; April 7th, 8:30 AM<br>
<p>
Oh my god -- I have just re-experienced a memory from when I was in the<br>
womb -- I can't describe it at all but I have this gut feeling just like<br>
when my vision started working for the first time. I know it sounds<br>
crazy, but I've felt this before and it's the deepest oldest sensation<br>
I've ever had. I also had that weird "embryo" feeling this morning, like<br>
I felt sometimes during the chemotherapy in 1987. This feels just like<br>
that! Wow, that's cool.<br>
<p>
&lt;&gt; 2031 April 19th, Saturday, 2:58 PM<br>
<p>
With the new headset on I can close my eyes, and I still see! My new<br>
'eyes' are still open. When I turn my head I see different parts of the<br>
world around me. The only drawback right now, is this irritating<br>
sensation that I'm forcing my eyes not to blink, like in a childhood<br>
staring contest. The doctors say it'll go away after a few days on the<br>
headset.<br>
<p>
My hearing is mostly transferred, too. Linda asked me today about the<br>
other senses, like smell and taste. I told her that those senses are<br>
being linked electronically, but there are no physical prostheses so I<br>
won't be able to smell her perfume for example, once they've transferred<br>
the olfactory nerves out of my body -- unless she sets it in the<br>
simulator preferences on the console.<br>
<p>
That didn't help at all. Linda got pretty sad when I said that. I'm<br>
going to start giving her more time to be with me alone, so I can just<br>
listen and be with her. I'll make sure the doctors know how important<br>
this is. We've been through it several times but nothing can prepare you<br>
for the real experience. She needs to face it and she's facing it now<br>
and I'm going to give her my undivided attention.<br>
<p>
&lt;&gt; 2031 May 20th, Tuesday<br>
<p>
They briefed me for the next stage today. Basically the old brain will<br>
be shut down bit by bit. As this is happening I have to take a lot of<br>
time and effort reexperiencing all kinds of memories, emotions, and<br>
thoughts in order to recall the memory contents of my old mind and let<br>
the new mind learn the patterns. The whole process can take up to 7<br>
years! That's a long time for me to have to stay in this wheelchair! I<br>
know I've thought about it for years but it still seems like a big deal.<br>
I guess the last couple months have spoiled me, with so many things<br>
happening so quickly.<br>
<p>
But, the doctors assure me I need to do this, 'memory lane therapy' as<br>
they call it. It's this part of the process, this slow experiencing of<br>
the millions of different thoughts and emotions that really accomplishes<br>
the mind transfer. I'll undergo lots of trauma later if I leave any<br>
large parts of my memory behind. I remember the horror stories of<br>
recovering Alzheimer's patients 20 years ago!<br>
<p>
Again I'm glad I kept such detailed journals, particularly during the<br>
90's and 2000's. Those are years I will always cherish. Linda has found<br>
me some more monthly documentaries of national and world history,<br>
including a great series for the 1970's. I hope so -- nobody I've<br>
watched so far really did justice to that period.<br>
<p>
&lt;&gt; 2032 October 23rd, Saturday, 11:00 AM<br>
<p>
I just finished reliving the Sterling Men's Weekend today! It was the<br>
Simmons-Thomas adaptation, with all my journal notes woven into the<br>
holoplay by Andrew's studio, and level 3 subliminal prompting. Anyway,<br>
IT WAS AWESOME!!! and I'm glad I decided to do this, a great way to<br>
spend my 69th birthday indeed! Linda was impressed. I still wish I had<br>
her with me the first time I completed the Weekend, and I think now she<br>
understands why. If not, well... she soon will! O-8<br>

"We are here today to pay our respects to the mortal remains of David<br>
Jensen, comrade, friend, lover, husband, father.<br>
<p>
"Those who share David's beliefs, that he lives on in the ether world,<br>
pay tribute to this body that served him so well until he was able to<br>
move on.<br>
<p>
"And those who are spiritual, be assured that David's spirit lives on,<br>
and was if anything, honored by the attention David gave to try to<br>
remain with his friends and family, helping loving and serving all those<br>
who were close to him.<br>
<p>
"And all together, be assured in your own way and do not weep for David,<br>
for even now he smiles and stands among us. And in your own turn, you<br>
may step forward and tell the assembly how you will preserve his legacy.<br>
<p>
"David, above all you taught me the importance of being clear on my<br>
purpose, being courageous and giving 100 percent. I will pass that on to<br>
others as I continue my life!<br>
<p>
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. What was, is gone, and what is, shall go,<br>
but all shall come again. May the spirits bless you all for all of your<br>
days. Amen."<br>

<p>
Preparing my summary statement for the Ether Society SIG, New Candidates<br>
Introduction. My 125th prepared public speech, near as I can tell. What<br>
a great life I've had! No, what a great life I've *started*!<br>
<p>
You will live in a distributed redundant multiprocessing system, on<br>
several computers around the world, along with many others like you. The<br>
computers still need to be maintained physically, and many human beings<br>
who do not wish to forego their mortality are happy to do so. The<br>
symbiosis between the mortals and the immortals is nearly perfect.<br>
<p>
The immortals vacate the planet, freeing the environment and physical<br>
space for the remaining mortals to live in greater comfort. Earthers<br>
finally get the smaller population they've been fighting so long to get.<br>
The immortals earn their keep by continuing to invent and create,<br>
solving more and more of the remaining problems of the mortals. As their<br>
minds multiply the invention rate increases.<br>
<p>
The mortals, while sacrificing immortality and burdened with physical<br>
work (which nevertheless decreases with passing years as the immortals<br>
continue to invent more automation and efficiency), are blessed with the<br>
simple physical life they love and believe in. They can bear children<br>
the old fashioned way, and their children live into a choice that they<br>
can take when they're ready -- remain mortal and risk death, or transfer<br>
and become immortal.<br>
<p>
It is proposed that a substantial number of humans will form a third<br>
class, of mortal humans who are linked to the etherworld through<br>
computer implants. We still don't have good technology for doing this<br>
without confining them to some sort of wheelchair, but many consider<br>
that no problem. This third class becomes dependent on both the physical<br>
world *and* the etherworld, and provides the important services of<br>
diplomacy and policing the balance of power between the mortals and the<br>
immortals. It is in their best interests that the symbiosis continue and<br>
neither side "defeat" the other. Much like the checks and balances of<br>
the three branches of American government, the three classes of people<br>
cooperate to maintain a working global society.<br>
<p>
Within the etherworld, many new possibilities will develop. Trek fans --<br>
remember the Holodeck? It is one of the *simpler* things you could do!<br>
Individual minds begin to discover that they can share thoughts, and<br>
even combine if they wish, with other minds. A new type of marriage,<br>
much more powerful than anything possible in the mortal world, occurs<br>
when two minds irrevocably merge into one -- greater than the sum of the<br>
original two. This new, greater intelligence can do things neither of<br>
the two could do alone, much faster and more efficiently than the two<br>
could do working together as partners. One can imagine this merging<br>
process continuing, producing larger and larger intelligences... Can you<br>
imagine yourself one day saying:<br>
<p>
    "I will no longer be much compared to one of these merged<br>
    intelligences. No matter how smart I am on my own, these larger<br>
    intelligences are smarter! Eventually I'll see that my personal<br>
    pride isn't worth it -- after all, I'm not doing much at all<br>
    compared to one of *them*!"<br>
<p>
Alternately, two individuals may retain their seperate consciousness but<br>
choose to create a new intelligence, trained by both of them -- a child.<br>
The neuroscientists learned that it takes 7 years (normalized to the<br>
year 2000, or about 4.1 years today) to train the new intelligence<br>
enough to consider it an adult. The natural human generation time has<br>
gone from 14 or 15 down to 7.<br>
<p>
The mortals will have one unique experience that we might never enjoy<br>
ourselves -- watching the other half of their society accelerate and<br>
ultimately reach lightning speed. As computing speed continues to<br>
improve, everyone gets more processing time for their money, and no-one<br>
foregoes the opportunity to keep up with everyone else. The<br>
child-training process becomes faster (in real time). The human<br>
generation time continues to decrease. Generations come more and more<br>
quickly. As the population grows, invention happens faster and computing<br>
speed evolves more quickly too. To the immortals, this speeding up won't<br>
be happening -- as if traveling at near the speed of light -- they'll<br>
see the physical world *slowing down*.<br>
<p>
For those still waiting to decide if they want to step over, just<br>
remember: you *can* take it with you. Everything you are doing now is<br>
useful if it can ultimately be transferred into etherspace. Your<br>
posessions are useful if they can be digitized, photographed, or<br>
otherwise brought over. Your home TV movies and journals of all kinds<br>
will be very useful; they will provide the immortals with a way of going<br>
back into the old world and visualizing what it was like.<br>
<p>
&lt;&gt; Ether 2063.10.23,09:30 (Earth GMT: 2050 Jan 11th)<br>
<p>
Hey Jeff, hope things are going well. Yeah I know I didn't write back<br>
when I said I would. I'll give you 50 as soon as I'm off link.<br>
<p>
Today's the big day: I'm 100 years old. Of course, I keep reminding<br>
Linda that back on Earth I'm only 86 (and she's barely 85!). Anyway,<br>
we're spending the day in the holoprogram I picked out last spring, the<br>
Las Vegas Luxor honeymoon suite, circa 1995. The rest of Linda's<br>
presents are -- appropriate to the setting. That's all I'll say here.<br>
Even in Etherspace there are circles of confidentiality.<br>
<p>
So, let me know when you're coming across. (-: Ha ha, only serious. I<br>
really *do* get that you're ready for it though. I wouldn't say it if I<br>
didn't! Anyway, there's an open house at 4:00 PM on the 18th, your time.<br>
I'd love to have you there.<br>
<p>
Call back anytime, I'll set the machine if it's nighttime. You've got a<br>
day or else it's *your* 50! (-:  See ya, jerk<br>
