 Dan makes more good points:<br>
<i> &gt;&gt;I think having some sort of 'support system' increases the stability of a</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;society </i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;While stability cannot be measured, I would agree with you that a support</i><br>
<i> &gt;system does increase stability. However, stability and growth may not be</i><br>
<i> &gt;related; they may even share an inverse relationship.</i><br>
<p>
If you can convince a few big investors of this I'll buy it (I'm talking<br>
about banks and such, they seem to know something about where to put<br>
money). I've always understood most investors like stabile, predictable,<br>
environments.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Remember, the only investment which actually improves growth is </i><br>
<i> &gt;that which (at least) pays for itself.</i><br>
<p>
(sorry to be such a pain in the butt ;-) but: we then also have to take<br>
into account how 'cost' is determined. People rioting in LA are causing<br>
cost to individuals and companies that _may_ have been avoided if their<br>
standard of living was better. These cost are now being paid by a limited<br>
selection of people (who happened to own a store in the wrong<br>
neighborhood). Is that fair? You seem to agree with me that stability may<br>
have value (even though we can't put a price-tag on it).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Another strategy might be to just leave welfare in place until mind</i><br>
<i> &gt;uploading and/or other immortalizing technologies become affordable to</i><br>
<i> &gt;everyone (or at least subsidizable). That way, when we did finally shut</i><br>
<i> &gt;down welfare, no one would die as a result.</i><br>
<p>
That would certainly seem to be the nicest option. I also agree with<br>
Dalibor den Otter that making a basic living standard freely available for<br>
everyone could be a nice way to keep things stable as more and more persons<br>
become obsolete through automation. The cost of this should become less and<br>
less untill it becomes insignificant.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;While this seems more appealing at first, keep in mind the costs of</i><br>
<i> &gt;implementing this solution: unless/until we develop these technologies,</i><br>
<i> &gt;EVERYONE is going to die, no matter how much they make annually. If</i><br>
<i> &gt;anything, it seems we should take our foot off the brakes NOW so as to</i><br>
<i> &gt;reach immortality as quickly as possible, if our goal is to minimize death.</i><br>
<p>
Yes but who's death when? <br>
Two more questions (and I can only hope they're good ;-)<br>
<p>
I'm not at all sure that funds freed by abolishing welfare systems will end<br>
up being invested in immortality research. Won't it simply go largly into<br>
bigger cars, vacations and onther nice goodies?<br>
<p>
And there is the fact that advancing research is not purely an financial<br>
question. 'Law of diminishing returns' is the correct engglish term I<br>
think. Pumping twice as much funding into a program won't speed it up a<br>
factor two (it might but there's no guarantee). Based on what I hear from<br>
neurological research this seems to be especially true for medical sciences<br>
(as opposed to stuff like space exploration).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Ah, well.  Hope I've contributed well to the debate.</i><br>
<p>
Yes you have (that is to say at least I'm learning something).<br>
<p>
