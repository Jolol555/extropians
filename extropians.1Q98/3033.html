<i>&gt; Francisco. We can apply for Aid To Families With Dependent Children. This</i><br>

<i>&gt; an easily-demonstrable way, or addicted to a substance in a way that</i><br>
<i>&gt; impairs your ability to work. So welfare money, like most money, goes to</i><br>

Yes, however I think he was more interested in the Earned Income Tax Credit. If<br>
you have one or more dependents and make less than I beleive $23,000 a year<br>
(correct me if I'm wrong), then there is a sliding scale to figure out your tax<br>
return, which in many cases gives you back more than you paid in over the year.<br>
My little brother, for instance, a learning disabled individual (severe<br>
dyslexia) who works as a chef, makes between $10,000-$15,000 a year, and got<br>
$2650 back in his tax return (he has one son) which is at the very least several<br>
hundred dollars more than the total amount withheld from his pay for the year.<br>
<p>
So not only does this provide additional income redistribution, but it also<br>
helps poor people save money which they may use to help them better their<br>
situation. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. While my brother bought a<br>
pickup truck (the return came in just as the chassis on his old one broke<br>
turning his old pickup into a wallet), many people I have heard of getting this<br>
return will typically spend it on durgs or booze, or vacations.<br>
<p>
While I'm not one to advocate government dictating people's personal lives,<br>
considering its my taxes that is being paid into these people's pockets, I think<br>
that they should only be able to spend the money on either education or personal<br>
transportation.<br>
