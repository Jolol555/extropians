<i>&gt;</i><br>
Your last few lines beg the question: why did you develop this attitude,<br>
while your brother did not?  Maybe there is no answer to this question?<br>
Or perhaps there was some defining event in your life that set you on a<br>
different course? Whatever the reason, thank you for a very interesting<br>
post.<br>
