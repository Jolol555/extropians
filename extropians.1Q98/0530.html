This discussion is quite amusing; akin to the sometimes-used creationist<br>
argument for God that because the earth is at the very nice distance<br>
from the sun which allows our type of life form, this was obviously by<br>
design. The reason the argument is meaningless is because life is only<br>
going to develop under conditions which enable this development. Now our<br>
type of life, naturally, has evolved to be best suited to our proximity<br>
to the sun. This reasoning can be extended to the universal constants:<br>
of course they appear to us to be finely tuned - because we evolved<br>
under their influence. Just because we find it hard to comprehend forms<br>
of life which might exist under alternate conditions does not mean that<br>
this is not so. But of course, this is moot, because even if our<br>
conditions _are_ the only ones that allow life, of course the life which<br>
does develop is going to do so under these conditions. If they were not<br>
- we would not be here to ponder the question. Am I making sense? Is<br>
this reasoning valid?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; this seeming coincidence is to say that our universe was</i><br>
<i>&gt; intentionally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; created to have parameters in this region.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which hypothesis is simpler, that the parameters of this universe are</i><br>

<i>&gt; question can be formalized as "what is the shortest program that</i><br>
<i>&gt; outputs</i><br>
<i>&gt; the parameters of this universe?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course there are many such programs, but let's just consider two</i><br>
<i>&gt; categories corresponding to the two hypotheses. A program of the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind consists of the parameters stored as constants and a single Print</i><br>
<i>&gt; statement that outputs them. A program of the second kind involves the</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolution of an intelligent being which then does various computation</i><br>
<i>&gt; to</i><br>
<i>&gt; figure out the optimal parameters for a universe to have our kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; life. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the shortest program is of the first kind, it would mean that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; parameters of this universe are essentially random and have no simpler</i><br>
<i>&gt; explanation. If the shortest program is of the second kind, then the</i><br>
<i>&gt; simplest explanation for the parameters being what they are is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they</i><br>
<i>&gt; were chosen by an intelligent being.</i><br>
