<i>&gt; &gt;In almost everything you write.  You spend pages and pages</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;on defining "Identity" and claim that this is an exercise</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of reason in itself.  You can have your definition if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;like--it's no skin off my nose.  But the old definition--</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;even if it's "wrong" in some sense--manages to feed me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;build houses, move me around, and generally make my life</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;interesting.  If you want us to accept your definition,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;show us how using your definition /accomplishes/ something</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;tangible and real in my life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; WARNING: Someone could perfectly have told the same things to Einstein,</i><br>
<i>&gt; when he was talking about relativity X newtonian... (but it is not the case</i><br>
<i>&gt; in this particular discussion...: Even Einstein used the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Identity"definition...)</i><br>
<p>
Exactly; people did say that, and they were entirely correct.  So<br>
Al used his theory to make specific, measurable predictions about<br>
real things--and those predictions came true, and the rest is<br>
history.  He didn't just say "Newton is wrong" and expect people<br>
to buy his flawless logic--even though it was flawless.  He said<br>
"look, if I'm right, you'll see these stars out of place when they<br>
go near the sun by this amount..." and they were.  He predicted<br>
that matter would form dense super-atoms at a certain pressure,<br>
and now, decades after his death, we've done exactly that.  Even<br>
if Einstein had been "right" in some philosophical sense, if he<br>
had never made measurable predictions about the physical world,<br>
all his brilliant logic would be no more than masturbation.<br>
