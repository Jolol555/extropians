<p>
I don't know, what did (do?) they target in the USSR, Eastern europe and<br>
china?  Why not La Habana?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and how would they explain the fallout to the powerful independant</i><br>

<p>
I think that the US has shown enough times that they don't give a fuck<br>
about what a bunch of centroamericans think.  What would they have said to<br>
western europe had they bombed the east?<br>
My main point is, do you positively know that Cuba wasn't targeted, or are<br>
you just guessing like me?<br>
