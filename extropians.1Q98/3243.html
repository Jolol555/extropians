<i>&gt;&gt;From today's Washington Post book review section.  A bit of news in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the last two sentences:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;BODY AND SOUL ON ICE</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cryonics is still in its infancy when Dr. Benjamin Franklin Smith </i><br>
<i>&gt;decides to invest his future in it.  He has the money;  he wants to </i><br>
<i>&gt;be resurrected in a future capable of overcoming age and disease.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Naturally, when he 'dies,' his family wants an autopsy and challenges </i><br>
<i>&gt;his will.</i><br>
<i>&gt;So far _The First Immortal_ by James L. Halperin fells like a mainstream </i><br>
<i>&gt;courtroom drama.  Up to the trial, Halperin has focused rather </i><br>
<i>&gt;convincingly on Dr. Smith's troubled relationship with his family.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;However, once Smith has been safely put on cryonic ice, the character </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the book changes to one of brave new optimism.  While the doctor </i><br>
<i>&gt;sleeps on, the world strides boldly into a glittering utopia, and, as </i><br>
<i>&gt;he hoped, technology arrives in time to resurrect him (sufficient </i><br>
<i>&gt;funds rather than personal merit being his savior).</i><br>
<i>&gt;At the end of this novel come seven pages enthusing about cryonics, </i><br>
<i>&gt;with a bibliography, hopeful possibilities and encouragement.  The </i><br>
<i>&gt;author says in the introduction that his book 'might well be the most </i><br>
<i>&gt;thoroughly researched and scritinized novel ever written about our </i><br>
<i>&gt;potential for biological immortality.'  The publisher says that _The </i><br>
<i>&gt;First Immortal_ is 'soon to be a television mini-series.'  Will the </i><br>
<i>&gt;sponsors be cryonic-vault companies?</i><br>
<p>
The implication seems to be that cryonics is for the rich, and that<br>
"cryonics-vault companies" are making money. Such ignorance!<br>
I haven't read the book, though. Did Halperin focus on funding that<br>
much?<br>
