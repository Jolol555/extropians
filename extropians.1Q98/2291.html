<i>&gt;&gt;transhumanism. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Some transhumans are artists. Their work, as professionals or as hobbyists,</i><br>
<i>&gt;is very dear to them. Their art provides them with a venue to explore and</i><br>
<i>&gt;expose ideas -- a means to express their views of transhumanity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What is the significance of science by transhumans? What is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;significance of developing technologies by transhumans? What is the point</i><br>
<i>&gt;of writing transhuman science fiction, or transhuman non-fiction? What is</i><br>
<i>&gt;the point for designing healthy foods, or working out? What is the point of</i><br>
<i>&gt;living, for that matter?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: Natasha asks all the right questions that spontaneously <br>
   answer themselves (talk about efficient!).  But at the same <br>
   time Doug raises an important question that pertains to the <br>
   meaning of transhuman. I think that the answer here is that <br>
   "transhumanization" is not equivalent to "dehumanization," <br>
   even though such an equivalence can be extrapolated from <br>
   the term "transhuman."<br>
<p>
   To become transhuman need not imply becoming dehumanized. <br>
   What is the point of living forever is all sensory pleasure <br>
   is nullified? I suspect that our desire to live revolves <br>
   around the desire to experience more pleasure and joy. Art <br>
   is joy. And "art" is more that graphics: to the mathematician<br>
   math is more than empty numbers, to the mathematician there <br>
   is beauty and thus joy and de facto art in the math. So "art"<br>
   is far more than the class of things commonly called "art." <br>
<p>
   A broader definition of art could be: an ordering of elements<br>
   that invokes sensual experience, generally pleasurable exper-<br>
   ience. Recently I vacationed in Naples, Florida, and walking <br>
   around those fabulous homes and trees I realized that I was <br>
   walking in art, I realized that what made the area I was in<br>
   so "high class" and beautiful was simply the artistic, and as<br>
   such sensually pleasurable, ordering of all the atoms in the <br>
   area. If you took all those same atoms and scrambled them <br>
   up, it could be a mess, a slop house. So art is an ordering<br>
   of elements the sum of which produces a sensual experience;<br>
   a sensual experience that would not exist if all those same<br>
   elements assumed a different order. In that respect, art <br>
   transcends the physical entities of which it is composed,<br>
   and in some way that is also what transhumanism is about.<br>
<p>
   Life without joy, life without art, is not life, and there-<br>
   fore an eternal life without "art" is not an eternal life. <br>
   So I think the point here, with respect to the mechanics of <br>
   transcendence, is that the uploaded human that is uploaded <br>
   into a system that does not allow for the experience of joy,<br>
   is as good as dead. I suspect that you cannot be a computer,<br>
   and therefore some giant steps forward are necessary before <br>
   the full transhumanist ideal can become a plausible reality.<br>
   And it stands to reason that an understanding of what is art <br>
   is an integral feature of understanding what it is to be a<br>
   human and thus what it will take to become a transhuman.<br>

 IDENTITY MATRIX | I D E N T I T Y    C O N S E R V A T I O N <br>
-----------------| The basis of  logic is  identity (ID). The<br>
     1  2  3     | basis of ID is difference. Degrees of dif-<br>
    _________    | ference can be quantified as ID units. The<br>
 1 | 0  1  2 |   | ID Matrix shows the ID units of three num-<br>
<i>   |         |   | bers,  and may do so unto infinity. The ID</i><br>
 2 |-1  0  1 |   | units of each  number are derived from the<br>
<i>   |         |   | others, and therefore ID is  holistic  not</i><br>
 3 |-2 -1  0 |   | atomistic. As the sum of all ID units unto <br>
   -----------   | infinity equals 0,  identity is conserved.<br>
