<i>&gt; &gt;We'll need, among other things:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;1. some extropian billionaires to initial finnancial support.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That makes it easy!  (I'm being ironic for those who don't know.:)</i><br>
You don't need billionaires to buy your own island state. I've seen <br>
a relatively recent documentary about a bunch of English folks <br>
who wanted to do just this, and they could buy a relatively big island<br>
off the coast of Panama or so for about 30.000.000 (I think dollars).<br>
The required financial imput per perseon/family would have to be about <br>
a million, considering the size of the group. This is certainly feasible<br>
for middle class folks who sell their house etc. Although this particular<br>
attempt resulted in nothing (the moral high-horse "leader" of the group,<br>
that wanted an island "free of criminals, drugs, child molesters etc."<br>
turned out to be a child molester himself, but by then the project had<br>
already failed because it lacked good organization, and the island that<br>
was to be bought turned out to be a dumpsite for US chemical weapons)<br>
there were some interesting things:<br>
--several countries were very eager to sell one (or more) of their islands to <br>
an autonomous group, they really don't care about your beliefs as long as <br>
you bring money<br>
--buying an island is not only for the super rich, a relatively small group<br>
of normal-income folks can do it. Apart from this, you could set up a<br>
special project to finance things (and don't use borrowed money --<br>
it's always trouble).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;2. chose a small site in, f.ex., Africa, which we could buy... ( They need</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;money and we need a place...).</i><br>
Africa is a bit politically unstable and has some very nasty diseases etc.<br>
One of the islands of the Seychelles on the other hand :-) ...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I don't like crowds.  Imagine lots of protechs in one place and a neoLuddite</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a large bomb...</i><br>
Of course you keep a low profile, and have some defences. Nobody's going<br>
to drop bombs on an obscure island with a couple of hundred technofreaks/<br>
immortailsts, unless you give them a very good reason. Besides, I don't<br>
think that the majority of transhumanists would want to move to this place<br>
permanently. Most would just come over for visits (to have some uninhibited<br>
fun &amp; networking) or to die (hassle-free cryo suspensions etc.) Bombing the<br>
island would _not_ wipe out the transhuman community, and I don't think<br>
the luddite scumballs would even bother to get bombs and go all the way<br>
to this resort-like place to blow it up (you need a *lot* of explosives  and<br>
good co-ordination for something like this. It's not like posting a mail bomb). <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; But seriously, we might exhaust valuable effort in trying to attain such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; state.  Much better/cheaper to focus on recruiting new people to our</i><br>
<i>&gt; ranks AND developing better tech/science/philosophy/art in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; interim.  Don't (all of) you agree?</i><br>
One idea doesn't exclude another. I think we could use a place with a <br>
all-out extropic culture. It's fun (do anything as long as you don't harm others<br>
against their will) and very practical (place for "controversial" research,<br>
cryonics, safe haven in case of global war/other disaster etc.) Spreading<br>
the risks...<br>

Great idea! How much does such an oil tanker cost? You could also buy a<br>
relatively worthless island (no vegetation etc.) and permanently anker your<br>
ship(s) alongside it, and connect everything. You'd have a homeland that's<br>
at least partially unsinkable ;) My personal favourite would be a high luxury<br>
cruiseship the size of the biggest supertanker...kind of like that Freedom Ship<br>
City thing, only smarter designed.<br>
