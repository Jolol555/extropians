<i>&gt; I grew up near DC, and the only food I ate for my first 18 years was fruits</i><br>
<i>&gt; fruits and vegetables grown in the garden in my parents back yard...</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can probably imagine what happened when I left home for college and my</i><br>
<i>&gt; diet became full of preservatives (institutional food, fast food,</i><br>
<i>&gt; restaurant food). Yes, for almost two years I was unable to keep most food</i><br>
<i>&gt; in my system and became a target for every flu and cold imaginable...</i><br>
<i>&gt; The point being, we are poisioning ourselves with all the crap added...</i><br>
<i>&gt; If we all put in gardens and ate what we grew, we'd be a lot healthier,</i><br>
<p>
Your anecdote gives me exactly the opposite conclusion; your immune<br>
system was underdeveloped because your early diet was insufficiently<br>
diverse.  Your body only had to deal with the microbes in your yard,<br>
so it never developed antobodies for other common bacteria in food.<br>
When you encountered many such foods all at once, naturally you<br>
became sick.<br>
<p>
Our health would not be improved by similarly limiting our diets to<br>
what we grew (nor would the financial disadvantage of such a wasteful<br>
practice be without health consequences).  /Your/ health would have<br>
been much more robust if your diet had been more varied as a child.<br>
Children who travel a lot, in particular, have strong immune systems<br>
from having experienced the marvellous variety of bugs our planet<br>
has to offer.<br>
