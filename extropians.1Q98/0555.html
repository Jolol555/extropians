That must be the greatest understatement of all time because I don't think <br>
the human mind is able to conceive of a more difficult question.  <br>
I have about as much chance of correctly answering that as pigs have of <br>
flying, so I will focus on a much simpler, though still very difficult  <br>
question. What general form would the answer have to be in for it to be <br>
satisfactory?  Clearly "the universe exists because it should" is not  <br>
satisfactory because it implies the existence of ethical laws and existence  <br>
is what we are trying to prove in the first place. The anthropomorphic answer  <br>
that the universe must exist or we wouldn't be here to ask the question, <br>
is true but just begs the question, why are we here? Any answer in the form   <br>
"the universe  exists because of X " will never satisfy us because it  <br>
immediately suggests another very obvious unanswered question.<br>
<p>
The only halfway adequate way to explain it is if it could be shown that  <br>
"nothing" was somehow self contradictory so there must be "something".  <br>
Needless to say I have no idea how to do this. Even in this case however it  <br>
assumes the existence of logical laws, such as the law forbidding  <br>
contradictions. Being logically self consistent doesn't prove a thing's  <br>
existence (or does it?), so why does being self inconsistent prove it doesn't <br>
exist?  <br>
<p>
I love logic, I think it's useful in solving all problems, except this one.  <br>
I don't know if the question even makes sense. The first word of this question  <br>
is "why" which means " what is the reason". Reason implies logic and logic is  <br>
something. So we are asked to find a logical reason for reality, but clearly  <br>
we can't use logic to find it, after all, that would  be illogical. This sort  <br>
of thing could give circular reasoning a bad name because it's totally <br>
without meaning.  <br>
<p>
Or is it? All the definitions in a dictionary are made of words, and those  <br>
words also have definitions made of other words also in the dictionary, <br>
and round and round we go. Is a dictionary totally without meaning? <br>
I suppose that all depends on what meaning means, and what the meaning of<br>
meaning means, and what the meaning of the meaning of meaning means, and...<br>
<p>
Ok, now that I've made everything clear as a bell we can move on.<br>
