<i>&gt; Seems to me it has exactly the same</i><br>

<i>&gt; obtain absolute truth from your One</i><br>
<i>&gt; True Open Network (OTON) because if</i><br>
<i>&gt; the entire world's operation is based</i><br>
<i>&gt; on it's information then people would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have enormous incentive to shape that</i><br>
<i>&gt; information and change "the truth" to</i><br>
<i>&gt; their liking.</i><br>
<p>
The wonders of hyperlinking and massive abstraction make that<br>
impossible, every bit of information is tide to every other bit of<br>
information.  Change one piece of history and you've got to change it<br>
all.  Besides, this is an autonomous meta network, everything you do<br>
creates additional data.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since everything is open I know exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; how OTON works and all about its</i><br>
<i>&gt; security, I can hack in and alter</i><br>
<i>&gt; records and make history be anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; I want.</i><br>
<p>
Well you can't hack in because it has nothing to hack into (it's open,<br>
remember?).  You can't change history for the reasons above.  You<br>
could try and destroy the data but it's completely distributed, which<br>
makes things very hard to find.  You could try to orgainise somekind<br>
of anti-openess conspiracy, but the majority of people have more to<br>
gain from openess than from privacy (i.e. losers.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It does no good to make an</i><br>
<i>&gt; exception to the total openness policy</i><br>
<i>&gt; for OTON itself because that's by far</i><br>
<i>&gt; the most important thing in the world</i><br>
<i>&gt; and if that's not open nothing is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; besides, although you might reduce the</i><br>
<i>&gt; risk from hackers you'd vastly increase</i><br>
<i>&gt; the meddling of the truth from world </i><br>
<i>&gt; leaders, that is, from the network</i><br>
<i>&gt; administrators. </i><br>
<p>
There's are no network administrators, it's completely distributed<br>
autonomous anarchy.<br>
                    <br>
<i>&gt; A good one key encryption algorithm,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the sort you'd use to store information</i><br>
<i>&gt; on a hard disk, slows things down by</i><br>
<i>&gt; very little.  Public key encryption is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a little slower but still not bad and</i><br>
<i>&gt; machines are getting so fast you'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; soon never notice the slowdown.</i><br>
<p>
But the data must be machine-readable.<br>
<p>
For the sake of argument, let's say you managed secret communication. <br>
Who would you send communicate with?  What would you say?  Do you<br>
think you can organise people against the network?  What are you going<br>
to stop?  What can you steal from an open society?  How can you bribe<br>
an open society?  What have you got that they haven't?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Anyway, what are you hiding?</i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
<i>&gt; If I told you I'd have to kill you. </i><br>
<i>&gt; (:&gt;)</i><br>
