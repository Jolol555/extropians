<i>        &gt;Freedom of choice for humans does not mean acting at random like        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the Dice Man; that would be psychosis, not freedom. </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
True, except that it wouldn't even be psychosis because even insanity has a <br>
cause, it would just be convulsions. I agree with the previous poster who <br>
said in effect that first we must define what free will is, then we can <br>
debate if human beings have this interesting property or not. <br>
I gave my definition:<br>
<p>
 A man, animal or machine has free will if it can not always predict what it <br>
 will do in the future even if the external environment is constant. A third <br>
 party might be able to make such predictions but that's irrelevant, the <br>
 important thing is that the person himself can not know what he will do next <br>
 until he actually does it.<br>
<p>
I maintain that this definition is clear, internally consistent and produces <br>
no contradictions when used with most everyday uses of the word "free". <br>
I've never heard of another definition that could do as well.  <br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;our consciousness or ego is a module (either executive or         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;interpretative) with very restricted information about the full         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;state of the self. </i><br>
                <br>
I agree.<br>
                <br>
<i>        &gt;This means that when we opt, we do so from many more `unconscious'         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;motives </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
I have no argument with Freud, there are factors in our mind that we aren't  <br>
conscious of, but there are other things that effect our behavior that aren't  <br>
even "unconscious", they are not in the brain at all because they have not  <br>
been calculated yet. I think this is intimately related to Alan Turing's<br>
discovery that a computer program has free will, that is, it can't understand <br>
itself, that is, it can't (we can't either) predict if it will ever stop. <br>
<p>
Let me suggest a thought experiment; a man is walking down a road and spots a <br>
fork in the road far ahead. He knows of advantages and disadvantages to both <br>
paths so he isn't sure if he will go right or left, he hadn't decided. Now <br>
imagine a powerful demon able to look into the man's head and quickly deduce <br>
that he would eventually choose to go to the left. Meanwhile the man, whose <br>
mind works much more slowly than the demon's, hasn't completed the thought <br>
process yet. He might be saying to himself I haven't decided I'll have to <br>
think about it, I'm free to go either way. From his point of view he is <br>
correct, even a robot does not feel like a robot, but from the demon's <br>
viewpoint it's a different matter, he simply deduced a purely mechanical <br>
operation that can have only one outcome.   <br>
<p>
But is it really a purely mechanical operation, what about the uncertainty <br>
principal? I don't see how it effects matters one way or another. It says <br>
that some things can happen for no cause and thus are truly random, but <br>
happenstance is the very opposite of intelligence and even emotion. Things <br>
either happen because of cause and  effect or they don't and if they don't <br>
then they are by definition random and have nothing to due with volition.<br>
Those who claim that this is the  source of the will must also believe that a <br>
nickel has free will when you  flip it. This topic muddies the question but <br>
does not change it.<br>
<p>
In my example the demon did not tell the man of his prediction but now lets <br>
pretend he did. Suppose also that the man, being of an argumentative nature, <br>
was determined to do the exact opposite of what the demon predicted. Now our <br>
poor demon would be in a familiar predicament. Because the demon's decision <br>
influences the man's actions the demon must forecast his own behavior, but he <br>
will have no better luck in this regard than the man did and for the same <br>
reasons. What we would need in a situation like this is a mega-demon able to <br>
look into the demon's head. Now the mega-demon would have the problem.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I think that the more we make our values `our own', the more free we         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;feel - that is, against your claim that we would feel like robots.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
My claim was that self knowledge would make us feel like robots but we don't  <br>
have to worry about it because self knowledge is impossible, I don't see what <br>
that has to do with deciding we like a value and adopting it.<br>
<p>
Let's simplify things to their essentials. Imagine a world in which the <br>
environment was so simple it could be predicted with complete accuracy. <br>
Doubtless we would find such a place boring and unpleasant but I don't think <br>
we would feel like robots. Thus the origin of the sensation of autonomy can <br>
not be external. What does it mean to "feel like a robot"? If you could <br>
always forecast your own behavior and thoughts with complete accuracy then <br>
you would feel like a  robot. Subjective (not objective) uncertainty is at <br>
the root of freedom and  choice. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;John Clark wrote at random, that is, freely (by his own account):</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I like to think it wasn't random but it was certainly free by my definition. <br>
When I read your post there were several ways I could have responded to it,  <br>
when I sat down at my computer I had all the information I needed but I didn't <br>
know what I would do, I could have written many things, I had to think about <br>
it, I was free, in fact, I wasn't absolutely sure how it would come out until <br>
right NOW.<br>
