<p>
<p>
  IAN: Semantic closure, yes, in that the <br>
  boundary of identity is merely a product<br>
  of semantics, of words, of utility, and <br>
  as such is ultimately an illusion. No<br>
  question that placing limits on identity<br>
  is useful in the process of communication.<br>
  But my effort is to map the reality beyond<br>
  the words we impose on things, and I believe<br>
  that that reality is what the "mystics" speak<br>
  of: a unified and holistic identity unbounded<br>
  by the illusory and self-serving categories <br>
  that the mind imposes on reality. We become<br>
  so attached to our categories, they become<br>
  more real than the reality we impose them<br>
  upon, to a large extent because the mind<br>
  IS the process of categorizing and thus<br>
  IS those categories. To see that which<br>
  lies beyond the mind, its words and<br>
  categories, is to see the truth.<br>
<p>
  I believe that this truth is as logical<br>
  as the system of categories we impose <br>
  on the universe; in fact, I think that <br>
  the underlying holistic reality, even as <br>
  it tends by its very nature to defy logic,<br>
  is, once we can grasp it, more logical than<br>
  the system of categories we impose on it.<br>
<p>
  As to "autopoiesis," which I guess would be <br>
  loosely  defined as a system that is self-de-<br>
  fining, even that is an expression of holistic <br>
  identity. When we define a region of space as A,<br>
  we  simultaneously define a region of space that<br>
  is not-A. We know what A is and define it as such<br>
  only because and only if we also know what it is <br>
  not.  So even the most sharply defined category <br>
  confirms holistic identity, and thus holistic <br>
  identity is always true, and atomism is never <br>
  true, but always assumed, always semantics. <br>
<p>
  It's probable that because holism is always<br>
  true, and thus there is no not-holism, that<br>
  that is exactly why holism is nearly imposs-<br>
  ible to grasp... by its own rule it disappears<br>
  and defies perfect description. Holism defies<br>
  the perfect perception of holism because of <br>
  holism. It must therefore keep breaking down<br>
  into parts, into atoms, into entities, into +<br>
  and - , into universes, into us. But if we add<br>
  up all the parts and map the structure of their<br>
  identities, we can see the self-hiding holistic<br>
  reality and map the structure of absolute truth.<br>
<p>
<p>
  A CONTRADICTION? NO!<br>
<p>
  One might say that if holism asserts that A is <br>
  true if and only if A and not-A, and if holism <br>
  is 100% true  such that there is no not-holism,<br>
  then holism contradicts itself. How can holism<br>
  survive this apparent contradiction?  By the<br>
  logical necessity that the holistic reality is<br>
  zero. If there is 1 there is -1 (ad infinitum),<br>
  and the holistic sum is zero:<br>
<p>
        0 = (...-1 &lt;---0---&gt; +1...) = 0<br>
<p>
  The number system describes the absolute truth.<br>
  So there is 100% 0, since the sum of all entities<br>
  (which defines "the whole") equals zero. Zero keeps<br>
  breaking into +1 and -1, which are "not-zero" and <br>
  yet also zero. So zero is zero and not-zero, the <br>
  whole is whole and not-whole, which means the <br>
  whole is the whole and yet is also composed <br>
  of parts. In this way, holism (A=~A) is <br>
  always true since atomism is holism.<br>

 IDENTITY MATRIX | I D E N T I T Y    C O N S E R V A T I O N <br>
-----------------| The basis of  logic is  identity (ID). The<br>
     1  2  3     | basis of ID is difference. Degrees of dif-<br>
    _________    | ference can be quantified as ID units. The<br>
 1 | 0  1  2 |   | ID Matrix shows the ID units of three num-<br>
<i>   |         |   | bers,  and may do so unto infinity. The ID</i><br>
 2 |-1  0  1 |   | units of each  number are derived from the<br>
<i>   |         |   | others, and therefore ID is  holistic  not</i><br>
 3 |-2 -1  0 |   | atomistic. As the sum of all ID units unto <br>
   -----------   | infinity equals 0,  identity is conserved.<br>
