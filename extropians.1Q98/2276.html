It wouldn't matter what you did, at that distance nothing would be unscathed,  <br>
not even atoms.<br>

I think that's a big overstatement. It's true that in a vacuum you wouldn't  <br>
get hit by a shock wave caused by the pressure of matter, but you would have <br>
to worry about the enormous shock from radiation pressure. We usually think <br>
of radiation pressure as being very weak, after all, we'd need a solar sail<br>
miles across to slowly accelerate a small space ship, the feebleness is <br>
partly because the sun has a small angular size near the Earth but mostly <br>
because the of the sun is so cold, less than 10,000 degrees at the surface. <br>
When things get really hot the pressure becomes astronomical, literally <br>
astronomical, because just a small increase in temperature means a huge <br>
increase in radiation pressure, the two are related to the FOURTH power.<br>
<p>
If you heat up a tin can to temperature T the Black Body radiation pressure  <br>
inside the can is 1/3 [QT^4] , Q is the  radiation constant  <br>
7.56591* 10^-15 erg cm-3 Kelvin -4 . If you heated up the can to 90,000,000  <br>
degrees the radiation pressure inside the  can would be equal to the total <br>
pressure found at the center of the sun!   Yes your target wouldn't be <br>
completely enveloped and would only receive the radiation from one side, but <br>
on the other hand, an H bomb can produce temperatures well over 200,000,000 <br>
degrees, and the shock would be further enhanced because the outer layer of <br>
the target would vaporize and rocket outward and because momentum is <br>
conserved the inner parts would rocket inward.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, without radiation pressure an H bomb wouldn't work, the <br>
radiation from the fission trigger is the only way to compress deuterium <br>
enough to achieve fusion. You might think that photons of light couldn't <br>
evenly compress matter because of Rayleigh - Taylor instability, that's what <br>
would happen if you tried to support heavy mercury with a column of water, <br>
tiny tongs of mercury would force their way a small way into the water and <br>
then grow exponentially until the mercury had entirely fallen through the <br>
water. It's not at all obvious that the same thing wouldn't happen with light <br>
and matter, however detailed calculations by the military on the largest<br>
super computers of their day showed that this instability does not happen, <br>
photons really can compress matter evenly. This fact was kept top secret for <br>
many years, and when it was finally revealed, after painstakingly piecing it <br>
together in the early 1980's from hundreds of unclassified documents and <br>
after several people nearly went to jail, astronomers found it very <br>
interesting.<br>
<p>
The interior of the sun is at a chilly 14 million degrees so radiation <br>
pressure is not very important, the gas pressure is about 1700 times greater,  <br>
the same is true for most stars but not all, it is vitally important in  <br>
super giantstars, supernovas, the accretion cloud around Black Holes, and in <br>
the H bomb it's the entire ball game.  <br>
                <br>

<i>       &gt;What we should worry right now are not nukes nor nerve agents, but       </i><br>
<i>       &gt;engineered bioweapons (mostly viruses, not bacteriological bioweapons). </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
That does worry me, another thing that worries me are the thousands of H bombs <br>
in the former USSR guarded by angry unhappy men who drink too much and make <br>
about a thousand dollars a year.<br>
