<i>&gt;You're right.  Still, I wonder if the very things that make it seem</i><br>

<i>&gt;pain will render human claims to rights similarly trivial to a Power.  My</i><br>
<i>&gt;argument to the Power shoots for the double whammy of the appeal to hope</i><br>
<i>&gt;(unforseeable promise of pleasure) and the appeal to fear (safeguard</i><br>
<i>&gt;against unforseeable danger).  I'm afraid that an abstract appeal to</i><br>
<i>&gt;shared "rights" might start to cash out as inconsequential to real conduct</i><br>
<i>&gt;when power/knowledge-assymmetries start getting too large.  Doesn't this</i><br>
<i>&gt;happen already? </i><br>
<p>
 Abstract ideas aren't very compelling without some personal incentives<br>
to back them up. Without knowing what a power can forsee, it is hard to<br>
tell whether the incentives you've identified will work.<br>
 I don't agree that power/knowledge-assymmetries neccesarily makes shared<br>
rights unreliable. I think mutual respect for property rights is a kind<br>
of right which, once firmly established, essentially all participants have<br>
an incentive to defend the system, and adding mechanisms to discriminate<br>
between entities that want to use it would detract from the system.<br>
 Particularly in the case of digital storage space (which will almost<br>
be equivalent to life for an upload or AI), the obvious ways to respect<br>
rights involve creating a neutral set of rules that don't include any<br>
way of measuring how intelligent the actors involved are.<br>
 See &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.agorics.com/agorpapers.html">http://www.agorics.com/agorpapers.html</a>"&gt;The Agorics Papers&lt;/a&gt;<br>
for some hints about how a computational ecology could evolve under which<br>
an entity as dumb/powerless as a random number generator would interact with<br>
humans on essentially equal terms.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well, I hope to spread the vegetarian meme as part of spreading the more</i><br>
<i>&gt;general and more important "respect diversity" meme, such that a widely</i><br>
<i>&gt;disseminated respect for beings will already infect the Power before she</i><br>
<i>&gt;or he (it, they, we) *becomes* a Power in the first place.  </i><br>
<p>
 The "respect diversity" meme is one of the reasons I'm biased against<br>
vegetarianism - I want diversity in my food.<br>
 I don't see how valuing diversity implies giving plants a different<br>
status than animals. <br>
