<p>
I got interested, and did a medline search. Some abstracts included<br>

True, although you shouldn't make too much of this. Volz article<br>
(below) says that hypericum extracts are among the most widely<br>
prescribed antidepressants in Germany, and the Nordenfors article was<br>
published in the journal of the swedish medical association. It seems<br>
to me that this is more of an american problem than an international<br>
problem.<br>
<p>
Even unpatentable drugs can be sold for profit, just look at the<br>
health food stores and nutrient industry - certainly smaller than the<br>
pharmaceutical industry, but earning good money anyway. <br>

Controlled clinical trials of hypericum extracts in depressed<br>
patients--an overview.<br>
<p>
Volz HP<br>
<p>
In Germany, hypericum extracts are among the most widely prescribed<br>
antidepressants.  Additionally, many preparations of St. John's wort<br>
are sold on the free market and one extract is even the best selling<br>
antidepressant in the country. In contrast to synthetic<br>
antidepressants, the approval procedures are not so strict, which<br>
implies that the pharmaceutical industry is not forced to conduct<br>
clinical trials suitable for licensing. Nevertheless, numerous studies<br>
on hypericum extracts including depressed patients have been published<br>
in the last 20 years. The purpose of this paper is to review these<br>
investigations in respect of methodological considerations and to draw<br>
conclusions pertaining to the proof of antidepressant efficacy. To<br>
this effect, a computer-assisted literature research was performed and<br>
manufacturers were asked to supply the author with study results. A<br>
total of 12 placebo-controlled trials with hypericum extracts were<br>
performed, mostly with positive results. Also in comparison with<br>
synthetic antidepressants (3 studies published), a similar reduction<br>
of depressive symptomatology was seen, although the comparators were<br>
not adequately dosed. No trials in severely depressed patients have<br>
been published yet. Since most studies on hypericum have<br>
methodological flaws, further studies are warranted.<br>

Abstract <br>
      OBJECTIVE--To investigate if extracts of Hypericum perforatum (St<br>
      John's wort) are more effective than placebo in the treatment of<br>
      depression, are as effective as standard antidepressive treatment, and<br>
      have fewer side effects than standard antidepressant drugs.<br>
      DESIGN--Systematic review and meta-analysis of trials revealed by<br>
      searches. TRIALS--23 randomised trials including a total of 1757<br>
      outpatients with mainly mild or moderately severe depressive disorders:<br>
      15 (14 testing single preparations and one a combination with other<br>
      plant extracts) were placebo controlled, and eight (six testing single<br>
      preparations and two combinations) compared hypericum with another<br>
      drug treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--A pooled estimate of<br>
      the responder rate ratio (responder rate in treatment group/responder<br>
      rate in control group), and numbers of patients reporting and dropping<br>
      out for side effects. RESULTS--Hypericum extracts were significantly<br>
      superior to placebo (ratio = 2.67; 95% confidence interval 1.78 to 4.01)<br>
      and similarly effective as standard antidepressants (single preparations<br>
      1.10; 0.93 to 1.31, combinations 1.52; 0.78 to 2.94). There were two<br>
      (0.8%) drop outs for side effects with hypericum and seven (3.0%) with<br>
      standard antidepressant drugs. Side effects occurred in 50 (19.8%)<br>
      patients on hypericum and 84 (52.8%) patients on standard<br>
      antidepressants. CONCLUSION--There is evidence that extracts of<br>
      hypericum are more effective than placebo for the treatment of mild to<br>
      moderately severe depressive disorders. Further studies comparing<br>
      extracts with standard antidepressants in well defined groups of patients<br>
      and comparing different extracts and doses are needed. <br>

Abstract <br>
      Extracts of Hypericum perforatum St. John's wort, have been used since<br>
      antiquity for the treatment of depressive symptoms. In 25 controlled<br>
      clinical trials where hypericum extract was compared with placebo and<br>
      established antidepressants, improvement was obtained in 61 percent of<br>
      patients on low-dose treatment (&lt; 1.2 mg hypericum extract), and in 75<br>
      percent of patients treated with a higher dose (2.7 mg). The side effects<br>
      were mild and occurred at lower frequency than did those of other<br>
      antidepressants. The constituent of hypericum extract that is responsible<br>
      for the antidepressant effect has not been identified. Nor is the<br>
      mechanism of action known, but a combination of low-grade monoamine<br>
      oxidase inhibition and noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake blockade<br>
      seems the most likely alternative, though other interesting mechanisms<br>
      have also been proposed. Owing to their beneficial effect and low<br>
      toxicity, preparations containing extracts from H perforatum might furnish<br>
      an alternative to established therapy, especially among patients<br>
      concerned about stigmatization or less apprehensive of herbal<br>
      medication than of synthetic drugs. <br>

Effects of the total extract and fractions of Hypericum<br>
perforatum in animal assays for antidepressant activity.<br>
<p>
Butterweck V, Wall A, Lieflander-Wulf U, Winterhoff H, Nahrstedt A<br>
<p>
A commercially available extract of the aerial parts of Hypericum<br>
perforatum, LI 160, showed pronounced activity in selected animal<br>
bioassays. These include the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail<br>
suspension test, used to determine antidepressant activity, and tests<br>
indicating activity on the central nervous system, such as body<br>
temperature and ketamine induced sleeping time. The counteracting<br>
effects of drugs known to interfere with the central dopaminergic<br>
system strongly suggested that dopamine mediated activity is important<br>
for the activity of the extract.  Dose-response experiments of the<br>
total extract and of fractions rich in flavonoids and<br>
napthodianthrones produced inverted U-shaped dose response curves.<br>

Effects of long-term administration of hypericum extracts on<br>
the affinity and density of the central serotonergic 5-HT1 A and<br>
5-HT2 A receptors.<br>
<p>
Teufel-Mayer R, Gleitz J<br>
<p>
Extracts of St. John's wort, Hypericum perforatum L. (Hypericaceae),<br>
are used as a phytotherapeutic antidepressant. A number of clinical<br>
studies demonstrate that their antidepressive potency is comparable to<br>
tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). Although the therapeutic effect of<br>
hypericum extracts is well documented, very little is known about the<br>
molecular mode of action. As the improvement of the depressive<br>
symptoms with both TCA and hypericum extracts only occurs<br>
significantly after a lag phase of 10 to 14 days, it is assumed that<br>
the medication causes long-term adaptations within the central nervous<br>
system. In this context, serotonergic (5-HT) receptors are of special<br>
interest. Therefore, we investigated possible alterations in affinity<br>
and density of 5-HT1 A and 5-HT2 A receptors caused by long-term<br>
treatment of rats with St.  John's wort. The brain without cerebellum<br>
and brain stem of rats, treated daily for 26 weeks with a commercially<br>
available hypericum extract (2700 mg/kg LI 160) were used for membrane<br>
preparations. Affinity (KD) and amount (Bmax) of serotonergic<br>
receptors were determined by employing receptor binding assays using 3<br>
H-8-OH-DPAT and 3H-Ketanserin as selective radioligands for the 5-HT1<br>
A and the 5-HT2 A receptors, respectively. We found that in<br>
hypericum-treated rats the number of both 5-HT1 A and 5-HT2 A<br>
receptors were significantly increased by 50% compared to controls,<br>
whereas the affinity of both serotonergic receptors remained<br>
unaltered. The data suggest an upregulation of 5-HT1 A and 5-HT2 A<br>
receptors due to prolonged administration of hypericum extracts. These<br>
results are consistent with a modification of the expression levels of<br>
serotonergic receptors caused by synthetic antidepressants.<br>

Placebo-controlled double-blind study examining the<br>
effectiveness of an hypericum preparation in 105 mildly<br>
depressed patients.<br>
<p>
Sommer H, Harrer G<br>
<p>
One hundred and five outpatients with mild depressions of short<br>
duration were treated in a double-blind study with either 3 x 300 mg<br>
hypericum extract or placebo. The therapy phase was 4 weeks. The<br>
effectiveness was judged according to the Hamilton Depression Scale<br>
after 2 and 4 weeks. The values of the mean basic score in these<br>
periods fell from 15.8 to 9.6 or 7.2 in the active group, and in the<br>
placebo group, from 15.8 to 12.3 and 11.3. The differences between<br>
active and placebo groups were statistically significant with P &lt; .05<br>
and P &lt; .01 achieved after 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. In the active<br>
group, 28 of 42 patients (67%) and, in the placebo group, 13 of 47<br>
patients (28%) responded to treatment. Notable side effects were not<br>
found.<br>
