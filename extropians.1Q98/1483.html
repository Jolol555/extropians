<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;For example, Omni magazine had a reasonably well promoted contest</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;with Alcor.  This was a big jump into the mainstream, especially</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;perversion.  However it was not much of a success; there weren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;many entries, and I think most people were just not ready for it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if WIRED were to try the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thing today?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Good question.  My gut says the same thing would happen - cryonics</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not much more popular today than it was a few years ago during the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Omni contest.</i><br>
<p>
I think that people view cryonic suspension with the same dread they view any<br>
sort of preparation for death, which is why not many people have prepared<br>
themselves beforehand with a contract with a funeral home, nor do most people<br>
get wills prepared, at least until they are old. What needs to be done is to<br>
lobby within the insurance and death industries to offer this as another<br>
service. If institutions as conservative and stodgy as insurance companies and<br>
funeral homes make this a common option, it will gain popularity, much like<br>
cremation has gained popularity in recent years as it became more available<br>
and became the affordable option.<br>
<p>
If you want to go the sales hype route, you need to sell the concept of<br>
cryonics as time travel.<br>
