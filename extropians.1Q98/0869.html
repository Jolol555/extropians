Many people think of Microsoft as a "huge exoself" of Bill Gates...<br>
If so, is the guy (by fuzzy definition) already a transhuman, while<br>
we are still merely transhumanists? I do not have any special<br>

flew to mind after reading about ten "Microsoft is the Borg" articles<br>
followed by this message. Hmm...<br>
