<i>&gt; &gt; what we need are tools to help</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; those programmers be much more productive with their time.  Also, tools</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; like these will likely get rid of much of the more boring aspects of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; computer programming, which are boring because they require very little</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thought and could be better done by a computer.</i><br>
<p>
That's exactly what people have been saying for the last 18 years<br>
I've been programming, and bits and pieces of it have been accomplished:<br>
first it was Fortran, then "structured" programming languages like<br>
Algol, then "Object-oriented" programming; next will probably be Agoric<br>
programming.<br>
<p>
All of these things helped, and more will help, but don't delude<br>
yourself into imagining that programming will ever be an easy job.<br>
No matter how high-level and automated the tools get, the products<br>
produced by those tools plus human hard work  and ingenuity will<br>
always be superior to those produced by tools and simple operators.<br>
And users will demand the superior products.<br>
<p>
Programming is, at the root, the art of accurately and completely<br>
communicating a problem to machine that can solve the problem<br>
faster than you can.  It cannot, then, ever be simpler in concept<br>
than the problem itself, and the more computer power you have,<br>
the more complex problems you can solve, and the more difficult<br>
it will be to communicate them accurately and completely, trendy<br>
tools and languages notwithstanding.<br>
