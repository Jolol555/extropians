I recently discovered Pathfinder (<a href="http://www.pathfinder.com/">http://www.pathfinder.com/</a>) an online <br>
forum where all varieties of current events are discussed. I haven't had <br>
so much fun discussing extropian ideas before.  I'm surprised how many <br>
people are hip to the idea when it is presented in a rational manner.<br>
<p>
I recentlly started a thread on indefinite life extension, asking people <br>
if they are ready to live indefinitly:<br>

<p>
I can see the reality in this concept and I do think it is possible. My <br>
question is do you think this planet will be able to substain life <br>
another 250 years if we continue to distroy it at the rate we are <br>
progressing ?<br>

<p>
Dbetz: Yes, if we continue to use the same technologies and processes <br>
that we now have for another 250 years, the entire ecosystem could <br>
destabilize and humanity along with many other species could be wiped <br>
off the planet like a bad case of the flu. That's why it is essential <br>
that along with increased lifespan, comes increased responsibility to <br>
improve ourselves. Obviously anyone with increased intelligence can see <br>
that our current inefficient and polluting ways are a dead end. <br>
Long-term survival implies that wedevelop a sustainable society both on <br>
earth and off.<br>

ON CLONING:<br>

Are you against President Clinton's proposed five-year ban on human <br>
cloning then? Does he have a point that "scientific advancement does not <br>
occur in a moral vacuum" or is this just hot air from a politician who <br>
doesn't want to rock the boat? Is it worth taking a timeout before we <br>
run the risk , according to one fertility expert,of producing babies <br>
whose chromosomes match those of the donor -- i.e., by the time they <br>
reach 20, they could have the blood pressure problems of their <br>
middle-aged parents?<br>
<p>

<p>
In principle, I am not against a kind of moratorium to allow time to <br>
develope a wise and beniificial plan on how it can be used productively. <br>
However, Clinton is merely pandering to popular (i.e ignorant and <br>
fearful) opinion in order to protect his butt and that of his party. His <br>
rhetoric was full of moral and religious overtones that are irrelevelant <br>
to conducting safe and sound science. Most people when asked why they <br>
are against cloning, resort to such stupid answers as "its wrong, <br>
immoral and dangerous" w/o giving a single reason why, other than "it <br>
just is!". <br>
<p>
We don't need a ban, we need an informed and educated debate and how <br>
best to DEVELOPE this technology, not how to stop it.<br>

On the hysteria about asteroid imacts and why space migration is good <br>
thing:<br>
<p>
[phughes] - 04:04am Jan 10, 1998 EST (#35 of 37) <br>
<p>
 I have two points to make about asteroid impacts. <br>
<p>
1) The chance of an asteroid hitting earth with enough force to <br>
seriously destabilize human civiliation within the next 100 years is <br>
about 1 in 50,000. I take those odds every time I get in my car. I'm not <br>
worried. <br>
<p>
2) If you are worried, which you should be if you care about the <br>
long-term survival of the human race, then you should also be a strong <br>
advocate for space migration. It is utterly silly that we should <br>
contemplate a long and sustainable future, without incorporating space <br>
migration as THE FUTURE for humankind. We have an amazing, beautiful and <br>
infinite universe awaiting us, if we can just muster the courage and the <br>
will to go. We must - otherwise all life's 3.875 billion year struggle <br>
from primeavel hot baths to now would have been in vane. The universe is <br>
calling us. It is our birthright and our future. <br>
<p>
Ad Astra!<br>
