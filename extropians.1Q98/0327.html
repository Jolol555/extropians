Honestly, I intended to lurk for a while before butting in on other people's<br>
discussions...  but...  :-)<br>

<p>
That could be applied to all social interaction.  If you attack me, you do so<br>
under the threat that I may defend myself; even if you only insult me, you do so<br>
under the threat that I may react violently.  Government is no worse inherently<br>
than people.  I don't disagree with your view of government, but it is a very<br>
cynical view, and loses validity if you don't apply as rigorous a cynicism to<br>
your own dealings with others.<br>

<p>
Excuse me.  Campaign finance reform in many countries outside the US has<br>
resulted in a broader field of candidates and increased voter participation.  It<br>
is done by the state financing or mandating free party political broadcasts and<br>
advertising, and by severely restricting both donations and the uses to which<br>
donations can be put.<br>
<p>
(But these are only small points in your discussion, Anton.)<br>
