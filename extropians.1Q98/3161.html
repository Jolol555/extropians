The jury is supposed to find a person guilty of a criminal offense only<br>
if the evidence proves him guilty "beyond a reasonable doubt." Of course<br>
the jury cannot be held responsible for not considering the unknown.<br>
However, if evidence surfaces after the trial that exonerates the<br>
defendant, I think it's fair to say that the jury made a mistake in<br>
concluding that the evidence presented at the trial proved the<br>
defendant’s guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt." Now if witnesses lied at<br>
the trial or if false evidence was presented, that is another story. In<br>
any case, juries ought to be more careful about sending people off to<br>
prison or to the executioner.<br>
