The article mentions the average French diet consisting of large amounts of<br>
saturated fat.  Despite this diet the French still enjoy relatively long<br>
lifespans when compared to other regions that have comparable diets.  For<br>
example, the average lifespan in the southeastern United States, where the<br>
average diet is high in saturated fat, is lower than that of the French.<br>
<p>
Then again, it was a French scientist that did the study.  Maybe its a<br>
clandestine plot to boost the wine market. :)<br>
