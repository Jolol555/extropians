No-one knows. It might be the end of civilization as we know it, or it<br>
might just mean that your VCR records the wrong program. A more likely<br>
scenario is that lots of computers will go wrong in the next couple of<br>
years and a fair number of governments and corporations will never <br>
recover.<br>

<p>
Most PCs will work, most web access should be fine (there are some<br>
problems with web-servers that use two-digit dates) and AFAIK all<br>
SMTP email uses four-digit dates. That assumes, of course, we still<br>
have power and phone lines.<br>

<p>
I've been wondering that myself, but with so much uncertainty as to<br>
what will happen, it's hard to say... other than that the people who<br>
get it right probably will make a lot of profit.<br>
