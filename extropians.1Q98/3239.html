<i>&gt; From:          Harvey Newstrom &lt;harv@gate.net&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Have you ever been in a bank when the computer was down?  I have.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; absolutely refused to give me my money.  Legal threats were of no use.</i><br>
<p>
Different banks, different attitudes.  I was in that situation once; <br>
service was slow, but it happened.  And I got some money, no problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They really have no mechanism to issue cash or record transactions without</i><br>
<i>&gt; the computer.  Even if they did have a method, they would probably be too</i><br>
<i>&gt; scared to use it.</i><br>
<p>
They filled out the same paperwork that they always fill out.  The <br>
only delay was looking up account info in the most recent <br>
printed lists (which that bank get twice a week) for withdrawals.<br>
<p>

US$500 fee for receipt of unsolicited commercial email. USC 47.5.II.227<br>
