I think it was something similar to this technique which was used by JPL<br>
to get some Mars Pathfinder pictures in "super resolution".  They took<br>
multiple pictures at slightly different angles and combined them digitally<br>
to produce higher resolution than the camera was capable of.<br>
<p>
The human eye is constantly jiggling.  If you manage to stare at an<br>
object without moving your eyes, it disappears.  Using artificial means<br>
to stabilize an image on the retina, it quickly fades to invisibility.<br>
So it is conceivable that the eye could produce higher resolution images<br>
than the spacing of its photoreceptors would imply.<br>
