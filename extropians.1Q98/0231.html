      Popperians never waste time arguing about the meaning of words or <br>
      their 'essential' content, because words have no 'essential <br>
      content.'  Definitions work 'from right to left.'<br>
<p>
      'Law' has always been confused as between 'law' (the 'horizontalist' <br>
      system of rules of interpersonal conduct); and 'legislation' (the <br>
      'verticalist' edicts of (state) power, wheby some people assert <br>
      control over some other people). Naturally, the powerful would like <br>
      you to accept their edicts as having the same moral force as mutual <br>
      interpersonal rules.<br>
<p>
      Most verticalist systems stress 'punishment' or 'retribution' or <br>
      'retaliation' or 'correction.'  The general idea is "Do this or <br>
      we'll hurt you.' That is, they're _control systems_.<br>
<p>
      Whereas horizontalist systems stress prevention and restitution. <br>
<p>
      Look at the Saxon model of indemnity in England: travellers outside <br>
      their own community carried certificates of indemnification from <br>
      their fellow-villagers, so that if they did harm, full compensation <br>
      could be promptly and reliably made.  This made them more <br>
      acceptable visitors to other communities.<br>
<p>
<p>
      Whereas the (typical) Norman State system says: "This is the book of <br>
      edicts. Do what it tells you or you'll be punished with x, y or z."<br>
<p>
                      ----------- * * * * * -----------<br>

      Here's a proposed alternative paradigm:<br>
<p>
      A key Agorist insight is that we should focus on the nature of acts <br>
      themselves, rather than on the status or funding of individuals.  <br>
      When rights are not infringed, there is no crime.<br>
<p>
      So:<br>
<p>
      Let everyone carry full public-liability insurance, issued by <br>
      comopeting private insurers and reinsured for complete reliability.  <br>
<p>
      Let there be a 'pooled' arrangement whereby there are funds <br>
      available where the harmful person cannot be found.  Then full and <br>
      fair compensation can be provided for any harm done.<br>
<p>
      Let each person carry a personalized radio emergency alarm, to <br>
      summon the protectiion service of their choice immediately to their <br>
      exact location.  This vastly reduces the incidence of -- and the <br>
      costs of -- crime.<br>
<p>
      Then, all 'law' becomes event-driven and customer-driven,  Full and <br>
      prompt compensation is _always_ paid to victims of personal harm or <br>
      property loss.  Restrictions may be endorsed on the policies of <br>
      policy-holders, by their insurers, to limit future pay-outs for harm <br>
      done.   People get the message from their earliest days, that <br>
      harming people is a no-no.  in all but a few examples of extreme <br>
      violence, the ultimate sanction is house arrest or confinement to a <br>
      suitable 'outlaw area."<br>
<p>
<p>
      The system doesn't even need a State.  Owners/controllers of public <br>
      and private places can make carrying such insurances a condition of <br>
      entry.  The system can be substantially self-organizing.<br>
<p>
      Cosmos rather than Taxis, in Hayek's terminology.<br>
