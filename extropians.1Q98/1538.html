The following is from the American Enterprise Institute. www.aei.org. This article <br>
refutes the doom and gloomers who continue to insist that most of us are becoming worse <br>
off. It ain't so. We continue to become better off economically despite the monstrous <br>
parasite of a government we have. (Oh, to have that burden lifted!)<br>
<p>
<p>
Here's the article:<br>
<p>
Living Standards in the United States<br>
<p>
The ninth seminar in AEI's series Understanding Economic Inequality was led by Daniel <br>
T. Slesnick of the<br>
University of Texas at Austin. Mr. Slesnick argued that consumption is a more relevant <br>
measure than income for<br>
gauging economic inequality, and he showed that consumption data suggest little change <br>
in inequality over the past<br>
twenty-five years. A summary of his presentation follows.<br>
<p>
Economic inequality and its growth are almost always measured in terms of income. In <br>
recent years, considerable<br>
publicity has been given to studies indicating that since the early 1970s median family <br>
income has been stagnant,<br>
inequality has been increasing, and the poverty rate has stopped declining. But <br>
material well-being is actually a<br>
function of consumption, not of income. Assuming consumption could be measured <br>
properly, what would it show<br>
about trends in standards of living in the United States over the past quarter-century <br>
and trends in the gap between<br>
rich and poor?<br>
<p>
Research into these questions yields striking results. Measures of consumption show <br>
that--contrary to what is<br>
generally believed--living standards for rich and poor alike have continued to rise <br>
since 1970 and that the disparity<br>
between rich and poor has increased very little.<br>
<p>
Measuring trends in inequality is difficult for many reasons, and those difficulties <br>
have an important bearing on the<br>
controversy over inequality, as other scholars in this series have shown. Measurement <br>
problems are particularly<br>
significant in the case of income, but they affect analysis of consumption as well. <br>
Consider the following issues:<br>
<p>
  How should housing be treated? A homeowner whose mortgage is paid off enjoys the use <br>
of his house but<br>
makes no cash outlay for that use. He consumes but does not spend. The same problem <br>
arises on a smaller scale<br>
for other consumer durables, such as automobiles.<br>
<p>
  What price index should one use to measure consumption in real (that is, <br>
inflation-adjusted) terms? There are<br>
problems with the consumer price index, including the widely acknowledged flaws in its <br>
treatment of housing<br>
before 1983, which exaggerated inflation.<br>
<p>
  How does one adjust for family size? Does a family of ten require exactly five times <br>
the consumption of a family<br>
of two? Clearly not, but what is the right adjustment for "equivalence"? What about the <br>
households not composed<br>
of families?<br>
<p>
After accounting for these and other measurement problems, I have developed measures of <br>
economic well-being<br>
based on data on personal consumption expenditures in the national income accounts.<br>
<p>
Real median family income, the traditional measure of economic well-being, increased by <br>
an average of 2.7 percent<br>
per year from 1947 to 1970 but stopped rising after 1970. Real per capita consumption, <br>
however, kept on<br>
growing. It rose by 2.4 percent per year from 1947 to 1970 and by only a little <br>
less--2.1 percent--from 1970 to<br>
1993.<br>
<p>
What accounts for the divergence in these trends? Part of the explanation lies in <br>
changes in family size. If a family<br>
of four and a family of three have the same income, the standard of living--the per <br>
capita availability of income for<br>
consumption--of the family of three is obviously higher. This would not matter if <br>
average family size were stable,<br>
but in fact it has been declining over the past quarter-century. In addition, measuring <br>
changes in real median family<br>
income ignores the nearly one-third of the population composed of "unrelated <br>
individuals," that is, persons not<br>
living with family.<br>
<p>
Another part of the answer lies in the aforementioned flaws in the consumer price <br>
index, which exaggerated<br>
inflation before 1983 and, as a result, decreased measures of real income. The deflator <br>
for personal consumption<br>
expenditures in the national income accounts, which is used to eliminate inflation from <br>
measures of consumption,<br>
does not have this problem.<br>
<p>
The argument that standards of living have been rising since 1970 finds further support <br>
in Engel's law, which with<br>
plentiful historical evidence posits an inverse relationship between one's standard of <br>
living and the share of total<br>
spending one devotes to food. Reported decreases in the proportion of total expenses <br>
households devote to food<br>
therefore support the view that standards of living have continued to rise in the past <br>
quarter-century.<br>
<p>
Measures of inequality based on the survey of consumer expenditures also show a quite <br>
different trend from those<br>
based on income. According to the latter, inequality has increased strikingly. For <br>
example, the ratio of income in<br>
the top three deciles to income in the bottom three rose from 5.4 in 1961 to 7.9 in <br>
1992. But when consumption is<br>
substituted for income as the basis for measuring inequality, the ratio scarcely <br>
changes--it was 3.9 in 1961 and 4.0<br>
in 1992.<br>
<p>
Incomes fluctuate more than consumption does from one year to the next. People do not <br>
decrease their spending<br>
significantly when they regard a loss of income as temporary. Material welfare is best <br>
measured, where possible,<br>
by lifetime or "permanent" income. Since consumption is a more accurate proxy for <br>
permanent income than annual<br>
income is, this is still another reason to prefer consumption to income as a measure of <br>
material welfare.<br>
<p>
These varied approaches to the problem of assessing economic inequality all point to <br>
the conclusion that both the<br>
level of economic well-being in America and its distribution have performed far better <br>
during the past<br>
quarter-century if consumption rather than family income measures are used. Moreover, <br>
on several counts<br>
consumption is a more appropriate measure of economic well-being than income.<br>
