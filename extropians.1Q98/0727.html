<i>|from the patriarchal to the statist to the market conspiracy).</i><br>
<p>
  One can say the same about "government benevolence" theories.<br>
Those are by far the more popular...Bill and Hilary "care" about us,<br>
"the government is us", etc etc ad nauseum.  Regulatory agency are<br>
put in place to "help" us....<br>
<p>
<i>||To me this is a sign of sloppy thinking. Sure, there are dirty</i><br>

<p>
  Does so!  Unless you are a strict materialist reductionist...in<br>
which case purposeful human action is a delusion.<br>
<p>
 A conspiracy theory usually<br>
<i>|works by showing some suggestive but weak evidence, and then</i><br>
<i>|explaining away the lack of confirmation by cover-up. It is</i><br>
<i>|unfalsifiable ("Of course there are no witnessess, they have all been</i><br>
<i>|scared into silence"), defends itself vigorously from criticism ("See?</i><br>
<i>|They have indoctrinated you too!") and promotes spread (in order to</i><br>
<i>|help others see the truth). In short, they make very efficient memes,</i><br>
<i>|but they do not have to be true to spread well.</i><br>
<p>
  This is bigotted stereotyping above.  Just as in any other field of<br>
inquiry, some theories are better supported by evidence than others.<br>
In the case of the Ron Brown  there are now 4 whistle blowers<br>
who have come forward!  The reality of cover-up is now well supported by<br>
evidence<br>
but still, people supposedly interested in liberty and opposing govt<br>
tyranny "aren't interested"!  Looks to me that irrational "pro-govt" memes<br>
are much more powerful than "conspiracy memes"....too bad!<br>
<p>
<i>|Keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out.</i><br>
<p>
  Sanders, you give no indication what-so-ever that you are considering<br>
_any_ specific evidence regarding any particular conspiracy theory.  Methinks<br>
many, but not all Extropians, fear to see and therefore reject, the evidence<br>
that their hopes for the future will be dashed unless the conspiracy that is<br>
government can be defeated.....pointing-out the chronic on-going conspiracies<br>
within and around government are an important tool in building a better<br>
future with little or no government.<br>
<p>
  The govt's reaction to cloning is just a hint of how anti-extropian it is and<br>
will continue to be unless a popular anti-govt memetic field can be erected.<br>
