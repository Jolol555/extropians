From: Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One of the big problems in any 21st century SF which incorporates</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotech and similar advances is how to avoid the Singularity -</i><br>
<i>&gt;the acceleration of advancement into a pace so furious that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world becomes unrecognizable. It appears that Halperin has no more</i><br>
<i>&gt;than postponed the Singularity, as it looks unlikely to me that</i><br>
<i>&gt;humanity will come out of his 22nd century in any kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;recognizable form.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
True, the "Singularity" as you define it did not appear, but I<br>
think that there is a certain amount of subjectivity to it's<br>
definition. The rate of progress as portrayed in the book would<br>
floor the average American, and completely overwhelm the average<br>
third-worlder. I know I was reeling at some of the possibilities.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Halperin has a couple of tricks to slow the rate of technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;advance. One is to put restrictions on AI research.  Some early AI</i><br>
<i>&gt;machines become aggressive and kill people, and after that they</i><br>
<i>&gt;are not supposed to be programmed with emotions or survival</i><br>
<i>&gt;instincts.  They're just a bunch of Vulcan types.  They do become</i><br>
<i>&gt;much smarter than humans over the course of the 21st century, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;presumably these restrictions do limit their rate of advance.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think this was more than a mere trick to avoid the singularity,<br>
The author, seems to be against certain advances:<br>
<p>
"We could implant intelligent machines in physical bodies like<br>
ours, or some other higher life-forms. Hell, before you know it,<br>
we'll be advanced enough to create a wholw new species superior to<br>
ourselves. Sure we could do that, but why would we? Then we'd have<br>
created a hyperintelligent competitive species. Such an act would<br>
be insane: would have a wholly unpredictable outcome. It would be<br>
as mad as a full-scale nuclear exchange in the 1980's so I don't<br>
expect it, even in light of todays crisis." (page 303)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The other magic which Halperin has up his sleeve is his Truth</i><br>
<i>&gt;Machine. This was the subject of his first novel, which I haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt;read.  The device is a foolproof lie detector, and it allows laws</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be enforced with a certainty far beyond anything which would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;reasonable today.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, I've ordered, but not yet received his first book, the truth<br>
machine made for a very interesting story element.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Once there is a world government armed with the truth machine,</i><br>
<i>&gt;they can pass laws restricting access to nanotech (and presumably</i><br>
<i>&gt;any other destabilizing technologies) and be sure they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;enforced.  This prevents various technology runaway scenarios,</i><br>
<i>&gt;both good and bad.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not having read the first novel, I find the potential for abuse</i><br>
<i>&gt;with a truth machine very troubling.  It is presented in almost</i><br>
<i>&gt;purely beneficial terms, but obviously it could be misused as</i><br>
<i>&gt;well.  The idea reminds me somewhat of David Brin's "transparent</i><br>
<i>&gt;society", where you have a Big Brother-like monitoring system, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's OK because the people doing the monitoring get monitored,</i><br>
<i>&gt;too.  The danger is that if an evil person somehow got into power,</i><br>
<i>&gt;he'd be able to use these technologies to maintain his power very</i><br>
<i>&gt;effectivelly.  No revolt or rebellion could be hidden.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In effect this kind of technology is a power amplifier.  Whoever</i><br>
<i>&gt;has the bulk of power in society can use this to enforce their</i><br>
<i>&gt;will.  If the mass of people ultimately has the power, then in</i><br>
<i>&gt;many ways the truth machine will be beneficial, as they can</i><br>
<i>&gt;prevent evil people from seizing power away from them.  On the</i><br>
<i>&gt;other hand, where the masses misuse their power, there won't be</i><br>
<i>&gt;the limitations on their abilities that we have today. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;majority of people in the United States believes in conventional</i><br>
<i>&gt;religious morality, but if it wants to legislate on that basis, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;practice it can't control people's private lives very well.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt;truth machine would change that.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Good points all, I have serious doubts about the idea of a "world<br>
government". They mostly revolve around "redistribution" (wealth,<br>
poer, etc) scenarios. Control junkies are dangerous.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I see it is in development as an upcoming mini-series, if done</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; properly, IMMHO it could change the future of cryonics.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm a little skeptical about this, having seen many efforts fail</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the past which were going to change the future of cryonics. </i><br>
<i>&gt;For example, Omni magazine had a reasonably well promoted contest</i><br>
<i>&gt;where the prize was "immortality" - a cryonic suspension contract</i><br>
<i>&gt;with Alcor.  This was a big jump into the mainstream, especially</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the idea of cryonics as a prize, a reward, not some kooky</i><br>
<i>&gt;perversion.  However it was not much of a success; there weren't</i><br>
<i>&gt;many entries, and I think most people were just not ready for it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if WIRED were to try the same<br>
thing today?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I thought Halperin's novel was most effective in depicting a 21st</i><br>
<i>&gt;century where we'd like to live, and where technology really does</i><br>
<i>&gt;advance to the point where it solves many of our most difficult</i><br>
<i>&gt;problems.  I was uncomfortable when it took on a scolding tone,</i><br>
<i>&gt;shaking its head over how blind people were in the late 20th</i><br>
<i>&gt;century not to sign up for cryonics. This reminds me too much of</i><br>
<i>&gt;a temperance tract regaling us with the evils of Demon Alcohol.</i><br>
<p>
I didn't see this as a scolding, it made me a little sad, and more<br>
determined than ever to sign up. In my own case this novel<br>
solidified my reasoning on the issue.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Science fiction authors often succumb to the temptation to have</i><br>
<i>&gt;their future characters talk about the mistakes of the 20th</i><br>
<i>&gt;century - if only they'd taken care of the environment, or if only</i><br>
<i>&gt;they'd been more socialist, no, if only they'd been more</i><br>
<i>&gt;capitalist, etc.  I never find this realistic (how much time do we</i><br>
<i>&gt;spend talking about the mistakes of the 1890's?), and even when it</i><br>
<i>&gt;does fit, I don't necessarily think the future characters are</i><br>
<i>&gt;right (people today disagree over the morality of the "robber</i><br>
<i>&gt;barons" of the 19th century, even with 100 years of hindsight).</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Halperin doesn't overdo this, fortunately.  If his novel is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;success then it probably will help to make cryonics more</i><br>
<i>&gt;acceptable.  But I suspect that it will be many years before it</i><br>
<i>&gt;becomes truly mainstream.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, vision in the "retrospectroscope" is always 20/20, but I<br>
thought he accomplished this quite well. In a world where cryonics<br>
has proven to work, those who didn't see the possibility will be<br>
seen as lacking vision.<br>
<p>
I think when this is widebanded as a T.V. miniseries, this could<br>
have a big effect.<br>
