<p>
Could be, but then again the next generation Truster would probably have <br>
something to compensate for this, which of course would result in even better <br>
countermeasures etc, ad infinitum. For the time being at least you'll have an<br>
edge over more than 99% of the people on the phone.<br>
<p>
Besides, the system doesn't have to be used (only) over the phone; it can also<br>
be used to test someone face-tot-face. Put the CD-ROM in your laptop and you <br>
have a portable lie detector. Very useful for business deals and to check the <br>
honesty of friends, lovers, family members, folks on the radio &amp; TV etc, and <br>
great fun at parties ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Btw, I don't see what's so funny about it ...</i><br>
<p>
Use your imagination, man! The sky is the limit ;-)<br>
How about a _real_ game of "truth or dare", for example...<br>
And if not funny, then at least very useful. The mere presence<br>
of a lie detector often makes people confess. Btw, small<br>
cameras &amp; microphones in your house, (possibly linked to motion <br>
detectors) and on/in your clothing can be extremely useful too in<br>
the fight against all kinds of injustice. Empowerment trough <br>
technology, very transhuman indeed.<br>
<p>
P.s: no, I'm not a salesman ;-)<br>
