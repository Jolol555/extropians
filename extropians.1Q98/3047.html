<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; As I've shown many times, the definition of identity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; "A=A" is the crackpot fallacy of Circular Definition:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If a definition is fallacious for including a paraphrase of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the word defined, then *all* definitions are fallacious. And </i><br>
<i>&gt;yet they're still useful.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: A definition is useful IF it puts <br>
  the defined in context, IF it defines <br>
  the relations of the defined to things <br>
  that are different than it. The "A=A" <br>
  definition of A does not do that, it <br>
  seeks to remove A from context, and thus <br>
  seeks to nullify its identity to the ex-<br>
  tent its identity is derived from differ-<br>
  ential relation, which it is by 100%.<br>
<p>
<p>
  We can go around and around about identity,<br>
  but the shortcut is to simply show me the <br>
  proof, show me A that is A free from not-A.<br>
  That's all you need to do. You don't need<br>
  to call me names or get mad, just prove it.<br>
  I've tired to and having failed to do so, <br>
  accepted that the identity of A is not the <br>
  "same as" A, but rather, A is the difference <br>
  between A and not-A, and I didn't get upset.<br>
<p>
  You've tried to do that, and like my own <br>
  effort, your examples of "free identities" <br>
  have only evidenced examples of holistic <br>
  identities. If you cannot find any example<br>
  of any identity or any attribute of any <br>
  identity that is not derived from differ-<br>
  ential relation but from "same-as relation,"<br>
  then you must admit that the "same-as"<br>
  definition of identity is false, irra-<br>
  tional, and thus definitionally crackpot.<br>
<p>
  A is A not because A is the same as A,<br>
  A is A because A is different than not-A.<br>
<p>
  We've been through this in the past, you<br>
  never found a single example to support the <br>
  atomist-identity theory you believe then and <br>
  you still cannot find even one example now<br>
  and yet here you are still clinging to it.<br>
  How is it that some people can believe in <br>
  that for which there is 100% no evidence? <br>
<p>
