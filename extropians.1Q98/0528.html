<p>
Which hypothesis is simpler, that the parameters of this universe are<br>
random, or that they was chosen by an intelligent being? I think this<br>
question can be formalized as "what is the shortest program that outputs<br>
the parameters of this universe?"<br>
<p>
Of course there are many such programs, but let's just consider two<br>
categories corresponding to the two hypotheses. A program of the first<br>
kind consists of the parameters stored as constants and a single Print<br>
statement that outputs them. A program of the second kind involves the<br>
evolution of an intelligent being which then does various computation to<br>
figure out the optimal parameters for a universe to have our kind of life. <br>
<p>
If the shortest program is of the first kind, it would mean that the<br>
parameters of this universe are essentially random and have no simpler<br>
explanation. If the shortest program is of the second kind, then the<br>
simplest explanation for the parameters being what they are is that they<br>
were chosen by an intelligent being.<br>
