<i>&gt;Mars is closer than the Moon in terms of the energy required</i><br>
<i>&gt;to get there.  From LEO to the Moon, the delta-V is 6.0km/s whereas</i><br>
<i>&gt;to get to Mars it's only 4.5 km/s!  The trans-mars injection is only</i><br>
<i>&gt;a little more expensive than the Moon but the huge savings comes from</i><br>
<i>&gt;the fact that Mars has an atmosphere you can use to slow down.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;Moon requires you to haul a bunch of fuel with which to stop yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt;once you're there.</i><br>
<p>
But don't forget the delta V required to get back off of mars.  From the moon,<br>
products such including metals, H2, and O2 can be launched into trans-earth<br>
trajectories using just about anything - mechanical slinger, light gas gun,<br>
mass driver, etc.  Also, the moon is a fine place for a beanstalk or skyhook,<br>
requiring much less of a taper ratio or strength in the cable than on Mars or<br>
Earth.<br>
<p>
Obviously it depends on where you want to build.  If you prefer being stuck at<br>
the bottom of a gravity well, Mars is a good one.  If you want to build a<br>
self-supporting colony in the near term (pre advanced nanotech), don't you<br>
think it's good to be within the earth-moon system, and to trade products more<br>
quickly with less impulse?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;still (at the time of writing) over-estimated costs.  A 100% private</i><br>
<i>&gt;venture run by seat-of-the-pants entreprenuers and pioneers could bring</i><br>
<i>&gt;costs down even more.</i><br>
I spent years working for a private space venture that spent $20-30 million,<br>
but have become very skeptical of the likelihood of massive private space<br>
investment as of yet.  Where massive profits have already been made, the<br>
investors come out of hiding.  Until then, the barrier is too high to jump. <br>
$1000/Lb to LEO will help.<br>
