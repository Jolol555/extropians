Dr. O'Neil was one my heroes as well, and sadly he was not preserved. <br>
Niether were Gene Roddenberry or Timothy Leary (biggest surprise of <br>

<p>
There was some discussion on this list awhile back  about why people who <br>
promoted extropian ideas including  immortality, succumbed to entropy in <br>
the end.<br>
