Hmm.  Close but not quite.  I'd venture that any of the more <br>
serious thinkers on this list have, at some point, misunderstood<br>
a generally-accepted theory and thus "found" a fatal flaw.  The<br>
only ways to avoid that are a) don't think about generally-accepted<br>
theory or b) never make mistakes.<br>
<p>
The difference between a crackpot and a non-crackpot making an <br>
error is that the non-crackpot realizes the #1 reason for the<br>
"fatal flaw" is that they've misunderstood the theory.  A non-<br>
crackpot checks the literature and talks to people knowledgeable<br>
about the theory, trying to see if this has already been addressed<br>
somehow.  A crackpot goes straight to the public.<br>
<p>
When I was a teen, I figured out a paradox involving colliding<br>
time bombs which I thought invalidated special relativity.  I <br>
never made a big deal of it.  A few years back, I figured out<br>
why my idea *doesn't* work - and I tell you, it left me very <br>
impressed with both relativity and Einstein.<br>
