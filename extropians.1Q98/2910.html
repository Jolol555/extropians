<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know, what did (do?) they target in the USSR, Eastern europe and</i><br>

<p>
Since the  Soviet missiles were taken out, there is very little left to target<br>
that is of military value. They have a total of 8 Mig-29 fighters left, some<br>
coastal patrol boats, and a few deisel submarines that are in dock and short<br>
of parts. At this point, Cuba is purposely starving itself merely from latin<br>
pride, trying to make a last point, and doing it badly. While dollars rule the<br>
economy, even legally, the gov'ts 100+% tax policies have forced any<br>
meaningful economy underground, just as in many parts of the old Soviet Union.<br>
<p>
Cuba is so desperate for international PR points that they manufactured an<br>
agricultural blight to try to accuse the US of 'biological warfare'.<br>
<p>
Its good to see that the Pope still has enough kick to tell Castro he's full<br>
of it in public. He's probably the last western person the Cuban people will<br>
beleive other than el Commadante.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and how would they explain the fallout to the powerful independant</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; territory of the Conk (Florida Keys) or Jamaica, Caymans, etc.?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that the US has shown enough times that they don't give a fuck</i><br>
<i>&gt; about what a bunch of centroamericans think.  What would they have said to</i><br>
<i>&gt; western europe had they bombed the east?</i><br>
<i>&gt; My main point is, do you positively know that Cuba wasn't targeted, or are</i><br>
