From: Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Philosophically, the movie did not strike a unified tone, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;lurched from position to position.  We had speeches about the</i><br>
<i>&gt;benefits of immortality and post-biological man, but then there</i><br>
<i>&gt;was the one about how uploading can not work because you leave the</i><br>
<i>&gt;spirit behind with the body.  Finally we have the apparently</i><br>
<i>&gt;positive ending, which is inconsistent with what we have just been</i><br>
<i>&gt;shown.  If the girl lost her humanity by uploading, why won't it</i><br>
<i>&gt;happen to the guy?  Do we need the body, the soul, the spirit,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or don't we?  The movie doesn't address these questions, so the</i><br>
<i>&gt;ending just looks tacked-on to give something happy.  It doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;make any sense in the context of what had been presented before.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It would have worked better if, after the speculation about the</i><br>
<i>&gt;need for a body/soul/spirit which is lost by uploading, the other</i><br>
<i>&gt;character had challenged that explanation, saying that the girl</i><br>
<i>&gt;had never seemed too stable to begin with, and that the changes</i><br>
<i>&gt;relating to uploading had simply been too stressful for her to</i><br>
<i>&gt;handle.  He could argue that the basic idea was sound, but that</i><br>
<i>&gt;you need the right person as a subject, someone with a positive</i><br>
<i>&gt;mental outlook (namely, himself).  This would have at least made</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ending coherent.</i><br>
<p>
Very well put Hal.<br>
<p>
Yes they clearly had Juliet playing the femme fatale bit, if you<br>
remember she supposedly had broken the encryption on the AI's<br>
experiencial database before uploading, and was spying on the<br>
couple via the bedroom mounted camera.<br>
<p>
She was warped before uploading, then apeared to experience the<br>
"absolute power corrupts absolutely bit."<br>
<p>
Good review Hal<br>
