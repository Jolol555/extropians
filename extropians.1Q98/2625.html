The Declaration never had any force of law.  It can be referred to as<br>
a source of information about what the Framers might have meant by<br>
"proper" or "reasonable" or "rights retained", but it's not privileged<br>
in that respect.<br>
<p>
It's great for hitting Big Brother with the hypocrisy stick, though.<br>
"A government which still celebrates the anniversary of a document<br>
condemning certain practices, has embraced many of those practices..."<br>

so far so good<br>

Er, you mean 6 years?<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; same author.</i><br>
<p>
Well, the institutional author of the Constitution was a successor <br>
to the institutional author of the Declaration, but that's about it.<br>
