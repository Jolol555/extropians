In a message dated 98-02-02 13:24:27 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  Relativity doesn't say it's impossible <br>
 to move faster than light, it just says you can't send matter, energy or <br>
 information between two points faster, and an expanding universe does not do<br>
 this. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I didn't know that. Now I'm more confused than ever.<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Quantum Mechanics has modified the law of conservation of mass energy, it is<br>
passable to borrow mass energy from nothing, but you must pay it back, and <br>
the more you borrow the shorter you can keep it.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
OOoooookaaaaaay...<br>
<p>
It seems to me that youre saying  the big bang COULDN'T have happened then.<br>
Since if all the mass in the universe came from nothing then it couldn't stay<br>
around very long.<br>
<p>
However....if one proton at a time "virtualize" out of the quantum foam...then<br>
they could stay around for a VERY long time.  Which is my understanding of<br>
Lerner's thesis.<br>
<p>
As for the Galactic Electrical Currents..I understand (from the book) that<br>
evidence of their existence has been observed.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure of anything myself....nor am I claiming anything...I'm.just<br>
trying to sort it all out in terms I can understand.<br>
