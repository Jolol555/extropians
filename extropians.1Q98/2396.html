Hi.<br>
<p>
It was announced today that the company OpenMarket was granted patents for<br>
some basic web related devices.  More information can be found at<br>
<a href="http://www.openmarket.com">http://www.openmarket.com</a><br>
<p>
The patents include (among other things) a patent for using unique session<br>
identifiers on websites and a patent for the ubiquitous electronic shopping<br>
cart, filed in Jun95 and Oct94 respectively.<br>
<p>
Now, I am not a big fan of software patents in general, but what I find<br>
particularly distasteful about these is that I was personally involved in<br>
the development and public use of these two particular patents at least<br>
several months prior to the filing on both accounts and I know of even<br>
earlier usage by other people.  I read the documentation available on these<br>
patents and they describe, in detail, what we had been doing on<br>
public/commercial sites prior to the filing date.<br>
<p>
My question is: Does the prior, public usage by myself and other persons<br>
prior to the filing of these particular patents in anyway invalidate said<br>
patents?  Besides the fact that it is obscene to patent something so obvious<br>
and low on the ingenuity scale, I find myself severely irritated by their<br>
successful patent attempt of something that was already in the public domain<br>
for all intents and purposes.  Any programmer worth a damn would have<br>
devised such things on their own and, not surprisingly, many did.<br>
<p>
Okay.  That's enough for now.<br>
<p>
