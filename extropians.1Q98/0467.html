There has been some criticism to my original God post.  Most of it was<br>
directed towards the idea of not rejecting any theory that is not<br>
logically inconsistent and does not conflict with experiential evidence. <br>
The main objection to that was that there can be a huge number of<br>
theories to explain any phenomenon, and none of us have the time to<br>
consider all of them, so we must pick the sorts of theories which we<br>
prefer, usually the simplest ones.  This is perfectly true and rational. <br>
We must pick and choose which theories we will pay attention to.  But<br>
just because we choose one theory, that doesn't mean we should reject or<br>
deny the other ones.  Ignoring them is rational, but rejecting them is<br>
not.  Rejecting a theory is asserting that it is not true, and unless the<br>
theory is logically inconsistent or has evidence against it, then the<br>
assertion of its falsity is unsupported.<br>
<p>
I have no problem with people ignoring theories involving God, but I view<br>
*rejecting* those theories as flawed thinking.  Denying something without<br>
evidence or reason is just as bad as asserting something without evidence<br>
or reason.<br>
<p>
This sort of thinking error is very common and generally involves other<br>
issues besides God.  People often settle on one explanation for something<br>
and reject all other explanations.  This makes it very difficult for them<br>
to revise their thinking later when their understanding proves<br>
inadequate.  An explanation which they have rejected may be more<br>
appropriate in consideration of information they receive later.  It's<br>
more difficult to "un reject" a possible explanation than to simply not<br>
have eliminated it in the first place.<br>
<p>
This sort of cognitive error also happens at the perceptual level.  We<br>
usually refer to it as only being able to see things from a single<br>
perspective.  People get stuck interpreting their sensory information in<br>
a certain way and they have a difficult time seeing the world<br>
differently.  For example, many caucasian people perceive black people in<br>
a very negative way. That is only one out of many, many ways to see them,<br>
but deeply prejudiced people have rejected all the other ways of seeing<br>
them and are fixated on their ways of looking at them. <br>
<p>
Cognitive fixation slows down learning.  In my opinion, all beliefs and<br>
thoughts must be left subject to change.  The mind and belief systems<br>
must be in constant flux.  This way, ideas and beliefs can be in constant<br>
mutation and competition and in continual improvement.<br>
