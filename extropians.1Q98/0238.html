Scientists build living breasts<br>
<p>
 By Lois Rogers<br>
  Medical Correspondent<br>
<p>
<p>
 SCIENTISTS have pioneered a revolutionary technique to<br>
 grow breast tissue using cells from a woman's own body.<br>
 The treatment is to be offered to breast cancer victims as a<br>
 natural and safe alternative to silicone implants.<br>
<p>
 The development will revolutionise the treatment for<br>
 women who suffer disfiguring tumour surgery or<br>
 mastectomies and transform the cosmetic surgery industry.<br>
<p>
 Scientists in Boston, Massachusetts, have already grown<br>
 nipples and associated tissue from human cartilage cells;<br>
 the first clinical trials in which nipples will be transplanted<br>
 onto human patients are to begin later this year. Further<br>
 trials involving larger replacement sections of breast tissue<br>
 are planned to follow within 12 months. The researchers<br>
 predict whole breast transplants within five years.<br>
<p>
 The tissue engineers working on the project also expect to<br>
 be able to recreate the complex function of lactation and<br>
 produce a later version of the breast which will be capable<br>
 of making milk.<br>
<p>
 The regrown nipples, which have a natural firmness and<br>
 projection, take several weeks to grow. They are<br>
 produced from a small sample of fat and blood vessel cells<br>
 taken from the buttock or thigh. The cells are seeded onto<br>
 an artificial pre-shaped scaffolding of polymer plastic.<br>
 Growth factors are added to promote cell division, and<br>
 each cell reproduces itself once every 24 hours.<br>
<p>
 Once the scaffolding is full, cell division slows. The<br>
 polymer, which is similar to the material used for dissolving<br>
 stitches in the body, then begins to disappear, leaving a<br>
 completely natural section of tissue with its own blood<br>
 supply, replacing cells only as needed. Because it is<br>
 created from a woman's own body there is no problem of<br>
 the implant being rejected.<br>
<p>
 The project is being run by Reprogenesis, an American<br>
 company based in Boston, with university research teams<br>
 at the forefront of tissue engineering in Ann Arbor,<br>
 Michigan, and Charlotte, North Carolina.<br>
<p>
 The company intends the replacement breasts, which will<br>
 also be offered for the cosmetic breast market, to be<br>
 available within five years. "Our initial intention is to<br>
 provide an option for breast cancer patients, but the<br>
 method could be used for cosmetic reconstructions and it<br>
 has generated a lot of interest," said Shawn Stovall, the<br>
 company's spokesman.<br>
<p>
 David Mooney, assistant professor of chemical engineering<br>
 at the University of Michigan, said the innovation was the<br>
 first of its kind.<br>
<p>
 "We are growing a soft tissue that can replace a soft tissue.<br>
 The key element of this technology is that it uses a<br>
 woman's own cells and a biodegradable scaffolding or<br>
 matrix," he said.<br>
<p>
 Britain has one of the highest breast cancer rates in the<br>
 world. Every year 26,000 new cases are diagnosed and<br>
 about 10,000 of them require removal of a whole breast or<br>
 a large section of tissue. At present many patients resist<br>
 having replacements because they fear surgery or the<br>
 potential side effects from silicone implants, the principal<br>
 synthetic material used for breast reconstruction.<br>
<p>
 Ian Fentiman, professor of surgical oncology at Guy's<br>
 hospital in London, warned that the American researchers<br>
 would have to ensure they did not "re-seed" the cancer<br>
 cells by growing breasts from a woman's own tissue.<br>
 However, he added: "Anything which increases the options<br>
 has to be a good idea. The first question women ask is<br>
 about the dangers of silicone."<br>
<p>
 Continuing anxiety over silicone led the government to<br>
 commission a panel of scientists to review the evidence of<br>
 damage for a third time. Silicone implants can harden or<br>
 leak; they have also been linked to cancer, multiple<br>
 sclerosis and arthritis.<br>
<p>
 The British market for breast surgery is worth at least =A32m<br>
 a year. Many believe demand will soar if cancer patients<br>
 and those seeking an enhanced profile are offered a safe<br>
 and natural alternative to silicone.<br>
<p>
 Margo Cameron, who runs Silicone Support UK for<br>
 women with implants, said: "I get calls every week from<br>
 women who have been disfigured by cancer surgery or<br>
 who suffer torment from being flat-chested. They are all<br>
 desperate to know if there is anything that doesn't contain<br>
 silicone."<br>

UMMC Tissue Engineering Efforts Expands<br>
<p>
BIOTECH DEAL PAVES WAY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF "TISSUE PAINT"<br>
<p>
Technology could create alternative to breast implants<br>
<p>
WORCESTER, Mass. (Nov. 12, 1996) - The University of Massachusetts<br>
Medical Center has entered a biomedical research partnership with<br>
a Massachusetts tissue engineering company to further develop<br>
cutting-edge technology for growing human tissue in the laboratory<br>
-- and to explore its potential uses in surgical procedures ranging<br>
from breast reconstruction to orthopedic surgery.<br>
<p>
Officials today announced the signing of licensing and research<br>
agreements between the University of Massachusetts and<br>
Reprogenesis, Inc. A Boston-based firm, Reprogenesis is at the<br>
forefront of the biotechnology industry in researching the use of<br>
laboratory-grown cartilage -- as well as other kinds of tissue --<br>
in the treatment of injury and disease.<br>
<p>
Under the agreements, UMMC will receive a $100,000 upfront license<br>
fee; up to $2.3 million in milestone payments that will be made<br>
as clinical trials are initiated and as tissue engineered products<br>
reach the commercial market; $850,000 over three years in sponsored<br>
research support; and royalties on product sales.<br>
<p>
The research, to be conducted in UMMC's Tissue Engineering<br>
Laboratory, will be led by Charles A. Vacanti, MD, professor and<br>
chair of the Department of Anesthesiology at UMMC and one of the<br>
nation's top tissue engineering scientists. Vacanti's success in<br>
growing an ear from human cartilage cells -- considered an<br>
important advancement in tissue engineering -- has drawn widespread<br>
national and international media coverage during the past year.<br>
<p>
"This agreement represents yet another important milestone<br>
in UMass Medical Center's continuing development as a world-class<br>
academic health center," said Aaron Lazare, MD, chancellor/dean at<br>
UMMC. "Dr. Vacanti is a pioneer in the field of tissue<br>
engineering, and the partnership we've forged with Reprogenesis<br>
is a sterling example of how we use the intellectual resources<br>
and research expertise of UMMC to advance biomedical science,<br>
improve clinical care and bolster the state's economy."<br>
<p>
<p>
The agreements with Reprogenesis give the company the exclusive<br>
rights to develop, manufacture and sell a technology known as<br>
tissue paint -- a tissue engineering process developed by Vacanti<br>
in which autologous cells are harvested, grown in the laboratory,<br>
and then "painted" on various body cavities and organ<br>
surfaces. Vacanti's initial research with this technology has<br>
produced encouraging results.<br>
<p>
The potential clinical applications of Vacanti's tissue engineering<br>
technology will be examined in seven specific areas -- breast<br>
surgery; orthopedic surgery; cosmetic surgery; urology; skin and<br>
wound care; cardiovascular disease; and abdominal medicine.<br>
<p>
"Reprogenesis is poised to emerge as a leader among biotechnology<br>
companies in the development of tissue engineering technology<br>
and products,: Vacanti said. "I'm honored to have the opportunity<br>
to work with a Massachusetts company in a research and development<br>
endeavor that may produce a variety of new clinical applications<br>
for this technology, most notably in orthopedic and reconstructive<br>
surgery."<br>
<p>
Reprogenesis has been focusing on creating a substitute for breast<br>
implants from a patient's own cells and on using tissue-engineered<br>
cartilage in the treatment of urological disorders.<br>
<p>
The UMass-Reprogenesis agreement is the third public-private<br>
biotechnology partnership in recent months built upon the research<br>
expertise of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.<br>
University officials previously announced:<br>
<p>
a multi-million-dollar agreement with Smith &amp;amp; Nephew Endoscopy<br>
of Andover -- one of the world's foremost producers of minimally<br>
invasive surgical devices -- to jointly develop a center for<br>
research in endoscopic surgery at UMass-Worcester.<br>
<p>
a $42 million licensing agreement with Pasteur Meriuex-Connaught<br>
-- one of the world's largest manufacturers of vaccines -- for<br>
the development of a new technology for producing vaccines.<br>
<p>
All three licensing agreements were negotiated by the University<br>
of Massachusetts' Office of Commercial Ventures and Intellectual<br>
Property, which is responsible for licensing and marketing<br>
technologies developed by researchers working at UMMC and at the<br>
four other UMass campuses.<br>
<p>
Tissue engineering is a relatively new field in which autologous<br>
human cells are harvested and grown in the laboratory -- with<br>
the ultimate intent of implanting those &amp;quot;engineered&amp;quot;<br>
cells elsewhere in the body and having them grow to form new<br>
functional tissue. Using the tissue engineering process, scientists<br>
have been able to grow human skin, cartilage, ligament, bone and<br>
other tissue.<br>
<p>
In addition to the much-publicized cartilage ear, Vacanti has<br>
grown tracheas, ligaments, tendons and bone. He is co-editor and<br>
a member of the executive editorial board of Tissue Engineering,<br>
and the founding president of the international Tissue Engineering<br>
Society (TES). Vacanti will present his tissue engineering work<br>
at the first TES meeting December 13-15 in Orlando, Florida.<br>
<p>
Vacanti is also a reviewer for the New England Journal of Medicine,<br>
the Journal of Clinical Anesthesiology and Biomaterials.<br>
He has lectured to medical audiences throughout the country, and<br>
has authored articles on tissue engineering for numerous<br>
publications, including Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Bone<br>
Repair and Regeneration. <br>
<p>
One of the University's five campuses, UMass Medical Center is<br>
a dynamic, multifaceted academic health center that includes the<br>
state's only public medical school as well as graduate schools<br>
in biomedical sciences and nursing. UMMC receives more than $60<br>
million annually in federal and private grants, and ranks second<br>
among the 10 public medical schools in the Northeast in research<br>
funding.<br>
<p>
<p>
The good/bad news is that Reprogenesis is currently privately held,<br>
I talked with their General Manager, and he's added me to a mailing<br>
list for company info.<br>
