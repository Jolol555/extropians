I hate to sound snotty, but can you read?  Let me quote myself:<br>
<p>
 "I've also noticed that many people who call themselves "secular<br>
 humanist" are really just using the term as a euphemism for<br>
 "atheist.""<br>
<p>
Note the use of "noticed" above.  In other words, I've met people<br>
who called themselves "secular humanists" who when pressed<br>
really couldn't go much beyond the fact that they did not believe<br>
in a God or gods or other supernatural stuff.<br>
<p>
(I only went through this exercise because you countered an<br>
earlier post of someone else's by not responding to his actual<br>
content but to what you thought you read.)<br>
<p>
As an abstract idea, I would, for the most part agree with you.<br>
Secular humanism is atheistic, but atheism is not necessarily<br>
secular humanistic.  But people don't usually like to use clear<br>
terms to define and delimit themselves.  Hence, I believe many<br>
people adopt a secular humanist mantle merely to avoid being<br>
seen as negators -- i.e., as standing against religion instead of<br>
for humanity -- and the term "atheist" has a certain connotation,<br>
we must admit, that is, in the USA, not good.<br>
<p>
I've also met people who called themselves "Christian humanists."<br>
I bet in their view, "humanism" does not presuppose "atheism."<br>
<p>
As for me, "atheist" will do just fine as a label and I leave the<br>
secular humanists to whatever vageries they expose.<br>
