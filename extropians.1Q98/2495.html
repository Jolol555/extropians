      Some questions for Reilly Jones &amp; other "pro-lifers":<br>
      Are you willing to be annihilated &amp; then cloned back from a single <br>
cell (leaving you with everything you had at conception?)<br>
Are you willing to be forced to endure the discomforts&amp; risks of <br>
pregnancy- morning sickness, weight gain, fluid retention, hormonal and <br>
neurotransmitter changes, all of it?  If not, why should this be <br>
*forced* on anyone else?  In particular, why should anyone claiming to <br>
act for "society" have the right to force such further indignities on  <br>
a rape victim?<br>
    Are you willing to suffer tremendous agony &amp; risk death to give <br>
birth, and then give up many other things in life to care for the <br>
resulting person for 18+ years?  Are you willing to have others define <br>
your "proper role" largely in terms of having and caring for children,<br>
regardless of your wishes?  If not, why would you inflict this on any-<br>
one else against their will?  Because *she* is female?  Because she <br>
engaged in pleasurable friction with a male some time earlier?<br>
    And why on earth is it desirable to allow "bans on cloning or <br>
other enhancements"?  Why give Jeremy "Ned Ludd, Jr." Rifkin &amp; his <br>
army of brainwashed zombies "from 20,000 centuries deep" as Ayn Rand<br>
might say, more ammo to fight their holy war with?<br>
