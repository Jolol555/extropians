<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The biggest Scandinavian ship was, according to "Aspects of Maritime</i><br>

<i>&gt; tons in cargo size [1].</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My memory was a bit wrong, the biggest ships that were allowed to enter the</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cargo ships of more than 1200 net tonnage (the size of the Roman ISIS, of</i><br>
<i>&gt; which type at least 60 to 80 ships existed, because of the high wheat</i><br>
<i>&gt; requirements of the empire, however, it was probably much more) were only</i><br>
<i>&gt; built again in 1800 (!) in larger series [2].</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nelson's "Victory" had 3000 brutto register tons, the ISIS had 2900 BRT.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Conclusion: The biggest Scandinavian ships would barely have been allowed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; enter the Roman harbour, and the *biggest* late MA / early Renaissance</i><br>
<i>&gt; Venecian ships were still under the *average* Roman size.</i><br>
<p>
And how does one parameter, the gross tonnage of the average vessel, apply to<br>
naval technology? Not at all. For example: in WWII, the largest Japanese vessels<br>
were the Yamato Class battleships, at around 75,000 tons, and a little known<br>
large aircraft carrier program that was never finished that had a vessel size of<br>
100,000 tons. THe most advanced US vessels were the Essex class carriers<br>
(~50,000 tons) and the Missouri class battleships (~65,000 tons).  The Japanese<br>
carrier was to carry over 150 aircraft, while the US Essex was to carry less<br>
than 100. The Yamato battleship had 18 inch main guns, while the USS Missouri<br>
had only 16 inch main guns, as well as half the total number of guns as the<br>
Yamato. Yet the US vessels were technologically several years advanced ahead of<br>
the Japanese vessels. They had radar and gun ballistics computers, for starters.<br>
<p>
As for Roman vessels, the Isis class vessel, was, as I recall, mostly a<br>
glorified self propelled grain barge. Hardly a feat of naval engineering, and<br>
more a matter of economics than engineering. Its not surprising that such<br>
vessels were not needed during the middle ages, as population was less, trade<br>
was less, and what was left of Rome couldn't afford fine Libyan wheat (which was<br>
the point of the Isis, to ship wheat from North Africa to feed Rome (the 'bread'<br>
part of the 'bread and circuses')). I also would doubt highly that the Isis<br>
could do more than 6-8 knots or survive more than 6-8 foot seas. The smaller<br>
middle ages vessels were more seaworthy, built for the North Atlantic, not the<br>
calm Mediterranean.<br>
