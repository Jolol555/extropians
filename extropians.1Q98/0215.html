Over at Hypermart, we have considered implementing our own<br>
internal economy. We offer free hosting for businesses, and<br>
the way it currently works is that each and every business<br>
gets the exact same set of features (10MB of space, their<br>
own mycompany.hypermart.net domain, unlimited bandwidth, etc.).<br>
We use regular NNTP-based newsgroups for most of our user<br>
interaction, and have a couple of "help" newsgroups where we<br>
find many of the users answer questions that get posted even<br>
before we can get to them.<br>
<p>
What we are considering is giving members a set amount of credits<br>
when they join and they can decide what services they need<br>
to have. So one person might really need some Real Audio<br>
streams, but only need 5 megs of space, or someone might need<br>
20 megs of space but don't need their own domain, etc. Then<br>
they could earn additional credits by answering problems,<br>
finding abusers on our system, and whatever else we can think<br>
of.<br>
<p>
At any rate, I think what we are considering expands on the<br>
type of thing at experts-exchange by offering our hosting<br>
services in a kind of internal market economy, where the "costs"<br>
of our various services would fluctuate depending on how much<br>
demand there is for each of them. I think this would allow us<br>
to offer some services like Real Audio or NT hosting that cost<br>
us $$$ without having to buy enough streams/servers for everyone.<br>

<i>&gt; I have come across a site that some of you may have already seen, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; from what I can see, is an excellent indication of the beginnings of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; completely virtual economy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Check out <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/">http://www.experts-exchange.com/</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What it is, is an independent technical support site for all sorts of</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer software/OS's/equipment/etc. that is operated by its members.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The way it works is you register as a user. Initial registration gives</i><br>
<i>&gt; you 300 'points' to spend on asking technical questions of people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; are registered as 'experts'. There are no qualification requirements to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be an expert, you just have to also register as an expert if you feel</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can contribute, and users acknowledge that they cannot hold the</i><br>
<i>&gt; exchange nor the 'experts' responsible for the advice given. Anyone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; is an expert can offer suggested solutions, and if one works, the user</i><br>
<i>&gt; can confirm the successful solution, evaluate the quality of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; solution given, and award the points they originally bid, plus any</i><br>
<i>&gt; quality points based on the grading by the user, to the account of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; expert who was correct.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here is the financial thing I am getting at: Once you 'spend' all of</i><br>
<i>&gt; your 300 initial points, you can buy more points for $0.10 a piece. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; means that for experts, they can themselves earn points that they can</i><br>
<i>&gt; use for free support from experts in other areas. While this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; currently a closed system that obviously requires input from 'real</i><br>
<i>&gt; money', this could eventually build up enough of a 'point supply' to act</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a mini economy of its own, and this is a harbinger for being expanded</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a whole slew of internet products and services that would  eventually</i><br>
<i>&gt; independent of the real money system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I registered as both user and expert. I then went to the directory of</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions on the NT operating system, hoping to find that someone else</i><br>
<i>&gt; had asked, and hopefully gotten a solution to, that case sensitivity bug</i><br>
<i>&gt; I had found in NT last week (as you can 'purchase' the solutions to</i><br>
<i>&gt; previously asked questions for a discount from the original solution</i><br>
<i>&gt; cost). I found a guy who was asking a quesiton about RAM vs. virtual</i><br>
<i>&gt; memory allocation, which I knew the answer to, so I replied with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; answer, as well as with another related tip for increasing performance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; THe original bid by the user for the solution was 50 points, but he said</i><br>
<i>&gt; my solution improved his performance so much that I got 200 points for</i><br>
<i>&gt; such a quality answer. So now I've got 500 points to spend on support</i><br>
<i>&gt; quesitons of my own. I earned $20 worth of support with just 5 minutes</i><br>
<i>&gt; of typing. How bout that???</i><br>
