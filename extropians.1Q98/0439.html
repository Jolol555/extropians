<i>&gt; &gt; From:          Robin Helweg-Larsen &lt;robinhl@vnet.net&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Anyone know the validity of the story that drinking seawater makes you crazy?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Do people survive on a raft by drinking seawater, or do they have to catch</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rainwater?  Maybe not drinking enough (sea)water makes them crazy?</i><br>
<p>
People on life rafts have to collect rainwater, and also can derive <br>
significant fluids from eating fish (if they can catch any).  Also, <br>
life rafts often carry an inflatable "solar still" which looks like a <br>
beach ball floating in the ocean and distills fresh water from sea.  <br>
More recently, life rafts have taken to carrying reverse osmosis <br>
filters which rely on hand pumping to provide pressure (this is what <br>
we had when I worked on the Shell Venture).<br>
<p>
Drinking sea water causes the body to excrete more fluids, making <br>
things worse than not drinking at all.  I don't know about "crazy", <br>
but I have seen people who have accidentally become severely <br>
dehydrated and they definately start losing touch with reality.  <br>
Also, I can well imagine going crazy trying *not* to drink the sea <br>
water after a day or two without fluids.<br>
