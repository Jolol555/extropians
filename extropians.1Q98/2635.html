They won't go after a single breach, since the damage is already done. <br>
It is the mass delivery systems that they would go after.  Look at the<br>
legal battles over PGP and ask Mr. Zimmerman if the Government lets<br>
minor breaches go unnoticed.  In his case, I don't think he broke any<br>
laws, but the Government still tried to suppress him.<br>
<p>
Another thing to remember is that such cases are sometimes publicized by<br>
the defendant for publicity purposes.  The Government rarely<br>
acknowledges such security enforcement, unless forced to do so.  They<br>
usually view the details of the security risk, its detection and its<br>
resolution as also security matters to be kept quiet.<br>
<p>
When I tracked down hackers for Government sites (in a former<br>
incarnation), most of the persons tracked were not dealt with through<br>
"normal" channels.  Because of the classified status of certain<br>
projects, the police and local governments could not be informed of the<br>
event or its investigation.  Many of the activities were performed<br>
outside (or above?) the law.  This is all authorized by various<br>
Government Agencies and congressional acts.  The result is that various<br>
secret groups with police powers are formed that act independently of<br>
known police and legal procedures.<br>
<p>
I like to tell people that I enjoy watching the X-files because it is so<br>
realistic of Government process as I have seen it.<br>
