David notes:<br>
&lt; since I am someone with Bipoar Disorder<br>
(manic-depression), I occasionally go into a<br>
hypomanic state of mind.  In a hypomanic state of<br>
mind, I feel much more curious, sociable, assertive,<br>
have much more confidence and willpower and have a<br>
quicker, more intelligent and creative mind.  The<br>
hypomanic state is common for people with Bipolar<br>
Disorder, and it is believed to be chemically induced<br>
and has a profound effect on the personality.&gt;<br>
<p>
I recall when you disappeared from the list after<br>
suddenly falling into a condition of despair.  I<br>
hope, with your expertise in mental disciplines, you<br>
now have this under control.<br>
<p>
The most common, if illegal, nootropic of choice<br>
seems capable of inducing mild (in most cases)<br>
versions of this condition.  For some people, I think<br>
the resulting imbalance can manifest as anxiety or<br>
even aggressiveness instead of depression.<br>
<p>
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibition (SSRI)<br>
definitely is involved here.  SSRI substances are<br>
normally recommended only for people suffering from<br>
clinical depression; however, there seems to be some<br>
evidence that they may be helpful, as well, for the<br>
other conditions mentioned above.<br>
<p>
Some data suggest that for someone used to regular,<br>
though not excessive, consumption of alcohol and/or<br>
other common psycho-active stimulants, SSRIs can<br>
significantly reduce the craving for these and assist<br>
in creating a stable condition of mild 'hypomania' (a<br>
sense of curiosity, calm and enhanced awareness of<br>
patterns).<br>
<p>
The most well-known SSRI is Prozac, which has some<br>
nasty side effects.  However, I have found that the<br>
herbal extract of Hypericum (St. John's Wort -<br>
available wherever they sell a variety of herbal<br>
extracts) IS absolutely amazing in this context -<br>
much more reliable than, say, piracetam.<br>
<p>
BTW, <a href="http://dog.net.uk/claude/ghb-1.html">http://dog.net.uk/claude/ghb-1.html</a> provides<br>
some interesting history on GHB and why U.S.<br>
pharmaceutical companies supposedly had no interest<br>
in seeing it promoted in the U.S.  A Net search on<br>
GHB will turn up the story of how it was 'outlawed'<br>
in the U.S. back in the 80s by some biased FDA<br>
reports (if I remember correctly).<br>
