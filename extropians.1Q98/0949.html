<i>&gt; have of responsibly creating policies?</i><br>
<p>
The only real areas that have any measure of controlling the pace of<br>
advancement are the supply of the capital markets to new technology<br>
businesses, government funding for research, and the market's demand for new<br>
features and capabilities. Because there isn't one area that has monopoly<br>
control, if you try to limit one, the others will tend to compensate, and if<br>
you limit them all, I would expect other, presently less influential paths,<br>
will come to the fore. If government doesn't want what is happening, they<br>
really only have the choice of either abdicating, or invoking a worldwide<br>
'cultural revolution' to end the trends that began with the Rennaissance.<br>
They cannot have their cake and eat it too.<br>
<p>
People, as individuals, are tending to fall into two groups, which is<br>
directly related to the level with which they as individuals use new<br>
technologies, and with how late in life they as individuals are still<br>
capable of new learning and growth. In the 60's, grandparents couldn't<br>
relate to just about anything their grandkids were doing, as their personal<br>
paradigms were calcified and obsolescent with the current and emerging<br>
status quos, which aided the desctruction of the extended family. Today, the<br>
trend is that parents are experiencing the same dysfunction with respect to<br>
their kids. Parents who have trouble with, or can't program a VCR or set up<br>
a sereo system, are totally oblivious to the manner in which their kids<br>
easily become computer capable like fish to water.<br>
<p>
The old societal paradigm was that the parents and grandparents taught the<br>
children about getting along in the world, but today it is reversed, with<br>
kids being the instructors in the use of technology. At my local community<br>
college, most of the computer course instructors are in their 20's and early<br>
30's, while most of the students are older. For people raised in a time when<br>
elders were the respected members of society, this is a highly jarring<br>
experience, to have to take instruction from 'young whippersnappers'.<br>
<p>
In order to overcome this, there needs to be widespread dissemination of<br>
exercises for stretching the mind, keeping it fit and flexible late in life.<br>
However, I think that the public anti-tech furor is mostly the last gasps of<br>
the beatnik and hippie adherents to an acadian reverence for technological<br>
simplicity. There is a possibility of a New Amish subculture forming<br>
(remember, the original Amish live by technology that was current at the<br>
start of the industrial revolution) here at the beginning of the information<br>
revolution, but those who do not take an active role in such separating<br>
efforts will merely die out and be replaced by people who are already today<br>
living with attitudes of flexibility, who rejoice in change.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Alternatively the question becomes: "Is the guiding force of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government sufficient to responsibly ensure human survival in the face</i><br>
<i>&gt; of rapidly advancing technology? If not, what is the solution?"</i><br>
<p>
Is the guiding force of technology sufficient to responsibly ensure human<br>
survival in the face of the continuing threat of extermination and<br>
oppression by obsolescent government organizations, and the narrowminded and<br>
unfounded fears of willingly obsolete people who exercise undue influence<br>
over those governments?<br>
