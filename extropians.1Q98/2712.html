If you're interested in Social Security, I just read about what could be a<br>
really engaging web event, hosted by Americans Discuss Social Security (a<br>
project of The Pew Charitable Trusts) that is taking place on Saturday March<br>
21st.  They are calling this event a ten-city interactive video<br>
teleconference.  It is being held in 10 cities, but they're also broadcasting<br>
it on the web.  They say that people on their web site (www.adss.org) will be<br>
able to chat with the conference moderator and participate in the conference<br>
polling.  I haven't seen anything like this on the web before and I am really<br>
interested in Social Security.  Apparently this organization plans to engage<br>
citizens in a national dialogue on Social Security reform but does not take a<br>
position on Social Security reform.  So this should be interesting.   If you<br>
want more information, the url is adss.org.  See you there!<br>
