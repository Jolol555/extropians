Yak Wax:<br>
<i>&gt;You've made a big mistake here, I don't want to "recommend sexual</i><br>
<i>&gt;activities prior to proper maturity" I want to not "stop sexual</i><br>
<i>&gt;activity before 'proper maturity.'"  Thus, it is not up to me to prove</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything, but up to you to prove that we *do* need to stop sexual</i><br>
<i>&gt;activities before maturity.  </i><br>
<p>
To the contrary, if one plans to turn the course of current<br>
psychological theory, one would have to provide some hard data to<br>
support a new position, such as a study or a critical analysis of<br>
present theory.  If you are able to provide that type of evidence,<br>
then your case for pedophila would merit consideration.  My position <br>
at this time is that I have not yet seen such evidence, either in my <br>
own research or in the postings on this thread.  <br>
