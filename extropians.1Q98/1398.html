  Famous science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke,<br>
  author of the sci-fi epic "2001: A Space Odyssey,"<br>
  denies the shocking report published in a British<br>
  tabloid, the Sunday Mirror [1], that he admitted <br>
  to the Mirror that he was a pedophile. As the <br>
  Associated Press (2/2/98) just reportED [2]:<br>
<p>
	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Science <br>
	fiction author Arthur C. Clarke today <br>
	denied a British tabloid's claim that <br>
	he is a pedophile and asked that his <br>
	knighthood ceremony be postponed so<br>
	not to embarrass Prince Charles. <br>
<p>
	"I am outraged by the Sunday Mirror's<br>
	allegations, and I am seeking legal <br>
	advice," Clarke said in a statement <br>
	read to reporters by his secretary, <br>
	Roshan Amarasekhara. <br>
<p>
	"Mr. Clarke is very upset by the <br>
	false reports," Amarasekhara added. <br>
<p>
  Take the "Arthur C. Clarke admits he was a pedo-<br>
  phile" report with a very big grain of salt. Re-<br>
  member CNN's "Goddard admits TWA 800 theory was <br>
  a hoax" hoax <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/hoax.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/hoax.htm</a> <br>
  I suspect and seriously hope that Clarke has been <br>
  set up rather than that these charges be true.<br>
<p>
  The Mirror article sounds bad, but it could be <br>
  a pack of lies. The Mirror reporters could have <br>
  just made up everything. Where's the proof that <br>
  he said that the Mirror claims he said? Without<br>
  a recorded interview, this report has no legal<br>
  and thus very little weight. When we consider<br>
  that making such shocking charges stands to <br>
  sell a lot of newspapers, we can say that <br>
  Mirror had a motive to fabricate. <br>
<p>
  I cannot imagine that Arthur C. Clarke, even <br>
  if the charges were true, would say what he's<br>
  alleged to have said.  We need to wait till<br>
  we get all the facts before we can pass our<br>
  personal judgement on Arthur C. Clarke. <br>
<p>
  IF the story is true I still respect the great <br>
  contributions the man has made to society, but <br>
  would strongly condemn such sexual behavior. I <br>
  think that because all adults are inherently <br>
  authoritarian figures to all children, that the<br>
  concept of "consensual adult/child sex" is in-<br>
  herently and fatally flawed, since any alleged<br>
  consent of the child cannot be determined in<br>
  light of the fact that the authoritarian rela-<br>
  tion inherently contains an intimidation factor.<br>

 IDENTITY MATRIX | I D E N T I T Y   C O N S E R V A T I O N <br>
-----------------| The basis of  logic  is identity (ID). The<br>
      1  2       | basis ID is difference. Degrees of differ-<br>
     ______      | ence can be  quantified as ID units, which<br>
  1 | 0  1 |     | are numerical ID attributes. The ID Matrix<br>
<i>    |      |     | shows the ID units of two numbers, and may</i><br>
  2 |-1  0 |     | do so unto  infinity.  The ID unit of each<br>
    --------     | is derived from the other,  and thus ID is<br>
_________________| holistic, not atomistic. The sum of all ID<br>
units to infinity equals zero, and therefore ID is conserved.<br>
