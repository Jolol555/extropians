I've just received a review copy (from the USA - White Wolf Publishing,<br>
1997, I assume just out) of SILICON KARMA, by Thomas A. Easton.  He's the<br>
book reviewer for *Analog*, who in the early '90s wrote several books about<br>
`gengineering'.  This one deals with uploading.  I've only just started it,<br>
but it contains some interesting early posits - scanning is<br>
non-destructive, and copies live sequestered in manipulable VR machine<br>
space: `philosophers and ethicists and theologians insisted that the divide<br>
be respected, that the dead have their afterlives to themselves.  Seeing<br>
them is too painful for both the living and the dead' (p. 11).  This seems<br>
to me unlikely, and probably just a convenient narrative device, but it's<br>
an idea I'd never encountered before.<br>
