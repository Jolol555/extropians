<i>&gt; I think there is a great deal of apprehension on this list toward</i><br>
<i>&gt; the words "movement", "ideology" and the like.  I don't think it</i><br>
<i>&gt; does much good to do all kinds of handwaving, denying, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; neologizing to avoid such terms.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Absolutely!  The best way to combat irrational emotional reactions<br>
to accurate words is to "reclaim" them; to use them proudly and<br>
without apology.<br>
<p>
It is a shame that in our culture in general, "idealistic" has<br>
become an insult and "practical" a compliment, rather than the <br>
reverse, as they deserve.<br>
<p>
Even I must admit that there are times when surrendering to<br>
pragmatism is appropriate, as when one hands one's wallet over<br>
to a thief with a gun in your back, but it should always be seen<br>
as a defeat.  Pragmatism is failure.  Somewhere in our culture,<br>
it became not only acceptable, but desirable.<br>
<p>
I am an ideologue, and proud of it.  I have no respect at all<br>
for those who /start/ an argument from pragmatism instead of<br>
settling for it when idealism fails.  Masking over our own<br>
idealism for the sake of PR is exactly that--it is settling<br>
for defeat before we have even tried sticking to principle.<br>
A principled movement wants people to support its goals; if it<br>
sacrifices those goals just to get people, what are those people<br>
for?  Such a movement, where numbers of people are a goal in<br>
itself, is no longer a principled movement, and is forever<br>
doomed to success in its mediocrity.<br>
