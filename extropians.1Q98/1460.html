<i>        &gt;Quantum Mechanics has modified the law of conservation of mass        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;energy, it is possible to borrow mass energy from nothing, but you         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;must pay it back, and the more you borrow the shorter you can keep it.</i><br>

Look at it this way, the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle says that there is  <br>
a relationship between position and momentum, the more you know about one the  <br>
less you know about the other, the same relationship holds for energy and <br>
time. If you measure the energy in a vacuum over a short time interval there <br>
will be a large amount of uncertainty over how much energy is there. You can't <br>
observe it but over extremely short periods of time there is nothing to <br>
prevent huge amounts of energy from being there, enough to make  matter, <br>
if fact enough to make every particle  known. Most believe that Nature is <br>
totalitarian, if it's not forbidden it's mandatory, so some people started to <br>
think that these particles, called virtual particles, might really exist.<br>
          <br>
You might think that this is all pointless philosophy, like arguing about how <br>
many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but Richard Feynman proved that <br>
it has observable consequences, like the Lamb shift in the spectrum of the <br>
Hydrogen atom or the photon shot noise of a LASER. Even though there an   <br>
infinite number of these virtual particles Feynman showed how they effect<br>
real particles, you can calculate with Feynman's theory and get numbers. <br>
  <br>
Calculating the effect an infinite number of virtual particles would have on  <br>
an electron, Feynman predicted in 1948 that the magnetic moment of an electron <br>
can't be exactly 1 as had been thought but must be 1.00115965221 . Amazingly, <br>
the best modern experiments give a figure of 1.00115965221 with an uncertainty<br>
of 3 in the last digit. He couldn't have been guessing, nobody's that lucky,  <br>
Feynman must have been on to something important.<br>
          <br>

<i>        &gt;It seems to me that youre saying  the big bang COULDN'T have happened         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;then. Since if all the mass in the universe came from nothing then it         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;couldn't stay around very long.</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
Quantum Mechanics doesn't even have a theory of gravity so it's certainly not <br>
ready to explain why there is something rather than nothing.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;As for the Galactic Electrical Currents..I understand (from the book)         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that evidence of their existence has been observed.</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Currents strong enough to explain how a Quasar, an object smaller than the  <br>
solar system, can produce a thousand times as much energy as a galaxy of 500 <br>
billion suns? Even if we knew for sure that such currents existed, and we <br>
don't, it still wouldn't answer the basic question, what huge power source <br>
generated them, where did the energy come from? Gravitational collapse is the  <br>
only thing known to be able to produce that much energy in such a small  <br>
amount of space.<br>
