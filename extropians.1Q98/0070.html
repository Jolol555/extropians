I have been wondering about living for ever and ever. That if I was<br>
uploaded and running a Gazillion times faster than now, and living<br>
Billions of times longer than now.<br>
<p>
Wouldn't life at some point get boring?<br>
<p>
As far as I can see the solution is to not only become a weak super<br>
intelligence. But to actually become more intelligent.<br>
<p>
As I am now, the only things that i find interesting are the things I<br>
find hard. Compare something like tic tac toe to chess. Any adult<br>
playing tic tac toe and concentrating about it can hardly loose. At the<br>
same time chess is a very complex game. The rules are a little harder,<br>
but the main challenge comes in the complexity of the system and all of<br>
the possible variations.<br>
<p>
I find things interesting right now that animals doesn't. Storytelling,<br>
Pretty pictures, music, science, philosophy, mathematics (well sort of),<br>
Probably as a &gt;H i will find things interesting too that I can't even<br>
comprehend or fathom right now. Therefore I think it will be a long time<br>
before I will get bored.<br>
<p>
Thus Max M's first rule of &gt;H ;-) is:<br>
<p>
As i get more intelligent and understands the problems I currently have,<br>
i will find new and interesting problems.<br>
<p>
I Look forward to chess being as transparent to me as tic tac toe is<br>
right now, and me playing some kind of 1000'th dimensional checkers.<br>
<p>
Or maybe then I will still try to understand my own mind which will<br>
probably race ahead of my "self" in complexity.<br>
