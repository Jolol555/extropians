In an earlier message....I said.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; Skipping ahead a bit...Sheffield says...in regard to the Red Shift (the<br>
<i> &gt; genesis for the idea of the big bang) ..."the most plausible mechanism, to</i><br>
a<br>
<i> &gt; physicist, is the doppler effect'  </i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; Oh?  That implies there are OTHER mechanisms?  I wonder what they are?</i><br>
<p>
And then Hal said....<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;. Ironically, doppler shift is probably *not* the best way of thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of the cosmological redshifts.  Rather, what happens is that photons</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; are emitted by the galaxies, then as they travel, spacetime expands</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and the photons get "stretched".  Their wavelength lengthens, which</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;is a redshift.  Doppler shift is quite misleading when dealing with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; cosmological distances.</i><br>
 <br>
And in a similar but different discussion Nick Bostrom said<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;So if that expansion </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;rate settles down to a constant, then there must be a sphere centered </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;around Earth such that nothing that is outside of that sphere can </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;*ever* affect Earth, even if it travels with the speed of light.</i><br>
<p>
To which Damien Broderick replied. <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I believe you have just reinvented the canonical explanation for Olbers'</i><br>
<i>&gt; Paradox.</i><br>
<p>
And Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin replied<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We can also use this to set bounds on the expansion rate.  The </i><br>
<i>&gt;diameter of the sphere is set by the expansion rate, and we can (by </i><br>
<i>&gt;definition) observe the edges of the observable universe, but nothing </i><br>
<i>&gt;beyond those edges.</i><br>
<p>
Me again...<br>
<p>
I find this very interesting...but puzzeling...<br>
<p>
For one thing...there's a "constant" problem that's (vaugely) bothering<br>
me.....<br>
<p>
If EVERYTHING is expanding...(The girl, the gold watch...and<br>
everything)...then why should a red shift be noticeable?  Is this Eienstein's<br>
non-intuitive relativity theory again...?  To me it would appear that for a<br>
red shift to be noticable there would have to be SOME type of constant...by<br>
which velocity, expansion...or whatever is measured against...if  "Space-Time"<br>
is expanding...(which includes light)...then how would we know?  And what<br>
difference would it make?<br>
<p>
Another thing Charles Sheffeild said which also bothers me....<br>
<p>
"We can go further, at least in theory, to the time, 10-35 sec After Creation,<br>
when the universe went through a superrapid "inflationary " phase, growing<br>
from the size of a proton to the size of a basket ball in about 5 x 10-32<br>
seconds....<br>
<p>
to which he foot notes<br>
<p>
""SuperRapid" is an appropriate description.  Druing the inflation period the<br>
universe was expanding in size MILLIONS OF TIMES FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF<br>
LIGHT .  This does not violate the theory of relativity, since no signal is<br>
being propagated..."<br>
<p>
Curiosior and curiousior......<br>
<p>
Also  he said..<br>
<p>
"The universe may have been created out of nothing, by a zero energy<br>
fluctuation.  And one day it may simply disappear, when the vacuum flutuation<br>
that created it pops out of existence."<br>
<p>
Now....if I understand correctly....Lerner  (The Big Bang Never Happened)...is<br>
proposing something similar...but on a proton by proton basis...that is a<br>
vacuum fluctuation "creates" a proton...(uncounted zillions of<br>
them...constantly)...they coalesce to form hyrdogen...galaxies and whatever<br>
(the carbon cycle)...and eventually go "poof" decay...on an individual<br>
basis...<br>
<p>
Current cosmological theory holds that the entire universe is the result of a<br>
vacuum flux?....which is expanding ....and will eventually "pop"...like a soap<br>
bubble?<br>
<p>
Now what was Ander's saying about angles dancing on the head of a pin?<br>
<p>
