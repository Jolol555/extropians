Alright, time for a different approach:<br>
<p>
Justice is not revenge.  So let me rephrase my original statement -<br>
"Maybe justice isn't the best solution, maybe there's something<br>
better."  Now, the problem with our perception of justice is that we<br>
see it as the enforcement of good.  So just to make life more complex,<br>
I'm disputing the idea of what is good and what is evil (and what is<br>
anything inbetween.)  I would especially dispute the idea of a<br>
"greater good" and although some things may be good for society (which<br>
I understand to mean "all of us") justice is a purely subjective<br>
concept based on individual preferences.  But we seem to treat it as<br>
something greater, our current justice system is there to enforce the<br>
law of the state, when it is and should be, an individuals choice as<br>
to what he/she considers right or wrong.<br>
