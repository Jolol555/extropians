Chances are the kit we are talking about, in its initial version would be<br>
closer to the 10 test and not 100 test side of the spectrum.  I would<br>
imagine that anything that is abnormal can be reported to an expert<br>
or backed up with more tests.<br>
<p>
Perhaps the kit could be a way of having physicians remotely<br>
monitor patients.  That could be the initial market, with all the aging<br>
babyboomers creeping toward senescence...<br>
