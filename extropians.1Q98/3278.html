<p>
I do not think Damien was commenting specifically on this thread, more on a<br>
general feeling he has after having been on the list for a few years.<br>
I would think that, if it were only from a PR-viewpoint, the fact that he<br>
has such feelings would be reason for concern. Mind you, Damien is someone<br>
who knows many people on this list. What would a complete outsider think if<br>
he read this post as without all the background info (about this list in<br>
general) we all have? We do care what the rest of the world thinks or not?<br>
Based on some selective quotes from the ExI-archives it must be quite easy<br>
by now to paint Transhumanists/Extropians as a bunch of pretty scary people.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;This is nothing new on this list; we've seen many arguments in the past that</i><br>
<i> &gt;the vast majority of people would be worthless to the first post-humans and</i><br>
<i> &gt;would be wiped out. The only difference seems to be that I'm pointing out</i><br>
<i> &gt;that the situation is different today only in scale.</i><br>
<p>
Let's recap _that_<br>
<p>
'The vast majority of people would be worthless to the first post-Humans'<br>
<p>
I'll agree with that, as I stated before we are already seeing the<br>
beginning of this trough advances in automation, IMHO this is one of the<br>
great social problems of the near-future.<br>
<p>
'and would be wiped out'<br>
<p>
The way this is stated makes it sound asif many extropians have accepted<br>
this as a fact-accompli (well, that's how can be interpreted anyway). Have<br>
you?<br>
<p>
Now, please replace 'people' by, say, 'mentally-retarded persons'. To bring<br>
this logic to todays society. Down-syndrome patients seem to be fairly<br>
useless (from an economic standpoint anyway, as humans they can be great).<br>
<p>
Need I say more?<br>
<p>
I've always felt that the lenghts to which we go to protect and care for<br>
the weaker members of the species was one of the key things that set humans<br>
apart from animals (certainly one of the most admirable).<br>
<p>
I think we need to have a serious discussion about the possible<br>
PR-consequences of statements like these. Maybe I should stay totally out<br>
of it, being a guest on this list, but I really think this issue should be<br>
adressed.<br>
<p>
Respectfully,<br>
Arjen<br>
