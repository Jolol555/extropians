Actually genetic diversity has rather little to do with what you<br>
breathe and eat.  What you eat almost certainly comes from farms,<br>
and they don't need genetic diversity to operate.  Maintaining<br>
diversity would probably permit improvements to farming in the<br>
future, but it's not necessary.  The oxygen you breathe effectively<br>
comes from whatever plants fixed the carbon in the food you eat<br>
- in other words, the same farm plants.<br>
<p>
The other chemical cycles on this planet like the nitrogen and<br>
sulfur cycles are run by bacteria, and they're doing fine.<br>
The ongoing loss of genetic diversity is quite the catastophe<br>
for non-domesticated life, but for humans and their symbiotes<br>
it's done no significant harm as yet.  Even the total conversion<br>
of Planet Earth to Farm Earth would only be a moderate and <br>
manageable problem.<br>
