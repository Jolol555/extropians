Tim Starr &lt;TimStarr@netcom.com&gt; asked me for corroboration of the <br>
proposition that J. Edgar Hoover was the most evil man in American history.<br>
<p>
<p>
Let's look at that:<br>
<p>
Stalin's and Beria's NKVD; Hitler's and Mueller's GESTAPO;  Hoover's FBI:<br>
<p>
All of these organizations of social control were similarly structured.<br>
<p>
The evils of the NKVD and the Gestapo require no introduction to <br>
libertarians.  Well, Hoover's FBI was America's Gestapo.<br>
<p>
The NKVD, the Gestapo and the FBI all combine omnipresent social control; <br>
ideological control; specialized policing functions;; and -- most <br>
dangerous of all -- counterespionage functions.<br>
<p>
The combination of counterespionage (NOT counterintelligence) and internal <br>
policing is extraordinarily hazardous to the survival of a free society.  <br>
Free societies are unpredictable; and are made up of unpredictable people <br>
who have their own aims and ideas. This is _anathema_ to the <br>
social-control mentality.<br>
<p>
<p>
We all see the world (quite literally) mediated through a perceptual and <br>
cognitive framework which is structured by our ideas about it.  A hungry <br>
man sees possible sources of food; a cold, wet man sees possible places of <br>
shelter; a frightened man sees possible threats.<br>
<p>
<p>
(As Popper says: It is often thought that we are bad -- perhaps even <br>
wicked; and we are also clever; and it is this combination of badness and <br>
cleverness that is at the root of humankind's problems.  As aginst this <br>
(says Popper): we are good (perhaps even too good): but we are also rather <br>
stupid.  And it is this combination of goodness and stupidity that <br>
underlies most of our problems.  This second view has the great advantage, <br>
that we know more about enlightening peoples' stupidity than we know about <br>
correcting their evil).<br>
<p>
<p>
A policeman sees potential offences and offenders everywhere.  A <br>
counterespionage man sees everything as a potential threat -- possibly <br>
something other than what it _appears_ to be (see 'The Wilderness of <br>
Mirrors' by David Martin or Ed Epstein's 'Deception' for an immersion <br>
course). This is exactly analogous to the occult Weltanschaung or <br>
World-View, and incorporates a Manichaean 'good-vs-evil' polarization; <br>
with the added twist that fair can always be 'really' foul, and foul can <br>
always be 'really' fair.<br>
<p>
This is profoundly corrupting and perilous psychological territory.  Many <br>
counterespionagw controllers reckon that three or four years is about all <br>
that anyone can handle before their thinking becomes pervaded by a <br>
paranoid 'sick-think.'<br>
<p>
Worse: the counterespionage chief practices deception all the time, which <br>
is _morally_ hazardous.<br>
<p>
Worse still:  all internal-security chiefs end up thinking that they know <br>
best what is going on in society, _and what is best for other people_. <br>
They cannot explain _why_ they know better, because "it's a secret" -- and <br>
because their world-view is so at variance with everyday reality that <br>
'no-one will understand us anyway.'  <br>
<p>
(Compare and contrast: James Jesus Angleton (CIA _Counterintelligence_ <br>
chief) spent four hours one day explaining his version of 'the big <br>
picture' to Bill Colby (DCI); and Colby said afterwards that he simply <br>
couldn't even _understand_ it, never mind accept or reject it.  Bill Colby <br>
was really bright (and well-versed in covert operations)).<br>
<p>
<p>
Worst of all: because they see the worst elements in society, and then, in <br>
the worst possible light, they see society as under mortal and multiple <br>
sustained _threats;  and they are the only ones who stand between an <br>
egshell-like 'normality' and horrifying chaos.  They then justify what <br>
they're doing (i.e. anything) by saying:  "We do this so that ordinary, <br>
decent people can sleep safely in their beds at night" (John le Carre).<br>
<p>
Like the people at Waco?<br>
<p>
Ask yourself what sort of person is drawn into this sort of vocation.<br>
<p>
<p>
Hoover may well have started by doing some good work, and with the best of <br>
intentions.  But so did Heinrich Mueller (from his own point of view). <br>
However, he became aware of the extraordinary powers conferred by being <br>
the President's eyes and ears.  Then, the files on politicians -- full of <br>
all those incriminating and salacious tit-bits -- steadily built up. <br>
Hoover was soon 'hooked' on hard-core political pornography (including <br>
'kiddie-porn' -- 90% of U.S. 'kiddie-porn' is under FBI or State control).<br>
<p>
<p>
Hoover's intelligence-gathering ambitions steadily extended, first to <br>
Latin America, then -- megalomaniacally -- to the _entire world_.  He <br>
fought tooth-and-nail to get CIA strangled at birth, as a potential rival, <br>
and as a threat to his monopoly of information. (See 'The Wedge' on the <br>
CIA-FBI wars). Clearly, if he had been able to monopolize <br>
intelligence-gathering, analysis, reporting (including via a vast network <br>
of servile media assests), political blackmail and entrapment, and <br>
policing powers, he would be the diametric opposite of everything the <br>
Framers of the Constitution sought for a free society.  He directly <br>
abrogated the Separation of Powers.  In actuality, for most significant <br>
purposes, he _directly controlled_ the United States (including via <br>
servile political proxies like McCarthy and Nixon).<br>
<p>
<p>
Hoover openly boasted that he owned and controlled the Communist Party of <br>
the United States of America.  50% of CPUSA members were agents or <br>
informers.  That didn't stop him using it to orchestrate vast 'Red Scares' <br>
(see i.e David Caute, 'The Great Fear'), so as to gain extra illicit <br>
powers for himself and the State he also owned and controlled.  Perhaps <br>
this is why he wanted Japanese-Americans remaining at large -- to whip up <br>
'Yellow Peril' scares.  If you read Hoover's -- aptly-named -- book 'the <br>
Masters of Deceit', it's clear that he hates communism for all its <br>
democratic and libertarian bits, not the 'social-control' aspect.<br>
<p>
<p>
Hoover _organized_ 'Organized Crime', which can only survive with <br>
State-conferred approval -- approval that only Hoover could confer.<br>
<p>
Hoover operated the -- clever -- 'no-empty-rooms' scheme, whereby _every_ <br>
significant alternative political niche was colonized by the FBI.  Then, <br>
in the second stage, Hoover spread this fact about -- the <br>
'agent-behind-every-mailbox' tactic -- so as to to disillusion and <br>
dispirit actual and potential political activists, and make organized <br>
political resistance appear to be _impossible_<br>
<p>
<p>
And no-one _dared_ openly to defy him, because he could ruin their life, <br>
and/or murder or otherwise destroy people.  As he -- very publicly -- <br>
murdered the Kennedys.  And Martin Luther King. And Jean Seberg.  And <br>
_hundreds_ of other radical political activists and intellectuals -- an <br>
official serial-kiling spree that only slowed and near-stopped when Hoover <br>
died of old age (or whatever).<br>
<p>
The extended authoritarian extreme-Right subculture of social control <br>
freaks that Hoover spawned and bred _still_ plagues America (and American <br>
'law-enforcement'; and American politics -- especially Republican <br>
politics; and the media).<br>
<p>
<p>
    Can anyone point to anyone more evil in America's entire history?<br>
<p>
    And who did more to destroy the Constitution?<br>
<p>
    And whose authoritarianism nearly cost us the Battle for the World?<br>
<p>
<p>
    Judge William Webster was no libertarian.  Yet his first act as FBI <br>
    Director was to seize the bust of Hoover its prominent place in the J. <br>
    Edgar Hoover Building's  Reception Area, take it out into the street, <br>
    and contemptuously hurl it into the gutter.<br>
<p>
    It's about time we did the same with Hoover's entire grotesque and <br>
    morally filthy social-control legacy.  Janet Reno please note!<br>
