<i>&gt;3. ANOTHER VIEW OF THE SWISS GENE TECHNOLOGY REFERENDUM</i><br>
<i>&gt;F. Cavalli (Ospidale San Giovanni Bellinzona, CH), a member of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Swiss Parliament, in a letter to the journal Science,</i><br>
<i>&gt;responds to the recent editorial by Nobel Laureate Rolf M.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Zinkernagel concerning the coming Swiss referendum on a</i><br>
<i>&gt;constitutional prohibition of gene manipulation. Cavalli suggests</i><br>
<i>&gt;that Zinkernagel and others have made an erroneous assessment of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the current situation in Switzerland, and that there is distrust</i><br>
<i>&gt;throughout Europe "of giant companies whose solicitude for their</i><br>
<i>&gt;shareholders appears to outweigh their concern for their</i><br>
<i>&gt;thousands of workers."QY: Franco Cavalli, Ospidale San Giovanni,</i><br>
<i>&gt;6500 Bellinzona, CH (Science 9 Jan 98)</i><br>
<i>&gt;-------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;Related Background:</i><br>
<i>&gt;ON THE SWISS CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION OF GENE MANIPULATION</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is an interesting science policy development brewing in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Switzerland. A policy formulation called the Gene Protection</i><br>
<i>&gt;Initiative has come into existence, and it will be voted on in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;national referendum in 1998. This initiative, if approved by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;public referendum, will result in a constitutional prohibition of</i><br>
<i>&gt;gene manipulation, prohibition of the use and patenting of gene-</i><br>
<i>&gt;modified animals (including worms and flies), and prohibition of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the cultivation of gene-modified plants. The Swiss scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;community says that if the referendum is passed it will cause the</i><br>
<i>&gt;end of Swiss biotechnology and molecular biology. Both houses of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Swiss parliament have voted against the Initiative, agreeing</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the scientists and the Swiss industrial biotechnology</i><br>
<i>&gt;community that passing the referendum will produce a disaster. At</i><br>
<i>&gt;the present time it is not clear how the public will vote. Those</i><br>
<i>&gt;supporting the initiative claim that gene-modified plants cause</i><br>
<i>&gt;allergies, that science is one step away from the creation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;super-monsters, that scientists lack ethics, morals, and a sense</i><br>
<i>&gt;of responsibility, and that scientists have let the public down</i><br>
<i>&gt;on too many occasions. So they say gene technology must be banned</i><br>
<i>&gt;from Switzerland, and they hope the rest of the world will follow</i><br>
<i>&gt;suit. In an editorial in the journal Science, Rolf M. Zinkernagel</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Institute for Experimental Immunology, Univ. of Zurich, CH) is</i><br>
<i>&gt;optimistic that the good sense of the Swiss public will prevail</i><br>
<i>&gt;and that the Gene Protection Initiative will be defeated in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;referendum, but he points out that scientists must play their</i><br>
<i>&gt;part in dispelling the negative image of science and scientists,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and they must educate the public concerning the beneficial</i><br>
<i>&gt;applications of modern science. (Science 14 Nov 97)</i><br>
<i>&gt;-------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;MOVEMENTS IN UK AND EU TO BAN TRANSGENIC ANIMAL RESEARCH</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are movements underway in Britain and Europe to ban or</i><br>
<i>&gt;rigidly control the use of transgenic animals in biological</i><br>
<i>&gt;research. In the UK there are calls for a commission of inquiry</i><br>
<i>&gt;to investigate the welfare of transgenic animals. A recent survey</i><br>
<i>&gt;supported by the European Commission into public attitudes to</i><br>
<i>&gt;biotechnology evidently showed most respondents in EU countries</i><br>
<i>&gt;consider the creation of transgenic animals for research and for</i><br>
<i>&gt;organ transplantation to be morally unacceptable. In Switzerland,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Swiss scientists have issued a warning that biomedical research</i><br>
<i>&gt;in universities will be seriously harmed if a referendum to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;held next year to restrict genetic engineering (including a ban</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the use of transgenic animals) wins approval. An irony is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;surveys in Switzerland have shown that although three-quarters of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the population is against field trials of genetically modified</i><br>
<i>&gt;organisms, novel food, and cloning, a majority are in favor of</i><br>
<i>&gt;medical applications of technology. The apparent view of most</i><br>
<i>&gt;biologists about this matter is not complicated. The feeling</i><br>
<i>&gt;among biologists is that after centuries of arduous struggle by</i><br>
<i>&gt;thousands of biological researchers to understand fundamental</i><br>
<i>&gt;principles and apply them in medicine to alleviate suffering and</i><br>
<i>&gt;extend life, we are now, at the end of the 20th century, at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;threshold of the most important applications of basic biological</i><br>
<i>&gt;science to human health and the control of human disease. Genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;engineering and the use of transgenic animals are absolutely</i><br>
<i>&gt;essential to extend molecular biology and apply it expeditiously</i><br>
<i>&gt;to human clinical medicine. It is indeed ironic that the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;people who call for a halt to transgenic animal research expect</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ultimate in scientific expertise when they or their children</i><br>
<i>&gt;are victims of disease or other biological misfortunes. It is sad</i><br>
<i>&gt;to have a public uneducated about these matters; it is even</i><br>
<i>&gt;sadder that many politicians deem it wisdom to follow the public</i><br>
<i>&gt;mood rather than lead it. (Nature 24 Jul 97)</i><br>
