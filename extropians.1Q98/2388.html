I doubt that the "subjective 'I'" is bounded at the<br>
quark level &lt;sneeze - oops, there goes part of<br>
myself!&gt;  In any case, this "something" is called<br>
organizational or semantic closure (cf. anything on<br>
autopoiesis).<br>
<p>
Also, Barry Smith's "Social Objects" paper<br>
(<a href="http://wings.buffalo.edu/philosophy/ontology/socobj.htm">http://wings.buffalo.edu/philosophy/ontology/socobj.htm</a>),<br>
for example, develops the following basic<br>
bicategorical ontology:<br>
<p>
&lt; Continuants take up space and have spatial parts.<br>
Occurrents such as blushes, funeral marches, forest<br>
fires, too, may be spatially extended, but the<br>
spatial extendedness and spatial locatedness of<br>
occurrents in common-sense reality is in every case<br>
parasitic upon the extendedness and locatedness of<br>
the continuants which are their bearers.  A<br>
continuant is self-identical from the beginning to<br>
the end of its existence. &gt;<br>
<p>
Yes, I know, I am structurally coupled with the rest<br>
of the world - breathing, eating, communicating, etc.<br>
- and could not exist without that which is not-I.<br>
Still, if I cut my skin, I will heal it. However, if<br>
I cut your skin, you will have to heal yourself (even<br>
if you sue me and I end up paying for it ;-)<br>
