<p>
&lt;&lt;The real question is:  Why is there something, instead of nothing?<br>
<p>
I don't think that question has been answered satisfactorily yet.  My<br>
answer is that "nothing" doesn't exist, so "something" is the only other<br>
option.  But that is just playing with words and doesn't really answer<br>
the question.  Why does anything exist?  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
   Governments and religions play to the fear inherent in your tendency<br>
to ask this question in order to control you. Their "answers to life" sound<br>
good but essentially they are a hodge-podge of stolen concepts(see<br>
_Introduction<br>
to Objectivist Epistemology_ by Ayn Rand to see how people distort<br>
language with "stolen concepts").<br>
   The Universe is eternal. I recommend <a href="http://www.neo-tech.com">http://www.neo-tech.com</a>, Eric J.<br>
Lerner's book _The Big Bang Never Happened_, and the philosophy of<br>
Objectivism to explain why the question "Why does anything exist?" should<br>
never be asked because it can never be answered. (In regard to Objectivism<br>
I am concerned here only with the axioms--I don't "believe" every word<br>
that Ayn Rand has written during the totality of her career.)<br>
   Good luck!(I know my posts sometimes sound bitter[anger is a wonderful <br>
energy when used properly] but I am being sincere.)<br>
