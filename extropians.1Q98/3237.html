The following article recently appeared under the<br>
headline: "STUDY FINDS INITIALS COULD INFLUENCE<br>
WHEN PEOPLE R.I.P."<br>
<p>
Associated Press<br>
<p>
	"The argument is that there's some<br>
	psychological symbolic factor that<br>
	can exert its impact cumulatively<br>
	over the years."<br>
	-- Nicholas Christenfeld, Psychologist<br>
<p>
NEW ORLEANS - Maybe names really will hurt you. People with<br>
initials such as ACE or GOD are likely to live longer than<br>
those whose names spell out words like APE, DUD, RAT or PIG,<br>
a study suggests.<br>
<p>
The study, conducted by researchers from the University<br>
of California at San Diego, looked at 27 years' worth of<br>
California death certificates.<br>
<p>
People with monograms such as JOY or WOW had a better chance<br>
of living longer -- and were less likely to commit suicide or<br>
die in an accident -- than those with neutral or meaningless<br>
initials such as JAY or WLW, or those named, say, BUM or UGH,<br>
said psychologist Nicholas Christenfeld.<br>
<p>
He presented his findings Friday at a meeting in New Orleans<br>
of the Society of Behavioral Medicine.<br>
<p>
"The argument is that there's some psychological symbolic<br>
factor that can exert its impact cumulatively over the<br>
years. You get teased at school, wonder what your parents<br>
thought of you -- maybe fate is out to get you -- but<br>
at every stage it's a little tiny depressant to be called<br>
PIG, or a little tiny boost to your esteem to be called<br>
ACE or WOW," he said in an interview. "All we can do is<br>
look at the final outcome."<br>
<p>
The findings do seem to support the idea that liking your<br>
name and liking yourself may be linked, and that parents<br>
should be sensitive when naming children, said Penelope<br>
Wasson Dralle, a professor in LSU Medical Center's<br>
psychiatry department.<br>
<p>
"If people tend to look at your name and look up at you<br>
and laugh, you're sort of at a disadvantage," she said.<br>
But, she warned, the study "really doesn't glve us any<br>
cause and effects."<br>
<p>
The study looked at the 5 million or so people who died<br>
in California from 1969 through 1997.<br>
<p>
Concentrating on men because marriage generally doesn't<br>
change their initials, the researchers found 2,287 men<br>
with initials that were deemed plainly negative, such<br>
as ILL or DED. An additional 1,200 spelled or came close<br>
to words considered indisputably positive: WIN and VIP,<br>
for example. The researchers found 11 "good" sets of<br>
initials, and 19 "bad" ones.<br>
<p>
"Neutral" words and those that had both bad and good<br>
meanings were tossed from the list. So DAM and WET<br>
didn't make it. Nor did RAY and SUN.<br>
<p>
All in all, men with WINning initials lived 4.48 years<br>
longer than a control group of people with neutral or<br>
ambiguous monograms, while DUDs, ASSes and such died<br>
an average of 2.8 years earlier than a control group.<br>
<p>
The researchers did not compare the good and bad groups<br>
directly, instead comparing each to separate control<br>
groups.<br>
<p>
Six suicides were reported among the 1,200 men in the<br>
good group, vs. 79 among the 2,287 men in the bad group.<br>
That works out to half a percent vs. 3.5 percent. There<br>
were 31 accidental deaths -- 2.5 percent -- in the good<br>
group vs. 138, or 6 percent, in the bad group.<br>
<p>
"The notion being that accidents aren't really accidents<br>
-- whether deliberate or not, if you think less of yourself,<br>
you may be more likely to drive your car into a bridge<br>
abutment," Christenfeld said.<br>
