Actually, Brazil has been in an excellent position to leap to great power<br>
status for a long time. They have occasionally had a more powerful navy<br>
than the Soviet Union did at the height of its power. They have an<br>
excellent resource base, and are almost as large in area as the US (bigger<br>
if you don't count Alaska). What has held them back is the aristocratic<br>
plantation system that ruled for so long there (you will note that the<br>
similar system in the Southern US likewise had a similar retardent effect<br>
on industrial development)<br>
