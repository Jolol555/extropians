I think this definition is a good step towards understanding free will.<br>
In particular, it helps address the question of whether the fact that a<br>
system's behavior is predictable from outside, or simply deterministic,<br>
means that it does not have free will.<br>
<p>
However by itself the definition is too simple.  There has to be a<br>
specification of some minimum predictive ability, otherwise the definition<br>
is satisfied vacuously by systems simply because they can't predict at<br>
all.  Cars, inclined planes, and knives all appear to have free will by<br>
this definition, because they can not predict what they will do in the<br>
future.<br>
<p>
One possibility would be simply to add that the system must be concious<br>
before we begin to address whether it has free will.  This would still<br>
leave the definition useful for the cases we are interested in, without<br>
having this distracting loophole.<br>
