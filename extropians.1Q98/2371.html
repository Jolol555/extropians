  IAN: OK, so you posit that because an identity is<br>
  unique it is separated and not connected to other<br>
  identities. While that is the prevailing case for <br>
  identity limitation, I can show that it is false:<br>
<p>
  Mr. Jones is uniquely short, indeed he is exactly <br>
  4 feet shorter (-4) than the next smallest adult, <br>
  Mr. Smith. So the numerical expression of the uni-<br>
  que identity attribute of Jones is -4, and from <br>
  where did Jones get his this attribute? Smith. <br>
<p>
  If the unique identity attribute of Jones comes <br>
  from relation to Smith, the claim that the unique<br>
  identity of Jones defines a separation between <br>
  Jones and Smith is inherently false.<br>
<p>
  So right there we have shown that unique identity <br>
  attributes * define * holistic unity, not deny it.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;You, Ian, cannot ever feel what I feel inside, nor can any experiment </i><br>

<p>
<p>
  IAN: True, but that limitation only defines a <br>
  limit on my nervous system, not my identity/self.<br>
  If the nerves to my right leg were cut, I could <br>
  never know how my "right leg feels inside," but <br>
  that does not impose a limit on that which is <br>
  properly defined as myself, i.e., my numb leg <br>
  is still properly defined as a part of Ian.<br>
<p>
  Therefore, the fact that you are a numb part<br>
  of me, relative to me, as I am to you, does<br>
  not mean that we fall outside the proper<br>
  defitnions of who each of us are, and<br>
  thus ID "seperation" is a fallacy.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is a boundary between "I" and the rest of the universe, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and this boundary is definite, not indefinite. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: I think we just ran out of "definite."<br>
  The two cases for identity separation and <br>
  limitation, 1. uniqueness and 2. nervous <br>
  system limits, have been deconstructed.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;There really is something that gives coherency to the subjective </i><br>
<i>&gt;"I" and that something constructs a boundary between one quark</i><br>
<i>&gt;or bit of substance and the quark immediately next to it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: What is this "something."<br>
