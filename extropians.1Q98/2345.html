<i>&gt; I think some of the motivation for the debate comes from an attitude</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is not often stated but underlies the hostility towards artistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; endeavors.  It can be expressed baldly as:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The discovery of penicillin has done more to increase the sum total of</i><br>
<i>&gt;   human happiness than all of the great literature, paintings, and other</i><br>
<i>&gt;   forms of art, combined.</i><br>
<p>
The problems with this construction are many; even if one concedes<br>
some truth to it.<br>
<p>
(1) It ignores comparative advantage.  Van Gogh and Fleming are<br>
  very different people, with different abilities, influences,<br>
  desires, and ideas.  It serves all of us well that each was<br>
  able to push his unique talents to their limit.  If Van Gogh<br>
  had abandoned art for medicine, he would never have discovered<br>
  anything like Penicillin--he just wasn't suited for that--<br>
  but the world would have lost what he did create.<br>
<p>
(2) It ignores the hard-to-measure but very real influence of<br>
  inspiration to scientists.  I, for example, have chosen the<br>
  science path because I am well suited for it.  But I realize<br>
  that the projects I choose, the methods I employ, the ideas<br>
  I study, were all influenced by /all/ of my life experience,<br>
  much of which involves art.  My early pacifism, later modified<br>
  into libertarianism, I can attribute in no small part to<br>
  being profoundly moved by Picasso's /Guernica/; and that has<br>
  certainly influenced my scientific work as well.  How many<br>
  other scientists are inspired by Sci-Fi in various forms?<br>
<p>
(3) Who gives a damn about the "sum total" of human happiness?<br>
  I exist for /my/ individual happiness, and nothing else.<br>
<p>
(4) Mental exercise increases brain function, and Shakespeare is<br>
  no less a mental exercise than Newton.  Indeed, it is literature<br>
  and art that expand the boundaries of what we can imagine--and<br>
  later produce--with science.<br>
<p>
I'm sure there are others.<br>
