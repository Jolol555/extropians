<i> &gt; Let's recap _that_</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; 'The vast majority of people would be worthless to the first post-Humans'</i><br>
<p>
The first postbiological entity, whether ex-mehum or a ALife Golem, will<br>
be very soon (&lt;&lt;1 Year scale) a god relatively to the average person, <br>
only a few assumptions like strong AI, natural selection and a couple of things<br>
like nanoelectronics and molecular manufacturing assuming. It will run<br>
into saturation zone due to physical limits quite soon, but we nor our systems<br>
are not nigh any such limits. There is a _long_ way to go<br>
yet. Probably not temporally, but developmentally, certainly.<br>
<p>
What this new thing will or will not do we cannot know.<br>
<p>
Having said that, if natural selection at super and subsystem level still<br>
holds, a neoecology should soon emerge, which will expand into all<br>
niches, creating them and restructuring our current habitat past<br>
recognizability in distinctly subgeological time scales. Unless the<br>
new players are nice enough not to step on ants, mehums will survive.<br>
Hence, if you happen to be still interested in these quaint, boring<br>
things as personal survival you might want not to remain a mehum for<br>
_very_ long. Indeed, it might be wise to try to keep up with the<br>
Joneses. A rat race, once again? Hey, at least you have a chance of<br>
being an _alive_ super-rat -- albeit only if amongst the winners.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I'll agree with that, as I stated before we are already seeing the</i><br>
<i> &gt; beginning of this trough advances in automation, IMHO this is one of the</i><br>
<i> &gt; great social problems of the near-future.</i><br>
<p>
Why, panem et circenses.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 'and would be wiped out'</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; The way this is stated makes it sound asif many extropians have accepted</i><br>
<i> &gt; this as a fact-accompli (well, that's how can be interpreted anyway). Have</i><br>
<i> &gt; you?</i><br>
 <br>
We don't know. As our personal survival is on stake, we better be<br>
bloody sure we find out asap, nicht wahr?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Now, please replace 'people' by, say, 'mentally-retarded persons'. To bring</i><br>
<i> &gt; this logic to todays society. Down-syndrome patients seem to be fairly</i><br>
<i> &gt; useless (from an economic standpoint anyway, as humans they can be great).</i><br>
<p>
You are not getting it. I will not terminate a retarded person, but my<br>
living room be better peachy-clean (yucky bacteria), and certainly<br>
roach-free. Ah, and these ants are also _very_ annoying. I am a very<br>
anal-retentive god, you see.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt; Need I say more?</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; I've always felt that the lenghts to which we go to protect and care for</i><br>
<i> &gt; the weaker members of the species was one of the key things that set humans</i><br>
<i> &gt; apart from animals (certainly one of the most admirable).</i><br>
<p>
1) Humans kill each other routinely 2) People commit holocausts on<br>
other species absentmindedly. (I don't mind this, mark, I'm glad to be <br>
the one at the top of the food chain).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I think we need to have a serious discussion about the possible</i><br>
<i> &gt; PR-consequences of statements like these. Maybe I should stay totally out</i><br>
<p>
In this gentleman's club, we gentlefolk only socialize before the<br>
fireplace. Vulgar, wordly views are best kept outside according to the <br>
statutes of the club.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; of it, being a guest on this list, but I really think this issue should be</i><br>
<i> &gt; adressed.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Respectfully,</i><br>
<i> &gt; Arjen</i><br>
 <br>
ciao,<br>
