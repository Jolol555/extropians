You may be right, although there's not much heroics in IT-consultancy ;-)<br>
I'll agree with you that in the long term work that improves efficiency<br>
will benefit everybody but that doesn't address the acute problems that<br>
people are facing now. The fact that I am not to blame for their existance<br>
makes no difference whatsoever. I realize this is irrational (and maybe<br>
even a bit selfish) but then so are most other motivators in life.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;It would be a sin for you to throw away</i><br>
<i> &gt;your skills to go playing in the third world unless that's actually</i><br>
<i> &gt;where your skills are;</i><br>
<p>
Maybe is I had greater medical skills or something...<br>
It's true that I can probably generate more added-value at home than<br>
somewhere in a 3rd world village but don't you ever feel you want to do<br>
something about it yourself? I do, and the knowledge that's its almost<br>
impossible to do something constructive can be frustrating.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;comparitive advantage will put people where</i><br>
<i> &gt;their skills make the most difference--and therefore, money.</i><br>
<p>
Problem here is that working as a consultant I can earn a pretty decent<br>
living in a comfortable way. Red Cross and such is most often volunteer<br>
work or, at best, paying much lower wages than what one could earn in the<br>
commercial sector. Apparently trying to build a school in Africa isn't<br>
rated very high, economicaly speaking, compared to work done for the Big Blue.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;If a</i><br>
<i> &gt;group like the Red Cross or the Peace Corps--staffed with people</i><br>
<i> &gt;who are well-suited to those tasks--wants to go there, that's great.</i><br>
<p>
I find it more than great, I find it admirable that doctors volunteer to<br>
work under harsh and dangerous conditions without pay simply because they<br>
feel 'this is the right thing to do' (call me old-fashioned if you like ;-).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;But as has been pointed out before, Michael Milken did far more to</i><br>
<i> &gt;abolish hunger and poverty in the world than Mother Theresa did.</i><br>
<p>
Possibly, they both did great things in their own way. Comparing them would<br>
be difficult at best (aside from the fact that I don't like connecting aid<br>
&amp; religion).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;There is not a more fundamentally moral or socially responsible act</i><br>
<i> &gt;than to earn profit in free trade.</i><br>
<p>
Where the definition of 'free trade' is the tricky part of course. Other<br>
than that I would agree.<br>
<p>
Interesting point is that while Holland spends something like 1% of it's<br>
GNP on non-military foreign aid there is a net cash flow from Africa to<br>
Holland. Most of it going to large banks that have lent billions to these<br>
countries and are cashing in on the interest. Most of this money ends up in<br>
the Dutch economy somewhere. Africa is still very good to us.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I believe there is, however, another responsibility that sometimes</i><br>
<i> &gt;is overlooked: to actively resist, to the extent of one's ability,</i><br>
<i> &gt;those forces opposed to the values of life. I vote, for example,</i><br>
<i> &gt;because if I did not, I would feel some moral complicity in whatever</i><br>
<i> &gt;atrocities are committed by the government I failed to vote against.</i><br>
<p>
I agree. We just had county-level elections over here last wednesday and<br>
since I'm not that aware of local politics (they don't influence me that<br>
much) I was unsure what to vote for. But as Heinlein stated: "Even is there<br>
is no-one you'll want to vote for, there will always be people you'll want<br>
to vote against.".<br>
Another fine day for democracy ;-)<br>
