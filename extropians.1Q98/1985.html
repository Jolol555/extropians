I interpret "young in mind" as being open-minded and memetically malleable.<br>
Aged people are generally not young in mind.  This is not because they are not<br>
young in body though.  I do not see any basis for correlating a person's<br>
open-mindedness<br>
to their apparent physiological age.  A correlation does appear to exist because<br>
of the way our bodies age but in an age of immortality, that correlation would<br>
no<br>
longer be present.<br>
<p>
My concern was what would be the effect on society and the pace at which new<br>
ideas are<br>
adopted by society if there were extremely ancient (not in body) individuals<br>
walking about?<br>
Progress has often come when some particularly strong leader or group has died<br>
out.  That<br>
may no longer be an option in a future where people could be immortal.  Think<br>
of the advantage<br>
someone who has had a thousand years to establish contacts, networks, and a<br>
power base<br>
would have over someone just arriving on the "scene".   Imagine if someone like<br>
Lenin or Stalin<br>
or Roosevelt or Genghis Khan had been immortal?  What effect would that have on<br>
the course<br>
of history?  My first impulse is to say it would impede progress.  That may be<br>
oversimplifying the<br>
effects, but I think its an important issue to look at.<br>
