<i>&gt; Two messages illustrate the point I was trying to make about kneejerk</i><br>

<i>&gt; a person and determine whether they had commited a certain crime, without</i><br>
<i>&gt; revealing any other information about them.  He asked:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What legitimate reason could anybody</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have for not wanting the law enforcing agency scan his mind with this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; device in order to find out if he had commited a crime?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, look at it not as a threat to your freedom, but as a choice.</i><br>

Get thee behind me satan....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As I wrote, imagine two societies, one where people voluntarily agree</i><br>
<i>&gt; to submit to these scans, and another where they don't.  (There could</i><br>
<i>&gt; be other cases, such as societies where people agree that they will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; scanned only if a court finds probable cause that they may have commited</i><br>
<i>&gt; the crime.)  Which one will you prefer to live in?  Will you voluntarily</i><br>
<i>&gt; agree to be scanned in this limited and specific way, knowing that by</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing so you will live in a world in which virtually all criminals are</i><br>
<i>&gt; caught, and hence that the crime rate is very low?  Much of the time and</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort you spend protecting yourself today could be saved, at the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; losing this part of your privacy.  Some people will accept the tradeoff,</i><br>
<i>&gt; while others won't.</i><br>
<p>
"A nation which would surrender some freedoms for some measure of<br>
security shall wind up with neither." - Benjamin Franklin<br>
<p>
Yes, 1930's Germany traded freedoms for security from their paranoid<br>
fears of jewish conspirators, and Russians from 1917 on traded their<br>
freedom in its entirety for a greater measure of economic security, and<br>
look what it got them, and the entire world for that matter. No thank<br>
you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The point is, by viewing Nick's proposal as a threat to rights and</i><br>
<i>&gt; protections you have today, you avoid the hard part of the question.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's a knee jerk response.  Fifth amendment, legal protections, forcing</i><br>
<i>&gt; people to submit is wrong.  Fine, we can all agree about that.  But the</i><br>
<i>&gt; question is still there.  If it were done voluntarily as I described,</i><br>
<i>&gt; so that everyone involved was informed and everyone had agreed to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; conventions that would be followed, there are no legal problems and</i><br>
<i>&gt; no use of force or coercion.  Look at it beyond a shallow libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; analysis and you have to grapple with a much harder problem.</i><br>
<p>
Of course you can't ever get 100% of the people to agree on anything,<br>
even something as simple as what kind of pizza to order, so you are left<br>
with forcing somebody to involuntarily waive their rights, or you will<br>
wind up making those who exercise their right to not submit into instant<br>
social pariahs, since while the presumption of innnocence is the<br>
standard in the legal system, it is the opposite in society. If I refuse<br>
to be scanned then in the mind of society, I am already guilty,<br>
otherwise why would I refuse? This is the typical argument used to<br>
indirectly incriminate defendants and witnesses in courtrooms, no matter<br>
what the judge says, the jury will put weight to it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Personally, I am sensitive about my privacy, but I could see myself</i><br>
<i>&gt; agreeing to a rule that would allow scans under some circumstances.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would not want to be subject to routine scans every time there was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; purse snatched or someone scrawled graffiti on a wall, but if there were</i><br>
<i>&gt; some mechanism to establish a reasonable chance that I had commited a crime,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then I could accept it.  I'd expect that this would virtually never happen</i><br>
<i>&gt; and so it could be tolerable.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, a law with no teeth. SO you are talking about phantom security, not<br>
real security. Political puppeteering. Why waste the bandwidth???<br>
