LeTourneau's freedom restricted <br>
===============================<br>
<p>
<a href="mailto:nbar-new@seatimes.com">mailto:nbar-new@seatimes.com</a>  -- Nancy Bartley and Cheryl Harris<br>
<p>
Seattle Times staff reporters<br>
<p>
<p>
     She's traded the red jail coveralls worn by felons for street clothes <br>
     and her former cell at the Regional Justice Center for a residence on <br>
     a street of trim older homes near Seward Park.<br>
<p>
     With her 180-day jail sentence over, Mary Kay LeTourneau is free, <br>
     but not without restrictions. She now begins  a court-ordered, <br>
     three-year treatment program and must live with the label "sex <br>
     offender."<br>
<p>
     Yesterday, Seattle police assessed LeTourneau's "risk level," <br>
     according to state guidelines, and placed the former Highline <br>
     School District elementary-school teacher at Level 2, which means <br>
     she is considered  a moderate risk to reoffend.<br>
<p>
     Level 3 offenders are determined to be the most dangerous and <br>
     require police to hold community meetings to alert the public. <br>
     Level 1 offenders don't require any neighborhood notification.<br>
<p>
     Level 2 means police will distribute fliers with LeTourneau's <br>
     photo, crime information and her approximate address.<br>
<p>
     "This is a sensational neighborhood," said resident David Myre, <br>
     73, who wasn't worried about his new neighbor.<br>
     <br>
     "I don't see any problem," Myre said of LeTourneau. "I hope she's <br>
     rehabilitated."  But, he said, it's also important that she <br>
     especially be kept away from children for now.<br>
<p>
<p>
     But in a community with mom-and-pop stores and family <br>
     restaurants, where yellow school buses are as familiar sights as <br>
     the playgrounds that surround nearby neighborhoods, 38-year-old <br>
     Clay Borella understands why parents would worry about <br>
     LeTourneau's arrival.<br>
<p>
     "If I had kids, I would feel pretty strong about it one way or <br>
     the other," he said. ". . . I feel she made a pretty big <br>
     mistake."<br>
<p>
     That mistake swayed police to place her as a Level 2 offender.<br>
<p>
     "What put her over the top (to a Level 2 status) was that she was <br>
     in a position of trust," said Detective Bob Shilling.<br>
<p>
<p>
     Last August, LeTourneau pleaded guilty to raping a 13-year-old <br>
     former student, whom she had known since he was in her second-grade <br>
     class. King County Superior Court Judge Linda Lau sentenced her to 180 <br>
     days in jail and gave her a 7 1/2-year suspended sentence.<br>
     <br>
     The sentence provisions included having no contact with the boy - <br>
     whose baby she gave birth to last May - and enrolling in <br>
     sex-offender treatment under the state Special Sex Offender <br>
     Sentencing Alternative (SSOSA) program.<br>
<p>
     "SSOSA is an excellent program," said Dr. Gordon Arthur, director <br>
     of the sex-offenders treatment program at Twin Rivers <br>
     Correctional Center. "It serves the public very well. . . .  It <br>
     takes low-risk offenders and holds them responsible for their <br>
     behavior, while still ensuring they can still suport their families."<br>
<p>
     There are 130 sex-offender treatment providers listed under <br>
     SSOSA, and LeTourneau will begin therapy with a psychologist.<br>
<p>
     But, according to the provisions of the court order, LeTourneau's <br>
     therapy will be highly structured and every part of her life - <br>
     from her sex life to her work life, will be up for review by the <br>
     psychologist.<br>
<p>
     [NOTE: Mary Kay had to agree to be quizzed with a polygraph on <br>
     every sexual experience she'd ever had, to 'qualify' for SSOSA. <br>
     She  also had to write a hundred-page essay on her childhood and <br>
     all her early experiences for the state-licenced 'private-sector' <br>
     treatment provider. -- TH].<br>
<p>
     <br>
     Under Lau's guidelines, LeTourneau is required to:<br>
<p>
     --  Not date or have a relationship with anyone who has minor <br>
     children.<br>
<p>
     --  Disclose her "sexual deviancy" to potential sex partners and <br>
     inform the psychologist of any plans for sexual activity.<br>
<p>
     --  Bring her significant other to the treatment program's <br>
     therapy sessions.<br>
<p>
     --  Not become pregnant again.<br>
<p>
     --  Have no contact with the victim, or unsupervised contact with <br>
    her own four children by her estranged husband. She may have contact <br>
    with her baby.<br>
<p>
     --  Bring in her "support system" to meet her therapist.<br>
<p>
     --  Maintain employment or volunteer work and inform the <br>
     supervisor of her sexual-deviancy status.<br>
<p>
     --  _Pay for the treatment herself_ and any related counseling.<br>
<p>
<p>
     She also is required to take medication [Valproic Acid, which <br>
     directly attacks the frontal-lobe neural cascades which mediate <br>
     religious experience] and undergo therapy for a bipolar disorder, <br>
     which is a chemical condition of the brain that subjects its <br>
     sufferers to wild mood swings and erratic behavior.<br>
<p>
     At the end of her three-year program, LeTourneau is to report <br>
     back to the court for a hearing. Then, for the rest of her life, <br>
     she'll have to report her address to police, Shilling said.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     She's not alone. While female sex offenders are less common than <br>
     men, of the 1,065 registered sex offenders in Seattle, 17 are <br>
     female.<br>
