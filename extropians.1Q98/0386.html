<i>&gt; I doubt that efficient tiny reactors can be built. There are two</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibilities, one being cold fusion (which seems to be doubtful at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; moment) and the other is based on sonoluminescence (SL). SL is still a</i><br>
<i>&gt; macroscopic process but I could imagine a SL reactor in the kilogram</i><br>
<i>&gt; size range.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
nanotech is not magic. As 'gene says, it may not even be feasible. My<br>
guessitmate is that is feasible. The requirement for fusion is that<br>
atoms must slam into each other fast enough. The requirement for<br>
useful fusion is "engineering breakeven": The process must emit<br>
more useful energy with no external input. In the particular<br>
application we're discussing, the useful energy is low-intensity<br>
heat, which is the easiest goal to reach.<br>
<p>
It's not proven that SL is blackbody rediation and therefore<br>
indicative of near-fusion conditions, and the phenomenon is<br>
not well enough understood to find a useful set of conditions<br>
whereby you can extract useful energy: currently, SL is observed<br>
only at temperatured near the freezing point of water. Don't count<br>
on SL for micro-fusion. <br>
<p>
I envision an D-D fusion reactor based on a form of inertial-confinement<br>
fusion, using a truly tiny holraum and starting in an environment with<br>
very high static pressure. The environment is the center of a set of<br>
diamondoid spheres, each of which contributes a megapascal or so of<br>
pressure differential. The D-D reaction emits no primary neutrons.<br>
The innermost sphere brings the interior static pressure up to the<br>
highest level that remains consistent with diamondiod nanotech and<br>
diamondoid compressive and tensile strength. The nanotech machinery<br>
contained within the inner shell then delivers a transient implosive<br>
pulse to the holraum (mechanically, or with lasers, or with explosives)<br>
to cause fusion. This geherates a lot of heat, raising the temperature<br>
of th interior. The reactor uses the thermal gradient from inside to<br>
outside to capture the energy neeeded to drive the next pulse.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; OTOH, using nanotech for waste disposal, including body waste, for full</i><br>
<i>&gt; oxidation would provide quite a bit of energy and keep the campsite</i><br>
<i>&gt; clean too. The tent could be made of a kind of diamondoid foam with</i><br>
<i>&gt; vacuum within the foam (like a super aerogel) giving the tent a</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonable R value (15 or so) so staying warm in the tent would be easy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The nano could also collect the evaporated water (and its heat of</i><br>
<i>&gt; condensation stays in the tent). </i><br>
<p>
Agreed. Given nano, you can get very efficient in every way. In<br>
particular,<br>
forget the tent. Just reconfigure your body's resident clothing nanos to<br>
provide<br>
an insulating skin of the type you describe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Going nuclear seems a bit excessive for</i><br>
<i>&gt; this app which has many non nuke solutions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
This is valid, but only to a point. If you had resident body and<br>
clothing<br>
nanos, and you had a "mister fusion", then you would be totally<br>
self-contained.<br>
your nanos could recycle your body's wastes, including your exhaled air,<br>
to<br>
generate food, water and air. Your only requirement would be a place to<br>
dispose of excess heat.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  If, as you say, nanotech can permit complete recovery of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the dangerous isotopes generated</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; by neutron activation, then all that remains is deactivation of those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; same isotopes. This is also perfectly feasible, because these isotopes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can be exposed to still more fast neutrons by recycling them back into</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the fusion reactor. Most of atoms will eventually transform to stable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; isotopes under additional exposure to fast neutrons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, at least the early verions of nano will only be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinguish elements, not isotopes. Also, any nano working with</i><br>
<i>&gt; radioactive elements is subject to considerable damage. As for neutrons,</i><br>
<i>&gt; well, they are oblivious to nanotech, and will happily wander through</i><br>
<i>&gt; all kinds of matter. I surely wouldn't want a neutron emitting fusion</i><br>
<i>&gt; reactor in my tent!</i><br>
<p>
Some elements capture neutrons very efficiently, but I want to<br>
start with a reaction that doesn't emit neutrons at all. If we can do<br>
that<br>
the neutron flux will be very small, due only to incidental fusion when<br>
fast<br>
particles bash into the container walls.  I'm not sure, but I<br>
think you can pick structural elements so that the wastes that need to<br>
be separated<br>
are different elements: You don't have to recognize the isotope of<br>
nitrogen,<br>
you just have to remember that no nitrogen should be here. <br>
   <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The tiny percentage</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that do not can be separated (again by nanotech)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So, how do you catch these anyway??</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
That's not a percentage of neutrons, that's a percentage of waste atoms.<br>
you catch the atoms by recognizing that they are atoms of elements<br>
(heavy metals) that don't belong here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  and deactivated in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tiny</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; particle accellerator.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even nano accelerators will not be very efficient.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
It doesn't have to be efficient. It doesn't even have to<br>
break even. It just has to be able to bust up these ugly big<br>
radioactive isotopes that are not amenable to destruction by other<br>
means.<br>
The problem is that for esthetic and political reasons we want this<br>
tiny accelerator to be contained within the "mister fusion" housing.<br>
What I'm banking on here is a major deux ex machina, even worse than<br>
the inertial confinement system above: There are ways to use lasers<br>
to pump energy into a particle beam with extreme efficiency, yielding<br>
a very high change in Mev per meter of acelerator. I further assume that<br>
an accelerator built via nanotech to atomic precision can achieve the<br>
nearly the theoretical efficiency limit. This should permit each nasty<br>
heavy radioneucleotide atom to be bashed with extreme precision into<br>
little pieces that are more tractable, all (I hope) in an accelerator<br>
that's less than a meter long.<br>
