           <br>
<p>
Why not? When you find a person, computer, animal or machine that operates <br>
exceptionally well and is very good at coming up with new ideas, have your <br>
Nano robots take it apart atom by atom and record the position and velocity <br>
of every particle. With this information you can make as many persons, <br>
computers, animals or machines as you like, and all of them will have the<br>
intelligence, experience, and understanding of the world that you admired so <br>
much in the original. Creativity would be a commodity you could crank out by <br>
the ton.      <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;it appears, we will also never have enough of: respect.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Respect is just a matter of altering a mental state, we've been doing <br>
that sort of thing in a crude way for thousands of years even without <br>
Nanotechnology, all we needed was a little alcohol. Think my ideas are <br>
dreadful if not comically stupid? No problem! In an age of Nanotechnology  <br>
you can always change your mind, and I do mean, CHANGE YOUR MIND. <br>
Now you think my ideas are wonderful and look at me with awe.<br>
