Our last meeting of the Extropian Investment Group was really helpful during<br>
this time of ups and downs.  Rather than go over details of the meeting,<br>
I'll pitch to Extropy Online to cover the meetings so that everyone can gain<br>
some wisdom form how some experts are dealing with it as well as those of us<br>
who are learning the ropes (or should I say bulls and bears -:)<br>
<p>
I had a funny thought yesterday after hearing about the market's morning<br>
lows and afternoon highs (relevant): I can see the traders rising at the<br>
crack of dawn running in their p'jamas to computer terminals, phone lines<br>
and tv programs to check out the Asian market. Then, after the usual bad<br>
news and selling off what they can, in mobs they head for the corner bar for<br>
several hours, until they, after a few martinis, build up enough courage to<br>
rush back and buy what they can by the close of the day.<br>
