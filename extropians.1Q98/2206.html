=============== Introduction  =======================<br>
<p>
The following announcement has been send to me through one of the<br>
(L)egalize!-Mailing-Lists. Personally, I consider the drug-war a perfect<br>
example of how "terrocrats" try to force a certain behaviour on people -<br>
allowing certain (mind-numbing) drugs and declaring war on others (that<br>
is: war on the people using those other drugs).<br>
<p>
Besides, in order to justify this war (which is basically just a big<br>
waste of money), research is done with weird motives:<br>
In Germany, for example, only research trying to show harm of (illegal)<br>
drugs is supported by the "government" (and due to the drug-war there's<br>
not much economic interest in that kind of research unless you belong to<br>
the mafia). If such research reveals postive effects those drugs may<br>
have - or even less negative effects than<br>
expected, it may not even get published (such a case just happened<br>
recently with a study on marijuana). Personally, I think this looks very<br>
much like an (successful) attempt of utilizing science for propaganda -<br>
making *serious* research extremely hard.<br>
<p>
A more rational drug-policy may help making a more rational drug-science<br>
a lot easier!<br>
<p>
later,<br>

       The 1998 Global Days against the Drug War !<br>

                 Join the Coalition !<br>
<p>
As you probably know, the United Nations will hold the first-ever<br>
Special Session of the General Assembly on Drugs, from June 8th<br>
to June 10th 1998 in New York.<br>
<p>
This session was originally conceived as a critical examination<br>
of worldwide anti-drug policy. The focus of this session has<br>
now been narrowed. According to the new guidelines, only the<br>
expansion of existing policies will be open for discussion. The<br>
United Nations aims to escalate current drug repression tactics<br>
in a catastrophic quest towards a 'drug free' society. In terms<br>
of crime, economic and financial damage, and social and personal<br>
harm, this policy is turning into a worldwide crisis!<br>
<p>
It is of great importance that alternative proposals are heard<br>
at the onset of this UN session. A clear statement must be made<br>
that what is needed is not escalated repression, but reform<br>
policies aimed at reducing the damage currently done.<br>
<p>
To this aim, a number of organisations have recently united to<br>
form the "Global Coalition for Alternatives to the Drug War".<br>
They have written a declaration that will be published widely.<br>
You can join the coalition by co-signing the declaration; see<br>
the contact info below.<br>
<p>
Members of this coalition are also invited to participate in the<br>
"1998 Global Days against the Drug War", which are held Saturday<br>
June 6th, Sunday June 7th, and Monday June 8th. This international<br>
event will feature discussion forums, seminars, publications, <br>
press conferences, demonstrations, street parties, concerts, and<br>
other types of events, in many places at the same time. At this<br>
moment (February 17th), eleven events have already been announced!<br>
A 'grand finale' is planned to take place in New York on Monday 8th.<br>
<p>
You can help make the 1998 Global Days against the Drug War<br>
a success! Make sure your city is part of this event. If you<br>
are a member of a group or organisation that can help, contact<br>
us. Otherwise, you can join one or more of the participating<br>
groups and organisations, or set up your own group. See<br>
the contact info below.<br>
<p>
Early spring of 1998 we will issue press releases with the names<br>
of all the groups and organisations that have joined the coalition.<br>
Groups and organisations are invited to plan their own version<br>
of the 1998 Global Days against the Drug War, under their own<br>
identity and name. Note however that participation in the coali-<br>
tion does not itself imply endorsement of the individual events<br>
taking place.<br>
<p>
Organisations wishing to join the coalition can send mail to<br>
alliance@legalize.org. Individual activists please visit the<br>
web site at <a href="http://www.legalize.org">http://www.legalize.org</a>.<br>
<p>
The Coalition for Alternatives to the Drug War currently consists of:<br>
<p>
The Drug Reform Coordination Network (DRCNet), the National Orga-<br>
nisation for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), Coordina-<br>
zione Radicale Antiprohibizionista (CORA), the November Coalition,<br>
Transnational Radical Party (TRP), Common Sense for Drug Policy,<br>
the Legalize! Initiative, the Media Awareness Project (MAP),<br>
the Campaign for the Restoration and Regulation of Hemp (CRRH),<br>
HANF! Magazine, and other organisations.<br>
