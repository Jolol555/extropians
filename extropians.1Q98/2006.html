<p>
It is more-or-less, and also a lot easier to implement. It can also be a<br>
testbed for nonvirtual Extropia (which, for the record, I must consider a<br>
yet another (and powerfully distracting at that) dream). Me, I'd just be<br>
deliriously happy to survive the Singularity (i.e. having a continous<br>
trajectory in persona space thru the Singularity). Btw, is the current ad<br>
hoc Californian Extropians enclave not sufficient/is a natural segregation<br>
focus? (Anybody in residence over there care to relate your experiences?) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but you still live in the real world where you're pretty much at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mercy of the often whimsical government and "society". Furthermore,</i><br>
<p>
I think the idealist escapist in you makes you gloss over the rough edges<br>
far too easily. Unless a full-blown neoludd witchhunt is on (then<br>
presenting an easy target is definitely not a good idea), the interference<br>
of state can only be considered a minor (albeit definitely<br>
resource-draining) nuisance. Yeah, it's not pretty, but it won't hinder<br>
your plans enough to prevent the altogether. If yes, your plans may not<br>
have been that robust after all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; virtual networking is nice to chat and make initial contacts, but if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; *really* want to get something done you'll still need get togeter </i><br>
<p>
Does distributed project coordination, a focused newsfeed (time is money!) <br>
and digicash transfer strike a vein? The importance of _direct_ matter<br>
manipulation may be further diminished if we consider minimal telepresence<br>
capability expected to become available in the next two decades, or so. In<br>
any case you could purchase the services desired, albeit efficiency might<br>
suffer. Of course this is a just another sterile Geekonia dream. So sue<br>
me. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; IRL. Besides, a new nation is *adventure*, an energizing inspiration to</i><br>
<i>&gt; all, a great service (refuge from persecution) and a potential source</i><br>
<p>
Also, it is a great resource sink, and just an invitation to having you<br>
all conveniently extinguished (yes, chronic paranoia _can_ become a<br>
lifestyle). Btw, anybody having a wager when we will see the first<br>
(sub)tactical nuke use, and by whom? Similiar bets as to bioweapons'?. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; of considerable income (something this movement is in dire need of).</i><br>
<p>
Judging from the cryonics movement (at least two instances?) and<br>
Scientology dogma can be a great motivation for individual finance<br>
resource accretion. Being a personal success beakon will make extropy look<br>
like more than a yet another weird Californian cult. Imho. (And having ExI<br>
not permanently teetering at the edge of bankruptcy (feel free to correct<br>
me) should also help to increase the memefection rate somewhat). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Founding a new nation gives a sense of direction to transhumanism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and it's an useful drill for the next logical step: migration to space.</i><br>
<p>
By the time we are supposed to get hit by that fabled Singularity I'd<br>
expect only a few 10 k persons in (mostly, cislunar) space, if at all. A<br>
malignant Singularity will thus have an easy time to having your systems<br>
perverted, when looking for minimax paths into space. Autistic fugitives<br>
at the periphery ought to have a fairly good chance, though. Call me<br>
Ishmael<br>

Oh yes, and my augmented hamster is building a wormhole drive.<br>
