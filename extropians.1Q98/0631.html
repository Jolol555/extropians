<i> &gt;To an Extropian, this news is scary stuff. Note what Chirac says: he's not</i><br>
<i> &gt;just working on an international ban on human cloning, but on any genetic</i><br>
<i> &gt;alterations to human beings. Goodbye one path to posthumanity!</i><br>
<p>
Chirac has a big mouth but has made a great mess of his country and has<br>
lost the support of many French people, strikes, demonstrations and a<br>
capital that looks like an city under martial law (so much police). France<br>
is on a downhill slide both economicallly and politically. And Chirac is<br>
quicky losing the support of PM's like Bliar (UK) and Kok (Netherlands).<br>
There is hope ;-)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;PARIS (January 12, 1998 4:08 p.m. EST <a href="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</a>) -- Hours after</i><br>
<i> &gt;French President Jacques Chirac called for a world ban on human cloning, 19</i><br>
<i> &gt;European nations signed an agreement Monday to prohibit genetic replication</i><br>
<i> &gt;of humans.</i><br>
 //SNIP//<br>
<i> &gt;"It is on the international level that one must ban </i><br>
<p>
Sounds like the Fourth Protocol (the banning of nuke's, didn't work either)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The July 1997 presentation of Dolly the sheep, the world's first cloned</i><br>
<i> &gt;mammal, set off an international outcry over the implications for human</i><br>
<i> &gt;biology.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Many world leaders renewed their condemnation after Chicago scientist</i><br>
<i> &gt;Richard Seed said Jan. 7 that he planned to begin working on human cloning</i><br>
<i> &gt;using a new technique.</i><br>
<p>
Yes well, that was not a very smart move PR-wise. I didn't hear much in the<br>
media about the _applications_ of cloning. Just a lot of boys-from-brazil BS.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;"We would resolve nothing in banning certain practices in one country if</i><br>
<i> &gt;the doctors and researchers can develop them elsewhere," said Chirac,</i><br>
<i> &gt;citing the "worrying trend" in the United States.</i><br>
<p>
So research will continue in England, the Netherlands and other countries.<br>
No problem. Chirac slowed things down a bit, nothing more (don't get me<br>
wrong that;s bad enough but a solvable problem).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Representatives from 19 members of the Council of Europe later today signed</i><br>
<i> &gt;a protocol that would commit their countries to prohibiting by law "any</i><br>
<i> &gt;intervention seeking to create human beings genetically identical to</i><br>
<i> &gt;another human being, whether living or dead."</i><br>
<p>
Once cloning becomes a usefull technology in medicine and bio-industry this<br>
law will be softened, same as abortion and IVF (In Vitro Fertilization).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The 40-member group was founded in 1949 to promote democracy, human rights</i><br>
<i> &gt;and the rule of law.</i><br>
<p>
So they make laws that cannot possibly be enforced. Again, all this reminds<br>
me of all the failing druglaws. A law forbidding this kind of technology<br>
cannot possibly be enforced for a long time. I cannot think of any<br>
technology with clear applications that were economically feasible and/or<br>
socially desirable that were succesfully suppressed for long (if someone<br>
does, please speak-up ;-)<br>
<p>
In light of other technical/ethical debates held this century I'm not to<br>
worried about some French fossil trying to enforce his medieval view of<br>
ehtics on the global scientific and medical community.<br>
<p>
Abortion is legal, drugs are almost legal, IVF is legal, bio-tech on<br>
mice/sheep/cow's is legal. When it becomes a useful tool cloning will also<br>
be legal. Call me an optimist if you like ;-)<br>
<p>
