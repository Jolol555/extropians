<p>
1)   THE DEFENSE OF THE SPECIES<br>
<p>
1a)  Our species, HomoSapiens, arose from the stuff of beasts. Perhaps<br>
as little as a few<br>
     hundred thousand years ago.  Before that time the earth was<br>
populated with two or<br>
     maybe more species that had the potential to become what we are<br>
today.  Those other<br>
     proto-human species did not survive the fire of evolution.<br>
Perhaps we killed them,<br>
     perhaps they succumbed due to an unknown deficit or lack of<br>
resilience.  Nonetheless,<br>
     they are gone.  We will not go.  We are now endowed with tools<br>
that will overcome the<br>
     fire and enable us to change.  To change our environment and to<br>
change ourselves.<br>
<p>
1b)  We have the power to direct the next step in our evolution.  If<br>
we do not take initiative<br>
     and mold our future, nature will do it for us.  We are a loose<br>
cannon on the evolutionary<br>
     timetable, we have effectively stifled the mechanisms for change<br>
due to our social<br>
     behavior.  Therefore if left to it's own devices, Nature will<br>
destroy mankind.  It will<br>
     cleanse the earth of our menace and replace us with a less<br>
intelligent more predictable<br>
     docile creature.<br>
<p>
1c)  The path to intelligence that our species has taken is a road<br>
seldom traveled, it is only<br>
     available to a species under the direst circumstances.  When<br>
those circumstances of the<br>
     environment are such that it requires less effort to make a<br>
species intelligent that it does<br>
     to make them something else.  An extremely rare serendipity<br>
<p>
1d)  Now that we have this weapon, intelligence, we must use it in our<br>
defense.  Against the<br>
     forces of evolution that would destroy us.  We must weald the<br>
sword of intelligence in<br>
     defiance of the Luddite mentality that will inevitably arise in<br>
societies, religions and<br>
     governments as resistance to the new man.  We must use this tool<br>
to form a new<br>
     species.  We must mold our evolution to produce an altered man.<br>
One who improves<br>
     the best of the best of our attributes both physical and social.<br>
One that in turn will<br>
     continue the process of species improvement on it's own.<br>
<p>
2)   OUR BODIES<br>
<p>
2a)  HomoSapiens are ill equipped physically to maintain existence for<br>
very long.  We have<br>
     within our structure subsystems that are fragile, any of which<br>
have the potential to cause<br>
     our death.  <br>
<p>
2a1) Our respiratory system does double duty.  It is used to oxygenate<br>
our blood and enable<br>
     our verbal  communication.  We have no backup system in the event<br>
of failure.  Nature<br>
     has given us nothing to fall back on as a crutch to keep us going<br>
in the event of a minor<br>
     malfunction.  Respiratory distress is a major cause of death.  It<br>
only take a few moments<br>
     visiting hospital wards to realize that a solution must be found.<br>
Millions of people both<br>
     infant and aged suffer and strangle in their sickbeds gasping for<br>
a tiny breath.  One tiny<br>
     wheeze of oxygen to fill their lungs, when a better engineering<br>
job could heal them, and<br>
     send them on their way.  <br>
<p>
2a2) By combining these two uses, nature has given us a tripwire to<br>
our own destruction. <br>
     The path to our lungs is intersected with the path to our<br>
digestive systems. A deadly<br>
     combination.  Intelligence will  enable us to devise a<br>
technological solution.       <br>
     Mechanisms can be invented and installed that will provide<br>
oxygenation on a continuous<br>
     basis, thereby freeing us from this dangerous intersection.<br>
Others can be installed that<br>
     will control airflow over our vocal cords enabling us to speak.<br>
An improved man thus<br>
     altered will then become a master of many environments.  He can<br>
live and work in the<br>
     depths of the sea, and in the emptiness of space.  The limitation<br>
to our expansion into<br>
     these realms will then become a matter of pressure compensation,<br>
a problem we are<br>
     already able to technologically solve to a great extent. <br>
<p>
2a3) Our Renal system is also very fragile.  We already have in use<br>
huge devices that<br>
     inadequately filter toxins and excess fluids from our blood.  The<br>
technologies must be<br>
     improved to the point where one structure may be unintrusively<br>
installed in our bodies<br>
     with adequate backup making our Livers and Kidneys obsolete.<br>
Such an improved man<br>
     will no longer suffer and die from the myriad of minor events<br>
that currently kill millions<br>
     of people worldwide.<br>
<p>
2a4) We need more than one heart.  Perhaps as many as four that each<br>
have the ability to<br>
     maintain blood flow throughout our circulatory systems.  One for<br>
each lung and one for<br>
     each Femoral Artery in our legs.  Heart attacks will disappear,<br>
or become a minor<br>
     nuisance easily resolved.  Minor blockages will no longer be life<br>
threatening.  Our<br>
     bodies already have mechanisms to reroute blood vessels in the<br>
event of blockage.  The<br>
     altered man will now have time to let those new pathways grow on<br>
their own without<br>
     the threat of death in the interim.    <br>
<p>
2a5) With the invention of a workable nerve/mechanism interface we<br>
will be free from the<br>
     limitations of structure in our bodies as a whole.  A thus<br>
altered human will be essentially a<br>
     brain and spinal cord with life support structure.  Able to be<br>
plugged directly into<br>
     anything from a earthmoving machine to a spaceship.  Man at this<br>
point will be free to<br>
     roam any environment, and he will become the master of all.<br>
<p>
2a6) We carry with us evolutionary baggage.  Attributes both physical<br>
and social that<br>
     originated in that Odd Little Primate.  Evolution is a violent<br>
and bloody process, full of<br>
     stress and horror and gnashing of teeth.  Our bodies are built<br>
for fight or flight and not<br>
     suited to calm easy times.  Likewise our behavioral attributes<br>
are built for conflict.  We<br>
     Hate and Fear and Lust and are full of Self Pity because it comes<br>
naturally to us.  They<br>
     are the four basic instincts.  They are also attributes we should<br>
leave behind on our way<br>
     to the next evolutionary plateau.  <br>
<p>
2a7) Recognize them for what they are.  Keep watch on your emotions.  <br>
<p>
2a8) You will not succeed in mastering them, because they are<br>
ingrained in the structure of<br>
     your body.  Some control however is better than none.  In the<br>
millions of years to come<br>
     the creature that will evolve from us, may at long last be free<br>
of them.  There      <br>
     unfortunately is no guarantee that our species will survive to<br>
change.  We may be    <br>
     another of life's dead ends.  On the way we may also be destined<br>
for devolution, a return<br>
     to the wild, ignorant, savage, and Odd Little Primate.  Not the<br>
first species to cause its<br>
     own extinction.<br>
<p>
2a9) The decedents of that Odd Little Primate developed language.<br>
This miracle caused a<br>
     giant leap forward in our evolution.  A brain without language is<br>
a confused stewpot of<br>
     emotions, images, and instincts.  Without any structure<br>
consistent from one individual to<br>
     another.  It was as if the brain was a clean unformatted hard<br>
drive.  It had lots of storage<br>
     space, but no consistent way to retrieve data, and no method of<br>
recording anything<br>
     complex.  Language is the disk operating system of the brain.  It<br>
allows for consistent<br>
     retrieval of data by structuring the way each bit of information<br>
is stored.  It allows more<br>
     than one individual to share complex information.  It allows them<br>
to learn from each<br>
     other.<br>
<p>
3)   OURSELVES<br>
<p>
3a)  Faith is a commendable asset, only when it is based on truth.  It<br>
is described as the proof<br>
     of things unseen, the "I know that I know that I know."  Bad<br>
faith is one based on a<br>
     falsehood.  It is a set of beliefs that result in injury or<br>
limitation to the advancement of<br>
     the species.  Good faith is any set of beliefs that reinforce the<br>
species in it's quest for<br>
     truth.  <br>
<p>
3a1) I have faith that my children will be good people, yet I know<br>
that bad people come from<br>
     good loving parents sometimes, yet I believe.  I have seen my<br>
children mature from<br>
     infants to young men and women.  I have seen their tears, and<br>
their concern for people<br>
     other than themselves.  So I have faith and  am comforted by it.<br>
<p>
<p>
3a2) I have faith that science will search for the truth in all<br>
matters, yet I know that  <br>
     falsehoods sometimes become politically or financially expedient,<br>
yet I believe.  I know<br>
     that falsehoods eventually fall under the yoke of independent<br>
verification.  Vindication<br>
     will come to the truth.  Sometimes later than it should, but it<br>
always comes.  So I have<br>
     faith and am comforted by it.<br>
<p>
3b)  Humans have an almost infinite capacity for self delusion.  I<br>
know this to be true.  I<br>
     therefore have no faith in other peoples miracles, I only have<br>
faith in my own.  Life itself<br>
     is a miracle, in which I believe.  Language is a miracle. DNA is<br>
a miracle.  Intelligence is<br>
     a miracle.  The structure of matter and the laws by which the<br>
universe is constructed are<br>
     miracles.  The fact that mankind arose from such humble fibre as<br>
an Odd Little Primate,<br>
     is the biggest miracle of all.  <br>
<p>
3c)  How can good be defined as anything more or less than this.  Good<br>
is anything that has<br>
     the effect of insuring the survival or prosperity of the species<br>
in part or as a whole.  Bad<br>
     is anything that has the opposite effect.  A cultural or<br>
religious definition of good and<br>
     bad has no meaning at all.  Cultures rise and fall, religions<br>
continually redefine   <br>
     themselves with every generation.  There is a truth, that can<br>
easily be found.  It is self<br>
     evident.  Every honest human instinctively knows it.  It is not<br>
dictated by religious or<br>
     cultural bias, although it might be reinforced by them.  These<br>
are the seven basic truths.  <br>
<p>
3c1) Death is Bad. All humans while alive have the potential for good.<br>
The premature ending<br>
     of another's life has the effect of destroying that potential, of<br>
preventing it from ever<br>
     maturing into reality.  It ends all comfort they might have given<br>
to those around them.  It<br>
     stops the growth to intellectual or social enlightenment.  It is<br>
the finish to discovery for<br>
     the individual.  By ending another's life we cancel any benefit<br>
the species might have<br>
     enjoyed by the existence of this member.  Conversely anything we<br>
do that has the<br>
     potential for increasing our lifespan or the lifespan of the<br>
species is good. <br>
<p>
3c2) Abuse of another except in self-defense is bad.  No human being<br>
should ever harm<br>
     another, by violence, by emotional distress, or by verbal attack.<br>
To do so causes an<br>
     injury to the species as a whole.  Any victim of this abuse is<br>
rendered less productive,<br>
     and more introspective by the experience.  When we are occupied<br>
with "licking our<br>
     wounds" we can not benefit the species.  Everyone has the<br>
obligation to protect<br>
     themselves and fellow members of their human family from any such<br>
intrusion, perceived<br>
     or real.  Defense against abuse is good.  Reinforcement of<br>
another is good.  <br>
<p>
3c3) Species Classification is bad.  We are all members of one human<br>
family, the species<br>
     Homo Sapiens.  We are all decedents of the same Odd Little<br>
Primate that emerged from<br>
     the African continent in the distant past.  We share the same<br>
genetic code with all<br>
     ethnicities, nationalities, and religious groups.  Separate is<br>
not equal.  Any action or<br>
     belief that has the result of creating an "Us and Them" mentality<br>
between humans only<br>
     strangles one group or the other from realizing it's own<br>
potential.  Tolerance of those<br>
     you perceive to be different than yourself is good.  <br>
<p>
3c4) Ignorance is Bad.  Growth of the species can only happen if the<br>
current generation is<br>
     able to stand on the shoulders of the preceding one.  We can<br>
learn from our ancestors<br>
     mistakes.  Only by learning can we progress.  We must learn in<br>
order to survive.  We<br>
     must also teach.  We must teach the young everything we have<br>
learned from our<br>
     progenitors plus everything we have gleaned from our life so that<br>
we might form a<br>
     foundation for them to stand upon in their quest for more<br>
knowledge. This is critical for<br>
     the survival of the species.  No ethnicity, nationality or<br>
religious group can be excluded<br>
     from this obligation.  Potential for advancement in every field<br>
is evenly distributed<br>
     among all races, and nationalities.  This potential can not be<br>
realized if every generation<br>
     consumes it's life relearning lessons that were common knowledge<br>
to previous    <br>
     generations.  My children are obligated to be more intelligent<br>
than I.  Just as I am      <br>
     obligated to be more intelligent than my ancestors.  Learning is<br>
good.  <br>
<p>
3c5) Lying is bad. All humans must be endowed with a thirst for truth.<br>
Deception is evil<br>
     whether it is directed to the individual or to the whole.  It<br>
robs potential by bringing into<br>
     existence a spiraling vortex of error that wastes time causing<br>
deception to compound<br>
     deception until the very concept of truth is weakened.  It<br>
rattles it's ugly chains thru the<br>
     species as a whole.  There is no little white lie, there are only<br>
big monstrous ones. <br>
     Goodness and truth are the same thing.  <br>
<p>
3c6) Self destructive habits are bad. Your life must be spent for the<br>
advancement of the<br>
     species, or you are just excess baggage.  Any activity you engage<br>
in that cuts short the<br>
     length of your life limits your potential for good.  It prevents<br>
your efforts from ever<br>
     coming to a successful conclusion.  The only successful human is<br>
the one that advanced<br>
     the species during or because of his or her life.  Failure is the<br>
wasting away of potential. <br>
     Realization of potential is good.<br>
<p>
3c7) Theft is bad.  It doesn't matter whether the stolen thing is an<br>
idea, an object, or the<br>
     affection of another, it is evil and has the effect of causing<br>
strife within the species and<br>
     will result in any or all of the other bad things.  It can be the<br>
cause for Murder.  It is a<br>
     form of abuse to another member of your species.  It can be the<br>
cause of hate for those<br>
     you perceive as different from yourself.  It is ignorant, a lie<br>
and a self destructive habit.  <br>
<p>
3d)  Ignorance is the birthplace of all evil, and will if unchecked be<br>
the ultimate cause of the<br>
     extinction of the Species of Man..<br>
