<p>
Yes. I'm absolutely certain we're Turing Machines, in fact, I'm not only <br>
certain I'm pretty sure I'm correct too, but I'm not certain.<br>
              <br>

<i>        &gt;As our  consciousness cycles through the various states, driven by </i><br>
<i>        &gt;sensory input, two  separate consciousnesses may fleetingly produce </i><br>
<i>        &gt;similar/identical states  given identical sensory inputs? The paths </i><br>
<i>        &gt;leading to the momentary near-same  states can be different as well </i><br>
<i>        &gt;as the paths leading out of the state (hence  the inability to know </i><br>
<i>        &gt;what it is like to be someone else, even if you  fleetingly  produce </i><br>
<i>        &gt;a similar state), </i><br>
<p>
              <br>
It wouldn't matter what the true history of the two brains were or if the <br>
path leading up to the merger were different, if they're in the same state <br>
now then they must have exactly the same memories too. And the two brains <br>
would remain in identical states forever, unless random factors intervene, <br>
but I don't think randomness has much to do with consciousness.<br>
<p>
For me to know exactly what it's like to be you you'd have to change my brain <br>
into an identical copy of yours, but even then it wouldn't work because the <br>
person experiencing the consciousness wouldn't be me it would be you. <br>
James Rogers is not a thing that's conscious, James Rogers IS consciousness, <br>
thus I can never experience your consciousness because if I could I wouldn't  <br>
be John Clark any longer, I'd be you by definition, so John Clark still would <br>
not know what it's like to be James Rogers.<br>
                 <br>

<i>        &gt;Hmm... It seems that I've made consciousness look like a really         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;complex stream function (like an RC4 PRNG).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
In a cryptographic function a small change in input leads to a huge change  <br>
in output, consciousness can't be that sensitive or we'd be undergoing <br>
violent mood swings every second.<br>
