               <br>
<p>
Now that Mr. Bags has dumped widgets on the market they're dirt cheap and <br>
that means demand for them is huge. If the price is to remain cheap Mr. Bags <br>
must build more factories and increase production, now he's loosing money at  <br>
an accelerating rate. Mr. Bags has more money than I do but he looses money <br>
on every widget sold and right now he's selling a lot more widgets than I am. <br>
I temporally stop production and wait for Mr. Bags to file for Chapter 11 <br>
bankruptcy. I won't have long to wait.<br>

<i>        &gt;a big reason that the Japanese companies eventually backed off their         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;[RAM] dumping strategies was because of the trade sanctions         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;threatened/carried out by the US gvt. in retaliation. </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
The US government sanctions hurt US companies more than the Japanese, that's <br>
why they stopped them. The Japanese built fewer RAM factories which mente <br>
fewer sales by the largest semiconductor manufacturing equipment company in <br>
the world, the American company Applied Materials. Higher RAM prices mente <br>
more expensive computers which mente fewer were sold which mente fewer <br>
microprocessors were needed which hurt the largest semiconductor company in <br>
the world, the American company INTEL. Fewer computers need less software and  <br>
that hurt the largest software company in the world the American company  <br>
Microsoft.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I'd rather have rules of engagement that stopped the economic         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;warfare from escalating in this manner.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not me! In the entire history of human beings on planet Earth the price of <br>
nothing, absolutely nothing, has dropped further or faster than the price of <br>
RAM in the last 20 years, and in spite of this, or rather because of it, the  <br>
people who sell it have gotten immensely rich. The government tells me they  <br>
will be happy to fix this horrible problem, no thank you.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I am aware of several major RAM production facilities in TX that         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;were shutdown, </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
Nothing unusual or sinister in that, we're not talking about a steel mill <br>
here. You build a 2 billion dollar state of the art semiconductor fabrication <br>
plant and it's the wonder of the world for about 2 years, for another 2 years <br>
it can make less demanding second line chips, then the obsolete fab is ready <br>
to be torn down to make room for a new plant with improved technology.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>       &gt;then sold and reconfigured to other industrial purposes altogether. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
So what? The RAM business is profitable, the microprocessor and signal  <br>
processing business is even more profitable.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;there's far fewer small players in this mkt now not because of high         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;production costs</i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
Nonsense. A next generation semiconductor fabrication plant will cost <br>
5 billion dollars, that's for one plant. How many players can afford that?<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;but because it's generally accepted that </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Generally accepted by who?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;you need deep pockets/govt help to survive in this industry of dirty         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;tricks. </i><br>
          <br>
And you think government will protect the weak from these dirty tricks? <br>
Ridiculous. Making friends with the weak and enemies of the powerful is no <br>
way for a politician to stay in power.<br>
