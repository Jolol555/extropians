<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Got news for ya: government is inherently adversarial - if it weren't, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't need force.  If you're serious about "eliminating the `them vs. us'</i><br>
<i>&gt; syndrome", concentrate on voluntary action *outside* the domain where every</i><br>
<i>&gt; action is a defeat for somebody.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; AMG questions:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is it possible that the force that government occasionally uses is due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the lack of participation by those effected by lack of fair and equitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; representation? Is it possible that the system is so non-representative --</i><br>
<i>&gt; and becoming increasingly so -- because of the constraints imposed on those</i><br>
<i>&gt; selected to be our representatives by monied special interests?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is it possible that increased, and improved education with a stronger focus</i><br>
<i>&gt; on scientific method, critical reasoning,emphasizing independent and</i><br>
<i>&gt; skeptical thinking might result in a small first step towards eliminating</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "them vs. us" syndrome? Is it possible that increased involvement by</i><br>
<i>&gt; those many people who feel disenfranchised, frustrated and disgusted by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; the present system might, through their activism, help the present system</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolve?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are there other more realistic, practical and viable alternatives that can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be effectively implimented over the short, intermediate and long term?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yes, a very easy one - decentralization. No matter how equitable and<br>
fair a representational system may be, once it grows in terms of total<br>
participating population, it will reach a point where more and more of<br>
the populace will feel like their voice counts for less and less, and<br>
they are right. One man's vote in China, with a population of 1.2<br>
billion, counts for far less than one man's vote in Lichtenstein, or<br>
England. And having constituent's representatives representing larger<br>
and larger precincts also leads to this. THus, the interim solution<br>
would be to move as much power OUT of the federal government, to the<br>
states, and from there to the counties and municipalities, as well as to<br>
increase the number of popular representatives. Time was when a US<br>
Congressional Representative actually represented less than 50,000<br>
people, no longer. I "know" my vote counts for far more, and my voice is<br>
heard far easier at my city government level.<br>
<p>
Another solution is to put more laws to vote by the people directly. I<br>
expect that within 10 years, we will have public voting over the<br>
internet on a wide variety of laws, and elections.<br>
