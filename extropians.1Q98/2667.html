<i>&gt; &gt; Then I withdraw the fanciful metaphor.  My first draft put it this way:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You said that if Mrs O'Connor had had an abortion then our Max,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not a "precursor" of miscellaneous tissue, would have been murdered.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But if Mr &amp; Mrs O'Connor had used effective contraception, Max More</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would be just as absent from our world.  Would that be any less murder?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Every sperm is sacred..."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Um, no.  A single ejaculation involves perhaps millions of sperm, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the extremely unusual case as many as three of them might survive</i><br>
<i>&gt; to adulthood.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously God has a rather lower opinion of sperm than to deem them</i><br>
<i>&gt; "sacred".</i><br>
<p>
Although in the old testament, He declared,"do not spill your seed upon the<br>
ground."<br>
<p>
However, threats of blindness were never explicitly recorded..... ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ova, on the other hand, perhaps as many as a third could survive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; adulthood.  God obviously has a higher opinion of ova than of sperm,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and we don't want to argue with God, do we?  So we should prohibit</i><br>
<i>&gt; female virginity, or even sexual abstinence by females.</i><br>
<p>
I dunno, all those wasted periods, remaining a virgin until married off.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   (removing tongue from cheek)</i><br>
<p>
Thats disgusting.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   (on second thought, putting it back for a second)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Remember, if God wanted us to go naked, we'd be born that way.</i><br>
<p>
if god didn't want us to waste sperm or ova, we'd have push buttons for our use<br>
when we  really needed it.....<br>
<p>
if god didn't want us to commit suicide, he wouldn't have invented carbon monoxide,<br>
or curare, or arsenic, or hydrogen cyanide, or the ook ook tree frog.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; [...]  In Oregon, the logic of the statist establishment of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; death-worshipping as the official religion means that my tax dollars are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; now being reallocated to the poor so they can pay a doctor to murder them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; on demand.  I am soiled by this [...]</i><br>
<p>
Just so long as I don't have to pay your dry cleaning bill.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;  48% of Oregon voters, including me, voted against doctor-assisted suicide,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; aka, licensing doctors to murder.  [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I agree that making you pay for it is intolerably cruel.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But it's absurd to call it murder when done at the victim's request.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; [...] the core ethics of Western Civilization that have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; worked well for centuries on end, namely, humans are not to be used as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; means because they are ends in themselves.  [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I dunno about you, but I use other humans as means every day:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I call it trade.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<p>
I call it humor.<br>
