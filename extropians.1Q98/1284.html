<i>&gt;&gt; Point 1. The laser was not `invented' from the need for new surgical</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; instruments, nor the nanotube from the need of new fibres, nor radar</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; from the need to detect enemy aircraft, nor the chip for the purpose</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of miniaturization, nor, nor, .....</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Most fundamental advances have emerged from `pure' curiosity-driven</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; research, not from goal-directed pursuits. The rapid publication of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; unfettered research in the open literature leads to its free use for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; technological development by business, industry, government or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; individual entrepreneurs.</i><br>
<p>
(a) He's trying to slip in the presupposition that private<br>
research is goal-directed while public research is basic.  This<br>
is simply false.  A large amount of basic researh is funded by<br>
visionary companies and individuals, and a large factor in the<br>
process of getting a government grant is the ability to show a<br>
goal for one's research.  Indeed, the private sector can<br>
speculate /more/ freely on research, because one only has to<br>
justify the expense to a few investors rather than to all voters.<br>
(b) The naked assertion that most fundamental advances came from<br>
basic research rather than goal-directed research is simply false.<br>
The transistor was invented on Bell Labs' dime by a goal-directed<br>
project; packet-switched networking (the foundation of modern<br>
communications, including the Internet) was a product of goal-<br>
directed research at MIT.  Darwin worked unpaid aboard the<br>
Beagle, and was supported by his father while he wrote.  Florey,<br>
Chain, and Flemings development of penicillin, for which they<br>
received the Nobel prize, was funded by the Rockefeller Founda-<br>
tion.  Are these not the "fundament advances" he talks about?<br>
If all he can offer is scattered anecdotes, then hit him back<br>
with some of those.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Point 2. The Private Sector is inefficient at producing basic advances</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; because of the proprietary secrecy and patenting which accompanies</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; it. This secrecy leads to considerable duplication of research effort</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; across an industry, such as pharmaceuticals. It is because such research</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is not openly published for all to take advantage of, that I think such</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; research has no place at a university. [Suppose the laser had been</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; invented by Laser Corporation: they would have kept silent about it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; until all THEIR ideas were patented, and we would have missed-out on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; most of the developments of the laser these past 38 years.]</i><br>
<p>
(a) While non-directed research might be good at discovery, it's <br>
lousy at /development/, and undeveloped discoveries never go anywhere.<br>
Edison never made any discoveries about electricity, but the fact<br>
that he produced a practical application, and got electric lights<br>
installed in millions of homes, made further research cheaper and<br>
easier to do.<br>
(b) The parenthetical here is pure speculation, and beneath the<br>
dignity of honest debate.  Any practical invention such as the<br>
laser will find itself being applied wherever a profit can be made<br>
by either production by the inventor or licensing.  Companies<br>
actually prefer licensing inventions, because it's less work than<br>
production and distribution.  Duplication of research (not a bad<br>
thing itself, really) only happens when the discoveries are not<br>
well developed and well known, and the best way to develop and<br>
spread anything is to make a profitable product.<br>
(c) Patents are not part of the free market; they are government-<br>
imposed restrictions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 3. Industry tends to be short on altruism: the CEO of a major</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; automobile manufacturer said recently, "we are not here to make cars</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; or employ people, but simply to make money for our shareholders,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; whatever it takes". And just this week, MacBlo closed its R &amp; D</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; centre in Burnaby because of short-term bottom-line myopia.</i><br>
<p>
Wow, what a wonderful thing for a CEO to say--name that company,<br>
and I'll start investing.  A short-sighted company will suffer<br>
at its own hand, and good riddance.  IBM and AT&amp;T will be around<br>
and funding research for centuries.  Altruism is not industry's<br>
job; so what?  If the goal is to do research that benefits<br>
people's lives, what better incentive to do that than that of<br>
selling those things at a profit?  What incentive does some lab<br>
rat at NIH really have to do a good job compared to the chemist<br>
whose stock option values depend on it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 4. We, the public, pay for Government operations through `tax'</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; dollars and for the Private Sector with `after-tax' dollars (as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; consumers). Why do we seem to get so hot under the collar about a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; dollars spent by governments on pure research at universities, while</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; shrugging our shoulders at the excesses and extravagances of major</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; businesses and industries -- whose costs we absorb on the ticket of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; items such as food, housing, travel, hair-dying and E-mailing.</i><br>
<p>
I have a choice about which car to drive (if any at all), which<br>
hair dye to buy (not very useful in my case:), and which e-mail<br>
system to use.  Give me a choice of which government to pay for,<br>
and I'll consider that argument valid.<br>
