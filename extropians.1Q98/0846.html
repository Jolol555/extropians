One of William Gibson's characters (in _Burning Chrome_) suggested that<br>
visiting extraterrestrials would probably recognize corporations as the<br>
dominant organisms.<br>
<p>
Perhaps a taxonomy of superorganisms could be constructed: governments,<br>
corporations, religions, and subcultures remind me of meme-complexes<br>
competing for the belief-space of a single individual.<br>
<p>
The individual's memes "live" in the brain; they share neural pathways and<br>
connections.  The specific cell doesn't matter but rather that the<br>
connections exist.  Similarly, governments and other superorganisms don't<br>
need or care about the particular individuals who serve as their "cells";<br>
what matters is that some individual play a particular role.<br>
<p>
Governments and religions such as the RC Church and Tibetan Buddhism seem<br>
to be particularly robust superorganisms.  Corporations strike me as more<br>
dependent on the attributes of specific people.  Would a company like<br>
Microsoft exist without Bill Gates?<br>
