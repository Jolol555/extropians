You may get this impression, but it comes mainly from the worldview propagated<br>
by the media and the propaganda itself. To be more precise: <br>
<p>
1) There are lots of books saying the stuff you just said, that conspiracy<br>
theories are a new religion of the Generation Y (or Q, or ABC, anything but<br>
X), that they help to explain things etc. Their evidence or inspiration is the<br>
conspiracy stuff shown in TV.<br>
<p>
2) A lot of pseudo-conspiracy-theory stuff like the X-Files is broadcasted in<br>
TV. It's desinformation, plain bullshit and sometimes true information all<br>
mixed together. And it's popular as hell. But not because of its conspiracies,<br>
but because it deals with supernatural stuff,<br>
has nice special effects, a good marketing department and likeable actors (the<br>
last factor is important, too, as many X-clones failed).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To me this is a sign of sloppy thinking. Sure, there are dirty</i><br>
<i>&gt; dealings and secret alliances out there, but that doesn't give</i><br>
<i>&gt; conspiracy theories explanatory power. A conspiracy theory usually</i><br>
<i>&gt; works by showing some suggestive but weak evidence, and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; explaining away the lack of confirmation by cover-up. It is</i><br>
<i>&gt; unfalsifiable ("Of course there are no witnessess, they have all been</i><br>
<i>&gt; scared into silence"), defends itself vigorously from criticism ("See?</i><br>
<i>&gt; They have indoctrinated you too!") and promotes spread (in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; help others see the truth). In short, they make very efficient memes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but they do not have to be true to spread well.</i><br>
<p>
By this defintion, conspiracy theories perfectly fit here. I've oftenly been<br>
accused of being indoctrinated by "liberal media" or being an evil socialist.<br>
The sources I've stated have been declared useless because they came in part<br>
from the government or "conspiracy theorists". The suggestive but weak<br>
evidence: "We all pay too many taxes, government is robbing us."<br>
<p>
You are called a conspiracy theorist when you only mention the CIA nowadays.<br>
Ian Goddard's postings about TWA 800 were all of very high quality and<br>
although some of his conclusions are a little naive, I've archived them all.<br>
The recent forwards from Albionic were a bit poor of evidence, but I know that<br>
these guys can do better than this. Don't get too confused in this huge game<br>
of information and desinformation. It's all a big conspiracy anyway.<br>
