Sorry for continuing an old thread, but I've been in Canada for a couple <br>
of weeks and just wanted to make a few brief 'drive-by' comments.<br>

In fact, I think you'll find that some years British football hooligans<br>
have killed more people at football matches than all the firearms<br>
murders in the country. Yet there are no massive media campaigns to ban<br>
football.<br>

I haven't seen any local news coverage yet, but according to the<br>
Canadian papers a prisoner was shot dead in the Maze in Ireland a few<br>
days ago. The Maze is probably the most secure prison in the United<br>
Kingdom, as it's where Irish terrorists are locked up. If prisoners<br>
can still acquire guns despite that security, what hope is there for<br>
disarming criminals in the general population?<br>
<p>
Wayne Hayes pointed to a Web site of murder rates, claiming that<br>
they were for the entire US. If he'd looked closely, he'd have<br>
noticed that they're actually for Florida alone, and completely<br>
contradict his claims that firearms availability causes crimes by<br>
showing a massive drop in murders after the passage of the Florida<br>
concealed carry law. <br>
