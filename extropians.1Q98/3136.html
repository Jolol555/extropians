Hey Mike, I think we should stop this nationalistic country-bashing-thing<br>
(it's gone a bit out of control I think ;-). You love your country and I<br>
like mine too so to prevent both of us ending up in kill-files why don't we<br>
call it quits for a while. I'll have one more and then you can have one<br>
more and that'll be the end of it OK? I don't think either one of us is<br>
convincing anyone here.<br>

Nothin' like a good 'ol generalisation to explain how the universe hangs<br>
together I say! That explains nicely why most european countries have five<br>
times as much political parties as the US that participate in national<br>
elections.<br>
Are you claiming that political prefferences are genetic? Interesting...<br>

<p>
??? On how many national Gov's is your opinion based? Any other than the US?<br>
I guess that due to our 'herd tendecies' our governement does a fairly<br>
effecient job on these kind of projects ;-)<br>
<p>
Do you even notice the fact that you automatically seem to judge all<br>
governemental systems based on your own experience/knowledge of the US<br>
situation?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;People do not become redundant, they merely are able to make more of</i><br>

<i> &gt;monotonous.</i><br>
<p>
IMHO: Less intelligent people are becoming quickly redundant (in an<br>
economic sense). That is what automation is all about, use expensive, smart<br>
machines to replace even more expensive not-so-smart people. You can think<br>
this is a good thing or not, but don't deny that it's happening. IMO we<br>
need to think about the social consequences of this proces.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Economic collapse: Soviet Union, Poland, E Germany, Romania, Cuba,</i><br>
<i> &gt;North Korea, Indonesia. All of which had large authoritarian, cradle</i><br>
<i> &gt;to grave systems.</i><br>
<p>
Indonesia certainly did not have a 'cradle to grave system'! And none of<br>
these were democratic countries. You really should learn to see the<br>
difference between the former communist countries and democratic ones that<br>
have some sort of support system for their citizens. This comparison makes<br>
as much sense as comparing the US to Germany in 1940 - none at all - is<br>
extremely insulting and does not prove anything except your lack of<br>
accurate informtion.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;(without massive per capita oil revinues, as the Dutch are so well endowed</i><br>
<i> &gt;with, which is mainly the source of your ability to slouch as much as you </i><br>
<i> &gt;wish).</i><br>
<p>
Didn't the US have lot's of oil in Texas and Alaska?<br>
<p>
The ability to take it easy as much 'as we wish' (but never more ;-) comes<br>
from having on of the worlds highest labour-productivity's and a growing<br>
'knowledge economy' that costs les natural resources per dollar. Not hard<br>
working but smart working, and not _minding_ that most of us can't drive V8<br>
jeeps or buy ultra-light planes. I mean, if you are as wealthy as you claim<br>
and you honestly believe you still need more goodies to be happy you must<br>
be missing out on something (appreciation, love, sex? - not neccesarily in<br>
that order).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Yes, and LA has one of the highest tax rates and one of the most</i><br>
<i> &gt;restrictive gun control laws in the entire nation. Some stability.</i><br>
<i> &gt;It also has one of the highest costs of living.</i><br>
<p>
Again: you compare only _within_ the US of A. This seems a bit limited<br>
(ever been anywhere?). From a mainland-european viewpoint the difference<br>
between LA and other parts of the US is not that staggering. The riots were<br>
however.<br>
<p>
If a welfare system does nothing else then its keeping angry impoverished<br>
mobs away from your doorstep. And if you don't believe that you should<br>
read-up on 18th century French history, especially the part about how<br>
Marie-Antoinette lost her head over a cake is very educational ;-)<br>
<p>
OK, your turn.<br>
