 How predictable the press. On November 19, 1997 I reported that <br>
 the FBI allowed reporters to view the reconstruction of TWA 800, <br>
 from which the nose section has been removed and remains hidden. <br>
 However, as freelance reporter Robert Davey -- one of the many<br>
 reporters to be allowed access -- told me, the FBI prohibited <br>
 access to the left side of the reconstruction. I predicted that <br>
 this blatant effort to suppress information even after the FBI <br>
 ended its criminal investigation would not be reported by the <br>
 press, even as dozens of reporters witnessed this act of evi-<br>
 dence suppression before their eyes. As I said on Nov. 19:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The FBI allowed reporters into the hangar today to view the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reconstruction. They would not allow a viewing of the left side.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I guess that side is still a part of the criminal investigation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mark my word, no publication or media report will note that access</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the left side was denied, even as every reporter there, by wit-</i><br>
<i>&gt; nessing that denial, must be the wiser, or brain dead, and I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; think any are brain dead. [1]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
 Just too predictable, mark my word indeed: the only media account <br>
 I've found of the "access" fails to mention that only half of the <br>
 nose-section-removed and wingless reconstruction was allowed to be <br>
 viewed -- which means about 2/3rds of the aircraft are NOT allowed <br>
 to be viewed. This is that account from the L.A. Times (11/20/97): <br>
<p>
<p>
	FBI ALLOWS PRESS TO VIEW TWA WREAKAGE<br>
<p>
	One day after the FBI pulled out of the <br>
	probe into the cause of the July 1996 <br>
	explosion of TWA Flight 800, investigators <br>
	allowed reporters to view the reassembled <br>
	wreckage for the first time. The wreckage, <br>
	most of it resurrected from the ocean floor <br>
	by divers, rises from the floor of a hanger <br>
	in Calverton, N.Y., its more than 1 million <br>
	parts crudely attached to metal scaffolding. <br>
	"You can't look at the plane without seeing <br>
	the souls of those who were lost," said James <br>
	K. Kallstrom, who headed the FBI's investiga-<br>
	tion into the explosion, "and at the same <br>
	time think of the strength and courage of <br>
	the families of these victims." The National <br>
	Transportation Safety Board has hearings <br>
	scheduled next month in its efforts to find <br>
	a cause. The hearings may continue well <br>
	into next year.  [ END OF REPORT ]<br>
<p>
<p>
 The Times was sure to quote Kallstrom saying "You can't look <br>
 at the plane without seeing the souls of those who were lost,"<br>
 yet conveniently declined to inform us that the FBI also said<br>
 that you  CAN'T LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANE, not to <br>
 mention you  can't look at the entire nose section or wings. <br>
 I guess these parts of the plane, which were recovered, are <br>
 just not important, even as reports said the nose section, <br>
 far removed from the fuel tanks and the first major part <br>
 of the plane to fall away, took one hell of a hit.<br>
<p>
 Not only is it outrageous that the media, as I predicted, <br>
 fails to report that access to the left side was prohibited,<br>
 but to also lead us to believe that the FBI has allowed free<br>
 inspection of the physical evidence when in fact the nose sec-<br>
 tion is removed and hidden is as outrageous as the press report-<br>
 ing (assuming this happened) that the FBI allowed the press to <br>
 inspect President Kennedy's corpse and yet the press fails to <br>
 mention his head was missing. The FBI's investigation of TWA<br>
 800 and the major media's coverage is a hoax by definition.<br>
<p>
 The major media in the U.S. is uniformly nothing more than a <br>
 propaganda arm of the Federal Government and no amount of murder<br>
 or mayhem on the part of the  Federal Government  will break the<br>
 media's commitment to serve the Federal Government in an effort <br>
 to prevent knowledge of truth. The major media and the Federal<br>
 Government are  allied against  the interests of the American<br>
 people and seem committed instead to a course of progressive <br>
 Federal Government expansion and the integration of the <br>
 U.S. Government into a New World Government.<br>

769 <br>
<p>
Here we can see a photo of the right side of the reconstruction<br>
at an angle allowing us to see that the nose section is missing:<br>
<a href="http://cnn.com/US/9705/12/twa/">http://cnn.com/US/9705/12/twa/</a> See the second image. Notice that<br>
CNN calls  the reconstructed aircraft  without a nose section a<br>
"complete" reconstruction. That's like calling a house without<br>
a roof a "complete" house. How stupid do they think we are? <br>
<p>
There have been a few photos in the press of the left side of<br>
the aircraft that the  FBI prohibited access to in the case<br>
cited above. The best image of the left side is at my web<br>
page here: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/crash.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/crash.htm</a> From<br>
this angle you can see the nose section missing. Why<br>
the FBI now disallowed the viewing we have here is<br>
not clear,  except that they may not have wanted<br>
people to inspect the hole I noticed. If there<br>
was nothing to hide, they would not hide it,<br>
and yet they are now hiding it along with<br>
the wings and the entire nose section.<br>
