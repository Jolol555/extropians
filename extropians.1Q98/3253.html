<i>       &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;I can't prove I wasn't at the scene of most murders, neither can you.</i><br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;den Otter" &lt;otter@globalxs.nl&gt;</i><br>
<i>	&gt;You can if you document your life (mini audio/video) and/or others, </i><br>
<i>	&gt;like the government are doing it for you. </i><br>
<p>
I concede that if you let me provide the video tape I can give you iron clad <br>
proof that I was not at the crime scene, even if I was.<br>
			<br>
<i>	&gt;Really tough cases could be left to (teams of) human judges ('till </i><br>
<i>	&gt;the advent of AI), </i><br>
<p>
<p>
An AI may have other concerns, do you care if snails live together in justice?<br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Judges would be required to take "common sense" tests as part of </i><br>
<i>	&gt;their training.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think that's a fine idea, provided of course I decide what is common sense <br>
and give the test.<br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;the crimes that threaten society most like street violence will be </i><br>
<i>	&gt;hit the hardest by increased surveillance.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Street violence doesn't threaten society, and the individuals it does <br>
threatens are rare. In the USA violent crime has declined for 6 years in a <br>
row, that's why your idea of turning the entire world into one big <br>
concentration camp in order to solve a trivial problem makes no sense. <br>
Yes I could be killed by some mugger on the street, but history has shown I'm <br>
far more likely to die because a government says I've slandered it, or <br>
because it forces me to fight in some idiotic war, or because it thinks it's <br>
smarter than the market, impoverishes my society and causes me to starve.  <br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Miss Marple-esque murder mysteries aren't exactly the rule, you know.</i><br>
<p>
True, because most real murder mysteries are never solved. <br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Cases like O.J. Simpson, where an obvious murderer can never be </i><br>
<i>	&gt;brought to justice because the judicial system fucked up the first </i><br>
<i>	&gt;time around must be prevented however. This means that even if </i><br>
<i>	&gt;someone has initially been found innocent, he *can* be tried for the </i><br>
<i>	&gt;same crime at a later date if new evidence comes up.</i><br>
	     <br>
<p>
This is a good example, the judicial system did fuck up but unfortunately <br>
there's nothing unusual there. A mountain of evidence was presented at the <br>
trial, more than enough to convict I think, evidently you agree, but others <br>
disagree including the jury and significant new evidence has not turned up. <br>
So what do we do, keep retrying a person till we get a verdict we like? <br>
If I'm convicted and I don't like it can I keep getting new trials until <br>
I'm  found innocent?<br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;the torture that is applied to especially cruel/multiple murderers,</i><br>
<i>	&gt;which they duly deserve.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Duly deserve? Again we find a major disagreement on the nature of Justice. <br>
My definition, Justice is the course of action that reduces the amount of <br>
suffering in the world the most.<br>
Your definition, Justice is the course of action that rewards victims by <br>
entertaining them with the suffering of people they don't like.<br>
	 <br>
<i>	&gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>	&gt;&gt;Do you really find it hard to understand why anybody and everybody </i><br>
<i>	&gt;&gt;would be more than nervous when police bring them in?</i><br>
	 <br>
<i>	&gt;That depends on the public's trust in the system, the PR of the </i><br>
<i>	&gt;police etc. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Good PR needs a jingle, how about "A day without torture is like a day <br>
without sunshine". Then we could have a sitcom about the wacky adventures of <br>
Tommy the Torturer, like the time his boss told him to draw and quarter a <br>
prisoner but by mistake he burned him at the stake instead. A laugh riot! <br>
Fun for the whole family! Then we need a kid show about your friendly <br>
neighborhood torturer, perhaps we could interest the Disney people, or the<br>
Muppets.<br>
	 <br>
<i>	&gt;people won't be too scared when politely asked to come to down to </i><br>
<i>	&gt;the station.  [...]  At the stage that someone is requested to </i><br>
<i>	&gt;appear at a hearing it must already be 99% (so to speak) sure that </i><br>
<i>	&gt;he's guilty.</i><br>
	<br>
<p>
Let's see, when the police politely ask me to come down to the station I know  <br>
that there is a 99% chance that they think I'm guilty and duly deserve to be <br>
slowly tortured to death but there is no reason I should be nervous. <br>
Could you run that past me again?  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>	&gt;The damage has been done by then, and is often irreversible. You </i><br>
<i>	&gt;might take the slanderer down with you, but that won't undo the </i><br>
<i>	&gt;damage to your reputation. It's better to prevent it alltogether, by </i><br>
<i>	&gt;law.</i><br>
	  <br>
If me taking the slanderer down with my words does not deter him why will the <br>
law do better? <br>
<p>
Fortunately the Internet and Cryptography are making this debate moot,  <br>
slander laws are becoming impossible to enforce. If I want to slander you I <br>
can do so anonymously and you can slander me back the same way. I don't think <br>
that will bring an end to civilization and because I'm not thin skinned I <br>
don't think it will bring the end to me either. You'll probably survive too.<br>
