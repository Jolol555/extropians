Well, I really think hemp is a way to open doors that are inside of us. Let<br>
us view the reality in another way that is very useful not only for artist<br>
but for any human kind.<br>
My points of view would never be the same if I didn´t smoke a long time ago.<br>
I began constructing a more open point of view of so many things. <br>
I didn´t change my previous thinkings, but they´ve grown more colorful,<br>
respectful of other´s points of view, and I hope deeper.<br>
Then comes an obvious question, why it is not legal? Well I´m not sure that<br>
the State wants us to be free, colorful, repectful, and so on...<br>
The state wants 1000 workers, for 2 or 3 thinkers. The thinkers -artists,<br>
designers- can smoke, but not everybody. Obviously I don´t agree with this. <br>
