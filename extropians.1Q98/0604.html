Nick Bostrom, &lt;bostrom@ndirect.co.uk&gt;, writes, quoting Hal:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Two possible theories, as I mentioned, are first that you create all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; possible universes with all different variations on the parameters</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; we observe.  This is probably a pretty simple theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem with this theory is that our univers is not what we </i><br>
<i>&gt; should expect it to be if this theory were true. If all locally </i><br>
<i>&gt; possible worlds are instantiated eqully numerously, then we should </i><br>
<i>&gt; not expect to find ourselves in one that is so highly ordered as </i><br>
<i>&gt; ours. For every possible world like this one, there are countless </i><br>
<i>&gt; ones where pink elephants sometimes materialize out of nowhere or </i><br>
<i>&gt; random  blue blobs form over houses whose street addresses are prime </i><br>
<i>&gt; numbers. If all these possible worlds were actual, then why are we </i><br>
<i>&gt; not in one of these irregular ones?</i><br>
<p>
I didn't mean that all logically possible universes would exist, but<br>
rather that a full spectrum of universes rather like our own would be<br>
created, with all possible variations on fundamental physical parameters,<br>
like the dimensionality of space and the strengths of the various forces.<br>
So this would not include universes where pink elephants materialize out<br>
of nowhere.<br>
<p>
However in the light of Nick's interpretation, maybe my idea is not<br>
so attractive.  I thought Wei's suggestion (as I understood it) was<br>
improbable that maybe just one universe exists which just happens to<br>
have physical properties that allow the formation of life.  It seemed<br>
too arbitrary.  I tried to suggest a simpler model in which all possible<br>
variations would exist.  But I was still constraining the variations to<br>
be those which are not so terribly different from our own.  Fundamentally<br>
maybe that is really just as limited, compared with the alternative that<br>
Nick is suggesting.<br>
