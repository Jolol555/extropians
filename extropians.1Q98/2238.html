<i>&gt;&gt;  Would you care to propose a one or two sentence rule which is simple to</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Power?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Here are a few one-sentence suggestions (in descending order of personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;attractiveness):</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Be a Power myself.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. Facilitate the proliferation of competing Powers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. Undertake memetic engineering to spread some such injunction as</i><br>
<i>&gt;"respect diversity," "respect rights," "abhor unecessary suffering," etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;4. Befriend the right Powers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;5. Lay low.</i><br>
<p>
 The effectiveness of #3 is unclear. I suspect it needs to be significantly<br>
more complex to have a reasonable chance of working.<br>
 As for the others, I sure wish I knew a simple way to follow them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;  I thought surely that accusing you of stereotyping people would provoke</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; you to clarify your reasoning, but I'm more confused than before about</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; why you think intolerance is associated with the goal of simplicity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I said that whenever I hear someone claim that simplicity is important to</i><br>
<i>&gt;a proper moral outlook, I think of purity, closemindedness, intolerance. </i><br>
<i>&gt;You thought that this would be because I associated the value of</i><br>
<i>&gt;simplicity with a lack of education.  Again, I don't think this is so.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;just think the word "simplicity" (whenever it takes on an ethical</i><br>
<i>&gt;register)  sets off different associations for me than it does for you. </i><br>
<i>&gt;If I had any stereotypical figures in mind here they would be evangelical</i><br>
<i>&gt;Christians of the fag-hating Darwin-bashing kind or flamebreathing Randian</i><br>
<i>&gt;objectivists.  Neither of these figures are necessarily uneducated in my</i><br>
<i>&gt;view, tho' both seem to think that ethical truths are plainer and simpler</i><br>
<i>&gt;by far than I do.  I don't know that this clarifies my reasoning</i><br>
<i>&gt;particularly, but surely it will make you less confused (were you really?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;about where I'm coming from.  Best, Dale</i><br>
<p>
 Ok, I was wrong to guess that your stereotyping was based on education<br>
level assumptions.<br>
 I think you have an innacurate stereotype of Christian extremists.<br>
You may be partly right about Randians. They clearly value simplicity<br>
in moral rules, and their intolerance may be provoked by a need to hide<br>
from themselves the differences between the simple rules the claim are<br>
adequate and the somewhat more complex rules they actually obey.<br>
<p>
[I'm about go offline for a week's vacation, so it will be while before<br>
I respond. Your last reply in the "Respect for Animals, Respect for People"<br>
appears to be just a repetition of the ideas I thought I had already answered,<br>
so I probably won't respond further to that.]<br>
