Concerning this from Yak Wax...<br>
<p>
****<br>
"Why does it repel you?  Extropy is about rational<br>
thought, so what rational reason have you got against<br>
human culling, genocide or general murder?  Of<br>
course, you could argue that culling people is a bad<br>
idea because maybe you'll accidentally kill someone<br>
who would have been useful, etc.  But I'm talking<br>
about the act, what I want to know is for what<br>
rational reason does this *idea* repel you?<br>
<p>
I ask this not just because it's a difficult<br>
question, but because Extropy has rationality at its<br>
core.  Now it's possible to think of rational reasons<br>
for war, genocide, culling or anything else you care<br>
to mention, but when a reason against it is called<br>
for we tend to fall back on morality, ethics, and<br>
right and wrong.  These IMHO are weak arguments<br>
against raw and unrelenting rationality, so what<br>
defenses do we have against someone who's taken a<br>
very different slant on Extropy?"<br>
****<br>
<p>
There have been many attempts by philosophers to come<br>
up with RATIONALLY reasons to oppose war, genocide,<br>
murder, etc. I'm not expert enough in the subject of<br>
philosophy (or maybe I just don't want to spend a<br>
long time typing just now) to judge their success or<br>
lack of success.<br>
<p>
However, I will say that even if one of them was<br>
successful in coming up with RATIONAL reasons for<br>
behaving "morally", their reasons have so far failed<br>
to be as widely disemminated as the reasons<br>
associated with religious belief systems.<br>
<p>
The old standby of "what you sow, so shall you reap",<br>
can and has been restated less poetically along the<br>
lines "Humans tend to imitate one other. Your actions<br>
therefore influence the behavior of others. When you<br>
behave violently, you make people angry and influence<br>
them to do the same. In this way, violent behavior on<br>
your part adds to a violent atmosphere in society<br>
which injures you by making mutually-beneficial<br>
cooperation less likely and could even ultimately<br>
result in direct physical injury to yourself."<br>
However, people can always find enough squirming room<br>
in this sort of argument to rationalize major acts of<br>
violence, basically arguing that they can commit an<br>
act of violence and escape the negative consequences.<br>
A lot of people find this to be a major failure on<br>
the part of pure rationalism.<br>
<p>
<p>
As for this from den Otter...<br>
<p>
"Seriously...Wax has a point. Why are Star Trek (or<br>
My Little Pony) ethics so popular with this allegedly<br>
rational crowd? It does not compute."<br>
<p>
I suspect that many in this crowd supplement their<br>
extropianism with ethics from other sources.<br>
Extropianism is probably not their whole life.<br>
<p>
<p>
As for the use of tactics such as genocide for the<br>
furtherance of the interests of extropians, I also am<br>
repelled by such notions, and if they ever become<br>
even close to commonplace in extropianism, you can<br>
count me out.<br>
