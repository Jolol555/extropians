Actually, India really is in fairly good shape. There has been no major<br>
starvation there for many decades (unlike Africa), and the life<br>
expectancy has been improving dramatically along with the control of<br>
infectious diseases. Birth rates are on a rapid decline. While there has<br>
been some ethnic and religious violence, it is nothing like some of the<br>
horrors that have gone on places like Somalia or Rwanda. India has the<br>
rule of law (imperfect as it may be), a democratic system and it wisely<br>
has kept the world's greatest language, English. Per capita GDP is low,<br>
but improving slowly. Most people are still poor, but they are not<br>
totally destitute and seem to be happy with their lives. More people can<br>
afford "luxury" items these days. The socialistic policies of the<br>
Congress Party have held the country back, but everyone except the far<br>
left now agrees that more market liberalization is needed. Yes, you will<br>
find many pitiful beggars in any Indian village or city, but the poverty<br>
was far worse in the past. <br>
