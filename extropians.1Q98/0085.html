<i>        &gt;Nick Bostrom:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;What legitimate reason could anybody have for not wanting the law         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;enforcing agency scan his mind with this device in order to find out         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;if he had committed a crime?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I can think of several reasons for not wanting the police to scan my mind:<br>
<p>
1) I'm guilty, I committed the crime. <br>
2) I did not do it, but I don't believe the "crime" in question is a bad   <br>
   thing so I don't want to do anything to help its enforcement. <br>
3) I did not do it and I think the law is just, but I think such brain <br>
   scanning can lead a society to disaster so I don't want to encourage it. <br>
4) I have no confidence in the accuracy of the procedure.<br>
<p>
In the present day I have no confidence in the procedure, so I would only  <br>
consent to a lie detector test if I was guilty of the crime. I read of a good <br>
way to beat the machine, put a tack in your shoe. They always start with <br>
innocuous control questions to get a base line, "Is your name John K Clark?" <br>
I jab my toe with the tack and say "yes", "do you have twin sisters?" I jab <br>
my toe with the tack and say "yes", " are you 6 feet 3 inches tall?" I jab <br>
my toe with the tack and say "yes", then they get down to business, "did you <br>
kill Mr. Smith?" I do NOT jab my toe with the tack and say no.<br>
<p>
Because of this the first thing I do every day when I get up in the morning  <br>
is put a tack in my shoe, after all, you never know. If you lack my foresight  <br>
try biting your lip.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the main point, which is whether this technology should be exploited     </i><br>
   <br>
<p>
I agree, and my answer is no. A machine that could translate the states of <br>
neurons in my brain into memories and intentions and emotions and ideas is <br>
pretty sophisticated, we call such a machine a "mind". I can think of a lot <br>
of questions my lawyer would like to ask such a mind, "You say Mr. Clark <br>
committed the murders, not O J Simpson as most assume, because he has a <br>
memory of the crime, but couldn't this memory just be Mr. Clark imagining <br>
what the crime must have been like based on what he read in the newspapers?" <br>
and "is there  any reason you want Mr. Simpson to come out of this looking <br>
good" and "Do you personally dislike Mr.Clark and want to see him suffer?".<br>
Naturally my lawyer would demand that all technological means available be <br>
employed to determine if the mind's answers were truthful, and naturally that <br>
would lead to an infinite regress.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;imagine two societies, one where people voluntarily agree to submit         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to these scans, and another where they don't. Which one will you        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;prefer to live in? Will you voluntarily  agree to be scanned in this         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;limited and specific way, knowing that by doing so you will live in         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;a world in which virtually all criminals are caught, and hence that         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the crime rate is very low?  </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
Assuming for the sake of argument that the technology works as advertised <br>
I'd still much rather take my chances with being the victim of crime. <br>
Consider the alternative, anything, literally anything that Big Brother says <br>
is exactly the way things are going to be, if he say's nobody must ever think <br>
bad thoughts about the government then in actuality nobody will ever think <br>
bad thoughts about the government. Not ever.<br>
<p>
The trouble is that if the powers that be become totalitarian, and history  <br>
tells us that sooner or later they will, then that's the way things will stay <br>
for eternity . Nothing could ever change, revolt would be impossible.<br>
