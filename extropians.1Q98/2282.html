Some additional advantages of the Mars trip (see Mars post no. 1) would <br>
probably be that it would create all kinds of useful technological spinoffs<br>
(perfected suspended animation, which would make the trip dramatically <br>
easier and cheaper, might get some more attention and funding, for<br>
example) *and* it would almost certainly give an impulse to governmental<br>
space programs (a matter of ego, paranoia and greed), which would in<br>
turn produce even more useful spinoffs. Once on Mars, the motivation <br>
to develop new technologies would be much higher, because you need<br>
high tech to survive &amp; prosper, while on earth the situation is somewhat<br>
less urgent. Also, there wouldn't (initially) be much else to do then to<br>
develop new ways to make life more comfortable. Since you have your<br>
"spies" (mechanical/human) on earth you don't have to miss out on new<br>
developments, on the contrary, new technologies can be implemented<br>
much more rapidly because the laws on Mars are presumably liberal, <br>
and there's more than enough room to test potentially dangerous new<br>
stuff etc.<br>
<p>
The only real problem is, IMO, money. However, there are lots of groups<br>
that want to colonize space, for whatever reason. Also, there are some<br>
private companies that (aim to) produce relatively cheap commercial<br>
spacecraft. Some kind of alliance would seem like the logical thing to<br>
do. Like I said before, any philosophical or other differences can be <br>
always settled once everybody is offplanet, and in any case there's<br>
space enough for everybody in space. There are a lot more people<br>
interested in space colonization, than in, say, cryonics, and some of<br>
these people may be very rich (they might duly see a lot of potential<br>
$$$$$$ in this undertaking). After all, this isn't just fun, but also<br>
the opportunity to stake your claims almost at will in the new frontier.<br>
Funding the private colonization of Mars (and other parts of the <br>
Solar System) should thus be feasible.<br>
<p>
(and yes, you could even do it without the rich benefactors if you set<br>
up some lucrative gambling 'n' stuff in some appropriate location<br>
(like the Bahama's), or create some hugely successful electronics<br>
company, market a totally cool new smart drug etc...but let's assume<br>
no-one will do this).<br>
<p>
[Oops, I'm rambling again...pardon the high SF-factor, but after all this<br>
*is* a list where even crazier topics (like putting your mind into a machine,<br>
and robots the size of a virus -- yeah right ;-) are discussed, so some<br>
space travel will hardly make it weirder...]<br>
