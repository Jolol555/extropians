The statement was made that in a future where MNT reached its full potential<br>
(as described by Drexler) that the only commodity (scarce resource) would be<br>
creativity.  I am not comfortable with this statement.  The underlying<br>
assumption in the statement is artificial intelligence will not be able to be<br>
creative.  I am not a cognition expert but I am not so sure that we should<br>
attribute creativity exclusively to humans.  As I undestand it, we do not have<br>
a thorough understanding of how creativity works.  If this is the case I think<br>
it is premature to assume that artificial intelligence in the future will not<br>
be able to be creative.<br>
<p>
This entire issue gets back to the strong AI/weak AI issue.  I believe this is<br>
the most significant issue when speculating on how the future will look.  If<br>
creativity is a computable problem, meaning if it could be manifested by some<br>
algorithm, then even weak AI could be creative.  If creativity is some result<br>
of brain functions entirely alien to computation then it is still possible that<br>
it could result from the cognitive activities of a strong AI entity.  Thus it<br>
appears its possible that in a MNT future that creativity could be a commodity<br>
but only in a weak AI future where creativity turns out to be a noncomputable<br>
function.<br>
