That's merely an assertion, as yet unsupported (but not disproved) by<br>
research. I'd agree that *if* consciousness requires QM effects then a<br>
pure digital computer with no QM interaction cannot be conscious, but<br>
I'm still waiting to see whether this is a requirement; as we learn more<br>
about the brain, more and more of human behaviour can be explained in a<br>
purely macroscopic fashion.<br>

Oh nonsense. Let's actually read the Constitution, shall we?<br>
<p>
"Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the<br>
several  States which may be included within this Union, according to<br>
their   respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the<br>
whole   Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a<br>
Term of  Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all<br>
other   Persons."<br>
<p>
Now, where does that specifically mention slaves, or say that they're<br>
less than human? All it says is that the number of representatives and<br>
the apportioning of taxes will be calculated by taking the number of<br>
voters/tax-payers and a fraction of the number of non-voters. "Other<br>
persons" couldn't vote, so there's absolutely no point in counting them<br>
the same way as voters; this discourages states from acquiring more<br>
representatives by bringing in thousands of slaves.<br>
