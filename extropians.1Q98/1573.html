I believe that there is no convincing evidence to lead one unequivocally state<br>
that software will not eventually be "conscious" or "intelligent" (comparable<br>
with human intelligence).  The reasons given by those who do state such things<br>
are impossible are almost dogmatic.  Their reasons  (when you get past all the<br>
fancy technospeak) are basically summed up in the phrase "it just does not seem<br>
like it should be possible".  I like to stay away from positions that presume<br>
something intrinsically mystical or special about the human mind.  We used to<br>
think we were special by our location in the universe and in the solar system,<br>
by our species, by our "divine" image and so forth.  The belief (subtle that it<br>
is) now is that the seat of our essence, the mind, is somehow unique or beyond<br>
mere technology.<br>
<p>
I understand the position that people doubt "machines" could achieve a<br>
conscious state, or wonder if such entities would be creative.  But emphatic<br>
positions that such things can never come to pass are uncomfortable to me.  I<br>
can not say that such a thing will surely come to pass either.  I do not know<br>
what mechanisms would bring about consciousness.  But no one knows what<br>
mechanisms present in the human mind would forbid it either.<br>
<p>
I may be stating the obvious.  But it appears sometimes that the obvious is<br>
cast aside in the interest of human pride.<br>
