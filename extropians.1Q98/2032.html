What's the evidence that enhancements are likely to be suppressed?  Many<br>
people seem to assume that anything useful but weird will be attacked<br>
and banned.  They're probably right on the attack, but banned?<br>
Possibly, but can it be said to be certain.<br>
<p>
What enhancements are banned now?  A problem seems to be that there<br>
aren't all that many genuine enhancements.  There are a bunch of drugs<br>
which make the user happy; while I don't agree with the war on drugs,<br>
and want to see legalization, most of them are in fact addictive, AFAIK.<br>
The most useful seem to be caffeine, which is legal, and marijuana,<br>
which causes frothing insanity in prohibitionists.  I posit that if MJ<br>
was legal now it would remain so, and that the pressure on it comes from<br>
it having become illegal in the past and a perception that if it is<br>
rescured other drugs might be as well.  "No surrender, no retreat."  How<br>
practically useful MJ is to people not suffering certain types of severe<br>
pain is scientifically unclear at the moment.<br>
<p>
The usefulness and dangers of LSD and peyote I'm not sure about.<br>
Certainly they don't seem useful in a normal economic sense.  Even if<br>
they're safe, possibly the war on drugs is, as above, as much about<br>
protecting a current fief as about a generic desire to ban odd things.<br>
<p>
In vitro fertilization and surrogate pregnancy caused great horror and<br>
religious outcry, but are useful and legal.  I suspect genetic testing<br>
will not be touched.  Gene research has trouble in Germany but they live<br>
under the Nazi shadow.  (An argument against Euro-unification, similar to<br>
Diamond's thesis of why Europe eventually surpassed China: multiple<br>
countries make it harder to stupidly ban something.)  Genetic engineering<br>
may go under the ban, but at the moment I think any attempts to modify a<br>
human embryo would involve a good deal of risk to the resulting human;<br>
our knowledge is not that great.  Whether parents should have the right<br>
to take such risks with their children is debatable.  The growth of full<br>
clones seems likely to be made illegal, which I can't justify with any<br>
sophisty I take seriously; on the other hand, I can't get that excited<br>
over it either.  The technical cloning of growing cell lines or new<br>
organs from an adult, which would be very useful, seems to have a fair<br>
chance of surviving, if it ever actually happens.<br>
<p>
Steroids are clearly useful and clearly risky, AFAIK.  Their prohibition<br>
in sports is just part of the rules of the game.  Their general<br>
prohibition is part of state maternalism; again, I don't like it, but<br>
they do have a point, and I'm not dying to take the things.  My point,<br>
if it isn't clear by now, is that I see no reason to assume that<br>
economically useful and fairly safe enhancements will be banned.<br>
It violates sense, and has little precedent.  New but useful<br>
technologies have survived; banned things are in the large genuinely<br>
dangerous, for all that I feel individuals should be allowed to take<br>
their own risks.<br>
<p>
Refutation?<br>
<p>
[AFAIK: As far as I know]<br>
