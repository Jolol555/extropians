Although I agree with your overall outlook James, can anyone argue that <br>
we have had a *gain* in biodiversity?  Over the years I've looked pretty <br>
hard for evidence in the literature of any new species coming into <br>
existence in the past 100 years. As far as I know, there is none. There <br>
is plenty of evidence of species lost on the other hand.<br>
<p>
Now weather this species loss is a good or bad thing is another question <br>
entirely.  There is plenty of evidence to show massive species lost in <br>
the past, yet life has kept going anyway.  The question here is, will <br>
the present species loss put our own lives in jeapordy?  Probably not, <br>
assuming any of the major nanotechnologies come to fruition in a <br>
reasonable time..<br>
