&lt; Alas, apart from Ander's pretty pathological case<br>
(open descension/ascension hierarchies, with<br>
persistance of the identity (is such a thing at all<br>
possible? -- I thought it was a function of<br>
rerecognizing agent history of _nonnegligeable_<br>
interactions)) there seems no positive return on such<br>
an investment. &gt;<br>
<p>
Forgive me, I've been reading too much Deleuze &amp;<br>
Guattari (lost in _A Thousand Plateaus_) and find<br>
oracles of bifurcation and destratification leading<br>
to singularity, as epitomized by the classic story of<br>
Oedipus Rex, somehow relevant for the possible<br>
Posthuman Child's blind relationship to His human<br>
parents.<br>
<p>
As for "open descension/ascension hierarchies, with<br>
persistance of the identity", on top of Davin's post<br>
describing our reliance on the subhuman critters and<br>
multiplicities within and without, this sounds<br>
somewhat like "The Machine at the Heart of Desire:<br>
Felix Guattari's Molecular Revolution" see <br>

Better yet, glance at this bit of inspired<br>
gobbledygoop for a burst of what I'm bubbling about:<br>
<p>
&lt; Thought is molecular and olfactory. Thought is the<br>
absorption, penetration, filtration, and<br>
configuration of particles and molecular chains<br>
appropriated from the surrounds. [CUT] Somewhere in<br>
our history we began to emphasize the secondary five<br>
senses as if they were primary. This was a step of<br>
alienation, as it created a sense of distance between<br>
ourselves and the world, when in fact all perception<br>
is molecular and we are literally homeopathically<br>
bathed in the world on a constant basis. We are in<br>
chemical communion with the surrounds. [CUT]<br>
Essentially the brain is a networked, highly<br>
differentiate, and electronically accessible storage<br>
center of various chemicals; in other words, the<br>
brain is not an electronic computer, but a<br>
macro-gland that is electronically stimulated to<br>
allow the rest of the body through the nerves to<br>
activate molecular memories and assemblages. In other<br>
words, the viscera runs the brain and not vice-versa.<br>
The brain is not the master control center, but a<br>
preservation garden of pheremonal biodiversity, a<br>
fabricked museum of scents. &gt;<br>
<p>
There's much more about the "ongoing battle between<br>
light and scent" between "exclusive, bounded entities<br>
in nonsimultaneous relations and arrangements" and<br>
how "the sensicality of the molecular realm is<br>
catalytical rather than logical" in this essay, "A<br>
Deleuzional Pheremonal Hypothesis", at<br>

<p>
To try and veer this back toward "Intra-Entity<br>
Ethics" (especially in light of your Long Now URL for<br>
Danny Hillis's essays), here's the conclusion from a<br>
book review that didn't make the cut for EO 1.0:<br>
<p>
&lt; George Dyson leads up to the end of DARWIN AMONG<br>
THE MACHINES by citing his namesake grandfather who<br>
developed modern grenade warfare while also being an<br>
accomplished musician. This leads into Connection<br>
Machines founder Danny Hillis's 1988 memetic fable<br>
about the coevolution of apes and song.<br>
<p>
The final chapter also presents the ancient fable of<br>
Roger Bacon's (13th century) Brass Head as a metaphor<br>
for the development of computers, AI and the global<br>
communications network: "we stand transfixed, like<br>
monkeys given a mirror, by the novelty of our own<br>
image reflected in the surface of the web. When the<br>
smoke clears and the master wakes, the computer as<br>
disembodied head will have disappeared, replaced by a<br>
diffuse tissue enveloping us in nebulous bits of<br>
meaning, as neurons are enveloped in electrolyte by<br>
the brain". &gt;<br>
