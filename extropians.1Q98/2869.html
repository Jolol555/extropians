<p>
Because that ordinary naked man is surrounded by goons, he is different<br>
from you and me.<br>
<p>
The words "president" and "emperor" are job-titles for leaders of<br>
particular types of gangs.  If I say so-and-so is a Grand Dragon of the<br>
Ku Klux Klan, does that mean I buy into the Klan's racist memes?<br>
<p>
When the FBI - excuse me, a certain set of terrocrats who call<br>
themselves "FBI" - gave a certain other terrorist the title "Unabomber",<br>
what did that imply about their memes?<br>
<p>
If a certain "clever, lying trickster" has power to interfere with my<br>
life in ways that other "clever, lying tricksters" cannot, it seems to<br>
me that's sufficient reason to give him a distinctive label.<br>
<p>
(As if "trickster" isn't itself a special label!)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Did you read the story of the "Two Tribes"</i><br>

<p>
I skipped over it on the assumption that it's the same meaningless piece<br>
of drivel that has been posted before.<br>
