<p>
No criticism but, for once, Damien, you may have missed the key element at<br>
which I was pointing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  but the 'solution' seems</i><br>
<i>&gt;  inherent in the problem.  They're immortal.  They don't need to study</i><br>
<i>&gt;  history so much, because they're the ones who lived it.  I think this</i><br>
<i>&gt;  continuity of memory, presumably with high fidelity of public and one's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  own private recrods, could well offset the loss of other people's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  private information.  I think private decision information is much less</i><br>
<i>&gt;  important than people not knowing public information.</i><br>
<p>
History will continue to be important in a society of immortal individuals for<br>
two reasons: (1) The incompleteness of contemporary experience; and (2) The<br>
educational needs of later-spawned individuals.  A couple of examples may<br>
illustrate my first point.  Like many in my generation, I grew up with Winston<br>
Churchill's History of the Second World War as the foundation of my<br>
understanding of the events that served as the hinge of the 20th Century.  Due<br>
to the seeming authority of his personal role in the events he described and<br>
the undeniable power of his mastery of the language, Churchill's work molded<br>
our views of WWII.  Unfortunately, large parts of it were self-serving<br>
fiction.  After his death, people were willing to begin a full critique of his<br>
account.  Furthermore, the disclosure of the Enigma materials cast a<br>
completely different light on almost every strategic decision made by the<br>
Allies, including especially Churchill's.<br>
<p>
One of my own idols, Thomas Jefferson, provides another telling example on a<br>
more personal level.  During his life and in the generations immediately<br>
after, hagiography and counter-polemics of federalists and anti-federalists<br>
obscured a clear view of the real person of Jefferson.  One of Jefferson's<br>
most insightful comments, that "a man's letters provides the truest story of<br>
his life" has ultimately provided the key to a more accurate view of the<br>
private Jefferson which has, in turn, cast a more complete light on his public<br>
life and that of his contemporaries.  Fawn Brodie's biography of Jefferson<br>
(upon which the film "Jefferson in Paris" was largely based) would simply not<br>
have been possible without access to all of Jefferson's private correspondence<br>
and the letters of other people.  Although other factors (one of which you<br>
identify below) might offset the effect of mortality on such candor, as things<br>
have been up to now, it has been the death of the authors of such<br>
correspondence that has made it available to us.<br>
<p>
As for the second point, some individuals will continue to be truly newly-<br>
spawned, as opposed to branching threads on the same identity-tree.  For those<br>
entity-identities who come into being later, a knowledge of past events, i.e.<br>
history, will be just as important as it is now.  They will want an accurate<br>
account of a history to which they were not a party.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  And an economist might say other people could be offered money for their</i><br>
<i>&gt;  perspectives.  First-hand historical consultants.</i><br>
<p>
This may well end up having to take the place of the "mortality effect" on<br>
historical candor.  I'm thinking of how Robert McNamara has in recent years<br>
made a cottage industry out of revealing his own private knowledge on the<br>
Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War.  Of course, one reason he has been<br>
able to do this is that his bosses at the time are now dead.<br>

<i>&gt;  &gt; I wonder what other factors we might look to to offset the negative</i><br>
impact<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; immortality may have on historiography?  What might the long-term effect </i><br>
<i>&gt; of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; this restriction on the historical record be?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Excellent Question....</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  How about declaring (and legally so) that the duration of any</i><br>
<i>&gt;  information is limited to a period of say, 50 or 75 years.  When a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  person is revived, a backup copy is made, which can be examined by</i><br>
<i>&gt;  anyone after this time interval. This includes upload conversion and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  complete interviewing of the upload. Also, it might be mandated that all</i><br>
<i>&gt;  persons who are immortal must make a backup copy, subject to the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;  rules, at intervals of 25 - 50 years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  How to implement this is indeed a thorny problem. One way might to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  provide a financial incentive for making such backups and later sell the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  information they contain. I consider myself (when revived) a living</i><br>
<i>&gt;  antique anyway, and my memories may well be my only salable assets...</i><br>
<p>
The seminars McNamara has organized about the Cold War seem to be a good<br>
example for how this might work.  They serve as good marketing devices for the<br>
memoirs of the participants.  Perhaps disclosures by one key actor might end<br>
up triggering counter-disclosures.  Naturally, I would be loathe to legislate<br>
a "sunset" for all privacy, but limitations periods on specific causes of<br>
action at law might well serve the same purpose.<br>

<i>&gt;  An adjustment in one's thinking and reactions to being "exposed" would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  deemphasize the affects of disclosure on one's privacy.  The longer we</i><br>
live,<br>
<i>&gt;  the less affected we are by the consequences of our behavior -- in part due</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to the fading of memory and also, and importantly, due to the gains in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  wisdom from life experiences.</i><br>
<p>
I wonder whether we might not experience a new tension between personal growth<br>
and development and reluctance to disclose the "sins" of one's youth ("ahh,<br>
what a fool I was when I was a youth, a mere 200-year-old!)  For people in<br>
"public life", it may be, as I describe above, that the desire to tell one's<br>
own personal private story will trigger more or less full disclosure by most<br>
of the participants in matters of wide concern.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Historical recordations might rely on computers rather than author or actor</i><br>
<i>&gt;  for information gathering.  Certainly, there could be on/off switches</i><br>
<i>&gt;  editing out crucial facts, but will we care to edit events out when we</i><br>
<i>&gt;  become more confident about our actions and less embarrassed by our pasts? </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The methodology of  historical research and presentation itself may change.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  When time is not categorized by events such as wars or disease, it will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  recorded by other types of events -- the events of merit in our posthuman </i><br>
<i>&gt; years.</i><br>
<p>
These are good points, and ones I believe will be fascinating to watch unfold.<br>
The sheer DENSITY of the historical record is growing exponentially, as data<br>
collection and mass storage technologies advance.  I have pondered without<br>
much insight the problems such a massive record will present to future<br>
historians.  Instead of the challenge historians of most eras of the human<br>
story have faced in the past, that of a too-small record requiring deductions<br>
and interpolations based on largely theoretical mental constructs, future<br>
historians will have the contrary problem of SELECTION from a perhaps too-rich<br>
record, requiring the guidance of actors at the time.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Time itself will become abstracted. Our minds tend to still frames of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;  own historical importance in our memories - one to the next - just as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  news broadcasts leading stories.  Our emotions are tied into these images</i><br>
<i>&gt;  very tightly.  As we live longer and longer, we will have less and less</i><br>
need<br>
<i>&gt;  to be emotionally tied to our own leading stories.  We may begin to enjoy</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the pauses inbetween.  These pauses might become years and even centuries</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt;  living with no featured "historical event" occurring.  (Much like working</i><br>
in<br>
<i>&gt;  the garden, absorbed in the act of life.)  Events such as reaching another</i><br>
<i>&gt;  galaxy or designing a new species might be historical events to be</i><br>
recorded,<br>
<i>&gt;  and perhaps the technology producing the events might be the author also.</i><br>
<p>
More good points.  An immortal's conception of time will surely be very, very<br>
different.  One of the fundamental heuristics of current historiography is the<br>
"generation", a valid concept in many ways because the actors in one age<br>
simply aren't the same actors in another.  With all of the difficult questions<br>
of personal identity raised by constantly evolving but persisting individuals,<br>
such a simple concept as the generation will become less and less relevant.<br>
