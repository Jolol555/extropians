Yes, I know (at least in Holland anyway). This is a major flaw of our justice<br>
system. People are paranoia about cameras here because they're supposed<br>
to "infringe their freedom", but at the same time they let all kinds of other<br>
freedoms be taken away from them without a murmur. Ah well &lt;sigh&gt;.<br>
<p>
Anyway, you could still use the evidence for blackmail or revenge, to convince<br>
friends and family and lots of other things (sell it to Candid Camera). And<br>
I suppose in some parts of the USA/world it *would* be allowed as evidence.<br>
<p>
I saw a real case on TV once where a guy in America wanted to file a (bogus)<br>
abuse (!) claim against his wife, and he used an audio recording with a<br>
lot of screaming and him yelling "don't hurt me" etc. as "evidence". His <br>
wife was bit smarter though, and had secretly videotaped the entire incident.<br>
The man's claimes were duly dismissed, and the video that makes him<br>
looks like an ass (yelling "don't hit me" while his wife is some three metres<br>
away and doing nothing offensive) is still in circulation in the real-TV scene.<br>
Serves him right.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;When in dangerous areas (like the USA), wear a kevlar vest as often as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;possible. It may not be a force field, but it can prevent some nasty</i><br>
<i>&gt; injuries.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you walk into a meeting and everybody takes of their jacket you're going</i><br>
<i>&gt; to look pretty foolish wearing a bulletproof vest, microphones and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; firearm on your body. </i><br>
<p>
Some of the lighter ("city") models can be discretely worn under your clothing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It would make many customers itchy and might severly</i><br>
<i>&gt; hamper your job-opportunities (I make no judgement if this is justified,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but most companies have a rule that says 'No guns in the office' or</i><br>
<i>&gt; something).</i><br>
<p>
Well, it makes kind of sense. Stun guns and mace should be allowed<br>
anywhere though. That should nip many sexual harassment cases in<br>
the bud ;-)<br>
