<i> &gt;Back in the dim mists of pre-history (two weeks ago) Lee Daniel Crocker and</i><br>
<i> &gt;Arjen Kamphuis were discussing what to me seemed to be the merits of</i><br>
<i> &gt;philanthropy, "altruism" and "volunteer work" in the third world. For</i><br>
<i> &gt;instance, Arjen posited that "one has a moral responsibility to minimize</i><br>
human<br>
<i> &gt;suffering" and Lee wrote that "It would be a sin for you to throw away your</i><br>
<i> &gt;skills to go playing in the third world unless that's actually where your</i><br>
<i> &gt;skills are . . . [C]omparative advantage will put people where their skills</i><br>
<i> &gt;make the most difference--and therefore, money," making the point that most</i><br>
<i> &gt;volunteer work seemed to be little more than wasteful, ineffective gestures.</i><br>
<p>
I'll agree that the effectiveness of foreign aid may leave something to be<br>
desired (understatement), but saying that you should be in the place where<br>
you make the most money is (IMHO) a simplification. The amount of revenue<br>
generated primarily tells you something about how value is perceived by<br>
people who already have a very high standard of living and control over<br>
many resources.<br>
<p>
My customer may be willing to pay an enourmous amount for an advice that is<br>
sometimes simply common sense (IMO), while getting finance for low-tech<br>
improvements that can save several lives per year in a small community can<br>
be very hard. By reducing the problem to a purely economic one you are<br>
saying that $10.000 spent on preventing some manager looking foolish in<br>
front of his peers is somehow better than half that ammount spent on basic<br>
medicine simply because the manager is in a position to pay and most<br>
Africans are not.<br>
<p>
I always was thought that judgements as to what is 'better' were way beyond<br>
the reach of economics.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The first</i><br>
<i> &gt;is "Unrugged Individualism: The Selfish Basis of Benevolence" by David</i><br>
Kelley<br>
<i> &gt;and the second (mentioned in another post by me this morning) is "How the</i><br>
Mind<br>
<i> &gt;Works" by Steven Pinker.</i><br>
<p>
 // snipped a lot of good writing //<br>
<p>
I'll have to get hold of those books somehow, and some time to read them ;-)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;This analysis bears out Lee's observations. Rendering aid to the starving</i><br>
may<br>
<i> &gt;be the "right" thing to do in a selfish way, but doing it in the most</i><br>
<i> &gt;EFFECTIVE way is also the most rational thing to do.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;A first-world kid who</i><br>
<i> &gt;has never wielded a hammer, floundering around trying to </i><br>
<i> &gt;build a school in Zambia, may well be a waste.</i><br>
<p>
Or it may be a very educational experience of a type 1st-world universities<br>
don't offer. Down in the mud you learn a lot about organizing projects and<br>
effecient usage of (very limited) resources. But most of all you can learn<br>
to keep yourself and others going under difficult circumstances.<br>
<p>
Most '1st-world kids' don't do the actual hammer wielding of course but<br>
contribute their western knowledge or academic skills (that is, if they are<br>
serious about their aid). The people living in third-world countries are<br>
perfectly capable of digging a canal, designing a integrated irrigation<br>
system however may be beyond their capabilities (not suprising since many<br>
of them never had the opportunity to master reading and writing).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;A skilled carpenter's donation of a season of</i><br>
<i> &gt;such work, though, may well be perfectly rational, as would </i><br>
<i> &gt;supporting that effort with a donation of capital by the first-world kid,</i><br>
<i> &gt;whose talents are more effectively employed as a computer programmer.</i><br>
<p>
I won't argue that the kid will become a better programmer through these<br>
kind of experiences but there's more to life than pumping C++ code. A<br>
change in environment, broadening her/his horizon might make for a<br>
stronger, self-sufficient and more balanced person. The effectiveness of an<br>
employee in the function of programmer is only partly due to his/her<br>
programming abilities, being able to teamwork and function under stress are<br>
just as important.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Employing this analysis, one can distinguish between empty gestures and</i><br>
<i> &gt;meaningful participation in a rational culture of benevolence.</i><br>
<p>
As long as we try to take 'the full picture' into account and not just the<br>
dollars that our bookkeepers can track down; Agreed ;-)<br>
