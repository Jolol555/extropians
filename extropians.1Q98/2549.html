<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason why I think developing sea based enclaves now is a good idea is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  is an excellent and low cost test bed/training center for long term</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  habitation/colonization in space. For example the figures I believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Clark contributed of supertanker costs indicates that these are relatively</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cheap.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  A couple tens of millions for a whole supertanker? wow.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, I think John was saying that he thought it might cost ten times the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; approximately $100 million figure I supplied to make a supertanker liveable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know if it would be that much, but the all-in cost of acquiring and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; converting a very large tanker would surely be more than $200 million and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; probably at least $300 million.  To my subjective sense of economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; proportion, this seems like such a high threshold of investment that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; benefits offered by such an extra-national enclave would have to be VERY great</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; in comparison to continuing a business within the confines of existing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; national territories.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I was talking with a freind of mine today who is an oil wildcatter. He said that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the reason tankers are in such demand today isn't for their transportation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; capability, but merely for their storeage capacity, due to the present glut</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; overextending the present capacity of land based storeage for crude. He said that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a short three day war in Iraq would completely dry up this glut, and send tanker</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; prices down again.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So you're suggesting that we wait until there's a week-long war in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the mideast, then invest in firms that own &amp; rent out tankers?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
A possibility, or if funds are available, wait til prices crash to buy several tankers,<br>
then sell all but one when prices stabilize. Utilizing commodity price behavior to<br>
discount your own final cost is just good sense. I did that with RAM, when 16 meg stick<br>
prices crashed to $15 ea a month or so ago, I bought 480 megs. When prices doubled a<br>
week later, I sold them all, but 4 sticks, which I got for free plus some profit.<br>
