<i>&gt;  //snipped// some remarks about the functioning of US political system</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; (ROTFL slightly wondering who _He_ is banging this week :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;In a century where europeans and asians heralded the end of the age of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;the individual, and the advent of the collective,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; ???</i><br>
<i>&gt; You won't find religious fanatics blocking woman's clinics in europe, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; only in the US that groups of people are allowed to try to violate such</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual rights.</i><br>
<p>
Touche, and correctly so. However, we don't have legalized confiscation to the<br>
same level as most european govts either, and most people here don't see such<br>
confiscation as a social responsibility, more as a crime.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;We have successfully purged the welfare state from our</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;federal system, and most of our state governments.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Did you know that the US is one of the few 1st world countries in the world</i><br>
<i>&gt; were parkinson's disease is significantly lower among blacks and other</i><br>
<i>&gt; minority groups? Regrettably this is not because blacks in the US don't get</i><br>
<i>&gt; parkinson, it is because often they don't get treated and thus do not show</i><br>
<i>&gt; up in the statistics. Quite a feat for the most powerful mation in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world today.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, in asking my mother, who is a Quality Improvement Coordinator at a<br>
hosipital here, she says that the reason it is lower in other minority groups is<br>
that whites get the most health care, which causes them in old age to have the<br>
most concurrent medical prescriptions. Conflicts between medications is the<br>
largest cause of Parkinson's. It stands to logic that if a minority has less<br>
access to health care that they would be less likely to have medication<br>
conflicts, ergo, less chance of getting Parkinson's.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Other nations that have followed suit now enjoy stronger economies</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;than their stagnant socialist neighbors.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; We have been over this before but maybe it did not register or something,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the above sentence is abosulute and total B.S. (tough but that's what it is).</i><br>
<i>&gt; European countries with the most extensive welfare systems like Germany and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Netherlands are the strongest economies on the continent. And our</i><br>
<i>&gt; currency is a hell of a lot more stable than the US $.</i><br>
<p>
Stability is fine, however totally sacrificing growth in pursuit of stability and<br>
equity is not a viable long term policy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Instead of believing that a welfaresystem necessarily leads to economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; collapse or something why don't you prove it? And don't just use France or</i><br>
<i>&gt; some former East-block nations as an example. The fact that a welfare</i><br>
<i>&gt; system is impossible to implement in the US without all kinds of bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; side-effects only tells us something about US-society. The _fact_ that</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are countries in this world that have the combination of a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; healty economy and a extensive welfare system shows that it is possible,</i><br>
<i>&gt; given competent leadership, organisation and a sense mutual responsibility.</i><br>
<p>
The proof is in the recent behavior of most of these countries, as well as<br>
Canada. All of them have had in the last 5 years skyrocketing deficit<br>
projections, which they responded to by cutting back on social services and<br>
entitlements. The Canadian system has been cut back rather drastically, and at<br>
least 30% of the urban hospitals in that country have been shut down or are in<br>
the process of being shut down.<br>
<p>
A few years ago, Sweden, which US liberals love to tout as 'the most civilized<br>
country' or 'the most advanced country' with its total cradle to grave system<br>
that paid twice as much to unemployed persons as they could make in the private<br>
sector, went through a rather serious fiscal crisis. Perhaps Anders might know<br>
more detail on this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are more ways to Rome and we happen to like this one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The point is that the US has been good at technical innovation and</i><br>
<i>&gt; containment of aggressors. But that does not mean that US policy makers</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't learn from other countries. US drug policy is still very stupid and</i><br>
<i>&gt; outdated and _many_ US citizens are suffering because of this. Instead of</i><br>
<i>&gt; just saying that America is doing so great maybe it would be smart to</i><br>
<i>&gt; listen to others and learn from their succes stories.</i><br>
<p>
First off, I won't say that we are absolutely fabulous. Many of you here have<br>
seen what I have had to say in the past on many domestic issues here. However, I<br>
think that among major 1st world nations, and uniquely compared to previous<br>
contenders for the term 'superpower' in the past, the US has done IMHO, the best<br>
job of it so far. I also think that the US system has the most potential to<br>
change in the sort of directions amenable to extropy/transhumanism. The US isn't<br>
the be all and end all. That is agreed.<br>
