<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Is this what you believe to be 'rehabilitation?'</i><br>
<p>
A few kilowatts of electricity would put the brain of a serial murderer into <br>
a vastly improved state.<br>

<p>
<i>        &gt;I agree that there are, and will be, means of altering someone's         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;behaviour.  </i><br>
<p>
The Modern method of rehabilitation, taking a human monster who grew up in <br>
a bad environment and locking him into the most horrible environment on the <br>
planet crammed with other monsters for a decade or two, is not noted for <br>
producing marked improvements in character. These creatures need <br>
Nanotechnology to rewire their brains, however we don't have Nanotechnology<br>
yet, but we do have  super shock treatments.<br>

<i>        &gt;punishment for the purposes of prevention is not a legitimate tactic         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;in a world where criminals have no free will over their actions.  </i><br>
<p>
Why?<br>
             <br>
<i>        &gt;You seem to imply by this argument that there is some sort of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;equivalency between momentum and desires.  </i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
             <br>
<i>        &gt;Care to elucidate?         </i><br>
             <br>
Both effect the future state of a system.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You seem to believe that if I have a reason to do something, that is         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;some form of determinism.          </i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Reasons and causes are a few of the many factors that we consider         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;when we make decisions.  They do not (necessarily) force us to take         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;any particular path.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't know what you mean by "factors" but if you're rational it means you <br>
have other reasons why those reasons were not sufficient, it's not just a <br>
coincidence that the word "reason" means intelligence and also means cause.<br>
Without the slightest doubt, everything absolutely everything happens because <br>
of cause and effect OR it does not, and if it does not then it is by <br>
definition random.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;not being able to do things that we don't want to do is not really         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;seen as a limitation on our freedom, since those choices are        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;undesirable.  It does not alter the impression that we would still         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;be able to make those choices should we be so inclined.         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Obviously, but the point is that you're not so inclined so you can't make  <br>
those choices, and there are reasons for having that particular inclination.<br>
<p>
Of my own free will, I consciously decide to go to a restaurant. <br>
Why?    <br>
Because I want to.    <br>
Why?   <br>
Because I want to eat.   <br>
Why?   <br>
Because I'm hungry?    <br>
Why ?   <br>
Because lack of food triggered nerve impulses in my stomach , my brain <br>
interpreted these signals as pain, I can only stand so much before I try to  <br>
stop it.    <br>
Why?   <br>
Because I don't like pain.  <br>
Why?    <br>
Because that's the way my brain is constructed.    <br>
Why? <br>
Because my body and the hardware of my brain were made from the information   <br>
in my genetic code  (lets see, 6 billion base pairs 2 bits per base pair   <br>
8 bits per byte that comes out to about 1.5 geg, you could put it on a little <br>
700 meg hard disk with stacker)  the programming of my brain came from the  <br>
environment, add a little quantum randomness perhaps and of my own free will   <br>
I consciously decide to go to a restaurant.<br>
               <br>

<i>        &gt;Wouldn't you agree that most people believe that there is something         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;more to free will than the mere experience of it?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
When most people talk about free will they are not right or wrong, a burp is  <br>
not right or wrong either, it's just a noise.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If I were to have complete control over someone's actions by means         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of an ingenious remote control device which left them with the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;distinct impression that they were choosing their own actions, would         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;you accord that individual with the power of free will?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
30 years ago Dr. Jose Delgato of Yale University approached several people <br>
about to undergo brain surgery for medical reasons, and asked them if he <br>
could implant some electrodes in their brain at the same time. Some agreed. <br>
This experiment would be difficult or impossible to perform today without <br>
getting a lot of flack from self proclaimed ethics experts.  Even then he<br>
got into some trouble for doing it, and he got into  even more trouble for <br>
his excessive showmanship. For publicity he implanted an electrode into a <br>
bull's brain, got dressed up as a matador,  stepped into a ring with him, and <br>
stopped the bull in mid charge by remote control. The animal rights people <br>
were not amused.<br>
<p>
Anyway, he was able to experiment with people. In one case when the electrode <br>
was fired the man would always turn his head to the left. The interesting <br>
thing was that the man said he felt free,  he couldn't even tell when the <br>
electrode was turned on. The patient was always able to come up with good <br>
reasons for turning to the left. He would say "I'm looking for my slippers"<br>
or "I heard a noise" or "I was looking under the bed".  This man was <br>
intelligent and rational, he never said I'm looking for Martians, and felt <br>
perfectly free. In all cases he thought turning his head was his own idea, <br>
he felt free because he was, he was doing what he wanted to do.<br>
<p>
I think the man was perfectly correct when he said "I'm looking for my <br>
slippers" that's exactly what he was doing. Nobody could convince him that he <br>
didn't really want his slippers because he truly did, he just didn't <br>
understand why he wanted them.<br>
