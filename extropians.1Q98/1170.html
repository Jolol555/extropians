A very nice posting, it mirrors my views perfectly. I have never<br>
really liked the idea of farms in the first place (I'm a 100% city<br>
person - when I as a 5 year old was brought out into nature I<br>
immediately found a concrete slab to sit on :-). Of course, in order<br>
for hydroponics to become widely used it must be cheap and efficient<br>
enough. I wonder if it could be streamlined into a nearly<br>
self-sustaining system, driven by solar power with minimal<br>
requirements for human service.<br>

<i>&gt; When we</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the technology to do so, it will make more sense to carry out</i><br>
<i>&gt; agriculture right in the city, in tall buildings; layers and layers of</i><br>
<i>&gt; dense agricultural production.  Stacking the layers up, instead of only</i><br>
<i>&gt; using one layer as we do now, will mean we can produce more food using</i><br>
<i>&gt; less land space.</i><br>
<p>
Note that the buildings need to avoid shadow; this limits their use in<br>
many dense city settings. In many ways it is a situation similar to a<br>
forest, where trees compete for sunlight.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The human population could become quite large, indeed.  But how desirable</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a huge human population, one several times larger than the current</i><br>
<i>&gt; population?  Considering that nothing like it has ever happened before,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's very hard to predict what so many billions of people will do.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; will mean far more brilliant and hard-working geniuses than ever before. </i><br>
<i>&gt; And it may also mean far more psychopaths and criminals, but it also</i><br>
<i>&gt; means more people to stop them.  </i><br>
<p>
I think population density and culture are important factors<br>
here. Humans get stressed when the population density is too large,<br>
but this can be affected by cultural conditioning (compare Japan with<br>
Australia), and with some care we might design working societies even<br>
at very high densities. The problem is, as always, that even if<br>
something can be designed in principle it might not be implementable<br>
in practice. Most likely there is an upper limit to how densely we can<br>
build and retain our sanity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Any speculations on the results of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; population several times larger than the current one?</i><br>
<p>
Much will depend on how dense communications are. My guess is that<br>
eith enough humans even mass media will not be homogenizing enough,<br>
and mankind will diversify intensely into numerous incompatible<br>
cultures.<br>
