Sorry, I accidentally sent an empty message:<br>
<p>
I confused ctrl+x (send mail) and ctrl+c (cancel). I'd say that's<br>
a good example of "incomplete perception": hitting keys happens completely<br>
unconsciously - I just think "cancel" and (automatically) I hit ctrl+c<br>
and confirm the request (are you sure you want to cancel?) with yes. This<br>
happens too fast for reading the text, so the question (are you<br>
sure you want to send?) didn't even get to me... only after the message<br>
"message sent and saved..." (which remains on screen for a while) I <br>
realized my mistake.<br>
<p>
If I hadn't had that feedback, I would have just realized that after <br>
reading my own mail on the list - if I wasn't subscribed, I would have <br>
never realized that.<br>
<p>
I think one goal for individuals should be enhancing their perception as <br>
much as possible, both technologically and 'naturally'. The question is <br>
just: how far is it possible to "track" things down - without error.<br>
<p>
With "learned automatical behaviour" it's relatively easy: I just need to <br>
concentrate a bit more. Analyzing the first four circuits already needs <br>
some "knowledge" (about that particular model) + practice (like the <br>
exercises in Prometheus Rising). I think it's quite possible that with <br>
the right knowledge and practice, experiences on other circuits are as <br>
well possible - but I think it gets extremely hard to understand the <br>
"symbols" correctly:<br>
<p>
We don't know (yet), if - for example - precognition is just your mind <br>
playing a trick on you (possibly trying to make understand something), or <br>
if it's a clear sign that time is not "real" after all, do we?<br>
<p>
later,<br>
