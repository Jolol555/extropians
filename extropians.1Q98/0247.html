<i>&gt; Let's extrapolate from the narrow case a bit: what other</i><br>
<i>&gt; body mods would be useful in minimizing the kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; catastrophic damage that we want to avoid most (i.e.,</i><br>
<i>&gt; loss of memory/cognitive function)?</i><br>
<p>
One thing that I would like is some reserve circulation for the<br>
brain. Not sure how to implement it without hypotech, but its goal<br>
would be to sustain cranial circulation and avoid ischemia as long as<br>
possible. <br>
<p>
An ICP/blood pressure/oxygenation monitor would ge a great start. A<br>
fairly simple (well, none of these devices are simple by today's<br>
standards :-( ) possibility would be an autoinjector linked to the<br>
monitor system, so if you went into a unhealthy state it could release<br>
anti-ischemic drugs, antidotes to detected poisons or other useful<br>
chemicals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So having a builtin ICP monitor, blood pressure monitor,</i><br>
<i>&gt; heart monitor, respiration monitor and some other basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; stuff might be most helpful, especially if they were</i><br>
<i>&gt; tied to a warning system that, say, called 911 when the</i><br>
<i>&gt; heart stopped or brain pressure went over threshhold.</i><br>
<p>
That would be extremely useful. Pressure monitors can likely be made<br>
fairly easily, what we really would like is an oxygenation monitor. I<br>
saw a pacemaker last year that had a prototype for this, a small<br>
optical device that measured oxygen inside the heart, but according to<br>
its developer it wasn't that good. More work is needed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps we could build some standard sensors with skin-</i><br>
<i>&gt; mounted transducers that could be plugged into a cheap</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fluke meter at home to monitor as many signs as were</i><br>
<i>&gt; needed (diabetics would have glucose meters, etc.)  Is</i><br>
<i>&gt; there an existing technology for internal devices with</i><br>
<i>&gt; external electrical contacts that doesn't have too many</i><br>
<i>&gt; of its own problems?</i><br>
<p>
I haven't looked into this field much, but it seems to be fairly<br>
standard to supply power and some information to implants using<br>
transducers (cf. the anti-epilepsy "vagus pacemaker" mentioned here<br>
earlier; I really wonder how *that* stimulation feels!). This would<br>
likely be enough to signal to a device worn in the breast pocket or on<br>
the wrist.<br>
<p>
A neater solution might use infrared light through the skin. <br>
