If you're not buying and selling lots of the same product, you don't<br>
even need a currency.  If <br>
everything that exists is free, then only thing you could possibly<br>
want is something that does not <br>
exist.  Thus, by adding a little creativity into the mix it's more<br>
likely to get invented - the <br>
commodity is the currency.<br>
