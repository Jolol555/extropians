While I agree that the kind of absent-minded foresight exhibited by Tithonus<br>
dominates the thinking of most people when they are formulating their opinions<br>
on immortality, I believe there are some fairly sophisticated concerns about<br>
the idea of immortal humans.  The most obvious question is what effect would<br>
immortality have on human society?  Some effects would appear evident but I'm<br>
not so sure.<br>
<p>
Immortality would:<br>
<p>
"be the downfall of religions":  I think this underestimates the concept of<br>
religions and the grip they have on the general populace.  Religions do more<br>
than just offer a solace from that "death thing".  Religions give people a way<br>
to get along in an otherwise incompehensible (from their point-of-view)<br>
universe.  In my opinion, religions are also some of the most powerful memes in<br>
existence and "mere" immortality would not spell their end.  It would be more<br>
interesting to speculate what the effect immortality would have on the<br>
evolution of memes.  Immortality might intensify the competition between memes<br>
since they could no longer rely on the historical amnesia of ephemeral humans<br>
to forget problematic pasts.<br>
<p>
"allow humans to achieve higher levels of understanding of the universe around<br>
them":  I'm not sure about this one either.  Aged people are not necessarily<br>
more enlightened than younger people.  Most revolutionary concepts are born in<br>
the minds of the young not the old.  Older people are considered "wiser" but<br>
not necessarily "enlightened".<br>
<p>
I'm not a memory expert but without memory augmentation, immortality might not<br>
be a big advantage.  To the extent that our memories and experiences (to the<br>
extent we can recall them) represent who we are and how we relate to our<br>
external surroundings, immortality would only benefit it us to the extent that<br>
it allowed people to utilize the memory capacity of the brain to its maximum.<br>
<p>
Additionally, old people are generally rigid in their beliefs and outlooks.<br>
Perhaps they've tried lots of lifestyles but eventually they settle on a few<br>
beliefs and they become very set in their ways.  Imagine trying to change the<br>
mind of a 400 year old codger.<br>
