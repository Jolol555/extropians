Second, what about the Gateses of the past?  Microsoft is not the<br>
first startup to sweep through an industry and leave the old elite<br>
and others panting.  Ford nealy had a monopoly on cars.  Have<br>
you driven a Ford lately?  Most people don't today.  Was it the<br>
government that worked some magic to make other car companies<br>
compete?  No.  In fact, tariffs and import quotas help to keep Ford's<br>
competitors out, but yet it moves.  Honda, Toyota, Chrysler, etc.<br>
all make cars and compete with Ford.<br>
<p>
Third, the personal computer software market is relatively new.  As it<br>
matures, not only do I think more competitors will break into it, but<br>
consumers will demand more of an OS.  Maybe this will be more<br>
than Gates and Microsoft can deliver.  If so, competitors will eat<br>
his company alive.  If not, then perhaps it is because he is giving<br>
the people what they want.<br>

My Response::<br>
<p>
There is *no* historical prescedent like Bill Gates. His control is much <br>
deeper and more fundamental than that.   Bill Gates does not have <br>
control over just an industry like automobiles.  He is beginning to have <br>
control over ALL INFORMATION ITSELF; the very fabric of our new economy. <br>
This would be equivalanent to Morgan or Ford having control over most of <br>
industrial processes themselves; both horizontally and vertically.  In <br>
other words you wouldn't even be able to invent the airplane, because <br>
every industrial process in doing so, would be owned and controlled by <br>
ONE person.<br>
<p>
That is the irony!  The Information revolution is fundamentally <br>
different than the Industrial revolution in that it is more fundamental <br>
to how our whole socio-economic system functions.  And in turn allows <br>
less people to have more control over the whole process.<br>
<p>
This whole browser war is a perfect case of how Bill can control and <br>
crush anyone he finds a threat.  If anyone thinks that a few intelligent <br>
and business savvy individuals can bring him down I am all ears, because <br>
I think it is becoming increasingly impossible (i.e Netscape, Sun, and a <br>
1000 other corpses left dying on Bill's information hwy) to do so.  If <br>
Bill Gates is not stopped now, it will too late.  In a thousand years, <br>
the late 20 and 21st centuries will be known as the Gates Dynasty!<br>
