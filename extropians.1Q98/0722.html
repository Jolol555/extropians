True. But I'm becoming a bit worried about the prevalence of<br>
conspiracy thinking; it is alsmot the secular religion of the 90's. I<br>
almost daily hear people explain things in the world around them by<br>
references to conspiracies, and it seems to be the favored rhetorical<br>
tool for anybody outside the direct political mainstream (sometimes in<br>
it too) to explain the situation by some form of conspiracy (ranging<br>
from the patriarchal to the statist to the market conspiracy).<br>
<p>
To me this is a sign of sloppy thinking. Sure, there are dirty<br>
dealings and secret alliances out there, but that doesn't give<br>
conspiracy theories explanatory power. A conspiracy theory usually<br>
works by showing some suggestive but weak evidence, and then<br>
explaining away the lack of confirmation by cover-up. It is<br>
unfalsifiable ("Of course there are no witnessess, they have all been<br>
scared into silence"), defends itself vigorously from criticism ("See?<br>
They have indoctrinated you too!") and promotes spread (in order to<br>
help others see the truth). In short, they make very efficient memes,<br>
but they do not have to be true to spread well.<br>
<p>
Keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out.<br>
