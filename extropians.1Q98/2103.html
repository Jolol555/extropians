Very well.  What interests me is the extent to which a general (in fact,<br>
nearly ubiquitous) lack of regard for nonhuman suffering plays a part in<br>
the memetic facilitation of other kinds of disregard.  Why else would<br>
justifications for racist, misogynist, and other unattractive behaviors so<br>
often make recourse to the trope of equating the object of their<br>
disrespect with an "animal"?  Is this move really one you have never<br>
encountered?  I'm not interested in insisting that drawing an ethical<br>
distinction between human and nonhuman animals has a *foundational* role<br>
in maintaining other social hatreds (tho' I do think that the ubiquity and<br>
absolutely underquestioned status of the distinction makes it sometimes<br>
appear improperly foundational), but I will say that it stands in a<br>
mutually reinforcing relation to these attitudes, and deserves to be<br>
interrogated for that reason alone.  Not to mention the obvious analog of<br>
the human/animal relation to the Power/mehum relation that set this<br>
discussion off in the first place (for me, at least). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Classifying the enemy with other entities which have no rights clearly</i><br>

<i>&gt; rights would only cause them to use different labels (slime, scum,</i><br>
<i>&gt; excrement, etc.)</i><br>
<p>
Possibly.  What is interesting about the classification "animal" (as<br>
opposed to say "shit") is that it is a being whose suffering registers<br>
simultaneously as *real* but as suffering that nonetheless *does not<br>
matter*.  Shit is not imagined to suffer in the first place.  This is a<br>
difference that makes a difference when the thing the classification is<br>
enabling is *making some body suffer* or *not minding when one realizes<br>
that they do*. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If the correctness of the animal classification were an important part</i><br>
<i>&gt; of maintaining hatred, I would expect to see some carefull arguments as</i><br>
<i>&gt; to why the classification was correct. As far as I can tell, such arguments</i><br>
<i>&gt; are much rarer than your world view would predict.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure that I see what you're asking for here.  Since it is part of<br>
the deeply ingrained common sense of many societies that there is a<br>
self-evident irrelevance about the suffering of the nonhuman, I don't know<br>
that I am particularly surprised to find that these assignments are made<br>
carelessly.  Best, Dale<br>
