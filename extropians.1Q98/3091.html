<i>&gt; &gt;Don't forget that some languages have masculine, feminine, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;neuter.  In German, for example, a teenage girl is neuter (obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;invented by a father with a good imagination and not much contact</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with reality).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't tell me. The German expression for "girl", "Maedchen", is indeed</i><br>
<i>&gt; neuter. Just one of many examples for repression of female sexuality even</i><br>
in<br>
<i>&gt; language.</i><br>
<p>
Hey, I happen to like neuter (not neutering!), so I'm feeling a little<br>
germanly repressed myself!  Give me a break, you could equally argue that<br>
girls are neuter because they transcend the distinction between male and<br>
female.  I don't think a language represses certain groups, it just lowers<br>
the efficiency of communication.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Where does the "wo" in "woman" actually come from?</i><br>
<p>
I always figured it was "womb" + "man", but no... it is from Old English<br>
"wifmon", meaning "wife man."   That sounds very accurate... in many places<br>
(and especially in ancient times) the line between men/women can be blurry,<br>
but the only consistent difference is that a man can marry a "wifmon," and<br>
of course, he cannot marry a regular "mon." (although rulings in Hawaii,<br>
etc. have changed this)<br>
