<i>&gt; From:          EvMick@aol.com</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In a message dated 98-01-30 22:45:05 EST, you write:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  That resource is creativity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  And to pay for creativity, another resource which can already be </i><br>
<i>&gt;  produced in very large quantities with essentially no resource input </i><br>
<i>&gt;  but which, it appears, we will also never have enough of:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  respect. &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some years ago James Hogan wrote a novel which addressed this concept.  I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; greatly impressed by it and think it has significant bearing on a MNT future.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If memory serves it was entitle "Voyage to Tommorow" or something similar. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The "currency" was respect and the commodity was creativity.  </i><br>
<p>
Interesting.   Amazon doesn't list that title but they do list <br>
"Voyage from Yesteryear".<br>
<p>
I had never previously, as far as I am aware, <br>
encountered these two things put together in a single work  (I had <br>
encountered creativity as the ultimate scarce resource, and respect <br>
as the ultimate payment, each seperately, more than once) .<br>
<p>
But we can certainly find examples of it.<br>
<p>
HOW do the members of the Linux community recognise needs for certain <br>
software and do good jobs of providing that software?<br>
<p>
Creativity.<br>
<p>
WHY do they choose to circulate that software, mostly for free?<br>
<p>
Respect and reciprocity.<br>
