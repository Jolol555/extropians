I pointed this out, but not as concisely. You only win if you use<br>
a non-solar power source to generate artificial light. You can use<br>
fossil fuels or nuclear power. This would be a horrible waste of<br>
fossil fuels: there is likely to be a better way to convert them to<br>
food. This leaves nuclear, which most people reject for emotional<br>
reasons.<br>
<p>
You can of course place your farms on top of the city and still capture<br>
the city's area of sunlight, but the city would be a pretty gloomy<br>
place if you did that.<br>
