<i>&gt; I think this was more than a mere trick to avoid the singularity,</i><br>
<i>&gt; The author, seems to be against certain advances:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "We could implant intelligent machines in physical bodies like</i><br>
<i>&gt; ours, or some other higher life-forms. Hell, before you know it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we'll be advanced enough to create a wholw new species superior to</i><br>
<i>&gt; ourselves. Sure we could do that, but why would we? Then we'd have</i><br>
<i>&gt; created a hyperintelligent competitive species. Such an act would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be insane: would have a wholly unpredictable outcome. It would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; as mad as a full-scale nuclear exchange in the 1980's so I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; expect it, even in light of todays crisis." (page 303)</i><br>
<p>
(Of course, you can't always assume that the author's views are the same<br>
as his characters.  But in this case you may be right.)<br>
<p>
Actually there are many people who would seem to be quite sane,<br>
even Extropian, who would not see it in these terms.  Hans Moravec<br>
views computers as "mind children", as much our offspring as those of<br>
flesh and blood.  Who would not want their children to exceed their own<br>
capabilities?  Are we supposed to jealously prevent them from taking on<br>
new powers because they would go beyond us?<br>
<p>
In Halperin's novel, by the end, people have some pretty amazing<br>
capabilities.  I think most people would view this as hopeful and<br>
positive even if they personally don't expect to survive to that era.<br>
Does it really make so much difference if our children are made of<br>
silicon and steel?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'm a little skeptical about this, having seen many efforts fail</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in the past which were going to change the future of cryonics. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;For example, Omni magazine had a reasonably well promoted contest</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;where the prize was "immortality" - a cryonic suspension contract</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with Alcor.  This was a big jump into the mainstream, especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with the idea of cryonics as a prize, a reward, not some kooky</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;perversion.  However it was not much of a success; there weren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;many entries, and I think most people were just not ready for it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if WIRED were to try the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing today?</i><br>
<p>
Good question.  My gut says the same thing would happen - cryonics<br>
is not much more popular today than it was a few years ago during the<br>
Omni contest.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I thought Halperin's novel was most effective in depicting a 21st</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;century where we'd like to live, and where technology really does</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;advance to the point where it solves many of our most difficult</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;problems.  I was uncomfortable when it took on a scolding tone,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;shaking its head over how blind people were in the late 20th</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;century not to sign up for cryonics. This reminds me too much of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a temperance tract regaling us with the evils of Demon Alcohol.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I didn't see this as a scolding, it made me a little sad, and more</i><br>
<i>&gt; determined than ever to sign up. In my own case this novel</i><br>
<i>&gt; solidified my reasoning on the issue.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but the mere fact that you are seriously considering signing up for<br>
cryonics puts you in a tiny, tiny minority.  The question is, how will<br>
a person react who shares the common view that cryonics is a spooky cult?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, vision in the "retrospectroscope" is always 20/20, but I</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought he accomplished this quite well. In a world where cryonics</i><br>
<i>&gt; has proven to work, those who didn't see the possibility will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; seen as lacking vision.</i><br>
<p>
This is possible.  We see this to some extent with medical advances,<br>
where some "obvious" innovations were slow to catch on - things like<br>
washing hands between patients, or the use of anesthetics during surgery.<br>
It is tragic that there was so much unnecessary pain and death.  I don't<br>
think we really feel angry or disappointed with the human weaknesses and<br>
limitations which caused those problems, though.  More, we feel compassion<br>
and pity for the hard lives which people had to struggle through in those<br>
days, and gratitude that we live in a more enlightened age.  Do you agree?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think when this is widebanded as a T.V. miniseries, this could</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a big effect.</i><br>
<p>
It will be great if it does.  I don't have a sense of how mainstream<br>
SF readers will be responding, though.  The reviews on amazon.com are<br>
very favorable, but I saw a lot of names I recognized as being part of<br>
the extropian/cryonicist community.  Hopefully it will be equally well<br>
received by the larger audience.  I enjoyed it a great deal, but it<br>
touches closely on those areas in which I am most different from other<br>
people, so I really don't know how it will go.<br>
