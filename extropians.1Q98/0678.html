Also we should keep working on our local media to cover these<br>
issues better. Here in Atlanta today the local major paper<br>
buried the telomerase story way back in D6! Personally I<br>
think it should have been front page news (which they did<br>
with cloning BTW) and I dropped them a note to say so. They<br>
haven't even mentioned this whole Euro cloning ban thing<br>
either.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Okay.  I have a few quibbles here and there, but the main question, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; question I keep returning to, is this:  What makes the organization you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are outlining here *extropian* rather than just fairly conventionally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; American libertarian?  Your claim seems to be that the best preparation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for the technological future extropians anticipate is to spread as widely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as possible a respect for rights and liberty in their libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; formulations.  This is arguable, and I wouldn't mind seeing the arguments</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; so long as they didn't veer too much into Basics.  But the thing that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; most relevant to the topic at hand is that the organization you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; outlining would be pretty indistinguishable from a libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; organization and I can't see why it wouldn't represent an unecessary</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; duplication of services.  Is there a uniquely *extropian* agenda and space</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of activism that remains to be filled, one that might actually deserve the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; moniker "the extropian *movement*"?  Best, Dale</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   I understand, and I can see what you mean. Its always good to start with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; more narrow focus, I guess I just wanted to make sure that this concept was</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered the backbone, that which is in need of little debate or waste of</i><br>
<i>&gt; bandwidth. Based on this, we should engage in legal cases where clear issues</i><br>
<i>&gt; of infringement of rights to use technology are infringed. I agree that while</i><br>
<i>&gt; what I originally was proposing just sounded like Libertarian Party II, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to put a more narrow focus on to emphasisze the technological aspects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that the present cloning thing we should really rally about, as its</i><br>
<i>&gt; really becoming a flash point. Things are getting WAY out of hand.  If we had</i><br>
<i>&gt; a program with "Harry &amp; Betty Smith" as the subjects, two ordinary people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't have healthy kids unless they clone, produced and put on one of the tv</i><br>
<i>&gt; news programs or some such, we could start to score points. Maybe get a couple</i><br>
<i>&gt; of religious nuts to say some really embarrassing things to illustrate who the</i><br>
<i>&gt; radicals really are.</i><br>
