<p>
That this is a positive thing is a matter of interpretation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;a democratic system </i><br>
same as above<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and it wisely</i><br>
<i>&gt; has kept the world's greatest language, English. Per capita GDP is low,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but improving slowly. Most people are still poor, but they are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; totally destitute and seem to be happy with their lives. </i><br>
<p>
That's a really funny statement.  "They seem like happy people, they tend<br>
to smile a lot"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; More people can</i><br>
<i>&gt; afford "luxury" items these days. The socialistic policies of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Congress Party have held the country back, but everyone except the far</i><br>
<i>&gt; left now agrees that more market liberalization is needed. Yes, you will</i><br>
<i>&gt; find many pitiful beggars in any Indian village or city, but the poverty</i><br>
<i>&gt; was far worse in the past. </i><br>
<p>
Since there are 900 million indians in a very large country, i really<br>
cannot beleive that you have an accurate assessment of the country by<br>
anecdotal accounts even if you live there (and much less if you've just<br>
visited or never placed a foot in the country).  Also, the population<br>
being so high, statistics lend themselves naturally for this kind of<br>
thing, and, as limited as GDP/capita, lifespan and literacy rates may be<br>
in informing about the general well-being of a country's population, they<br>
tend to give an approximate idea, especially if they are combined. So,<br>
what follows is somthing i've collected over the last hour (i would like<br>
to include more countries, but i don't have that much spare time):<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the '96 CIA factbook:</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Spanish colonies:<br>
Country		Lifespan	Literacy	GDP/capita<br>
<p>
Argentina	71.66		96.2%		8100<br>
Bolivia		59.81		83.1		2530<br>
Chile		74.49		95.2		8000<br>
Colombia	72.81		91.3		5300<br>
Costa Rica	75.72		94.8		5400<br>
Cuba		75.05		95.7		1300<br>
Dominican Rep	69.06		82.1		3400<br>
Ecuador		71.09		90.1		4100<br>
El Salvador	68.88		71.5		1950<br>
Guatemala	65.24		55.6		3300<br>
Honduras	68.42		72.7		1980<br>
Mexico		73.67		89.6		7700<br>
Nicaragua	65.72		65.7		1700<br>
Panama		73.92		90.8		5100<br>
Paraguay	73.84		92.1		3200<br>
Peru		69.13		88.7		3600<br>
Uruguay		74.94		97.3		7600<br>
Venezuela	72.09		91.1		9300<br>
<p>
<p>
English colonies:  (Michael Lorrey's list)<br>
<p>
<p>
Bangladesh	55.86		38.1		1130<br>
Belize		68.53		70.3		2750<br>
Burma		56.14		83.1		1000<br>
Egypt		61.43		51.4		2760<br>
India		59.71		52.0		1500<br>
Kenya		55.6		78.1		1300<br>
Pakistan	58.46		37.8		2100<br>
South Africa	59.47		81.8		4800<br>
Sri Lanka	72.35		90.2		3600<br>
(Ceylon)<br>
Zimbabwe	41.85		85		1620<br>
(Rhodesia)<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Again, taking into account the limitations of statistics like this, the<br>
differences are so enormous and consistent that my previous statement<br>
would have to be revised: not only do those english colonies not do better<br>
than the spanish colonies (haven't seen the french stats yet), they do<br>
much, much worse.  And if india is the light of anything, then the world<br>
is really screwed.<br>
