That doesn't mean the model of religion as disease is bad, merely that<br>
biological "disease" is a broad area, including both pathogenic and <br>
non-pathogenic diseases.  Also, those principles are just general, not<br>
absolute; rabies transmits quite well vertically, while nitrogen-fixing<br>
bacteria transmit only horizontally.  <br>
<p>
Certainly I'd agree that vertically-<br>
transmitting religions are in general much more benign than horizontally<br>
transmitting ones.  But some of the vertically-transmitting ones get<br>
involved in nasty religious wars (hardly benign); while there are plenty<br>
of fairly benign cults, especially here in California.  In this sense<br>
religious memetic disease closely resembles biological disease, so the<br>
proposed disease analogy is indeed quite apt.<br>
