Alexander Chislenko asks:<br>
<p>
"There are many substances that are known to affect one's energy level,<br>
mental acuity, mood, empathy, etc.  What about slightly more complex<br>
personality features, such as curiosity, sociability, assertiveness,<br>
willpower?   Are there any supplements that can safely and selectively<br>
affect these features?"<br>
<p>
I don't know if there are any supplements right now that affect the<br>
personality features mentioned.  However, since I am someone with Bipoar<br>
Disorder (manic-depression), I occasionally go into a hypomanic state of<br>
mind.  In a hypomanic state of mind, I feel much more curious, sociable,<br>
assertive, have much more confidence and willpower and have a quicker,<br>
more intelligent and creative mind.  The hypomanic state is common for<br>
people with Bipolar Disorder, and it is believed to be chemically induced<br>
and has a profound effect on the personality. <br>
<p>
Perhaps more research will reveal what chemicals in the brain are<br>
responsible for inducing the hypomanic state of mind.  Then perhaps a<br>
drug can be produced which induces the hypomanic state of mind in people.<br>
 I can see a lot of benefits here.<br>
