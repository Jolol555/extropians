<i>&gt;this and still be normal, functioning humans is insane.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In fact, breaking completely with commonly assumed notions (like</i><br>

<i>&gt;good definition of insanity.  From a mystical perspective desiring</i><br>
<i>&gt;a break with socially constructed reality can make sense, but from</i><br>
<i>&gt;a political and 'rational' perspective it's just absurd.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So... well, Victor, I do agree with you--anarchists need to at least</i><br>
<i>&gt;be in touch with their society enough to know what they're rebelling</i><br>
<i>&gt;against.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
The above list -- "identity, time, space, money, cause &amp; effect,<br>
logic, etc." -- does not contain any pemes -- neither shallow pemes<br>
nor deep pemes.  They're not specifically *political* memes.  They<br>
are very basic ontological/epistemological *memes* without which<br>
it would be difficult to function as human beings.  So, the use of<br>
these memes increases the power of all human beings.  They don't<br>
fall within the scope of my definitions:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Pemes are political memes.  They consist of ideas, concepts,</i><br>
<i>&gt;phrases, and terms, the use of which increases the power of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "masters" who operate coercive political systems; while</i><br>
<i>&gt;their use reduces the power of the "subjects" of coercive</i><br>
<i>&gt;political systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are surface pemes and deep pemes.  Surface pemes are</i><br>
<i>&gt;relatively easy to identify and invalidate.  An example of</i><br>
<i>&gt;a surface peme is "mandate from the people."  This is used</i><br>
<i>&gt;by politicians and bureaucrats to "justify" their coercive</i><br>
<i>&gt;actions.  It increases their power.  "Subjects" who accept</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "mandate from the people" peme, effectively reduce their</i><br>
<i>&gt;own power because they "authorize" politicians and bureaucrats</i><br>
<i>&gt;to take coercive actions against "subjects."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Deep pemes are much more difficult to identify as such and</i><br>
<i>&gt;to invalidate.  Deep pemes are generally accepted as valid</i><br>
<i>&gt;by practically all people, including freedom lovers.  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt;try to question, attack, or invalidate a deep peme, most</i><br>
<i>&gt;people will think you're crazy.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Two questions may help us identify pemes:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(1) Which words/concepts -- if I accept and use</i><br>
<i>&gt;them the way most people habitually do -- place</i><br>
<i>&gt;me at a disadvantage in relation to the political</i><br>
<i>&gt;"masters?"  (Which words tend to increase the power</i><br>
<i>&gt;of politicians and bureaucrats, while reducing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;power of their victims?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(2) Which words, if the political "masters" didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;have them nor any equivalents for them, would</i><br>
<i>&gt;dramatically reduce the power of politicians and</i><br>
<i>&gt;bureaucrats?</i><br>

<p>
I personally knew Hubbard.  As far as I know, he may<br>
have cleared a few surface pemes from his mind, but<br>
he never became aware of any deep pemes as such.  Most<br>
scientologists I've met are not politically freedom<br>
oriented -- Hubbard certainly wasn't.  I don't know of<br>
any scientologist who has cleared even one deep peme<br>
from his or her mind.  It's extremely unlikely that<br>
there's any process in "official Scientology" for<br>
eradicating pemes.<br>
<p>
Below, I illustrate the "basic peme creation mechanism."<br>
Many cult-like organizations use the same mechanism to<br>
gain control over their members.  Not having had any<br>
contact with "official Scientology" for more than 20<br>
years, I don't know whether they use this mechanism<br>
or not.<br>
<p>
Many scientologists have broken away from "official<br>
Scientology" and operate in what some of them call<br>
the "free zone."  They call themselves "free zoners."<br>
See &lt;<a href="http://fza.org/">http://fza.org/</a>&gt; and &lt;http://www.freezone.org/&gt;.<br>
<p>
One of my next steps will be to present the peme<br>
material to some free zoners.  Maybe we'll even<br>
develop some kind of "self-auditing process" to help<br>
people eliminate their deep pemes.  People need to<br>
be able to run this process on themselves without<br>
necessarily needing outside assistance.<br>

The Evolution of Pemes<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hmm. Ok, I guess my unstated assumption is that the most effective</i><br>
<i>&gt;political memes, probably those being referred to in this discussion</i><br>
<i>&gt;as "deep pemes", are likely closely related/connected to many of </i><br>
<i>&gt;"our" (those with a human genome) small-group instinctive tendancies. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This probably happens, according to my understanding, because they are </i><br>
<i>&gt;gradually evolved by largely blind trial and error, by what works and </i><br>
<i>&gt;what doesn't as the politically inclined cliques and hierarchists </i><br>
<i>&gt;gradually develop their skills and techniques at manipulating the rest </i><br>
<i>&gt;of us. As they try this incantation and that, they discover that some</i><br>
<i>&gt;words, symbols and phrases work better than others. It's my contention</i><br>
<i>&gt;that these are probably the "deep pemes," and are hard to dislodge</i><br>
<i>&gt;because what makes them effective is that they are associated with and </i><br>
<i>&gt;held in place by our small-group instincts -- or for that matter, other</i><br>
<i>&gt;instincts. BUT I believe there are many "social navigation" genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;tendancies which were selected by the process of evolution which shaped</i><br>
<i>&gt;our ancestors as "social animals," and that these are thus the most</i><br>
<i>&gt;likely anchors for these "pemes."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How about some speculation on the specific content of some of these</i><br>
<i>&gt;"pemes"/hijacked genes. I know Frederick has presented a general set </i><br>
<i>&gt;of "rules," but how about more specific content.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let me start this off by suggesting one of the strongest and most</i><br>
<i>&gt;over-used: "We must protect the children."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
"Protecting the children" is a surface peme more<br>
or less at the same level as "mandate from the<br>
people."  Most libertarians, anarchists, egoists,<br>
etc. have no problem recognizing surface pemes.<br>
<p>
Some peme rules:<br>
<p>
"6. Surface pemes shall induce mild soporific,<br>
stupefying, and debilitating effects in human<br>
brains.<br>
<p>
7. Deep pemes shall induce severe soporific,<br>
stupefying, and debilitating effects in human<br>
brains.<br>
<p>
8. Some humans shall attack and even expose<br>
certain surface pemes -- such as "national<br>
security," "public interest," "gun control,"<br>
etc. -- while others shall justify and defend<br>
these surface pemes.<br>
<p>
9. Under no circumstances shall any human be<br>
allowed to question, attack, or expose any deep<br>
pemes."<br>
<p>
<p>
The Basic Peme Creation Mechanism -- 'Two Tribes' Example<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Consider two different isolated tribes somewhere in the jungles of South<br>
America.  Call them Tribe 1 and Tribe 2.  Each has its unique language<br>
with its own structure.  The language of Tribe 1 (Language 1) tends to be<br>
very literal.  A man who fishes, for example, is called "man-who-fishes."<br>
The same man, while sleeping, is called "man-who-sleeps"; while talking,<br>
"man-who-talks"; while running, "man-who-runs"; while eating,<br>
man-who-eats"; while writing, "man-who-writes"; while making a chair,<br>
"man-who-makes-chair"; while giving orders, "man-who-gives-orders"; etc.<br>
In Language 1, distinctions are made between different kinds of words:<br>
"Thing-words," "Do-words," "How-words," "Story-words," "Funny-words,"<br>
"Order-words," "Panic-words," "What-words," "Who-words," "Why-words,"<br>
"When-words," "Where-words," etc.  High-level abstractions are rare in<br>
language 1.  To the people of Tribe 1, any word that doesn't refer to<br>
something physically perceivable, is highly suspect.  Their test for<br>
reality is *physical*.<br>
<p>
The language of Tribe 2 (Language 2) is very different.  A man who obtains<br>
his wherewithal mostly by fishing, is called "fisherman."  (This system of<br>
nomenclature would seem absurd to the people of Tribe 1 -- how can you<br>
call someone a "fisherman" when he is not fishing, but sleeping?)<br>
Language 2 contains many high-level abstractions -- like "happiness."<br>
People from Tribe 2 can talk for hours about "happiness."  (To someone<br>
from Tribe 1, this would be incomprehensible -- they only talk about<br>
"woman-who-is-happy" while she is happy, and "woman-who-is-sad" while<br>
she is sad.  The notion that you could separate "happiness" from a real<br>
person being happy, and talk about "happiness" as if it existed by itself,<br>
would be completely unthinkable to someone from Tribe 1.)<br>
<p>
To the people from Tribe 2, any word being used is automatically assumed<br>
to be part of existence, otherwise people wouldn't use it.  (To someone<br>
from Tribe 1, the word "existence" would be a meaningless absurdity,<br>
because in their mentality only particular objects exist.)  In Tribe 2,<br>
the test for reality is *agreement*.  If other people agree with a word<br>
and the way it seems to be used, then that word is automatically accepted<br>
as valid and useful.<br>
<p>
One day a strange man arrives at the place where the people of Tribe 1<br>
live.  They ask him: "Who you?"  He: "I King."  They: "Your name King?"<br>
He: "No; my name John."  They: "Why call self King if name John?"  He: "I<br>
special person, agent of God."  They: "You look different but not special;<br>
who God?"  He: "God creator of world."  They: "Where God?; How create<br>
world?"  He: "God everywhere; God all-powerful."  They: "How we see God?"<br>
He: "Can't see God."  They: "You speak crazy."  He: "No; I special; I show<br>
you."  Whereupon the stranger performs various tricks like apparently<br>
making objects appear and disappear.  They: "You clever man-who-tricks."<br>
He: "I special; I King."  They: "You speak funny; you clever John-who-tricks."<br>
He: "I King; my word law."  They: "What law? -- special word?"  He: "Yes;<br>
my word law -- you must obey."  They: "Ah!  You mean order-word!"  He:<br>
"Yes; I King; I make law."  They: "No; you speak order-word?"  He: "Yes;<br>
I special."  They: "What special? -- Anybody speak order-word?"  He:<br>
"You not understand."  They: "No."<br>
<p>
Eventually John-the-stranger gives up trying to convince the people of<br>
Tribe 1 that he has a "special status" and that his words are different<br>
from the words of anyone else -- so he leaves, to search for more gullible<br>
and impressionable victims elsewhere...<br>
<p>
For many days and nights he trudges through the jungle before discovering<br>
the people of Tribe 2.  They: "Who you?"  He: "I King."  They: "Your name<br>
King?"  He: "No, my name John."  They: "Why call self King if name John?"<br>
He: "I special person, agent of God."  They: "You look different; what<br>
God?"  He: "God creator of world."  They: Where God?; How create world?"<br>
He "God everywhere; God all-powerful."  They: "Show special?"  Whereupon<br>
the stranger performs various tricks like apparently making objects appear<br>
and disappear.  They: "You King, agent of God."  He: "Yes, my word law."<br>
They: "What law?"  He: "Law special word of God through me; you must<br>
obey."  Whereupon the people of Tribe 2 bow down and kiss the feet of John<br>
-- they do not habitually test abstractions against reality, so they<br>
readily accept John-the-stranger as their "King" and his word as "law."<br>
Thereafter all he has to do to subjugate, control, and dominate them, is<br>
open his mouth...<br>
<p>
"Language creates spooks that get into our heads and hypnotize us."<br>
<p>
-- Robert Anton Wilson , Introduction to 'The Tree of Lies'<br>
(by Christopher S. Hyatt. Ph.D.)<br>
<p>
The people from Tribe 1 reject the pemes of John the would-be-tyrant --<br>
making them impossible to subjugate, control, and dominate.  To them the<br>
would-be-tyrant is merely a clever liar and trickster.<br>
<p>
The Tribe 2 people accept John's word "King" to describe himself.  They<br>
believe that "King" John has special powers because of the tricks he<br>
performs and because of his supposed connection to "God."  By accepting<br>
John's pemes they automatically place him in a superior position and<br>
themselves in inferior positions.  Just by accepting, believing, and<br>
using the peme "King," they yield their power to the tyrant -- they<br>
subjugate themselves.<br>
<p>
It's worth emphasizing that just by accepting the pemes of the would-be<br>
tyrant, you place yourself at a huge disadvantage.  By doing so, you<br>
relinquish your power, enabling the would-be tyrant to become an actual<br>
tyrant.  Instead of laughing at his silly notions, you'll probably end<br>
up begging him to "change the law" so you can be free.  And guess who<br>
has the last laugh!<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The notion of being "personally powerless compared</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to the overwhelming power of "the state" or "the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; government"" is a near-surface peme many subject</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; themselves to needlessly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I thought I would share two anecdotes on this subject.  Last June, I had the</i><br>
<i>&gt;chance to visit part of the geographical region refered to as "The People's</i><br>
<i>&gt;Republic of China."  Before entering, I wondered what it would feel like</i><br>
being<br>
<i>&gt;in an area subject to people perpetraring "government" of the self-described</i><br>
<i>&gt;communist variety.  I had never been in an area before, subject to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;communist variety of government delusion.  I think many people who value</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom tend to regard such "governments" as the worst kind of "state."</i><br>
<i>&gt;During my visit, I found that I felt exactly like I do anywhere else I am.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The existenec of people who claimed to represent the so called "People's</i><br>
<i>&gt;Republic of China," didn't seem to cause me any problems during my trip.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My second anecdote takes me back to the late 80s, before i realized that "the</i><br>
<i>&gt;government" doesn't exist.  I was filling out a form purporting to be form</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;"federal government."  It asked me for some information which I realized that</i><br>
<i>&gt;some people who claimed to represent "the government" would use against me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The document stated that to give a false answer to the question would subject</i><br>
<i>&gt;me to a $10,000 fine or a $40,000 fine, I can't remember which, now, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;either one was scary enough.  So I did what most people do, I answered</i><br>
<i>&gt;truthfully and people who claimed to represent the "government" did use this</i><br>
<i>&gt;information to harm me.  Years later, I realized what a fool I had been.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;should have just lied.  I now realize there was virtually no way that thhe</i><br>
lie<br>
<i>&gt;could have been detected, without intensive investigation, which the issue</i><br>
<i>&gt;wasn't important enough to warrant.  I have suffered from this stupid</i><br>
<i>&gt;assistance I gave the "terrocrats" [coercive political agents or terrorist</i><br>
<i>&gt;bureaucrats] for 10 years now.  I have a plan that may enable me to undo</i><br>
<i>&gt;the effects one day, but it will cost me a lot and, so far, I don't have</i><br>
<i>&gt;the wealth to be able to afford it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One final point.  I have noticed, on several occassions, that police</i><br>
officers,<br>
<i>&gt;testifying in court, routinely lie.  Alan Derschawitz called this</i><br>
<i>&gt;"testilying."  When defending mysely in these "courts," I also lie in my</i><br>
<i>&gt;favor, as I don't think I owe these people the truth.  I have prevailed in</i><br>
<i>&gt;some minor traffic cases by lying.  Also, I have routinely passed polygraph</i><br>
<i>&gt;tests while lying.  So much for the accuracy of THAT device.  At the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;time, I am exceptionally honest with most people, who are not trying to harm</i><br>
<i>&gt;me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One of the things I enjoy doing is driving faster than the "authorities"</i><br>
<i>&gt;demand.  As this has been a long time pleasure for me, I have invested a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt;of time figuring out ways to get away with doing so, while suffering minimal</i><br>
<i>&gt;harm from people claimng to represent the "government."  When I was in high</i><br>
<i>&gt;school, a police officer came to speak to my driver's ed class.  I remember</i><br>
<i>&gt;him pointing out how few traffic patrol cops there were vs how many drivers,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and how low the odds were of getting enough tickets to lose your license.</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are so few of them and so many of us that it's neat how much you can</i><br>
get<br>
<i>&gt;away with, especially if you keep a low profile.  Basically, I find that I</i><br>
can<br>
<i>&gt;speed as much as I want, as long as I don't speed in front of any cops.</i><br>
