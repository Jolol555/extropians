But MPEG-2 is not the optimal compression method <br>

(Maybe it is the optimal method achievable with <br>
presently affordable hardware and software. )<br>
<p>
I had in mind the compression which results from the actions <br>
of the neural networks in the retina and the visual cortex. <br>
(Not only the compression achieved by methods like Delta Y-UV, <br>
discrete cosine transformation etc.. which are implemented in MPEG <br>
formats.)<br>
<p>
Furthermore the 50 gigabytes per day was just meant as an upper <br>
bound. Originally I estimated even less, but to be on the safe <br>
side I enlarged this number.<br>

I agree. The problem, ofcourse, is that inputs arrive even during <br>
the embryonic growth of the brain. However (theoretically) even <br>
these imputs could be simulated. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; how much information per unit of time do I need to </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; simulate the real life environment of a human individual </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in such a way that his brain will not notice the difference. </i><br>
<i>&gt;That makes 10 million axons of sensory information. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;normal activity for neurons lie beneath 1 KHz, so an upper bound on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the input would be 10 billion bits/s.</i><br>
When uncompressed...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; An information input of 50 gigabytes per day results </i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; human life time. </i><br>

<i>&gt;amplified in the brain, and it is from this we learn. Of course, we do</i><br>
<i>&gt;not have good figures of how much this is.</i><br>
I agree. <br>
But this way of estimating an upper bound was just a theoritical <br>
example! (The standard way, ofcourse, is to count the total <br>
number of synapses and the number of bits to describe their state.)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;My personal estimate for the human capacity is around a bit per</i><br>
<i>&gt;synapse (based on assumptions from neural networks), there are around</i><br>
<i>&gt;10^14 synapses, making a capacity of around 10^14 bits. </i><br>
And what about the information required to store which connection <br>
the synapses belong to. I.e which other neuron each dendrite is <br>
connected to.<br>

I assumed the neural network of the brain can be <br>
simulated by a deterministic system. (i.e. that a selfconsiousnes <br>
intelligence can be created by a deterministic system) <br>
This has ofcourse not been proven but seems quite likely. <br>
<p>
Some persons claim that some internal randomness should be <br>
inherent for generating selfconsiousness intelligence.<br>
However others claim that the random noise input from the <br>
environment is sufficent.<br>
<p>
That the human consiousness could be transferred to a<br>
deterministic system is unacceptable to some people <br>
because it kind of reduces themselves to machines...?<br>

<i>&gt; The question now is : how much is the total information</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;50 gigs/day is waaay too large. Some estimates are about 1 bit/sec</i><br>
<i>&gt;of non redundant information - a CDROM can hold a lifetime at this</i><br>
<i>&gt;data rate.</i><br>
The number of 50 gigs/day was just meant as an upper bound <br>
(a very rough upper bound).<br>
