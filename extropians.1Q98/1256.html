<p>
I would not have cheated on my spouse or led on someone who<br>
I should not take advantage of or lied about it or be a hypocrite<br>
(e.g., Clinton supports all manner of laws which restrict sexual<br>
contact between coworkers, yet it seems his personal policy <br>
that what is good for America can be set aside for him).  I see<br>
nothing wrong with holding people to standards of honesty<br>
and fidelity, or of condemning them when they not just fail but<br>
make such failure into a modus vivendi.<br>
<p>
BTW, Clinton did break the law if he advised Lewinski to lie<br>
under oath.  That is conspiracy to committ a felony.<br>
<p>
If he and Hillary had said from the start that they have an open<br>
marriage and the Bill likes to fool around, fine.  But this is not<br>
what he's done.  In fact, this goes against his professed<br>
beliefs.  Thus, it does not require adherence to any<br>
_antisexual_ moral code to see this as a character flaw.<br>
<p>
I really tried to remain outside this debate!:/<br>
