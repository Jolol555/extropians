<i>&gt; their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the</i><br>

<i>&gt; Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all</i><br>
<i>&gt; other Persons."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, where does that specifically mention slaves,</i><br>
<p>
What else can we infer from a contrast between "free Persons" and "other<br>
Persons"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; or say that they're</i><br>
<i>&gt; less than human? All it says is that the number of representatives and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the apportioning of taxes will be calculated by taking the number of</i><br>
<i>&gt; voters/tax-payers and a fraction of the number of non-voters.  ...</i><br>
<p>
Not exactly.  Remember, not all free Persons were voters -- indeed there<br>
are still at least two classes of free nonvoters: minors and resident<br>
aliens.  Even "illegal aliens" are counted (I believe this was decided<br>
in a suit over the census of 1980).<br>
<p>
A comparison with the Articles of Confederation is instructive.<br>
<p>
"Art. VIII. All charges of war, and all other expences that shall be<br>
incurred for the common defence or general welfare, and allowed by the<br>
united states in congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common<br>
treasury, which shall be supplied by the several states, in proportion<br>
to the value of all land within each state, granted to or surveyed for<br>
any Person, as such land and the buildings and improvements thereon<br>
shall be estimated according to such mode as the united states in<br>
congress assembled, shall from time to time direct and appoint.  The<br>
taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and levied by the<br>
authority and direction of the legislatures of the several states within<br>
the time agreed upon by the united states in congress assembled."<br>
<p>
Such a survey is obviously difficult and open to quarrels of<br>
interpretation, not to mention corruption.  So the Convention of 1787<br>
adopted population as a proxy for wealth, on the theory that free people<br>
will tend to migrate to where the wealth is.  And *then* they made<br>
representation in the Lower House proportional to taxation.<br>
<p>
Thus electoral equality came in through the side door.<br>
