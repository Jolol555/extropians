  IAN: I think that the words of James above <br>
  are beautiful! I think that they are so true <br>
  they reach to levels much more profoundly <br>
  deep that the surface upon which they rest.<br>
<p>
  BUT, even as I except them as true, in the <br>
  interest of truth inquiry, I have to question <br>
  if what they refer to is "bad." Why should we <br>
  not be subsumed into a collective entity? OK, <br>
  I can think of some reasons, but there may also <br>
  be a lot of reasons on the other side, such that <br>
  it may not be a 100% "bad" thing, but, like most <br>
  things, may be a fuzzy "good/bad" thing.<br>
<p>
  If we hold that the subsummation James posits is<br>
  100% bad, and thus individual entities should not<br>
  be unconsciously subsumed into larger entities,<br>
  then we individuals would not even exist, for the <br>
  individual ameba and primary cells should not have<br>
  been subsumed into the large collective entities <br>
  that each of us as human beings are.<br>
<p>
  So the subsuming of individuals into a collective <br>
  entity cannot be more frightful or "wrong" than our <br>
  existence as individual entities! So why then should <br>
  this admittedly "good thing" not extend on and on <br>
  to higher levels of collective entities?<br>
<p>
  I'm not advocating that "it should" or that "it <br>
  should not," I'm just asking the questions that <br>
  are necessary to the process of truth inquiry. <br>
<p>
<p>
  We might also ponder, the meanings of "being sub-<br>
  summed." I have a very collectivist view of the <br>
  free market. I think that the "invisible hand" is <br>
  the true collective entity. That the modulation<br>
  of commodity pricing by supply and demand is the <br>
  true form of socialism and what we call "socialism"<br>
  is properly defined as "anti-socialism." The true<br>
  collective entity is the sum of all the people,<br>
  which is the collective sum of consumer demand,<br>
  NOT the whim of a central planing office im-<br>
  possed by threat of violence onto society.<br>
  Such is the rape of the social entity!<br>
<p>
  Free-market capitalism = real socialism <br>
  Central planning = pseudo-socialism<br>
<p>
  So in that paradigm, the true collective is <br>
  voluntary, and the involuntary just a prison.<br>
<p>
