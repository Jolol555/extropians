I'm not so sure about those limited applications; cannabis is used to<br>
treat glaucoma, nausea (due to chemotherapy, for example) insomnia,<br>
anorexia, depression, epilepsy, pain in general and lots more.<br>
See also <a href="http://www.hyperreal.org/drugs/marijuana/medical/index.html">http://www.hyperreal.org/drugs/marijuana/medical/index.html</a> <br>
I think we need a lot more serious, unbiased studies to fully understand<br>
the potential (or lack of it) of this plant. In the present "war on drugs"<br>
climate, studies tend to be more political than scientific (God-weed vs<br>
Devil-weed).<br>
<p>
One thing is for sure though: cannabis can be great FUN! It enhances you in <br>
all aspects...your imagination explodes, music sounds absolutely heavenly, <br>
food has never tasted better, you feel euphoric &amp; energetic, it's a _potent_ <br>
aphrodisiac and more. Smoke (or better yet, vaporize) pot and feel...transhuman <br>
(or maybe even posthuman with some *really* good weed ;-) When used <br>
moderately none of the alleged negative side effects like memory loss or <br>
decreased motivation occur, as far as *I* can tell. Sure, some people get <br>
passive and incoherent from smoking pot, but they usually use it too often <br>
(several times a say) and didn't have much of a life to begin with. Pot<br>
won't turn a healthy, happy transhumanist into a demented zomby. On<br>
the contrary, it might give you that edge you need to solve a difficult<br>
problem etc. It would probably be a good thing if scientists would "lighten<br>
up" every now and then, the greatest breaktroughs are made when looking<br>
from a different perspective.<br>
<p>
Be sure to visit Amsterdam sometime ;-)<br>
