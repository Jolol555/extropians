Kathryn's response on 3/2 was great.<br>
<p>
To approximate the number of transhumans would be a very cumbersome task.<br>
There are literally thousands!  Many transhumans don't even know what the<br>
word means.  Counting the number of transhumanists is a little less time<br>
consuming - yet even here, it is difficult because what determines a<br>
transhumanist is an acknowledgement of transhumanism, and he/she or it<br>
doesn't have to agree with all aspects of transhumanism.  A person walking<br>
around with an implant is a transhuman, just as an astronaut is a transhuman<br>
- yet, these two individuals may not agree on immortality or ethics, thus<br>
not practicing transhumanists.<br>
<p>
Putting this aside, so far there are approximately 160 individuals who are<br>
Transhumanist Artists, who have contacted me, and are participants of<br>
Transhumanist Art and/or the Extropic Art Movement (which would make them<br>
transhumanists.)  <br>
