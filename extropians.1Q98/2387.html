Creation<br>
<p>
<p>
Love ruminates and illuminates<br>
And dances upon the artist’s soul,<br>
With a cloven foot and a callused palm<br>
And a will to make the meaning whole.<br>
<p>
Life’s creations reveal sensations<br>
And notions of what beauty should be,<br>
And what it is now and has always been<br>
And helps unveil the mystery.<br>
<p>
The artist creates, his passion pulsates,<br>
And the world is awed by his intent --unclear,<br>
While their thoughts try to hide from their mind’s eyes,<br>
What they want to see, they try to fear.<br>
<p>
For all that is true, and all that is new<br>
Is never enough to convince those who Know,<br>
And the truth is forbidden --merely locked inside,<br>
And the process of art is painful and slow.<br>
<p>
But the artist persists and his spirit resists<br>
The ties to all judgment and extrapolation,<br>
He ignores all the bounds and demands on his work<br>
And devotes himself wholly to his creation.<br>
<p>
