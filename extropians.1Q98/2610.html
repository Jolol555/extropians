&lt;D. What remains<br>
<p>
There is an open area concerning the 'fact' that higher intelligence is<br>
itself limited and supposes a higher order still. In this, we might also<br>
consider that our very idea of 'higher' might be called into question.<br>
Some evolutionary biologists say that we cannot even call human<br>
intelligence 'higher' than that of any other species. <br>

Well, certainly some evolutionary biologists do not possess higher
intelligence than that of any other species if this is their hypothesis.
<p>
"The fact that higher intelligence is itself limited and supposes a higher
order still" is contained in the thought of Anselm from the eleventh
century, and is subsumed within his ontological proof for the existence of
God.  A good reference work on the subtleties of the argument and on
previous attempts to refute it can be found in Charles Hartshorne's
"Anselm's Discovery" (1965).
