Irrelevant?  If a society with slavery was more stable and more<br>
productive than a free society, the latter would shortly pass out of<br>
existence.  This is not the case now, but it may well have been the case<br>
for every agricultural society above the subsistence level.<br>

It is easy for me to believe that we have greater scientific truth than<br>
ever before, because I can see where it is coming from.  The claim that<br>
we are ethically superior to all previous civilizations is harder to<br>
swallow, especially as I still lack any idea of where 'right' and 'wrong'<br>
come from.<br>
<p>
Science cannot answer questions of right and wrong, but it can answer<br>
questions of how society should be arranged to reach a certain goal.  I<br>
suspect that in the long run that is all which really matters.  I will<br>
be convinced that a gov't-less society is possible, let alone optimal,<br>
when I see one exist and succeed.<br>

Fair enough, but what does that mean?  Is the failing a moral failing,<br>
or a lack of low enough information and transaction costs, and a stable<br>
enough starting position, for market-like mechanisms to do all the work<br>
of maintaining growth _and_ stability?<br>
