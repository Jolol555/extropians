Wei Dai, &lt;weidai@eskimo.com&gt;, writes:<br>
<i>&gt; Here is my tentative philosophy of personal identity: anyone who remembers</i><br>
<i>&gt; being me is me. By "remebers being me" I mean he/she/it has a memory of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; current thoughts and perceptions from my current perspective.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Some examples: I am the person typing at this keyboard a second ago, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; he is not me. If I become unconscious and wake up with total amnesia, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; person who wakes up is not me. If he recovers his (my) memory, then he is</i><br>
<i>&gt; me again. A copy of me is me, an upload of me is me, even a simulacrum of</i><br>
<i>&gt; me made from scratch by a Power is me, as long as it has sufficiently</i><br>
<i>&gt; authentic memories of being me. </i><br>
<p>
I see a couple of problems.  The first is a trivial matter of language.<br>
It is very confusing to write that A is B but B is not A.  Normally we<br>
use the term "is" in a symmetrical way.  It's not even clear which<br>
way to interpret a question like "are you the same person you were a<br>
second ago?".  So you might want to use a different phrasing.<br>
<p>
The larger problem is that this seems to over-emphasize the importance of<br>
memory.  Our memories are important, but it seems to me that identity<br>
requires more than just remembering.  If my mind were invaded tomorrow and<br>
rearranged so that my motivations, beliefs, and desires were completely<br>
different, then I would view the result as a different person even if it<br>
kept all my memories.<br>
<p>
I also wonder about the gray areas.  I don't remember most days of my<br>
life, so probably on most days I can expect that in the future I won't<br>
remember those days.  This would seem to imply that after a few years<br>
I will no longer exist.  Supposing I am offered the opportunity for an<br>
immortal lifespan, should I refuse it since I won't remember the present<br>
day after some years?  That doesn't seem right.<br>
<p>
Maybe you should extend it so that you write A &lt; B to indicate that B<br>
"is" A (e.g. remembers being A), and add as an axiom that A &lt; B and B &lt; C<br>
implies A &lt; C.  This way I stay alive as long as each day I remember the<br>
day before, even if after a while I have completely forgotten today.<br>
