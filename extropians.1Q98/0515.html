<i>&gt; Face it, since the God meme is as flexible as it is,</i><br>

<p>
I think there is a more important memetic niche to be filled: personal<br>
comfort. Here in Sweden most people do not believe in the Christian<br>
God - but they believe in what they usually call "something". This<br>
"something" seems to have the role of personal comfort, giving life a<br>
meaning, somebody to pray to and hope will provide some kind of<br>
afterlife. Most people (unfortunately IMHO) do not care about the<br>
indescribable absolute underlying all reality (IAUAL) - it is so remote and<br>
transcendent, and they want something to comfort them when life turns<br>
rotten.<br>
<p>
Personally I prefer the IAUAL, even if I doubt the 'I' part. But I<br>
doubt it would be an intelligent being, consciousness or even some<br>
platonic abstraction like Truth - it is likely something utterly<br>
non-comforting, like a Hilbert space.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why then do some people still react</i><br>
<i>&gt; so emotionally when the mere subject comes up? </i><br>
<p>
Good question. I have noted it myself that I get a bit irritated by<br>
religion, and I don't like to have reactions I cannot trace (I want a<br>
source-level debugger for my mind! :-). I think it is because it deals<br>
with the major questions, those questions which every human *has to*<br>
face (even if to hide from them) like what to consider the meaning of<br>
life, how to deal with the world, how to find meaning. They provide<br>
the motivational core of one's worldview, and questioning them sends<br>
distress signals directly to the autonomous levels. Most of us have<br>
not yet learned to become sufficiently relaxed and self-efficaous to<br>
be able to disconnect this defense system and deal with it on a<br>
rational level (it is hard, and has to be done with every core<br>
belief. How many of us can really react rationally to critics?).<br>
<p>
Note that this doesn't mean there is anything inherently wrong about<br>
getting revved up about attacks on your belief system - sometimes that<br>
anger is a great asset in defending it (I often notice I have a far<br>
too rational and relaxed attitude in many questions where I ought to<br>
get passionate instead in order to bring about the changes I<br>
seek). The problem is that if we just have knee-jerk reactions, we<br>
will never get anywhere. We need to refine our emotions and bring our<br>
belief systems under control.<br>
