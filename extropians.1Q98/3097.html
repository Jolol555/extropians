<i>&gt; &gt;Hey, I happen to like neuter (not neutering!), so I'm feeling a little</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;germanly repressed myself!  Give me a break, you could equally argue</i><br>
that<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;girls are neuter because they transcend the distinction between male and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;female.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Today, this would be appreciatable. At the time the German word for</i><br>
"girl"<br>
<i>&gt; became neuter, the idea of transcension was probably, if at all,</i><br>
interpreted<br>
<i>&gt; as a state of elevation to a place where angels and gods play nifty</i><br>
music.<br>
<p>
;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The denial of female sexuality has long traces in human history. It can</i><br>
be<br>
<i>&gt; found in the Bible as well (along with lots of other bullshit).</i><br>
<p>
If you are referring to nit-picky things like the gender of "girl", then<br>
this may be a problem of translation from Hebrew.  If you are referring to<br>
the global statements the Bible makes about the role of women, etc.., then<br>
it's hard to disagree with you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even today,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are religous groups which claim that women cannot experience</i><br>
orgasm.<br>
<p>
Maybe a religious justification for a personal inadequacy? ;-)<br>
<p>
"If God meant you to have an orgasm you would."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Therefore, the explanation that the neuter form of "girl" was a</i><br>
repression<br>
<i>&gt; of female sexuality seems much more likely than that it was originated to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the meme that women will "transcend" first.</i><br>
<p>
Who cares about why it was created?(even asking this question implies some<br>
sort of creator, which seems unlikely to me, unles you think your language<br>
was engineered)  What is important is how it is used.  Do people really<br>
consider girls genderless simply because their noun is neuter?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I don't think a language represses certain groups, it just lowers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the efficiency of communication.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If Hitler had forbidden the word Jew and proclaimed that all Jews have to</i><br>
be<br>
<i>&gt; called "swindlers", wouldn't you say this would be a repression of Jews</i><br>
<i>&gt; through language?</i><br>
<p>
No.  Does calling a homosexual "gay" make you think all homosexuals are<br>
happy?  Hitler has simply changed the word for Jewish, the only repression<br>
he has done affects everybody: no one can say "Jewish."    A similar<br>
situation has happened with native indians:<br>
Indian-&gt;native-&gt;aboriginal-&gt;First Nations.  None of these name changes<br>
repression in the slightest.  Did you feel differently towards natives when<br>
the politically correct(which has a similar sway to Hitler) word changed<br>
from aboriginal to First Nations?  I should hope not, the only thing I<br>
thought was how ridiculous people are for thinking replacing one word with<br>
another will change it's meaning.  I should also hope that changing the<br>
name for Jewish to "swindler" will not turn non-racist into a racist. Maybe<br>
you think that's a bad assumption, but if you do, give me a<br>
counter-example.<br>
