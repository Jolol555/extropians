<i>&gt; but just how this would be an advance for extropianism as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; movement is unclear to me, unless we regard every scientific and</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological development, as well as every cultural and political</i><br>
<i>&gt; development in the direction of greater freedom and diversity, as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; advance for extropianism as a movement.  Does extropianism just mean</i><br>
<i>&gt; civilization, then?  </i><br>
<p>
If it didn't, we'd have to correct it, wouldn't we?  After all, it<br>
is not so much the details of the principles themselves but the<br>
underlying theme of civilized achievement that lead to them which<br>
is our goal.  Max's primary contribution was not so much defining<br>
new goals, but in recognizing all the necessary conditions of the<br>
goal of civilization, and disabusing us of popular ideas that turn<br>
out to be contrary to that goal.<br>
