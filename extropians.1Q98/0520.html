<i>&gt;    Because until the concept of "God" is eradicated from this planet</i><br>
<i>&gt; entropy will continue to be a problem. To make it simple: belief in</i><br>
<i>&gt; "God"=pain,suffering, and death. That's why *I* get emotional about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the subject.</i><br>
<p>
	YES!<br>
<p>
	They all claim it's "God's plan of salvation" but it's not<br>
salvation at all!  It's damnation.  Let's stop justifying and<br>
accepting "pain,suffering, and death" and starting hopping, and<br>
striving as if, it can all be completely overcome.<br>
<p>
David A Musick &lt;davidmusick@juno.com&gt;  continued:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't understand why "God" equals pain, suffering and death.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Please explain.</i><br>
<p>
	Because, to me, if there was really a good God, he should help<br>
us in our effort to irradicate "pain, suffering, and death".  Since<br>
there is apparently no being doing much about this, to me, God must<br>
then equal pain,suffering, death..."  If you believe in God, then you<br>
are forced to theodicize and justify such evil.  It is much more<br>
moral, to me, to try to overcome than to try to justify.<br>
<p>
Rick Rossi &lt;RickR@net-effect.com&gt; commented:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On this subject one cannot say much either way, other than no one</i><br>
<i>&gt; really knows.  Atheists make the same mistake the religious do; no</i><br>
<i>&gt; data.</i><br>
<p>
	I, an atheist, admit that I don't know for sure.  It is only a<br>
hypothesis that there is no God.  But, I do have a hope that there is<br>
no God.  Many theists also think that they merely have a hope that<br>
there is a God and similarly admit that they don't know for sure.  The<br>
mistake is in the fact that God=pain, suffering, death..., therefore<br>
it cannot, by definition, be a hope that there is a God, but can only<br>
be giving up in despair that the more damnable hypothesis is the one<br>
that is really true.<br>
<p>
Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@together.net&gt; continued:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The concept of God a) in the christian meme primarily represents</i><br>
<i>&gt; eternal, unconditional love, except in those sub-sects that focus on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fire and brimstone, which just shows that they don't get it</i><br>
<p>
	To me this is a lie, since we experience pain, suffering,<br>
death...  Unless you try do something like theodicize by defining<br>
"unconditional love" to be when someone causes or allows "pain,<br>
suffering, death..." to those they unconditionally love.  To me the<br>
fruits are obvious since I know of no real christian sect that<br>
preaches of any kind of "unconditional love".  I prefer to hope that<br>
"unconditional love" is something much better than this.<br>
