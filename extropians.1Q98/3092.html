<i>&gt;Hey, I happen to like neuter (not neutering!), so I'm feeling a little</i><br>
<i>&gt;germanly repressed myself!  Give me a break, you could equally argue that</i><br>
<i>&gt;girls are neuter because they transcend the distinction between male and</i><br>
<i>&gt;female.</i><br>
<p>
Today, this would be appreciatable. At the time the German word for "girl"<br>
became neuter, the idea of transcension was probably, if at all, interpreted<br>
as a state of elevation to a place where angels and gods play nifty music.<br>
<p>
The denial of female sexuality has long traces in human history. It can be<br>
found in the Bible as well (along with lots of other bullshit). Even today,<br>
there are religous groups which claim that women cannot experience orgasm.<br>
Therefore, the explanation that the neuter form of "girl" was a repression<br>
of female sexuality seems much more likely than that it was originated to<br>
the meme that women will "transcend" first.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't think a language represses certain groups, it just lowers</i><br>
<i>&gt;the efficiency of communication.</i><br>
<p>
If Hitler had forbidden the word Jew and proclaimed that all Jews have to be<br>
called "swindlers", wouldn't you say this would be a repression of Jews<br>
through language?<br>
