Well, that is one possibility. The scientific process does not say<br>
anything special about how you come up with your hypothesises, you<br>
could make them up using Tarot or automatic writing if you want, since<br>
the important part is checking them with reality. I think Project Mind<br>
advocates the use of kabbalah and meditation to get scientific<br>
insights to be checked, for example. Different ways of inventing ideas<br>
are most likely differently good at coming up with something useful<br>
(you will have to spend a very long time permuting scrabble letters<br>
before you end up with something interesting), so they can be compared<br>
objectively.<br>
<p>
But what I was after was something deeper. The various mental systems<br>
aim for more things than knowledge. Some seek control over the mind or<br>
body. Some seek improvements in our behavior. Many (most?) are<br>
directed towards creating a feeling of meaningfulness and<br>
connectedness with society/the universe/other good things. These are<br>
obviously desirable goals, and I think they are well worth integrating<br>
minus the junk into a transhuman lifestyle.<br>
