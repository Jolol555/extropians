Sure, but we should also not cut people out because they don't have as |&lt;00|_ a<br>
computer as you, dude. The simple fact of the matter is that *everyone with a<br>
computer* can read text.  Not everyone can read HTML, as has been pointed out.<br>
The whole point of standards is to make sure that everyone can see/use/whatever<br>
the same data. The whole point of mailing lists is to communicate. If some people<br>
can't read HTML mail, why should you punish them because they are not up to your<br>
"standard" of techno-widgetry?<br>
<p>
I could then go on about text-mode versus GUIs but that's been done to death...<br>
