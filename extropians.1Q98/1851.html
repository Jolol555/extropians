The only one grasping at straws here is you.  I have not once said in <br>
the affirmative that biodiversity is necessary.  Only that our knowledge <br>
of its relation to us is still too incomplete to come to any firm <br>
conclusions.  You on the other hand, have made several conclusions <br>
without much evidence to back it up.  To wit:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Several areas on </i><br>
<i>&gt;earth (old world civilized floodplains) have had their natural </i><br>
<i>&gt;ecosystems obliterated millenia ago, and apart from salinization</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the Tigris-euphrates system, they all work fine.</i><br>
<p>
Thats because of biodiversity!  The more biodiversity, the more vectors <br>
life has to fill available niches from any said catastrophe.  If it <br>
wasn't for the rich biodiversity that existed 65 million years ago, we <br>
wouldn't even be having this discussion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Regardless</i><br>
<i>&gt;of such hypotheticals, we must act on the knowledge we have, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and that indicates that biodiversity is neither essential</i><br>
<i>&gt;nor particularly hazardous to our continued well-being.</i><br>
<p>
The biosphere is the most complex system known, so I ask you again sir - <br>
how can you claim that this complex web of life is in large part <br>
unnecessary to our survival?  What evidence do you have?  Because until <br>
you examine every lifeform - including the thousands of species of <br>
bacteria and micro-organisms that are a part of our environment and the <br>
role they play  within and without our our body, you cannot claim much <br>
of anything.  It could turn upon further investiagtion, that our current <br>
ecosystem of which we are a part, might be so fragile that the <br>
elimination of one species would unravel enough to take us out with it.  <br>
The bottom line is - I don't know.  So how can you? <br>
<p>
What I am asking for you to do, is to suspend judgement on that which <br>
you are ignorant.  Or are you profesising that you do have complete <br>
knowledge of the entire biosphere down to its most minute processes?<br>
