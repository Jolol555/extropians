It seems that like a lot of scientists, there is one variable which may<br>
escape you. Experience. What experience do you have using this drug? You<br>
can speculate about its possible effects on the brain, but it seems that<br>
when you guess at something like this and remove personal experience from<br>
the mix, there's little substance left.<br>
<p>
I'm a long time smoker of hemp and find its effects very productive and<br>
useful. I use it as a catalyst to encourage the sort of "flow" and<br>
intuition that is at the root of my very best artwork. In fact, I can<br>
speak for a large portion of the fine arts community and certainly an even<br>
bigger segment of the music community that hemp is a powerful creative<br>
catalyst.<br>
<p>
How does that fit into your estimation of its function on the brain??<br>
<p>
I'll tell you why I'd like to think of hemp as a (pardon the cliché)<br>
transhuman tool because at the root of my personal transition are the<br>
creative ideas which forge and inspire my visions of a future culture. As<br>
a technology artist, the cultural and technological speculation I make<br>
about our world could eventually inspire its evolutionary direction. (not<br>
that my ideas are changing the world, but look at philip k dick or other<br>
visionary futurists) I'm not saying their process or mine depends on hemp,<br>
but I'm sure that if you were to investigate why artists use hemp, they'd<br>
have a similar opinion.<br>
<p>
I think on another level, its true that a drug like hemp, can create a<br>
powerful apathetic response in some people.  But to generalize is always<br>
dangerous. I'm a very driven person and I don't let 'drugs' derail success<br>
by tampering with my drive..  I'm managing to fill my world with<br>
technology, remain self employed and live in one of the most expensive<br>
cities in the U.S.<br>
<p>
Ok.. my ranting ends..<br>
