Julian Simon died this past Sunday at the age of 65.<br>
<p>
There is an excellent tribute to Mr.Simon by Ben Wattenberg in today's <br>
Wall Street Journal.<br>
<p>
Mr. Simon's contributions to the extropian movement are tremendous. He <br>
believed in reason and optimism and continually argued against the gloom <br>
and doom environmentalists, always backing up his arguments with facts. <br>
The key insight in all of his work is that humans are the "ultimate <br>
resource."<br>
<p>
I never knew Mr. Simon personally, although I did exchange a couple of <br>
email messages with him last year. However, I feel as if I've lost <br>
someone from my own family. Actually, his death is a loss for the human <br>
"family." <br>
