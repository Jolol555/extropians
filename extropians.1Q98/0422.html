There is a  difference. If I say "Fido is a dog" that is a  of the <br>
logical form Dog (Fido). The "is a" is a way to indicate predicate <br>
instantiation and is really superfluous. That is very different from <br>
"3+2=5" or "The morning star is the evening star." which are of the <br>
form a=b, or equivalently, Identity(a,b); here the "is" is a <br>
predicate itself. Here we are using the identity predicate <br>
which is per definition symmetric. And that is presumably what Hal <br>
thinks it looks as if you are doing when you say about two <br>
person-segments that they are the same person, that the person <br>
to which the former person-segment belongs is the same person as <br>
that to which the latter person-segment belongs. This looks like a=b. <br>
<p>
Not that we might not need a new grammar for personal identity. Our <br>
present notion seems to be hopelessly vague and confused. But it <br>
might be best to use new terms to signify the new usage you propose. <br>
Stop talking about personal identity and start talking about personal <br>
containment, for example?<br>
