I had a very telling and frustrating experience with the<br>
Soviet "mini-singularity".  There were lots of people<br>
who were putting tremendous effort and lost more than<br>
can be rewarded, to bring the system to the breaking point<br>
- only to see all the opportunities seized by existing<br>
power structures, both official and shadow, that in the<br>
turmoil removed the ties of the previous laws, turned<br>
the control they had into more explicit form, wiped<br>
out the populations' savings and even the small social<br>
guarantees they worked so hard to earn from the<br>
previous regime, and legally acquired enormous wealth<br>
and the right to use it.  The power guys, from party<br>
officials to the military, industry, and mafia, were<br>
much better positioned to take advantage of the change<br>
that the kamikaze dissidents worked so hard to bring.<br>
<p>
The next echelon of beneficiaries were smaller scale<br>
folk that used to be the backbone of the communist<br>
regime - smaller officials, grocery store managers,<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
The people who actually brought all this change,<br>
were not rewarded in any way, or even thanked.<br>
Most of them are busy trying to earn some salary<br>
from serving the new elite.  Some escaped to lead<br>
more protected, but usually very mundane lives<br>
in the West.<br>
<p>
I managed to engineer a little personal singularity<br>
by using the events to escape to the _frontier_ of<br>
the opened world.  I wouldn't swap my position with<br>
that of any of my former peers, but the transition<br>
was extremely costly, lonely, and uncertain.<br>
<p>
Now I have less motivation to expend my effort for<br>
common Singularity.<br>
