I don't know yet when the film will be screened in Europe - I'm going to<br>
the US this week and if I get any information on dates of European<br>
screenings, I will let you know.<br>
<p>
In answer to your query of why the title VIRTUAL OBSESSION, I have to put<br>
my hands in the air and say "not guilty!"  The choice of title for Mick<br>
Garris who directed has always been HOST, but ABC in their infinite wisdom<br>
decide this was stronger.  They could be right, who knows?<br>
<p>
You ask if this title implies that the search for immortality is an<br>
obsession in the story, and yes, it is, but almost every scientific<br>
breakthrough in the history of man has been the result of an obsession,<br>
frequently in the face of heavy criticism.  The bigger the breakthrough,<br>
the heavier the criticism - look at Gallileo and Darwin as two examples.  I<br>
think it is right that there should be criticism over man's search for<br>
immortality.  I wholly believe that we are right to challenge the dominance<br>
of Mother Nature and to take control of our world and our destinies, but<br>
there are all kinds of issues that need to to be addressed, and which will<br>
be addressed for sure over the coming decades as we move closer and closer<br>
towards it.  But it is also a hugely exciting issue.  We are at a giant<br>
frontier - but who knows - in a few decades time we could be at yet another<br>
frontier, when we discover totally new dimensions, that may make our search<br>
for immortality puny by comparison....<br>
