FOrrest Bishop,<br>
<p>
I just read your paper on open Air Habitats, in which you cited my posts<br>
to this list in 97 in the following paragraph:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A magnetic field can be added to this world without much further effort by</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrapping superconducting wire or film around the circumference to form a</i><br>
<i>&gt; current loop [10, Lorrey, M., (1997), transhuman/extropian mailing lists (March)]. &gt; The resulting magnetic dipole field would deflect the solar</i><br>
<i>&gt; wind much like Earth’s magnetic field protects us from these charged</i><br>
<i>&gt; particles. On Earth, some of these particles are entrained in the magnetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; field, bouncing back and forth between the North and South Poles, creating the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Auroral Lights. The cylinder has no atmosphere at its "poles", so the</i><br>
<i>&gt; particles can either be allowed to circulate through the center of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cylinder (forming a sort of ionosphere), or collected and stopped by charged</i><br>
<i>&gt; plates at either end of the spin axis.</i><br>
<p>
Another effect of this ion flow will be that since each pole will<br>
attract oppositely charged particles, in the center where the flows<br>
interact, you will get a large amount of dischaging which could<br>
interfere with communications across the hub. I'd suggest the addition<br>
of a membrane or grid of some sort that would generate power from this<br>
potential difference. Having two grids, one across the north edge of the<br>
hoop, and another across the south edge of the hoop, with a circuit in<br>
between would pull a large amount of energy from the solar ion stream,<br>
and sheild communications within the hub from interference.<br>
<p>
