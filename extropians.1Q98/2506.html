<p>
  IAN: Why should we think that boundaries are more<br>
  real than holism?  What I'm getting at is maybe<br>
  because holism is winning the truth test, one<br>
  suddenly thinks "Ah, who needs truth anyway?<br>
  'The truth' is a religious concept." Which<br>
  constructs a scenario in which a holistic<br>
  paradigm cannot be allowed to prevail.<br>
<p>
  That may not be your intention at all,<br>
  but in the set of all counters, it <br>
  tends to fit that interpretation.<br>
<p>
  If atomism seems to win the truth test,<br>
  then religious holist says, "Ah, truth <br>
  is logical, who needs it?"  Inversely,<br>
  if holism seems to be winning the truth <br>
  test, atomists will say, "Ah, truth is <br>
  religious, who needs it?" In short, each <br>
  attempts to prevent the opposing view from<br>
  prevailing by redefining the standards upon<br>
  which "the correct" philosophy is measured.<br>
<p>
  I'm probably unfairly lumping you into the <br>
  category of "die-hard atomist defenders,"<br>
  which is such relative to other categories.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Maybe holism is an artificial construct of the mind. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: The universe is one whole entity with a<br>
  myriad interconnected entities. In short, the<br>
  universe -- the sum of reality -- is invariably<br>
  holistic by its nature,  with or without our <br>
  ideological constructions.  Our constructs <br>
  may be more or less like what the physical<br>
  universe is like. I want it to be moe like<br>
  what reality is, and it is like holistic.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;It may, in fact, be </i><br>
<i>&gt;impossible to think of anything at all without thinking of at least</i><br>
<i>&gt;two things that are some somehow related and interacting. Try, I </i><br>
<i>&gt;mean, really try, to think of just one thing without it being related </i><br>
<i>&gt;to anything else at all. What could you possibly be thinking of?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: The structure of thoughts can act as a <br>
  model of the universe. Just as we cannot think<br>
  of A free from relation to ~A, a universe that<br>
  is all composed of 100% of  one feature, devoid<br>
  of any complementary features, is a nonuniverse,<br>
  it cannot even have a single atom, since the <br>
  identity structure of an atom requires that <br>
  there be an area that is particle/wave (A) <br>
  and an area that is not particle/wave (~A)<br>
  in which the particle/wave exists as it is.<br>
<p>
  The concept, "100% of one feature" is an absurdity,<br>
  since "one feature" requires a complementary feature,<br>
  thus one feature implies and requires two features,<br>
  and that is holism. I posit that logic maps truth.<br>
