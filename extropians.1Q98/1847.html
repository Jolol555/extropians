You're really grasping at straws at this point.  Several areas on <br>
earth (old world civilized floodplains) have had their natural <br>
ecosystems obliterated millenia ago, and apart from salinization<br>
in the Tigris-euphrates system, they all work fine.  You also<br>
omitted my point that our current crops have been well demonstrated<br>
to have no need at all for biodiversity.<br>
<p>
If you're going to try for wild hypotheticals, I would point out <br>
that it's easy to imagine hypotheticals in which biodiversity <br>
brings the end of our civilization.  AIDS come over from chimps<br>
only about 50 years ago; if there had been no wild chimps at<br>
the time we almost certainly would have had no AIDS epidemic.<br>
Every time a wild monkey comes down with Ebola there's a finite<br>
chance that it will mutate to a form that readily infects humans<br>
and that really could mean sayonara to human civilization.  No<br>
wild monkeys; no Ebola; no risk; but it's silly to make major<br>
decisions on wild hypotheticals, so they stay.<br>
<p>
The host-switch disease problem is not entirely hypothetical;<br>
unlike the hypothesized need for biodiversity it really has<br>
happened numerous times in the past, although never yet in<br>
a form that would truly threaten modern civilization.  Regardless<br>
of such hypotheticals, we must act on the knowledge we have, <br>
and that indicates that biodiversity is neither essential<br>
nor particularly hazardous to our continued well-being.<br>
In terms of changing our existance in a incremental fashion<br>
biodiversity is probably good; but in terms of major catastrophic<br>
changes it's probably bad.<br>
