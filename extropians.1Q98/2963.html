Is "Society" a deep peme?<br>
-------------------------<br>
<p>
In writing my previous peme post, I vacillated between<br>
calling "society" a near-surface peme and calling it a<br>
moderately deep peme.<br>
<p>
My experience is that most libertarians relatively easily<br>
see the fraudulent ways in which "society" is used by<br>
political "masters" against their "subjects."  For this<br>
reason I should call it a near-surface peme.<br>
<p>
However, I thought a few people might not see it so<br>
easily, so I decided on "moderately deep peme."<br>
<p>
It now seems that for some people it's a surface peme;<br>
for some, near-surface; for some, moderately deep; for<br>
some, deep; and maybe for a few, extremely deep.<br>
<p>
A thought process that will help some to recognize and<br>
clear pemes from their minds is to make a distinction<br>
between the *word* and the *reality* (or non-reality)<br>
the word is usually used to represent.  Next focus<br>
on the word and all the ways it's habitually used<br>
by political "masters."  Then consider the likely<br>
consequences typically produced in the minds of most<br>
"subjects" by such use of the word.<br>
<p>
"When *I* use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone,<br>
"it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less."<br>
<p>
"The question is," said Alice, "whether you *can* make words mean so<br>
many different things."<br>
<p>
"The question is," said Humpty Dumpty, "***which is to be master --<br>
that's all***."  [***emphasis added]<br>
<p>
-- Lewis Carroll, 'Through the Looking-Glass'<br>
<p>
If the word in question does indeed represent some reality,<br>
then it might be better to use some other word.  For example,<br>
you could use "terrocrat" instead of "government official."<br>
(Terrocrat = terrorist bureaucrat or coercive political agent.)<br>
"The question is, which is to be master -- that's all."<br>
<p>
A correspondent privately wrote to me that for certain<br>
purposes it's necessary to look at a higher level than<br>
that of individual.  For example, we can predict fairly<br>
accurately that out of a million people x% will die from<br>
cancer; whereas we can't predict with much accuracy how<br>
a specific individual will die.<br>
<p>
In clearing the "society" peme from your mind, nothing<br>
prevents -- nor is there any suggestion stopping --<br>
you from considering higher levels, such as "people<br>
in general..."<br>

<i>&gt;There is much in the ... [peme material] that is useful</i><br>

<i>&gt;implication other sub-collectives do not exist is clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt;in error.  Pemes (political memes) are to "power collectives",</i><br>
<i>&gt;"political systems", or "social organisms" as genes are</i><br>
<i>&gt;to biological organisms.  One could just as well say that</i><br>
<i>&gt;biological organisms don't exist [actually some extreme</i><br>
<i>&gt;materialist reductionists actually say this!].</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In generating propaganda favoring the individualism that</i><br>
<i>&gt;is trying to be promoted ... [in the peme material], I</i><br>
<i>&gt;would not attempt to deny reality, but warn what little</i><br>
<i>&gt;is left of "individuals" infected by pemes that they</i><br>
<i>&gt;are being subsumed by a collective or power organism....</i><br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't they rather be an individual?  As pemes operate</i><br>
<i>&gt;below the level of rational analysis in most individuals</i><br>
<i>&gt;such individuals still attempt to view themselves as</i><br>
<i>&gt;individuals...so there is something to work with there.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Denial doesn't work.  One of Ron Hubbard's valid</i><br>
<i>&gt;contributions was:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;            Not Is  -&gt;&gt;   Maintains a "reality"</i><br>
<i>&gt;            Alter is -&gt;&gt;  Changes a "reality"</i><br>
<i>&gt;            As is    -&gt;&gt;  Obliterates a "reality"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
It will help to make a distinction between the peme as a<br>
*word* as separate from any *reality* (or non-reality) the<br>
word is supposed to represent.<br>
<p>
In a sense, when the *word* is viewed "as is" ("as it is"),<br>
together with all the ways in which it is habitually used,<br>
as well as the consequences produced by such use, then the<br>
validity of the word is obliterated -- leaving the *reality*<br>
(or non-reality), the word is supposed to represent, unchanged.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I do not agree with Brother Rothbard.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"...[O]ne of the prime errors in social theory is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;treat "society" as if it were an actually existing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;entity.  "Society" is sometimes treated as a superior</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;holds that only individuals exist, think, feel, choose,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and act..."  ('For a New Liberty')</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To view society as an encompassing entity serves many</i><br>
<i>&gt;purposes. One explicit purpose is, I can berate, chastise,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and even withstand society, without necessarily doing so</i><br>
<i>&gt;with one individual in the process.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Harry Browne:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"The gigantic myth called "society" that rules so many</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;lives doesn't even exist."  ('How I Found Freedom...')</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The fact is, society shall continue to exist. The degree</i><br>
<i>&gt;to which we individually allow it to rule us is a personal</i><br>
decision. Society is not a myth.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;When I spent a year in Korea, I went to Seoul a few times.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Upon looking down a street, what did I see but thousands</i><br>
<i>&gt;of black heads. Koreans have black hair. Did I see a sea</i><br>
<i>&gt;of individuals, whereby I could intimately respect each</i><br>
<i>&gt;of their personalities? No, I saw a see of black heads.</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's all I saw. That was society. When I go to the fair</i><br>
<i>&gt;or a football game, I see the same thing. Please, explain</i><br>
<i>&gt;to me in straightforward terms, how am I supposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;relate to all those people individually?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Was the "society" peme planted in your brain?  Did</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you buy it?  Have you been helping to perpetuate</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and spread it in accordance with peme rule 19:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;peme purveyors) communicate -- although</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;they may question, attack, and expose a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;few surface pemes -- they shall make a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;special effort to use deep pemes in their</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;language -- in order to maximize peme</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;survival and propagation?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm sorry, but you have failed to make me feel insecure</i><br>
<i>&gt;about who I am.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
This isn't personal.  I can't make you feel.  You are<br>
in control of your feelings; they're your responsibility.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Tyrants use the "society" peme in various ways: "It's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;in the best interest of society"; "It's a crime against</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;society"; "The will of society"; "Society is the cause</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of his criminality"; "Society has a right to define what</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;marriage is and what it is not"; etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;By perpetuating and spreading the "society" peme, does</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;your mind serve as a weapon for tyrants?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;What I'm trying to sell you on is clearing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;deep pemes from your mind, and assisting</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;others to do the same.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You sold me on the premise of pemes. I like it. It is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;good analysis tool. I will make great use of it. Thank</i><br>
<i>&gt;you very much.</i><br>
