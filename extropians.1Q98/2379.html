<i>&gt; Can you think of short scenes from movies or TV that would illustrate</i><br>

<p>
Seems like synchronicities are starting (I'm just trying to find another<br>
thinker/prover game since I can't find any quarters ;-) ):<br>
<p>
Just a few days ago I had an idea for a video-clip which would be just<br>
perfect for that purpose. Unfortunately so far it only exists in my head<br>
:-(<br>
<p>
The basic idea is simply showing a person being uploaded to a<br>
super-computer, getting some sort of brain- and body-update (turning him<br>
into a cyborg), and downloading back to the enhanced body. At the end<br>
he's at a party, having real good fun - and no one even realizes he's a<br>
complete cyborg.<br>
<p>
So far, all I have are about 2 pages of ideas and a basic "storyline"<br>
and some of the visuals in my head... through the whole thing, the<br>
positive aspects of transhumanism will be shown (no Frankenstein<br>
atmosphere).<br>
<p>
later,<br>
Holger<br>
