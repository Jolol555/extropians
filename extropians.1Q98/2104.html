<p>
Of course.  Surely, every little bit helps.  I wonder: Do you think the<br>
injunction "Respect rights" is less abstract than "Respect diversity"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I don't agree that power/knowledge-assymmetries neccesarily makes shared</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights unreliable.</i><br>
<p>
Do you agree that an historical case can be made for the claim that<br>
massive power/knowledge assymmetries often *have* permitted or even<br>
encouraged systems of rights to perform less reliably?<br>
<p>
 I think mutual respect for property rights is a kind<br>
<i>&gt; of right which, once firmly established, essentially all participants have</i><br>
<i>&gt; an incentive to defend the system, and adding mechanisms to discriminate</i><br>
<i>&gt; between entities that want to use it would detract from the system.</i><br>
<p>
Isn't the problem that what will constitute "respect for property rights"<br>
(think of state "takings" or urban squatting, etc) is always open to <br>
interpretation, and in the face of the kinds of *massive* power/knowledge<br>
assymmetries we're talking about when we're talking of Power/mehuman<br>
"relations", it's a safe bet just whose "interpretations" will stick.<br>
No, I've come to agree with you even more than before about the near<br>
uselessness of merely abstract guarantees against abuses.  It seems the<br>
thing that best buttresses security and stability is a plurality of<br>
competing Powers no one of whom can do too much damage without stepping on<br>
toes that matter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The "respect diversity" meme is one of the reasons I'm biased against</i><br>
<i>&gt; vegetarianism - I want diversity in my food.</i><br>
<p>
As do I.  Vegetarianism questions your prior assumption of the<br>
appropriateness of designating "animals" as "food" in the first place.<br>
Not to suggest that there aren't obvious differences in play here, but I<br>
scarcely imagine you feel the diversity of your diet is challenged by a<br>
refusal of cannibalism?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't see how valuing diversity implies giving plants a different </i><br>
<i>&gt; status than animals. </i><br>
<p>
Part of valuing diversity is respecting sentience and the forms it takes<br>
in the world.  That animals are sentient and plants are not is a<br>
difference in status that isn't exactly arbitrary to take note of, surely? <br>
What you go on to do after noting it is up to you.  Best, Dale<br>
