I think they're afraid of the slippery slope of identifying the sex/<br>
gender of intersexuals.  Women of the type you describe certainly<br>
are far closer to "normal" women than men; but there are lots of <br>
intersexuals who fall all over the map.  Many people in<br>
this world who were born with essentially male biology but the parts<br>
didn't come out right.  Conventional therapy for these kinds of <br>
intersexual is, to put it very crudely, lop off any genitalia that<br>
sticks out and give them estrogens, starting as soon as possible<br>
after birth.  I am *not* making this up.  Plus there are even more<br>
people in all the states between "basically male" and "basically female".<br>
<p>
The sporting authorities have a clear rule now and it would take a lot<br>
to make them change.  In addition, intersexuality is a very touchy <br>
topic and I think few want to get into it.<br>
