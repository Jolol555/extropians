<i>&gt; First of all, thanks to all those who have provided input. I especially</i><br>

<i>&gt; technology itself, such as robotics. I intend a major part of my</i><br>

<i>&gt; control (ie. governmental intervention) is unnecessary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
There is a fatal problem with this analogy. The homeostasis (i.e.,<br>
corrective feedback) of the neural system is not spontaneous, but is<br>
the result of evolution by mutation and natural selection. <br>
Robotics fails as an analogy because the design of a robot is<br>
under control, and the functions of the robot are typically adjusted<br>
during the design phase to produce a desired range of results.<br>
IMO, there is no equivalent selective force in society as a<br>
whole that will cause the techno-societal system to tend toward<br>
homeostasis. "Spontaneous order" does occur in many arbitray<br>
complex systems, but other arbitrary complex systems exhibit<br>
self-destructive behaviour. You cannot simply chant "spontaneous<br>
order" as a mantra. You must attempt to identify the corective<br>
mechanisms.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, I am looking for a technology which does not seem to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; acknowledged by government in policy (yet...) but which may provide</i><br>
<i>&gt; dilemma in the future. Would Artificial Intelligence be appropriate? As</i><br>
<i>&gt; a computer science undergrad this would be my preference, but if anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; has any better suggestions I would gratefully receive them.</i><br>

Try software design productivity improvement in general, and<br>
software tools for the development of distributed algorithms in<br>
particular. These technologies are uncontrolled, but result in<br>
supercomputing for everyman. The "great Mersienne prime search"<br>
and other recent distributed computing challenges are a crude<br>
first step. The distinguishing attribute of technology, as<br>
opposed to other human endeavors such as art sports, etc., is that<br>
technological advancement contributes strongly and measurably<br>
to further technological advance. This is almost a definition<br>
of positive feedback, which is exactly the wrong kind of feedback<br>
for a stable system.<br>
<p>
This says to me that society as we know it is doomed, but I'm<br>
optimistic that successor to our society will be an unimaginable<br>
improvement.<br>
<p>
We are building our successor, and we're almost finished.<br>
