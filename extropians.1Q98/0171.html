Sounds unlikely, but what is the evidence for your theory?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Possible, but I doubt it. We usually get enough ascorbic acid from our</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; food, and excrete the surplus in our urine, so being able to produce</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; would not be a major advantage. I seem to recall that some mammals can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; produce it, but I might be wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The ascorbic acid is just an example, the fact is that a simple</i><br>
<i>&gt;metabolic process might be the cause of aging. A metabolic process that</i><br>
<i>&gt;occurs without errors in non-aging species (for example, tiny portions</i><br>
<i>&gt;of free-radicals might be the cause of aging, minimal differences in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;concentration of ascorbic acid might cause small cellular damages that</i><br>
<i>&gt;cause aging). Of course this is very optimistical, but I am more</i><br>
<i>&gt;convinced now than I was a few months ago that a few genes might be the</i><br>
<i>&gt;cause for aging.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This errors are different than the ones I mentioned above, these are</i><br>
<i>&gt;errors in processes that can be corrected (on a optimistical base).</i><br>
<i>&gt;Other cause of genetic errors might be our more advanced functions (like</i><br>
<i>&gt;I mentioned before), this errors are surely much harder to correct (if</i><br>
<i>&gt;they exist, and I think they do weather in the form of aging, or in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;form of inevitable lethal diseases that affect the elderly --</i><br>
<i>&gt;Alzheimer's disease, mad cow disease, some types of cancer, etc).</i><br>
<p>
In "Confronting the Boundaries of Human Longevity" by S. Jay Olshansky et<br>
al. (_American Scientist_ 86(1) Jan/Feb 1998), the authors liken aging in<br>
humans to the accumulation of errors too.  They use an analogy of an Indy<br>
500 race car.  the car is designed to run continuously with minors pit stops,<br>
etc. for 500 miles.  Now imagine if the car is kept going after 500 miles.  It<br>
was not designed to fall apart 100 miles later, but things would start to<br>
happen.<br>
