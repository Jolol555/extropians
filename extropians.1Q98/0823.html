There is a problem with conspiracy theories.  On the whole, they<br>
are wrong.  Surely, people do conspire, but it is not as successful<br>
as conspiracy theorists think.<br>
<p>
Also, as for its utility, it has a way of backfiring.  Those deeply<br>
mired in conspiracy theories, from my experience, are either<br>
apathetic -- because they believe they are impotent while any<br>
group of conspirers are omnipotent -- or pro-government --<br>
because they think government as a institution is great, if<br>
it weren't for those evil conspiracies.  In other words, eliminate<br>
the conspiracies and we can have a welfare state or a total<br>
democracy that really works.  Thus, they are utopians.<br>
<p>
These are the risks you run if you spread this meme.  Another<br>
risk is that those who have no affinity for the simplistic<br>
explanations of conspiracy theorists tend to think you are a<br>
kook.  Thus, you gain influence amongst simpletons only to<br>
lose it amongst those who would be better to have as allies.<br>
<p>
I wouldn't bring this up if the average person, rightly or<br>
wrongly -- and this applies to the average smart person<br>
too -- thinks our ideas are weird or even insane.  Now,<br>
couple transhumanism/Extropianism with conspiracy<br>
theories and see if you are taken more seriously.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
