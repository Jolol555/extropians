<p>
My question is this - which individuals do not fail to be individuals?  It <br>
seems that all of us, populace and cognoscenti alike, are subject to the same <br>
set of principles that govern our attitudes, beliefs and behaviors.<br>
<p>
Whether I believe the government is telling the truth about TWA flight 800 or <br>
that it was hit by a missile, either way my beliefs have been determined by <br>
memes.  I've either been influenced by the memes of the government / media or <br>
by the alternative memes that come to me by way of Ian Goddard and others.  In <br>
either case, I have exercised no more choice in the matter than that of any <br>
borg drone.<br>
<p>
My point - we can not exercise control over which memes take to our mind.  <br>
Whichever story I wind up buying on this or any other issue will have been <br>
determined by the shape of my mind at the time I first consider it, which was <br>
determined by the last million things I heard, etc, etc. <br>
<p>
Don't believe me?  I've noticed a strong tendency for all memetically minded <br>
thinkers to keep clinging to some notion of the metaphysical "I".  How can one <br>
accept that all of our traits came to be the way that they are by the <br>
evolution of genes and memes, and yet still think that somewhere 'in there' is <br>
a "me" who is capable of exercising some control over the process?<br>
<p>
To take a famous example, Richard Dawkins argues that humans can "rebel <br>
against the tyranny of the selfish replicators."  He gives the example that <br>
every time we use contraception, we are rebelling against the tyranny of genes <br>
who want us to procreate.  But who is really rebelling in this example?  To <br>
me, this seems like an case of the meme for contraception winning a big <br>
victory in the battle for survival against certain genes.  But to hypothesize <br>
a magical "self" that lurks around in our brains, deciding which memes and <br>
which genes will exercise influence over our behaviors at which time is a joke <br>
that no reflective thinker could suffer.          <br>
 <br>
Will anyone argue differently?  <br>
<p>
<p>
