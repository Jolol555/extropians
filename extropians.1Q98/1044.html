Surely, since memetic reproduction of information exists, an ecology must<br>
also exist there.  It's a well-greased surface on which information can<br>
slide around and interact with other information, at least as compared to <br>
genetics.<br>

But what does this creature eat?  Hmmn...  It must secrete waste products, <br>
also.  I think it eats plants, since meat is grown from plants...  But it <br>
put the plants (farms) there as part of its own system.  It also eats land <br>
(mining, building, etc).  So, it runs on sunlight and eats land.<br>
<p>
It's a plant!  Plants are smarter than humans after all!<br>
<p>
I think it secretes television as a waste product.<br>
