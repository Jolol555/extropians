I will go even further.<br>
<p>
An an-aesthetic life is not worth living.<br>
<p>
Art is what distinguishes "us" from ants.<br>
<p>
Absent art, one branch of which is technology (and I'll fight that one to<br>
the _death_, I will), there is nothing worth preserving or enhancing. <br>
<p>
&lt;Another branch of aesthetics is ethics. I won't bother fighting that one,<br>
it's self-evident to anyone who's ever really examined hir life. Jumping on<br>
a hand grenade is performance art--the very very highest. (serious :))&gt;<br>
<p>
Let me repeat that: absent art, nothing is worth preserving OR enhancing.<br>
Nothing.<br>
<p>
Art is human-directed Quality. Love is high art. Building nanomachines to<br>
repair a genome is lower art. But almost everything worth doing other than<br>
survival...<br>
<p>
...is art.<br>
<p>
Get used to the idea; you might like it!<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;Extropian art?  I've just do not get it.  What is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;significance of art by people who actively strive for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;transhumanism. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Some transhumans are artists.  Their work, as professionals or as hobbyists,</i><br>
<i>&gt;is very dear to them.  Their art provides them with a venue to explore and</i><br>
<i>&gt;expose ideas -- a means to express their views of transhumanity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What is the significance of science by transhumans?  What is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;significance of developing technologies by transhumans?  What is the point</i><br>
<i>&gt;of writing transhuman science fiction, or transhuman non-fiction?  What is</i><br>
<i>&gt;the point for designing healthy foods, or working out?  What is the point of</i><br>
<i>&gt;living, for that matter?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I am not saying it has no significance.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;how significant is it in the grand scheme of things?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extraordinarily insightful -:)  What's the significance of a kiss in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;grand scheme of things?  What's the significance of an idea or a moment of</i><br>
<i>&gt;brilliance in the grand scheme of things?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Granted,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;it may have some peripheral value.  But does such a concept</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;warrant the allocation of resources it has been afforded?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The value of an idea is priceless.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I enjoyed my visit to the art site</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;but could help but wonder what other ways the time and effort</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;expended to create and maintain that site could have been more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;effectively utilized.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropic Art site is not a part of Extropy Institute. That is stated on just</i><br>
<i>&gt;about every page of the site.  Interesting that you should comment on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;cost of labor on this Web site.  Frankly, every hour working on it was worth</i><br>
<i>&gt;every dollar, especially because it came out of my pocket and has brought me</i><br>
<i>&gt;the greatest reward - a sense of accomplishment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Regarding your comments on technology and sex; uploads and bio-technological</i><br>
<i>&gt;fashion; the Singularity and creativity:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The future of sex is integral to our future. Technology and sex are</i><br>
<i>&gt;intertwined and becoming more so.  Fashion (bio-tech bodies) and technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;are intertwined and will become a major domain for engineers/artists. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By the way, the transhuman.org site is co-sponsored by FM-2030.  He is very</i><br>
<i>&gt;interested in sex and technology.  Style, and art. Also, the fashion of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Bio-technology.  He is also very interested in culture. He also loves</i><br>
<i>&gt;glamour and the idea of avatars.  He should also be credited for being the</i><br>
<i>&gt;strongest advocate of transhumanity. He did author the first book about</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumans, explicitly, which I consider to be the foremost book about</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhuman values. He is also my colleague who I respect.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(I'm not offended by your post.  Frankly, I'm a bit amused that someone</i><br>
<i>&gt;could be so inflexible about what is and isn't transhuman, that you, sir,</i><br>
<i>&gt;make me want to rally around all creative thinkers who dare to produce</i><br>
<i>&gt;creative projects that reflect transhumanity.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Art and the Singularity?  I think Vernor Vinge would strongly disagree with</i><br>
<i>&gt;your assumed notion that the Singularity is not affiliated with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;creative.  He is an artist, you know.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Oh, and by the way, Eric Drexler himself is quite stylish and frequently</i><br>
<i>&gt;displays the art of humor.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What use is humor, in the grand scheme of things?</i><br>
