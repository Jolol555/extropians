Before I get started I just want to say to Reilly that you've been calling me  <br>
a "entropic death-worshiper" for years now and it does have a certain charm <br>
in a turgid sort of way, but it's getting a little old now. You need another <br>
insult and I notice you're been trying out new material. If you want my <br>
opinion, "tyrant" and "murderer" are too mundane, "NAZI" has no class and<br>
"cannibal"  sounds a little silly, but "totalitarian fellow traveler" is just <br>
your writing style and has real possibilities, you should be able to milk it <br>
for another decade or two.<br>

<i>	&gt;Subjectivity is an unpleasant fact of nature for scientists because </i><br>

<p>
True.<br>
      <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;or theorize about it. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
False, very false. For the exact reasons you stated, nothing on Earth is as  <br>
easy as dreaming up a theory about subjectivity because there are no facts <br>
they must fit.<br>
		 <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;So all too many of them take the intellectually lazy or dippy way </i><br>
<i>	&gt;out of their conundrum by pretending it away.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's not lazy it's practical, if I can't study it then my time is better <br>
spent thinking about those things that I can fruitfully examine.<br>
		 <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Free will or volition is not an  epiphenomenon, it is real.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Free Will is one of the very few important things in life that I have a clear <br>
non circular definition of, the inability to predict what I will do next. <br>
I'm sure you don't like my definition and I'm equally sure you have nothing <br>
of your own to offer in its place. Saying that Free Will means having <br>
volition and volition means having Free Will, or that Free Will means making <br>
a choice and choice means deciding on your own Free Will does not cut it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Information does not exist in the absence of an "I", a knower who is </i><br>

<p>
<p>
Another example of a statement so bad its not even wrong. I'll tell you a good <br>
general method for finding such things. Assume the statement in question is <br>
true, then assume it's false, would the world be the slightest bit different?<br>
		 <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Perhaps some deeper reflection is in order.</i><br>
		<br>
You said it not me.<br>
		    <br>
<i>	 &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>	 &gt;&gt;What somebody does is more important than how they do it.</i><br>
	 <br>
<i>	&gt;This is a restatement of tyranny's favorite rationalization for </i><br>
<i>	&gt;dealing out mayhem and injustice.  The original is "the ends justify </i><br>
<i>	&gt;the means."  </i><br>
       <br>
<p>
Does the end sometimes justify the means? <br>
Yes. <br>
Does the end always justify the means? <br>
No. <br>
Is the idea that examining the phrase "the ends justifies the means" can lead <br>
to an important conclusion about anyone or anything completely idiotic ?<br>
Yes.       <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>	&gt;John, I have been down to your ontological basement before, to your </i><br>
<i>	&gt;bits of information as the foundation of all.  It is false.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well Reilly I'll give you this, you may not be right very often but at least  <br>
you're always certain.<br>
	       <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;our computer-besotted age, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The fact that you now equate digital technology with evil is not surprising. <br>
In the past you've told members of this list that you disapprove of Einstein's <br>
Theory of Relativity, both special and general, that Quantum Mechanics is <br>
nothing but foolishness, that Science shouldn't use statistical methods  <br>
because some philosopher who's name escapes me at the moment didn't like it,<br>
and even that Newton was a fool and Calculus is wrong because it's based on <br>
the idea of limits to the sum of an infinite number of terms. Your present <br>
phobia is entirely consistent with your past. Now if we could just get rid of <br>
those new fangeled diabolical death worshipping horseless carriages then<br>
everything would be beautiful.<br>
	 <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;I just don't see that anything purely digital can access the spatial, </i><br>
<i>	&gt;wave form of reality, the microcausal backward-in-time portion </i><br>
<i>	&gt;(transactional QM interpretation) or pilot wave (ontological QM </i><br>
<i>	&gt;interpretation) </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't know what you mean and I doubt you do either. If I'm wrong then <br>
explain it without your usual muddled hyperbolic prose and tell me how analog <br>
can do better.<br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;in the way consciousness does.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
OK Reilly, is Schrodinger's cat alive or dead before a conscious observer <br>
looks into the box?<br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Machines have no rights</i><br>
<p>
<p>
So you say, but I'll bet you dollars to donuts the machines will disagree.<br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;they do not have relations between subjective "I's" in any sense.  </i><br>
			  <br>
<p>
And just how do you know that, did the virgin Mary tell you in a vision?<br>
			  <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Your embrace of the culture of death blinds you to the fact that </i><br>
<i>	&gt;assisted suicide is licensing doctors to murder developing selves of </i><br>
<i>	&gt;a greater age than the unborn.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's their life, it's their decision, it's not your life, it's not your <br>
decision. If when or how your neighbor chooses to end his life is none of <br>
your god damned business!<br>
	 <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Individuals can die on their own, they just need to wait, no one is </i><br>
<i>	&gt;stopping them by not granting doctors a license to murder.  </i><br>
	 <br>
<p>
Cancer is painful, I've seen people who had it, good people. All terminal  <br>
cancer patients now receive pain killers even though it always hastens their <br>
death by a few hours or perhaps a few days. Should doctors who proscribe <br>
these drugs be jailed or executed? Should we just ignore them when they beg <br>
for death? Should we tie their hands so they can't get hold of anything sharp? <br>
Should we gag them so they can't get their wish by biting off their tongue <br>
and drowning in their own blood? You may think I'm exaggerating, I assure you <br>
I am not.       <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Values are absent in the worldview of scientific nihilism which </i><br>
<i>	&gt;denies the presence of purpose in the universe</i><br>
		<br>
<p>
I see, well tell me then, what is the purpose of the universe, and while  <br>
you're at it, I was always a little curious about the meaning of life too.<br>
		<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;This [commercialization] goes against the grain of the core ethics of </i><br>
<i>	&gt;Western Civilization</i><br>
     <br>
True.        <br>
     <br>
<i>	&gt;that have worked well for centuries on end</i><br>
     <br>
<p>
Ah, this must be a new meaning to the phrase "worked well" that I have been <br>
previously unaware of.<br>
<p>
     <br>
<i>	&gt;you will never counter John Clark's much more coherent case that he </i><br>
<i>	&gt;made for the commercial usage of conscious beings being positively </i><br>
<i>	&gt;good, to be sought for.  </i><br>
     <br>
<p>
I don't claim it's perfect but it is a positive good, let me give an example. <br>
It's clear that some people like serial murders are monsters, they're just <br>
too dangerous to freely walk the streets and must be dealt with somehow. <br>
I think the best idea is to send them to private, profit making prisons and <br>
give the prisoners a choice of which one they're sent to. However it seems to <br>
me that the victim should not be forced to pay for the cost of his tormentors <br>
imprisonment, the criminal should pay for it himself any way he can. <br>
Admittedly there are aspects of this idea that sound a little ugly, almost <br>
like slavery, but the only alternative is worse. If the prisoner is not to <br>
starve and is not required to pay his own way yhen that means somebody else, <br>
a non criminal, would be required to pay and become a "slave". If we must <br>
have "slaves" I prefer they be criminals. Reilly, I know you're very far from <br>
being a libertarian but most Extropians are and we feel little obligation to <br>
pay our neighbors bills, even if they're nice people in deep trouble, so we <br>
feel even less obligation to pay a murderers bills.<br>
<p>
I admit there are some problems to work out when the criminal is at either <br>
end of the economic spectrum. A very poor criminal would have to choose a low <br>
cost prison, but he might not be able to pay even that. The prison would try <br>
to make a profit by putting its occupants to work, but I'm not sure this <br>
would be successful. It's hard to be profitable if your employees are <br>
uneducated, stupid, dishonest and lazy. Unconventional sources of revenue may <br>
be needed if the crook is to pay his own way, Human experimentation.<br>
<p>
Pharmaceutical companies could hire private rating agencies to judge proposed <br>
Human experiments much as Standard and Poor rates bonds. The pain \ danger <br>
index would range from slightly uncomfortable \ probably harmless  to  <br>
agony \ probably fatal. A market would develop, open to anybody who was <br>
interested, not just prisoners. It would be in the financial interest of the<br>
drug companies to make the tests as safe and comfortable as possible. <br>
A market could also develop for organ transplants. All parties would benefit, <br>
medical research would get a huge boost and everybody would have a new way to <br>
make money if they chose to do it. Prisoners who have no money and don't want <br>
to sell a kidney or be a guinea pig would have an incentive to work hard in <br>
the more conventional prison work.<br>
<p>
Extremely rich criminals could also be a problem. Ross Perot shoots me in the <br>
head and is sentenced to 25 years in prison. He decides to go to a super <br>
luxury private jail in Tahiti with Polo Ponies, yacht racing, 4 star <br>
restaurants and full communication equipment so he can tend to his business. <br>
The prison charges $2,000,000 a year but that's pocket change for Ross. <br>
If he gets tired of this prison he can start his own elsewhere. <br>
All this doesn't sound like much of a deterrent.<br>
<p>
If the prisoners assets could only be used for bare necessities, victim  <br>
compensation and prosecution costs and if every PPA (Private Protection <br>
Agency) agrees to this then  there is no problem, everything would be nice <br>
and stable, but I think that is highly unlikely. In the real world Ross Perot <br>
or any other rich man wouldn't join a PPA that had a law like that in a<br>
million years unless there was no alternative.  Don't misunderstand me, I'm <br>
not saying this is a fatal flaw in Anarchy or any such nonsense I'm just <br>
saying it would probably create some conflict, but there is nothing new in <br>
that.  I doubt this homicidal billionaire problem is very serious and anyway,  <br>
in my PPA nobody would be imprisoned for more than 8 to 10 years. If the  <br>
crime was more serious than that they would be executed. Probably the PPA's <br>
will work out a compromise of some sort that is, like everything in the Human <br>
world, imperfect but does have the virtue of being stable in the real world <br>
full of real people. <br>
 <br>
By the way, I have no problem with capital punishment (if it is painless) but <br>
I do think it's a shame to fry perfectly good organs with electricity or <br>
poison them with cyanide. Waste not want not.<br>
