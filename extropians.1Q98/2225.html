<i>&gt; A targeted disease would only work if the attacker has your genome, so</i><br>

<p>
Of course. But this might be tricky, especially if your enemy is<br>
willing to kill off a few people similar to you. But in general,<br>
anonymity makes it easier to survive *direct* attacks, but it doesn't<br>
help against weapons of mass destruction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can imagine some nanodefenses that would be effective against</i><br>
<i>&gt; macroweapons. How about an exoskeleton made of cooperating nanomachines?</i><br>
<i>&gt; It would block attacks when possible and move you out of harm's way when</i><br>
<i>&gt; not. </i><br>
<p>
To some extent they might act as a "smart bulletproof west", but as<br>
anybody who had been shot while wearing a west knows, that is just<br>
partial protection. With nanotech one could always come up with<br>
nastier bullets and attacks the smart west doesn't expect.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Such armor can reduce the kill radius of a nuclear bomb by protecting</i><br>
<i>&gt; the occupant against thermal radiation and blast effects, and repairing</i><br>
<i>&gt; damages from ionizing radiation.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it would *reduce* it slightly, but nukes are still bad. Even if<br>
you survive the blast, you might get a building on top of you. And too<br>
close, not even nanotech is going to save you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nanotechnology can also help detect nuclear weapons by making sensors</i><br>
<i>&gt; cheaper. Eventually every city will probably have a nuclear detector on</i><br>
<i>&gt; every street corner.</i><br>
<p>
I wonder if this is feasible. If you wrap the nuke in a lot of lead,<br>
the radiation can probably be made so faint the detectors won't react<br>
to it. It is a bit like hiding the smell of plastic explosives for<br>
bomb dogs, it is very hard but doable. <br>
<p>
<p>
The best way of protecting oneself in a world where many people can<br>
unlesh destruction seems to be avoiding being there, and if you are<br>
there, you should have some form of backup or distribution.<br>
