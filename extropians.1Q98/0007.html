<i>&gt; When AI systems will be available, you will of course have the tools</i><br>

<i>&gt; but this method would violate their rights.</i><br>
<p>
Not necessarily. If you start to examine my innards without<br>
permission, it would be a violation of my rights. But I can give a<br>
doctor at least a temporary permission to examine my internal state,<br>
and that does not violate my rights. So if you were an AI who wanted to<br>
demonstrate your responsibility you could decide to temporary grant<br>
the examinator access to your mind-states.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Moreover, a responsibility test performed today would not give you any</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainty that the person would not turn bad in a year or so because of</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain influences.</i><br>
<p>
Note that we are not looking for responsibility here, but the ability<br>
to understand and desire rights, with the responsibilities they<br>
entail. There are plenty of people around who do not use their rights<br>
(like free expression) in any useful way, but most of us would say it<br>
is wrong to remove these rights unless they misuse them significantly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Finally, if such a test came into existence, who would define what</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be ethically acceptable and who would assure that the rules of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the test would be adapted according to changes in the ethical standard?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Would it even be possible for the test not to lag behind the ethical</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard?</i><br>
<p>
These are important implementation issues. I'm not sure about the best<br>
way of dealing with them, maybe a regular revision explicitely open<br>
for general critique?<br>
