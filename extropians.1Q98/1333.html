I wrote<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; Some years ago James Hogan wrote a novel which addressed this concept.  I<br>
was<br>
<i> &gt; greatly impressed by it and think it has significant bearing on a MNT</i><br>
future.<br>
<i> &gt; If memory serves it was entitle "Voyage to Tommorow" or something similar. </i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; The "currency" was respect and the commodity was creativity.  </i><br>
<p>
And your replied.<br>
 <br>
 Interesting.   Amazon doesn't list that title but they do list <br>
 "Voyage from Yesteryear".<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps that was the title...<br>
<p>
A brief synopsis (from memory)...a computerized , AI controlled, sublite<br>
starship transits to Alpha Centurai from earth....the only "life" it carries<br>
is germ plasm....prior to planet fall the "clones" are activated and raised by<br>
the computer...a society is established on the planetary surface...robot<br>
factories (robotipia?) meet every physical need...the only thing that<br>
computers and robots CANNOT supply is creativity...<br>
<p>
In that society a person innovates...or creates...and his creations can be<br>
endlessly duplicated by the robot factories..and given away for the<br>
asking....that person is "paid" ...given respect...by the "popularity" of his<br>
creations...(be it poetry,novel..,automobile,...or rocking chair)..the more<br>
who people avail themselves of it...the higher his esteem...<br>
<p>
There is of course more... a lot more...to the novel...but that's what<br>
impressed me the most...and I think it has some relevance to a MNT Future.<br>
