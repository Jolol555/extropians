Recently I've thought a great deal about the idea of a transhumanist film.<br>
Pulling it off,  however,  is a lot tougher than expected.  A few days<br>
back I sat down and starting scripting out the audio/visual content second<br>
by second - what seemed right at the time.  It took me an hour and<br>
forty-five minutes to get 4min. 22sec. of film scripted out.  <br>
<p>
Perhaps I'll put it on the net as soon as I get a half hour or so worth of<br>
material and graphics (maybe even the soundtrack).<br>
<p>
The marketing aspect was something that I'd thought about a long time ago<br>
when my aspiration was to become the CEO of a philanthropically transhuman<br>
company.  My idea was to bring transhuman art to the population in a<br>
humble manner.  Imagine magazine advertisements in Newsweek or Time - just<br>
one page with a piece of art on it,  maybe a little company logo in the<br>
lower right hand corner.  Then come the TV ads - 60 second music videos<br>
during popular television shows - to break the monotony of what television<br>
has become.  In the beginning you present this free art and free music -<br>
free culture - to the society that's forgotten what culture even MEANS<br>
anymore...<br>
<p>
...and of course,  that's when you subtley start throwing out some<br>
products.<br>
<p>
I don't know much about the logistics behind this actually working - or<br>
any concpet of the money involved,  but I still think it would be nice of<br>
someone to implement this marketing technique... just so I can see if my<br>
hunch was right.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that's the only way, and some of us are already working on it. I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; working with a group who are trying to put together a kind of anti-Roswell,</i><br>
<i>&gt; anti-X-Files comedy on a low budget (without direct parody). If it works </i><br>
<i>&gt; out then hopefully I can start making more 'serious' transhumanist movies afterwards (I have a very rough idea for a pro-SI 'propaganda' piece, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; we'd need a few million to make it properly).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;We should also ry to penetrate other markets.  The Latin American</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;TV market, from what I've heard, is the fastest growing.  Potential?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now the Hong Kong movie industry seems to be going down the tubes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Asian market might be another good idea. They certainly have</i><br>
<i>&gt; a taste for the bizarre (e.g. this morning I was watching 'Sex and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Zen', a comedy about a 16th century scholar who decides Buddhist </i><br>
<i>&gt; abstinence isn't for him and gets a transplant from a horse) and </i><br>
<i>&gt; Japanese movies often have a transhumanist bent. Of course the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Chinese takeover of Hong Kong might destroy much of the market</i><br>
<i>&gt; as well.</i><br>
