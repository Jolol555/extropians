<p>
<p>
No. Insurance was invented because of the non linear nature of disaster. <br>
Paying a $100 premium is a very minor disaster, not having $100,000 to pay <br>
for a operation that would save my life is not a thousand times greater  <br>
disaster, it is astronomically greater. Insurance companies exploit this <br>
inequality to their benefit and to mine. They expect to make a profit for <br>
their service or they wouldn't do it and I'm happy to pay the premium even if <br>
there is only one chance in 2 thousand that I'd ever need such an operation. <br>
The fact that the company has other customers than me is of interest to the <br>
insurance company but irrelevant to me.                <br>
                   <br>

<i>        &gt;Warning: I Am Not A Libertarian </i><br>
                  <br>
I guessed.                <br>

<i>        &gt;If diabetics pay less than they should then non diabetics will have         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to pay more.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;That's the 'market knows best' answer. I am not happy with it.         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Raging against that is like raging against gravity. If the pie is small then <br>
it's pointless to taking endlessly about how to divide it up because however <br>
you do it the pieces will be very small. The solution is to get a bigger pie, <br>
and no system creates more wealth than the free market.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>         &gt;it subordinates ethics to market realities. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think it subordinates ethics to logic, but even if you disagree, I still <br>
don't see the problem. If that's the way you feel then give money to <br>
diabetics to pay their bills, give as much as you want, I wouldn't dream of <br>
stopping you.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It's  [the free market] a lot better than, say, Soviet-style central         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;planning. But it's got weaknesses </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Of course it has weakness, nothing human is perfect, but it's the best thing <br>
found, and remember, perfection is the enemy of the good.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and I'm fairly certain that better resource allocation algorithms         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;exist, if only we are smart enough to identify them. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I sincerely hope you find them, if you do you'll become far richer than Bill  <br>
Gates and you'll deserve every penny because you'll have beaten the free <br>
market fair and square in, what else, the free market of ideas. Good luck.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What constitutes a better resource allocation algorithm? Any way of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;reconciling supply and demand that isn't vulnerable to the production         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and manipulation of monopolies, doesn't encourage its core functional         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;units to become Feudal dictatorships - corporation mini-states --and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;encourages cooperative, as opposed to defective, use of common        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;resources. Oh, and it also needs to encourage cooperation non      </i><br>
<i>        &gt;-coercively, not by being a free market with a coercive  regulatory         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;mechanism bolted on top of it.  (In other words: a system that        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;encourages mutually beneficial exchanges and discourages zero-sum         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;games. </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Experiment with your own money and liberty and that of those who want to <br>
follow you, but don't make me submit, I have no desire to play the lab rat.  <br>
People  are always coming up with hair brained ideas that have failed a <br>
thousand  times before and claim it will lead to heaven on Earth if only <br>
everybody does exactly what they're told. If I'm wrong and you're right then<br>
your  followers will be so rich, smart, happy, and good looking that you <br>
won't need  to use force to make me join as governments do, I'll join your <br>
community  willingly. I'm not holding my breath.<br>
<p>
Our positions are not symmetrical because I have no wish to force you to join <br>
the free market, anybody who want to be a socialist should be allowed to do <br>
so, just don't make me.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The day some libertarian thinker dreams up a non-coercive economic         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;system that is not susceptive to the tragedy of the commons is the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;day I become a libertarian.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You say that almost as if you think non libertarians have solved the problem.<br>
                              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Alternative: a political system that is not amenable to bribery,        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;nepotism, or corruption and that follows the old dictum of kings that         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"he who rules best, rules least". </i><br>
                               <br>
<p>
Any political system will work perfectly in a population of brilliant saints, <br>
the difference is that the Free Market will work, not perfectly, but pretty  <br>
damn well even with real flesh and blood human beings, probably intelligent <br>
machines too.<br>
