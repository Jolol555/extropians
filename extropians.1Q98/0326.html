OK, here's the dope:<br>
<p>
Straight seawater is too salty. Drink too much and the following things<br>
happen:<br>
<p>
Your body tries to piss more, because of the salt content--Seawater first<br>
acts as a diuretic.<br>
<p>
So you drink more, which drives your blood pressure up as your kidneys try<br>
frantically to get rid of the salt.<br>
<p>
At the same time, you are knocking off your intestinal flora. You get<br>
diarrhea==even more fluid loss.<br>
<p>
Eventually dehydration, renal-hepatic crisis and elevated BP (plus<br>
heatstroke in the tropics) drives you crazy, shortly before you die.<br>
<p>
People who run out of drinking water should have had a ROGA desalinization<br>
pump onboard. Unfortunately, the cheapest one I've found sells for $500 at<br>
West Marine, so it's not within the budget of a boat-person or refugee.<br>
