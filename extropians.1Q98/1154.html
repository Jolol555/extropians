As stated, this has the wiff of decomposing crustaceans.  If true, I<br>
think a lot of critical details on "bits of genetic material" are<br>
missing.  There's lots of different ways to combine the "bits" and<br>
different ways have different plausibilities.<br>

<i>&gt;An AP story today reported two scientists at the Charleston</i><br>
<i>&gt;Oceanographic Institute have successfully genetically engineered the</i><br>
<i>&gt;first mammal hybrid.  The Scientists, Dr. Lisa Velasquez and Dr.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Michael Poczkinsky, used bits of genetic material from both a</i><br>
<i>&gt;bottle-nosed dolphin and the egg of a walrus, fertilized in vitro, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;implanted into an adult walrus for gestation.  The healthy offspring,</i><br>
<i>&gt;termed a "Dolrus", seems healthy and is now three months old.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Phenotypically, it has the features of a somewhat larger dolphin, only</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is able to carry itself out of the water and locomote on land.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dolrus appears to have the breathing apparatus of the dolphin, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;preliminary study seems to show tusks will develop much like the</i><br>
<i>&gt;walrus.</i><br>
