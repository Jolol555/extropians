Well, gee, this leaves, um, Benin and Uzbekistan.<br>

You and I both know that the rest of the world DOES kowtow to US<br>
policies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yet it</i><br>

<p>
I have heard that an awful lot of effort is put in by the US to<br>
try to either destroy the Cuban agricultural system or to<br>
destabilise the govt.  If the US were so wonderful, why don't<br>
they trade with Cuba? Why force cuba to trade with nations far<br>
away, and to punish companies who DO trade with Cuba?<br>

????? Are you saying that this is the prime focus of cuban<br>
agriculture? Really?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; The best definition of freedom probably comes from the anarcho-socialists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Not being oppressed by power structures while, at the same time, helping to</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Evolution of what? And how? You cannot create change without force and the use</i><br>

<p>
This is bullshit.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; There are clues that the Phoenicians have reached America. The Romans</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; circumvented Africa. They built better ships, had generally higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology (besides the steam engine, electricity and their consequences,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; there's little they didn't have) , more social and economic freedom and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; much higher standard of living than the Middle (AKA Dark)  Ages could ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ROTFL to you. Having 30% of the population in slavery is NOT 'more social and</i><br>
<i>&gt; economic freedom' (although to an avowed socialist, I can see why one might</i><br>
<i>&gt; think so). The Roman ships were decidedly NOT better built than the Caravels and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Galleons of the Middle ages, or of even the Viking ships. A Roman boat was</i><br>
<i>&gt; barely able to navigate the Mediterranean, </i><br>
<p>
And yet they circumnavigated Africa.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and piracy was a scourge throughout</i><br>
<i>&gt; the empire that little was done to suppress, as pirates provided the main slave</i><br>
<i>&gt; supply.</i><br>
<p>
Well, aside from the almost-irrelevant example of naval<br>
technology, the fact still remains that life during the Pax<br>
Romana was far superior to life during the so-called Dark Ages.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;attain. On the other hand, the welfare of the empire was guaranteed by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; emperors. If the money concentration got too big, they probably tried to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; redistribute it. Too bad they couldn't prevent it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the empire, 'bread and cicuses' were the only thing that kept the plebes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; check from revolting against the government. </i><br>
<p>
And the Praetorian guard. And the legions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; By 300 AD, 95% of the Roman legions</i><br>
<i>&gt; were not Citizens of Rome, but Barbarian conscripts. </i><br>
<p>
This is also not true. The Romans used barbarian auxiliaries in<br>
certain roles, but the legions were, on the whole, Roman. Or are<br>
you referring to the empire outside of the City of Rome as<br>
"barbarian"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The Christians murdered millions, buried the knowledge of the Romans and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; maintained power (and stagnation) for nearly one millenium. The Dark Ages</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; were the worst time this planet has ever gone through.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On the contrary, the Church was the only thing that preserved the knowledge of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Romans. </i><br>
<p>
The Church preserved -some- knowledge of it. But they vigorously<br>
suppressed any memes they disagreed with. I refer you to the<br>
Albigensian Crusade as an example. Most of the knowledge was<br>
preserved by the Arabs, actually, and filtered back into europe<br>
from the middle east.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While the Empire was stagnant, the middle ages was not caused by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the church, but by the pillaging and destruction of the Mongol Hordes, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Viking incursions, and the general migratory habits of the various tribes of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'barbarians' such as the Vandals, the Visigoths, the Angles, the Franks, etc.</i><br>
<p>
Sigh. Look, if you're ignorant of history, don't parade it.<br>
The mongols never made it past Vienna. In fact I don't think they<br>
made it *to* Vienna. The Vikings never went much further than up<br>
rivers, unless they came to settle, and even then they did not<br>
penetrate very far inland. The "barbarians" you refer to were<br>
responsible for the destruction of Rome, and the chaos of what is<br>
referred to as the "Dark Ages". By the mediaeval period these<br>
barbarian hordes had happily settled down and become good little<br>
europeans, and were known as the English, the French etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Oh, so you are a spiritualist. Sorry, wrong list for you. A Transhuman is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual who decides to and undertakes the individual work necessary to move</i><br>
<i>&gt; beyond the common human state. </i><br>
<p>
Well, this is your description, at any rate.  i'd simply say it<br>
is someone who has progressed beyond being merely human, and<br>
leave it at that. What if someone rocks up who has become a<br>
"transhuman" via military research?  Are they not transhuman<br>
because they didn't do it themselves? People work best when they<br>
work in groups.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is no fixed 'goalpost' to define a human vs. transhuman state. </i><br>
<p>
then why attempt to label it above?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; That's the failure, you know. The Americans didn't become a superpower</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; because they were so clever. They've earned a golden nose with both World</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Wars, whereas the British Empire was eliminated as a superpower already</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; after WW I. The German economy didn't fare so well after WW II because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; politicians were so intelligent, but because it was greatly funded by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; US.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which, you must admit, is a far far different thing than winning a war, n'est</i><br>
<i>&gt; pas? When ever in human history has a victor so completely rebuilt a former</i><br>
<i>&gt; enemy (nay, three former enemies, Germany, Italy, and Japan) so that they become</i><br>
<i>&gt; less than 40 years after the war, economic rivals once again? </i><br>
<p>
This was not done out of altruism, but to defeat the Soviets.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is the genius</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the generosity and magnanimity of what you call 'selfish, greedy, capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; Amerika'. Winning a mere war was not the trick. Winning the peace was.</i><br>
<p>
Ah. Um. generosity and magnanimity. right. If this was the case,<br>
then we wouldn't see examples of american bastardry against other<br>
states would we? But we do. It was, as we all know, an entirely<br>
selfish exercise to contain the soviet threat in eastern Europe,<br>
in much the same manner as the unnecessary nuking of Japan was a<br>
warning to the soviets.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; History could also look completely different, if, after WW I, Germany had</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; decided to cooperate with Russia. Such a plan was made, by Weimar state</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; secretary Rathenau. Remember the contract of Rapallo? It allowed the Germans</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to quit reparation payments and to build and test weapons in the SU.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately (probably), Rathenau was assassinated in 1922.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; All that would have meant would be that the US would have come into the war</i><br>
<i>&gt; earlier on the side of Britain, and when we won, we would have also been able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; get the damn Soviet Union out of the way then rather than 50 years later.</i><br>
<p>
Why would the US have come in earlier? Because it would have lost<br>
the Soviet weapons market?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Evolution is the survival of the lifeform which fits itself best into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; environment. In cultural evolution, the environment is information,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; memetics, an ever-changing flux. Neither the better one nor the more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unscrupulous one will win in the end -- the end is open. Makes things a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; little more exciting, doesn't it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So you admit that cultural evolution is "a long row of bad coincidences,</i><br>
<i>&gt; backstabbings, and battle for power"? If this is so, why do you say that "power</i><br>
<i>&gt; structures need to end" for human evolution to occur?</i><br>
<p>
Because without this scrabbling for power we'd have evolved a lot<br>
further than we have to date.  Look at how long it took Europe to<br>
climb back up after the fall of Rome.<br>
