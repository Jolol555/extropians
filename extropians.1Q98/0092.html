"Played around" is the operative phrase- it consists mostly of ideas<br>
and a few tests in some of my animation software (RayDream 5,<br>
Trispectives 2).<br>
One version has morphing objects moving along a time axis, affecting<br>
each other in various ways. A more ambitious version would have<br>
physics-like<br>
interactivity among the items (e.g. ideas bounce of each other, new tech<br>
squeezes<br>
out old). <br>
Some work has been done on connecting the objects<br>
with colored lines and with transparent rods (etc.) having their own<br>
attributes.<br>
It is these connections, and how they grow and interweave over time, <br>
that is of most interest.<br>
<p>
Some reasons for using animation software:<br>
Being able to turn features such as detail levels, whole layers,<br>
attributes, etc.<br>
on and off is very appealing for a user interested in particular<br>
aspects.<br>
Picking camera angles and trajectories is also very heplful- immersive<br>
VR would<br>
be even better.<br>
<p>
Two major problems with this idea:<br>
Representing abstract concepts with 3D objects. Making them out of text<br>
helps<br>
a little, but screen resolution is a constraint.<br>
Picking what the other two axes represent (I have a most unfortunate<br>
disability:<br>
visualizing multidimensional structures is nearly impossible.)<br>
Picking multiple views helps a little, using an axis for more than one<br>
aspect<br>
helps sometimes, using layers gets confusing.<br>
<p>
One project I would like to do is to represent the past history of<br>
science and technology this way (I don't have the time for this,<br>
though), as a means of <br>
developing a future technology visual aid. The vacuum tube, for example,<br>
is <br>
represented as threads of icons in the 19th century and earlier (light<br>
bulb, vacuum pump, etc.) that coalesce into a tube icon near the turn of<br>
the 20th century. New <br>
threads spring from this, for triodes,<br>
pentodes, Klystrons, etc. These merge with other threads to form radio<br>
amps,<br>
radar, etc. Then most fade away with the advent of the transistor.<br>
