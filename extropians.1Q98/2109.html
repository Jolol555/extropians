<i>&gt; The only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;rational reason why someone would want to die is unbearable (mental or </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;physical) suffering. If this can't be cured by today's medicine, euthanasia</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;at some point in the future, he will be cured of all his physical and mental</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;disorders, *and* he'll be hedonistically engineered so that satisfaction is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;guaranteed. And on this day, he will surely thank you from saving him</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;from himself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Er, yes, but it's not quite that simple, is it?</i><br>
Um, no, of course not. I was mainly talking philosophically...<br>
Nevertheless:<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 1) Cryonic suspension costs $30,000 - $100,000 dollars or more. </i><br>
<i>&gt;    Do you have that kind of money lying around?</i><br>
No, but I do have +- $450 a year lying around to pay for my suspension<br>
contract and life insurance. Unfortunately, not everybody has the foresight<br>
to do this, although a lot of people have life insurance that might be used<br>
to pay the approx. $ 30.000 required by Cryonics Institute. Of course<br>
their relatives would have to co-operate and all, but if you know that someone<br>
is going to kill himself in advance, some of these matters might be settled.<br>
Another possibility would be freezing them yourself (with the aid of local<br>
cryonicists) and storing at least the brains in a small liquid nitrogen dewar,<br>
or in dry ice. I don't know whether or not this is legal in England (it isn't<br>
in Holland), but things like this can be done in relative secrecy if no other<br>
options are available. Maybe you could work out a settlement with a cryonics<br>
company later (raise the $30.000 over a couple of years), and have the <br>
remains transferred to a professional facility. All very difficult, but worth a<br>
try if you really care about someone.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 2) Euthanasia is illegal in most countries in the world, and is </i><br>
<i>&gt;    expensive and takes a long time in places where it isn't. If </i><br>
<i>&gt;    you're suicidal for purely psychological rather than </i><br>
<i>&gt;    physiological reasons, you likely don't want to wait around </i><br>
<i>&gt;    whilst a judge signs you off.</i><br>
Well, the good thing with suicide is that you don't need anyone's<br>
permission to do it. Personally, I wouldn't bother to get the state's<br>
blessing to kill myself if I felt like it; I'd just do it (and it wouldn't<br>
cost a penny). Btw, euthanasia is almost legal in Holland, so come <br>
over here, smoke a joint and than kill yourself, if you still feel like it ;-)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In practical terms, when a real, every-day person is rational but suicidal,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think you either have to let them go, or lock them up. I wondered whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; the group would favour me in imposing my will on someone else because I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't want them to die.</i><br>
Try every available (and affordable) therapy (Prozac?), and if this fails only let <br>
them go if there is no way you can get them into a dewar in time. Saving <br>
someone so that he may experience perfect health (and more) in the future <br>
can never be immoral, but then again that's just my opinion.<br>
