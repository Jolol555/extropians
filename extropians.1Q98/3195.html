You might want to consider stock index options. You can bet that the market<br>
will climb, fall, or either over a certain period by at least a certain<br>
amount. You would probably want to purchase these options as early as<br>
possible, but the earlier you buy - the higher the premium. Read up on it.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Personally, I'm shocked at the lack of press coverage over the Y2k</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; problem. As many of you CS know, its only a matter of time now before</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; our country and many of the worlds economic structures take their worst</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; beatings in history. Does anyone know of a website which organizes the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; information in a professional/scientific assessment?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I've only heard a little in the press. This is probably because they</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; don't want to exacerbate the problem by having people with lots of money</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; withdrawing their portions from the world banks.. but that's only a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; small part of the hysteria this computer malfunction could bring on..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But how bad will it really be? How will the y2k problem affect simple</i><br>
<i>&gt;things like your PC, web access and email? For example, can we</i><br>
<i>&gt;expect this list to crash? (now *there's* something really serious)...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Something else: everybody's talking about the negative sides of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;alleged crash, but as with most disasters there must be ways to</i><br>
<i>&gt;(greatly) profit from it. Although most people got hit in for example</i><br>
<i>&gt;the crash of '29, some became millionaires overnight. There must be</i><br>
<i>&gt;ways to profit from the (potential) chaos that will follow the y2k</i><br>
<i>&gt;problem, and not just as a programmer. It would be stupid to let</i><br>
<i>&gt;a golden opportunity like this one pass...Any suggestions? ;-)</i><br>
