     Scientists Extend The Life Span Of Human Cells <br>
<p>
DALLAS -- Jan. 13, 1998 -- Researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center<br>
at Dallas and their colleagues at Geron Corp., Menlo Park, Calif., say<br>
they have figured out how to overcome the mechanisms that control cellular <br>
aging and extend the life span of human cells. <br>
<p>
In the Jan. 16 issue of Science, Drs. Woodring Wright and Jerry Shay, UT<br>
Southwestern professors of cell biology and neuroscience, and their<br>
collaborators report finding that the enzyme telomerase -- which UT<br>
Southwestern scientists call a "cellular fountain of youth" -- causes<br>
human cells grown in the laboratory to retain their "youth" and continue<br>
to divide long past the time when they normally stop dividing.<br>
<p>
Normal human cells have a limited capacity to proliferate. After a certain<br>
finite number of cell divisions, time on the biological clock runs out;<br>
the cells "age" and stop dividing. Time remaining in a cell's life<br>
correlates with the length of the telomeres -- repeated sequences of DNA<br>
on the ends of chromosomes that protect the tips from degradation. In<br>
normal cells, telomeres shorten with each cell division. Although some<br>
have thought that this telomere shortening might be the biological clocks<br>
control mechanism, the hypothesis was controversial. The research now <br>
proves that human cells grow older each time they divide because their<br>
telomeres shorten. <br>
<p>
Specialized reproductive cells and most cancer cells appear to divide <br>
indefinitely. They contain the enzyme telomerase, which adds back<br>
telomeric DNA to the ends of chromosomes. Most normal cells do not have<br>
this enzyme. <br>
<p>
"We have found that cellular aging can be bypassed by the introduction of<br>
the catalytic component of the immortalizing enzyme telomerase," Shay<br>
said. "The expression of telomerase LIFE SPAN -- 2in normal human cells<br>
should extend their lifespan indefinitely. From a basic research point of<br>
view, we could begin to replace the abnormal tumor-cell lines now being<br>
used to study biochemical and physiological aspects of growth and<br>
differentiation with normal, yet immortal cell lines." <br>
<p>
The scientists introduced telomerase into normal human cells to see if the<br>
cells' life spans could be prolonged. The cells with telomerase extended<br>
the length of their telomeres, divided for 20 additional generations past<br>
the time they normally would stop dividing and are continuing to divide.<br>
The cells also grew and divided in a normal manner, giving rise to normal<br>
cells with the normal number of chromosomes. By all accounts these cells<br>
had found their fountain of youth. <br>
<p>
"The extension of normal cell lifespan in a youthful state by telomerase<br>
is a dramatic confirmation of the telomere hypothesis and one that<br>
presents numerous opportunities for biotechnology and medicine," said Dr.<br>
Calvin Harley, Geron vice president and chief scientific officer. <br>
<p>
One immediate use of finding that telomere shortening controls cellular<br>
aging may be in the area of producing engineered products in human cells.<br>
Instead of using uncharacterized primary human-cell cultures to produce <br>
vaccines or other biological products, one should now be able to produce<br>
products in a re-engineered normal human cell-type that does not change,<br>
Wright said. <br>
<p>
"This research raises the possibility that we could take a patient's own<br>
cells, rejuvenate them, then modify the cells as needed and give them back<br>
to the patient to treat a variety of genetic and other diseases," Wright<br>
said. "The potential long-term applications are simply staggering." <br>
<p>
Other investigators on the project included Drs. Andrea Bodnar, Maria <br>
Frolkis, Choy-Pik Chiu, Gregg B. Morin, Calvin Harley and Serge<br>
Lichtsteiner of Geron Corp.; and Drs. Michel Ouellette and Shawn Holt,<br>
research fellows in UT Southwestern's Department of Cell Biology and<br>
Neuroscience. The research was funded in part by the National Institutes<br>
of Health. <br>
