You are correct.  What we currently call "capitalism" is a engineered<br>
way of <br>
<p>
making people be productive, and it should set libertarian<br>
coercometers to overload.  However, when most people on this list talk<br>
about "capitalism" they are talking of a system that measures a<br>
persons worth rather than forcing equality, which I agree with.  In<br>
this sense it could also be the lack of any system (i.e. natural<br>
selection.)<br>
<p>
At the moment you could probably live for quite a long time for free,<br>
in the future that time will be longer, one day you may even be able<br>
to stretch to immortality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Therefore,  it is not logical to say that the ONLY ALTERNATIVE to </i><br>

<p>
No, robots could do it for us!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In a Robotopia, only the robots,  which may soon provide humans a</i><br>
bounty<br>
<i>&gt; of whatever we desire absolutely free,  could be considered slaves.</i><br>
<p>
And if robots are productive, then our economy needs to incourage<br>
creativity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Next, look at what is happening in the browser wars.</i><br>
<p>
Not you as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Last week, Netscape anounced it will also give away its browser, plus</i><br>
<i>&gt; make the source code for Version 5 available free to world on its </i><br>
<i>&gt; website.  Good old capitalist competition is at work again, driving</i><br>
costs<br>
<i>&gt; for browser users to zero. . .absolutely FREE. . .</i><br>
<p>
Well, Netscape thinks there isn't any money in clients, it thinks the<br>
money is in servers.  They also think that this is what Microsoft<br>
thinks, but they're wrong on both counts.  Servers will be short lived<br>
(thanks, to the wonder of decentralisation) and Microsoft already knows.<br>
<p>
Microsoft is actually in a money making frenzy, because they can see<br>
the market is collapsing around them.  At the same time they're trying<br>
to route themselves into the Web and whatever new economy it may<br>
produce.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Look at the web itself.  From the users point of view, there are</i><br>
tremendous<br>
<i>&gt; amounts of goods and services that are already absolutely free.  Look </i><br>
<i>&gt; around the fast changing, high tech world we all share.  It is not</i><br>
much of<br>
<i>&gt; a stretch  to say:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; " Perhaps we should all realize that capitalism will soon become an</i><br>
<i>&gt; absurdity and cease to exist. . ."</i><br>
<p>
There will still be an 'economy' (in the sense that we will still be<br>
able to apply economics to it, although a purpose built system of<br>
trade may not exist.)  What people tend to forget is that the Web *is*<br>
an economy in itself (at an early stage of creation.)  What this<br>
economy will look like I'm not completely sure, any ideas?<br>
