Thank you for the information about Julian Simon, Max.  I get the<br>
impression that he did at least think about cryonics.  I met him many<br>
years ago at some post-lecture cocktail thing, and he was in a<br>
charming mood, making little bon mots about a variety of topics,<br>
when someone asked him 'hey, what about that cryonics thing?' He<br>
stopped for a long moment, and his eyes got serious--I thought he<br>
was going to say something.  Then he turned to me, winked, and<br>
changed the subject.  <br>
<p>
The aspect of this situation that saddens me is last month's study<br>
results that indicate that persons suffering from untreated<br>
depression are up to 40% more prone to heart attack.  It's not just<br>
a mental problem--it has serious effects on the body as well.  His<br>
life could have been prolonged if only he had sought proper<br>
treatment. <br>
<p>
sin,<br>
