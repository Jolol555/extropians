From: Mark D. Fulwiler &lt;mfulwiler@earthlink.net&gt;<br>
We have all heard the libertarian and anti-libertarian arguments and<br>
<i>&gt;rehashing them really is a waste of time.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree.   While I have also heard these arguments many times before, this is<br>
the first time I have seen them discussed in depth by extropians.  When I joined<br>
this list I was already convinced of the tech/trans humanist side of<br>
extropianism but from lurking and occasionally contributing I have found that<br>
even some of my political views have changed because of the well thought out<br>
arguments presented here.<br>
<p>
Not that I had far to go anyway, I've got a pre-existing strong crypto-anarchist<br>
tendency, but a good example is the issue of gun control.  Many would remember<br>
that this featured for a while on this list.<br>
I do not live in the USA, my country has only a small fraction of the crime and<br>
violence, so I've always though that gun control is the best way of keeping our<br>
country from following the USA down these roads.  As a result I have always<br>
opposed wide scale  ownership of high-powered firearms.<br>
<p>
I don't know if I'm a better extropian for it, but Michael Lorrey has convinced<br>
me to buy a gun and stockpile other defensive measures.  I'm still against<br>
widespread ownership of guns, but only for *everyone else*, not for *me*.<br>
<p>
Bytes are cheap and easily recycled.  Let them chatter about welfare states a<br>
bit more,  I've got some other long held beliefs that I think are in need of an<br>
update.<br>
