<i>&gt; &gt;I think this is wrong, since the genetic information is just the basic</i><br>

<i>&gt; I agree. The problem, ofcourse, is that inputs arrive even during </i><br>
<i>&gt; the embryonic growth of the brain. However (theoretically) even </i><br>
<i>&gt; these imputs could be simulated. </i><br>
<p>
My guess is that these inputs are fairly easy to deal with compared to<br>
the inputs that appear later; at this point they are mainly chemical<br>
and temperature signals. Things get more complex later.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;That makes 10 million axons of sensory information. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;normal activity for neurons lie beneath 1 KHz, so an upper bound on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the input would be 10 billion bits/s.</i><br>
<i>&gt; When uncompressed...</i><br>
<p>
The big question is of course the coding. If it is just frequency<br>
coding, then we will have a huge compression ratio. Phase coding would<br>
complicate things a bit. But assuming only spikes are relevant, then<br>
one could code a signal as (spike at axon N at time T), replacing<br>
around a thousand values per axon per second with tens to a hundred of<br>
values (depending on activity), creating an compression ratio of<br>
0.1-0.01.<br>
<p>
(but never trust this kind of computer science estimate for the CNS; I<br>
have already started to think that nature has gone out of its way to<br>
surprise and complicate things for us scientists)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;My personal estimate for the human capacity is around a bit per</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;synapse (based on assumptions from neural networks), there are around</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;10^14 synapses, making a capacity of around 10^14 bits. </i><br>
<i>&gt; And what about the information required to store which connection </i><br>
<i>&gt; the synapses belong to. I.e which other neuron each dendrite is </i><br>
<i>&gt; connected to.</i><br>
<p>
Good point, I overlooked that. That would take log2(10^11) =~36 bits<br>
per synapse. Interesting, it seems that there may be more information<br>
in the connectivity than in the exact synaptic values.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I assumed the neural network of the brain can be </i><br>
<i>&gt; simulated by a deterministic system. (i.e. that a selfconsiousnes </i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence can be created by a deterministic system) </i><br>
<i>&gt; This has ofcourse not been proven but seems quite likely. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some persons claim that some internal randomness should be </i><br>
<i>&gt; inherent for generating selfconsiousness intelligence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However others claim that the random noise input from the </i><br>
<i>&gt; environment is sufficent.</i><br>
<p>
Just having internal randomness is not enough, since it can be<br>
emulated by a deterministic system with a look-up table. It seems<br>
obvious that one random look-up table would do just as well as another<br>
with the same statistical properties, so in that case it could be<br>
generated using pseudorandom numbers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That the human consiousness could be transferred to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; deterministic system is unacceptable to some people </i><br>
<i>&gt; because it kind of reduces themselves to machines...?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, many people seem to dislike the idea immensely. I see it the<br>
other way around: instead of seeing us as mere machines, the "mere<br>
machines" can in fact be equal to us!<br>
