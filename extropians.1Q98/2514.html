(sorry for eating up all this bandwith folks, and yes I realize it's not<br>
nice to kick someone when he's down but I don't take lightly to being<br>
called a nazi)<br>
<p>
 At 18:44 5-03-98 -0500, <br>
<i> &gt;If so-called "rational" extropians cannot discuss the definition of human</i><br>
<i> &gt;without resorting to vitriol, irrational ethical emotivism and kneejerk</i><br>
<i> &gt;bigotry,</i><br>
<p>
I have never claimed to be either rational or extropian. I do however most<br>
strongly claim _not_ to be a bigot, racist or nazi.<br>
<p>
 //snipped a rather emotional rant//<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;As to what Roe v. Wade legalized, I'll stand by my original post, this is</i><br>
<i> &gt;the law of the land. </i><br>
<p>
Again, if you feel the US law making proces if failing for whatever reason<br>
that's too bad (you may even be right - I can't tell), I suggest you go<br>
into politics or something and do something about it instead of accusing<br>
others of nazism and whatnot. <br>
<p>
 //snipped more references to nazi-Germany //<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The arguments for rape, incest, life-of-the-mother and fatal defects are</i><br>
<i> &gt;rational, even if they prescribe tragic consequences.  These can be worked</i><br>
<i> &gt;out, jurisdiction by jurisdiction.  But in America, they amount to roughly</i><br>
<i> &gt;3% of all abortions.  It is not rational to open the sluiceway to the</i><br>
<i> &gt;culture of death to deal with small numbers of exceptional cases.</i><br>
<p>
I guess the view from the Ivory Tower is still beautiful, how is anyone<br>
going to distinction between:<br>
"A 16-year old girl who was raped by her retarded brother but refuses to<br>
press official charges and is 4 months pregnant"<br>
And<br>
"A 16-year old girl who claimes to have been raped by her retarded brother<br>
but refuses to press official charges and is 4 months pregnant"<br>
<p>
If one is allowed, the other is also and you're back at free choich again.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;As to moving to the Vatican, I don't think we can squeeze 5 billion people</i><br>
<i> &gt;into a postage-stamp size country.</i><br>
<p>
Suggestion:<br>
If you go there, most other people won't, and everyone will be happy.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Do you grasp that you and your fellow travelers are arrogantly</i><br>
<i> &gt;forcing your definition on everyone else, with the exception of the one</i><br>
<i> &gt;ghetto you'll allow us, the Vatican?</i><br>
<p>
&lt;rant-mode&gt;<br>
Look pall, you can live anywhere you want as far as I'm concerned. And even<br>
if you, your daughter or granma get knocked up by a whole soccer team of<br>
down-syndrome patients no-one will force you to have an abortion. In most<br>
countries society wil even pay for taking care of your children should you<br>
become unable to do so. No-one will complain about the cost that you bring<br>
to society when you exercised your right to have 12 children with<br>
down-syndrome. Those children will be loved and cared for as long as possible.<br>
However, if you get it in your head to interfere in any way with anyone<br>
else who is excercising their right _not_ to have a child you'll be in big<br>
trouble.<br>
&lt;/rant-mode&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;It is very intersting to see which of my points and questions go</i><br>
<i> &gt;unanswered. The silence is deafening.</i><br>
<p>
Often on this list that is the signal saying 'please shut up, you're noise'<br>
Maybe the more distinguised listmembers are telling us something by<br>
not-reacting, by not _even_ reacting when you accuse them of bigotry. It's<br>
a proces called ignoring, you may have experienced it before.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I don't count ethical emotivism as</i><br>
<i> &gt;containing any answers, only personal expressions of feelings, and</i><br>
<i> &gt;individuals who use feelings as a moral guide are little better than slaves</i><br>
<i> &gt;responding to their masters' instruction of what *to* feel.</i><br>
<p>
Well, it's a good thing that you keep track of these issues for us 'cause<br>
being mere slaves to our feelings and emotions most of us are of course<br>
totally unable.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;This goes unanswered:</i><br>
<i> &gt;RJ: &lt;What's wrong with commercializing all life, at all stages of</i><br>
<i> &gt;development, including humans, intelligent or otherwise, conscious or</i><br>
<i> &gt;otherwise? Just make all life into products in the marketplace, all custom</i><br>
<i> &gt;designed for any use whatsoever?  "If destroying it is acceptable," why</i><br>
<i> &gt;would any use not be, living or dead?&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Because when you make a distiction between living organisms and consious<br>
beings it is clear that the commercial use of the first might be<br>
accepetable in some cases while we have no practical alternatives, whereas<br>
the commercial usage of consious beings is totally unacceptable. That's<br>
just my opinion.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;P.S. Thanks to Gene Leitl for pointing out the obvious re: future master</i><br>
<i> &gt;races giving short shrift to lowly humans. I would add that we should</i><br>
<i> &gt;expect them to be giving especially short shrift to humans who have</i><br>
<i> &gt;exhibited a pronounced death fetish regarding the weak. Not a good example</i><br>
<i> &gt;to our masterful progeny who may very well view *us* as embryonic.</i><br>
<p>
Wich is precisely the reason you should start practicing respectful<br>
interaction with consious beings who are not human in the biological sense.<br>
50 years from now someone else might be at the top of the foodchain, they<br>
could be fully _digital_, and they'll have web-acces to Exi archives. And<br>
they will be aware of you utter disrespect for non-meat, non-analog<br>
consious systems. Think about it.<br>
