  IAN: It just occured to me that there is an identity<br>
  (same as) relation between the more-logical theories<br>
  of self or "soul" and the definition of art I stated.<br>
<p>
  The most persuasive argument about the nature of the <br>
  individual "soul" that I've heard is that it is more <br>
  than the atoms of which the brain is composed, but<br>
  this "more" is not a supernatural spirit, it's simply<br>
  the ordering of those atoms. I recall reading in the <br>
  journal Free Inquiry that the soul is likened to the <br>
  difference between a pile of lumber and bricks (atoms)<br>
  and a constructed house (brain). So the house is more <br>
  than its elements, but to assume that this "more" is <br>
  a spirit, a ghost in the machine, is an illusion. <br>
<p>
  OK, so if art is properly defined as "an ordering of <br>
  material and/or electrical elements that is greater <br>
  than the sum of those elements and causes sensual<br>
  experience" and if consciousness is also properly <br>
  defined as "an ordering of material and/or electrical <br>
  elements that is greater than the sum of those ele-<br>
  ments and causes sensual experience," then lo and<br>
  behold, it follows directly that art = consciousness.<br>
<p>
  The statement that "art expresses who you are" is<br>
  such a truism it draws a yawn, but the logical iden-<br>
  tity I just proposed between art and consciousness <br>
  would map a most profound example of that truism. <br>
  It would therefore truly follow in the most intimate <br>
  way that understanding what is art is integral to <br>
  understanding what it is to be a human and thus what <br>
  it will take to become a transhuman, since the mech-<br>
  anical replication of consciousness/art is the corner-<br>
  stone of the quest for the transhumanist liberation.<br>
