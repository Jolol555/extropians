<p>
If most people (both poor and rich) make their decisions rationally and<br>
based on their long-term interests and those interests are best served by a<br>
libertarian style of governing then why aren't the libertarian parties huge?<br>
<p>
Two possibilities (AFAIKT):<br>
<p>
1. Most people do not make al of their decisions rationally and don't<br>
always take their long-term interests into consideration. This would<br>
explain why there are still many people smoking cigarettes, climbing<br>
mountians and riding bikes without a helmet.<br>
<p>
2. Libertarianism is not in the best interest of most people and they vote<br>
accordingly (for a minority group it is, or seems to be, in their best<br>
interests and they also vote accordingly).<br>
<p>
Personally I think it's a combination of both. If a true libertarian party<br>
wins a national election in the US or a major European country and that<br>
country is still well (preferrebly better) after few years I'll change my<br>
opinion and congratulate everybody on this list who had more foresight than<br>
I did.<br>
<p>
Untill then,<br>
Greetings<br>
