The Visual programming kits do help, but dynamic(?) changes require a <br>
smaller, interpreted widget (eg. JAVA). Agent programming is getting very <br>
close to adapt it's processing to the user by interface. As a S/W <br>
developer, I still look at the "Jordi LaForge" type of programming - Rapid <br>
development, able to interface w/any type of machine or system, small (and <br>
cool looking).<br>

<i>&gt;What I was thinking would be a high priority for software development</i><br>
<i>&gt;companies is a form of semi-automated programming software.  Basically,</i><br>
<i>&gt;this would be a very high-level programming language which could help</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;programmer do in little time what previously took hours of coding.</i><br>
<p>
Some stuff like this already exists, though probably not on the scale<br>
you're thinking of. Rapid Application Development (RAD) systems<br>
like Microsoft Visual C++, Visual Basic, and Borland C++Builder, as<br>
well as Delphi, automate the tiresome task of writing user interface<br>
code for GUIs, allowing the programmer to concentrate on "event<br>
handlers", little chunks of code that get called when user interface<br>
elements (buttons, etc) get pushed.<br>
<p>
I don't know if these sorts of things have been extended beyond UI<br>
programming tho.<br>
