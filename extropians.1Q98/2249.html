<i>&gt; With all this talk about "Virtual Obsession" spreading memes, it makes me</i><br>

<i>&gt; I have been taping them weekly for a couple of months.  They have had</i><br>
<i>&gt; episodes about the following subjects:</i><br>
/snip/<br>
<i>&gt; My favorite part about the series is that each episode is written by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; different author and has a different point of view and different</i><br>
<i>&gt; characters.  Unlike Babylon 5, Star Trek(s) and X-Files, which are all</i><br>
<i>&gt; locked into the same characters and the same tired points of view, these</i><br>
<i>&gt; are different points of view every time.</i><br>
The only problem with The Outer Limits is (IMHO) that the series lacks style.<br>
It's just one of those X-Files ripoffs (or so it seems), with wooden acting, bad<br>
lighting, weak storylines etc. They just annoy the hell out of me, so I hardly<br>
ever watch (and never on purpose). Something about that series screams<br>
"fake", but it's hard to pinpoint what *exactly* the difference is with the X-Files<br>
(that I watch every week -- yes, shame on me). Ambiance I guess...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; It may be more effective to spread memes via a TV series rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual movies.  Then we could have a different author and story idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; every week.</i><br>
A good idea. But be sure to hire the X-files team for the rest.<br>
<p>
P.s: Millenium isn't total crap, but it certainly hasn't the X-Files brand<br>
of quality. Maybe it's just too hard to care about the depressing ex-cop<br>
and his "perfect loving family". Yech! [vomiting noises]<br>
