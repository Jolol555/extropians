I don't find Dr. Mills' credentials or his theory very impressive.<br>
<p>
He's a medical doctor, with no degree in physics.  He has created a theory<br>
that says that the electrons in hydrogen atoms can drop to lower than<br>
the standard lowest-energy orbital, when interacting with a "secret"<br>
catalyst that he has invented.  This releases heat, so he is trying to<br>
get people to invest in his mysterious energy-production technology.<br>
<p>
He runs these chambers with hydrogen gas and his catalyst.  He has to<br>
input heat to ionize the hydrogen, but when he measures heat output it<br>
seems like more is coming out than was going in.<br>
<p>
This is very similar to the cold fusion story.  Doing calorimetry<br>
(measuring heat in and out) accurately is much more difficult than<br>
non-specialists realize.  It is easy to get false results by not<br>
accounting for all the changes properly.  There is also the possibility<br>
that some chemical reaction is occuring with the hydrogen.<br>
<p>
The hydrogen atom is the most thoroughly studied in physics.  The chances<br>
that some chemical interaction can cause electrons to take up orbitals<br>
forbidden by quantum mechanics, but that nobody else has noticed it before<br>
this MD did, seem impossibly small.<br>
<p>
The secrecy, the attempts to raise money by claiming a virtually<br>
inexhaustable source of energy, setting up a business rather than doing<br>
conventional scientific research, all point to it being a scam.<br>
