Um, I don't think we'll ever see mass uploading (First Power doomsday<br>
argument and all that) but maximal automatization could solve most<br>
of the welfare-related problems. Basically, what people want and need <br>
aren't jobs or even money but material goods like food, clothes and <br>
housing (duh indeed ;-) I think we already have the technological means<br>
to mass-produce these things at extremely low costs. Only a couple<br>
of % of a modern state's citizens are farmers, and usually these produce<br>
more food than necessary. So...automate even further and make the<br>
basic stuff _totally free_, just hand it out to all who are needy. Just like<br>
in ancient Rome. Hell, why not have a modern equivalent of the games<br>
too? People could volunteer to fight eachother, and the winners would<br>
be paid from the revenues of tickets, cable rights, merchandise etc.<br>
This and state-run lotteries and the like could also help to subsidize<br>
the free-stuff factories (it beats taxes), that aren't too expensive to begin <br>
with due to the high degree of automatization. <br>
<p>
Would a system like this crash because everybody would just sit on their<br>
ass? I don't think so, because many people want more than just free<br>
food and housing (non-essentials would still have to be bought). So<br>
they'll work, and push society forwards. The others could sit home<br>
(or at football matches or maybe even in mass-produced VR-machines)<br>
and live a life relatively free of hunger and disease, with TV, VR and <br>
dope to add to the happiness.<br>
<p>
Later, with the advent of nanotech things would get easier still, but the<br>
point is that it can be done with *today's* tools, if only we lose that<br>
"the people must have work-meme". A nice side-effect of a system<br>
like this would be quicker progress due to the stimulation of <br>
cheap, reliable automated systems instead of artificially holding them<br>
back to save obsolete jobs. Also, with most "dumb jobs" automated<br>
the world would become more user friendly because machines never<br>
strike or have a bad day, and require no handling-etiquette whatsoever.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; While this seems more appealing at first, keep in mind the costs of</i><br>

<i>&gt; anything, it seems we should take our foot off the brakes NOW so as to</i><br>
<i>&gt; reach immortality as quickly as possible, if our goal is to minimize death.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, we need immortality too of course, in fact, it's one of my top priorities.<br>
Save for some 1000 people or so, the rest doesn't seem to agree however...  <br>
