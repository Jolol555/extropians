More and more companies are downsizing.<br>
<p>
More and more people are working for themselves, and many are [or want<br>
to] work out of their homes.<br>
<p>
There are something like 80,000,000 users of the Internet today, and the<br>
Net is a wild, crazy ever-changing, anarchistic baby that seems to be<br>
living in the days of the Wild West!  There are no rules, because<br>
technology keeps changing the playing field.<br>
<p>
So how can an individual work from home and take advantage of the Net?<br>
<p>
Its hard.  Really hard.  If you are selling a service, or a product, and<br>
you are not a large company, just what can you do?<br>
<p>
Email.<br>
<p>
Spam?  No - responsible email, with no hype, no lies, no bull.  Yes,<br>
there are some who say that ANY form of unsolicited email is illegal.<br>
Wrong!!!<br>
<p>
A landmark decision in the State of Washington recently determined that<br>
bulk email advertising is absolutely legal and proper.  No state or<br>
federal court has ruled otherwise.<br>
<p>
So, by using responsible email, you can reach that huge market at a<br>
fraction of the cost of traditional bulk mail.  Less than 1/10th of a<br>
cent per address...<br>
<p>
We will send 100,000 pieces of email for just $99 with up to one full<br>
page of text. The only other limitation is that it cannot be a chain letter,<br>
pornography or hate mail.<br>
<p>
Drop us a line at &lt;A HREF=""&gt;goforit20@hotmail.com&lt;/A&gt;, or fax 561-835-0690, or call<br>
561-835-4077 and we will send complete details.<br>
<p>
Thanks for your time.<br>
<p>
Dave Kaplan, President<br>
