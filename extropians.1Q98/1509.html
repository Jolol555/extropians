<i>&gt; I've just completed reading "Prometheus Rising" by Robert Anton Wilson -</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I am *very* impressed and inspired by that book. I'd really</i><br>
<i>&gt; appreciate some opinions from other people on this list about that</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular book, since it's one of the "top-ten" books in the Extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt; Principles Reading List, and it basically says what you say.</i><br>
<p>
I think it is a good book. Not in the sense that it is 100% true and<br>
useful, but it is a good starting point in meta-programming. One has<br>
to keep a critical mind when reading it though, since a lot of the<br>
stuff Wilson claims is of a questionable nature or made up (he would<br>
say that this is the point, of course, but I think it is true even for<br>
some of the things he didn't plan as trickery).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the critical side, I can think of no way of "falsifying" most of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas in Prometheus Rising (except for Wilson's too optimistic view of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the future which was falsified by time). I'm afraid any attempt of</i><br>
<i>&gt; falsifying could be simply overcome by saying "this is dogmatic circuit</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3 (dogmatic rationalist) argueing". That puts up the question: how</i><br>
<i>&gt; useful are the models explained, to people who use them?</i><br>
<p>
The first four circuits are not very controversial, they exist in<br>
rephrased form in plenty of models for personality. Of course, one<br>
might argue that personality psychology is also filled with<br>
unfalsifiable propositions (I must admit that I do not have a high<br>
opinion of the field even after reading it as a part of my psychology<br>
studies). And remember that any model which explains away attempts to<br>
check it, especially by "ad hominem" explanations of why you are<br>
trying to check them, is very liable to contain mistakes or falsehoods<br>
that are never corrected. Such defenses against falsification should<br>
really be reasons to intensify scrutinity - what is the model hiding?<br>
<p>
I think the upper four circuits are not very well described (that is<br>
of course understandable, since they are outside normal experience)<br>
and unverified. The fifth circuit seems to have some basis in fact,<br>
during my studies in various subjects I have run into it, but the<br>
uppermost three might just be recurring myths among psychonauts,<br>
nothing real or useful at all.<br>
