I agree wt\ith you on this.  There is no certianty for the prohibition of<br>
transhuman/advanced technology, BUT there are two general<br>
sentiments at large which threaten us, and merit some attention.  One<br>
is technophobia, whether directed at all technology or at a particular<br>
set of technologies -- automobiles, genetic engineering, nuclear<br>
power, computers.  We've already discussed this one, but I've yet<br>
to see a clear plan or set of plans to combat it.<br>
<p>
The other is the desire to seek centrally planned solutions to any<br>
problems, real or imagined, from poverty to cloning.  This creates<br>
a culture in which people who fear technological progress or<br>
certain technologies often have the power to prevent others who<br>
have no such fears from using or advancing those very same<br>
technologies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My general outlook on the question whether transhumanist ideals will gain</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough acceptance to grow more or less unhindered (except where prohibited</i><br>
<i>&gt;by physical law) is a cost benefit analysis. Which is more trouble:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Establishing a physical space of refuge, terrestrial or otherwise, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;fighting/subverting political barriers.  Tough call.</i><br>
<p>
Of course, another alternative is to present faits accompli.  Clone people<br>
in huge numbers, then foist them upon society, for example.  (Sounds<br>
like a good idea for a science fiction story: a society where clones<br>
outnumber nonclones...)  In this way, political barriers can be ignored.<br>
<p>
Fastforward to the future!<br>
