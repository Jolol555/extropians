<p>
<p>
I examined the documentation of the university experiment out of curiousity.<br>
<p>
In short, the experimental results are worthless.  It's been many years<br>
since I last stepped into a chem lab, but the individual inolved clearly<br>
has only rudimentary knowledge of laboratory processes and a laughable<br>
grasp of the chemistry of the reaction he is observing.<br>
<p>
In this particular case, they were using hydrogen gas as the hydrogen<br>
source and KNO3 as a the catalyst source ( potassium is supposed to be the<br>
catalyst ).  <br>
<p>
1.  He only considers the formation of water and the formation of ammonia<br>
as sources of chemical energy.  This is clearly wrong.  First, ammonia<br>
can't be appreciably synthesized under the conditions the experiment.<br>
Second, the formation of water is not the most energetic reaction that<br>
would be occurring, yet he disregards the other highly exothermic reactions<br>
in the mix.  I might add that nasty nitrogen bi-products are very likely to<br>
be present in the instance that the experiment is actually working as<br>
advertised.  This is clearly not the case (mostly likely N2 in his<br>
experiment, which he doesn't mention despite the extreme exothermic heat of<br>
formation).<br>
<p>
2.  Platinum is well-known to catalyze all sorts of exothermic reactions in<br>
the presence of a hydrogen gas.  I wasn't paying a whole lot of attention<br>
at the time, but I distinctly remember a lecture during one of my former<br>
chemical engineering classes where the professor discussed at length the<br>
importance of keeping your gases clean/pure when doing platinum catalyzed<br>
hydrogen reactions.  In the experiment described, the experimenter appeared<br>
to be more concerned with whether or not he had hydrogen in the mix rather<br>
than the fact that he had a lot of other gases in the mix.  Stupid.<br>
<p>
3.  Knowing nothing else, if I was going to do the experiment, I would use<br>
solid potassium hydride in an extremely low pressure sealed system.  Not<br>
only would this eliminate a lot of interfering molecules, but would provide<br>
much more detailed and useful results.  KH also ionizes easier than KNO3.<br>
KH in a sealed very low pressure system would eliminate the probability<br>
that other chemical reactions were taking place.  <br>
<p>
(Note: This point alone makes me highly suspect of his claims.  The<br>
industrial synthesis of KH should have generated anomalous results if what<br>
he says is true.  The people who do industrial synthesis are maniacal<br>
energy accountants and would have noticed something awry a *long* time ago.)<br>
<p>
<p>
4.  A rudimentary chemical analysis of the resulting mix would almost<br>
certainly be enlightening.  Interestingly, there is no indication that they<br>
did any analysis of the residues or gases.  This is important, especially<br>
if they don't know what type of reaction is occurring.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
There are a lot more nit-picky things and lots of bad lab technique, but I<br>
think it is clear (at least to me) that these "experiments" were half-assed<br>
at best and in no way demonstrated anything.  After reading the lab reports<br>
of the experiments that supposedly verified his claim, I have to disregard<br>
him as being either a con-man or delusional.<br>
