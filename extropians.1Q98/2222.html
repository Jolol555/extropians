I think your missing a very important point here.  Regardless of what is fair<br>
compensation or not, the fact remains that the company has *taken away* money<br>
from a more a powerful group.  Because companies need IT workers more than IT<br>
workers need that company, why haven't IT workers realized that they are the<br>
ones who really have the power?  You would think, that based on the IT shortage<br>
trends, that IT workers would counter any company plot to exploit them.   Those<br>
with the testicles in their hands control those who own those testicles.   It<br>
just makes plain economic and political sense.<br>
