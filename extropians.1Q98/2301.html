Ian Goddard wrote 3/1/98: &lt;The most persuasive argument about the nature of<br>
the individual "soul" that I've heard is that it is more than the atoms of<br>
which the brain is composed, but this "more" is not a supernatural spirit,<br>
it's simply the ordering of those atoms.&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't know if "ordering" is the best term here, but definitely some<br>
concept that centers around what gives the collection of atoms, or quarks,<br>
or bits of substance (being), coherency.  IOW, why does this particular<br>
quark or bit of substance contribute to the subjective "I" and not the<br>
quark immediately next to it.<br>
<p>
Ian: &lt;It would therefore truly follow in the most intimate way that<br>
understanding what is art is integral to understanding what it is to be a<br>
human and thus what it will take to become a transhuman, since the<br>
mechanical replication of consciousness/art is the cornerstone of the quest<br>
for the transhumanist liberation.&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't think that art = consciousness holds up very well because art is<br>
only one category out of many that has consciousness as a prerequisite. <br>
Transhuman art will arise from expanded consciousness, which will arise<br>
from a deeper and broader grasp of the past, forming a larger springboard<br>
from which to jump farther into the future from.  I think that art will be<br>
seen, in retrospect, to be associated with the universal "beauty"<br>
regardless whether it is human art or posthuman art or alien art.  "The<br>
mechanical replication of consciousness/art" is what I call having<br>
children.  Having children is, in fact, a cornerstone of liberty, because<br>
of the responsibilities associated with child-rearing firmly attaching<br>
themselves to individual rights.  Rights without responsibilities is the<br>
opposite of liberation.<br>

Anders Sandberg wrote 3/1/98: &lt;(rule no. 1 of all propaganda: dehumanize<br>
your opponent)&gt;<br>
<p>
Exactly so, hence unborn children are referred to as viable tissue mass, or<br>
fetal material, all the better to encourage murder.  For the strong to prey<br>
on the weak, the weak must be defined as negligible.<br>
