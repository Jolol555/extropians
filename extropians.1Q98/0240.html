        Actually, for what it's worth, the person in question (his name<br>
escapes me at the moment) was shot from outside the prison.  Apparently he<br>
was walking in the chain-linked outdoor portion of the prison yard when he<br>
was killed.  However, the fact that a long-time assassination target such<br>
as he was given *any* exposure to the outside world defies easy<br>
explanation.  Perhaps the Irish government wanted him to be killed.<br>
