<i>&gt; Eugene Leitl, you have described what I call Funcloning as "neoluddism".</i><br>
<p>
No, Erik Moeller ;). What is 'fun'? Everything what we do is fun. Orelse<br>
we wouldn't be doing it. Maybe your idea of fun is different from the next<br>
guy's, so what. Whatever happened to laissez faire?<br>
<p>
A mentally intact clone has the same rights as a standard person in the<br>
belief system I currently subscribe to. Period. <br>
 <br>
Tinkering with human DNA to make Ubermenschen, or microcephalic clones for<br>
transplants is not viable with the shotgun genetic engineering approach we<br>
are now limited to. Tomorrow, who knows? The body is not sacred, the DNA<br>
is not sacred. The mind is, at least now. (Your mileage may vary).<br>
<p>
Personally, I find cloning pointless. Microcephalic self clones for<br>
transplantation purposes, maybe. I say the money would be far best spent<br>
in a better neurosuspension protocol.<br>
 <br>
I would find cloning far less pointless, if there was a durable<br>
(semibiological) artificial womb (obviously, I'm no Ixian purist), for it<br>
would open several new vistas, which would be exist otherwise. I would<br>
find it indeed very interesting, if there was a means to xerox adult<br>
individuals (something like the Visible Human, but a nanolitho hardcopy<br>
with _somewhat_ better resolution, and from better material than an<br>
executed defector). But if we can do that, we can dispense with the flesh<br>
altogether. Cloning _is_ pointless. Debates about cloning are doubly so.<br>
Yawn. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another fancy keyword. But who's the one who has fun here? Progress is</i><br>
<i>&gt; fine. </i><br>
<p>
About as fancy as 'funcloning', I guess. What's wrong with the term? <br>
Neoludd is more succinct then Shelley's 'peasants with torches' or<br>
'Webermob', while creating the appropriate associations.<br>
<p>
And progress is _always_ fine. Even it will mean the end of humankind as<br>
we know it. I never said I was not a technofashist, if you're so attached<br>
to them fancy keywords. So sue me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Cloning is OK if it is used by those who need it. But humans must not be</i><br>
<p>
Who should decide what constitutes need, and what is 'just for the heck of<br>
it'? Me? You? Newt Gingrich? The Pope?<br>
<p>
I tend to think that the Teutonic built-in-scissors-in-the-head attitude<br>
is fundamentally flawed. It ruins far more than it claims to accomplish.<br>
Tanstaafl. Wo gehobelt wird, da fallen auch Spaene. And sometimes even a<br>
trickle of blood. Obviously, it is a power lobby problem. Us or Them.<br>
Their numbers, and the kind of resources the other side is wielding<br>
considered, I find it more than ok to fight a bit dirty. (Which does not<br>
mean I join the extropian militia tomorrow. Maybe next week). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; made more product-like than they already are.  Otherwise your beloved</i><br>
<p>
If you feel like a product, that's your problem. I tend to find current<br>
reality oppressive -- a sufficient reason to work for a better tomorrow. <br>
As in: a chicken in every pot, a free upload for everyone. Nothing new? <br>
True. We are no evangelists here. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; singularity will remain a wet dream for your lifetime. </i><br>
<p>
Objects in this mirror may be larger than they appear. <br>
<p>
I never said Singularity will happen, or I indeed will live to see it. <br>
There will be saturation (almost certainly). There will be Butler's Jihad,<br>
probably.  I may die, and be not suspended. Maybe suspension does not<br>
work.  Maybe drextech does not work. Maybe the Singularity will kill us.<br>
Maybe, maybe, maybe. We'll live, and see. Then maybe we don't.<br>
<p>
The important point is: that we are alive. That these are the most<br>
exciting times so far in human history, which is not lessened by the fact<br>
that many generations could have claimed that. This is what matters. <br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
'gene<br>
<p>
P.S. Sorry for rant, but you had me nettled.<br>
