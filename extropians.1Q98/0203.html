Oh, sorry, the capacitor was on the magnetometer end. Every thing else<br>
was just to charge it. I don't have any of my notes from that project,<br>
and I was pretty much a party animal when I wasn't on duty, so my memory<br>
is fuzzy. Essentially, I just scaled up and altered a design for a small<br>
science class sized EMP generator I had seen the design for I think in<br>
one of Information Unlimited's books on funky highpower projects. As I<br>
recall, it put out a burst of around 70,000 watts for something like<br>
1/100th of a second. Thats about twice the power of an F-14's radar on<br>
max range. Needless to say, it was hazardous to people in the effect<br>
zone if they were not in the Faraday protection of a vehicle. <br>
<p>
THis is the major problem I have with what the people on the Discovery<br>
program were saying about it being "safe and harmless to vehicle<br>
passengers" (except those who have metal in their teeth or a hearing aid<br>
or pacemaker).The power densities needed to transmit a pulse fatal to<br>
circuits in that zone would also have an effect like a couple dozen to a<br>
few hundred chest xrays all at once to people not sitting inside a metal<br>
car body. THere is a reason why we weren't allowed to work in front of a<br>
fighter plane when its radar was being tested, as it could actually cook<br>
your insides like you were in a mocrowave oven if you were out in the<br>
open right in front of it. People inside plastic vehicles would have no<br>
protection, however, these devices may be of lower power if the chips<br>
used in cars these days operate at lower voltages.<br>
