Justice is punishing harmful acts in proportion to the crime and in a consequent<br>
manner.<br>

<p>
Punishments can be fully "customized" and monitored so that no-one<br>
is hurt worse than intended. A year in jail ain't too good for a 82 year<br>
old (or anyone else) either. Geriatric grandmothers are not exactly common<br>
violent offenders, and last but mot least, once agian, if you can't take the<br>
heat then *stay out of the kitchen*! No-one is forced to become a violent<br>
offender (and those who really can't control themselves should be removed<br>
from society anyway).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;First of all I think that revenge is a valid reason to punish too.       </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Why not?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't tell you why anymore than I can tell you why life is better than </i><br>
<i>&gt; death.        </i><br>
<p>
So there are no *rational* arguments against it, just emotional ones. O.k.<br>
This makes it a neutral matter of personal preference then, not something<br>
"inherently evil" like some people would like us to believe. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Example: a lion kills a member of a group of humans. Unlike dumb         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;herbivores (for example) they likely won't just accept the loss and      </i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;go on, but they'll want to punish that lion</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, if they're really intelligent they won't want to punish the lion, they'll </i><br>
<i>&gt; want to kill it. Time wasted in causing the lion more pain before they  kill </i><br>
<i>&gt; it could be better spent looking for food or dealing with other dangerous lions.</i><br>
<p>
Just killing the lion (and some others) will be enough to satisfy most people's<br>
urge for vengence. The point is that the feelings of resentment initiated the<br>
hunt, and (sometimes) the consequent extermination of a dangerous<br>
predator. Primitive man pesumably acted even more on impulse than we<br>
do, and feelings of hate and revenge might have helped him on his way to<br>
the top. If this is the case (and it seems likely), then there is at least *some*<br>
good in these emotions. Intelligence without passion (be it "good" or "bad")<br>
leads to nothing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;As a kind of compromise you could consider freezing executed         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;criminals as a standard practice. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not with my money! I'm amazed, I thought you were tough on crime.</i><br>
<p>
You are already paying your bit for all the people in jail whether you like<br>
it or not. Cryonic internment is hugely cheaper than keeping someone<br>
locked up, even without taking into account the drop in costs if large, <br>
automated, cost-efficient cryo prisons were built for mass storage.<br>
It's not only cheaper, but also much more humane. I may be "tough on<br>
(real) crime" like you say, but unlike most other people I *am* interested <br>
in real justice, which means that the legal system is balanced, consequent<br>
and doesn't cause someone more suffering than the law prescribes.<br>
<p>
In reality this means things like a fair, quick, discrete trial (no media<br>
circus) where only hard (forensic/video/audio etc.) evidence is <br>
admissible and everything is as automated as possible (electronic<br>
justice -- no juries and judges with very limited power), full legal <br>
assistance but only limited appeal possibilities, good food and comfortable <br>
cellspace while awaiting sentence, and if fould guilty of a capital <br>
offence (murder) a fully monitored execution according to the<br>
severity of the crime, followed by cryonic storage. No more, no less.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another </i><br>
<i>&gt; thing I was amazed at is when you included slander as a crime worthy of </i><br>
<i>&gt; punishment. In the first place I don't want the government or anybody else to </i><br>
<i>&gt; get into the truth determining business, </i><br>
<p>
In that case, you just don't want a government alltogether. That's fine with me,<br>
but we're discussing judicial systems for society here, not anarchy. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd rather do that myself, in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; second place, if you don't like the sound I make with my mouth then make some </i><br>
<i>&gt; sounds of your own to contradict them.</i><br>
<p>
Vicious slander can ruin someone's reputation for life, and can lead to loss of<br>
job(s), family problems, severe mental damage (sometimes suicide) due to<br>
rejection by the community/society etc. People don't really care about the<br>
truth, they want dirt, juicy details provided by tabloids etc. No amount of oral<br>
or other defense can fully reverse the effects of slander, the damage has been<br>
done. Therefore, anyone who willfully spreads damaging lies about another<br>
person deserves to be punished.<br>
               <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Full agreement here! Cameras and microphones all over as far as</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;I'm concerned (all public spaces like streets, parks, malls,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;tunnels etc.), all with interlocking fields of view. Some highly</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;visible, some hidden. Also cops should have small personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;cameras &amp; listening devices on their clothing and on their gun</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;(to be auto- activated whenever the  gun is drawn). Personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;cams etc. should be highly recommended to private citizens too.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The images are automatically send to various central databanks</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;with either completely free or highly monitored access, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;local copies (near the cam/audio device itself) are kept too</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;(and can be downloaded into the general databanks at designated</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;points (or via your PC or whatever). Everything is auto-dated</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;for later reference. Of course all certified recordings have</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;full power of evidence in a court of law. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That sounds a lot like Science Fiction writer David Brin's fist non fiction </i><br>
<i>&gt; book called "The  Transparent Society", I don't know it it's been published </i><br>
<i>&gt; yet. Brin advocates a world where nobody, not the President not the lowest </i><br>
<i>&gt; bum, could have any secrets. Cameras would be everywhere and be available to </i><br>
<i>&gt; all at any time, also, all files and records of any sort  would be open to</i><br>
<i>&gt; anybody who wanted to read them.</i><br>
/snip/<br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, as I told Mr. Brin, I personally find his idea repulsive but that's  </i><br>
<i>&gt; irrelevant because it's not going to happen. Brin's world is inherently  </i><br>
<i>&gt; unstable, </i><br>
<p>
So is our present world. I don't think a transparent society would be any<br>
more dangerous than one based on secrecy, but of course there's only<br>
one way to find out. Until that time, it would be very bold indeed to <br>
dismiss the idea alltogether. Anyway, I don't advocate _total_ transparency,<br>
just "perfect" monitoring of public areas, not homes, offices etc. (that's up<br>
to every individual) for increased safety "on the steets" and justice<br>
based on hard evidence, not flawed human witnesses. It seems that <br>
more and more people agee (the surveillance systems are<br>
popping up all over the world like crazy -- and are helping to take a<br>
bite out of crime), so as surveillance technology gets cheaper, smaller<br>
and better the "(semi-)transparent society" seems almost inevitable, <br>
whether we like it or not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If nobody in the world has secrets except me, that means I know all about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; marketing plans and product development of your company but you know nothing  </i><br>
<i>&gt; about mine, that gives my company an advantage, it will grow and so will the  </i><br>
<i>&gt; privacy meme. On the other hand, if I tell all and have no secrets but  </i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody else has secrets, then it is my company will be at a disadvantage </i><br>
<i>&gt; and shrink, and so will the transparency meme.  </i><br>
<p>
It's a classical "spears vs. shields" scenario: everybody will be spying, and at<br>
the same time trying to conceal their secrets. A Darwinian arena, hardly<br>
something new, and hardly the end of the world. And if you've had enough,<br>
well, there's the vast privacy of outer space.<br>
