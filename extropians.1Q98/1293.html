Eating human meat is a lot more dangerous to your health than eating <br>
(for example) cow meat because of all the possible diseases one might get<br>
from a fellow human. That's why cannibalism is bad. Also, eating other<br>
people might damage the sense of security in a society, certainly if<br>
practiced at random. The consumption of cow meat is a lot safer in health<br>
terms, and is considerably less (if at all) damaging to the sense of well-being<br>
within a contract group (society). Besides, well-prepared meat is D-LICIOUS! <br>
Mmmmmm! Yummy!<br>
<p>
P.s: I would never eat a cow I know personally ;-)<br>
