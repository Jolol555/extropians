Quite so.  I'm still not convinced it is exactly accurate to describe<br>
extropianism as a "movement" in the way you do.  At least not yet. <br>
Certainly there is something like an extropian community and a broad set<br>
of extropian ideas. The community is quite diverse, though, as are the<br>
ideas.  In the five years I've been hanging out here I've seen lots of<br>
strong personalities and strong agendas come and go, with the consequence<br>
that the tenor of the ongoing extropian conversation has taken some fairly<br>
extraordinary turns -- but the thing that has always remained consistent,<br>
and consistently arresting, is that the participants in the conversation<br>
always factor into their positions a sense of the possibilities, promises,<br>
and dangers of the technological future that I have never found elsewhere.<br>
These observations are also flavored by a gravitation toward a broadly<br>
libertarian, critical optimism of a kind espoused in Max More's<br>
principles, but rarely discussed in any detail or even really alluded to.<br>
It's a great place to spend time and learn in, but it doesn't feel focused<br>
enough to be properly described as a movement on its own terms.  Maybe<br>
it's more like a lifestyle looking to mature into a movement?<br>

<i>&gt; idealism for the sake of PR is exactly that--it is settling</i><br>
<i>&gt; for defeat before we have even tried sticking to principle.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A principled movement wants people to support its goals; if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; sacrifices those goals just to get people, what are those people</i><br>
<i>&gt; for?  Such a movement, where numbers of people are a goal in</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself, is no longer a principled movement, and is forever</i><br>
<i>&gt; doomed to success in its mediocrity.</i><br>
<p>
I actually agree with you.  But are you talking about extropianism here? <br>
There is a libertarian movement, a cryonics movement, a drug legalization<br>
movement, a feminist movement, a secular humanist movement, and a number<br>
of other movements which many/most individual extropians seem to have a<br>
stake in. But what is the goal of the extropian movement?  What is the<br>
victory our idealism will secure?  The future?  It's coming whatever we<br>
talk about here, and largely indifferent to what we talk about here.  What<br>
is the defeat we are presumably guarding against as a movement?  An<br>
unattractive future?  A future less free than we would like?  A future<br>
that opts out of the technological promises we hope for out of fear or<br>
fundamentalism?  A future that stamps out diversity in a quest for a<br>
singular vision of purity or propriety?  If so, well, *now* you're<br>
talking.  And of course the *reason* I keep talking about all this (I<br>
realized this after I penned a couple of posts about it, wondering vaguely<br>
all the while why I was getting so overheated about all this in the first<br>
place) is because the future extropianism talks about might just need a<br>
movement after all to articulate it, and even maybe the kind of passionate<br>
idealism you're talking about...  But the agenda, the goals, the ideals<br>
seem to me absolutely underspecified so far.  Best, Dale<br>
