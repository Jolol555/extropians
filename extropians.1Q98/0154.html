<i>&gt;AMG asked:</i><br>
<i>&gt;: Can we focus on greater involvement by increasing direct participation in</i><br>
government and eliminating the "them vs. us" syndrome that our so-called<br>
representative government is degenerating into?<br>
<p>
<p>
Anton Sherwood responded:<br>
<p>
<p>
Got news for ya: government is inherently adversarial - if it weren't, it<br>
wouldn't need force.  If you're serious about "eliminating the `them vs. us'<br>
syndrome", concentrate on voluntary action *outside* the domain where every<br>
action is a defeat for somebody.<br>
<p>
AMG questions:<br>
<p>
Is it possible that the force that government occasionally uses is due to<br>
the lack of participation by those effected by lack of fair and equitable<br>
representation? Is it possible that the system is so non-representative --<br>
and becoming increasingly so -- because of the constraints imposed on those<br>
selected to be our representatives by monied special interests?<br>
<p>
Is it possible that increased, and improved education with a stronger focus<br>
on scientific method, critical reasoning,emphasizing independent and<br>
skeptical thinking might result in a small first step towards eliminating<br>
the "them vs. us" syndrome? Is it possible that increased involvement by<br>
those many people who feel disenfranchised, frustrated and disgusted by the<br>
the present system might, through their activism, help the present system<br>
evolve?<br>
<p>
Are there other more realistic, practical and viable alternatives that can<br>
be effectively implimented over the short, intermediate and long term?<br>
