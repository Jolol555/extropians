I'm glad you noticed that. My view: A heresy.<br>
<p>
Harry Palmer (and btw, I love the fact that he didn't change his name)<br>
_was_ at one time fairly deeply involved with Scientology. I suspect Harry<br>
just needed a noun and picked one he knew.<br>
<p>
Based on my reading of Scientology and my experience of the Avatar<br>
materials, the Avatar rundowns, and other exercises, are _much_ more<br>
respectful of the individual. One size does not fit all. I could imagine a<br>
hostile investigator equating the two, but that person would have to have a<br>
serious axe to grind...<br>
<p>
Harry refers in one of his (two) books to his having had a problem with the<br>
upper (OT) levels of the Scientology stuff, where they expect(ed) you to<br>
relive the big cataclysm (I assume he's talking about Ximu/Xemu, "have you<br>
ever enslaved a planet", and all that)--<br>
--and Harry says he found himself wondering "is all this really necessary"? <br>
<p>
Of course, the answer is "no".<br>
<p>
The key nifty thing in Avatar is the notion and practice of "discreation",<br>
which is effortless and recovers attention you may not have noticed you<br>
were using. Since I happen to believe that attention is the only thing that<br>
is in fundamentally short supply for me, I took to it; and (after three<br>
separate attempts to get all the way through the material :) ) got to where<br>
I can do it fairly often.<br>
<p>
I think Harry &amp; Co. have gotten to where Ron thought he would get people<br>
to, giving Ron maximum benefit of the doubt (I have the semiheretical<br>
thought that when Ron wrote "Dianetics", he was acting in good faith,<br>
responding to genuine shortcomings in the psych-therapeutic methods of the<br>
time, and still had most of his screws fairly tight).<br>
<p>
I make no particular guarantees that Star's Edge has no shortcomings. But<br>
I've given serious thought to presenting the Avatar materials in a<br>
non-woo-woo, non-Newage way, to every gearhead, Dilbert and transhuman who<br>
is interested in reclaiming and focusing attention, and "creating what you<br>
prefer."<br>
<p>
My biggest open area (including doubt) regarding the Avatar materials lies<br>
right around the region of "persistent conditions" and "rundowns"--I may<br>
someday come to an answer to the same kind of question Harry found himself<br>
asking: "is all this really necessary"? But dat discreation stuff is da bomb.<br>
<p>
Details of my personal experiences available upon request.<br>
