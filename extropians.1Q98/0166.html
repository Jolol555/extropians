If any of you were watching the Discovery Channel program called "Shoot<br>
NOT to Kill" last night, you'd notice a device I had developed back in<br>
the late 80's is now being bandied about as a law enforcement tool. They<br>
discussed the use of short range contact and focussed beam EMP weapons<br>
to easily stop automobiles. I had built a device exactly like they<br>
discussed and demonstrated back in '89 and used it successfully against<br>
police trying to stop me for speeding. It shot a focussed EMP pulse in a<br>
cone behind my vehicle to a range of about 150 feet that would toast the<br>
engine control chips of a pursuing vehicle....<br>
<p>
Of course, no mention was made of the origin of this device, and the<br>
sort of application that ne'er-do-wells like myself could make of this<br>
technology....<br>
