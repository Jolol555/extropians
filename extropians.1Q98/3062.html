<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; better product and a better price, how is this a bad thing?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; If this is the case, why is dumping outlawed?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Oh, that one's easy to answer...because our legislators</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;are idiots, and will listen to the whining of someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;being undercut (and who makes a nice contribution).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;There is no legitimate reason to outlaw many business</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;practices that are now illegal: dumping, tying, insider</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;trading...it's just business.  But in a democracy--as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;opposed to a free society--the losers can use state</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;guns to make up for their incompetence in the market.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So if one company has more money than the others, it should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; allowed to charge less than cost for it's product? Doesn't this</i><br>
<i>&gt; leads to a situation where, in order to compete in the short run,</i><br>
<i>&gt; other companies are forced to do the same or lose customers?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wouldn't that just mean that the company with the most money to burn</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the start of this cycle will probably last longest? And after the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other competitors starve, the consumers are left with fewer choices</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the long run. And that sucks - monocultures are prone to atrophy</i><br>
<i>&gt; and catastrophic failure.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most "Americans" get all bent out of shape when businesses of</i><br>
<i>&gt; another state (like Japan) try this trick on "us". Why should we</i><br>
<i>&gt; allow it within our own market system?</i><br>
<p>
Because our government does not subsidize dumping. Japan and China do.<br>
End of story.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm not for excessive gubbamint regulation, but likewise, I wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; be in favor of any completely unregulated market scheme which didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; serve the ultimate interests of *individual humans* (ie consumers</i><br>
<i>&gt; and business people, not just the few richest businesses). I believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the goal of any market system should be to get the maximum</i><br>
<i>&gt; sustainable level of individual economic freedom and power for</i><br>
<i>&gt; *humans*, not corporations.</i><br>
<p>
Contrary to popular beleif, markets in which there are more than a few<br>
suppliers of products which can be marketed at commodity levels are<br>
easily non-regulated such that they produce the lowest possible cost to<br>
the consumer.<br>
<p>
Breaking up AT&amp;T was not deregulation, it was anti trust. The cable<br>
industry likewise is not deregulated, rather it is highly regulated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd love to have you describe a method for avoiding this type of</i><br>
<i>&gt; positive feedback trap without any type of regulatory intervention,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and change my mind.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I perfer the concepts of Vinge's _Conquest by Default_ in which Umpires<br>
rule on antitrust actions to prevent 'bigness', typically seen in<br>
organizations of more than 10,000 people. Pass this rule and no<br>
government larger than a small town would survive antitrust action.<br>
