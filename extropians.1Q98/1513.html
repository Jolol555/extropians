I've just read an article by Frederick Edwords which seems to adress the<br>
same problem, only with Humanism (I don't know much about Humanism but<br>
it seems very much to be Transhumanism or Extropianism without focussing<br>
on the future or the Extropian Principles, right?) The title was<br>
"Freethought challenges of the '90s", and it should be available<br>
somewhere on the web (I read it on my PalmPilot... ... I found it, see<br>
below ;-) )<br>
<p>
The most interesting idea in that article was to engage in all kinds of<br>
"social" work. You don't reach "the masses" with discussions about<br>
high-tech or even advanced psychology/philosophy because they don't even<br>
understand what you're talking about. Instead, *live* Dynamic Optimism<br>
and Spontanuous Order in a way that people can see - <br>
<p>
"The most Atheist and Humanist groups around the world do this. For<br>
example, during my travels in India I met with the people of the Atheist<br>
Center in Vijayawada who were active in counseling battered women,<br>
rehabilitating criminals, providing birth control services, helping<br>
people develop a rational life-style, even teaching 'atheistic' dances."<br>
(Frederick Edwords "Freethought challenges of the '90s" -<br>
<a href="http://humanist.net/humanism/freethot.html">http://humanist.net/humanism/freethot.html</a>)<br>
<p>
In that respect, I think the idea of "Extropian Gatherings" is quite a<br>
good one - provide that kind of service for anybody, but make it an<br>
"Extropian/Transhuman Service" ;-)<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, that sort of action needs a certain "critical mass" - a<br>
lot of supporters and a few people who are willing to spend a great<br>
amount their time... in that respect, I find working with like-minded<br>
organisations and individuals quite important.<br>
<p>
later,<br>
Holger<br>
