<p>
General relativity (GR) does forbid faster-than-light (FTL) travel through<br>
space-time.<br>
However, GR places no restriction on the speed at which space can inflate.<br>
Additionally,<br>
If you are 50 light years from point B and you set out at .99 the speed of<br>
light towards<br>
that point B, you will get there in less than 50 years due to the length<br>
contraction<br>
predicted by GR.  However to a (essentially) stationary observer on Earth 50<br>
years would<br>
pass between the time you set out for point B and the time you actually reached<br>
point B.<br>
<p>
Quantum tunneling would appear to violate the GR prediction that information<br>
can not travel<br>
at FTL speeds through space-time.  However, you can not determine the state of<br>
the new<br>
quantum state until you observe it.  Since you can not travel at FTL speeds you<br>
can not<br>
reach the object that experienced quantum tunneling and learn the information<br>
in a manner<br>
that would violate GR.<br>
<p>
The whole affair is nonintuitive and if you are confused thats a strong sign<br>
that you<br>
understand it! :)<br>
