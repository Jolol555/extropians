Something about technology, the state, and the crime rate in NYC... --Steve<br>

<i>&gt;New York Times Editorial, December 28, 1997</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Mapping Crime Hot Spots</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Making police commanders accountable for crime reduction may seem</i><br>
<i>&gt;common-sensical, but it is not routine in most police departments around</i><br>
<i>&gt;the country. The New York Police Department, which now operates under</i><br>
<i>&gt;this principle, offers proof to other cities that it can be effective.=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The strategy relies heavily on the use of computers to pinpoint hot</i><br>
<i>&gt;spots of crime so that precinct commanders can respond quickly to</i><br>
<i>&gt;squelch the outbreak. This approach is at least partially responsible</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the city's dramatic decline in crime rates. Jack Maple, a deputy</i><br>
<i>&gt;under former Police Commissioner William Bratton, developed the method</i><br>
<i>&gt;and has spread word of its impact to other urban centers with daunting</i><br>
<i>&gt;crime problems. In New Orleans and Newark, his tactics are getting</i><br>
<i>&gt;impressive results, in part because they force officers out onto the</i><br>
<i>&gt;streets. Birmingham, Ala., is another city looking at this approach.=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Easy-to-use computers and inexpensive software make it possible for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;police to create detailed daily maps showing when and where crime is</i><br>
<i>&gt;occurring. Precinct commanders and their superiors can then deploy more</i><br>
<i>&gt;officers to those areas. A rise in crime on a given street, which would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be hidden under aggregate statistics, is made plainly visible almost</i><br>
<i>&gt;instantly. This transparency makes it easier to hold commanders</i><br>
<i>&gt;accountable.=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In New Orleans, Mr. Maple's maps made clear that officers had to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;stationed at housing projects, where a huge proportion of the city's</i><br>
<i>&gt;crime was committed. Since making that change, violent crime in New</i><br>
<i>&gt;Orleans is down 22 percent from last year. Computer mapping is one</i><br>
<i>&gt;reason Newark, which recently hired Mr. Maple, has reduced its crime</i><br>
<i>&gt;rate by 13 percent from last year.=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hot-spot mapping is not the sole reason for safer streets in New York.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cracking down on low-level offenders, a shift in drug-trafficking</i><br>
<i>&gt;patterns and stricter sentencing also have helped. Some criminologists</i><br>
<i>&gt;fear that a high-accountability regime, marked by computer mapping, can</i><br>
<i>&gt;create pressures that demoralize a police force. Another potential</i><br>
<i>&gt;problem is that precinct supervisors may be tempted to underreport</i><br>
<i>&gt;crimes. Those are serious concerns that require strong management.=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;New York's record suggests that the hot-spot strategy can increase</i><br>
<i>&gt;police accountability for positive results. Experience elsewhere appears</i><br>
<i>&gt;to show that this approach can be successfully exported.=20</i><br>
