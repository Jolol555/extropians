I would like to see some sort of organism-wide testing device that could<br>
monitor people closely so that they could tailor their life extension programs<br>
to ongoing changes in their bodies.  Of course, there is much research to<br>
be done, but such a device could provide lots of data -- if enough users<br>
are willing to share it.<br>
<p>
I'm sure someone has come up with the idea before.  Has anyone heard<br>
of it?  And why has it not been built?<br>
<p>
As a practical aside, which specific dimensions would be most useful to<br>
measure?<br>
<p>

<p>
Good idea!  Getting people familiar with having/using such devices not<br>
only helps to spread our ideals but demystifies medicine and medical tech.<br>
