<p>
The government has little hope of effectively controlling technology.<br>
Advances in technology don't happen in the name of progress, but rather in<br>
the name of economics.  This alone nearly guarantees that technological<br>
progress will proceed, government willing or not.  Any progress that<br>
results tends to be a by-product of the economics of technology.<br>
<p>
Moving beyond this though, I have little faith that governments will create<br>
useful policy no matter how "responsible" it appears to the Joe Average.<br>
The problem is that politicians are generally as technologically inept as<br>
the populace, and tend to fall prey to the same ridiculous memes.  While<br>
technologists may not be able to fully control the technology and<br>
implications that they create, they are much better equipped to understand<br>
the ramifications and potential than the government.<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
You are assuming things that are clearly questionable in my mind.  First,<br>
government is simply not adaptive enough to qualify as a guiding force in a<br>
technology driven environment.  Government policy changes *much* slower<br>
than technology does.  Second, many humans *will* survive the onslaught of<br>
rapidly advancing technology.  I will grant that as the pace increases<br>
fewer people are able to make the grade as it were, but this is evolution<br>
in action.  Much of the population, while potentially capable, has not<br>
maintained their ability to adapt to these new technologies.<br>
<p>
The solution?  Prepare yourself the best you can and HANG ON!  Most<br>
importantly, people have to accept that change is a natural state of<br>
affairs.  The ability to control technological change is beyond the<br>
capability of individuals and governments.  However, it is through the<br>
actions of millions of free individuals that technology is guided.<br>
Therefore, the best and only way to "guide" technology is through the<br>
proper education of the populace.  Do this, and technology will take care<br>
of itself.<br>
