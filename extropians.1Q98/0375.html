"I respectfully disagree [snip].  No matter how much I may<br>
agree with your views, they are political.  You are trying to instill<br>
religious (even if Extropian) *values*.  Education should teach<br>
knowledge and skills that can be used by the individual.  Training an<br>
individual how they should behave in society is not education.  It is<br>
programming and brainwashing."<br>
<p>
<p>
Teaching children that cooperating with others can help all cooperating<br>
parties is not brainwashing.  It is practical education.  Such examples<br>
of this cooperation would include working in a business with other people<br>
and dividing chores in one's residence.  This view is not political, any<br>
more than a scientific fact is political; it's just the way the world is.<br>
 You will almost certainly be more successful in achieving your own goals<br>
if you cooperate with others than if you refuse to cooperate.  Teaching<br>
children that cooperation is usually beneficial is not teaching them how<br>
to behave in society; it is simply presenting them with the options they<br>
have and the likely consequences of choosing those options.  This is<br>
practical knowledge, which education should teach.  Being able to<br>
interact well with other humans requires many practical social skills,<br>
which education should also teach; those without these skills are<br>
severely handicapped, compared to those with good social skills.  Social<br>
skills are a crucial part of any good education.  Teaching them is not<br>
brainwashing; it is good, solid education in the world of action and<br>
consequence.  Society is a major part of the real world; children need to<br>
be taught good skills for using this network of humans to accomplish<br>
their own goals.<br>
