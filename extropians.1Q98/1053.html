The "vibe" seems pretty rational to me. One could propose that the<br>
primary purpose of any living entity is to increase extropy. By killing<br>
other conscious entities for material or other forms of gain, the net<br>
"extropic content" of the universe is decreased. Personally, I think it<br>
_is_ possible to make a tight link between personal ethics and<br>
"rational" thought.<br>
