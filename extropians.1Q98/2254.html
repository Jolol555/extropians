I think you are misrepresenting psychology here. Mainstream psychology<br>
has no accepted definition of the "mainstream" or "normality" people<br>
are supposed to conform to (many of the suggested definitions are very<br>
wide, and it should be remembered that Freud even denied the existence<br>
of normality), and most definitions of mental disorders have little to<br>
do with comparisions to a normal state and are instead defined from a<br>
classification of their symptoms (as revealed unto mankind in the holy<br>
DSM-IV :-). <br>
<p>
The important question is of course when a state should be regarded as<br>
a mental disorder or not. Modern psychology is aware of cultural<br>
differences here (just look into any modern clinical psychiatry book),<br>
but there are many states that are obviously undesirable even from the<br>
perspective of the patient. A more general definition would be to say<br>
that something is a mental disorder if it impairs a person's ability<br>
to live a normal life - this is where the "normal" appears - but in<br>
most cases this is a very basic "normal" like "able to interact with<br>
other people, able to distinguish reality from imagination, will not<br>
hurt himself". It can be abused, but usually it is fairly clear if<br>
somebody can function or not. Where to draw the lines is widely<br>
debated in psychiatry and psychology today, it is not a tacit<br>
agreement.<br>
<p>
As for this list, I haven't noticed much insanity here. Most<br>
extropians seem to be able to do reality-testing, so they are not<br>
delusional. The paranoia level seems fairly normal for the internet in<br>
the 90's. No obvious mood disorders as far as I can see, quite the<br>
opposite.<br>
