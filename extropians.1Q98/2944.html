                 Burning the Cosmic Commons: <br>
    Evolutionary Strategies for Interstellar Colonization<br>
<p>
                     by Robin Hanson<br>
<p>
Abstract:<br>
<p>
Consider an expanding wave of interstellar colonization, where <br>
"seeds" grow "colonies" at the "oases" surrounding stars, and <br>
then launch a new generation of seeds toward more distant oases.  <br>
Without enforceable property rights in virgin oases, frontier <br>
colonization behavior should eventually be given by a selection <br>
effect: only leading edge colonists whose strategies implemented <br>
the maximum sustainable average speed would tend to stay near <br>
the leading edge. <br>
 <br>
Even with such maximal strategies, however, random factors would <br>
cause some seeds to fall behind the leading edge.  Since <br>
eventually most of the colonized universe would be far behind<br>
the leading edge, the strategies and values of such fallen-behind <br>
colonists are of interest.<br>
<p>
We assume that oases are uniformly-distributed, that risk-neutral <br>
colonists with identical values and constant technology travel <br>
much farther than the oasis spacing, and that seeds receive noisy <br>
signals about which oases ahead are already occupied.  We then <br>
treat colonization as a game played out along a traveling wave of <br>
colonization, and consider how colonists choices change as they <br>
fall further behind.  <br>
<p>
At the very leading edge, great growth at oases is matched by <br>
great death between them, and an incredible premium is placed on <br>
seed hardness.  As congestion increases behind the leading edge, <br>
colonists stay longer at oases, grow more slowly there, launch and <br>
deliver more slower-traveling seeds, land at a wider range of <br>
oasis types, and spend more to see which oases are occupied.  <br>
<p>
There are limits, however, to how slow seeds fly, to how slow <br>
colonies grow, and to the fraction of good oases that get <br>
colonized.  And any colonists left behind after a seed launching <br>
try to leave as soon as possible.  Thus this model allows for lone <br>
oases like ours among large almost lifeless regions, though it <br>
also predicts large numbers of used-up oases and crashed seeds <br>
nearby.   <br>
