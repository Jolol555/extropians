If you, like me, enjoyed Lego as a child, you'll find this interesting<br>
(even more so if you have children). In fact, I'm tempted to go back to<br>
playing with Lego now...<br>

LONDON (January 27, 1998 12:49 p.m. EST <a href="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</a>) - Toy maker<br>
Lego unveiled on Tuesday the world's first thinking child's building<br>
brick.<br>
<p>
<p>
The Danish company launched an intelligent brick equipped with a<br>
micro-computer that will enable children to design, build and program<br>
their own robots.<br>
<p>
<p>
The manufacturer of interlocking plastic building bricks used by children<br>
all over the world unveiled products it dubbed "a new generation of<br>
intelligent construction toys and learning tools for children" and<br>
incorporating computer technology.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Now we are able to put the Lego universe into the computer and the<br>
computer into the Lego brick," said Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, the<br>
third-generation owner and president of the international group, at the<br>
official launch in London.<br>
<p>
<p>
The basic construction brick was created in 1949 and the addition of<br>
wheels, gears and motors in the 1960s enabled children to build machines<br>
that move.<br>
<p>
<p>
This third level of innovation allows the new generation of<br>
computer-literate children to give their creations a personality.<br>
<p>
<p>
A personal computer is used to program the Lego invention using the<br>
intelligent brick which controls the model's motors. Sensors allow the<br>
model to react and respond to its environment independently of the<br>
child.<br>
<p>
<p>
"When children combine the three levels, there is basically no limit to<br>
what they can create," Kristiansen said.<br>
<p>
<p>
Gordon Carpenter, Managing Director of Lego UK Ltd, said<br>
computer-literate children aged 10 and older would be able to grasp the<br>
basics of the system in under an hour and would soon be dealing with<br>
concepts previously taught only at university.<br>
<p>
<p>
"It adds even more to our concepts of aiding imagination, creativity and<br>
development in children," he said.<br>
<p>
<p>
The privately-owned Lego company has been working on the project for over<br>
a decade with Dr Seymour Papert, Professor of Learning Research at the<br>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br>
<p>
<p>
"When you give children this kind of material, very often they perform at<br>
an intellectual level that astonishes their teachers and themselves," he<br>
said.<br>
<p>
<p>
Children testing the new product have built and programmed musical<br>
instruments which play tunes when light sensors read different colours<br>
and a robotic arm that could pick up a soft-drink can.<br>
<p>
<p>
A nine-year-old girl built a bird feeder digitally linked to a camera<br>
which took pictures of every bird that landed on the feeder platform.<br>
<p>
<p>
Lego has also created a computer game to complement the intelligent brick<br>
used in the models, providing a futuristic fantasy environment called<br>
Lego Technic City of Tomorrow which sets the scene for models that 'come<br>
alive' on the floor.<br>
