I think this is a good idea.<br>

I watched a program on TLC last summer about Cryptography.  Romana<br>
Machado appeared on this program.  I was struck by the level of<br>
confidence she conveyed.  Enough so that I did a search to see if she<br>
had a web page.  From her page I found my way to the Transhuman and<br>
Extropian pages.  Had it not been for Romana's appearance on that<br>
program I would not be aware of Transhumanism or Extropians.<br>
