I have been noticing this very phenomena for well over a year now, and<br>
even wrote about this very issue in a rebuttal article about their now<br>
infamous<br>
nanotechnology piece, which I subsequently published in the November 1996<br>
(Vol. 7, No. 4) issue of Midnight Engineering.<br>
<p>
Scientific American was actually purchased by a German publishing consortia,<br>
one of the senior corporate officers of which I met recently at a trade show /<br>
conference.  My sense is that, after some bit of conversation with this<br>
gentleman,<br>
they were hoping to gain new marketshare by converting S.A. into more of<br>
a "popular science" kind of publication, injecting more tabloid style "fringe<br>
science"<br>
types of articles, etc.<br>
<p>
What they have really done is alienate their traditional reading audience, who<br>
at one time (including myself) held S.A. in the same esteem as peer reviewed<br>
scientific journals such as Nature, or Science.  Now, however, they have<br>
thouroughly<br>
alienated their core constituency, while not gaining the market demographic<br>
they were theoretically targeting.   <br>
<p>
How very sad indeed.    I think these foreign publishing investors just didn't<br>
"get it" then, and still don't.  S.A. is now a shell of its former self,<br>
floundering,<br>
searching for a new identity.<br>
<p>
Such is the fickle nature of the publishing business . . . I should know, as<br>
this is<br>
a world with which I am all too familiar<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;It's a small world, exactly the same was true for me, I  have every issue of </i><br>
<i>&gt;Scientific American from 1966 to today. I still read it but It's only a pale </i><br>

<i>&gt;dumb it down just about the time the magazine was sold to the same company </i><br>
<i>&gt;that publishes Nature. Go figure.</i><br>
