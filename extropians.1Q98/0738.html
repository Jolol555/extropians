Human Cell Lifespan Extended<br>
<p>
NEW YORK (Reuters) -- For the first time, researchers have confirmed that the<br>
"clock" thought to control aging in human cells does indeed dictate that<br>
process. What's more, they have found a way to circumvent the process --<br>
extending the lifespan of normal, healthy human cells, according to a report<br>
in Science.<br>
<p>
The finding has "profound" implications for the study of cancer, which may<br>
use the same process to escape the aging process, according to an editorial<br>
accompanying the study.<br>
<p>
And it may lead to treatment for human disease caused by worn out cells, such<br>
as macular degeneration -- the leading cause of blindness in those over 65.<br>
<p>
"This research raises the possibility that we could take a patient's own<br>
cells, rejuvenate them, then modify the cells as needed and give them back to<br>
the patient to treat a variety of genetic and other diseases," said senior<br>
investigator Dr. Woodring E. Wright in a statement released by the University<br>
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. "The potential long-term<br>
applications are simply staggering," said Wright, a professor of cell biology<br>
and neuroscience. The study was a collaborative effort involving researchers<br>
at the medical center and at Geron Corp., in Menlo Park, California.<br>
<p>
Most cells will divide roughly 50 times in the laboratory before entering a<br>
resting state known as senescence, a process that also occurs in the body.<br>
For more than a decade, researchers have suspected that telomeres, sections of<br>
DNA at the tips of chromosomes, control that process.<br>
<p>
Like minutes ticking on a clock, a piece of telomere is lost each time the<br>
cell divides. But some cells contain an enzyme, called telomerase, that can<br>
re-build the telomere after cell division.<br>
<p>
In the new study, the gene for telomerase was inserted inside three types of<br>
cells that don't normally carry the enzyme -- retinal pigment epithelial<br>
cells, foreskin fibroblasts, and the vascular endothelial cells -- or those<br>
lining blood vessels. In contrast with cultured cells that have telomere<br>
shortening, the genetically engineered cells continued to vigorously divide<br>
and have long telomeres.<br>
<p>
The treated cell population doubled at least 20 more times than normal and<br>
continues to grow, according to the report. The new findings confirm that<br>
telomeres are the "clock" that keeps cells from growing out of control,<br>
according to an editorial by Titia de Lange, of the Laboratory for Cell<br>
Biology and Genetics at The Rockefeller University in New York. And that<br>
mechanism has all "the makings of a powerful tumor suppressor system," de<br>
Lange wrote.<br>
<p>
"The results should strengthen the determination of those who are searching<br>
for telomerase inhibitors as potential anti-cancer agents." SOURCE: Science<br>
