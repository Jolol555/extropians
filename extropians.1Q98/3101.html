<i>&gt; 	&gt;If one would be accused of a crime, he could hire as many people to </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;*prove his innocence* as he pleased/could afford. </i><br>
<i>&gt; 			    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Prove  his innocence? In the USA about 40,000 murders are committed each year,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; with a liberal interpretation of the word "prove" I might be able to prove I  </i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't commit 75% of them, unfortunately that leaves 10,000 murders I'm </i><br>
<i>&gt; unable to prove I didn't commit.</i><br>
<p>
Proving your innocence is done by, for example, demonstrating that you weren't<br>
at the scene of the crime at the time of the murder (or whatever). Only one<br>
(or a couple in extreme cases) of all those thousands of murders is relevant<br>
to the case -- the one that has somehow been linked to you. The rest has<br>
nothing to do with your case, so you don't have to prove anything. <br>
 		   <br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;Human judges would still have a place in this system as controllers </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;of the computers' verdict (other controllers are the defendant and </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;his defense team or designated others) which is a simple summing up </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;of the known facts with a recommendation (xx% chance that guilty of </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;crime xx resulting in punishment no. xx). </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Just add up the facts and crank out a conclusion, It's a real shame that </i><br>
<i>&gt; wisdom can't be achieved that easily, we would have had super intelligent </i><br>
<i>&gt; computers long ago, although they'd be too busy changing the universe to </i><br>
<i>&gt; concern themselves with human beings and their petty disputes.</i><br>
<p>
AI has nothing to do with it, these justice computers could be just a couple<br>
of simple PCs. Justice *should* be a matter of "adding up the facts", not<br>
"the whim of the day" of some judge. In a fair justice system one can<br>
count on an equal treatment of all cases. The best way to do this is to<br>
minimize the power of the human judges so that they truly speak on<br>
behalf of the _law_, and not themselves. The central justice computer<br>
simply presents all the facts of a particular case in a comprehensive<br>
matter. If the points of the prosecution haven't been refuted, then the<br>
conclusion is simple: guilty. It's basically the same system we use<br>
today, only streamlined and with curbed human judges to prevent <br>
arbitrary sentencing "because he didn't like his face or whatever".<br>
Juries are elliminated alltogether for the same reason. It's the _facts_<br>
that count, not people's whimsical opinions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;there are lie detectors that, although still not too reliable, have </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;an intimidating effect on all but the toughest suspects </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes they are intimidating, to the innocent as well as the guilty. I would  </i><br>
<i>&gt; agree to have a lie detector test only if I was guilty and about to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; convicted.  I've read a little about them and I think I'd have a better than </i><br>
<i>&gt; 50% chance of beating the machine, unless of course the operator didn't like </i><br>
<i>&gt; me, interpretation the machine's output is largely subjective.</i><br>
<p>
The lie detector would only be used as a tool to add some pressure to the<br>
questioning, and could only serve as supporting evidence, not primary evidence<br>
that can lead to a conviction. It works because only the guilty know the<br>
details of the crime in question (it is not allowed to give details to the media),<br>
and only a guilty person would be nervous if the police brought him in for<br>
questioning (because, believe it or not, this would be a pretty fair judicial<br>
system, with *very* little chance of false convictions due to the many<br>
safeties (monitoring of all legal personel and facilities - tough punishments for <br>
"bad cops" etc.) and hard evidence-based convictions (when in doubt - don't <br>
convict). If you can beat the lie detector that doesn't mean you can go home,<br>
although it can be used as minor supporting evidence to your innocence.<br>
 	     <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;hard questioning. This means causing physical/mental nonlethal/not </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;permanently damaging discomfort the suspect in order to extract a </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;detailed confession (no words shall be put in the suspect's mouth, </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;and a confession alone can't convict; details only known to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;murderer/thief etc. must be forthcoming). </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	     </i><br>
<i>&gt; You say you didn't murder anybody but I suspect you may have, so like a good  </i><br>
<i>&gt; policeman I bring you in for some hard questioning. After I pull your third </i><br>
<i>&gt; fingernail off by the roots </i><br>
<p>
This is a *very* cheap shot, obviously your prejudice has prevented you from<br>
thoroughly reading the text above: "This means causing physical/mental <br>
NONlethal/NOT PERMANENTLY DAMAGING discomfort the suspect in order <br>
to extract a confession". No (permanent) physical damage. So where did those <br>
pliers come from? The cop who did that would be immediately removed from his job<br>
and be paying damages to the victim.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; After I pull off all ten of </i><br>
<i>&gt; your fingernails your claims of being a killer of the vilest sort are even </i><br>
<i>&gt; more vigorous, but despite my insistence that you do so you still tell me no </i><br>
<i>&gt; details of the crime not generally known.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What should a reasonable policeman such as myself do at this point?</i><br>
 <br>
[substitute pulling fingernails for something else, like dripping water on<br>
forehead -- doesn't leave a mark and is extremely effective. Tickling the<br>
soles of the feet, funny as it may sound, apparently works pretty well too.]<br>
<p>
If after a predetermined amount of time (the docters must see to it that the<br>
questioning isn't overdone) no details are forthcoming the prisoner might<br>
either be set free (and secretly monitored in case he incriminates himself<br>
by re-burying bodies or bragging to friends etc.) or remain in custody for<br>
later questioning. This depends on his physical/mental fitness, seriousness<br>
of the crime etc. There is a clear limit to this process (say a week or two).<br>
If there still are no results the suspect is released (and monitored) while<br>
the police re-evaluate the case.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;crime rates would be down considerably due to decriminalization of </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;victimless crimes like drug abuse, gambling, prostitution etc. so </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;that the police and justice system could focus all their manpower on </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;the real crimes </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your technique would be particularly effective against real crimes like </i><br>
<i>&gt; slander, I'll bet close to 100% would retract their statement and apologize </i><br>
<i>&gt; to the state for any embarrassment caused.   </i><br>
<p>
I've made my case against slander earlier, so it should suffice to say that<br>
the slanderer should _prove beyond reasonable doubt_ in a court of law<br>
that the accusations (slander) are true, and not meant to damage another's<br>
reputation for personal gain or out of pure malice. Is this so unreasonable????<br>
Words _can_ hurt people directly, and by leading to actions that hurt them<br>
both mentally and phisically. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;society as a whole would have to be re-educated (through the  usual </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;channels like CNN, tabloids, soaps &amp; movies) to condemn only really </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;damaging behaviour instead of harmless recreation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's amazing how easy it reach a consensus and educate reporters and authors,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; all you need is a sturdy pair of pliers.</i><br>
<p>
A sturdy fine will do the trick too, methinks...<br>
