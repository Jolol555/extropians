Interesting point of view.<br>
<p>
I would say that the reflection of human nature in life, tends to give<br>
people a sense of meaning, which according to Segan's film Contact, science<br>
has failed to provide.<br>
<p>
I think humans, particularly scientists, seem to think that they can<br>
control nature itself. This dangerous perspective is responsible for the<br>
misuse of advancements in science which have led to one of the worst eras<br>
of earths history, in terms of pollution.<br>
<p>
ahh who knows what I'm trying to say..<br>
<p>
where's my coffee.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The discovery of penicillin has done more to increase the sum total of</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; is fundamentally a form of entertainment, something to occupy the mind.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But the real changes in the world, the ones which will totally reshape</i><br>
<i>&gt; human society over the next century, come from science and technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; All the transhumanist art in the world is not going to turn us into</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumans.  Only technology can do that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not saying I share this attitude, but I think it is good to express</i><br>
<i>&gt; it in bold and even offensive terms just to get it out in the open and</i><br>
<i>&gt; let people respond.</i><br>
