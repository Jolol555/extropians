<i>&gt;&gt; IAN: A definition is useful IF it puts </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the defined in context, IF it defines </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the relations of the defined to things </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that are different than it. The "A=A" </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; definition of A does not do that...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have an even stronger standard: that the identity</i><br>
<i>&gt;of an can be expressed as the relationship between</i><br>
<i>&gt;X and not-X is a truism that a 12-year-old could</i><br>
<i>&gt;understand with a bit of reflection, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: And yet many people over twice<br>
  that age seem not to understand it<br>
  even after a lot of reflection.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;and it is "true"</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the metaphysical sense that it is impossible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;show a counterexample, but it is /not useful/ to</i><br>
<i>&gt;anyone, because It doesn't help me predict things.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: How do you know that it does not?<br>
  Holism does help us to predict things. <br>
  Half the "bizarre" phenomena occurring <br>
  in quantum physics would not be so un-<br>
  predictable IF holism had been a more<br>
  understood philosophical paradigm.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The symbolic string manipulations of traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt;boolean algebra, starting with "A=A", are useful to</i><br>
<i>&gt;prove complex theorems; /they don't mean anything/,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and never have, so your rant against them is hollow.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: I think not, the fact that there<br>
  is so much belief/resistance to the <br>
  idea that the identity of A is derived<br>
  from the A/~A relation, not A alone<br>
  (which you seem to agree with), is<br>
  the measure of the fact that to argue<br>
  against the contrary is not hollow.<br>
  It seems to mean that people have <br>
  mistaken the A=A symbology for truth.<br>
<p>
  I think it's inherently not hollow <br>
  to argue against a popular fallacy.<br>
<p>
<p>
[sniped]<br>
<i>&gt;Don't tell me that holism is /true/. I don't give a</i><br>
<i>&gt;damn. Tell me how I can /profit/ from it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: I hear what your saying and I think <br>
  you've articulated it well, however, before<br>
  we can get to profits from logical analysis <br>
  we have to get to truths. I think that the<br>
  goal of inquiry is to arrive at truths, how<br>
  ever unprofitable they may seem by them-<br>
  selves. If I find that popular belief holds <br>
  to an idea about truth that, as you said, a <br>
  twelve-year-old child can see through, then <br>
  that belief should and must be challenged. <br>
<p>
  I believe that if profit is held as the <br>
  ideal of wether X is "useful" or "good,"<br>
  we're really selling ourself short. There's<br>
  much more to life than profits. I guess you <br>
  see profit as a prime directive, while I see<br>
  "to know the truth" as a prime directive.<br>
  I think that the two can be harmonious.<br>
