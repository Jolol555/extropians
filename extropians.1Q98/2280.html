I would disagree. Gently, of course. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So, to answer the age-old question (in my best way possible), I would say</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the objective of science is to create or discover new ways to increase</i><br>
<i>&gt;convenience and progress for society as a whole...</i><br>
<p>
Nope, that's problem-solving. Engineering. Technology. Medicine. Etc. <br>
<p>
Good stuff, great stuff, and it needs science as an input or it's just<br>
doing it the way your grandparents did it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;as well as create or</i><br>
<i>&gt;discover answers to all the "how's" and "why's" society encounters during</i><br>
<i>&gt;its progression.  </i><br>
<p>
That's closer to being what science is about. But there is no such thing as<br>
"applied science". :) Or rather, if you apply science or math to a<br>
practical problem, then you are doing "techne", *not* "scientia".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The objective of art is somewhat more individual</i><br>
<i>&gt;oriented, though I think it is safe to say that an artist's objective is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;convey his or her knowledge and ideas to society in the best (and often</i><br>
<i>&gt;only) way possible.  </i><br>
<p>
E. Shaun, methinks you are playing into the had of those who declare art<br>
only to be that stuff on the wall with a frame around it. :\ :) I think art<br>
is any directed human activity which achieves a quality richer than the sum<br>
of its parts: joy outweighing (circuit-2 and below) pleasure. That does<br>
tend to seem subjective, yet there is a lot of overlap across cultures, in<br>
my slight experience. Some art crosses cultures easier than others; I have<br>
more to say about this but the margins of this email are to small to<br>
contain it. :)<br>
<p>
I think that art doesn't have to be just about ideas. I think a good<br>
session of go is art. I think a good session of bodysurfing could be<br>
considered solitary performance/lively art. I think singing in the shower<br>
is art. I think a hilarious session of clowning around with my 10-year-old<br>
niece is art. Where are the ideas? Are they all sleeping furiously in the<br>
bin labeled "Colorless Green"? :)<br>
<p>
Peace,<br>
<p>
MMB<br>
