<i>&gt; ----------</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; From: Yak Wax &lt;yakwax@yahoo.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A few people on this list, myself included, have commented on taking</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; illegal research underground and possibly attempting to control</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; political movements that may counter progress.  And while it may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; futile to even try this, it has a certain undeniable appeal.  Besides,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; why do we all seem so intent on obeying the law?  Nobody's holding a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; gun to your head!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It has probably something to do with waxing fat under the current regime</i><br>
<i>&gt; and such. People with good jobs (and especially scientists) make lousy</i><br>
<i>&gt; revolutionaries.</i><br>
<p>
True, but their kids are great, especially when hard ass dad cuts junior off from his<br>
credit cards....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; So, how about some people share their wisdom as to why it wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; work, what such an organisation should do if it could work, and how to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; go about implementing it.  I have some ideas of my own, but for now</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'm going to keep them shadowy and elusive...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In theory transhumanists could make a great underground organization;</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardly any group packs more raw mental power than this one. Fortunately</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the powers that be organizing and getting revolutionary aren't exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; our strongest points, maybe by definition. Still, I like the idea of a "shadow</i><br>
<i>&gt; ExI". Not only is this simply fun and a way to gain some extra material wealth,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but ultimately it might be the only way to survive the future. Unfortunately this</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea is about as viable as an aborted fetus...</i><br>
<p>
Especially since this list, due partly to its irreverent politics/point of view, its<br>
regard for personal experimentation with controlled substances, as well as the<br>
previously cited high average IQ, is almost assuredly under constant subscription by<br>
some no good rat in the Federal bureaucracy. I'd expect a good 1/4 of all list<br>
subscribers are intelligence agency related accounts. The first rule of<br>
counterintelligence is to penetrate and take over the opposition groups, and make<br>
them do what you want them to do to achive your ends.<br>
