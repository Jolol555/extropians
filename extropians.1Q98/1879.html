I'm sorry, but I have to laugh when I hear the "none of your business"<br>
or "wait until he is proven guilty of a crime" stuff trotted out to<br>
defend Clinton.<br>
<p>
Maybe if he and his wife (and all the other politicians) left me alone,<br>
I'd reciprocate.  But here's a guy who thinks nothing of backing drug<br>
forfeiture laws which seize an individual's property without even<br>
charging the person with a crime!<br>
<p>
Who has his drug czar threaten doctors who might prescribe marijuanna to<br>
their patients, even after the general public agrees in vote that they<br>
want more health freedom.<br>
<p>
I'd love for Bill and Hillary to get to say "None of your business" when<br>
it comes to their personal life, but dang it they keep bringing 'round a<br>
village to run my life...from raising my kids to nationalizing my health<br>
care.<br>
<p>
Here's a pair who've proposed to punish us if we attempt to get better<br>
or even different medical care than our neighbors, (e.g., by spending<br>
your own money for a covered operation), both you and your doctor will<br>
be committing a federal crime.<br>
<p>
Who favor Federal health-care police authorized to enter your home<br>
without search warrants for "indoor air-quality inspections" and "well<br>
baby" visits. If they decide you have an "unhealthy" home<br>
environment, existing child-abuse laws authorize them to immediately<br>
take away your children.<br>
<p>
Their "Comprehensive School Health Education" initiatives authorize the<br>
government to shape<br>
your children's behavior involving "Tobacco use; alcohol and other drug<br>
abuse; sexual behaviors ... ;<br>
behaviors resulting in intentional and unintentional injuries; dietary<br>
patterns resulting in disease; and<br>
sedentary life styles . . ." [HSA, pp. 607-608]<br>
<p>
Under Clinton's plan, your doctor would be forced to turn over all of<br>
your medical information to a<br>
federal computer center. Your children would be registered with the<br>
state from birth. If your doctor<br>
withholds any information, he can be fined $10,000 per violation,<br>
without trial. [HSA, p. 871]<br>
<p>
And Bill want us all to carry to carry a government-issued Health<br>
Security Card which could hold up to 1,600 pages of information about<br>
you.<br>
<p>
Your mandatory ID card and government health files will make nearly<br>
every detail of your life an<br>
open book to millions of bureaucrats, IRS agents, and police officers.<br>
Once they run your card<br>
through a scanner, they'll know everything you've ever written on a<br>
medical form or told your doctor:<br>
your address, phone number, employer, drug history, every physical and<br>
mental disorder,<br>
pregnancies and abortions -- and even you doctor's personal notes.<br>
<p>
Clinton's plan creates 105 new government agencies, and greatly expands<br>
the power of 42 others. Hundreds of thousands of bureaucrats will<br>
monitor you and your doctor, reeducate your children, and enter your<br>
office and home at will.<br>
<p>
Yeah, poor Bill Clinton, let's stay out of his private life.<br>
<p>
                                                                Pat<br>
