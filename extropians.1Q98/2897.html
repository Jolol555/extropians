Ian Goddard wrote 3/13/98: &lt;Energy is holistic....  Identity is<br>
holistic....  I'm working away attempting to perfect the description of the<br>
holism of identity and the identity (defined as "same as") between holistic<br>
identity and everything: energy, force, velocity, gravity, space-time,<br>
electromagnetic charge...&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't think velocity belongs to this list of related concepts.  If you<br>
leave off time from 'space-time' and put aside 'electromagnetic charge' and<br>
'gravity' as subconcepts of energy-force-space then you can accomplish<br>
this.  What you will have accomplished was accomplished by Parmenides many<br>
moons ago, when he posited the One.  Your axiom is simply 'the One'.  Now<br>
you need to proceed to Democritus and incorporate 'the Many' with 'the<br>
One'.  Things do have a beginning and an end, there are indivisible things,<br>
these are related to 'the Many' to matter or bits of substance, to discrete<br>
time.<br>
<p>
&lt;...just as net universal energy equals zero.&gt;<br>
<p>
Or should that be net universal energy equals One?<br>
<p>
&lt;...you cannot get something from nothing...&gt;<br>
<p>
Tell that to the Big Bang crackpots.  You cannot get energy from itself,<br>
nor can you get identity from itself, nor can you get an axiom from itself.<br>
 More is involved than holism.<br>

interesting than "everything=everything".&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes, please do.<br>
