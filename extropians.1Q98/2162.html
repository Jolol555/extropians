I find the opinion that SciAm is "one of the best popular scientific <br>
journals" rather sad -- and even sadder is that it's probably true.  <br>
The problem is that I have had a very low opinion of SciAm for quite <br>
a few years, shortly after I noticed that on *any* controversial <br>
issue the scientific articles published in this magazine would weigh <br>
*heavily* toward that side which could be most accurately summarized <br>
as "give the government greater control of the economy".<br>
<p>
On issues where that isn't relevant -- for example, the debate over <br>
the relationship between dinosaurs and birds -- SciAm has seemed <br>
pretty good.<br>
<p>
But IIRC this magazine was about the first "scientific" publication <br>
to inform us that there is a solid consensus among relevant experts <br>
that human-caused global warming is a problem and we must do <br>
something about it.  At that time, judging by articles and letters in <br>
peer-reviewed scientific publications, the apparent vote among the <br>
relevant experts was 25% against, 15% for, and 60% insufficient <br>
information.<br>
