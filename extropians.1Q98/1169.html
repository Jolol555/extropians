<i>&gt; Hey Charlie,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps we should all realize that capitalism will soon become an</i><br>
<i>&gt; absurdity and cease to exist.</i><br>
<p>
The fundamental capital is human capital; therefore the alternative<br>
- -- the ONLY alternative -- to capitalism, is slavery.  I for one will<br>
be quite upset if capitalism ceases to exist.<br>
<p>

<p>
What you fail to see is that BOTH capitalism  AND communism, are ways<br>
of  FORCING humans to produce and buy goods and services, OR STARVE TO<br>
DEATH.<br>
<p>
Therefore,  it is not logical to say that the ONLY  ALTERNATIVE to<br>
capitalism is slavery for humans.<br>
<p>
In a Robotopia, only the robots,  which may soon provide humans a bounty<br>
of whatever we desire absolutely free,  could be considered slaves.<br>
<p>
This raises another question:  If the robots are smart enough to supply<br>
all the goods and services  humans could demand, why would they?<br>
<p>
I have spent the last thirty years as an accountant in private practice<br>
advising clients on how to cut costs and optimize production.  I have <br>
discussed this notion at length in my Robotopia article.<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.cyberlewis.com/graphic/posthuman/topia/Robotopia.htm">http://www.cyberlewis.com/graphic/posthuman/topia/Robotopia.htm</a><br>
<p>
I, too, will miss capitalism if it is replaced by Robotopia.<br>
<p>
I have had fun rough housing in boardrooms and bankers' parties.   From<br>
an early age, capitalism has been in my blood.<br>
<p>
I am also a realist.  After thirty years in accounting, watching some<br>
business prosper while others collapsed into insolvancy, I can see where<br>
my advice and that of other accountants is leading.    But I can't stop<br>
the flow toward better, more efficient technologies.   Business,<br>
listening to their accountants, will continue competing, continue<br>
cutting costs, continue to upgrade equipment, until the last cent of<br>
cost is sqeezed to zero and machines are doing all the work without<br>
human assistance.    Any business which refuses to cut cost, will be put<br>
out of business that much sooner by those which do.<br>
<p>
Look at transitors:<br>
<p>
Bardeen, Shockley and Brattain invented the transitor in Bell Labs in<br>
1948.  Bell Labs offered to license  the chip technology for $25,000<br>
against future royalties.  Sony was the only taker.<br>
<p>
Those first transitors sold for $45 each.  Today, transitors sell at<br>
.00001cent each when combined by the millions in computer chips that are<br>
smaller than the original transitor.   In accordance with Moore's law,  <br>
these trends continue today actually accellerating  with each new<br>
generation of chip design.   The power of a computer costing millions in<br>
1960 can now be bought for under a thousand dollars.<br>
<p>
Next, look at what is happening in the browser wars.<br>
<p>
Microsoft has been  giving away its browser, Internet Explorer (often<br>
bundled, of course).<br>
<p>
Netscape then sees its market share dwindle from 90% to 80% to 70% etc.<br>
<p>
Last week, Netscape anounced it will also give away its browser, plus<br>
make the source code for Version 5 available free to world on its web<br>
site.<br>
<p>
Good old capitalist  competition is at work again, driving costs for<br>
browser users to zero. . .absolutely FREE. . .<br>
<p>
Look at the web itself.  From the users point of view, there are<br>
tremendous amounts of goods and services that are already absolutely<br>
free.<br>
<p>
Look around the fast changing, high tech world we all share.  It is not <br>
much of a stretch  to say:<br>
<p>
" Perhaps we should all realize that capitalism will soon become an<br>
absurdity and cease to exist. . ."<br>
 <br>
<p>
Please take a second look at my  Robotopia article.<br>
