Tolerated is a good word, but the reason it is tolerated is that<br>
the vast majority of people feel that this is an issue that can<br>
only be decided by the individual, that the federal, state, or even<br>
local governments have no rights in this matter.<br>

Really Reilly, I have an answer for you, support contraception use<br>
and education, every pregnancy you help prevent will eliminate the<br>
possibility of an abortion, if the "right to life" movement had<br>
taken this position years ago millions of abortions could have been<br>
prevented.<br>
<p>
Want another? develop a program so that pregnant teens would have<br>
a place to live and could develop job skills so they could keep and<br>
raise their babies. Make this a genuine effort, not like the Rev<br>
Falwell's "Baby Ranch".<br>
<p>
Note: the Rev Falwell used to have a place (don't know if it's<br>
still open) where unwed pregnant teens could stay untill their<br>
babies were born, they were then (the babies) put up for adoption.<br>
<p>
Monstrous....<br>
<p>
I'll make a prediction, you'll do neither, the many pro-lifers I've<br>
met (ever hear of a man by the name of Schneider?) were never<br>
interested in preventing pregnancy, just interested in preventing<br>
unwanted (not in their eyes) pregnancies from ending. Why? See the<br>
above paragraph.<br>
