I can't find the source of the Stroustrup interview parody<br>
anywhere, so I don't know whom to credit for it, but it is<br>
definitely not Stroustrup.  There are several real interviews<br>
with him on the net, and a whole book by him on the subject,<br>
none of which have this parody's choppy, idiomatic writing<br>
style, or anything like its contents.<br>
<p>
My personal opinion, as a programmer, on the impact of<br>
language choice on engineering success is this: Yes, the<br>
choice of language impacts what solutions are thought of<br>
and chosen, in addition to the obvio8us effects on the<br>
efficacy of the solution and ease of development.  I do<br>
not think it is a primary determinant of success, though:<br>
talented engineers will manage to find good solutions in<br>
whatever medium of expression is at hand.<br>
<p>
There's a great story in Douglas Hofstaedter's book<br>
_Le Ton Beau de Marot_ about his trip to Poland.  He is<br>
having a conversation in a coffee shop, struggling to<br>
remember the grammar, periodically checking his Polish<br>
phrasebook, but managing.  Soon he is joined by someone<br>
speaking German, and discovers that the person he was<br>
talking to also speaks German, so he switches.  This<br>
being his third language, he is still not entirely<br>
comfortable, but much moreso than in Polish, which he<br>
has only studied for the trip.  Later still, he speaks<br>
to another friend in French, his second and almost-<br>
native language which he is quite comfortable with.<br>
Finally, he calls home and relates the story in his<br>
native English.<br>
<p>
On each switch, he feels as if he is escaping a mental<br>
straightjacket that was consuming effort and limiting<br>
his choice of expression; in English, he felt the<br>
thoughts coming fluidly and expressed them exactly as<br>
he wanted with confidence.<br>
<p>
Imagine, then, what might be the next step; what<br>
language--if learned natively--might allow one to easily<br>
and confidently express concepts for which English<br>
would be a restraint?  What would it feel like to lift<br>
that constraint and expand the possibilities of what<br>
one can communicate?<br>
<p>
I'm sure that Hofstaedter had wonderful insights even<br>
in Polish--but he could accomplish much more in his<br>
native English.  If he had learned some other language<br>
as a child--say Lojban (you knew it was coming...)--<br>
how different would his insights have been, and how<br>
effectively might he have communicated them?<br>
