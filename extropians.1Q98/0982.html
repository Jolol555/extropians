 <br>
Eh?!? You're attributing causal relationships between the things I was<br>
talking about that I was carefully not drawing, because they ain't there.<br>
<p>
What I was going on about is the problem that there's a conflict of<br>
interest between people selling health care insurance and people buying <br>
it, and this conflict of interests may be a side-effect of the market<br>
system itself. (Diabetes was the first example that sprang to mind.<br>
It's not a huge cause of car accidents, either, although it's been<br>
fingered as a contributory factor recently.)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Healthcare is probably the most heavily controlled industry on the</i><br>

<p>
That's not what I'm trying to do. Rather, I'm trying to point out <br>
that free market systems are not very good at globally optimizing<br>
some situations, and if anyone could come up with something better ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (particularly when the NHS does it</i><br>

<p>
The NHS _doesn't_ do it badly; it does it very well indeed, given<br>
that it is grossly underfunded and massively oversubscribed. (Compare<br>
the situation with the USA, where per-capital healthcare spending<br>
is 30-50% higher but something like 30% of the population have *no* <br>
healthcare cover at all.) The problem is, life is a 100% fatal<br>
condition, and almost everyone will be willing to spend infinite<br>
resources if they can stave it off for just one more minute; faced<br>
with that kind of demand, what sort of system _can_ allocate<br>
resources fairly?<br>
