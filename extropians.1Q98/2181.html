<p>
Very good points.  In our case it only covers current income for our<br>
S-corp.  This is pretty standard.  I think that any of these other<br>
desires could be contracted with the purchase of the stock, or written<br>
into the Corporation.  It is possible to contract a non-compete<br>
agreement so that all my income must go through this Corporation.  I'm<br>
not sure how to avoid the bankruptcy issue, because any business can<br>
fail at any time.  Generally, I think anything you want can be hammered<br>
out by lawyers and defined in contracts the way you want.  My point is<br>
that an S-corp is pretty close to a personal corporation with limited<br>
ownership in which you can sell profit-shares to others.<br>
