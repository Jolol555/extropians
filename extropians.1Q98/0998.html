Hi!<br>

<p>
This was briefly done with twins, testing the extension of the genes in <br>
intelectual and psychological skills. However with clones it is much more <br>
interesting, first because the environmental similarities between clones are <br>
less than between true twins -- because they don't spend their time in the <br>
womb together neither their early, sometimes even later, development. <br>
Changing the environmental conditions would be therefore very interesting, <br>
changing the "mother" -- the animal in which they develop in fetal states <br>
--, changing their infancy, it would be very interesting indeed.<br>
One more thing I'd like to point is that the environment where an animal <br>
lives, can genetically influence its genes, it's sexual line. For example, <br>
if an animal lives in an environment with few food, it'll create smaller <br>
offspring also because its genes will be coded that way. Applying this to <br>
the mind would be fascinating! For example, if a person lives in a violent <br>
environment, its children will be likely to become violent. The question is <br>
weather this violence comes from the environment where they're raised or if <br>
it also comes from their genes. cloning could answer this questions.<br>

See ya,<br>
