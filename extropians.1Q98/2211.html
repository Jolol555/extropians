I agree on "Star Trek."  No insult is too bad for that series.:)<br>

I have nothing against this because it is more realistic/believeable<br>
anyhow.  The kind of Roak vs. Toohey stuff (a la _The Fountainhead_)<br>
is too much like a caricature, though the father of the dead girl in "VO"<br>
was a bit like a kook -- well beyond your average American.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My point:  **This was not a show for the converted (us).**  Its purpose</i><br>

<i>&gt;I think it did a very good job.</i><br>
<p>
I think it has stylistic flaws (bad acting, predictable plot, so so dialog)<br>
and was a bit too long, though, yes, it did, hopefully, introduce a lot<br>
more people to the ideas in a fashion they could accept.  A full blown<br>
transhumanist presentation would have turned off some but would<br>
have been taken less seriously by most.<br>
<p>
Let's hope it is not the last word but the opening statement in this<br>
more public discussion.<br>

P.S.:  Does anyone consider what follows antiExtropian?<br>
<p>
"...the tragic vision is the only realistic form of true optimism, and the only<br>
sound basis for hope and progress.  The anguish of tragedy can come<br>
only from gigantic loss or waste.  Such loss presuposes that there is<br>
something supremely valuable and dear to be lost; a worthless and<br>
trivial world cannot contain anything whose loss would be worth<br>
mourning." in Frederick Turner's "Moderism: Cure or Disease?" in<br>
