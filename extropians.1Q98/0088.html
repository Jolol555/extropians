Rights of the accused seem to function mostly as insurance against<br>
law-enforcement error. If the entire law-enforcement process as a whole is<br>
100% accurate, then there may be no reason for the accused to have<br>
rights. But 100% accuracy is impossible. Even if the probability of error<br>
is very small, it may be that most people are risk-averse enough to want<br>
the accused to have the right of refusing being scanned.<br>
<p>
Another possible answer is that we want law-enforcement to be less<br>
efficient, not more. In an ideal world where all relationships are<br>
consensual, no law (unless it's unanimous) would be enforceable.<br>
<p>
If you could extract a single bit from someone's mind-state, what would<br>
the bit encode, and whose mind would it be?<br>
