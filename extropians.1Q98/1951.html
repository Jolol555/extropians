<i>&gt;         Well, as the myth goes, it wasn't exactly Tithonus' choice to become</i><br>
<i>&gt; an atrophied immortal; rather, it was Aurora who "stole him away" and</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleaded with Jupiter to grant him this immortality.  This prompts the</i><br>
<i>&gt; question: had Tithonus had a choice in the matter, would he have complied</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the prospect of immortality?</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, that depends on what version of the story you hear. I have the<br>
impression the feelings were mutual, but Aurora was slightly careless<br>
when asking Zeus about immortality. But the graeco-roman gods and<br>
goddesses were never big on informed consent anyway...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         Another perspective that can be taken on the Prometheus myth is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; focus on why Zeus felt it necessary to punish Prometheus.  Was Zeus just a</i><br>
<i>&gt; greedy god, or did he want the human race to find the fire on their own...</i><br>
<i>&gt; without divine intervention?  I think that this is an important way of</i><br>
<i>&gt; looking at the myth.  Perhaps Zeus felt that if Prometheus was to give the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fire to humanity, humans would constantly be thanking the gods for the gift</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than finding things on their own.</i><br>
<p>
An interesting interpretation. "Aww, now you spoiled the whole<br>
fun!". Maybe Zeus gave Pandora her box to make the game a bit harder<br>
for the humans, now when Prometheus had made it too easy.<br>
