I do not agree with the focus of the discussion on this mailing list revolving<br>
around capitalism, communism, and the future.  Most of the ideas I have seen<br>
seem to arise more from political and ideological motivations than sincere<br>
attempts to speculate what the future holds for these socio-economic systems.<br>
<p>
Capitalism, socialism (and its more extreme cousin communism, and most other<br>
socio-economic systems that dot the ideological landscape all arise from one<br>
central "fact of life" in the human experience since antiquity: scarcity of<br>
resources.  I define "scarcity" as a condition where the sum demand for<br>
resources of a given population exceeds the available supply of those<br>
resources.  This is the classic "supply and demand" mechanism which drives any<br>
market.  I find that the distinguishing characteristic between socialism and<br>
capitalism is the degree to which this "supply and demand" mechanism is allowed<br>
to determine who gets what they want and who does not.  "Resources" are defined<br>
as essentially anything that someone wants (for whatever reason).  For capitalis<br>
m, to the extent that a resource is scarce it has a value which is determined<br>
by the dynamics of supply and demand.  For socialism, the supply and demand<br>
dynamics are suppressed as much as possible to ensure an equanimity how many<br>
resources each individual person has.  Both systems allege to be achieve the<br>
optimal allocation of resources among a society, i.e. maximizing happiness or<br>
utlity.  Whether either does better than the other in this regard is a subject<br>
for the political scientists and the economists to debate.<br>
<p>
Scarcity in an MNT Future<br>
<p>
Several people have stated that they believe that capitalism will go the way of<br>
the do-do in the future.  Often a fully realized molecular nanotechnology (MNT)<br>
is cited as a reason for this predicted death of capitalism.  I do not think we<br>
should dismiss capitalism in such a simple fashion.  A MNT future where<br>
production is virtually free and the supply for such resources is virtually<br>
limitless is beguiling.  I can understand why people, even using my definition<br>
of "scarcity" above, could assert that such scarcity would no longer exist<br>
since demand could easily exceed supply.  I submit that the one commodity<br>
(scarce resource) in a MNT future would be MNT itself.  The only real<br>
"object"/"process" with value would be the ability to produce with MNT.  The<br>
crucial question becomes would the supply of MNT exceed the demand for it?<br>
<p>
MNT Monopolies?<br>
<p>
The supply of MNT would be extremely vulnerable to manipulation.  MNT supply<br>
could be virtually limitless and definitely in excess of demand.  However, MNT<br>
could be controlled in some fashion and its supply regulated similar to the<br>
DeBeers/diamonds and OPEC/crude oil situations of the present.  MNT would be so<br>
hard to contain, since if even a few assemblers "got out" they could render any<br>
MNT monopoly obsolete in a matter of week, that if a MNT monopoly ever existed<br>
it would probably be the most absolute institution in terms of power and<br>
control to exist in history.  It would have to be to control the supply of MNT.<br>
<p>
Drexler warned of the dangers of "stumbling into" the MNT age.  The threat of<br>
MNT monopoly would be scary indeed not only for individuals but also for<br>
governments who realized they would not be a part of it.  Maybe we can hope<br>
that in attempts to ensure it was never subjected to such absolute control, a<br>
scrupulous government or corporation would make MNT freely available long<br>
enough for it to proliferate.<br>
<p>
Scarity in an Age of Autarky?<br>
<p>
If the supply of MNT did exceed demand, each individual would essentially be<br>
self-sufficient.  Speculations on the technologies emerging out of MNT hint at<br>
the possibilities of ancient institutions in the human experience being<br>
rendered obsolete such as : the necessity of mates for reproduction (marriage),<br>
death, limitations of the human experience in general (intelligence, insight,<br>
physical limits, etc.).  What would be considered scarce in such a future?<br>
Scarcity may arise from limitations so basic and fundamental that vast<br>
technologies beyond even MNT would be required to eliminate them.  (note: I<br>
find the same confrontation with fundamental scarcity arising in a future where<br>
superintelligent artifical life-forms [assuming they are competitive] race at e<br>
xponential speeds to usurp one another)  Aspects of the universe such as time,<br>
energy, mass, heat (a derivative of time), etc. would become the fundamental<br>
limits that (trans)humans in an MNT future would confront.  The vast<br>
technologies needed to eliminate them?  Tapping into additional supplies of<br>
these resources which I can only determine would be possible by accessing other<br>
universes (this assuming the multiverse speculations of Lee Smolin et. al. are<br>
true).  Is there some resource more fundamental (and immune to the machinations<br>
of life) than time, etc,?  I can not imagine what it would be.<br>
