John Clark:<br>
: &gt; If diabetics pay less than they should<br>
: &gt; then non diabetics will have to pay more.<br>
<p>
Charlie Stross:<br>
: That's the 'market knows best' answer. I am not happy with it. It<br>
: subordinates ethics to market realities. (The ethical viewpoint being<br>
: "everybody should have access to equal treatment, in an ideal world"<br>
<p>
Hey, if all you want is *equal* treatment for diabetics, no problem.<br>
I had assumed that you wanted *more* treatment for diabetics.<br>
(This is not a joke.)<br>
<p>
: and the market viewpoint being "you get what you pays for".)<br>
<p>
Not exactly - the market ethic (imho) is more like "everyone has<br>
different priorities, and to rank them externally is favoritism."<br>
<p>
(later)<br>
: What I was going on about is the problem that there's a conflict of<br>
: interest between people selling health care insurance and people buying<br>
: it, and this conflict of interests may be a side-effect of the market<br>
: system itself.<br>
<p>
There's always a conflict between two people who want to use the same<br>
resources for different purposes; you can't blame that on the market.<br>
Exchange is a way of bringing these conflicting desires into harmony.<br>
<p>
: &gt; ( ... the NHS does it so badly, and severely restricts treatment<br>
: &gt; for the elderly folks who need it the most).<br>
:<br>
: The NHS _doesn't_ do it badly; it does it very well indeed, given<br>
: that it is grossly underfunded and massively oversubscribed.<br>
<p>
By its very nature, the NHS will inevitably be oversubscribed (and<br>
a Public Choice economist might say it's inevitably underfunded).<br>
<p>
Venice handles floods very well, considering that it is awash,<br>
but I still wouldn't store valuable papers there.  (Now accepting<br>
nominations for a better metaphor)<br>
<p>
: (Compare the situation with the USA, where per-capital healthcare<br>
: spending is 30-50% higher but something like 30% of the population<br>
: have *no* healthcare cover at all.)<br>
<p>
That's largely an artifact of WW2 wage controls, strangely enough.<br>
Employers forbidden to raise wages tried sweetening the deal by<br>
throwing in benefits like medical insurance; eventually this was<br>
made tax-exempt, which meant that job-tied insurance was suddenly<br>
far cheaper than private insurance, which meant that the whole<br>
medical industry was soon geared to job-tied insurance, which is<br>
a stupidly brittle way to run it.<br>
<p>
(There are sporadic attempts to level the field, and thus open it,<br>
with such devices as tax-exempt medical savings accounts; I gather<br>
that bills to this effect usually fade under cries of "tax giveaways<br>
for the rich!", but the idea isn't going away.)<br>
<p>
Burden the system further with rules mandating, for example, that I<br>
can't get medical insurance that does *not* cover drug addiction rehab<br>
(surely after thirty-odd years I should have a good idea whether or not<br>
I'm at risk?), or that private insurers *must* give premium discounts<br>
for X but must *not* take Y into account -- and it's no wonder that<br>
the insurance market is a mare's nest.<br>
<p>
And then of course there are the byzantine Medicare rules, under which<br>
physicians big-hearted enough to accept Medicare patients spend hours<br>
on paperwork to get paid a fraction of their normal fee ...<br>
<p>
And now we hear the government announce that there are too many doctors!<br>
<p>
: The problem is, life is a 100% fatal condition, and almost everyone<br>
: will be willing to spend infinite resources if they can stave it off<br>
: for just one more minute; faced with that kind of demand, what sort<br>
: of system _can_ allocate resources fairly?<br>
<p>
The first problem is defining "fairly".<br>
