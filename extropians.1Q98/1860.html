Heirloom crop preservation is a *great* idea, and I have never<br>
understood why the major seed companies don't embrace it<br>
enthusiastically.  There's bound to be really useful genes<br>
that have been lost from the current crop lines, and anybody<br>
who ends up owning any of those genes (by owning all their<br>
remaining representatives) will be worth a fortune.  <br>

<p>
Indeed an excellent example of how biodiversity can be a boon.<br>
However, we still grow varieties of that strain.  Oddly, although<br>
preserved biodiversity in wild potatos demonstrably has fixes<br>
for the potato blight, we haven't used them.<br>
