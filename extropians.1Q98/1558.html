David Brin has a similar idea in his Transparent Society.  He had an<br>
article about this in a recent issue of Wired, and is coming out with<br>
a book on the subject in May, 1998.  He envisions widespread use of<br>
surveillance cameras and other kinds of monitoring devices.  This will<br>
prevent many forms of crime and dishonesty.<br>
<p>
One problem with the idea is that people do like their privacy, and so<br>
they may try to use technologies to protect it.  Encryption, anonymous<br>
communications, digital cash, and similar tools can be used to allow<br>
people to interact while preserving privacy.  No doubt you are right that<br>
there will be costs involved in using these, but there will be those<br>
who find the costs worthwhile.  You then are faced with the prospect<br>
of using coercion to prevent people from using technologies to protect<br>
their privacy, in order to achieve your desired result.<br>
<p>
That's where I draw the line.  If people want to voluntarily give up<br>
privacy, that's fine.  But they should not force others to do the same.<br>
<p>
As long as you or David want to predict that society will voluntarily<br>
move into a culture where there is no more lying, no more adultery, no<br>
more secrets, and no more privacy, that's fine.  I'm skeptical, because<br>
this would be such a total change in human culture that it is hard for<br>
me to imagine.  Most of the conflicts explored in classic fiction would<br>
become impossible.  (I accused David of wanting to make stories about<br>
illicit sexual affairs the exclusive domain of science fiction writers<br>
like himself.)<br>
<p>
The problem arises when people become so excited about this marvelous<br>
new world that they are willing to use force to get there.  I think<br>
most of us would agree that these changes should be adopted voluntarily.<br>
People should be free to expose more of their private lives to public<br>
scrutiny, with the decisions being made on an individual basis.<br>
