<i>&gt;On the one hand, nanotechnology renders traditional economic models obsolete</i><br>
until<br>
<i>&gt;another (transient) resource limit is hit.</i><br>
Not to argue with your other points, but on this one, I have often heard some<br>
people stating similar beliefs.  I can't agree.  First, as far as I can<br>
see, no<br>
one has ever paid the earth for yielding up its raw materials.  All money goes<br>
to paying for labor and for turning over ownership of materials currently<br>
owned<br>
by someone else.  In a nanotech world, labor is spent on software and for the<br>
creation of other information, and this labor is not free.  This resource<br>
limit<br>
is the main limit in today's economy (finite brains), and I don't see a change<br>
coming.  A nanotech future contains a *lot* of software, and massive<br>
complexity.  It will take tremendous work to achieve some of the advancements<br>
we want.  This is not completely different than the present economy.  In many<br>
areas of technology, an exponential increase in brain power is needed to<br>
make a<br>
linear increase in product complexity.<br>
