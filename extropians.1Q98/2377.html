From: Reilly Jones &lt;Reilly@compuserve.com&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In America, no political conclusion has been reached, only a</i><br>
<i>&gt;judicial usurpation of the political question.  This is judicial</i><br>
<i>&gt;tyranny, to define away human life without recourse to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Constitutional Amendment process, such as was used when slavery</i><br>
<i>&gt;was abolished.  Slavery and abortion are all about the private</i><br>
<i>&gt;ownership and disposition of human life.  The crux of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;philosophical issues in both cases was and continues to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;definitional. My alternative is polycentrism, or particularism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;many jurisdictions trying out many different treatments of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;issue.  The judiciary cannot usurp the legislative role. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Individuals should have the choice to move to jurisdictions that</i><br>
<i>&gt;honor life, or that worship death.  The type of society that</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolves in each jurisdiction will provide the incentive or</i><br>
<i>&gt;disincentive for movement, but I know from moral reasoning from</i><br>
<i>&gt;first principles that families trying to raise children will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;drawn towards jurisdictions with an ethic of protecting and</i><br>
<i>&gt;enhancing life.</i><br>
<p>
No political question or conclusion is necessary, until an<br>
individual is "born" (thus becoming an individual) the constitution<br>
does not apply.<br>
<p>
You argue about inconsistency, yet the so called "right to life"<br>
movement is one of the most inconsistent i.e. they support the<br>
death penalty.<br>
<p>
Yes, I support the right of choice.<br>
<p>
If the so called "right to life " movement is so concerned about<br>
abortion, why haven't they ever tried to support birth control,<br>
thus eliminating most, if not all, abortions?<br>
