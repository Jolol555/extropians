I'm always disturbed when I'm using a piece of software that's flawed in<br>
obvious ways and in ways that seriously limit the functionality of the<br>
software or it's ease of use.  I always come up with good ideas for<br>
fixing the problems and am frustrated by the fact that my ideas will not<br>
be implemented.  But I have reason to believe this will not be a problem<br>
in the future.<br>
<p>
As the Internet expands, as bandwidth increases, as e-cash becomes<br>
standard and as trusted systems become widely prevalent, I can foresee<br>
much software being distributed through the Internet on a pay-as-you-use<br>
basis.  The software will likely be component-based software, where each<br>
component could be designed by different programmers, who are paid some<br>
small amount each time their component is used (the cost of using the<br>
software would be the sum of the cost of running the components which are<br>
run).  This would allow someone who sees a flaw in some piece of software<br>
or something they want to add on to improve the software, to make those<br>
changes, and when people use the components that they have added, they<br>
will be paid for it.<br>
<p>
I'm sure a lot of companies will still copyright their software and not<br>
allow it to be modified, but I know a lot of people would encourage<br>
others to improve their software.  Of course, then we'd end up with<br>
thousands of different versions of one piece of software, at varying<br>
degrees of quality.  This naturally leads to some sort of selection<br>
system; people want to use good software, but they don't have time to<br>
evaluate thousands of different pieces of software.  So they pay people<br>
to do it for them.  I can see Web sites which offer really good software,<br>
for a small fee, of course.<br>
<p>
Basically, this could allow software to evolve much more than it does<br>
today.  There is a real financial motive for programmers to improve<br>
software, even if they didn't design the original version.  The original<br>
programmers benefit from this public modification of their software since<br>
most of what they wrote (and will get paid for) is unlikely to be<br>
modified much in the short term, at least, and any improvements to their<br>
software will only serve to make it more competitive and used more often,<br>
and thus they will get paid more.<br>
<p>
The details of how to keep track of who wrote what and how to determine<br>
pricing and how to make it difficult to get around paying for what you<br>
use are somewhat tricky, but I have high confidence that it can, and<br>
will, be done.  I look forward to that time.<br>
