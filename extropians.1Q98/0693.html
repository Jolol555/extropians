John Clark said<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's possible to explain the operation of a Quantum Computer without </i><br>
<i>&gt; resorting to the Many Worlds theory, but doing so is convoluted and difficult, </i><br>
<i>&gt; if you were to program such a machine I believe it would be more productive </i><br>
<i>&gt; to think not of one device but of trillions running in parallel. Of course </i><br>
<i>&gt; nobody has made a Quantum Computer, but I predict that if somebody ever does</i><br>
<i>&gt; then Many Worlds will become the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics </i><br>
<i>&gt; because it will be the easiest way to think about certain problems.</i><br>
<p>
I would like to see someone explain the operation of a quantum computer<br>
*using* Many Worlds theory!<br>
