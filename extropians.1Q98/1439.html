DOUG.BAILEY@ey.com &lt;extropians@extropy.com&gt; polled:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would like to take a survey of opinions on this list regarding the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Strong AI hypothesis.</i><br>
<p>
	I think we can already do it, we just need a lot more of the<br>
same.  For example, we can produce a machine that can tell us what<br>
color something is much better than we can.  Such machines are aware<br>
of what color something is much better than we are.  But this is all<br>
missing the real point of what our consciousness is built out of.  Our<br>
knowledge of color is represented by phenomenal color qualia or<br>
feelings or sensations.  A "strong AI" device represent color with<br>
abstract sets of bits.  The fundamental quality of these<br>
representations is, by design, not relevant.  But to us the particular<br>
fundamental qualia or sensation we use to represent a particular color<br>
(and what it is fundamentally like), which is our knowledge of what<br>
color something is, is all important.  If you swap the hardware<br>
representations of two particular colors in a "strong AI" machine,<br>
there is no significant difference.  But if we represent 700 nm light<br>
with a green sensation rather than a red one, there is all the<br>
difference in the world!<br>
<p>
	I say yes, strong AI is possible given an absurd amount of<br>
increased and unnecessary complexity.  A "strong AI" device isn't<br>
"strong" enough because it lacks our phenomenal ability to represent<br>
knowledge in more than almost meaningless and non unified "abstract"<br>
ways.<br>
