<i>&gt; they are now, just like most of the other members of the justice system. </i><br>
<i>&gt; If one would be accused of a crime, he could hire as many people to *prove</i><br>

<i>&gt; in fact be streamlined: he must present sufficient hard evidence to prove</i><br>
<i>&gt; that his client didn't commit the crime(s) he's been accused of. No more,</i><br>
<i>&gt; no less.</i><br>
<p>
Guilty until proven innocent?  Are you sure that this is the standard <br>
you want to be ruled under?<br>
