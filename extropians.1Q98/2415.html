I have no desire to personally take them to court on this (I currently have<br>
no economic incentive to do so), nor do I want to obtain the patent from<br>
them.  My gripe is primarily that these patents *should* be part of the<br>
public domain.  <br>
<p>
I fault the chimps at the U.S. PTO for letting this kind of nonsense occur<br>
at the expense of the industry at large.  It creates a software patent arms<br>
race by software companies (patent or die) with the PTO too clueless to<br>
even keep that at a reasonable level.  Because of cases like the OpenMarket<br>
patents, I have a strong incentive to patent every scribble in my notepads;<br>
 I do not want to get into the scenario where I develop something and then<br>
have to pay someone else to use it because they patented some obscene<br>
device at a later date that covers my unpatented work.  At the very least I<br>
would be faced with an expensive court battle to prove otherwise.<br>
<p>
This isn't the first time I have seen this happen to me.  I have been<br>
working on the bleeding edge of the web since the early days and had<br>
developed numerous techniques and technologies that were later "invented"<br>
and patented by other parties.  After a while this starts to get to me.<br>
I've never patented anything or taken credit for any developments because I<br>
don't care.  I get paid either way and I realize that any competent<br>
developer could have done the same thing if they were required to.  This is<br>
the main absurdity of most software patents:  These patents in no way allow<br>
us to do something now that we didn't know how to do before; the PTO is<br>
under the illusion that knowing how to write a piece of software is somehow<br>
different than actually doing it.  These types of patents therefore seem<br>
better suited to copyright law rather than patent law.<br>
