Girls transcend the distinction how?<br>

I think I've read that Old English originally had another word meaning 'male<br>
humans' and that 'man' was originally restricted to its inclusive sense, like<br>
andros and gynos vs. anthropos in Greek.  Can anyone confirm this?  I find<br>
that 'Man' and 'Mankind' work much better in poetry than 'human' and<br>
'humanity', and would rather record a word for 'male human' rather than change<br>
the species-word.  This would also save 'chairman' and the like.<br>
