<i>&gt;hippocampus. It seems that the cannabioids have an overall inhibitory</i><br>
<i>&gt;effect on the hippocampus, leading to memory impairments (Drew et al</i><br>
<i>&gt;1980). In fact, an antagonist has shown nootropic effects by improving</i><br>
<i>&gt;memory (Terranova 1996). This, coupled with the decrease in motivation</i><br>
<i>&gt;(a serotonin inhibition effect?) doesn't suggest them as very useful</i><br>
<i>&gt;for a transhuman other than as chemical entertainment.</i><br>
<p>
I have no intention of discussing this in the abstract.<br>
<p>
Set and setting may play a very large role in exactly what is inhibited and<br>
how it is interpreted or employed. I have little doubt that I could tailor<br>
an experiment to produce those results, and I am aware that they are part<br>
of the lore of hemp use. But I know people whose results differ. I think it<br>
has to do with where and how you practice placement of your attention. <br>
<p>
As another point, is catalytic use of cannabinoids to trigger healing of<br>
psychological wounds something you would define as "chemical<br>
entertainment"? :) When does hedonics not equal transcendence? :)<br>

<i>&gt;&lt;Neuroscientist speculation mode on&gt; It is interesting to speculate</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the feelings of meaningfulness and profound insights are related</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome. And also the model that</i><br>
<i>&gt;hippocampal region CA1 does novelty/familiarity detection of</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiences (see for example "Encoding and Retrieval of Episodic</i><br>
<i>&gt;Memories: Role of Cholinergic and GABAergic Modulation in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Huippocampus" by Michael E. Hasselmo, Bradley P. Wyble and Gene</i><br>
<i>&gt;V. Wallenstein in Hippocampus 6:693-708 (1996)). Is marijuana use</i><br>
<i>&gt;linked to feelings of Deja vu or its opposite? If this holds, it could</i><br>
<i>&gt;mess up the familiarity/novelty detection systems, making the user</i><br>
<i>&gt;think that a new experience was familiar or an old experience fresh</i><br>
<i>&gt;and new.  &lt;Neuroscientist speculation mode on&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Actually, such a mode of partially inducing "beginner's mind" has its uses<br>
too, but more in synthesis and pattern-breaking (an element of what we<br>
sometimes call creativity). This is again predicated on the intention on<br>
creating, rather than just sitting around saying "wow" a lot.<br>
<p>
Have you read Lakeoff's _Women, Fire and Dangerous Things_? It's about the<br>
function and failure of categories. I found it a compelling read, except<br>
for the cases at the very end (which were dry academic props for the<br>
material that had gone before).<br>
