It's not just governments playing games with security.  One of my<br>
clients is IBM Corp.  They sold Lotus Notes systems to the Swedish<br>
Government with high-level encryption.  Normally, high-level encryption<br>
is not legally exportable, but IBM got a special waiver from the U.S.<br>
Government.  Everybody was happy, until recently.  The Swedes found out<br>
that the way IBM got the waiver was to give the NSA a copy of all<br>
decryption keys for every system they shipped.  Thus, the U.S.<br>
Government has decryption capability for all of the Swedish Government's<br>
new computers.  The Swedish Government is NOT happy about this, and does<br>
not understand how this could be done without their knowledge or<br>
consent.  They currently are investigating, and are considering this a<br>
breach of their national security by IBM Corp.<br>
