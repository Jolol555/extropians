<i>&gt; Extropians List subscribers could be construed by mainstreamers to:</i><br>
<i>&gt; a) have social dysfunctions indicated by the fact they spend so much time</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussing strange topics on an internet mail list, therefore have</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficulty interacting with people in the 'real' world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; b) have a difficulty distinguishing their internet life from their real</i><br>
<i>&gt; lives (if they have real lives), and in fantasizing about htings like mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; uploading and a mythical transhuman singularity, nanotechnology and jupiter</i><br>
<i>&gt; brains, have difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; c) in their wishes to upload their minds (which seems like it would be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; destructive process), support the right to suicide, promote the use of guns</i><br>
<i>&gt; for self defense, and have themselves frozen, they demonstrate a lack of</i><br>
<i>&gt; concern for their own safety and well being, and are likely to hurt</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So an active and dedicated extropian could be construed to be quite ill.</i><br>
<p>
Good try. And I have no doubt that some people would agree with you (I<br>
have a friend (!) who distrusts *anything* I say since I'm obviously<br>
"mad" because I discuss uploading and similar topics). But if you ask<br>
any serious psychologist och clinical psychiatrist, they will at most<br>
agree with a and b, and that is just a fairly benign personality<br>
disorder (compared to what they usually deal with, it is). Of course,<br>
if you go to a psychoterapist, he will immediately tell you that you<br>
are ill and in need of help, but they say that to everybody (OK, I'm<br>
not very fond of psychotherapy :-).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thats my point. The members of this list are entirely TOO rational and</i><br>
<i>&gt; logical, as compared to the general population. That we can rationally</i><br>
<i>&gt; discuss such theoretical subjects as a transhuman singularity without (too</i><br>
<i>&gt; frequently) going off on almost theological trysts indicates that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; members of this list are not normal.</i><br>
<p>
Quite. And who wants to be normal? Normal people are so boring! The<br>
trick is to avoid being normal while retaining sanity.<br>
