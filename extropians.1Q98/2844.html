First of all, I'm sure you realize that personal anecdotes can't settle<br>
this issue. I have no doubt that you and your friends are model<br>
citizens. But you may be unusual. I, unfortunately, cannot cite specific<br>
statistical studies at this time. (I know there are a lot of them,<br>
however, and I will try to look them up when I have more time.) However,<br>
if my memory is correct, there  is a strong correlation between<br>
criminality and coming from a single parent home, even if the parent is<br>
not poor. If anyone on the list can help me out with these statistics, I<br>
would appreciate it. I would be flabbergasted if, as you suggest, kids<br>
from two parent families are more likely to commit crimes. However, if<br>
you can prove it,  knock me over! If your argument is correct, then it<br>
would be a good thing for kids if all fathers dropped dead immediately<br>
after insemination. Surely that must strike you as a bit bizarre and<br>
counterintuitive, even without any statistical analysis.<br>
