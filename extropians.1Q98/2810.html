<i>&gt; The best definition of freedom probably comes from the anarcho-socialists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not being oppressed by power structures while, at the same time, helping to</i><br>
<i>&gt; advance evolution. Such a freedom is entirely impossible in a "free market".</i><br>
<p>
Why?<br>
<p>
Or rather: what the heck does "helping to advance evolution" mean?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Christians murdered millions, buried the knowledge of the Romans and</i><br>
<i>&gt; maintained power (and stagnation) for nearly one millenium. The Dark Ages</i><br>
<i>&gt; were the worst time this planet has ever gone through.</i><br>
<p>
The knowledge of the Romans was generally borrowed from the Greeks; Rome<br>
was a conqueror, not an inventor.<br>
<p>
It might be interesting to go back in time and prevent the rise of<br>
Christianity, but I doubt that would have saved the Empire from<br>
collapsing of its own tax structure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I disagree, as the idea that the state has the right to use deadly force in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;redistributing my property which they confiscate from me without due process or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;proper Constitutional authority is not even worth discussing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because you don't consider yourself as a part of the human community, but as</i><br>
<p>
Non sequitur.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; an isolated being which has, for some strange reasons, the right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; accumulate scarce goods and the currency necessary to acquire them.</i><br>
<p>
"some strange reasons" indeed.   Individualism bad, collectivism good,<br>
Capitalism bad, plunder good ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Accumulation of information, external sensors and memory, the transhuman</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'properties' you described, is OK. But in today's world, the resources must</i><br>
<i>&gt; be distributed equally in order to allow everyone to participate in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; great game of life.</i><br>
<p>
Everyone participates, even if we cannot all participate equally.  I'd<br>
like to participate equally with Martin Cradick or Donald Knuth, but I<br>
haven't got the talent; who will correct that maldistribution?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ... By my definition, a transhuman is a being</i><br>
<i>&gt; which has already transcended, and such a being does, according to my</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge, not exist on this planet. We're still unconnected carbon bags</i><br>
<i>&gt; filled with water. As such, we are all dependant on this planet's resources.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Private property of goods and currency must not exist in an environment</i><br>
<i>&gt; where goods are not reproducable.</i><br>
<p>
On the contrary, private property must inevitably exist where goods are<br>
not infinite.<br>
<p>
See, I can make naked assertions too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; .... The Americans didn't become a superpower</i><br>
<i>&gt; because they were so clever. They've earned a golden nose with both World</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wars, whereas the British Empire was eliminated as a superpower already</i><br>
<i>&gt; after WW I. The German economy didn't fare so well after WW II because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; politicians were so intelligent, but because it was greatly funded by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; US.</i><br>
<p>
Agree in part - but, you know, it wasn't by mere chance that Americans<br>
won the wars.  Why didn't Brazil (for example), which had similar<br>
advantages of size and isolation, win them?<br>
<p>
I like to think it's not *only* military power that makes Americana<br>
fashionable around the world ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; History could also look completely different, if, after WW I, Germany had</i><br>
<i>&gt; decided to cooperate with Russia. Such a plan was made, by Weimar state</i><br>
<i>&gt; secretary Rathenau. Remember the contract of Rapallo? It allowed the Germans</i><br>
<i>&gt; to quit reparation payments and to build and test weapons in the SU.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately (probably), Rathenau was assassinated in 1922.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, Lee Harvey Oswald was assassinated two days later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I wouldn't call this kind of selection natural.  [...]</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't call it relevant, either, unless you can show how these<br>
killings affected *culture*.<br>
