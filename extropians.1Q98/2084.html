The data and hypotheses as you state them only say that CR qua CR doesn't<br>
help.<br>
No reputable CRAN proponent leaves out the AN (adequate/optimum nutrition)<br>
part.<br>
Show me human work that controls for the presence or absence of AN throughout <br>
the life of the subject, and I may be willing to concede the study has some <br>
applicability. As it stands, all you're saying is that starvation doesn't<br>
help.<br>
<p>
Well, duh.<br>
<p>
FWIW, my BMI is way higher than I want it to be. I'll chance the<br>
possibility that <br>
CRAN may make my life (including exercise) more fun, even if it doesn't<br>
extend it.<br>
<p>
YMMV.<br>

<i>&gt;    There has been some speculation that caloric restriction might be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to retard the rate of aging, and extend maximum human life span beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; 120 years of age. (For example see the book "The 120 Year Diet" by Roy</i><br>
<i>&gt; Walford)</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Recent evidence indicates that the anti-aging effect of caloric</i><br>
<i>&gt; restriction, which has been documented in rodents, is not operative in</i><br>
<i>&gt; humans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    A low body-mass index does have a positive association with reduced</i><br>
<i>&gt; mortality rates in humans. However recent research indicates that this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; due to a negative association between BMI and physical fitness. After</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical fitness is accounted for, there exists no further effect of BMI</i><br>
<i>&gt; on mortality. See the following table from (International Journal of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Obesity 19 Suppl: S41-S44 1995.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                     All Cause Death Rates</i><br>
<i>&gt;    BMI                    Fitness</i><br>
<i>&gt;                   Low     Moderate   High</i><br>
<i>&gt;    &lt;27            52.1      28.6      20.0</i><br>
<i>&gt;   27-30           49.1      29.8      19.7</i><br>
<i>&gt;    &gt;30            62.1           18.0         (moderate &amp; high together)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     While the above data indicate that the body mass index itself is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; a primary driving factor for mortality in humans, the case it makes</i><br>
<i>&gt; against caloric restriction exerting an anti-aging effect is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; air-tight. What is needed is a false prediction from a postulated</i><br>
<i>&gt; anti-aging effect of caloric restriction that could then be used in turn</i><br>
<i>&gt; to falsify that hypothesis. I believe there exists one such prediction.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Lower BMI is associated with reduced mortality in young and</i><br>
<i>&gt; middle-aged humans. If caloric restriction retards the rate of aging and</i><br>
<i>&gt; extends maximum life span in humans one must expect that a lower BMI</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be significantly associated with reduced mortality in aged humans.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If such an significant association is not found then caloric intake is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not operative in modifying the rate of aging in humans and life spans</i><br>
<i>&gt; beyond 120 will not be possible by reducing caloric intake.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     In humans over 84 years of age BMI has not been found to exert any</i><br>
<i>&gt; significant effect on mortality. (New England Journal of Medicine 338:</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1-7 1998 &amp; Arch Intern Med 157: 2249-2258 1997) Therefore since no</i><br>
<i>&gt; association has been found between BMI and mortality in aged humans, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; caloric restriction is not operative in modifying the rate of aging in</i><br>
<i>&gt; humans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     The fact that caloric restriction dramatically extends life span in</i><br>
<i>&gt; mice, but not apparently in humans requires some explanation. Here is</i><br>
<i>&gt; one. In mice caloric restriction is associated with torpor, which can act</i><br>
<i>&gt; to reduce tumor growth. In C57BL/6J mice blocking torpor, by increasing</i><br>
<i>&gt; housing temperature to 30 C reduced the increase in average life span</i><br>
<i>&gt; associated with caloric restriction from 47% to just 4%. Since humans</i><br>
<i>&gt; neither experience torpor, nor suffer from cancer to the degree that mice</i><br>
<i>&gt; do the effect of caloric restriction in mice can not be generalized to</i><br>
<i>&gt; include humans. For example in human centenarians only 4% die from</i><br>
<i>&gt; cancer. By comparison cardiovascular disease accounts for 63% of deaths</i><br>
<i>&gt; in those aged 95 and over. (Epidemiology 8: 501-504 1997) Thus it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; cardiovascular disease and not cancer that is the major longevity</i><br>
<i>&gt; limiting factor in humans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     It is possible that potassium intake may be a major dietary modulator</i><br>
<i>&gt; of human longevity. A high potassium intake has been found to reduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; stroke associated mortality to zero. (New England Journal of Medicine</i><br>
<i>&gt; 316: 235-240 1987)</i><br>
