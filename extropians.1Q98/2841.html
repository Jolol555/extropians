John, you're being at least as dogmatic and simplistic as you accuse Brin of<br>
being.  The style of argument you use to demolish free will and souls doesn't<br>
work as well here.<br>

<p>
How, when people and watchdog programs are watching you or at least the<br>
records and each other, redundantly?  Earlier you talked about splicing into<br>
the network "they can't be watching me all the time".  But they can watch the<br>
network cables.  For that matter, the cables themselves might be 'smart'.<br>
"Help!  I'm broken!  Come look at me!"<br>
<p>
You've also said it's unstable, because if everyone's being open but you you<br>
have an advantage.  But the projected openness isn't based on voluntary<br>
transparency, like altruism; it's based on snooping technology being better<br>
than secrecy technology.  How will you use this secret?  Insider trading would<br>
be hard to detect, but the extended obtaining of that information would be<br>
high risk.  Conversely a new invention could be stored in your brain but would<br>
be hard to implement secretly.<br>
<p>
The transparent society (at least one version) isn't fron unanimous surrender<br>
of secrecy; it's the result of extensive and more widespread snooping and<br>
spying.  Thirty years ago we caught Nixon's burglaries by accident, and found<br>
out more about him because of his own fetish for recordings; today we argue<br>
over whether Clinton had an affair inside the White House and some police cars<br>
are equipped with cameras.  This is stable.<br>
<p>
Whereas a world of total encryption might well be vulnerable to a new<br>
algorithm or a quantum computer.  _That_ sort of secret would be exploitable<br>
-- to the detriment of everyone else.  Call that stable?  Hah.<br>
<p>
And quantum cryptography isn't a cure-all yet, with its dependence on direct<br>
fiber links, not for the Internet as a whole.<br>
<p>
And then there's the TEMPEST arms race.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; from hackers you'd vastly increase the meddling of the truth from world </i><br>
<i>&gt; leaders, that is, from the network administrators.</i><br>
<p>
More than one network, and they're watchable.<br>
<p>
<p>
This will be mostly driven by the technology, and a few social decisions.<br>
(Whether private street cameras are illegal, or whether everyone can tap in,<br>
and watch the police station as well.  Whether people actually have secrecy at<br>
home, or simply seclusion -- you can be watched at home, but not disturbed,<br>
and perhaps use of that information is restricted somehow.)  The result is<br>
unlikely to be all of one or the other, and likely to change over time.  RSA<br>
gets cracked; people use overlapping quantum crypto networks; teeny cameras<br>
and TEMPEST see everything your computer does anyway; teeny camera-hunters and<br>
counter-TEMPEST measures strike back; etc.<br>
