<i>&gt; SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft and other high-tech companies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which say they face a critical shortage of programmers and</i><br>
<i>&gt; engineers, this week will ask Congress to eliminate the hiring</i><br>
<i>&gt; cap on foreign professionals.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers-USA, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; leading U.S. professional group for electrical and electronics</i><br>
<i>&gt; engineers, wants to retain the current limit.</i><br>
<p>
This is a recurring argument between the engineers and industry, about every<br>
five years or so, whenever things get good economically.  the IEEE takes the<br>
predictable stance for its constituents.<br>
<p>
Interesting, the thought of high-tech workers becoming a "Global Privileged<br>
Elite", though I'm not sure I like the sound of "Privileged Elite".  Global,<br>
that's good enough for me.<br>
<p>
The reason high-tech companies have a shortage is that they don't want to pay<br>
more for us geeks if they can avoid it.  Despite record low unemployment for<br>
engineers and programmers, except in certain specialties and areas (the SF Bay<br>
area, ASIC design), wages have hardly increased for years.  There may be a<br>
shortage, but not enough of one to increase the $incentive for students to<br>
choose a high-tech career over other options.  Or even for experienced<br>
engineers to remain engineers.  Elite? Hardly.  And who can say that they<br>
should make more than some foreigner of equal skills?  I can't justify a<br>
foreign hiring cap even though it's to my short-term benefit.<br>
<p>
There has never been a talent shortage, just a shortage of cheap talent.  No<br>
shortage of cheap, crafty businessmen.<br>
