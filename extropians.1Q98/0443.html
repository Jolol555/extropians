<i>&gt; &gt; As usual the popular media has latched on to this as a headline grabber</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; designed to attract a scientifically ignorant mass audience. Regrettably,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; most of the editors in the mass media seem to be as scientifically ignorant</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as their readers and viewers. As to the general morality of most of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; editors of the media, I somehow doubt that many of them even know the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; meaning of the word.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's not a meaningful criticism of the press; you and I personally</i><br>
<i>&gt; have just about opposite definitions of "moral", yet we happen to</i><br>
<i>&gt; agree (contrary to the minority) that the act of cloning yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt; is OK.  The relevant question to me seems to be "What are the real</i><br>
<i>&gt; memetic influences that make the majority believe what they do, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; what can we do about it?"  I think blaming religion here falls</i><br>
<i>&gt; short of the whole story.  Even many avowed atheists are uncomfortable</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the idea.  Some who are all in favor of "technology" when it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; made of plastic are less enthusiastic when it comes to cells.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What is it that they fear?  What can we do to assuage that fear or</i><br>
<i>&gt; (often more effective) to ridicule it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
SInce people view their genes as 'theirs', and that they as individuals<br>
don't want anybody out there being produced from their genes without<br>
their knowledge or say so. This is an entirely rational privacy issue.<br>
Where people go wrong is that since they cannot ever conceive of a<br>
personal need for the technology (unless they happen to be an unluck<br>
sterile individual), then the only real use for it would be by<br>
governments or corporations to do their own experimentation on a persons<br>
genes without their knowledge (would you feel good if your offspring<br>
were being tortured and enslaved??), or even being able to replace<br>
people in a 'body snatcher' kind of way. The other meme out there is the<br>
religious one that views anything but completely natural conception and<br>
birth as unnatural, against gods will, etc. The old "if man were meant<br>
to fly, god would've given him wings" routine, despite the high<br>
percentage of the existing population who survived childbirth only due<br>
to drastic technological intervention.<br>
<p>
I also think that the word "cloning" has a negative semantic value.<br>
Pro-cloning people should publicly redefine their position with a much<br>
more acceptable catch phrase, like 'artificial twinning', 'assisted<br>
twinning', much in the way pro-abortion activists redefined themselves<br>
as "Pro-Choice", while the anti-'choice' activists redefined themselves<br>
as "Pro-Life". Both phrases seem to be representing positive things that<br>
all people would like to be for.<br>
<p>
I would be interested to hear from Kathryn what the Pro-Choice<br>
establishment feels about Assisted Twinning....<br>
