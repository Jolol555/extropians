I have been thinking about people's motivations lately.<br>
<p>
Finally, someone bold enough to tackle some big questions.<br>
<p>
<p>
There are some obvious drives.  Self-respect, power, money,<br>
recognition. . . . They can still play a motivational<br>
role if one wants to get as much of them as possible, but the<br>
continuing motivation by goals that are no longer rational<br>
(and apparently are not analyzed) seems to be a serious<br>
weakness by itself.  I would recommend anybody in such<br>
state to stop whatever they are doing for these goals, and<br>
try to understand why they do it, and whether they should.<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks for bringing it up, Alex.  Alex seems to be asking why we strive for <br>
acheivement, knowledge or whatever.  In other words, why do we do the things <br>
we do with our lives?  It doesn't take too much imagination to see the <br>
implications of this question for extropian thinking - if we don't have any <br>
good reasons for doing what we now do in our currently limited lives, what <br>
makes us think an eternity-long existence will be any less pointless?   <br>
<p>
I'll bite right away - there is no good or rational reason for me to do any of <br>
the things I do today, at least not necessarily so.  My presence makes some <br>
people happy, so to them my continued existence is valuable.  With others <br>
perhaps the opposite is true.  The only thing I can answer with certainty is <br>
that my life, meaning all the things I do and strive for, is valuable and good <br>
to me.  I like it, otherwise I would end it right now.    <br>
	    <br>
I have stopped and thought about the question Alex raises, basically why do I <br>
bother to do things.  I've only come up with one good answer to this question: <br>
I do things for my own pleasure (and by pleasure I mean to inclued <br>
"happiness," contentment, joy, and anything else that I like).  <br>
<p>
My question to the group is this - has anyone else come up with something <br>
different?  I've searched a bit, analyzing all kinds of ethical philosophies <br>
and religions, and nothing else strkes me as a compelling answer to the "why" <br>
question.  Yes, it's all wonderfully pointless, amoral and devoid of higher <br>
purpose, this conscious life we have been given, but at least we can enjoy the <br>
ride.<br>
<p>
<p>
Any thoughts?  <br>
<p>
Chris   <br>
