<i>&gt;Geron also has a patent on a telomerase inhibitor. Except for</i><br>
<i>&gt;sperm and eggs most cells don't produce telomerase (some cells</i><br>
<i>&gt;lining the stomach and intestine produce a little, but not enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;to become immortal) so this inhibitor shouldn't have many side</i><br>
<i>&gt;effects, but all known cancers produce lots of it. Geron has a</i><br>
<i>&gt;sensitive method for detecting telomerase and hopes to use it to</i><br>
<i>&gt;diagnose cancer. The company also wants to develop its telomerase</i><br>
<i>&gt;inhibitor into a cancer treatment, if it works it would turn our</i><br>
<i>&gt;worst enemy into a friend, a fast growing cancer would die of old</i><br>
<i>&gt;age.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;On Tuesday when Geron made the announcement that they had made</i><br>
<i>&gt;human cells immortal its stock jumped up by 44%, does anybody have</i><br>
<i>&gt;an opinion about Geron as an investment?</i><br>
<p>
I think you make a pretty good case for it yourself, of course<br>
Geron isn't new to this list..... ;)<br>

<i>&gt;"Immortality" Gene Revealed</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Two teams of scientists-from Geron Corporation, the University of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Colorado at Boulder, and the Whitehead Institute for biomedical</i><br>
<i>&gt;research, among others-have cloned the gene for the human</i><br>
<i>&gt;telomerase catalytic protein, the "holy grail" of aging research.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This enzyme serves as a key of sorts for rewinding the celular</i><br>
<i>&gt;clock: cells that produce telemerase, such as cancer cells, are</i><br>
<i>&gt;immortal. Those that lack the enzyme have a limited life span. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;researchers hope that by having identified the enzyme, they will</i><br>
<i>&gt;be able to screen for drugs that can inhibit or activate it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Inhibitors might prove to be highly specific and potent anticancer</i><br>
<i>&gt;agents, where-as activators may well ameliorate diseases caused by</i><br>
<i>&gt;cell death, including Alzheimer's.</i><br>
