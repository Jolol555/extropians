I haven't read all posts on this topic, but in some of the early ones, the<br>
phrase "strong AI" was being used at odds with the accepted usage in<br>
philosophy of mind. There it means not more-than-human AI, but<br>
consciousness being achievable purely through software without having to<br>
worry about the particular physical instantiation. In that sense of "strong<br>
AI", I too have major doubts. I'm not at all convinced that a massive look<br>
up table would be conscious. I would not want to replace my brain with<br>
software based on a lookup table. In practice, I don't expect to have to<br>
worry about this, since I doubt it will be practicable to build a mind in<br>
such a manner.<br>
