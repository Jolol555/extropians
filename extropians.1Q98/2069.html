Today's WASHINGTON POST Health section focused on the role of <br>
hormones in longivity, the first time that they have devoted such a <br>
large section of newsprint to a life-extension topic.  The articles <br>
focused on DHEA, melatonin and growth hormones and include interviews <br>
with doctors who have begun to prescribe these to patients.  The <br>
attempt to move beyond the hyped claims of 'forever young' is <br>
laudable, but some of the criticism is aimed at serious efforts to <br>
utilize these substances to maintain levels of health.  The <br>
suggestion that one should have blood levels checked prior to <br>
beginning a regimen is dismissed as an unreasonable expectation that <br>
the patient should be taking some responsibility for obtaining health <br>
information. <br>
<p>
Some useful information appears, however, including the news of<br>
studies on fluasterone, similar to DHEA, that is not converted to<br>
testosterone or estrogen in the body.  The National Institute on<br>
Aging has given eight grants for the purpose of studying the role in<br>
growth hormones in the prevention of tissue degeneration in the<br>
elderly.  If these studies bear out, then the FDA may approve growth<br>
hormone treatment for the healthy elderly (at present, it is<br>
approved for use in AIDS patients).  Nevertheless, HGH Corporation<br>
reports that over 200 physicians have signed up for their program to<br>
supply growth hormone through several injections a week to their<br>
patients, at a cost of about %5,000 per year.<br>
