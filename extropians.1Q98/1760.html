                  C57BL/6J MICE LONGEVITY DATABASE<br>
             (Updated by Doug Skrecky February 11, 1998)<br>
<p>
   The following database lists the effect of various treatments on<br>
average life span of C57 black jax 6 (C57BL/6J) mice. The percent change<br>
in average life span is listed under the %CHANGE columns, relative to<br>
either the CONTROL group used in an individual experiment, or relative to<br>
the Longest Lived Control (LLC) group of all the experiments listed in<br>
this database. The LLC group was one of the control groups from reference<br>
20, which lived an average of 34.3 months. The START column shows the age<br>
when treatment was begun. A ~ symbol means that a number was estimated.<br>
   For animals that were calorically restricted, the amount of rat chow<br>
below ab libitum they were allowed to consume is indicated by the number<br>
before the word "chow". Thus -49% chow indicates that the animals were fed<br>
49% less chow, than they would normally consume. Some experiments which<br>
restricted calories by feeding animals only every other day did not<br>
clearly indicate the extent of the reduction. This is indicated by "EOD"<br>
chow. An interesting variant on caloric restriction is to be found in<br>
reference 19. Here the animals were allowed to eat ad libitum of a chow<br>
that was diluted by cellulose. Strictly speaking they were not<br>
"restricted", since the caloric intake was reduced voluntarily.<br>
   Some caloric restriction experiments fortified their chows so that<br>
restricted animals did not consume less protein, vitamins, and minerals<br>
than those fed ab libitum. This is indicated by the shorthand PR+, VIT+,<br>
and MIN+. Thus -49% chow PR+ VIT+ MIN+ means that 49% less chow (and<br>
calories) was consumed, but fortification with protein, vitamins, and<br>
minerals eliminated any potential confounding effects of multiple<br>
variations in the intake of these nutrients.<br>

SPECULATION:<br>
<p>
   An outstanding effort (reference 26) by a research group led by Akio<br>
Koizumi has finally elucidated the primary mechanism for the life span<br>
increases associated with caloric restriction in C57BL/6J mice. Unlike<br>
humans who suffer greatly from the vissitudes associated with<br>
cardiovascular disease, C57BL/6J mice die primarily of lymphoma cancer.<br>
Also unlike humans, these mice readily experience torpor, especially when<br>
calorically restricted. These reductions in body temperature can be<br>
prevented by housing the mice at 30 C. Doing this virtually eliminates<br>
both the anti-lymphoma effect of caloric restriction, and its associated<br>
life span increases. Stated otherwise, it is body temperature that is the<br>
key determinate of longevity in C57BL/6J mice. (Please note that in order<br>
to equalize body weights the mice housed at 30 C had to have their food<br>
ration slightly reduced: -66% versus -54%.)<br>
   The life span of the control groups varies widely, with the LLC group<br>
living longer than virtually all of the calorically restricted groups. It<br>
is apparent that calories are not the only factor influencing torpor. I<br>
speculate that small reductions in housing temperature while the animals<br>
are asleep may promote torpor, independantly of caloric intake.<br>
   It would be interesting to see the results of chemically blocking<br>
cancer development in C57BL/6J mice, by adding powerful anticarcinogens<br>
such as curcumin to mouse chow.<br>
