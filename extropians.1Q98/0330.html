Abraham Moses Genen wrote that we need an educational system "focused on<br>
an understanding that society functions best when placed ahead of the<br>
self."<br>
<p>
Actually, we need an educational system that teaches, among the other<br>
things he listed, that the self benefits greatly by helping other people.<br>
 Helping society IS helping oneself.  Helping other people is in one's<br>
own self-interest.  There really isn't much difference between<br>
intelligent selfishness and intelligent selflessness, as far as the<br>
results go.  Society is a symbiosis of humans; we all benefit from our<br>
intelligent cooperation with each other.  It's when people isolate<br>
themselves from others and refuse to help others that they are left to<br>
fend for themselves.  It's when people are only willing to participate in<br>
"official" transactions of service that they miss out on many benificial<br>
exchanges.  Working towards the "common good" is working towards one's<br>
own good as well.  There isn't really a division between individuals and<br>
society; a distinction, yes, but we're all in the same system.  There<br>
isn't really a division between individuals, either; in the center there<br>
is a distinct individual, but at the "edges", it all blurs together<br>
because so much of what we incorporate into the systems that we are have<br>
come from the systems that others are.<br>
<p>
A good educational system will teach humans how the world works and how<br>
to accomplish their goals within their world.  Learning how the world<br>
works involves observation and other forms of knowledge construction,<br>
such as critical thinking and reading or experiencing audio/visual<br>
materials.  Learning how to accomplish one's own goals involves the<br>
development of sufficient problem solving skills, which requires practice<br>
at solving a wide variety of type and complexity of problems.<br>
<p>
Someone who has developed within a good educational system should be<br>
strongly aware of their symbiotic relationship with other humans and with<br>
other organisms.  To accomplish their own goals, they will recognize the<br>
practicality of helping others accomplish their goals as well.  <br>
<p>
Developing a good edcuational system is one of the most extropian goals I<br>
can think of.<br>
