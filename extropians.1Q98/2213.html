A targeted disease would only work if the attacker has your genome, so<br>
that should be carefully protected.<br>

<p>
I can imagine some nanodefenses that would be effective against<br>
macroweapons. How about an exoskeleton made of cooperating nanomachines?<br>
It would block attacks when possible and move you out of harm's way when<br>
not. Such armor can reduce the kill radius of a nuclear bomb by protecting<br>
the occupant against thermal radiation and blast effects, and repairing<br>
damages from ionizing radiation.<br>
<p>
Nanotechnology can also help detect nuclear weapons by making sensors<br>
cheaper. Eventually every city will probably have a nuclear detector on<br>
every street corner.<br>
