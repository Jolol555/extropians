&lt; The sheer DENSITY of the historical record is<br>

without much insight the problems such a massive<br>
record will present to future historians.  Instead of<br>
the challenge historians of most eras of the human<br>
story have faced in the past, that of a too-small<br>
record requiring deductions and interpolations based<br>
on largely theoretical mental constructs, future<br>
historians will have the contrary problem of<br>
SELECTION from a perhaps too-rich record, requiring<br>
the guidance of actors at the time. &gt;<br>
<p>
In another recent thread, I mentioned my research<br>
into the movers and quakers of the 'Nation of<br>
Nantucket' (Nathaniel Philbrick's _Away Off Shore:<br>
Nantucket Island and Its People, 1602-1890_).  The<br>
interesting thing about Nantucket for this thread is<br>
that the people were mostly related to each other,<br>
and had been for almost 200 years (a condition that<br>
might also become very applicable to a society of<br>
Uploads, especially if cloning becomes popular). <br>
Each family (or "phyle") had to continue doing<br>
business with the others while knowing about some<br>
unsavory skeletons in their closets.  They had, of<br>
course, had their share of feuds and asset/liability<br>
disputes.  For example, during the American<br>
Revolutionary War, many Nantucketers were<br>
opportunistic smugglers and not always sympathetic to<br>
the American colonies' desire for independence.  This<br>
continued even through the War of 1812.<br>
<p>
By the 1830s, the feuds and allegations were<br>
threatening to tear the island's long-standing and<br>
unique social structure apart. In 1835, Joseph C.<br>
Hart wrote a 'novel' called _Mariam Coffin or the<br>
Whale-Fishermen_.  Most of the characters were<br>
historical persons, but various fictional licenses<br>
were taken - such as condensing the scope of history,<br>
merging several characters together, etc. <br>
Descendants of many of the historical persons<br>
collaborated with the author to produce a quasi-myth<br>
that romanticized some of the more unsavory elements<br>
while also spreading their ancestor's most virtuous<br>
legacies more evenly among the various families.<br>
<p>
The publication of Hart's novel helped to heal many<br>
of the rifts that had built up during some difficult<br>
historical periods.  It was also accompanied by the<br>
much more accurate, though still selective, _History<br>
of Nantucket_, co-authored by two elders of the<br>
warring factions. We see a similar sanitization and<br>
dramatization of history in recent movies such as<br>
Disney's "Pocahontas" and Spielberg's "Armistad".<br>
<p>
In a future of immortal 'persons', or 'teleological<br>
threads', especially in light of the deluge of<br>
historical data that will be accessible, a 'mythic'<br>
view of history might become even more widespread,<br>
especially for those who aren't scholars of history. <br>
(Though I suspect that endless genealogical and<br>
historical forums will also become an enduring<br>
entertainment industry for a society of immortals.)<br>
<p>
Still, in the situation I describe above, the ability<br>
to 'move on' flowed from the passing of older<br>
generations.  Perhaps, in an immortality milieu,<br>
eventual, if not constant, self-transformation will<br>
have to substitute for these generational tides.<br>
