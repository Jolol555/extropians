In a message dated 98-01-28 03:36:18 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Don't think of it as a cow, think of it as a "mobile cereal<br>
 compression/archive device." (one that happens to be mighty tasty if<br>
 you marinate it just right and then toss it onto the bbq :)  The food<br>
 problem you allude to is not one of production but of distribution.<br>
 It costs too much to move the grain to where it is needed.  We are<br>
 much better at growing food than we are at processing and<br>
 distributing it; we are so good at it that we have to pay people not<br>
 to grow food to prevent over-production.  All of those resources go<br>
 into producing meat because the animal converts the grain into a much<br>
 denser package which is easier to transport.  The conversion is not<br>
 even close to 100% efficient, but it is cheaper than piling the grain<br>
 up at the elevator and then watching it rot.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
isnt the reason the south american rainforests are getting burned is to make<br>
room for cows?   And they eat up the resources (fertilized soil from ash, to<br>
grow grazing grass) in a few years and then they have to burn more forest?<br>
