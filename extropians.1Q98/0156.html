It's my understanding that many of these species (the lobsters in <br>
particular) have since been shown to age, and the current theory <br>
holds that every animal ages if it lives long enough.  A long<br>
while back people thought that growth cessation was a necessary<br>
part of aging and hence animals that keep growing (fish, lobsters)<br>
didn't age.  <br>
