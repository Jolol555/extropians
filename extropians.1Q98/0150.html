In some ways, but complements and positive ways of putting things<br>
make people more receptive and more likely to deal with you.  It might<br>
be irrational but at present we're basically stuck with it.<br>
<p>
Since it's so difficult to distinguish friend from foe and assistance<br>
from covert interference, perhaps reacting more positively to those<br>
with good things to say about you works out in the cost-benefit<br>
analysis.  If so, politeness will get you ahead with a meta-rational<br>
actor, and a Red Queen chase will lead to the common situation of<br>
excessive politeness.<br>
