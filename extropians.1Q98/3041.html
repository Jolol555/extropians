Can someone tell me whether this is bogus interview?<br>
<p>
Obviously, it has all the makings of a hoax, but even if these are not<br>
Stroustrup's words, I think some of the points raised are valid(having<br>
wondered about the merits of C++ myself), and they are very important in<br>
determining whether the software industry may be burdened by entropic<br>
languages.<br>
<p>
I know there are lots of programmers on this list-- what do you think of<br>
the idea of a language putting a burden on expression? (maybe this question<br>
is also a linguistic/philsophical one... if everyone switched to Esperanto,<br>
would this increase the efficiency of communication?)<br>

-&gt;Stroustrup Confesses about C++<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;On the 1st of January, 1998, Bjarne Stroustrup gave an interview to<br>
the<br>
-&gt;IEEE's 'Computer' magazine.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Naturally, the editors thought he would be giving a retrospective view<br>
-&gt;of seven years of object-oriented design, using the language he<br>
created.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;By the end of the interview, the interviewer got more than he had<br>
-&gt;bargained for and, subsequently, the editor decided to suppress its<br>
-&gt;contents, 'for the good of the industry' but, as with many of these<br>
-&gt;things, there was a leak.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Here is a complete transcript of what was said, unedited, and<br>
-&gt;unrehearsed, so it isn't as neat as planned interviews.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;You will find it interesting...<br>
-&gt;__________________________________________________________________<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Well, it's been a few years since you changed the<br>
-&gt;               world of software design.  How does it feel,<br>
-&gt;               looking back?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Actually, I was thinking about those days, just<br>
-&gt;               before you arrived.  Do you remember?  Everyone<br>
-&gt;               was writing 'C' and, the trouble was, they were<br>
-&gt;               pretty damn good at it.  Universities got pretty<br>
-&gt;               good at teaching it, too.  They were turning out<br>
-&gt;               competent - I stress the word 'competent' -<br>
-&gt;               graduates at a phenomenal rate.  That's what<br>
-&gt;               caused the problem.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Problem?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Yes, problem.  Remember when everyone wrote<br>
-&gt;               COBOL?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Of course, I did, too.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Well, in the beginning, these guys were like<br>
-&gt;               demi-gods.  Their salaries were high, and they<br>
-&gt;               were treated like royalty.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Those were the days, eh?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Right.  So what happened?  IBM got sick of it,<br>
-&gt;               and invested millions in training programmers,<br>
-&gt;               till they were a dime a dozen.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   That's why I got out.  Salaries dropped within a<br>
-&gt;               year, to the point where being a journalist<br>
-&gt;               actually paid better.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Exactly.  Well, the same happened with 'C'<br>
-&gt;               programmers.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   I see, but what's the point?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Well, one day, when I was sitting in my office, I<br>
-&gt;               thought of this little scheme, which would<br>
-&gt;               redress the balance a little.  I thought 'I<br>
-&gt;               wonder what would happen, if there were a<br>
-&gt;               language so complicated, so difficult to learn,<br>
-&gt;               that nobody would ever be able to swamp the<br>
-&gt;               market with programmers?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;               Actually, I got some of the ideas from X10, you<br>
-&gt;               know, X windows.  That was such a bitch of a<br>
-&gt;               graphics system, that it only just ran on those<br>
-&gt;               Sun 3/60 things.  They had all the ingredients<br>
-&gt;               for what I wanted.  A really ridiculously complex<br>
-&gt;               syntax, obscure functions, and pseudo-OO<br>
-&gt;               structure.  Even now, nobody writes raw X-windows<br>
-&gt;               code.  Motif is the only way to go if you want to<br>
-&gt;               retain your sanity.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   You're kidding...?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Not a bit of it.  In fact, there was another<br>
-&gt;               problem.  Unix was written in 'C', which meant<br>
-&gt;               that any 'C' programmer could very easily become<br>
-&gt;               a systems programmer.  Remember what a mainframe<br>
-&gt;               systems programmer used to earn?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   You bet I do, that's what I used to do.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    OK, so this new language had to divorce itself<br>
-&gt;               from Unix, by hiding all the system calls that<br>
-&gt;               bound the two together so nicely.  This would<br>
-&gt;               enable guys who only knew about DOS to earn a<br>
-&gt;               decent living too.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   I don't believe you said that...<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Well, it's been long enough, now, and I believe<br>
-&gt;               most people have figured out for themselves that<br>
-&gt;               C++ is a waste of time but, I must say, it's<br>
-&gt;               taken them a lot longer than I thought it would.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   So how exactly did you do it?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    It was only supposed to be a joke, I never<br>
-&gt;               thought people would take the book seriously.<br>
-&gt;               Anyone with half a brain can see that<br>
-&gt;               object-oriented programming is counter-intuitive,<br>
-&gt;               illogical and inefficient.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   What?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    And as for 're-useable code' --- when did you<br>
-&gt;               ever hear of a company re-using its code?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Well, never, actually, but...<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    There you are then.  Mind you, a few tried, in the<br>
-&gt;               early days.  There was this Oregon company ---<br>
-&gt;               Mentor Graphics, I think they were called --- really<br>
-&gt;               caught a cold trying to rewrite everything in C++<br>
-&gt;               in about '90 or '91.  I felt sorry for them<br>
-&gt;               really, but I thought people would learn from<br>
-&gt;               their mistakes.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Obviously, they didn't?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Not in the slightest.  Trouble is, most companies<br>
-&gt;               hush-up all their major blunders, and explaining<br>
-&gt;               a $30 million loss to the shareholders would have<br>
-&gt;               been difficult.  Give them their due, though,<br>
-&gt;               they made it work in the end.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   They did?  Well, there you are then, it proves<br>
-&gt;               O-O works.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Well, almost.  The executable was so huge, it<br>
-&gt;               took five minutes to load, on an HP workstation,<br>
-&gt;               with 128MB of RAM.  Then it ran like molasses.<br>
-&gt;               Actually, I thought this would be a major<br>
-&gt;               stumbling-block, and I'd get found out within a<br>
-&gt;               week, but nobody cared.  Sun and HP were only too<br>
-&gt;               glad to sell enormously powerful boxes, with huge<br>
-&gt;               resources just to run trivial programs.  You know,<br>
-&gt;               when we had our first C++ compiler, at AT&amp;T, I<br>
-&gt;               compiled 'Hello World', and couldn't believe the<br>
-&gt;               size of the executable. 2.1MB<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   What?  Well, compilers have come a long way,<br>
-&gt;               since then.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    They have?  Try it on the latest version of C++ -<br>
-&gt;               you won't get much change out of half a megabyte.<br>
-&gt;               Also, there are several quite recent examples for<br>
-&gt;               you, from all over the world.  British Telecom<br>
-&gt;               had a major disaster on their hands but, luckily,<br>
-&gt;               managed to scrap the whole thing and start again.<br>
-&gt;               They were luckier than Australian Telecom.  Now I<br>
-&gt;               hear that Siemens is building a dinosaur, and<br>
-&gt;               getting more and more worried as the size of the<br>
-&gt;               hardware gets bigger, to accommodate the<br>
-&gt;               executables.  Isn't multiple inheritance a joy?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Yes, but C++ is basically a sound language.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    You really believe that, don't you?  Have you<br>
-&gt;               ever sat down and worked on a C++ project?<br>
-&gt;               Here's what happens:    First, I've put in enough<br>
-&gt;               pitfalls to make sure that only the most trivial<br>
-&gt;               projects will work first time.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;               Take operator overloading.  At the end of the<br>
-&gt;               project, almost every module has it, usually,<br>
-&gt;               because guys feel they really should do it, as it<br>
-&gt;               was in their training course.  The same operator<br>
-&gt;               then means something totally different in every<br>
-&gt;               module.  Try pulling that lot together, when you<br>
-&gt;               have a hundred or so modules.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;               And as for data hiding, God, I sometimes can't<br>
-&gt;               help laughing when I hear about the problems<br>
-&gt;               companies have making their modules talk to each<br>
-&gt;               other.  I think the word 'synergistic' was<br>
-&gt;               specially invented to twist the knife in a<br>
-&gt;               project manager's ribs.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   I have to say, I'm beginning to be quite appalled<br>
-&gt;               at all this.  You say you did it to raise<br>
-&gt;               programmers' salaries?  That's obscene.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Not really.  Everyone has a choice.  I didn't<br>
-&gt;               expect the thing to get so much out of hand.<br>
-&gt;               Anyway, I basically succeeded.  C++ is dying off<br>
-&gt;               now, but programmers still get high salaries -<br>
-&gt;               especially those poor devils who have to maintain<br>
-&gt;               all this crap.  You do realise, it's impossible<br>
-&gt;               to maintain a large C++ software module if you<br>
-&gt;               didn't actually write it?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   How come?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    You are out of touch, aren't you?  Remember the<br>
-&gt;               typedef?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Yes, of course.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Remember how long it took to grope through the<br>
-&gt;               header files only to find that 'RoofRaised' was a<br>
-&gt;               double precision number?  Well, imagine how long<br>
-&gt;               it takes to find all the implicit typedefs in all<br>
-&gt;               the Classes in a major project.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   So how do you reckon you've succeeded?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    The universities haven't been teaching 'C' for<br>
-&gt;               such a long time, there's now a shortage of<br>
-&gt;               decent 'C' programmers.  Especially those who<br>
-&gt;               know anything about Unix systems programming.<br>
-&gt;               How many guys would know what to do with<br>
-&gt;               'malloc', when they've used 'new' all these years<br>
-&gt;               - and never bothered to check the return code.<br>
-&gt;               In fact, most C++ programmers throw away their<br>
-&gt;               return codes.  Whatever happened to good ol'<br>
-&gt;               '-1'?  At least you knew you had an error,<br>
-&gt;               without bogging the thing down in all that<br>
-&gt;               'throw' 'catch' 'try' stuff.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   But, surely, inheritance does save a lot of time?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Does it?  Have you ever noticed the difference<br>
-&gt;               between a 'C' project plan, and a C++ project<br>
-&gt;               plan?  The planning stage for a C++ project is<br>
-&gt;               three times as long.  Precisely to make sure that<br>
-&gt;               everything which should be inherited is, and what<br>
-&gt;               shouldn't isn't.  Then, they still get it wrong.<br>
-&gt;               Whoever heard of memory leaks in a 'C' program?<br>
-&gt;               Now finding them is a major industry.  Most<br>
-&gt;               companies give up, and send the product out,<br>
-&gt;               knowing it leaks like a sieve, simply to avoid<br>
-&gt;               the expense of tracking them all down.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   There are tools....<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Most of which were written in C++.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   If we publish this, you'll probably get lynched,<br>
-&gt;               you do realise that?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    I doubt it.  As I said, C++ is way past its peak<br>
-&gt;               now, and no company in its right mind would start<br>
-&gt;               a C++ project without a pilot trial.  That should<br>
-&gt;               convince them that it's the road to disaster.  If<br>
-&gt;               not, they deserve all they get.  You know, I<br>
-&gt;               tried to convince Dennis Ritchie to rewrite Unix<br>
-&gt;               in C++.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Oh my God.  What did he say?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Well, luckily, he has a good sense of humor.  I<br>
-&gt;               think both he and Brian figured out what I was<br>
-&gt;               doing, in the early days, but never let on.  He<br>
-&gt;               said he'd help me write a C++ version of DOS, if<br>
-&gt;               I was interested.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Were you?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Actually, I did write DOS in C++, I'll give you a<br>
-&gt;               demo when we're through.  I have it running on a<br>
-&gt;               Sparc 20 in the computer room.  Goes like a<br>
-&gt;               rocket on 4 CPU's, and only takes up 70 megs of<br>
-&gt;               disk.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   What's it like on a PC?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Now you're kidding.  Haven't you ever seen<br>
-&gt;               Windows '95?  I think of that as my biggest<br>
-&gt;               success.  Nearly blew the game before I was<br>
-&gt;               ready, though.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   You know, that idea of a Unix++ has really got me<br>
-&gt;               thinking.  Somewhere out there, there's a guy<br>
-&gt;               going to try it.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Not after they read this interview.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   I'm sorry, but I don't see us being able to<br>
-&gt;               publish any of this.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    But it's the story of the century.  I only want<br>
-&gt;               to be remembered by my fellow programmers, for<br>
-&gt;               what I've done for them.  You know how much a C++<br>
-&gt;               guy can get these days?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Last I heard, a really top guy is worth $70 - $80<br>
-&gt;               an hour.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    See?  And I bet he earns it.  Keeping track of<br>
-&gt;               all the gotchas I put into C++ is no easy job.<br>
-&gt;               And, as I said before, every C++ programmer feels<br>
-&gt;               bound by some mystic promise to use every damn<br>
-&gt;               element of the language on every project.<br>
-&gt;               Actually, that really annoys me sometimes, even<br>
-&gt;               though it serves my original purpose.  I almost<br>
-&gt;               like the language after all this time.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   You mean you didn't before?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Hated it.  It even looks clumsy, don't you agree?<br>
-&gt;               But when the book royalties started to come in...<br>
-&gt;               well, you get the picture.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Just a minute.  What about references?  You must<br>
-&gt;               admit, you improved on 'C' pointers.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Hmm.  I've always wondered about that.<br>
-&gt;               Originally, I thought I had.  Then, one day I was<br>
-&gt;               discussing this with a guy who'd written C++ from<br>
-&gt;               the beginning.  He said he could never remember<br>
-&gt;               whether his variables were referenced or<br>
-&gt;               dereferenced, so he always used pointers.  He said<br>
-&gt;               the little asterisk always reminded him.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   Well, at this point, I usually say 'thank you<br>
-&gt;               very much' but it hardly seems adequate.<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Promise me you'll publish this.  My conscience is<br>
-&gt;               getting the better of me these days.<br>
-&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;-Interviewer:   I'll let you know, but I think I know what my</i><br>
<i>&gt;-               editor will say.</i><br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Stroustrup:    Who'd believe it anyway?  Although, can you send<br>
-&gt;               me a copy of that tape?<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;Interviewer:   I can do that.<br>
