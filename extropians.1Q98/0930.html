 it causes another paradox. If we look at a galaxy 15 billion <br>

I think the purported puzzel (this is the so-called horizon problem) <br>
is not so much that the laws of physics are the same in causally <br>
unconnected parts of the universe, but rather that these different <br>
parts are in thermal equilibrium -- that the matter configuration and <br>
the cosmic background radiation look roughly the same in all <br>
directions.<br>
