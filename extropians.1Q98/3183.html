You have to be careful in interpreting information about the Y2K problem.<br>
Many of the people sounding the alarm are selling Y2K services or books,<br>
so they have a vested interest in making it sound bad.  Others are<br>
die-hard survivalists for whom this is the latest issue to justify the<br>
same predictions of disaster they've been making for years.<br>
<p>
Ed Yourdon's book, Time Bomb 2000, gives a good overview of the potential<br>
problems.  He has a web site at <a href="http://www.yourdon.com/index.htm">http://www.yourdon.com/index.htm</a> which<br>
includes discussion forums, although they are dominated by disasterists.<br>
Gary North is one of the pre-eminent apocalyptics, with lots of up to date<br>
information at <a href="http://www.garynorth.com">http://www.garynorth.com</a>.  However North is a Christian<br>
fundamentalist who believes for religious reasons that the world will<br>
come to an end at the millennium.<br>
<p>
Just because the field is dominated by nut cases and people who benefit<br>
from predictions of disaster doesn't mean that there's no problem, of<br>
course.  To believe that is to fall into the ad hominen fallacy.<br>
<p>
A less biased source of information is at the Computer Professionals<br>
for Social Responsibility web site, <a href="http://www.cpsr.org/program/y2k/">http://www.cpsr.org/program/y2k/</a>.<br>
They have a working group on the Y2K problem, including "rumor central"<br>
which includes various predictions with estimates of how reliable they<br>
are.  However the site doesn't seem to have been updated recently.<br>
<p>
The problem is that there is very little hard information available<br>
to judge the extent of the problem.  The problem is widespread, with<br>
many different manifestations, each of which is being dealt with in<br>
different ways.  It's like an inkblot test, where what people see in<br>
it depends more on their predispositions than the available data.<br>
<p>
It could be the worst disaster ever to hit western civilization, the end<br>
of the world as we know it, with all of our infrastructure crashing -<br>
no communications, no power, no transportation, no food.  Or it could<br>
be no more than an annoying, expensive nuisance, with some localized<br>
disruptions in the early part of the year 2000, gradually being fixed<br>
and coming under control.<br>
<p>
Broadly speaking, the problem can be technically divided into three<br>
categories:<br>
<p>
 - Mainframes, the big old computers running old programs written in Cobol,<br>
   PL/1, and other old-fashioned programming languages.<br>
<p>
 - Personal computers, where the operating systems and/or applications<br>
   may not be Y2K compliant, and which may also have custom spreadsheets<br>
   and database programs which can have Y2K bugs of their own.<br>
<p>
 - Embedded systems, the microprocessor chips which are nearly universal<br>
   in industrial control today.<br>
<p>
Each of these has their own vulnerabilities and their own requirements for<br>
analysis and repair.<br>
<p>
You can then break it down crosswise into sectors: government, industry,<br>
consumer goods, transportation, communication, power, etc.  To understand<br>
the extent of the danger, you've got to look at each entry in the resulting<br>
matrix and try to judge what is likely to happen, and how bad things will<br>
be as a result.  It's a big, messy problem, with no easy answers.<br>
<p>
Apart from the severity of the Y2K problem itself is the danger posed by<br>
panic as we approach 2000.  We could see bank runs, stock market collapse,<br>
hoarding and other problems if people get scared.  This will depend on<br>
how the media spins it, and since disasters sell more papers than good<br>
news, I suspect things are going to be pretty rough in late 1999.<br>
