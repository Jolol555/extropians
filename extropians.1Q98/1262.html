<i>&gt; From:          "Geoff Smith" &lt;geoffs@unixg.ubc.ca&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Could someone please give me some good examples of how private scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; research is "better"(interpret that as you will) than public research.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am presently involved in a debate with my university peers and professors,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I need some more ammunition.</i><br>
<p>
Private research is inherently better in that it is not funded by <br>
wealth taken by force from people who think the research is <br>
undesirable, unnecessary, or even just not the best use of the wealth <br>
at that time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The following e-mail is an example a response against my argument.  I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguing in  particular that private research is better, and that only</i><br>
<i>&gt; private universities should have tenure, since researchers at public</i><br>
<i>&gt; universities should be held accountable to the public.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks a lot,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Geoff.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (ps. feel free to aim your arguments specifically at the e-mail below...)</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Dear Sci-Oners, SOSers, et al,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Let me `wet my oars' this Science Week with four brief comments in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; support of unfettered pure research in the continuing debate about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Point 1. The laser was not `invented' from the need for new surgical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; instruments, nor the nanotube from the need of new fibres, nor radar</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; from the need to detect enemy aircraft, nor the chip for the purpose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of miniaturization, nor, nor, .....</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Most fundamental advances have emerged from `pure' curiosity-driven</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; research, not from goal-directed pursuits. The rapid publication of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unfettered research in the open literature leads to its free use for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technological development by business, industry, government or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; individual entrepreneurs.</i><br>
<p>
And this relates how to any claim that coercively-funded research is <br>
better, or even as good?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Point 2. The Private Sector is inefficient at producing basic advances</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; because of the proprietary secrecy and patenting which accompanies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it.</i><br>
<p>
The public sector is inefficient at producing basic advances because <br>
it will tend to become clogged by scientific bureaucrats (some of <br>
whom might originally have been scientists) more interested in <br>
drawing out a project (job security) than in delivering results.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; This secrecy leads to considerable duplication of research effort</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; across an industry, such as pharmaceuticals.</i><br>
<p>
Duplication in research is essential to science.  It is, among other <br>
things, how you check the validity of results.  And just how much <br>
secrecy is there, really?  I seem to see a *lot* of medical-journal <br>
articles, many of them from privately-funded researchers -- and this <br>
is somewhat surprising because I don't read medical journals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is because such research</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is not openly published for all to take advantage of, that I think such</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; research has no place at a university. [Suppose the laser had been</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; invented by Laser Corporation: they would have kept silent about it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; until all THEIR ideas were patented, and we would have missed-out on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; most of the developments of the laser these past 38 years.]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 3. Industry tends to be short on altruism: the CEO of a major</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; automobile manufacturer said recently, "we are not here to make cars</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or employ people, but simply to make money for our shareholders,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; whatever it takes". And just this week, MacBlo closed its R &amp; D</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; centre in Burnaby because of short-term bottom-line myopia.</i><br>
<p>
Stupidity certainly occurs in private enterprise.  Fortunately, we <br>
all know that government is immune to stupidity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 4. We, the public, pay for Government operations through `tax'</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; dollars and for the Private Sector with `after-tax' dollars (as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; consumers). Why do we seem to get so hot under the collar about a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; dollars spent by governments on pure research at universities, while</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; shrugging our shoulders at the excesses and extravagances of major</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; businesses and industries -- whose costs we absorb on the ticket of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; items such as food, housing, travel, hair-dying and E-mailing.</i><br>
<p>
Why precisely would you object to the burglar who steals your $500 <br>
TV, while not trying to make a criminal case out of your mortgage <br>
payment?<br>
