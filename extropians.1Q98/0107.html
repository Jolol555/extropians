It sounds nice, but those who expect equal justice have always been <br>
disappointed and always will be because nothing is free and some law is more <br>
expensive than others. If that's the sort of law you want then you're going <br>
to have to and bid against others who want something different. In the real <br>
world compromises must be made, nobody is powerful enough to have exactly the <br>
law they want and priorities must be set. Personally stopping any unfair<br>
advantages I might have would be dead last on my list of priorities, I don't <br>
think I'm very strange in that regard but your mileage may vary. Nevertheless <br>
the question remains, just how much money would you really be willing to <br>
shell out to ensure that you were treated not one bit better than somebody <br>
who didn't spend a dime? <br>
