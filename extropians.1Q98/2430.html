<i> &gt;Max More wrote 3/3/98: &lt;I should know better than to get involved in an</i><br>

<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I, too, should know better.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe we all should but I'm curious as to the logic behind this viewpoint<br>
(and mutual understanding often prevent further conflict).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;No, I'm reasonable, it's non-consensual for the woman and illicitly rewards</i><br>
<i> &gt;the rapist within the gene pool. I don't think that jurisdictions who</i><br>
<i> &gt;allow this will slip into the culture of death. A child forced on a woman</i><br>
<i> &gt;is tragic and so is that child's legalized murder.</i><br>
<p>
So then _practically_ any woman who want an abortion just says she was<br>
raped. Who can check? If allowing abortions in the case of rape is<br>
acceptable then _in practice_ abortion is legal because when a woman claims<br>
she's been raped the doctors will have to take her word for it (the fact<br>
that she did not go to the police or something doesn't prove anything, a<br>
situation could arise where she not willing to press charges).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;I just won't</i><br>
<i> &gt;grant that anything purely digital could ever be conscious, consciousness</i><br>
<i> &gt;must access the entire universe, not just 50% of it.</i><br>
<p>
This I find a most amazing viewpoint. Please explain 'cause I'm lost.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;&lt;In this case, you are doing damage to the person who will exist. In the</i><br>
<i> &gt;case of abortion, you are preventing a person from coming into existence.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;As I said above, these discussions rapidly get to an obstinate stand on</i><br>
<i> &gt;definitions. "Preventing a person from coming into existence" is a</i><br>
<i> &gt;definitional stance unconnected with reality.</i><br>
<p>
Now you are forcing your definition of what a human being is on us. Since<br>
we did not agree a fertilized egg is a human we haven't agreed on what<br>
'reality' is.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The reality is the person in</i><br>
<i> &gt;question has been in existence since conception and that what you call</i><br>
<i> &gt;"prevention" is actually murder.</i><br>
<p>
Again, hold it! that's your reality. A 2 week old fetus is not a person in<br>
my book, it has the potential of becoming a person. Just like a highschool<br>
student has the potential of becoming a scientist.<br>
<p>
What's so special anyway about the moment of conception that a 'person'<br>
begins to exist there? I'll grant that is't a convienently clear and<br>
_measurable_ event in a long sequence but it still just an event in a<br>
series of events.<br>
<p>
I don't claim to know what the definition of a human is but I'm pretty sure<br>
you and I are human. I'm pretty sure a 1 year-old baby is a human. I'm also<br>
pretty sure that a 4 week old fetus is not yet a human. I fully realize<br>
this is a mess from a philosophical standpoint, but then, so is real life.<br>
It seems to be broadly accepted (in Europe anyway) and makes for a<br>
_workable_ rule.<br>
<p>
If definitions cannot be implemented in practical, real-world rules or laws<br>
they're not worth the bits they're written with (IMHO).<br>
<p>
Respectfully,<br>
Arjen Kamphuis<br>
