An appropriate parody might be: boundaryism is more likely the "Truth"<br>
because it doesn't impose an artificial sameness on a heterogen(e)ous<br>
universe.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;I find this whole line of thinking to be unconvincing. Centuries of</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Why should we think that holism is more real than boundaryism?</i><br>

You are missing the point, if I read Brian right, he objects not to <br>
your *choice* of primal truth, but to your claim of priority for one <br>
end of the axis - it doesn't matter which end.<br>
<p>
As for me, I think you confuse description ("Tom Thumb is the<br>
shortest man in the world") with identity.<br>
