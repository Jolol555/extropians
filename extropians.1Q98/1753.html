<i>&gt; I think the most important area of focus when improving my senses was </i><br>
<i>&gt; learning to pay conscious attention to so much information.  And one</i><br>
big<br>
<i>&gt; key to doing that was learning to be interested in vast amounts of </i><br>
<i>&gt; information which doesn't really matter.  Most sensory information</i><br>
didn't <br>
<i>&gt; really matter to me, so I ignored it, but when I determined to pay</i><br>
attention <br>
<i>&gt; to as much as I could, my sensory world really started opening up,</i><br>
and <br>
<i>&gt; ordinary things became fascinating delights.  I eventually learned</i><br>
to see <br>
<i>&gt; and appreciate so much beauty in my world that I simply overlooked</i><br>
before <br>
<i>&gt; because I didn't think it mattered.  Now there's so much vivid</i><br>
detail in <br>
<i>&gt; everything, even the most common-place things seem interesting.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.  My greatest advantage is my ability to deal with complexity.<br>
 I just let all the information flow in and then decide whether it’s<br>
useful or not.  My senses have always been more heightened than the<br>
average person has, and so it was the logical step to use this ability<br>
in the same way you describe.  I think the major difference in the way<br>
that I process information is that it “flows” in, I don’t have to pick<br>
it out.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; As I focused on my senses, my intellect gradually gained new thinking </i><br>
<i>&gt; styles that were more related to interpreting and analyzing the</i><br>
sensory <br>
<i>&gt; world.  My thinking became much more dynamic, detailed and powerful</i><br>
(it <br>
<i>&gt; also became more multi-tasking, switching among several lines of</i><br>
thinking, <br>
<i>&gt; rather than focusing on one until it was done).</i><br>
<p>
I think I can safely say my style of thinking is very different<br>
without anyone disputing that claim.  I also started to find much more<br>
detail in the world.  It’s as simple as “reading between the lines”<br>
there’s so much to be found when you open your mind.  This doesn’t<br>
mean I’ll accept any idea that comes along, but it does mean I’ll<br>
consider them.  And although many list members complain about having<br>
their time wasted by pointless information, for me the rational<br>
criticism of such information has become an instant reaction and does<br>
not consume much time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's been very rewarding for me to see the vast improvement I've </i><br>
<i>&gt; experienced in my senses over the past few years; rewarding because</i><br>
now <br>
<i>&gt; things look, sound, feel, taste and smell so fascinating and</i><br>
beautiful, and <br>
<i>&gt; rewarding because I was able to pursue my goal of modifying myself in </i><br>
<i>&gt; that way and succeed.  </i><br>
<p>
It’s a great feeling.  For me the greatest achievement has been the<br>
shear speed increase.  For instance, while programming I can solve<br>
problems faster than I can type them – which can become very<br>
frustrating.  The information flow out of my mind is much faster than<br>
I can explain it by talking or writing.  And the amount of<br>
multitasking I can achieve at any one time means I now work in a<br>
decidedly non-linear fashion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As my senses became very good, I realized that I could probably</i><br>
improve <br>
<i>&gt; my thinking even more by learning to pay more attention to cognitive </i><br>
<i>&gt; information.  This has proved to be more difficult and elusive than</i><br>
paying <br>
<i>&gt; attention to sensory information, but I persist in working on it,</i><br>
and I am <br>
<i>&gt; making some improvements.  </i><br>
<p>
I can currently – visualise and control the flow of information in my<br>
mind, control the creation of motivational/emotional links, and what I<br>
can only describe as “feel” ideas forming.  The weirdest experiences<br>
I’ve had are having emotional reactions to *very* traumatic situations<br>
which, when I “paid attention” to them, I found I could control just<br>
as easily as any limb on my body.  This isn’t ‘suppressing’ emotion,<br>
but understanding the route cause and controlling it.  As I said<br>
before, finding these causes can take along time.  And as I briefly<br>
mentioned, changing emotional/motivational constructs can be<br>
dangerous.  I experience a brief period of intense negativity, which<br>
can only be described as – the scenes in “Millennium” where you see<br>
flashing of images of what the killer is planning for his victim. <br>
Walking down the road and seeing grotesque portraits of passers-by<br>
isn’t the greatest feeling in the world (although at the time it did<br>
have a certain appeal.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have come to believe that attention is a big key to improving</i><br>
oneself.  It's <br>
<i>&gt; basically a way of getting feedback, and without feedback, directed</i><br>
change <br>
<i>&gt; approaches impossibility.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think it would be useful for list members to discuss the effective</i><br>
ways <br>
<i>&gt; they have discovered for improving various aspects of themselves.</i><br>
<p>
I actually have a “method” for the cognitive changes, which involves<br>
searching your mind for different constructs, assessing them, and<br>
changing them.  Changing them is the part I can’t describe – I’ve<br>
become so use to altering my mind state that I can’t describe the way<br>
I actually do it.<br>
<p>
Lately I haven’t been so active in these changes, but I’m now<br>
considering using some more aggressive techniques to invoke further<br>
change.<br>
<p>
BTW, if you’re wondering what I changed when altering the<br>
emotional/motivational part of my mind.  I tried to switch most of<br>
them off, unfortunately we seem to keep the more negative ones deeper<br>
set in our minds (perhaps due to suppression) and that is what I think<br>
caused the problems (either that or I’m a psychopath at heart.)  The<br>
reason I wanted them ‘switched off’ was because you get a greater<br>
speed advantage when the safety’s off!<br>
