<i>&gt; of such</i><br>

<i>&gt; which, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;his credit, he freed after his death) and he wasn't a pure libertarian, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; the man</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;had mostly good principles and a lot of courage. Contrast William Jefferson</i><br>
<i>&gt; (I gag</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;associating him with our 3rd President) Clinton. </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I disagree on the one-third-of-the-populace-behind-them argument.  I think you</i><br>
<i>&gt; need much less, but you also must be certain that the rest of the people are</i><br>
<i>&gt; less</i><br>
<i>&gt; united and don't care.  In other words, if 10% of the people support you and</i><br>
<i>&gt; have</i><br>
<i>&gt; the will and dough while the rest have neither and don't care, I think you'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; good chance.  The problem is that today most people who contemplate revolution</i><br>
<i>&gt; are not the sort of people I'd like to see succeed.  In fact, they look a</i><br>
<i>&gt; little too much</i><br>
<i>&gt; like the current rulers!  (Recall Timothy McVeigh was a decorated veteran of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Persian Gulf War.)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I think you are probably right.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; In real life, I'd rather see a revolution of the peaceful sort, especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; of changing</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough people over to our side.  And keep others neutral.  Someone once said,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not everyone needed to be enlightened during the Enlightenment, and look what</i><br>
<i>&gt; came from that.  (Can you tell me who said this?:)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I really don't look forward to another Civil War. And, with the exception <br>
of the American Revolution, almost all wars lead to a massive decrease in <br>
freedom.<br>
<p>
I can't tell you the source of your quote. :-(<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; But my original point was that there is a difference between morality and</i><br>
<i>&gt; legality --</i><br>
<i>&gt; or what is right and wrong and what should be up to the law -- whether enforced</i><br>
<i>&gt; by a government or what have you -- to decide.  Does anyone agree with me</i><br>
<i>&gt; on this?</i><br>
<p>
The government, if it exists, should only enforce laws to protect people's <br>
liberty and property and make sure contracts are enforced. However, under our <br>
current legal system, acts which are not immoral, like taking drugs are <br>
criminalized, while theft by the government (taxation), certainly immoral, is <br>
quite legal. Ideally, everything immoral should be illegal, and everything moral <br>
should be legal. I am however, speaking of rational morality, not the often <br>
idiotic kind advanced by religion. <br>
<p>
For an example of immorality posing as morality, see the truly vile piece by Dr. <br>
Sally Satel (an evil psychiatrist) in today's Wall Street Journal advocating <br>
using coercion against drug users "for their own good." It's a shame this Nazi <br>
bitch is given space in one of our leading newspapers, but the WSJ is run by a <br>
bunch of superstitious religious conservatives who have no idea of the real <br>
meaning of freedom. <br>
