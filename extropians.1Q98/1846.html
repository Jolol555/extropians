In this case, his extramarital affairs ARE my business, since Bill has made the<br>
support of anti-smut legislation part of his campaigns. If he set the moral<br>
standard as the occupier of the bully pulpit, we can only expect him to practice<br>
what he preaches. If he doesn't, to our detriment, then it is our right to take him<br>
to task.<br>
