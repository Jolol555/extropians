Actually, a far better explanation for this phenomenon lies in the <br>
dynamics of parliamentary systems as compared to an <br>
independent-executive system, and the dynamics of proportional <br>
representation versus district-level winner-take-all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From my limited exposure to European politics it appears that in most </i><br>
European nations about 2/3 of politicians -- and of <br>
voters -- are part of two near-permanent coalitions, with about half <br>
the balance being a swing group between these two coalitions and the <br>
other half being "fringe".  The executive is usually either a <br>
relatively centrist member of a party that a permanent coalition <br>
member, or one of the larger swing parties.  This is independent of <br>
the number of parties involved, and isn't really that much different <br>
from the US political situation except we don't label the politicians <br>
in the swing group as separate parties.<br>
