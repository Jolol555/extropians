<i>&gt; Yet the chimpanzee, contrary to the claims of liberally blindered researchers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been shown to prefer meat as a food source. Even Dr. Goodall has confirmed</i><br>
<i>&gt; this. Since chimps are our closest existing relatives, I think that what some</i><br>
<i>&gt; fruit sucking lemur does is a little less relevant. Better yet is what</i><br>
<i>&gt; paleontologists find out about our ancestors like Home Heidelbergensis, Homo</i><br>
<i>&gt; Antecessor,, or Proto-Homo Sapiens preferred for a diet.</i><br>

Yeah, and rats will starve themselves to death given a choice between an<br>
endless supply of cocaine or food.<br>

To maximize your chance of making it to the singularity, the<br>
transcension, or whatever, you really shouldn't eat meat. Not only is<br>
the fat bad for you, but the amino acid composition of meat is unhealthy<br>
( e.g. too much methionine, which increases plasma homocysteine levels,<br>
a risk factor for heart attack).<br>

Practically nobody with a blood cholesterol level below 140 ng/dl ever<br>
gets cardiovascular disease, the number one killer in the western world.<br>
The only way to reach this low level for most people is to consume _no_<br>
cholesterol in the diet. This means eating _no_ animal products. Such a<br>
diet also greatly reduces your chances of developing a lot of cancers,<br>
the number two killer in the western world.<br>
