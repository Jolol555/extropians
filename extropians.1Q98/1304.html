Aksherly, there's quite a bit of developmental evidence that the whole<br>
reason hemp produces THC and related compounds is because ungulents<br>
(like cows) _hate_ the stuff.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, hemp is farmed in the EU; it's not hard to breed a<br>
strain of cannabis sativa that produces no intoxicating substances<br>
whatsoever. (Although the cops tend to keep a close eye on farmers who<br>
have a license to grow the stuff, just to make sure it's an approved<br>
strain ...)<br>
