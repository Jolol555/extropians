Hi!<br>

My theory is that some species never aged (in a evolutionary scale)<br>
while others started to show signs of aging and then "evolved" towards<br>
non-aging species (they evolved because they were close to the top of<br>
the food chain or had other kind of non-hazardous lifestyle where there<br>
is evolutionary preassure against aging). We, in turn, become so complex<br>
that errors in our more advanced functions are more likely to occur.<br>
Aging is caused by this errors and the ones mentioned ahead.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; For example, do you know that mammals can't produce</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ascorbic acid (a powerful anti-oxidant)? Little mistakes like that might</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be behind aging!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Possible, but I doubt it. We usually get enough ascorbic acid from our</i><br>
<i>&gt; food, and excrete the surplus in our urine, so being able to produce</i><br>
<i>&gt; would not be a major advantage. I seem to recall that some mammals can</i><br>
<i>&gt; produce it, but I might be wrong.</i><br>
<p>
The ascorbic acid is just an example, the fact is that a simple<br>
metabolic process might be the cause of aging. A metabolic process that<br>
occurs without errors in non-aging species (for example, tiny portions<br>
of free-radicals might be the cause of aging, minimal differences in the<br>
concentration of ascorbic acid might cause small cellular damages that<br>
cause aging). Of course this is very optimistical, but I am more<br>
convinced now than I was a few months ago that a few genes might be the<br>
cause for aging.<br>
<p>
This errors are different than the ones I mentioned above, these are<br>
errors in processes that can be corrected (on a optimistical base).<br>
Other cause of genetic errors might be our more advanced functions (like<br>
I mentioned before), this errors are surely much harder to correct (if<br>
they exist, and I think they do weather in the form of aging, or in the<br>
form of inevitable lethal diseases that affect the elderly --<br>
Alzheimer's disease, mad cow disease, some types of cancer, etc).<br>

True, around 175 divisions when compared to 50-60 divisions in our case.<br>
<p>

Neither have I, if you find any, please let me know.<br>

See ya,<br>
