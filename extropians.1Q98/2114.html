<i>	&gt;John. What is the "external universe"? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Everything that is not subjective, assuming there is anything.<br>
	   <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;we are not seperate from the universe</i><br>
	 <br>
Interesting theory.<br>
	  <br>
<i>	&gt;Say we don't have true volition and never will. What's wrong with </i><br>
<i>	&gt;that. </i><br>
	 <br>
I don't know because I don't know what you mean by "true volition". All I <br>
know is that sometimes I have the power to choose what I want but I never <br>
have the power to choose what I don't want.<br>
	<br>
<i>	&gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>	&gt;&gt;A man, animal or machine has free will if it can not always predict </i><br>
<i>	&gt;&gt;what it will do in the future even if the external environment is </i><br>
<i>	&gt;&gt;constant. A third party might be able to make such predictions but </i><br>
<i>	&gt;&gt;that's irrelevant, the important thing is that the person himself </i><br>
<i>	&gt;&gt;can not know what he will do next until he actually does it.</i><br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;jeff@illusionmachines.com (Jeff Dee) </i><br>
<i>	&gt;By this definition, a simple program that prints "Hello" to the </i><br>
<i>	&gt;screen  over and over has "free will". </i><br>
	 <br>
<p>
Yes, but what is your point? If it's that my idea gives almost everything  <br>
free will and thus the value of such a definition in helping us understand <br>
how the mind works is virtually zero then I enthusiastically agree, but that's <br>
still a vast improvement because other defenerations have a negative value, <br>
they provide confusion but no enlightenment. My advice is if you want to <br>
study the mind forget about free will, most ideas involving it are so bad <br>
they're not even wrong.<br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;It's clear and internally consistent, but I'd hardly call what it </i><br>
<i>	&gt;defines "freedom". </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Can you think of an example where my definition of freedom would cause a <br>
contradiction with the everyday use of the word? I can't.<br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;I think you need to expand your definition to include third parties: </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why would I want to do that? Freedom is a feeling, if I feel free then I am  <br>
free, how others view me is their concern not mine.<br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;no set of behaviors which can be predicted by *anyone* with 100% </i><br>
<i>	&gt;certainty sounds "free" to me.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't see how somebody else accurately predicting my behavior would change <br>
my feeling of freedom, that would only happen if I made the prediction, but <br>
let that go, even with your more restrictive definition an electron would  <br>
still have free will.<br>
