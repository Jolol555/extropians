What you're doing is saying: "look, we've got this existing system that<br>
works better than any known system - perhaps there's x system that works<br>
even better than that".  <br>
<p>
What libertarians and libertarian extropians are saying is "look, we've<br>
got this existing system that works better than any known system -<br>
perhaps we should find out *why* it works, and have *more* of whatever<br>
makes it work as well as it does."<br>
<p>
One of the conclusions we come to from this line of thought is that the<br>
whole "tinkering with the market" approach actually makes things *worse*<br>
than they would be if things were left alone.<br>
<p>
But, deeper than this, there's a certain prejudice in all this "we"<br>
talk.  This sense of "we" is a false comfort - democracy as a false god.<br>
 "We" aren't actually in the position of being able to design a system<br>
<i>&gt;from scratch.  Your camp's having the impression that we are is (from a</i><br>
libertarian point of view) part of the problem.<br>
