Dragons exist -- and before you sneer, think of the amazement that greeted <br>
the discovery of the great dinosaur fossils, just a hundred or so years <br>
ago.  Flying reptiles exist -- though not firebreathing ones, except <br>
insofar as burning is one form of oxidation.  And see Carl Sagan, 'the <br>
Dragons of Eden.'  Dragons are  nearer than you think...<br>

Unicorns exist -- if you doubt it, go rent  Ridley Scott's movie 'Legend' <br>
and see them right there, for yourself.  &gt;:-}  Why, we have two damn great <br>
golden Unicorns atop our Local Governmnet offices right here in Bristol -- <br>
the Unicorn is a symbol of the City.  &gt;:-}  Does anyone think that <br>
geneteically engineering 'new' Unicorns is any big deal, anyway?<br>
<p>
Witches exist -- on almost any definition.<br>
<p>
Magicians exist -- white ones and black ones.  And Classical Greek ones...  &gt;:-} (See Murry Hope, 'Practical Greek Magic' -- see for yourself!).<br>
<p>
Maxwell Knight, wartime chief of British Intelligence, recruited every <br>
white and black magician in the country into the WWII war effort.  Apart <br>
from 'advanced technology being indistinguishable from magic' (Arthur C. <br>
Clarke, a friend of my friend Stanley Kubrick -- they commune via fax) <br>
there is _overwhelming_ evidence that magic works. 'How' is another -- <br>
interesting -- matter.  I  will my finger to lift:  it lifts. A mystery.<br>
<p>
                      ----------- * * * * * -----------<br>
<p>
Here's a little example:<br>
<p>
I have a 'Light Doodler' gadget from Chatsworth, California, a beautiful <br>
spinning YAGI aerial with microprocessor-controlled multicoloured LEDs set <br>
around a 4" dia. circular polycarbonate ring.  You can set the controls to <br>
configure beautiful shifting patterns on the surface of a described 4" <br>
sphere. It has a built-in microphone to enable it to give you a light-show <br>
in time with music.  Natasha, you'd love it!<br>
<p>
I had this gadget set up atop my TV.  Behind the TV were the covers of <br>
Enya's first three -- magical -- albums -- 'Watermark'; 'Shepherd Moons'; <br>
and 'The Celts.'<br>
<p>
The YAGI aerial was gently 'hunting' to and fro. I looked intently at the <br>
first album cover.  The YAGI instantly locked onto the first album cover, <br>
"Watermark.'  I thought: 'Interesting...' and then thought 'Let's see what <br>
happens if I direct my gaze to to the second album.'<br>
<p>
I flicked my gaze  over, and the YAGI loop instantly pointed and locked <br>
directly onto Shepherd Moons.  "Hey, Ho", I thought, and flicked my gaze to <br>
'The Celts.' Instantly, the loop pointed and locked.  I carried on <br>
like this for ten minutes or so, until it got boring doing it.<br>
<p>
This kinda thing happens all the time in my life.  When I was an atheist <br>
skeptic, it used to drive me damn near crazy.  &gt;:-}  I actually preferred <br>
trying to think I _was_ crazy instead of simply accepting overwhelming <br>
empirical tested and corroborated evidence.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
                      ----------- * * * * * -----------<br>
<p>
Another little example. Three times out of three tries I've done this.<br>
<p>
Each time, I asked a kid (around 8 or 9) if they  knew about 'the Force' <br>
in 'STAR WARS.'<br>
<p>
"Yes!" they said.<br>
<p>
"OK", said I, "Let's see if the Force is strong in you. Pick up this pair <br>
of dice, close your eyes, and picture a pair of sixes."<br>
<p>
"Yes" they said.<br>
<p>
"OK: now throw a pair of sixes" sez I.<br>
<p>
Each and every time, they threw a pair of sixes...<br>
<p>
Easy-peasy...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
"Sireens" I'm not too sure about...  Isn't that what police cars have? <br>
<i>&gt;:-}</i><br>
<p>
 [FX: "Wow! Will you just listen to that!" ]<br>
<p>
_Sirens_ are women...  They often inhabit mountainous places, I understand.<br>
<p>
<p>
 [ FX: "You have to believe we are magic; _nothing_ can stand in our way"]<br>
