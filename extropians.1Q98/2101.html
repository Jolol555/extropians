<i>&gt; I don't know about you, but many of us have chosen their goals quite early</i><br>

<i>&gt; certain technologies, physical/chemical sciencies and computer modelling</i><br>
<i>&gt; has certainly not been caused by reading Diamond Age. In fact it goes back</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the early childhood. Many influential movers &amp; shakers (just to name</i><br>
<i>&gt; Minsky, Moravec, Tipler, Drexler, Merkle, de Garis, ...) share our memetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; set, whether formally or de facto. Their 'everyday life' is certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; having nontrivial impact. I honestly cannot assess how much the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropians/transhumanists as a bulk can contribute to the bleeding edge in</i><br>
<i>&gt; science/technology/memefection, but yes, it does seem like a worthwhile</i><br>
<i>&gt; goal to pursue.</i><br>
Yes, certainly. I salute the effort of all those who directly contribute to<br>
progress,<br>
and I'm not suggesting that they should drop everything in order to pursue some<br>
elusive dream...BUT some of us who aren't great scientists, writers, artists etc,<br>
might find it useful and fulfilling to contribute to transhumanism by, for example,<br>
building a totally free safe haven. For fun, mutual stimulation and just in case...<br>
The failure of this (low profile) project would hardly mean the end of<br>
transhumanism,<br>
just like the failure of the Oceania project didn't wipe out libertarianism. <br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; [ making it through the Singularity is challenging enough ]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Unless transhumanists get somehow organized the chances that any of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; us will make it past singularity are close to zero; the powers that be will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; crush us all like worms. Only (some of) the rich and powerful are going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; make it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Having a single friend High Above should suffice. (And a little redundancy</i><br>
<i>&gt; won't hurt).  Becoming one of the rich &amp; powerful should thus not be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; minor point on the transhumanist agenda.  If you are so smart then why</i><br>
<i>&gt; ain't you rich? Why, indeed? </i><br>
Well, for starters, I *don't* claim to be smart. I'm just an ordinary guy who's<br>
not really good at anything. Other people on this list *are* smart howerver,<br>
yet most of them aren't astronomically rich afaik, which is strange. With<br>
all this brainpower "under one roof" it should be a piece of cake to become<br>
a rich &amp; powerful movement, but as we all know, this hasn't happened so<br>
far. That's a shame, certainly when you see all kinds of bullshit cults<br>
like scientology swimming in cash. Imagine what all that money could<br>
accomplish if it was used on for example cryonics, biotech and uploading <br>
research.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No-one said it's *easy*, but it doesn't take a superhuman effort either. Others</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have done it, so why can't we?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What have they gained by it? What focuses have they neglected by gaining</i><br>
<i>&gt; it? What was the empirical critical resource threshold in their efforts to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be successul? See?</i><br>
It's true that most autonomous communities are/were far from ideal, but that's<br>
mainly because the freedom-seekers are/were carriers of less-than-optimal <br>
memes. There is no precedent (as far as I know) for a transhuman autonomous<br>
region, so there's nothing to compare to. The only way to answer your questions<br>
is to go out and do it. The only thing that *is* sure is that since other groups<br>
of people have apparently succeded (or failed for trivial reasons), nation building<br>
is a real possibility.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The neoluddites are an insignificant bunch of morons, and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the real problem. Organized crime and governments on the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Tell that Gelernter, who has had his hands blown off by the Unabomber. An</i><br>
<i>&gt; insignificant moron who is also a fairly competent molecular virologist is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not longer so very insignificant in terms of the damage. A petty terrorist</i><br>
<i>&gt; taking out 50 leading ExI heads + guest speakers by a fertilizer/fuel</i><br>
<i>&gt; carbomb is not so very petty anymore, I am afraid. Even if the risk be</i><br>
<i>&gt; small it is not zero.</i><br>
Aren't these arguments actually supporting the autonomous nation concept?<br>
Lone nuts like the Unabomber (a relatively rare phenomenon) can easily<br>
single out and maim/kill isolated, unorganized and thus vulnerable targets<br>
like scientists, and yes, extropians. A low-profile, distant and relatively<br>
well defended (no gun laws etc.) island is a *very unlikely* target for <br>
terrorists (they probably won't even know it exists), and thus the place of<br>
choice to do "controversial" research and the like. Besides, if someone<br>
really wants to kill extropians, he'll just hit an Extro gathering as you<br>
already suggested. Piece of cake compared to taking out a whole<br>
island nation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Organized crime is not that a large problem as I have learned from most</i><br>
<i>&gt; recent observations (caution: sample size bias). (Interesting enough that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same picture painted by your favourite lillywhite monopoly always</i><br>
<i>&gt; winds up such a bugbear). Street thugs are not a problem, a minimum of</i><br>
<i>&gt; streetsmartness assuming (Btw, I am not armed for the police is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; significantly higher danger here), and higher echelons are</i><br>
<i>&gt; indistinguishable from state.  They are interested in milking, not killing</i><br>
<i>&gt; you. Remember, the state _is_ the mafia here. </i><br>
The fact remains that on an isolated private island the chances that you'll<br>
be the victim of (violent) crime are close to zero, while in "normal countries"<br>
(especially the cities) these chances are a *lot* higher. Increased personal<br>
safety is of course just one of the many advantages of geographic isolation <br>
and private law. And, believe it or not, the mafia and the state are still pretty<br>
much two separate entities in most western countries, with their own <br>
agenda's of killing and milking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A lot of small nuisances still can make life miserable. Instead of enduring </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; decades of paying taxes, filling out forms for every stupid thing, waiting</i><br>
periods,<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; legal injustice, petty crime and all the other crap that's related to our</i><br>
societies,<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you can focus on one major effort, and reap the fruits for many years to come.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A private nation is an investment that can ultimately save you a lot of money</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and frustration. It's the embodyment of personal freedom and responsibility.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, I believe you that you believe that, but it does sound a lot like</i><br>
<i>&gt; propaganda to me. </i><br>
Sure, all idealists, politicians and used car salesmen sound alike...;)<br>
So what? Regardless of pompous-ass language the point still stands:<br>
there are great advantages to having your own nation. Relaxed living,<br>
no (or very low) taxes, no (or hardly) bureacracy, greater personal<br>
safety, optimal suspension conditions, unique business options<br>
(all the things you can do on for example the Cayman Islands and<br>
then some -- after all, *you* are the law) THE place to have parties<br>
&amp; conferences, enjoy an extropic vacation, meet people etc. Yes, yes,<br>
I know, it sounds like another advertisment...but it's true!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You obviously do not see the simple virtues of careful</i><br>
<i>&gt; realism. You wouldn't believe how many things how soon a bunch of</i><br>
<i>&gt; energetic bright individualists can scrogg up. This _can_ be rewarding</i><br>
<i>&gt; learning experience on its own, agreed. Just count me out. </i><br>
No-one is forcing you (or anyone else) to join anything. I understand that those<br>
on the list who have a good job, and/or are doing major scientific work have<br>
better things to do than nation-building. If you are still young (at heart), and no <br>
up-and-coming rocket scientist on the other hand, this might be a worthwile <br>
and fun project. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; new designer drugs (the "grey area" kind that's not yet universally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; recognized as illegal) and virtual porn (apart from kids just about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anything goes) and world lotteries and other gambling activities</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (virtual or otherwise) a distant retreat is highly recommended. Money &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fun in the sun, what else could you want? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think yours is a remarkably cynic perspective. Remember, we are all</i><br>
<i>&gt; supposed to be sheep in wolf's clothing here.</i><br>
Would you mind to eleborate, 'cause I don't see any cynicism in the <br>
business proposals above...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; [ don't put all your eggs in one basket ]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think you're a lot safer on your private island than in a big city, for</i><br>
example,<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and *should* someone try to bother you (which is unlikely if you keep a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reasonably low profile) you have at least the means to defend yourself </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (your budget is the only limit). </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am unlikely to find myself at the receiving end of a tactical nuke or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bunch of marines on the streets of a city. </i><br>
Right, you'll be hit by a car or mugged instead. Great! Again, the chances<br>
that anyone will attack your island (with nukes for chrissake??) are absolutely<br>
minimal. People just don't care about this sort of thing, as long as you don't<br>
start to blatently export dope, kiddyporn etc. Most banana republics that *did*<br>
get invaded were in fact US pawns "run amock" (took more than their fair share <br>
of CIA drug money or whatever). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; [ personally demonstrate efficieny of your memecluster ]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What's the alternative plan, then?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Make money 2) Donate some of it for worthwhile purposes (ExI would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; an instance) 3) reiterate above until you've run into the Singularity or</i><br>
<i>&gt; suddenly realize you are floating in a liquid nitrogen Dewar. Really</i><br>
<i>&gt; simple, and unspectacular, eh?</i><br>
Yes, way too unspectacular for a transhuman ;-) And, more importantly, risky.<br>
You'll be hardly in a better position for the Singularity than Jack the Lad,<br>
and Jack's chances *are not good*.<br>
<p>
By the way, oil tankers may be too expensive/cumbersome for nation<br>
building, but some smaller passenger vessels (maybe previously used<br>
as floating hotels or so) might be more practical and affordable. You<br>
buy the ship, and sail it to (or have it towed) your uninhabited island<br>
where it's ankered permanently. Buildings etc. can be added later,<br>
but this way you have a relatively comfortable (and more or less mobile)<br>
place to live. Since you only use fuel (you could even use sails) for the <br>
(one) trip, costs are relatively low compared to the moving oil tanker <br>
scenario. On location solar/wind/wave energy can be used for your<br>
power needs, that's mostly a one-time investment; running costs can<br>
be low.<br>
