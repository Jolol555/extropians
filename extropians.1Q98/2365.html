It doesn't make much difference, if the photons are reflected the target will <br>
receive twice the photons momentum, if it is absorbed it will still receive <br>
the photon's momentum and its energy too.<br>

Right, and that will cause the inner material to implode inward and compress.  <br>
Ouch.                  <br>

I don't understand what you're getting at, of course hot things cool off by <br>
radiation.<br>

Going underground won't help much, during the gulf war bunker busting bombs <br>
penetrated 30 feet of steel reinforced concrete to destroy installations, and <br>
they just had chemical explosives, H bombs could do much better. I suggest <br>
you visit the island of Elugelab, that's where the USA detonated a bomb that <br>
was expected to be of less than 5 megatons but actually produced 15 megatons.  <br>
They blew it up in 1954 on top of a short tower, it produced a fireball 4 <br>
miles in diameter, it terrified the scientists who set it off and trapped <br>
them in their bunker for several days on an island 10 miles away, and it <br>
killed the Japanese sailors on the fishing boat Fukuryu Maru- The lucky <br>
Dragon, who were far from the official danger area and well inside the <br>
"safety" zone.  Actually I'm being unfair, you can't visit Elugelab anymore, <br>
but if you have a submarine you can look at the crater on the sea floor 250 <br>
feet deep and 6500 feet across where Elugelab once was.<br>

<i>       &gt;&gt;the foam further from the fission trigger must receive weaker X rays        </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;and explode with less power, this would compress the fusion cylinder        </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;unevenly making a dud.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Maybe that's why they took polymer foam instead of polymer solid,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and adjusted the geometry accordingly to compensate for that. </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Maybe, but then the design would be inefficient because if the foam was that <br>
ephemeral then most of the X rays energy would pass through all the foam and  <br>
be wasted, it would not be available to compress the fusion cylinder. Why not <br>
use radiation pressure?<br>
<p>
I found a quotation that gives some support to my theory that the polymer <br>
foam's main function was to protect vital parts made of heavy atoms for a few  <br>
extra nanoseconds, and its use as a plasma generator of only secondary  <br>
importance. Jacob Wechsler was a H bomb engineer and he's talking about  <br>
Carson Mark, the chief designer of the first H bomb:<br>
<p>
 "He was really concerned about higher Z materials [elements with higher <br>
  atomic number] being exposed. In a radiation environment with high energy <br>
  radiation  coming down from the primary, anything like steel because it's <br>
  so dense will cause a pressure spike when it vaporizes. Carson was trying <br>
  to sustain a deuterium burn and he was afraid that if things blew off at<br>
  higher Z that  might chop up the fuel, its temperature wouldn't stay high <br>
  enough [...]  the surface of the lead would blow off so we covered the lead <br>
  with plastic, with polyethylene. That was low Z, just CH2  [hydrogen and <br>
  carbon]. From a time point of view the radiation ionization of the heavy <br>
  materials with all that shielding would be so late that it would have <br>
  zilch effect on the overall system."<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There's a reason thermonuclear devices are so difficult to build. </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
I wonder, are they difficult to build? Over 100,000 of the damn things have <br>
been made and several hundred have exploded in tests, some with very unusual <br>
designs, and yet there has not been one dud and most turned out to be more <br>
powerful than expected.                         <br>
