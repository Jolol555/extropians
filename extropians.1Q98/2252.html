<i>&gt;  contributes to another.</i><br>
<p>
Lawyers and jurists have been struggling with this question for as long as<br>
there is a record of law.  Among the most insightful discussions of causation<br>
in law and ethics ever written is the decision of the great Benjamin Cardozo<br>
in Palsgraf v. Long Island Rail Co., 248 N.Y. 399, 162 N.E. 99 (1928).  The<br>
Keystone Cops facts of that case served as the focus of Cardozo's unraveling<br>
of the concepts of duty, breach, cause in fact, proximate cause and harm.<br>
Among the brilliant observations to be found in Palsgraf:<br>
<p>
	The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed, <br>
	and risk imports relation; it is risk to another or to others within <br>
	the range of apprehension.<br>
<p>
	What we do mean by the word ‘proximate' [in causation] is that, <br>
	because of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of <br>
	justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events <br>
	beyond a certain point.  This is not logic.  It is practical politics.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, perhaps, the toughest application of these principles is to<br>
situations in which the basic duty of one person to another is unclear or<br>
subject to reasonable doubt.  It is not cause, per se, that concerns you,<br>
Darren, but duty.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The introductory message to this list claims that Extropians may have an</i><br>
<i>&gt;  interest in "rational ethics (ethics for survival and flourishing)". This</i><br>
<i>&gt;  must surprise a lot of list members, who seem to take a far more</i><br>
<i>&gt;  libertarian view of ethics. Many here seem to take the view that it's OK to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  do what you like, so long as you don't harm anyone else. I challenge those</i><br>
<i>&gt;  people to place a boundary around causing "harm to anyone else". Every</i><br>
<i>&gt;  action a person takes will affect every other person to some small extent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  You can't live your life without causing harm to someone else. All you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;  do is mitigate the degree of harm whilst promoting your objectives. I for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  one have an interest in the "rational ethics" declared in the introduction.</i><br>
<p>
The answer lies not in conundrums of causation, but in an analysis of duty and<br>
costs.  Every action has consequences, intended and unintended, foreseeable<br>
and surprising, proximate and attenuated.  While I have a duty to not trespass<br>
upon another, I also have a duty to protect myself from the unexpected, the<br>
unintended and the attenuated results of others' actions.  This duty is the<br>
price of life in society.  As it happens, in most instances protecting myself<br>
from such things is far less expensive than protecting others from the<br>
unlikely and distant results of my own actions.  Through reasonable caution,<br>
insurance and other financial and social risk-shifting devices, I create a<br>
buffer zone of protection around myself that makes life with others possible.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Which brings me, finally, to the point. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Someone you know, rationally, carefully and thoughtfully, decides that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  is time to end their life. Such an action has a number of easily</i><br>
<i>&gt;  identifiable anti-Extropic effects.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  What is the right thing to do? Do you give the person their liberty, or do</i><br>
<i>&gt;  you exercise your "ethics for survival and flourishing" and forcibly remove</i><br>
<i>&gt;  it?</i><br>
<p>
This is one of the toughest problems of a rational ethics that prizes<br>
individual liberty.  On the one hand, one presumes that individual autonomy is<br>
the bedrock of a rational ethics.  On the other, a paramount value on life<br>
itself seems to be the sine qua non of any POSSIBILITY of sane moral action.<br>
For myself, I cut this Gordian knot in favor of judging any suicide by a being<br>
not experiencing intolerable pain with an organic cause as so irrational, so<br>
inconsistent with any sane view of life itself, that such a person has lost at<br>
least some of their rights to autonomy.  In this view, the truly self-<br>
destructive person becomes, in a sense the adversary of his rational friends:<br>
He may wish to kill himself, but that wish is in opposition to the judgment of<br>
others that the would-be suicide be returned to a rational view of the<br>
paramount value of life.  For those who care about the self-destructive<br>
person, a duty arises to stop the suicide and to provide assistance to them,<br>
EVEN IN THE FACE OF THAT PERSON'S EXPRESSED WISHES.  If the one who would do<br>
away with himself desires that end strongly enough, they will simply accept<br>
the opposition of their friends as a condition of "success" in their desire to<br>
die.<br>
<p>
This is not an entirely satisfactory solution to what is, at its essence, a<br>
moral paradox.  Rather, it comes from "a rough sense of justice . . . This is<br>
not logic.  It is practical politics."  The practical politics of friendship.<br>
