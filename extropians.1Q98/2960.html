<p>
<p>
I wasn't trying to accuse anybody on this list of wanting to kill people,<br>
and in fact Alejandro proved in a later post to be an intelligent reasonable<br>
man, just wrong about socialism. The important point is not what some member<br>
of the list thinks, but what governments think, all governments, no<br>
exceptions; they will just not take no for an answer. If a government tells<br>
somebody to do something they usually will and the violence is only implicit,<br>
but if they refuse to obey the violence will become explicit, mild at first<br>
but escalating without limit until they make an offer that can't be refused.<br>
It makes no difference if it started over some trivial matter, unless there<br>
is obedience somewhere down the line confrontation with the government can<br>
end only one way, a bullet in the brain.<br>
<p>

<i>        &gt;&gt;Communism can't make poor people rich but it can make rich people</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;poor. What puzzles me is why you think &gt; that's a virtue.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This of course depends on how you define 'poor' and 'rich'.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Some truth in that, rich and poor are relative concepts not absolute.<br>
For example, in Stalin's day the USSR imported very few American movies <br>
but one they did was the classic "The Grapes Of Wrath", it's a tragedy <br>
about the suffering of a very poor farm family in Oklahoma who are forced by <br>
drought to give up their farm, load up everything they own on their old truck, <br>
and move to California. The Soviets thought it would be good propaganda to <br>
show a poor American family, but it didn't work as expected and was soon<br>
withdrawn from Russian circulation. To American audiences the people in the  <br>
movie seemed horribly poor, the Russian people on the other hand figured the <br>
characters must be aristocrats, these people actually owned their own truck.<br>
<p>
Having said that however I still thing there are more enlightened approaches<br>
to world poverty than the socialistic one, make everybody equally poor.<br>
I think the Capitalistic method is more fun, create more wealth.<br>
