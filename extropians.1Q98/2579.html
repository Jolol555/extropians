Unions in a more or less strict libertarian regime should be able to keep<br>
members if the latter have contracted away their freedom to leave (presumably<br>
with various sanity-checking provisions, unless those are left to the courts<br>
as need arises.)  Then their task is reduced to inducing people in the<br>
industry to sign on in the first place, or having exclusive hiring contracts<br>
with employers preventing non-members from being hired.  (Vague memories of<br>
Twain's description of a river-pilots' guild come to mind.)<br>

Then again, the same logic should apply to legal cartels, which have had short<br>
lifetimes in the past.  And there are fewer members of a cartel than a union.<br>
Then again, ability to monitor is a key factor.  Information gathering and<br>
exchange has improved, so collectives should be easier, unless<br>
crypto-anarchist visions come true, in which case monitoring would be very<br>
hard.<br>
