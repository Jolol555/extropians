the reason why this is happening is NOT because you are responding to all<br>
participants, but because you have your reader set to send duplicates back to<br>
yourself. In the case of the list, your mail reader is taking the TO: line as<br>
you and sending it to the TO: individual, which is also the list. you need to<br>
not send duplicates back to your self.<br>

<i>&gt; Based on the non sequitur responses I got, I don't think my posting was</i><br>
<i>&gt; very clear.  Let me try again.  I know how to use my individual software so</i><br>
<i>&gt; as to not disrupt the List.  As a Network and Security Engineer, my</i><br>
<i>&gt; question is why we have configured this List so that every Netscape and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Eudora e-mail client has a button on their tool-bar that will disrupt this</i><br>
<i>&gt; List?  Do we really think the solution is warn all the List participants to</i><br>
<i>&gt; "never push this button"?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Netscape and Eudora mailers have toolbars that contain two reply buttons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; One button is a "Reply-to-All" button which replies to the list and to all</i><br>
<i>&gt; particpants (sender, receiver, cc'd persons) to make sure they get copies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This keeps participants who are not on the mailing List from getting</i><br>
<i>&gt; dropped from future discussion.  The Other button is a "Reply-to-Single"</i><br>
<i>&gt; button that will only reply to the List only. This button drops</i><br>
<i>&gt; participants who are not on the mailing list from future discussion.  Both</i><br>
<i>&gt; of these buttons are available at all times, and the user can always hit</i><br>
<i>&gt; either one.  We cannot control which button a user hits to reply.  Some</i><br>
<i>&gt; people have suggested setting the "defaults" in the e-mail client, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; these defaults only set which function key calls which button.  Both</i><br>
<i>&gt; buttons are always available on the toolbar and the users who use the</i><br>
<i>&gt; buttons still have to remember which one to hit for this List.  There is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; way to restrict the software to only type of reply.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Extropians List is set up so that only one of these Reply buttons will</i><br>
<i>&gt; work as expected with no side effects.  The user cannot choose what kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; reply to use.  Only one button will produce a single posting, whereas the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other button will trigger a cascade of duplicate postings for any followups</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the message.   Control for who should be included in the reply is</i><br>
<i>&gt; restricted by the centralized List software and is not left to the user.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The centralized List software requires specific choices from the end user</i><br>
<i>&gt; if it is to function correctly.  If the end user makes the wrong choices,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the entire List will suffer the disruptions in future posts.  The reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; for this is that this List advertises itself in the headers as being two</i><br>
<i>&gt; "extropians" lists, one at "extropy.com" and one at "extropy.org".  When a</i><br>
<i>&gt; user tries to Reply-to-All, they send copies to both of these Lists, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; both go to the same destination.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Other Lists are setup in a way that either Reply button will work as</i><br>
<i>&gt; expected with no side effects.  The user can choose what kind of reply to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use.  Both buttons work, and the List always gets one and only one posting.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Control for who should be included in the reply is left to the user.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; centralized List software does not require any specific choices for the end</i><br>
<i>&gt; user.  The reason for this is that most lists have a single name only.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They are only listed under one name in the headers, so there is one and</i><br>
<i>&gt; only one reply to the List in any case.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do we desire to be set up so only one Reply button will work?  Is there a</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason why we don't want this List set up like other Lists so that either</i><br>
<i>&gt; button will work?  Do we want to make the user's choice not disruptive in</i><br>
<i>&gt; either case?  Or do we want to allow every List participant to have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; button on their desktop that can disrupt the List on every single message?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do the benefits of calling this List both "extropians@extropy.com" and</i><br>
<i>&gt; "extropians@extropy.org" outweigh the annoyance of the duplicate messages?</i><br>
