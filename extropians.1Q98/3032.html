<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks for the clarification. I'm interested in growth of the corpus of technical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;knowledge and its rate of increase. Your argument appears to apply to growth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;of the measured economic value of the technology, and may be very valid.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Actually, the corpus of academic knowledge, as measured by the person-years of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; academic research and by published articles, has been doubling every decade I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; think for ~150 years.    Recently this rate has SLOWED DOWN as academic has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reached budget limits.  See "Little Science, Big Science" book.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm, this would mean that we are producing roughly 32,000 times as many papers</i><br>
<i>&gt; per year as we were in 1848. That's a lotta paper. I haven't read your reference, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; I do know that the acedemic publishing business percieves itself as being in crisis.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In today's world there may be disencentives to publication such that the publication</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a paper is not a linear measure of an increment to the corpus. I have no reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt; alternative, though.</i><br>
<p>
The alternative to the academic publishing establishment is self publishing, via xerox,<br>
ditributed print on demand, HTML, etc.  Easy to use desktop publishing software is the<br>
threat to the academic publishing houses, not a dearth of publishable material. They just<br>
can't compete as they are structured now. If they wished to get with the program, they'd<br>
evolve themselves into internet content providers of scientific papers online, in HTML,<br>
PDF, PS and other formats, providing a commons for peer review online, using backlinking.<br>
Those that don't will have steadily narrowing business.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I do know that there is a tremendous amount of technical progress that is not captured</i><br>
<i>&gt; in papers in peer-reviewed journals. In my field of data communications, a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; stuff is in journals, but much more is in specification documents, code, RFCs, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; standards documents. A great deal more is in patents, trade secrets, and other</i><br>
<i>&gt; unpublished material thta is nonetheless part of the technical background information</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the industry builds on. Programmers and hardware engineers learn this stuff and</i><br>
<i>&gt; then take it with them from job to job because it sinks into their general body of</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge. It's just not possible to remember where you learned each neat trick and</i><br>
<i>&gt; what the IPR status of the idea was, so only blatant IPR infringments are likely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosecuted or even remembered.: this stuff just becomes part of the state of the art.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Can you recommend other measures of technical progress? Mine are almost all apocriphal</i><br>
<i>&gt; or qualitative.</i><br>
<p>
a) average speed of various commercial transportationb) average energy consumption per<br>
capita, times the average energy efficiency per capita.<br>
c) in combat: i) ratio of wounded to killed (higher tech will have greater killed, less<br>
wounded.<br>
                ii) survival rate of wounded<br>
                iii) number of 'rounds' expended per KIA (this includes everything from<br>
bullets to ICBMs)(smarter weapons will have more kills per 'round')<br>
d) average time to download a 10 file, 300k HTML page, or just average modem speed.<br>
e) average size of the average credit report<br>
f) how much time it takes to clean the mildew out of my tub ;) today is cleanup day....<br>
