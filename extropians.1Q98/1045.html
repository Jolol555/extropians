In response to: Eugene Leitl &lt;eugene@liposome.genebee.msu.su&gt;, M. E. Smith<br>
&lt;mesmith@rocketmail.com&gt; and Brent Allsop &lt;allsop@swttools.fc.hp.com&gt;<br>
<p>
Rational means (to me) that you neither promote, or seek, genocide, <br>
coercion etc, but you don't *automatically* reject them either. There<br>
are no "good" or "evil" actions, just tools that help you to survive<br>
and prosper. Sometimes the smart thing to do might be helping others,<br>
sometimes it means damaging them. A "rational" person/animal/being<br>
is *opportunistic*, and not bound by any rules that don't help to maximize<br>
his success. Of course, IRL such an entity would probably (and duely?) be <br>
called an "asshole" by most people.<br>
<p>
You can have (sub) societies based on this principle, in theory at least.<br>
A good example would be the group of vampires from "Intervieuw with a (the?)<br>
Vampire" (the movie). These folks have only one rule: you are not allowed<br>
to kill (or otherwise damage, I suppose) one of your own kind. Offenders are<br>
executed. What you do to outsiders is irrelevant (as long as it doesn't somehow<br>
harm members of your own group). This is the core of any rational society: a social <br>
contract for mutual benefit, which includes non-agression within the group itself. <br>
This sounds almost libertarian, doesn't it. IMO this is about as close as you can <br>
get to "pure rationality".<br>
<p>
My original remark:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Seriously...Wax has a point. Why are Star Trek (or My Little Pony)</i><br>
<i>&gt; ethics so popular with this allegedly rational crowd? It does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; compute.</i><br>
See, the very mild, sometimes even altruistic, "vibe" on the list is in no<br>
way what one (I) would call "rational" (unless faked, in which case it would<br>
be very rational indeed). It is seems to be in sharp contrast with the (otherwise) <br>
no-BS (classically rational) approach of extropianism. That's all. I'm not <br>
endorsing genocide or otherwise nasty behaviour, just a bit puzzled by this<br>
apparent contradiction.<br>
<p>
Love &amp; peace to all ;-)<br>
