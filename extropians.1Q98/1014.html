Not quite true. The human eye contains, in effect, two different imaging<br>
systems: the fovea, and the rest of the retina. In the vicinity of the<br>
fovea you get good colour vision and very high resolution -- it's what<br>
you see the 'l' in 'resolution' with, and it covers a couple of degrees<br>
(at most) of the field of view. The rest of the retina combined has<br>
about the same number of photoreceptive cells, and covers a much wider<br>
field; it's less sensitive to colour, much lower resolution, but is<br>
functional in very low light levels.<br>
<p>
I think there are some figures for visual data sensitivity in Foley, Van<br>
Damm et al, but it's a while since I had to read that (read: since I last<br>
had anything to do with real-time photorealistic rendering for <br>
simulator graphics engines). About 4kx4k pixels springs to mind ...<br>
