<i>&gt; &gt;Unfortunately replacing aged organs doesn't seem to help much,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;especially since the organs we really would like to rejuvenate (immune</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;system, endocrine system and possibly the brain) are not easy to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;transplant or replace.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In some/many cases, there might be psychological benefits.  Naturally,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it'd be great to rejuvenate/replace the immune or endocrine systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, some people tend to get very depressed over, say, their</i><br>
<i>&gt; looks.  Ergo, skin replacement might alleviate that problem AND allow</i><br>
<i>&gt; research on that organ (the skin) to carry over to others (the endocrine?).</i><br>
<i>&gt; The fit here is loose, but not so loose as to make it unlikely.</i><br>
<p>
Well, you are right, but the psychological benefits will not help<br>
extend life significantly as far as I know, and the dangers of<br>
transplants should not be underestimated (the more medicine I learn,<br>
the less eager I am for invasive surgery :-).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; totipotent cells is another area to investigate.  It is my understanding,</i><br>
<i>&gt; this is not hard, given some experiments with transplanting embryo</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain cells to Parkinson's sufferers (human or otherwise, I can't recall).</i><br>
<p>
Human and animals. There have been a lot of work done in this field,<br>
and the results are starting to appear. So far it looks like the<br>
transplants help, but not much. But animal studies show that nerve<br>
grafts can do some amazing things (turning and growing in the right<br>
direction, finding the right targets etc), so I think there is reason<br>
to be hopeful. I don't know if anybody has yet looked at what happens<br>
if you implant totiopotent cells as regarding to aging.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I was under the impression that gene therapy was already being done</i><br>
<i>&gt; with genetically engineered cells which provided products directly</i><br>
<i>&gt; inside/to the body.  I see no principled reason why this can't be done</i><br>
<i>&gt; for hormones or Vitamin C or what have you.</i><br>
<p>
That should work. The problem might be where to put them, but for<br>
substances that are very bioactive not many cells are needed. One fun<br>
possibility is otherwise to use engineered gut bacteria - they produce<br>
vitamin K, so why not C?<br>
