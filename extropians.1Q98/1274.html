In a message dated 98-01-28 21:22:13 EST, you write:<br>

&lt;&lt; CALYK writes<br>
 : isnt the reason the south american rainforests are getting burned is to<br>
make<br>
 : room for cows?   And they eat up the resources (fertilized soil from ash,<br>
to<br>
 : grow grazing grass) in a few years and then they have to burn more forest?<br>
 <br>
 So, in Brazil cows represent plunder and waste.<br>
 (Clearing the Amazon is, of course, a government project.)<br>
 Does this prove anything about cows elsewhere?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
umm, most cows are brown?<br>
<p>
its just another addition to the "cows are unnecessary" list, as far as using<br>
them to support the meat industry.  the rainforest affects everyone in all<br>
parts of the world, it is providing unknown viruses from us messing with it,<br>
and the cures that exist within are perhaps becoming extinct, along with the<br>
1-3 species a day of organisms.  Have you ever had a harvest burger?  It is<br>
very good.  It'll only be a matter of time before you cannot tell the<br>
difference in texture or taste at all between grain and meat burgers, except<br>
that the grain burgers will be made to taste better and will be much better<br>
for you.  Meat is another part of the caffeine/nicotine/money/ego/greed fix<br>
