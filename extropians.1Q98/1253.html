<i>&gt; &gt; Thus spake under the greatest rhetorical error/intentional fraud the liberal</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nuts can muster: that animals are sentient. If something cannot come up to me</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and discuss the weather, its not sentient.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I hear your challenge and raise you one Hellen Keller. Failing that, try</i><br>
<i>&gt; looking into the treatment of blind people back before Braile was invented,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or deaf-blind people for that matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Human beings are sentient and can communicate. The organs of communication</i><br>
<i>&gt; are not essential for sentient existence. Ergo, here is an existence</i><br>
<i>&gt; proof for sentience in the absence of communication.</i><br>
<p>
Using exceptions (i.e. disabled/mutated) to prove the rule is another typical<br>
liberal bullshit rhetorical method. If a mutant cow that sudden developed<br>
intelligence came up to me tomorrow and said, "howdy doo", does that mean that all<br>
normal moron cows deserve my protection? I don't think so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course, using this as an argument against eating cattle is highly</i><br>
<i>&gt; suspect; it can be taken to ridiculous extremes. ("Here's my pet rock,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Elmer. Say hello to Elmer. Sorry he can't hear you, but I assure you he's</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleased to meet you.") However, I'm deeply uneasy about arguments based</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the idea that anything that can't talk or write isn't worthy of some</i><br>
<i>&gt; consideration; and I suspect that if she could form grammatically correct</i><br>
<i>&gt; structures and communicate them my pet cat would agree with me.</i><br>
<p>
That disabled humans can be taught to communicate by other means than speech or<br>
writing english is evidence enough. How many cows have farted a symphony to you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; (As an aside, however, I _do_ apply your communication/sentience argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the oxymoronic topic of "animal rights". Rights imply a contractual</i><br>
<i>&gt; arrangement; if I can enter into an agreement with another species, then,</i><br>
<i>&gt; well, I'll concede it has rights. If it can't enter into an agreement with</i><br>
<i>&gt; me, though, any concessions I make to it can't, by definition, be contractual</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;                                             ........ Since your typical vegan</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is also an atheist, or at best, a rational non-dietical buddhist, they cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; claim the protections of the Natural Law doctrine, so they must then agree</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness only applies to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; individuals who are willing to use force, or employ others to use force, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; attain and protect those rights for themselves, i.e. the Force Doctrine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Eh?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You're assuming a rights-based transaction between humans and their prey.</i><br>
<p>
Essentially, but as a contest of rights. A prey that flees is contesting my right to<br>
eat it. If I catch it, I've proven my fitness/right to do so. Classic natural<br>
selection. A cow that contests nothing implies no contestation of right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But what's to stop the humans simply voluntarily conceding that they * will</i><br>
<i>&gt; not eat meat *, no matter what? Like, maybe, because they don't like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; taste? They need concede no rights whatsoever to the animals in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; justify not eating them.</i><br>
<p>
THis is entirely reasonable, and does not imply that animals have rights as a<br>
natural state. That prey normally do not take offense at a predators use of force<br>
outside of an instinctual flight reaction and do not defend others of their kind<br>
(again with a few exceptional species which typically are thought to be in the<br>
intelligence grey area anyways) indicates that concepts like rights do not exist in<br>
the wild. If an animal cannot conceive the concept, then they cannot posess the<br>
concept.<br>

<i>&gt; My cat is a carnivore. She 'thinks' anything that moves and is smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt; than her is food -- simple as that. (I have no _idea_ what she thinks I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am.) I am an omnivore, but I don't feel any urge to eat my cat, even though</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm told cats are edible. Just to add to the picture, my girlfriend is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a vegan, _but_ when quizzed about it confesses to not knowing how she'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; react if anyone came up with a way of farming anencephalic cattle (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; opens another can of worms, as genetically engineered anencephalic frogs</i><br>
<i>&gt; and mice are yesterday's headlines).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If the human race becomes all herbivores, what species will then claim the job</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of top carnivore???</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The species that have already got it. Remember, we're all food for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; prokaryotes in the end. (At least until we manage to develop uploading.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And even then, we might find there's something that eats human minds ...)</i><br>
<p>
parasites? I'm thinking of predators that work for their meals. Perhaps as things<br>
accelerate, we might develop human variants or other predators that will cull out<br>
the weak. You'll notice how penal psychology refers to many criminals as<br>
'predators'. If they are the predators, does this mean that psychology has already<br>
abdicated our role for us and thinks of  well adjusted people as  'sheep'???<br>
