Someone (Zev Bryant)  left a copy of nature:structural biology on my<br>
floor. The article with the heavy reading was related to a new-to-the-west<br>
nootropic herb called huperzia serrata; drug compound in medline as<br>
huperzine.  (chinese/sawtooth club moss - looks like mistletoe) <br>
<p>
It only has 43 mentions so far on altavista, most of which have nothing to<br>
do with pharmacology.  You can probably get it -now- in chinatown.  I hope<br>
it is a better smart drug than ginkgo!  It has better stats (If I remember<br>
correctly) than lucidril in its one study of 50 Alzheimers patients... <br>
<p>
If someone tries it, and writes about it, their essay will get zillions of<br>
hits (like the 85K to DXM!).  GNC (the safeway of pill stores) might start<br>
putting it in tablets in a few months.  If you essay on this please do a<br>
rigorous test... <br>

in legal nootropics. <br>

Effect of huperzine A, a novel acetylcholinesterase<br>
inhibitor, on radial maze performance in rats.<br>
<p>

Rats were trained to run in a spatial, radial arm maze using a procedure<br>
to determine two memory functions, working and reference memory. The<br>
muscarinic antagonist, not the nicotinic antagonist, impaired both working<br>
and reference memory of rats. Scopolamine (0.125, 0.15, and 0.2 mg/kg, IP,<br>
30 min before a session) significantly impaired choice accuracy in the<br>
eight-arm maze. In contrast, mecamylamine (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg) did not<br>
affect the performance.  Huperzine A (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg, IP, 30 min<br>
before testing) and physostigmine (0.3 mg/kg, IP, 20 min before testing)<br>
could reverse scopolamine-induced deficits in the task. Chronic treatment<br>
with huperzine A (0.25 mg/kg, PO, once a day) for 8 consecutive days was<br>
as potent as acute treatment on attenuating the scopolamine-induced<br>
amnesia. <br>

Huperzine A as a pretreatment candidate drug against<br>
nerve agent toxicity.<br>

<p>
Huperzine A (HUP) is a naturally-occurring, potent, reversible inhibitor<br>
of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that crosses the blood-brain barrier. To<br>
examine its ability to protect against nerve agent poisoning, HUP was<br>
administered i.p. to mice, and the s.c. LD50 of soman was determined at<br>
various time intervals after pretreatment. Results were compared to those<br>
obtained for animals treated with physostigmine. A protective ratio of<br>
approximately 2 was maintained for at least 6 hr after a single injection<br>
of HUP, without the need for any post-challenge drug therapy. By contrast,<br>
pretreatment with physostigmine increased the LD50 of soman by 1.4- to<br>
1.5-fold for only up to 90 min. The long-lasting antidotal efficacy<br>
displayed by HUP correlated with the time course of the blood-AChE<br>
inhibition. The results suggest that the protection of animals by HUP from<br>
soman poisoning was achieved by temporarily sequestering the active site<br>
region of the physiologically important AChE. <br>

AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tablet huperzine-A (Hup) in<br>
patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Using multicenter,<br>
prospective, double-blind, parallel, placebo controlled and randomized<br>
method, 50 patients were administered orally 0.2 mg (4 tablets) Hup and 53<br>
patients were given po 4 tablets of placebo bid for 8 wk. All patients<br>
were evaluated with Wechsler memory scale, Hasegawa dementia scale,<br>
mini-mental state examination scale, activity of daily living scale,<br>
treatment emergency symptom scale, and measured with BP, HR, ECG, EEG,<br>
ALT, AKP, BUN, Cr, Hb, WBC, and urine routine. RESULTS: About 58% (29/50)<br>
of patients treated with Hup showed improvements in their memory (P &lt;<br>
0.01), cognitive (P &lt; 0.01), and behavioral (P &lt; 0.01 functions. The<br>
efficacy of Hup was better than placebo (36%, 19/53) (P &lt; 0.05). No severe<br>
side effect was found. CONCLUSION: Hup is a promising drug for symptomatic<br>
treatment of Alzheimer's disease. <br>

Huperzine A ameliorates the spatial working memory<br>
impairments induced by AF64A.<br>

<p>
Huperzine A, a novel, potent, reversible, and selective<br>
acetylcholinesterase (AChE)  inhibitor has been expected to be superior to<br>
other AChE inhibitors now for the treatment of memory deficits in patients<br>
with Alzheimer's disease. We have assessed the effects of huperzine A on<br>
performance of AF64A-treated rats in the radial maze. AF64A (2 nmol per<br>
side, i.c.v.) caused significant impairment in rats' ability to perform<br>
the spatial working memory task. This behavioural impairment was<br>
associated with a significant decrease in the activity of choline<br>
acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the hippocampus. Huperzine A (0.4-0.5 mg kg-1,<br>
i.p.) significantly ameliorated the AF64A-induced memory deficit. These<br>
results suggest that AF64A is a useful agent for disrupting working memory<br>
processes by altering hippocampal cholinergic function, and such<br>
impairment can be effectively ameliorated by huperzine A. <br>

Development of natural products as drugs acting on<br>
central nervous system.<br>

We have recently studied several natural product constituents which have<br>
effects on the CNS. (1)  Tetrahydropalmatine (THP) and its analogues were<br>
isolated from Corydalis ambigua and various species of Stephania. (+)-THP<br>
and (-)-THP possess not only analgesic activity, but also exert<br>
sedative-tranquilizing and hypnotic actions. Results of receptor binding<br>
assay and their pre- and post-synaptic effects on dopaminergic system<br>
indicate that (-)-THP and (-)-stepholidine are dopamine receptor<br>
antagonists while (+)-THP is a selective dopamine depletor. (2) <br>
3-Acetylaconitine (AAC) is an alkaloid isolated from Aconitum flavum. The<br>
relative potency of analgesic action of AAC was 5.1-35.6 and 1250-3912<br>
times that of morphine and aspirin, respectively. The analgesic effect of<br>
AAC was not antagonized by naloxone, but was eliminated by reserpine. In<br>
monkeys, after AAC was injected for 92 days, no abstinence syndrome was<br>
seen after sudden AAC withdrawal or when challenged with nalorphine. (3)<br>
Huperzine A (Hup-A)  is an alkaloid isolated from Huperzia serrata which<br>
was found to be a selective ChE inhibitor and could improve learning and<br>
retrieval processes. Preliminary clinical studies showed that Hup-A<br>
improve short- and long-term memory in patients of cerebral<br>
arteriosclerosis with memory impairment. (4)  Ranamargarin is a new<br>
tetradecapeptide isolated from the skin of the Chinese frog Rana<br>
margaratae.  This peptide may mainly act on NK-1 receptor. <br>

[Effects of huperzine A on electroencephalography power<br>

<p>
Huperzine A (Hup-A) is a new alkaloid extracted from Huperzia serata in<br>
China. The effects of Hup-A on learning and memory are superior to those<br>
of physostigmine (Phys). The purpose of this paper is to observe the<br>
effects of Hup-A on EEG and EEG power spectrum in rabbits with<br>
micro-computer analysis. Hup-A 0.1 mg/kg iv in conscious rabbits produced,<br>
after 0.5 min, an alert EEG pattern, which showed decreases of lower<br>
frequency components and the total EEG power in cortical area, and the<br>
dominant frequency transferred from delta rhythm to theta rhythm in<br>
hippocampus. The same effects were seen with Phys 0.1 mg/kg. Scopolamine<br>
(Scop, 0.2 mg/kg iv)  reversed significantly these effects of Hup-A (10<br>
micrograms/rabbit, icv), but Scop butylbromide (0.4 mg/kg, iv) which can<br>
not pass the blood-brain barrier did not. Hup-A 0.2 mg/kg iv or Phys 0.3<br>
mg/kg iv antagonized the EEG effects of Scop 0.3 mg/kg iv. The results<br>
indicate that the effects of Hup-A are closely related to the action on<br>
the central cholinergic system. <br>

The supplement will contain Huperzine A at a level of 50 micrograms in a<br>
tablet or capsule, with a suggestion to take once per day, the firm said<br>
in an Aug. 25 letter, placed on the public record after the 75-day<br>
premarket notification period required under the Dietary Supplement Health<br>
