Now, I know this isn't the most directly "extropian" topic... In many ways <br>
what the U.S. President does or doesn't do is irrelevant...<br>
<p>
&lt;RANT&gt;<br>
<p>
Am I the only one pissed off by the apparent fact that so many<br>
people want to hang him if it turns out he had an affair?  I mean, come on! I<br>
saw one quote from one of the lawyers who, while not rushing to judgement about<br>
the veracity of the claims, said that if the claims were true, it would mean<br>
that the president is a misogynist.<br>
<p>
On what planet?<br>
<p>
Did anyone else ever see an obscure movie called "Eating the Rich"?  Among a<br>
variety of strange plotlines, there is the story of a high-ranking Government<br>
Official who gets trapped in a sex scandal based on having had an extramarital<br>
affair.  The person who sets him up hopes, of course, that this will ruin the <br>
Official and force him from office.  Except in that story, the trap backfires.<br>
The Official's popularity soars like never before, as the Tabloids run story <br>
after story about how the Official "gets his little bit on the side."<br>
<p>
I've always loved that line, and wish it were more like that in this country.<br>
Does anyone, in this day and age, actually believe that a guy like Clinton is <br>
a wife-loving family man?  That he could possibly resist the allure of <br>
sex brought by the mystique of being powerful?  Of course not. <br>
<p>
But once it's out in the open, well, then we'd better hang him, eh?  <br>
<p>
&lt;/RANT&gt;<br>
<p>
Sorry for taking up bandwidth with nothing more than a complaint.<br>
