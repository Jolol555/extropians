Cannabioids are interesting chemicals, although I think they have very<br>
limited transhuman applications. The known receptors are found mainly<br>
in the basal ganglia, the cerebellum and especially the<br>
hippocampus. It seems that the cannabioids have an overall inhibitory<br>
effect on the hippocampus, leading to memory impairments (Drew et al<br>
1980). In fact, an antagonist has shown nootropic effects by improving<br>
memory (Terranova 1996). This, coupled with the decrease in motivation<br>
(a serotonin inhibition effect?) doesn't suggest them as very useful<br>
for a transhuman other than as chemical entertainment.<br>

&lt;Neuroscientist speculation mode on&gt; It is interesting to speculate<br>
that the feelings of meaningfulness and profound insights are related<br>
to the temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome. And also the model that<br>
hippocampal region CA1 does novelty/familiarity detection of<br>
experiences (see for example "Encoding and Retrieval of Episodic<br>
Memories: Role of Cholinergic and GABAergic Modulation in the<br>
Huippocampus" by Michael E. Hasselmo, Bradley P. Wyble and Gene<br>
V. Wallenstein in Hippocampus 6:693-708 (1996)). Is marijuana use<br>
linked to feelings of Deja vu or its opposite? If this holds, it could<br>
mess up the familiarity/novelty detection systems, making the user<br>
think that a new experience was familiar or an old experience fresh<br>
and new.  &lt;Neuroscientist speculation mode on&gt;<br>

Effects of hippocampal brain damage on auditory and visual recent<br>
memory: comparison with marijuana-intoxicated subjects.<br>
<p>
Biol Psychiatry 1980 Dec;15(6):841-858 <br>
Drew WG, Weet CR, De Rossett SE, Batt JR<br>
<p>
A battery of tests clinically employed for the estimation of auditory<br>
and visual recent memory dysfunction was administered to eight<br>
subjects having circumscribed damage to the temporal lobe.  It was<br>
hypothesized that the performance of subjects with temporal lobe<br>
lesions would qualitatively resemble that of subjects intoxicated with<br>
marijuana. Where comparisons could be made, the performance of these<br>
"temporal lobe" patients paralleled the performance of subjects<br>
acutely intoxicated with known doses of delta 9-THC. Results are<br>
discussed in terms of cannabinoid actions on hippocampal functioning<br>
and, in general, support the hypothesis that the action of marijuana<br>
in the brain may focus in the hippocampal region and produce<br>
behavioral changes similar to that resulting from traumatic injury or<br>
removal of the region.<br>

Improvement of memory in rodents by the selective CB1<br>
cannabinoid receptor antagonist, SR 141716.<br>

Social short-term memory in rodents is based on the recognition of a<br>
juvenile by an adult conspecific when the juvenile is presented on two<br>
successive occasions. Cannabimimetics are claimed to induce memory<br>
deficits in both humans and animals. In the brain, they mainly bind to<br>
CB1 receptors for which anandamide is a purported endogenous<br>
ligand. SR 141716, a specific antagonist of CB1 receptors,<br>
dose-dependently reverses biochemical and pharmacological effects of<br>
cannabimimetics. More particularly, it antagonizes the inhibition of<br>
hippocampal long-term potentiation induced by WIN 55,212-2 and<br>
anandamide, and it increases arousal when given alone. The present<br>
experiments study the ability of SR 141716 (from 0.03 to 3 mg/kg SC)<br>
to facilitate short-term olfactory memory in the social recognition<br>
test in rodents. SR 141716 improved social recognition in a long<br>
intertrial paradigm with a threshold dose of 0.1 mg/kg SC. At 1 mg/kg,<br>
it antagonized the memory disturbance elicited by retroactive<br>
inhibition. Scopolamine (0.06 mg/kg IP) partially reversed its<br>
memory-enhancing effect. Moreover, SR 141716 reduced memory deficit in<br>
aged rats (0.03-0.1 mg/kg) and mice (0.3-1 mg/kg). As SR 141716 is not<br>
known to exhibit any pharmacological activity which is not mediated by<br>
CB1 receptors, the results strongly support the concept that blockade<br>
of CB1 receptors plays an important role in consolidation of<br>
short-term memory in rodents and suggest there may be a role for an<br>
endogenous cannabinoid agonist tone (anandaminergic) in forgetting.<br>
