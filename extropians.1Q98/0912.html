There really should be some kind of Extropian investor mailing<br>
list. I know that a lot of us are working on generating capital,<br>
and there likely could be a lot of discussion as to how to<br>
use it once we acquire it.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the research is to happen according to the ideas stated in this</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As a more conventional approach, we should be able to find biotech startup</i><br>

<i>&gt; Some should be acceptable to list members. Nothing stops us from</i><br>
