<p>
Actually, Extropy is about making life more complex, intelligent,<br>
powerful and full of more opportunity.  Rational thought is simply a tool<br>
that Extropians use, when appropriate, to achieve their goals of<br>
increasing extropy in the world.<br>
<p>
Yak Wax goes on to question what rational reason there is against "human<br>
culling, genocide or general murder".  At the core, this is simply a<br>
question about the merits of various courses of action.  We have a huge<br>
number of options available to us every day.  Many of those options<br>
include killing other people and hurting other people as well as helping<br>
other people or ignoring other people or whatever.  To evaluate the<br>
merits of these options they must be considered in terms of one's short<br>
and long-term goals.  If someone's goal in life is to kill as many people<br>
as possible, then it is rational for them to do things which result in<br>
the death of many people.  If one's goal is to help as many people as<br>
possible live as long as possible, it would be rational to take action<br>
which results in that goal.  Whether an action is rational or not depends<br>
on the goals of the one choosing.<br>
<p>
Rationality, by itself, with no goal-oriented context, says nothing about<br>
what courses of action we "should" take.  However, Extropians have the<br>
goal of increasing extropy in the world, and even though "extropy" is<br>
somewhat vaguely defined, many types of actions, especially ones which<br>
destroy intelligent systems or impede the progress of life into more<br>
intelligence and complexity, are considered non-extropian, and it would<br>
be irrational for an Extropian to carry out these actions or make them<br>
significantly more likely to occur.  Entropic decisions are irrational<br>
*only* because they conflict with their goal of increasing extropy.<br>
<p>
Rationality can be used to evaluate decisions in terms of goals, but it<br>
cannot generate the goals themselves.<br>
<p>
No system of ethics is rational *in and of itself*; however if a system<br>
of ethics consistently guides the actions of an extropian to make more<br>
extropy in the world, then it is rational *for that particular person* to<br>
follow *that particular ethical system*.  It is unlikely that there is a<br>
"one best" ethical system that is rational for everyone to follow.  The<br>
only way this could be so is if every person had the same goals.<br>
<p>
For the rational, morality and ethics are simply behavioral strategies<br>
for accomplishing their goals in a world of other people.  If your way of<br>
treating others consistently gets you what you want, then your personal<br>
systems of morality and ethics is rational *for you*.<br>
