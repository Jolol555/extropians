After you've made it safely to the finish line you can still uplift the rest,<br>
*if you so desire*. Acts of benevolence are rooted in self-interest because<br>
they make you feel good and/or are an investment (what comes around goes<br>
around). Nothing wrong with that, btw, the ones you help still get the same<br>
benefit. Btw, isn't "enlightened self-interest" (egoism with foresight ;) one of<br>
the extropian values?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, your argument about crisis driving solutions is indeed a</i><br>
<i>&gt; characteristic of human action patterns. I suggest it support's de Bono's</i><br>
<i>&gt; rubric that "the primary purpose of thinking [in terms of the mass of</i><br>
<i>&gt; humanity--MMB] is to abolish thinking [and get back to the comfort zone</i><br>
<i>&gt; ASAP--MMB]".</i><br>
So we have no disagreement?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Trotsky and many terrorcrats agree. That doesn't make you wrong, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt; does mean that you should take a close look at who your eschatological</i><br>
<i>&gt; bedfellows are.</i><br>
Well, if some people with bad reputations agree, so be it. I don't condone some<br>
of the other beliefs of the likes of Trotsky, but I *am* interested in the way<br>
things<br>
are, no matter how sad or disgusting the truth is. If Stalin says "blood is red" I'm<br>
not going to disagree just because I don't like him as a person. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Me, I plan to develop the field of _Elective_ Eschatology. :)</i><br>
Which is?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Very well: I declare that my well-being is influenced positively by</i><br>
<i>&gt; increased diversity in my environment. Prove to me that I err. :)</i><br>
This statement doesn't contradict any of my claims, so I don't see<br>
any point in investigating your true feelings ;) Your highest goal is<br>
well-being. For some (irrelevant to this discussion) reason you (claim<br>
to) get positive stimulation from more diversity. Consequently, you<br>
will try to prevent the loss of diversity and/or try to increase diversity.<br>
Regardless of the broader implications, your motivation is basically<br>
the same as that for eating tasty food: it makes you feel good.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I would argue that everything else is *not* a tool--it is _raw materials_;</i><br>
<i>&gt; but some of it is reserves, and some of those are raw material for</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiences that I can't have if it is destroyed (the Grand Canyon, Mount</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fuji, Jack Russell Terrier puppies, pet ferrets, potential lovers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Barringer Meteor Crater, my wonderful nieces and nephews, etc. etc.).</i><br>
I think we mean basically the same thing; whether you call it "tool", "raw<br>
material", "resource" etc, it all means "stuff that allows you to reach certain<br>
goals (staying alive &amp; feeling ok)". I fully agree with you that it would be a <br>
shame to lose *certain* aspects of diversity, including nature. My point was <br>
that many of these things, among which biodiversity, are *not crucial to our <br>
survival*, certainly not once we've entered "singularity" (whatever it may be).<br>
Also, we can only *guess* what their value is to future intelligences (hopefully<br>
us ;) since we can only guess at how hyperminds think. <br>
<p>
Apart from this, I don't beleive there will be substancial damage to the world's<br>
(bio) diversity before we reach techno-ascencion, so it's more of a theoretical<br>
question. Once uploaded, you can virtually store/modify/delete all species of<br>
earth, and then some. Extinct species can (almost certainly) be re-created from<br>
the existing genepool and some general info. Piece of cake for a Jupiter brain ;)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; If everything else is a tool, then all you are is a user.</i><br>
Is that a dirty word?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Go ahead, prove I'm wrong. :)</i><br>
Only if you can prove *me* wrong first ;)<br>
 <br>
P.s: things like the HIV virus and Jeffrey Dahmer are extra diversity too, but<br>
surely you don't want them around too much? Therefore, more diversity is not<br>
always good.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Peace,</i><br>
Same to you. <br>
