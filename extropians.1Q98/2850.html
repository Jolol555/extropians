The issue of how fertilized human eggs should be treated was raised<br>
recently on this list. There is an interesting paragraph about this topic<br>
in a book review at the  HMS Beagle web site. Below is the relevant<br>
excerpt. Of course, there is still room for disagreement with the viewpoint<br>
presented. <br>

Remaking Eden Cloning and Beyond in a Brave New World<br>
by Lee M. Silver<br>
Avon Books, 1997<br>
<p>
Begin excerpt from book review<br>
<p>
By combining some underappreciated biology with common sense, he also<br>
analyzes the assumptions underlying the claim that a fertilized human egg<br>
deserves special status based on its potential for developing into a human<br>
being. For example, the assertion that a unique genetic identity is created<br>
at conception is undermined by the fact that the maternal and paternal<br>
pronuclei don't fuse until the two-cell stage of development. Moreover, for<br>
about two weeks after fertilization, each of the individual cells of the<br>
embryo has the potential to give rise to a complete and distinct developing<br>
embryo. Despite the acknowledged potency of each of these cells, their lost<br>
potential is not mourned when one of them is plucked off from an early<br>
embryo in order to carry out prenatal genetic diagnosis. Finally, since<br>
cloning by nuclear transfer allows for the creation of a new embryo from<br>
any somatic cell in the absence of conception, the act of conferring<br>
respect or elevated status on biological potential is not supported, Silver<br>
argues, by the modern facts of human reproduction. <br>
