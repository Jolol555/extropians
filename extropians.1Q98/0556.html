Um, minor objection: there is absolute proof that witches exist.<br>
<p>
Of course, the witches don't claim that the common <br>
Christian-propaganda-against-nonChristian image of witches bears any <br>
relation to real witches; for that matter, not even many Christians <br>
make such a ridiculous claim.<br>
<p>
(Although a lot of witches *do* have fun with that parody.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That a lot of people believes something, and has been believing it for a</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why do those of us that doesn't believe in a gods existence, have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; prove that he doesn't exsist? The evidence is such that a case held in</i><br>

<p>
Sorry, but you are quite mistaken on the latter claim.  <br>
<p>
First, quite a few western courts are obligated by law to acknowledge <br>
the existence of some specific God; and quite a few others are <br>
legally bound against taking a position on the subject.<br>
<p>
Second, I can't think of a sort of court case where a blanket <br>
judgement against the existence of any god would be appropriate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; People who makes a claim holds the burden of proof.</i><br>
<p>
Isn't "there is no god" a claim?<br>
<p>
"I am not aware of any evidence of a god and I don't see any <br>
particular need for one" -- the agnostic position -- is merely an <br>
observation.  But it does NOT assert that there is no god.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Why doesn't this</i><br>
<i>&gt; work for religion, only for everything else?</i><br>
<p>
My opinion is that THOSE WHO WISH OTHERS TO ACCEPT A CLAIM bear a <br>
burden of proof.  That would include the evangelical theists, the <br>
evangelical atheists, and the evangelical agnostic (I have never <br>
encountered one of the latter - it seems a truly odd position to me). <br>
 But it would not include the non-evangelical theist or the <br>
non-evangelical atheist.<br>
