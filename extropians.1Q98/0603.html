Erik Moeller writes<br>
: Who sells the weapons? The government? Who earns money when a war has<br>
: started? The government?<br>
<p>
Not money: power.  The state always expands during wartime,<br>
and rarely if ever retreats afterward to its former size.<br>
("War is the health of the state.")<br>
<p>
To blame "Businessmen" for wars, you must ignore the fact that MOST<br>
of them, on either side, LOSE money in wartime.<br>
<p>
: Who profits from a tax policy which burdens the majority and favours<br>
: the minority? The minority, of course. Which is not the government.<br>
<p>
Hah!  Government is the most favored minority of all!<br>
<p>
: John Clark, one of the more intelligent free market advisors, would<br>
: answer: "If you remove governments, all this corruption will disappear<br>
: and the free market will bring up only efficient companies." The problem<br>
: is that by removing government, you only remove a cover under which the<br>
: true power elite hides. The power structures remain - and before you can<br>
: say "Jebediah", your country will be ruled directly by big enterprises.<br>
<p>
Evidence?<br>
<p>
If you're right, wouldn't it be better in some ways to have the beast<br>
made naked, so all can see its true nature?<br>
<p>
: Luddism is a perfectly understandable reaction in capitalism. Because in<br>
: a capitalist society, progress in production efficiency will often hurt<br>
: the population. The more efficient you are, the less workers you need.<br>
: More unemployment. 4,5 million registered in Germany today, and rising.<br>
<p>
So why did employment in the Nottingham textile industry (origin of the<br>
term "Luddite") increase with mechanization?<br>
<p>
Of course there are no state regulatory barriers to employment,<br>
only reactionary "libertarians" believe that, right?<br>
<p>
: About military: Why do you think we have it? Because some bums in the<br>
: government think we need it to defend our country?<br>
<p>
Because military forces have been around longer than anyone can remember,<br>
and few dare question their necessity?  I dunno, you tell us.<br>
<p>
: Most extropians despise governments, but at the same time, they are the<br>
: perfect democrats. Because they really believe that democracy works the<br>
: way it is intended to work - they just think that this way is not right.<br>
<p>
Well, let's have a show of hands.  How many here believe there's no fraud<br>
in democracy as it is, in your respective city or country?<br>

: Ever heard about the NSA? That's not a product of the free market,<br>
: but it's a structure needed in all governments (and the free market<br>
: is just a new form of dictatorship).<br>
<p>
Wow man, that's so cosmic, y'know?  Have another toke.<br>
<p>
: &gt; "It's a far easier thing to have a firm anchor in ignorance than out<br>
: &gt; to set on the troubled seas of thought."<br>
:<br>
: And many extropians seem to prefer the easy way.<br>
<p>
Love you too.<br>
