Exactly!  The fact that a single flower in a low diversity environment <br>
needs at least two other species for its survival, is testament to what <br>
I am driving at.  Don't forget, that those two species need other <br>
organisms to survive which in turn need others, which in turn need <br>
others.....are you getting the picture now?<br>
<p>
I strongly encourage you to read at least one good book on ecology, <br>
population ecology and/or biodiversity before we continue this debate <br>
any further.  It's as if we are arguing finer points within Quantum <br>
Cosmology, without you having a basic understanding of how gravity <br>
works.  Besides, if in the end you still disagree with me, at least you <br>
walk away with a fuller understanding of the most complex systems in the <br>
known universe.<br>
<p>
