From: <a href="http://www.massquantities.com/alc.html">http://www.massquantities.com/alc.html</a> <br>
<p>
"In lab studies ALC (Acetyl L-Carnitine) dramatically <br>
improved testosterone levels in rats that were exposed <br>
to physical stress.Typically, after a workout, your testosterone <br>
levels plummet and you experience a spike in cortisol<br>
production. New research shows that in addition to<br>
eliminating the stress induced drop in testosterone,<br>
ALC actually reduces cortisol levels as well.<br>
<p>
Even if ALC can't make you balloon up to 375 lb,<br>
there's undeniable evidence that it does positively<br>
affects testosterone levels--a condition which may lead<br>
to improved muscle growth.<br>
<p>
On page 156 of Febuary 1997 issue of MM2K you<br>
can read all about ALC's bodybuilding applications in<br>
Michael Mooney's "Medibolics" column. Mooney<br>
recommends 2000 mg a day as an effective dose for a<br>
bodybuilder."<br>
<p>
Ok, this is a commercial site, so the effects might be<br>
exaggerated a bit, but it seems to match my personal<br>
experiences. The increase in testosterone would explain<br>
the "agressive (pumped-up) feeling" and the increased mucle <br>
firmness you get when taking larger amounts (4-8 300 mg pills <br>
dayly in my case) of carnitine. It "brings out the male in you",<br>
so to speak. Also, fat seems to melt away and turn into muscle<br>
(I gained approx 3 kilos since I began using the carnitine). As soon<br>
as I stop using it the muscles loose their firmness, and the fat<br>
comes back. Surely, this is more than just placebo effect. <br>
Note: I have been prescribed carnitine on an experimental basis to<br>
reduce (chronical) fatigue, memory- and concentration problems<br>
and unexplained (dramatic) weight loss. It has indeed helped to<br>
reduce these problems, but as a sort of bonus it also increased<br>
muscle firmness/mass and general assertiveness (although the<br>
results may vary day by day). Nobody told me I could expect these<br>
last two effects, so it can't be a case of "expectation foils perception".<br>
Anyway, I have been using the stuff for three months or so without <br>
any *negative* side-effects. I warmly recommend it to anyone who<br>
wants to improve his general condition. Of course results may vary,<br>
but it won't hurt to try. <br>
<p>
The indications for Carnitene TM, from Sigma Tau (R) - Italy <br>
--fast deterioration of muscle function<br>
--problems with the central nervous system<br>
--the build-up of fat in muscle tissues or other tissues<br>
