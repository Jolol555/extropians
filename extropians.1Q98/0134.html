"Why would a software user want to load and run software with an unknown<br>
number of modifications, all of which they must pay for individually,<br>
each<br>
time they use the software (if I properly understand your idea)?  How<br>
would a business budget for such an escalating, never ending expense."<br>
<p>
Keep in mind that most users would use software which had already been<br>
tested by companies which do that.  If a company gives its clients access<br>
to software which is of poor quality, they will not get as much business<br>
as those who offer higher quality software.  Companies will develop a<br>
reputation for selecting good software and rating software accurately.<br>
<p>
Also keep in mind that software packages are competing with other ones,<br>
and the users know what it is likely to cost before they use any<br>
software.  As people modify software components and add components, most<br>
likely the cost to run any individual component in that package will drop<br>
slightly in order to make the whole software package competitive with<br>
other software.  Pricing on software will fluctuate automatically<br>
according to the market.  <br>
<p>
Howard goes on to ask:<br>
<p>
"I have enough trouble supporting the software I have now. How would I<br>
fix and maintain software from a thousand different undocumented sources<br>
that work together in unpredictable (by me) ways?"<br>
<p>
There is no reason you have to fix and maintain software from a thousand<br>
different undocumented sources.  You can always keep a version that you<br>
wrote and understand and keep updating it whenever you want.  You can<br>
either forbid any one else from modifying it, let others modify it all<br>
they want while you still take care of and market your own version, or<br>
think of something else creative to do regarding your software.  <br>
<p>
There will be many, many choices for software developers.  And for those<br>
who write software to make money, it will be extremely competitive, and<br>
people will come up with many devious and clever strategies to make their<br>
money.  And some of those strategies will include allowing complete<br>
strangers to modify their software at will, to let their software go,<br>
with the hope that many others will find it worth their time to make the<br>
software more valuable and eventually cash in on their added value.<br>
<p>
The ways software will be produced in the future will be much more<br>
diverse than they are now.  Human cleverness will produce many<br>
unpredictable strategies for making software and money.  It's difficult<br>
to predict because we don't know about all the revolutionary, brilliant<br>
ideas the geniuses and other highly intelligent people have yet to come<br>
up with.  Whatever is done, I think we will all be very surprised.  And<br>
likely very pleased.  <br>
