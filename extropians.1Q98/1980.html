--My thoughts on the subject are fairly simple-minded.  <br>
<p>
As you're uploading, and for the moment when the upload is completed, <br>
the copy <br>
IS you.  The nanosecond you have a dissimilar experience from the copy, <br>
you <br>
are separate entities.  <br>
<p>
So in this case,  the "you" and "someone else" are both correct, <br>
depending on <br>
the time frame.  <br>
<p>
And yes,  I do believe this was discussed earlier with a 'jumping into a<br>
volcano' <br>
dialogue on cloning.  I could be wrong.<br>
