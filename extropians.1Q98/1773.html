 While this index was originally developed by the mathematician John Baez to<br>
apply specifically to individuals with wild extapolations (or just plain<br>
abandonement) of generally accepted theories in physics, I think several of its<br>
provisions could be taken to heart on this list.<br>
<p>
<p>
   THE CRACKPOT INDEX<br>
      A simple method for rating potentially<br>
      revolutionary contributions to physics.<br>
<p>
1) A -5 point starting credit.<br>
2) 1 point for every statement that is widely agreed on to be false.<br>
3) 2 points for every statement that is clearly vacuous.<br>
4) 3 points for every statement that is logically inconsistent.<br>
5) 5 points for each such statement that is adhered to despite careful<br>
correction.<br>
6) 5 points for using a thought experiment that contradicts the results<br>
of a widely accepted real experiment.<br>
7) 5 points for each word in all capital letters (except for those<br>
with defective keyboards).<br>
8) 10 points for each claim that quantum mechanics is fundamentally<br>
misguided (without good evidence).<br>
9) 10 points for each favorable comparison of oneself to Einstein, or<br>
claim that special or general relativity are fundamentally misguided<br>
(without good evidence).<br>
10) 10 points for pointing out that one has gone to school, as if this<br>
were evidence of sanity.<br>
11) 20 points for suggesting that you deserve a Nobel prize.<br>
12) 20 points for each favorable comparison of oneself to Newton or<br>
claim that classical mechanics is fundamentally misguided (without<br>
evidence).<br>
13) 20 points for every use of science fiction works or myths as if<br>
they were fact.<br>
14) 20 points for defending yourself by bringing up (real or imagined)<br>
ridicule accorded to ones past theories.<br>
15) 30 points for each favorable comparison of oneself to Galileo,<br>
claims that the Inquisition is hard at work on ones case, etc..<br>
16) 30 points for claiming that when ones theory is finally appreciated,<br>
present-day science will be seen as the sham it truly is.<br>
17) 30 points for claiming that the "scientific establishment" is<br>
engaged in a "conspiracy" to prevent ones work from gaining its<br>
well-deserved fame, or suchlike.<br>
18) 40 points for claiming one has a revolutionary theory but<br>
giving no concrete testable predictions.<br>
