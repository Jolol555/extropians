As I see it, the abortion debate has very little to do with the value of life<br>
or what it is to be human.  Its purely about individual freedom.  If the<br>
individual freedom of people were not at stake there the abortion debate would<br>
be less robust by several orders of magnitude.  An illustrative example: If you<br>
polled 100 people from both sides of the abortion issue they would probably all<br>
agree that the unnecessary death of children after birth should be avoided at<br>
all costs.  There is little dispute of the value of life after birth.  Yet<br>
40,000 children die each day from hunger.  The developed world drops a virtual<br>
Hiroshima bomb on the Third World every two days in the form of depravity.  In<br>
the last three years the number of children that have died from starvation in<br>
the Third World outnumber the number of abortions since the Roe v. Wade<br>
decision.<br>
<p>
If we're talking about the value of life, the pro-life crew should view the<br>
abortion issue as ancillary to the world hunger issue.  The key difference is<br>
there is not an individual freedom issue attached to the world hunger issue.<br>
The foundation of the pro-choice movement is individual freedom.  They view<br>
this issue as tantamount.  So while it may make the issue appear noble and<br>
dramatic to view it as a debate as to what is human, we've proven time and<br>
again that even if we make the determination that a group is human we still<br>
have little problem with subjecting that group to inhuman conditions for our<br>
own benefit.<br>
<p>
What does all this mean?  Simply that the distinction of someone or some group<br>
as human does not guarantee they will be treated like humans.  We've<br>
rationalized such treatment of "other" groups (slaves, Jews, Muslims,<br>
Christians, laypersons) in the past based on viewing of particular group as<br>
less than human or at least less profound than we are (the vilest use of<br>
Darwinian theory).<br>
<p>
I believe this issue will (and perhaps has already) arise in the future as the<br>
utility of a large portion of the human population will be marginalized to<br>
virtually zero.  This marginalization might occur through the technologies such<br>
as nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and so on.  Drexler wondered about<br>
this situation (created by the establishment of a robust molecular<br>
nanotechnology) but did not speculate about how it might play out.  What<br>
happens when large metaorganisms (governments) no longer need large portions of<br>
their populace to function?  What happens when these metaorganisms determine<br>
they can function more competitively if it did not have to allocate (waste)<br>
resources on this surplus and useless human baggage?  Of course, the<br>
metaorganism will act through its instutitions (legal, social, military,<br>
political) its society to explore ways to deal with these problems.  The<br>
significant question becomes: What happens when the "lives" of metaorganisms<br>
come in direct conflict with the lives of large portions of the human<br>
population?<br>
<p>
We've set a dangerous precedent.  Historically, we've found it easy to<br>
marginalize different groups in the interest of greater society.  But<br>
metaorganisms have always needed most of its populace (and even wanted to<br>
increase its populace) to propser.  A unique circumstance may loom in the<br>
future where we are not needed.  This also becomes an issue for transhumans.<br>
<p>
Transhuman concepts of human enhancement  may help us or harm us.  A<br>
superintelligent human might be able to do the work of several regular human<br>
scientists or engineers.  Or a new "arms" race might be a transhuman race<br>
between governments, how fast and effectively can a government take its<br>
currently surplus/useless populace and enhance them to a level that makes them<br>
valuable may be new competitive test.<br>
<p>
I would appreciate people's insights into these issues and into faults in my<br>
extrapolations.<br>
