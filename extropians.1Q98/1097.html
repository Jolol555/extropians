<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, I know this isn't the most directly "extropian" topic... In many ways </i><br>
<i>&gt; what the U.S. President does or doesn't do is irrelevant...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;RANT&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Am I the only one pissed off by the apparent fact that so many</i><br>
<i>&gt; people want to hang him if it turns out he had an affair?  I mean, come on! I</i><br>
<i>&gt; saw one quote from one of the lawyers who, while not rushing to judgement about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the veracity of the claims, said that if the claims were true, it would mean</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the president is a misogynist.</i><br>
<p>
I could care less about what Clinton's sexual history is. It has little or no<br>
effect on his being able to run the country. His first term looked kinda <br>
amatuerish in places, but though I'd have rather had Dole, he'd managed to <br>
mostly get it together in the second term (Noteably, bringing in Albright as<br>
Secretary of State dramatically improved the handling of foreign policy).<br>
That said, there are two points that have to be made. First and by far the <br>
most important, is that the real question is whether or not he and Vernon<br>
Jordan asked someone to commit perjury. That's a felony. Now, many of us on<br>
this list don't like a lot of things about our government and legal system<br>
(myself included), but this man is the leader and symbol of that system, and<br>
if it's ok for him to do that, what does it say for the validity of that<br>
system?<br>
I remember my complete disgust when Mitchell, during Watergate said with a <br>
straight face to the House committee "Obeying the law, and upholding the <br>
constitution would have hurt us politically.". That was the Attorney General<br>
of the United States saying that. That was incredible hypocrisy, and so is this if it turns out to be true.<br>
<p>
If the president was soliciting perjury, then it IS a big deal.<br>
<p>
The second is only a minor quibble. If he indeed did have an affair with<br>
Lewinsky (as yet unproven, and not particularly reprehensible, save for any <br>
effect on his family), he might have shown a little more restraint<br>
during his time in office, given the PR problems he's had with allegations<br>
in the past. I think the sexual standards the country tries to impose on<br>
officials are ridiculous, but that's a fact of political life at the moment.<br>
Tempting fate that way is not good judgement.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; But once it's out in the open, well, then we'd better hang him, eh?  </i><br>
<p>
If it's getting someone to lie under oath that's getting out in the open,<br>
then he has to face charges just like any of the rest of us would. <br>
And saying that doing that is just "business as usual" is IMHO just admitting<br>
the the process has failed.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sorry for taking up bandwidth with nothing more than a complaint.</i><br>
<p>
No prob. I like the political discussions even more than the philosophical <br>
ones. (grin)<br>
