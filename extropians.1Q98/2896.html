<i>&gt; &gt; Ah, so you are referring to a central banking</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; is an accurate assessment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That would be one central point, but I was including other components</i><br>
<i>&gt; of free-market systems.</i><br>
<p>
True, but few others have such measurable, direct influence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; However, it is not apparent that this is a 'bad'</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thing, at least not currently.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's what we've got, so it can't be that bad.</i><br>
<p>
No its not. Possibly the most stable major system in the world. However, I<br>
still curdle when I hear Mr Greenspan make some off the cuff remark and<br>
the market reels in one direction or another in response. That is a bit<br>
much authority, no matter how well he has demonstrated his competence to<br>
weild it. Of course, most of this authority is merely intangible<br>
psychological power, sort of a cult of personality that has developed as a<br>
result of his good stewardship.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As the 1920's demonstrated, failing to impose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; any form of negative feedback on a system</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will cause that system to quickly cycleout</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of control as any competent engineer can tell</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you (like oversteer on a truck steering system).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'Out of control' isn't always such a 'bad' thing.  BTW, roads are also</i><br>
<i>&gt; centralist.</i><br>
<p>
Currently, for the most part. In many states there are currently<br>
privatization proposals for the major highways. I recall that one was<br>
afoot a few years ago in Washington State. Recall that the original roads<br>
in America were, in fact, private concerns.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The system I was 'proposing' (yet another open network) doesn't really</i><br>
<i>&gt; have "negative feedback" only positive feedback.  I don't see how this</i><br>
<i>&gt; can go 'out of control', since it has no specific place to go in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; first place.</i><br>
<p>
Thats my point. Any system with only positive feedback will tend to cycle<br>
out of control. "out of control" being economic cycles that, over time,<br>
occilate into things like huge Boom and Bust cycles. Contrary to the<br>
statements of Mr. Tal'se'hedrin, the boom of the 1920's and the Great<br>
Depression were not caused by the Reserve system, as that system was not<br>
in place until the Depression was well underway, though it is<br>
understandable that with the pathetic economic knowledge of the time that<br>
the Reserve systems initial steps to fix things only served to make things<br>
worse. Since up to that point, economists were only familiar with measures<br>
that induced positive feedback, it is natural that their first steps to<br>
fix things made them worse, much like primitive western medicine. The<br>
1920-1940 boom/bust cycle was the culmination of economic policies that<br>
had been feeding on one another since the end of the civil war. Also<br>
contrary to a previous poster's claims, the booms and busts of pre Reserve<br>
decades, while shorter, were much more severe. The busts of the 1880's and<br>
90's frequently put the majority of banks in existence out of business<br>
permanently. With the non-existence of requirements for corporate<br>
reporting, the stock market was frequently nothing but a great con game.<br>
One of the scandals that fed the nervousness that caused the 1929 Crash<br>
was the discovery of a large number of corporations which were nothing but<br>
paper shells, in the style of the recent BRE-X scandal that hit the<br>
Vancouver Exchange.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; [snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This sort of technology will also apply to your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; proposals for "One True Open Network", in that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you will not need to keep constant surveillance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; everyone.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I wouldn't call it "surveillance" because the information is recorded</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the people for their own benefit.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, like Mr. Halperin's devices from _The First Immortal_?<br>
