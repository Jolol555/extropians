<i>&gt; &gt; I've played around with a animated planner, </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This sounds like great fun! What program was it?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
See other thread.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;What I would like is a molecular film that acts as a cellular</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;automaton. Maybe we could use the microtubule units?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; What for?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Fun. Aesthethics. I like CAs :-)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
So do I, but what I have in mind are the aesthetics of providing useful<br>
<p>
products and making lotsa dough in the process.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; How small a unit cell? How many (how few, actually)?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Is there a market for this that cannot be filled with projected</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Si 'von Neumann' chips?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It would likely be significantly faster and denser than the chips. And</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; if we could tune the transition rules, then we could get lattice gas</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; dynamics with a wonderful resolution,</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
It would still be a 2D gas model, with a limited market. The size and<br>
<p>
number<br>
<p>
of cells to produce a useful device is the question. Would the amount of<br>
<p>
area<br>
<p>
needed to implement a gate, for instance, be less than the area of a<br>
<p>
dedicated<br>
<p>
hardware gate. Could it run as fast?  Bear in mind this kind of gate is <br>
<p>
approaching the molecular scale- a couple papers on this at the 5th<br>
<p>
Foresight <br>
<p>
conference.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; or make universal computations</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; for real. Or just run the greatest Game of Life ever.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; What good is a microtubule? It has to be in water, no?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think so. Normally the units form a cylinder, with a helical tiling</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; of the subunits (and some interesting stability properties; they are</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; dynamical structures, constantly being formed and dissolved at the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ends). The fun thing is that it is possible that the units flip</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; around, acting as a cellular automaton which can have all sorts of</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; dynamics.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Really? Maybe there is some biochemical analog of the rule table?<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Any other ideas for thin-film, nearly nanotech products?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What about using reaction-diffusion dynamics to create complex local</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; strucures? That might be useful to maximizing catalytic efficiency,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; adapting to changes in the environment or changing color.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
    Hmmm, maybe a chemically-powered display for laptops, clothes, etc.<br>
<p>
This might be much more efficient than electrically powered (battery). <br>
<p>
It would need transport provisions for reactants and products- the<br>
<p>
distributor might resemble a circulatory system, and might have some<br>
<p>
self-repairing capabilies.<br>
<p>
Maybe refresh rates could be governed by reaction-diffusion chemical <br>
<p>
clocks (a temperature-dependence problem here).<br>
<p>
Biolumenescent reactions would be neat for lighting or backlighting,<br>
<p>
they are quite efficient, I understand.<br>
