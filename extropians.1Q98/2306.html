<p>
That's right, the  Black Body radiation is continuos but the peak wavelength <br>
at temperature T is at  [.290cm K]/T .  <br>

               <br>
<p>
I don't see where you're going with this. If the target reflects a photon <br>
then it will receive a jolt equal to twice the photon's momentum of hc/w, <br>
h is Plank's constant c is the speed of light and w is the wavelength of the <br>
photon. If the photon is absorbed then it will only get half as much momentum <br>
but the energy absorbed will contribute to the rocket effect, exploding the<br>
outer layer of the target outward and compressing the inner layer. Either  <br>
way if you're close to a H bomb so many photons will be encountered that <br>
you'll feel a hell of a bang even in a vacuum.<br>
               <br>

Granted, but when you're talking about pressures comparable to those at the <br>
center of the sun it wouldn't take long to shatter a target.<br>

              <br>
Ok, if it's a few kilometers away then there are things you could do to  <br>
protect yourself from a small H bomb, but even today ICBM's can achieve  <br>
better accuracy that that.<br>

<p>
True, that's mainly because of the tritium, H bombs don't need a lot of it <br>
but they do need some and it's very expensive and has a half life of only <br>
10 years.<br>

<p>
It was Howard Morland and the trial was in 1979. Morland's lawyers were not <br>
scientists but they were given security clearances so they could read secret <br>
documents. To keep their client out of jail they said Morland did not reveal <br>
anything of importance, and then they said the following:<br>
<p>
" Essentially, the X rays produce a plasma of energized matter which pushes   <br>
  on the fusion fuel tamper in much the same way that boiling water produces  <br>
  steam which pushes the blades of a turbine. But Morland's discussion of   <br>
  role of radiation coupling in the compression of fusion fuel is as <br>
  inaccurate as if he said that boiling water turns the blades of a turbine, <br>
  he leaves out the steam. [...] Morland's discussion of the role of <br>
  radiation pressure is entirely incorrect."<br>
<p>
This was a very clever move, the Judge did not have access to secret documents  <br>
so he had no way to know the accuracy of this statement, and for obvious and  <br>
predictable reasons the prosecution refused to either confirm or deny it.  <br>
Reasonable doubt having been established Morland walked.<br>
<p>
The exploding Styrofoam theory never smelled quite right to me, in addition  <br>
to the Rayleigh - Taylor instability problem at such huge pressures there was <br>
another problem. The foam absorbs X rays and vaporizes explosively, but that  <br>
means the foam further from the fission trigger must receive weaker X rays <br>
and explode with less power, this would compress the fusion cylinder unevenly <br>
making a dud.<br>
<p>
It's clear that foam is important in an H bomb but probably not for the reason <br>
Morland's lawyers said. I don't know it for a fact but here is my theory. <br>
<p>
As I said in my other post the compression of the U238 around the fusion  <br>
cylinder by the soft X ray photons would be even greater than that produced <br>
by the huge radiation pressure because the soft X rays would vaporize the  <br>
outer layer of the cylinder which  would rocket outward, and because momentum <br>
is always conserved the inner  parts of the cylinder must rocket inward. <br>
The fact that Uranium atoms are very  massive would add to this rocket effect <br>
on the cylinder. Neutrons made by the fission trigger probably also <br>
contribute to the pressure by bouncing off the  wall of the Black Body <br>
chamber which is made of lead, that heavy element  reflects X rays as well as <br>
anything (still only a few percent or less) and the remaining photons are <br>
absorbed by the lead and heated to very high temperature and then re-radiated.<br>
<p>
The inner wall of the Black Body chamber is lined with a plastic foam made of  <br>
light elements like Hydrogen and Carbon, because unlike the case of the  <br>
fusion cylinder the rocket effect is a bad thing here, using light elements <br>
will minimize this and keep the chamber from blowing apart a little longer. <br>
A heavy slow moving atom and a light fast moving atom may have the same <br>
energy, but the light atom will have less momentum and so produce a smaller <br>
rocket effect because energy is mv^2 while momentum is just mv.<br>
<p>
The secondary use of the foam is probably what Morland's lawyers picked up on. <br>
The light, fast moving debris from the foam will put a little more pressure <br>
on  the cylinder and do it when it can still do some good, heavy slow moving  <br>
Uranium would take too long, the reaction would be over by the time they got <br>
there. <br>
<p>
You can't eliminate the rocket effect entirely and you still have the huge <br>
radiation pressure to deal with, so you must make the Black Body chamber very <br>
massive with lead to keep it intact for as long as possible. In general, <br>
if you want a part not to be destroyed by a huge pressure spike and remain <br>
intact for at least a few nanoseconds then coat it with a thick foam made of<br>
light elements and make the part heavy.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There is a thick cap of U-238 between the fission device and the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;fusion fuel, precisely to *prevent* the radiation from hitting the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;fusion fuel directly before compression can occur.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Correct, that's one reason the compression is so uniform. The cap is so  <br>
massive it survives long enough to shade the fusion cylinder for a while, <br>
it makes a shadow, a vacuum in the high pressure photon gas. Nature abhors a  <br>
vacuum and demands it be filled. <br>
