That is the point. Since nobody we know is stuck there, and we didn't have anything to do<br>
with creating the situation, its none of my business at this point.<br>
<p>
If the people there want my help, they should a) ask for it, b) have something to offer in<br>
return for my help, c) take my advice on fixing their own problems, and d) not object when<br>
I take action on their behalf to fix the situation. They are in the situation they are in<br>
because they cannot see the situation as I might see it. My actions are based on my own<br>
perceptions and experience and knowledge, which is obviously more effective considering<br>
that my country isn't anywhere near as screwed up as theirs.<br>
<p>
Instead, these people refuse our help until things are royally screwed up, and then beg for<br>
our help. When we come in and perform political/economic triage to fix things, they start<br>
protesting, bombing, and demanding we leave. Seems too many people don't like the saying<br>
"Be careful what you ask for, you might get it".<br>
