So why do you think it was the preservatives?  The consumption of <br>
preservatives has soared in this century but the rate of colds and flu<br>
have remained constant.  The highest rates of flu in the world are<br>
from South China, where preservates are few.  Flus and colds have<br>
many causes, but preservatives aren't one of them.<br>
<p>
Epidemiologists have been trying to link health problems to <br>
preservative consumption for decades and all they've come up with <br>
is that eating preservatives appears to *reduce* the chance of stomach <br>
cancer.  This was thought probably a fluke for many years, but now<br>
that Heliobacter pylori has been linked to stomach cancer it's <br>
thought that preservatives work through the rather prosaic method<br>
of killing the main cause of cancer in your stomach.<br>
