It's a little problem I have been puzzling with.<br>
<p>
In the future when all we &gt;H are uploaded and racing along at our own<br>
speed, we will have a serious interface problem. Personally I am looking<br>
forward to "the far side party" and am eager to participate. The only<br>
problem is in the assumed exponential scale of development that all of<br>
my backups and clones will have, as they race through the galaxy.<br>
Exponential growths leads to exponential growth in difference. Thus my<br>
(or should I say "ours" about me and the clones?) backups will have very<br>
different speeds.<br>
<p>
How on earth are we gonna dance at the party? With so different<br>
perceptions of time, Pitch and tempo will seem different to me/us all.<br>
<p>
This leads to a more general problem. How are we going to share our<br>
memories at the far side? Speech is out of the question I think. Way to<br>
slow and imprecise. Being uploaded as I/we are and converted to pure<br>
information processing, there must be a better way.<br>
<p>
We need to store what we have in common at the time of cloning, only<br>
then can we compare our differences in some kind of meaningful way. I/We<br>
should then be able to share those differences and have a distributed<br>
collective memory with multiple backups, which can then race along to<br>
"the really far side party" on the other end of the universe. Wherever<br>
that may be :-)<br>
<p>
Perhaps we should develop a generic human definition, so that all<br>
interested transhumans, not only one self and clones, can share memories<br>
and experiences? Sort of an icky thought. But who knows how a transhuman<br>
will feel?<br>
<p>
The "Human Core Definition" will be the smallest possible subset of<br>
self. Probably the memories and feelings of each &gt;H at the time of<br>
uploading, stored in a well defined manner, and with some kind of<br>
transmission protocol built in.<br>
<p>
This would allow us to make a clone, slow down it's speed and experience<br>
the farside party in some kind of real-time with others. When the<br>
party's done, the clone can be merged with the other clones and be part<br>
of the collective memory.<br>
<p>
It would even make it feasible for some &gt;H clones to stay on earth and<br>
help out in something approaching human standard time. When they have<br>
done their "tour of duty" they could then share the collective memory<br>
and their own experiences could become part of the collective memory.<br>
<p>
Thus my idea is to have a Human Core Definition that is endlessly<br>
extensible with the memories and experiences of clones / Backups /<br>
Agents / self, or whatever we choose to call them. Then we wouldn't need<br>
to have every experience ourselves but could share others. Or wouldn't<br>
that be us self after sharing... Hmm?<br>
<p>
whew!!! sorry for the lengthy post. Had i had more time It could<br>
probably have been shorter. (Wasn't that Mark Twain who said that?)<br>
