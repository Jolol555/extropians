<i>&gt; Of course. But what if you really aren't yourself at that time, i.e. in some kind of</i><br>

<i>&gt; solution would be to make a deal with others while fully conscious that allows</i><br>
<i>&gt; them to act on behalf of your primary persona during a fit or longer period</i><br>
<i>&gt; of insanity. There are however some problems with this, like what are people</i><br>
<i>&gt; to do during your first fit (no instructions), or what about strangers who see</i><br>
<i>&gt; you running around a busy highway naked and screaming etc. Sometimes</i><br>
<i>&gt; coercion can be really for one's own good (but I agree, it should be kept to</i><br>
<i>&gt; an absolute minimum).</i><br>
<p>
That is still for me to decide, even if its in a lucid moment and if I actually am nuts.<br>
Deviating from this in any manner opens the door for big brother to decide when you are<br>
insane or not, depending on your present political correctness, or for others to decide<br>
you are nuts in order to get ahold of your assets (the recent 'Roby Ridge' incident is<br>
one example of this). Some things cannot be surrendered, or we are all indanger of being<br>
enslaved by the do gooders. Whether it is for my own good, (in your opinion), is<br>
irrelevant. You are not the one with authority to decide.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A drunk</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or addict cannot get sober solely through the actions of others, but only through</i><br>
<i>&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; personal will to do so,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe this is more or less true at the moment(?), but I suppose that future medics</i><br>
<i>&gt; will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be able to correct any mental problem, whithout requiring your co-operation.</i><br>
<p>
SOrry, I don't know about your country, but here, doctors have to get your permission,<br>
or if your unconcious, the permission of next of kin to operate. I don't see this<br>
changing that much. Moreover there is more to substance dependency than just<br>
physiological. Unless you approve of others having free reign to just rewrite other's<br>
personalities, the only way for a person to kick a psychological dependency is through<br>
personal will. This is recognised in most all drug treatment programs. The 30-45 days<br>
you are in a treatment center is mostly for giving you time to kick the physiological<br>
dependency, but it takes years of personal work to change your psychological dependency.<br>
During this time, one is not insane.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nor should a person who has decided to end their lives be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; forcibly saved and then brainwashed by the shrink establishment into thanking</i><br>
<i>&gt; people for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; doing so.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, if you assume that there are in fact multiple personalities, of which one (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; more)</i><br>
<i>&gt; want(s) to live while the other(s) want(s) to die, then at least a part of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; person will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be truly grateful for saving him from the alter ego(s) that hijacked his mind. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; only</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem could be: which one of the multiple personalities is the "real" one? Or:</i><br>
<i>&gt; who's</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights should be respected? Maybe forcibly curing the person isn't such a bad idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; after all, because this is in fact the only way to please *both* personalities: the</i><br>
<i>&gt; suicidal one gets removed (his deathwish is granted) while the other, non-suicidal</i><br>
<i>&gt; one stays alive.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Just as the freedom of speech means that one has the freedom to NOT speak, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; right to life guarrantees that the individual has the right to decide when NOT to</i><br>
<i>&gt; live,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; otherwise, it is no right at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree, but with the mentally ill things are somewhat more complicated (see above).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
SInce 'mentally ill' is only defined by psychologists as a state where one's perception<br>
of reality differs from the mainstream, I think that this is not a criteria worth<br>
considering. By this definition, everyone on this list is quite insane. Do you want<br>
others making your health decisions for you?<br>
