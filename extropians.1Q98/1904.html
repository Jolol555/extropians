Well.....this is of course too tempting, not to respond on :-)<br>
<p>
For sure: We could pull it of !!!   if   sigh :-)<br>
<p>
- we can find the island/boat<br>
- enough people with money (anybody an educated guess?)<br>
- can found a start-up company(s) that generate income right away<br>
   * software development<br>
   * Internet selling/development<br>
   * Hotels (in case of a tropical island)<br>
   * selling art/books/music<br>
   * research<br>
   * etc..<br>
- we have a modest life-style (in the beginning)<br>
- we have practical laws<br>
- can export goods/knowledge<br>
-etc....<br>
<p>
I picture a: Tropical island with a (near by) airport, since a lot of "us"<br>
are<br>
doing business all over the world. Hotels, research labs (I think the bio-<br>
genetic industry, would be very interested), hospital, cryonics provider,<br>
"learning-farms" (were people can combine their holiday with catching up<br>
on the new stuff), self-supporting ecco systems, webbased polling systems<br>
on deciding what/how/were. Open libraries, conference centers were<br>
scientists from around the world can discuss everything, etc......<br>
(well "all" share some idea's :-)<br>
<p>
Well needless to say I would go all the way for this, if we could trigger a<br>
<p>
critical mass of people from this list to really develop a<br>
blue-print.........<br>
<p>
Anyone :-)<br>
<p>
Have a great day!<br>
