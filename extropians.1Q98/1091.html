<i>&gt; </i><br>
There is a fundamental difference. Trans-racoons are not the<br>
progenitors of humans.<br>
<p>
There are two possible relationships between humanity and<br>
post-human computer-based superintelligences (SI). Humans will either<br>
be "merely" the progenitors, or human-derived conscionesses will be<br>
incorporated into the SI. Even if we are "only" the initial<br>
creators of th SI, this still places us in the same relationship<br>
to the SI as we are to our human children. Unless you believe in<br>
an afterlife, our children and the artifacts and ideas we leave behind<br>
is all there is. With SI, your progeny are likely to remember<br>
you longer than your merely human decendents would, so you are<br>
more "relevant" to the SI than to simple humanity.<br>
<p>
More interesting is the possibility that your consciousness will<br>
be incorporated into the SI, or will evolve into the SI, or will<br>
upload into the SI, anywhere along the contuum from separate<br>
unmodified entity to complete assimilation. In any such<br>
scenario, you are as relevant to the SI as your current<br>
self is to you self of next week.<br>
