The British tended to respect cutural diversity, except in matters such as cannibalism<br>
and wife burning, etc., at least in their later colonial period. Of course the early<br>
period gave us countries like the US, Canada, and Australia, to name a few, with their<br>
attendant decimation of local native populations. Unlike the Spanish or French, who<br>
tended to wipe out cultures and enslave them throughout their colonial history, the<br>
British merely overlaid systems of parliamentary government, judicial systems, and<br>
undertook to educate the best and brightest of the natives. If you looked at a list of<br>
countries today that were once British colonies, and compared them to the former colonies<br>
of other former great powers, you would find that the former British colonies are today<br>
much more stable, and developed economically, politically, and culturally, by and large.<br>
<p>
Of course considering that three of the most well developed countries in the world were<br>
former early British Colonies where the natives were widely massacred, one might lend<br>
credence to old Longshanks' saying," The problem with Scotland is its full of Scots."<br>
<p>
Because the atrocities that were commited by many powers during the imperial era so<br>
besmirched the colonial concept, it is politically impossible to engage in such a<br>
practice today, no matter how badly needed it is, and how well publicly overseen it might<br>
be. Of course, the PC term today would be 'nation building' but everyone knows what it<br>
means.<br>
