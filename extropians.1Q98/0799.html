I just read a message entitled "Immortal Astronaut"<br>
on the Future Culture mailing list, about 77-year-old<br>
John Glenn going to space again, and thought:<br>
what if NASA decides to launch a manned star<br>
mission at some point?   They would have to take<br>
serious measures to extend the lives of the crew<br>
then, and would explain to the public that radical<br>
life extension is sometimes a good thing...<br>
<p>
  There will probably be other uses of technologies<br>
of extropian interest that would justify them in the<br>
public opinion: improving the intelligence of military<br>
commanders in the time of war so that they could better<br>
protect the average citizens, enhancing physical skills<br>
of surgeons and empathic abilities of social workers who<br>
help "disadvantaged individuals", improve sensitivity of<br>
doctors working with cute babies, extending lives of<br>
public heroes, etc.  And then, among the thousands of<br>
"good" uses, the technology wouldn't seem that evil anymore...<br>
Look how little time was needed to make opponents of<br>
"commercialization of the Net"  cool their rage...<br>
They were so prominent just a couple of years ago -<br>
and now nobody even discusses the topic.  The "Net<br>
socialists" were not destroyed or out-argued; they<br>
were just drowned by the practical logic of the Net<br>
development.<br>
  So if we just come up with some "PC uses" for cloning<br>
and telomerase manipulation...<br>
