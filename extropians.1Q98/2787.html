WHAT IS A "CRACKPOT" ?<br>
<p>
The term "crackpot" is often deployed within<br>
"scientific" oriented circles upon various <br>
individuals who have become targets of scorn.<br>
As such, the term "crackpot" falls into the <br>
category of "personal insult" or "ad hominem."<br>
<p>
Let's try to introduce some logic into this <br>
inflammatory deployment of terminology by ask-<br>
ing the simple question: "What is a crackpot"?<br>
<p>
Random House Webster's College Dictionary defines<br>
"crackpot" (and the following subterms) as such:<br>
<p>
<p>
  CRACKPOT: n. 1. a person who is eccentric, <br>
  fanatical, or irrational. --adj. 2. eccen-<br>
  tric; fanatical; irrational.<br>
<p>
   Fanatic: n. 1. a person with an extreme<br>
   and uncritical enthusiasm or zeal...<br>
<p>
   Eccentric: adj. 1. deviating from the acc-<br>
   epted or customary character, practice, <br>
   ect.; unconventional; peculiar; odd.<br>
<p>
   Irrational: adj. 1. lacking the facility <br>
   of reason; deprived of reason.<br>
<p>
<p>
Now let's try to extract exactly the definition<br>
of "crackpot" as it is deployed in "scientific"<br>
circles. Albert Einstein was "eccentric," how-<br>
ever the term "crackpot," as it occurs in scien-<br>
tific circles, would not properly be applied to<br>
Einstein. Einstein was also fanatical in his devo-<br>
tion to the formation of his theories, but since<br>
"fanatic" implies "uncritical," this defines a <br>
disjunction between the "fanatical" subterm of <br>
"crackpot" and Albert Einstein. So this leaves<br>
us with the subterm "irrational" to define the<br>
deployment of the term "crackpot" to various<br>
targets in and/or by the scientific community.<br>
<p>
The subterm "irrational" defines exactly the <br>
proper application of the term "crackpot" in<br>
scientific circles (which is not to say that <br>
improper applications of the term may not be <br>
deployed), since "irrational" implies being <br>
"deprived of reason," and reason, defined as<br>
"logical thinking," is a cornerstone of any<br>
properly defined "scientific community."<br>
<p>
<p>
CONCLUSION<br>
<p>
When a member of a "scientific circle" (how-<br>
ever loosely defined) calls person X "a crack-<br>
pot," the term properly proclaims that person<br>
X is "irrational" that they "lack the faculty <br>
of proper reason," and ultimately that their <br>
ideas are "false."<br>
<p>
It follows therefore that a false theory could<br>
be properly defined as a "crackpot theory."<br>
But most properly, a "crackpot theory" should<br>
be defined as a false theory that is promoted<br>
even in light of the fact that it can be shown<br>
to be false by an objective set of self-con-<br>
sistent, or logical, standards.<br>
<p>
<p>
CROCKPOT IDENTITY THEORY<br>
<p>
Since the popular definition of identity is<br>
atomist and states "A=A," which is to say <br>
that the identity of A is exclusive to A, <br>
that A is what it is due exclusively to A,<br>
and since nobody has ever been able to show<br>
a single example where this claim is true<br>
-- showing A being A free from any associa-<br>
tion to not-A -- it cannot be said to be a<br>
true identity theory, and logic therefore <br>
dictates that it must be a false theory,<br>
particularly when the identity theory, <br>
"A=A+~A," is never shown to be false.<br>
<p>
Even as the set of evidence supporting A=A <br>
is an empty set, people go on promoting it <br>
without so much as a second thought; in fact,<br>
many of its supporters fanatically attack <br>
anyone who dares to questions it. It there-<br>
fore follows that "atomist-identity theory" <br>
is properly defined as a "crackpot theory."<br>
