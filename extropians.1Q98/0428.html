Many extropians and other generally rational people label themselves<br>
"atheist", meaning that they don't believe in God.  Some go even further<br>
and believe that there is no God.  Many atheists seem to be against the<br>
concept of God in any form.  I've noticed many times on this list that<br>
when the subject of God comes up, many atheists, in typical knee-jerk<br>
fashion, renounce the whole idea, even though the God concept is<br>
significantly different than standard God concepts.  I doubt this<br>
rejection of all possible God concepts is rational.<br>
<p>
My belief is that unless a theory is logically inconsistent or disagrees<br>
with experiential evidence, then it cannot be rejected entirely.  Of<br>
course, theories with much supporting evidence should be considered more<br>
applicable to reality than those with little or none.  But there is no<br>
rational basis for *rejecting* a theory without sufficient evidence<br>
against it.<br>
<p>
There is a huge variety of God concepts.  Probably the most familiar to<br>
those on this list are the Judeao-Christian God concepts.  Many people,<br>
including atheists, have a hard time thinking about God without using<br>
these limited concepts.  But there are countless other ways to invent God<br>
concepts.<br>
<p>
The idea that our universe was created by an intelligent being is very<br>
attractive to most people.  Of course, that intelligent being could have<br>
many possible characteristics and motivations.  Many atheists continue to<br>
use the tired argument, "if there is a God, why all the suffering?",<br>
without realizing that there is no connection between creating a universe<br>
and ensuring that no suffering occurs within that system.  They have<br>
placed the unnecessary restriction that God must care about suffering and<br>
is able to do anything about it.  That's also true for their arguments<br>
regarding omnipotence or omniscience.  *Some* people's Gods have those<br>
qualities, but not every God concept includes God being omnipotent and<br>
omniscient.  <br>
<p>
When atheists state there is no God, they are making a very bold,<br>
unsupported claim, since there are so many possible variations on the God<br>
concept.  I don't consider it rational to make such claims without any<br>
supporting evidence or logical proofs.<br>
<p>
Now, I'm not saying there is a God; I have no idea.  But possibilities<br>
are possibilities until proven otherwise.  I prefer not to close my mind<br>
prematurely on any subject.  That way, I don't limit myself with my own<br>
mental fixations.<br>
