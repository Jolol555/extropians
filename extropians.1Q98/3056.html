<p>
Actually, I wasn't saying this, as I know you understood.  To reiterate, I<br>
find a real rational value in extending a culture of benevolence and, in most<br>
cases (see below), that the most rational and moral way to do this is to look<br>
for the most efficient means of achieving the end of extending benevolence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I always was thought that judgements as to what is 'better' were way beyond</i><br>

<p>
Actually, it's impossible to segregate the two inquiries and attempts to do so<br>
in the past have failed miserably by paying too little heed to moral questions<br>
on the one hand or economic realities on the other.<br>

<i>&gt;   &gt;A first-world kid who</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;has never wielded a hammer, floundering around trying to </i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;build a school in Zambia, may well be a waste.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Or it may be a very educational experience of a type 1st-world universities</i><br>
<i>&gt;  don't offer. Down in the mud you learn a lot about organizing projects and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  effecient usage of (very limited) resources. But most of all you can learn</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to keep yourself and others going under difficult circumstances.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Most '1st-world kids' don't do the actual hammer wielding of course but</i><br>
<i>&gt;  contribute their western knowledge or academic skills (that is, if they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;  serious about their aid). The people living in third-world countries are</i><br>
<i>&gt;  perfectly capable of digging a canal, designing a integrated irrigation</i><br>
<i>&gt;  system however may be beyond their capabilities (not suprising since many</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of them never had the opportunity to master reading and writing).</i><br>
<p>
Of course, the problem here is political.  Most third world countries are<br>
dominated by corrupt, centralized tyrannies.  A bunch of idealistic first-<br>
world liberal democrats really managing development projects is the last thing<br>
such tyrants want.  On the other hand, they probably instinctively sense the<br>
ultimate futility and ineffectiveness of isolated donations of manual labor,<br>
and therefore are more willing to allow the occasional case of sunburn in such<br>
instances.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;A skilled carpenter's donation of a season of</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;such work, though, may well be perfectly rational, as would </i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;supporting that effort with a donation of capital by the first-world kid,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;whose talents are more effectively employed as a computer programmer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I won't argue that the kid will become a better programmer through these</i><br>
<i>&gt;  kind of experiences but there's more to life than pumping C++ code. A</i><br>
<i>&gt;  change in environment, broadening her/his horizon might make for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  stronger, self-sufficient and more balanced person. The effectiveness of an</i><br>
<i>&gt;  employee in the function of programmer is only partly due to his/her</i><br>
<i>&gt;  programming abilities, being able to teamwork and function under stress are</i><br>
<i>&gt;  just as important.</i><br>
<p>
Here I think you have a very valuable point.  First-worlders who gain no<br>
experience of manual labor or poverty miss a lot: Direct personal experience<br>
of such things gives one a lot of perspective (and a few handy skills) in<br>
later life.  I may be prejudiced, since I spent a few years in this way when I<br>
was younger and feel richer for it now.  Thus, I'm not contending that<br>
spending some time pounding nails in Ecuador is a completely wasteful thing, I<br>
just don't believe that in most instances such efforts have much real effect<br>
on the worthwhile targets of philanthropy and benevolence involved.<br>
