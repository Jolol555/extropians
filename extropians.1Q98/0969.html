In the early 80's, before he had heard of memes but while computer<br>
viruses were getting their first media exposure, my friend Steve<br>
Robsky at Data General (aka Dirty Genitals Corporation) came up<br>
with the following:<br>
<p>
Steve: "Suppose there were ideas that were like viruses, so that once<br>
you hear them, they take over your mental processes and you can't<br>
stop thinking of them?"<br>
Me: "I think there are plenty of ideas like that."<br>
Steve (conspiratorial whisper): "Right! And further suppose that the <br>
idea of a mental virus was one such ..."<br>
<p>
----------------------------------------<br>
<p>
It's possible to view the output of any identifiable group of<br>
organisms, including humanity-as-a-whole, as a computation which is an<br>
emergent property of the group's functioning (cf. Tipler [there's more<br>
to Tipler's hypothesis, of course] and Douglas Adams, not to mention a<br>
lot of half-remembered early posts to this list). These computations<br>
vary in their degree of directedness and efficiency. Seems to me the<br>
efficiency of all but a few of them is ~0, especially since the<br>
"results" aren't recorded anywhere or recognized as such. Surely part<br>
of the appeal of cyberspace (and eventually upload space) is the<br>
potential for raising that ~0 to a usable fraction.<br>
<p>
So far, =0 of this is new. OK, suppose there are a number of diffuse <br>
computations that are timesharing our nervous systems, mostly at levels<br>
we're not conscious of (because if we were conscious of them, as good<br>
capitalists, we'd be looking for a billing address, neh?). Maybe a<br>
lot of our undirected, inexplicable behaviors are I/O operations in<br>
those computations. It is then also possible that as we expand our<br>
awareness and control of mental functioning, a side effect is that we<br>
disrupt a number of these parasites. Maybe those of us who eventually<br>
upload shed all of the old organic ones ...<br>
<p>
... and find a new set of much more efficient parasite programs running <br>
around "up" there ... &lt;evil grin&gt;. This says I should definitely keep <br>
working on data security, I'll always have work! Just imagine the <br>
disaster recovery plan for a Jupiter brain ...<br>
