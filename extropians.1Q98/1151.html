One of the limiting factors in human population is food production.  One<br>
of the main reasons so many humans are alive today is because of the<br>
tremendous success of agricultural science.  Much of that success has to<br>
do with learning to grow more food in less space.  Much work has been<br>
done and is still being done with growing food hydroponically (spraying<br>
the fully exposed roots of growing plants with nutrient solutions), with<br>
excellent results.  If the work continues as expected, the costs of<br>
growing food hydroponically will continue to decrease, and agriculture<br>
will no longer be confined to the soil.  This would also mean that there<br>
would eventually be no reason to locate major agricultural production<br>
facilities hundreds of miles away from highly populated cities.  When we<br>
have the technology to do so, it will make more sense to carry out<br>
agriculture right in the city, in tall buildings; layers and layers of<br>
dense agricultural production.  Stacking the layers up, instead of only<br>
using one layer as we do now, will mean we can produce more food using<br>
less land space.  Also, the fact that plants can be grown several times<br>
more densely when grown hydroponically will save even more on the land<br>
space.<br>
<p>
Besides being able to get fresh fruit and vegetables at low prices all<br>
year round, this sort of agriculture would mean that the amount of<br>
cultivatible land would no longer be the limit to human population that<br>
it is now.  Agricultural production could occur almost everywhere.  All<br>
we need is the facilities, water and a large supply of energy for the<br>
lights and environmental controls.  <br>
<p>
The human population could become quite large, indeed.  But how desirable<br>
is a huge human population, one several times larger than the current<br>
population?  Considering that nothing like it has ever happened before,<br>
it's very hard to predict what so many billions of people will do.  It<br>
will mean far more brilliant and hard-working geniuses than ever before. <br>
And it may also mean far more psychopaths and criminals, but it also<br>
means more people to stop them.  <br>
<p>
Of course, humans can't maintain our current exponential growth rate<br>
forever (we would quickly use all of the matter in the solar system, just<br>
for human bodies, but we have enough resources here on earth and in the<br>
surrounding space (asteroids and near-by planets) to increase our<br>
population to quite a large number.  Any speculations on the results of a<br>
population several times larger than the current one?<br>
