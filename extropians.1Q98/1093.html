About the misognist accusation...It is my opinion that because Clinton<br>
has had the majority of the womens' vote...this fiasco is the "other<br>
side's" attempt to discredit him and his party with this block of<br>
voters. (Anything to win an election!)  Personally, I am sick and tired<br>
of it all.  Let the Pres do his job.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On what planet?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Did anyone else ever see an obscure movie called "Eating the Rich"?  Among a</i><br>
<i>&gt; variety of strange plotlines, there is the story of a high-ranking Government</i><br>
<i>&gt; Official who gets trapped in a sex scandal based on having had an extramarital</i><br>
<i>&gt; affair.  The person who sets him up hopes, of course, that this will ruin the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Official and force him from office.  Except in that story, the trap backfires.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Official's popularity soars like never before, as the Tabloids run story</i><br>
<i>&gt; after story about how the Official "gets his little bit on the side."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've always loved that line, and wish it were more like that in this country.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Does anyone, in this day and age, actually believe that a guy like Clinton is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a wife-loving family man?  That he could possibly resist the allure of</i><br>
<i>&gt; sex brought by the mystique of being powerful?  Of course not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But once it's out in the open, well, then we'd better hang him, eh?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;/RANT&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry for taking up bandwidth with nothing more than a complaint.</i><br>
