I don't know if it has anything to do with aging but in today's (Jan 16) issue <br>
of Science, the same one that has the stuff about telomerase and immortal <br>
human cells, there is another interesting article. Scott Campbell and Patricia  <br>
Murphy found another biological clock, it works at a much higher level than<br>
the cell and is a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. <br>
This clock is responsible for our sleep patterns among other things, when it <br>
gets out of whack we get jet lag and winter depression. Campbell and Murphy <br>
found a way to reset this clock with light, but the astonishing thing is that <br>
the light need not be applied to the eyes, anywhere on the skin will do, <br>
the back of the knee for example. There must be a signal but how the brain <br>
knows that light is being applied to the back of the knee is a mystery. <br>
The authors say the procedure is harmless and easy to do  and should soon be <br>
in common use on airliners. Any potential for more profound applications <br>
remains to be seen.<br>
