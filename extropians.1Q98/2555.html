<i>&gt; storage area to store hydrogen and oxygen, burning them</i><br>

<i>&gt; suitable location.  This would cut down the storage</i><br>
<i>&gt; capacity of the tankers, but maybe not too much, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; would relieve the need to haul extremely heavy</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuclear material (and compact shielding; does the</i><br>
<i>&gt; moon have easily mined lead?) up from Earth.</i><br>
<p>
Remember, you are at the poles. Therefore, your solar collectors will have to<br>
receive sunlight that is running parallel to the ground, which means that you<br>
can only have ONE row of panels at the pole, and the whole row must spin<br>
about the pole in formation so as not to block each other.<br>
<p>
Once again, we see the idea of hydrogen as an energy source rear its ignorant<br>
head, this time on the moon. There is nothing hydrogen transport can do that<br>
can't be done better by a high voltage line, or by maser transmission from<br>
solar sats.<br>
<p>
Considering that we are talking about just afew mountaintops at the poles<br>
that would be in sunlight, any real estate available would be too valuable to<br>
waste with such area intensive power sources as solar. One garbage can sized<br>
reactor can do the job of a couple of sqare mile sized solar panel farm.<br>
Better yet, considering the fecundity of Helium III in lunar regolith, build<br>
fusion plants there.<br>
<p>
'Oh, but we must protect the lunar ecology!!'<br>
<p>
The moon is an ideal place for widespread use of nuclear power. One might say<br>
that it is its natural use.<br>
<p>
Those that declaim the 'environmental impact' of nuclear power use always<br>
seem to ignore the toxic waste issue with the manufacture of solar panels.<br>
