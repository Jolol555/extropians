<i>&gt; This reminds me of another repressive regime where I had to risk my</i><br>
<i>&gt; health and career to obtain books from black marketeers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Talk about indifference of transhumanism to politics...)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Could anybody recommend a serious private discussion groups that deals</i><br>
<i>&gt; with these topics - or be interested in forming one?</i><br>
<p>
The dangers of such a discussion group are obvious, but one of<br>
the things in Rivest's paper on "Chaffing" stuck with me: the fact<br>
that a third party with no knowledge of keys can do the work<br>
made me wonder if that couldn't be used to do a pseudonymous<br>
remailer like Julf's without the risk of cops subpoenaing your<br>
database--because you have none.<br>
<p>
Here's an idea I think would work; would the more cipherpunk<br>
connected among you please evaluate this idea for me?<br>
<p>
Let's say we form discussion group of 50 people.  Each of us<br>
uses a standard piece of software to receive mail from the<br>
group and to post mail to it (a Usenet newsreader modified<br>
as described later).  The list of addresses for the group is <br>
known publicly (members can use other mail forwarders for<br>
added security if desired).  Each time a message is posted<br>
to the group or mailed to another user with this software,<br>
the real return address is stripped, and a new set of headers<br>
is added with, say, 20 return addresses, each accompanied<br>
by a MAC; the "real" one has a MAC using the sender's private<br>
key, and the rest a random one.  The MACs are all calculated<br>
using message ID/time so that they don't repeat.  The 19<br>
addresses are chosen at random from the group (for even more<br>
security, members can each have more than one address).<br>
<p>
When anyone wants to respond privately to a message, he<br>
composes the message and addresses it to all 20 of the names<br>
listed, using their MACs; 20 people receive it, but only the<br>
real author can authenticate eir address; the software<br>
quietly discards the message to the other 19.  There is no<br>
central list of keys at the forwarding server; only the<br>
addresses and MACs in each message.  There is no way to<br>
tell from the message which of the 20 senders is real, even<br>
for the list manager, yet personal replies are still<br>
possible.<br>
<p>
Is this practical/useful?  Could it be combined with real<br>
encryption as well without revealing identities (I haven't<br>
thought that far through)?<br>
<p>
I suggest using a Usenet system because every message, even<br>
the personal ones, get sent to many people--in fact the more<br>
people, the more secure.  The softare on each member's desk<br>
could rotate MAC keys weekly or so, and keep only as much<br>
history as ey felt was safe.  That way, even if one message<br>
was compromised, they system as a whole is still safe.<br>
