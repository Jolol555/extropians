<i>&gt;&gt; Abrams and Wrigley: Towns in Societies (1978), page 41 by Keith</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Hopkins: "The minimum tonnage which would give a shipowner tax</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; immunity for bringing wheat to the city of Rome was 325 tonnes</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; burden, but that could be split among several ships, provided</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; none was less then 65 tonnes burden (Digest. 50, 5, 3)"</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; [burden = cargo, Seems ships of less than 65 to were unwanted</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; because they consumed too much manpower and caused too much traffic.]</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The rule as cited says nothing about the size of individual ships; it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;just a tax break for big business.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, big business does not necessarily mean big ships. But there's more:<br>
<p>
Greek and Roman Technology (1997):<br>
<p>
1 medimnos (Greek) = 46 l<br>
1 modius (Roman) = 8.7 l<br>
<p>
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities 3.44.2-3:<br>
<p>
"...merchant ships of a capacity up to 3000 enter at the mouth<br>
of the river and arrive at Rome under oar or tow."<br>
[larger unload in habour to river barges]<br>
<p>
3000 modius = 26 tonnes -&gt; 3000 medimnos = 138 tonnes. He was obviously<br>
talking about medimnos, because he a) was a Greek and b) the other number<br>
would not have made any sense.<br>
<p>
There's more to come. I have another source that states that there were<br>
about 60 to 80 ships of the Isis type (1200 tonnage, 2900 brutto register<br>
tons). Have we now made it clear enough that the Roman ships were far<br>
superior to MA and Viking ones?<br>
<p>
