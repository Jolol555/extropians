On the contrary, most forms of personal defense can readily handle most any<br>
personal threat, even so far as  poison gas. However, it takes people willing<br>
to purchase and use such tools before thay are of any use. People care more<br>
about the 'appearance' of a threat as a deterrent to a would be attacker. Most<br>
people do not want to have to actually use the guns they carry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Which will be widely available first, personal nukes, or personal nuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt; defense?</i><br>
<p>
I think that the day some terrorist group demonstrates their ability to deploy<br>
a nuke in an urban area is the day that SDI technologies will quickly come to<br>
the market, if only at first for cities to purchase for their police forces.<br>
The difficulty with defensive technologies is the energy requirements versus<br>
reusability. While some kinetic kill missiles would be cheap, they are only<br>
one shot apeice, while a railgun or laser system requires a huge energy<br>
production and storeage capacity. Eventually, though, as the need for high<br>
energy weapons are needed for space travel, they will be come more<br>
commonplace. Also, space based weapons can be lower powered than ground based<br>
installations, as they don't have so mcuh atmosphere to punch through.<br>
