<i>&gt; &gt;SInce 'mentally ill' is only defined by psychologists as a state where</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;one's perception of reality differs from the mainstream, I think that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;this is not a criteria worth considering. By this definition, everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;on this list is quite insane.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think you are misrepresenting psychology here. Mainstream psychology</i><br>
<i>&gt; has no accepted definition of the "mainstream" or "normality" people</i><br>
<i>&gt; are supposed to conform to (many of the suggested definitions are very</i><br>
<i>&gt; wide, and it should be remembered that Freud even denied the existence</i><br>
<i>&gt; of normality), and most definitions of mental disorders have little to</i><br>
<i>&gt; do with comparisions to a normal state and are instead defined from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; classification of their symptoms (as revealed unto mankind in the holy</i><br>
<i>&gt; DSM-IV :-).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The important question is of course when a state should be regarded as</i><br>
<i>&gt; a mental disorder or not. Modern psychology is aware of cultural</i><br>
<i>&gt; differences here (just look into any modern clinical psychiatry book),</i><br>
<i>&gt; but there are many states that are obviously undesirable even from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; perspective of the patient. A more general definition would be to say</i><br>
<i>&gt; that something is a mental disorder if it impairs a person's ability</i><br>
<i>&gt; to live a normal life - this is where the "normal" appears - but in</i><br>
<i>&gt; most cases this is a very basic "normal" like "able to interact with</i><br>
<i>&gt; other people, able to distinguish reality from imagination, will not</i><br>
<i>&gt; hurt himself". It can be abused, but usually it is fairly clear if</i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody can function or not. Where to draw the lines is widely</i><br>
<i>&gt; debated in psychiatry and psychology today, it is not a tacit</i><br>
<i>&gt; agreement.</i><br>
<p>
ok I'll bite:<br>
<p>
Extropians List subscribers could be construed by mainstreamers to:<br>
a) have social dysfunctions indicated by the fact they spend so much time<br>
discussing strange topics on an internet mail list, therefore have<br>
difficulty interacting with people in the 'real' world.<br>
b) have a difficulty distinguishing their internet life from their real<br>
lives (if they have real lives), and in fantasizing about htings like mind<br>
uploading and a mythical transhuman singularity, nanotechnology and jupiter<br>
brains, have difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality.<br>
c) in their wishes to upload their minds (which seems like it would be a<br>
destructive process), support the right to suicide, promote the use of guns<br>
for self defense, and have themselves frozen, they demonstrate a lack of<br>
concern for their own safety and well being, and are likely to hurt<br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
So an active and dedicated extropian could be construed to be quite ill.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As for this list, I haven't noticed much insanity here. Most</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropians seem to be able to do reality-testing, so they are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; delusional. The paranoia level seems fairly normal for the internet in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the 90's. No obvious mood disorders as far as I can see, quite the</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposite.</i><br>
<p>
Thats my point. The members of this list are entirely TOO rational and<br>
logical, as compared to the general population. That we can rationally<br>
discuss such theoretical subjects as a transhuman singularity without (too<br>
frequently) going off on almost theological trysts indicates that the<br>
members of this list are not normal.<br>
