<i>&gt; Actually, I'd just like to add that in the last few months I've come to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusion that the majority of commercial Web sites are cack produced by</i><br>
<i>&gt; people who care more about flash graphics than assisting their customers, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; who don't even realise how much money they're losing in the process.</i><br>
<p>
Such is the process of natural selection on the web. Sites that don't get traffic,<br>
don't succeed. Unfortunately, most marketing people who fund website development<br>
have blinders on, seeing websites as just another type of print advertising, or<br>
even worse, tv advertising. They throughly fail to see it as an integrated part of<br>
their technical and customer support system, their sales demonstration and<br>
sales/distribution system. Those companies which do recognise this make money.<br>
THose that  don't, die.<br>
<p>
Rather than gagging, look at it as a chance to study a new ecology, see what life<br>
forms work, what forms don't work, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, I just followed a link to a web-site for a film magazine; only</i><br>
<i>&gt; to reach a page saying 'Sorry, but your browser doesn't meet our requirements,</i><br>
<i>&gt; click here to download Internet Explorer'.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, tying your site to a closed standard is the curse of death. Unfortunately,<br>
too many web authors prefer to go for th glitz to make quick sales (especially if<br>
they aren't paid by the amount of traffic the site generates), and web tools are<br>
not presently under  a standard. Entirely too many people have learned the<br>
VHS/Betamax lesson by this point, at least on the software side. Now nobody can<br>
agree on a standard. Makes a libertarian long for a monopoly, almost.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now I don't want Internet Explorer, I don't care what *their* requirements</i><br>
<i>&gt; are. They are the ones who are supposed to be selling *me* something, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; they block me out of their site so that they can include some dumb Java</i><br>
<i>&gt; animated graphics. Do they have a clue?</i><br>
<p>
Which is why I use Netscape, I use animated GIFs, and complex form structures, and<br>
CGI, as well as only java that is usable on all major browsers (ALHPABrowser, btw,<br>
in the words of its lead programmer to me: "gracefully ignores java", which is<br>
fine for a dumb terminal network environment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another example: a couple of days ago I was searching the Web for a place</i><br>
<i>&gt; to buy a copy of Adobe Premiere; according to the Adobe site, a $750 product.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I went to a site that I've bought from before, to check out their prices. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; clicked on the button, but it didn't work because they've replaced their old</i><br>
<i>&gt; CGI scripts with Javascript, and I have all that cack disabled because of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the security holes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; They lost a $750 order by trying to force their customers to do what the</i><br>
<i>&gt; company want them to do, rather than catering to all of us.</i><br>
<p>
sucks to be them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another example: the numerous web sites where people have decided that</i><br>
<i>&gt; HTML text is too low-tech and use images for all their buttons (or worse,</i><br>
<i>&gt; all their content!) with no ALT tags. I don't even have image download</i><br>
<i>&gt; enabled because it's too damn slow on many sites... again, I go elsewhere</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a site that's not so pretty but chooses to help me.</i><br>
<p>
Even on my personal site, which, I admit, I don't use many alt tags on images, I<br>
always offer a text navigation bar at the bottom of the page.<br>
<p>
However, I will remind you that most business on the web is done in a graphical<br>
environment. Those of you who are still stuck in ascii-land are WAY behind the<br>
curve, sorry to say. Now, it has its place, but still, you shouldn't be driving<br>
your Yugo on the Autobahn at 45 mph and expect me to slow down my Passat, Volvo,<br>
SAAB, BMW, or even a Ferrari, down for you. ('Gene, what the hell are you driving<br>
over in Russia???)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; No wonder Internet commerce is not the cash cow people expected...</i><br>
<p>
Why, because all those cobol programmers reading their email in vi, browsing with<br>
lynx,  etc on their 3151 unix terminals, who make $100,000 plus a year and need to<br>
shop from the computer are too stubborn to get with the technological curve?<br>
Commerce on the net comes from selling unique products to many people. Ascii is a<br>
horrendous sales medium.<br>
