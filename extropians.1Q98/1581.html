John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt; responded:<br>

<i>&gt; True, and equally true is the fact that the data in a computer's</i><br>
<i>&gt; memory that a photo cell has received a photon of 700 nm light is</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing like that light.  I don't know if that data is anything like</i><br>
<i>&gt; my idea of red, and I don't know if your red is the same as mine</i><br>
<i>&gt; either.</i><br>
<p>
	Exactly!  I wish all people that thought about consciousness<br>
would get this simple representational idea through their skull!  Then<br>
we might be able to make some progress in this field.<br>
<p>
	In order to know that we use the same red, you must<br>
objectively know what and why red is or what objective physical<br>
phenomenon produces a red sensation in our consciousness and be able<br>
to objectively observe that particular phenomenon going on in your<br>
brain and my brain before we can know if we use the same subjective<br>
sensation to represent 700 nm light.  I like to call this "effing" of<br>
the ineffable which we will be able to do once we understand what and<br>
why qualia are and can objectively observe such phenomenon<br>
representing information in our consciousness awareness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All bits are abstract whether in a brain or a machine, and if</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers contained nothing but non unified set of bits they would</i><br>
<i>&gt; produce only gibberish. They don't.</i><br>
<p>
	You can measure possible diversity or information content in<br>
any particular physical data media as bits of information, and you can<br>
abstractly simulate any physical media or physical representation with<br>
any other physical process as long as it can store the same number of<br>
bits of information (but it is usually not possible to represent one<br>
physical phenomenon with equal efficiency in some other physical<br>
media.  For example: one oxygen atom can represent perfectly what one<br>
oxygen atom is like but it takes many atoms of silicone formed into<br>
transistors to achieve enough abstract bits to represent all the<br>
information about one single oxygen atom, not to mention the<br>
additional interpretation hardware...)<br>
<p>
	What the fundamental physical representation is like is very<br>
important to consciousness and our ability to process information and<br>
consciously "know" about things.  When there is a dot of red qualia in<br>
a field of green in our conscious representation of a strawberry<br>
patch, the fundamental nature of this red qualia, what it is like, how<br>
it is fundamentally different than a green qualia, how it stands out,<br>
and how it is represented in an isomorphically similar 3D space in our<br>
mind is a key part of the computation process that allows us to be<br>
aware of and select the ripe strawberry that is ready to be picked.<br>
What these qualia phenomenally are, how they are fundamentally<br>
different from one another, and how they are unified together into one<br>
simultaneous filed of visual conscious knowledge in our brain is why<br>
we are smartly aware.  Unlike an abstract machine which purposefully<br>
isolates it's representations from the particular physical<br>
representation of the data, requiring much more machinery to<br>
accomplish the same intelligent awareness, especially if it is a man<br>
in a room.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To exist information must be in a context, otherwise a hole in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; paper tape is not data it's just a hole, but there is nothing unique</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the human mind in that regard.</i><br>
<p>
	No.  This is only when talking about abstract information.<br>
The meaning of a whole in a paper tape, as you say, perfectly<br>
represents a whole in a paper tape.  THAT is the meaning unless you<br>
put it in or interpret it within some other context.  An oxygen atom<br>
perfectly represents what that oxygen atom is like.  Again, THAT is<br>
the meaning.  It is when you try to represent that oxygen atom with<br>
wholes in paper tape that requires the mapping, context, and<br>
interpretation.  Red is like red, there is no other meaning required.<br>
But, in the context of our consciousness and other color quali, it can<br>
represent 700 nm light and visa versa.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As for Searle's Chinese Room, it only proves one thing, a very small</i><br>
<i>&gt; part of a mechanism does not have all the attributes of the whole.</i><br>
<p>
	No!  All Searls's Chinese Room proves is that any physical<br>
phenomenon, no matter how absurdly inefficient, can abstractly<br>
represent or model any other physical phenomenon, including conscious<br>
qualia, and can eventually duplicate the output.  This has nothing to<br>
do with the fundamental nature of qualia and what consciously aware<br>
information is fundamentally composed of and what it is fundamentally<br>
like.<br>
