<i>&gt; &gt; Also i heard that they have very bright and inexpensive light bulbs (and grow</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; companies are supressing it, kinna like the way oil companies supress</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alternative energy devices.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You mean halogen lightbulbs? I don't know about the situation in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; US, but here in Sweden they are actively pushed by the electricity</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies (yes, our electricity companies try to make us consume less</i><br>
<i>&gt; electricity, and the liquor monopoly does it best to discourage</i><br>
<i>&gt; drinking. Sweden is fantastic :-).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As for hydroponics, yes, electric light would do with the right kind</i><br>
<i>&gt; of illumination. No need for skyscrapers: Genetic Engineering News had</i><br>
<i>&gt; an article in March 15 1995 about growing plants in an underground</i><br>
<i>&gt; mine, with very positive results.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With enough energy, most things are possible. Sunlight is nice because</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is so available in most places (i.e. everywhere but Sweden :-) - I</i><br>
<i>&gt; really like the idea of skyscrapers with glass walls facing the south,</i><br>
<i>&gt; filled with greenery. The hydroponics could be grown in trellises</i><br>
<i>&gt; between the outer wall and an inner, thinner glass wall with</i><br>
<i>&gt; apartments on the inside. That way you could get both sunlight,</i><br>
<i>&gt; greenery and climate control.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Most crops plants, when planted in a field, completely cover the field,<br>
capturng all the available solar energy that a plant can capture. To<br>
beat this in a multi-level skyscraper, you'll have to add energy. What<br>
source do you propose? Obviously not solar. Unless you indend to build<br>
solar cells that are more efficient than plants, you will be better off<br>
simply replacing your solar collectors with farms, either on earth or<br>
in space. Your only other alternatives are fossil fuels or nuclear<br>
(fusion or fission.) Burning fossil fuels to convert the energy to<br>
photonc to then reconvert it to plant mass is horribly inefficient.<br>
why not engineer a bug to convert the fuel directly?<br>
<p>
For green plants, it's cheaper to build single-level greenhouses.<br>
The reason we have farms instead of greenhouses is  ... economics!<br>
if greehouses were more cost-effective, farmers would install them.<br>
It's true that governments interfere with the economics of the<br>
agriculural<br>
sector more than with any other, but the underlying economics are<br>
still there.<br>
