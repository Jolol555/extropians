_The Wealth of Nations_ was published in 1776, Charlie. Not that being <br>
formulated in the 1920's or being anti-Communist is necessarily a<br>
disqualifier for an idea. Hell of a lot of good ideas are from the <br>
20's, are anti-Communist, or both.<br>

Oh, now the members of the list are tasked with advancing the state<br>
of the art in economics. Do we even have an economist on the list<br>
anymore? Or anyone who can speak for the field? I was under the <br>
impression that there were "proofs," to the extent economics supports <br>
such, of optimality of free markets. <br>
<p>
You're suffering from a dislocated onus here. The evidence of failure<br>
of non-free-market solutions is abundant. Yes, there *may* be a method<br>
of computing something more optimal, under some set of assumptions, in<br>
some cases. There could even be a general method that allocates costs<br>
incrementally better than a free market (I suspect you'd have to <br>
start with some definitions of optimality that assume what you're <br>
trying to prove, though). There's not even a candidate idea, after all <br>
the statist schemes that have been tried. Without at least the germ of <br>
a workable idea, you're asking us to look for a chimera.<br>
<p>
One reason this whole conflict of ideas is chronic and irreducible is <br>
the limits of economics itself. Simplest example I've seen of that is <br>
that in the healthcare discussion, whatever scheme we work under <br>
implicitly assigns some cash value to a human life, whereas we all like <br>
to think of our lives as infinitely valuable. Also, different people <br>
put different values on freedom, or come into the discussion with all <br>
kinds of dysfunctional memes like "the rights of society" or "the duty <br>
of altruism."<br>
<p>
"Intangibles", also, are by definition hard to quantify. You just have<br>
to leave every actor in charge of his or her own valuations of them,<br>
with exceptions (e.g., goodwill is intangible but people often agree<br>
on a specific value for it).<br>
<p>
Taking a quick leap here, at the risk of being critical without having <br>
the data to back it up, I also suspect that different economic axioms <br>
lead economists to collect and interpret data differently. I would not <br>
be surprised to find some detailed criticism of the field along these <br>
lines. Maybe a paper from the 20's ?&lt;G&gt;.<br>
<p>
In the meantime, as others have said, the free market is simple, works <br>
extremely well, and the alternatives by definition require coercion. <br>
