To an Extropian, this news is scary stuff. Note what Chirac says: he's not<br>
just working on an international ban on human cloning, but on any genetic<br>
alterations to human beings. Goodbye one path to posthumanity!<br>
<p>
If the British are the only country to resist, maybe I'll have to move<br>
back. [Natasha--want to live in London?]<br>

PARIS (January 12, 1998 4:08 p.m. EST <a href="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</a>) -- Hours after<br>
French President Jacques Chirac called for a world ban on human cloning, 19<br>
European nations signed an agreement Monday to prohibit genetic replication<br>
of humans.<br>
<p>
The actions came two days after President Clinton blasted a Chicago<br>
physicist's intention to clone humans as "untested and unsafe and morally<br>
unacceptable" and urged Congress to outlaw human cloning.<br>
<p>
"It is on the international level that one must ban cloning and the genetic<br>
manipulation susceptible to altering the character of the human species,"<br>
Chirac told the European national ethics committee.<br>
<p>
The July 1997 presentation of Dolly the sheep, the world's first cloned<br>
mammal, set off an international outcry over the implications for human<br>
biology.<br>
<p>
Many world leaders renewed their condemnation after Chicago scientist<br>
Richard Seed said Jan. 7 that he planned to begin working on human cloning<br>
using a new technique.<br>
<p>
"We would resolve nothing in banning certain practices in one country if<br>
the doctors and researchers can develop them elsewhere," said Chirac,<br>
citing the "worrying trend" in the United States.<br>
<p>
Representatives from 19 members of the Council of Europe later today signed<br>
a protocol that would commit their countries to prohibiting by law "any<br>
intervention seeking to create human beings genetically identical to<br>
another human being, whether living or dead."<br>
<p>
The 40-member group was founded in 1949 to promote democracy, human rights<br>
and the rule of law.<br>
<p>
The cloning protocol will not include two of Europe's biggest countries.<br>
<p>
Germany claims the measure is weaker than a current German law that forbids<br>
all research on human embryos -- a legacy of Nazis attempts to conduct<br>
genetic engineering of humans.<br>
<p>
Britain, with a strong tradition of defending the freedoms of scientific<br>
research, also balked.<br>
<p>
Countries signing today are: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece,<br>
Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Moldova, Norway, Portugal, Romania, San<br>
Marino, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Macedonia and Turkey.<br>
