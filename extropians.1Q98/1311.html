<i>&gt; &gt; MY NOTE: This means that a defendant can deny that he committed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; crime, and then claim that the reason he committed it was because he</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; was entrapped. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The law is full of strange loops like this, but this one can also be</i><br>
<i>&gt; unravelled less strangely (and less entertainingly): "My client denies</i><br>
<i>&gt; participating in the act in question, but even if the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; perpetrator were here on trial, the prosecution's case is tainted by</i><br>
<i>&gt; entrapment."</i><br>
<p>
Actually, there's no need at all to resort to such circumlocutions.<br>
While sworn testimony must be consistent, pleadings need not come<br>
even close.  The standard lawyer's joke in this regard is "Your<br>
honor, our claims are that (1) the plaintiff's injuries were not<br>
the result of a dog bite, (2) it couldn't have been my dog that bit<br>
him because it was tied up, (3) if my dog did bite him, it was because<br>
the plaintiff provoked him when passing my yard, and (4) I don't<br>
have a dog."<br>
