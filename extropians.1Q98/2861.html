<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; The description 'socialist' hardly fits [China], though. It's a capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; dictatorship with a red flag.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;So it isn't free enterprise, right? Its an oligopoly. They claim to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;socialists as a general matter of propaganda, but so did the communists...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Nothing is really different with the minor exception that they don't shoot</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;foreign reporters as spies anymore.</i><br>

<i>&gt; Free enterprise in the way you define it cannot exist. When liberating an</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy, existing economic power structures will try to manifestate their</i><br>
<i>&gt; powers in other forms of government or the same form as before, because they</i><br>
<i>&gt; need a tool to exploit the majority of the population.</i><br>
<p>
That power structures "try" to maintain themselves in new conditions is<br>
not persuasive - hardly even interesting.  What's interesting is if they<br>
always *succeed*.<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; The best definition of freedom probably comes from the anarcho-socialists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Not being oppressed by power structures while, at the same time, helping to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; advance evolution. Such a freedom is entirely impossible in a "free market".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Evolution of what? And how?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Evolution of humanity. Through progress. By spreading information.</i><br>
<p>
Information can't spread in a "free market"??  Go peddle your slogans to<br>
the gullible.<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;You cannot create change without force and the use</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of power. Human nature is wired against change, for the most part.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your main problem is that you don't have much fantasy. Your worldview is</i><br>
<i>&gt; much too limited. I have said it about 283475 times: You can only advance</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolution if you bring the necessary information to those who are "in</i><br>
<i>&gt; command" or will be someday. It's absolutely irrelevant whether these people</i><br>
<i>&gt; are economic or political leaders, it's just important that they have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; power to change things and the intelligence to understand what you tell</i><br>
<i>&gt; them.</i><br>
<p>
So?  It's not hard to find someone who is "in command" of a small part<br>
of the economy, enough to take advantage of such "information".  Take<br>
off those class-war glasses.<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;On the contrary, the Church was the only thing that preserved the knowledge of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the Romans.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 99 % of all books and important information from the Empire were destroyed</i><br>
<i>&gt; later.  [...]</i><br>
<p>
No contradiction there.<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
<i>&gt; You see, there was a reason why we decided to call "Homo Excelsior" "The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Transhumanist's Magazine". A transhumanist is someone who strives to become</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhuman. A transhuman is someone who has managed to transcend human</i><br>
<i>&gt; conditions. A posthuman is someone whose conditions are so entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt; different from that of a biological human or transhuman that it cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; really be called human anymore. Are these definitions OK for you?</i><br>
<p>
Dunno about him, but they're OK for me.<br>
