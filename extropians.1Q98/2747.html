Actually, Spacewatch is funded, but not heavily. It appears to have primary<br>
viewing rights<br>
to its little Kitt Peak 36" telescope. It uses it 20 nights a month. On the<br>
other nights, the moon<br>
is too bright for this purpose. apparently, the only other funded continuous<br>
effort<br>
is NEAR, which runs 6 nights a month on a Air Force "scope in Hawaii. Total<br>
funding<br>
for both projects is less than $1M/year. The projects have mapped about 10% of<br>
the<br>
space they need to map for good coverage of earth-crossing asteriods, which make<br>
up<br>
about 90 percent of the threat. Not surprisingly, SpaceWatch has found most of<br>
the<br>
108 objects regarded as "potentially hazerdous", including 1997XF11. Spacewatch<br>
seems to be a professor and some grad students. NEAR seems to be a professor,<br>
an administrator, and some grad students.<br>
<p>
Statitistically, this says to be that there are probably ten more out there that<br>
<p>
are at least as dangerous as this one and that could be identified with just a<br>
little bit<br>
of funding.<br>
<p>
Amateur astronomers contribute greatly to this effort. The Pros find the rocks<br>
and<br>
publish their initial position, and the amateurs then track them and refine the<br>
orbits.<br>
This is why Spacewatch found this puppy in decenber but the news about the<br>
near miss didn't surface until today.<br>
<p>
The other 10 percent of the problem are comets coming in from the outer Solar<br>
system.<br>
It will take a lot more observing time and/or bigger scopes to see these guys in<br>
time<br>
to do anythinbg about them.<br>
