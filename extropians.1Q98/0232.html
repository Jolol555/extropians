When I was in the Army, we devised a pretty good heating system on a<br>
particularly cold night, though not as cold as where you are. <br>
<p>
The US Army issues these cheap chemical heaters (just add water) for the<br>
MRE's they issue in the field.  The heaters are nothing more than a piece<br>
of cardboard with chemical crystals in it, about 15cm x 8cm, weighing next<br>
to nothing.  We would find a 2-liter jar or bottle, rip up a bunch of MRE<br>
heaters, and loosely pack the jar about halfway full with crystals and<br>
cardboard.  We would then add water until the jar was about 3/4 full.<br>
<p>
This would generate a terrific amount of heat for a couple hours, getting<br>
cooler with time.  For about the first hour or so it would be too hot to<br>
touch, but cool enough that it didn't melt the plastic (~140 deg. F?).  In<br>
a relatively sealed environment, it was actually quite effective at warming<br>
up a tent.<br>
<p>
One word of warning though: it creates a small quantity of somewhat noxious<br>
gas (acetic acid?).  We solved this problem by duct taping a hose to the<br>
mouth of the jar and feeding the end out a small crack in the door.  <br>
<p>
Using this kind of heater takes practice and finesse to maximize the useful<br>
output for the longest possible time, but it is reasonably effective once<br>
mastered and the chemical MRE heaters are cheap, light, and flameless.<br>
<p>
(You can create mildly amusing explosions by mixing heater crystals and<br>
water in a sealed container.)<br>
<p>
Enjoy...<br>
