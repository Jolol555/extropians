<i>&gt; I wasn't talking philosophy, I was talking about a practical way to get </i><br>
<i>&gt; things done. It doesn't matter why people own anything in the first place, </i><br>
<i>&gt; the fact is that in the real world they do and we must deal with it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
      If we're talking comparative economic systems and reasons for <br>
      choosing between them, we _are_ -- ineluctably -- doing philosophy.<br>
<p>
      We have to start from where we are if we want to get anywhere else, <br>
      and to start 'here' we have to know what 'here' is, and how it came <br>
      to be.  We can't design and build a ship from scratch in mid-ocean <br>
      (nor can we tear the existing ship to pieces, then hope to be able <br>
      to build a new ship).  We can gradually remodel the whole ship from <br>
      stem to stern, however, in a  way that's nearer to our hearts' and <br>
      our minds' desires.<br>
      <br>
<i>        &gt;No-one has ever provided a satisfying explanation of how a person         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;comes to 'own' a given piece of land from a state of nature.         </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So what?</i><br>
<p>
        So the history and the rationale affects the validity of the <br>
        claims to title.  It's an unavoidable problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; People undoubtedly do own land</i><br>
<p>
        Who owns land in the Falklands/Malvinas, say?  Or Red China?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and if you believe in determinism, and I'll bet you do</i><br>
<p>
        I'm not sure that 'determiniosm' is the word you meant to use.<br>
<p>
        I'm certainly not a determinist in any sense of the word other <br>
        than that I'm not a Copenhagen-school subjectivist 'quantum <br>
        indeterminist.'<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Then there must be a reason that they do, you just don't know what it </i><br>
<i>&gt; is. Even if you did have an explanation, of what practical value could</i><br>
<i>&gt; it possibly be?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
        "Some men see things as they are, and ask 'Why?'<br>
         But I saw things that never were, and asked 'Why not?'"<br>
         <br>
         -- Aeschylus, 400 BCE. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     &gt;The 'labour-mixing' argument doesn't hold water. [...].The 'resources        </i><br>
<i>      &gt;-mixing' argument begs the first question      </i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; That could be, but I wouldn't know. What are those arguments?</i><br>
<p>
      You'll find the basic propertarian models neatly summarized in <br>
      Harvard philosophy professor Robert Nozick's brilliant (and <br>
      award-winning) work of libertarian philosophy, "Anarch, State and <br>
      Utopia."  Since Nozick offers the only really viable alternative to <br>
      John Rawls' "A Theory of Justice" (another lovely book), we have to <br>
      deal with these problems if we want to compete for 'hearts and <br>
      minds' in the political philosophy marketplace.  And win!<br>
      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt;Why is your labour not just wasted effort?        </i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; If your labor is foolish then it is wasted effort, not all labor is of </i><br>
<i>&gt; equal value, or of any value at all. The great thing about the market is that it </i><br>
<i>&gt; will tell  you very quickly if you're working smart or stupid.</i><br>
<p>
      Think of the problem like this.  You find a piece of driftwood, and <br>
      carve it into a sculpture.  You've now mixed your (intellectual, <br>
      artistic and physical) labour with the driftwood, right?  If I take <br>
      the sculpture while you are sleeping, you'll be pissed off  when you <br>
      wake up and find it gone.  If you find I've sold your scultpure and <br>
      kept the money, you'll consider that you've suffered an _injustice_, <br>
      because _you_ had a just claim on the sculpture.<br>
<p>
      It's the idea of _justice in property claims_  we're  discussing all <br>
      the while, when we discuss different systems of property rights.<br>
      <br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;Look back far enough, and you find something pretty questionable         </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;(or outright predatory). </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Look back far enough, and you can find anything you want.</i><br>
<p>
        Not so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's pointless to worry about what a bunch of dead men I never met did </i><br>
<i>&gt;  another bunch &gt; of dead men I never met.</i><br>
<p>
        So how do _you_ adjudicate Aboriginal land rights claims?<br>
<p>
        Abdicate the responsibility?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I just want the best system for making me rich, free, and happy</i><br>
<p>
        I want this for _all_ of us, not just for me.<br>
<p>
        I'm not comfortable with a system where 350 000 children starve to <br>
        death each day, or die of avoidable illness.  Are you?  Imagine <br>
        them sitting all around you while you lecture them on the virtues <br>
        of the free market, as they're dying.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; it certainly isn't socialism.</i><br>
<p>
        It certainly isn't State Socialism without market prices, fer <br>
        sure!  But the original dream of Socialism -- a society where, <br>
        within reason, everyone can have what they want and do what they <br>
        like, is an ideal that _is_ worth striving for, however <br>
        imperfectly we may achieve it in practice.  I think market <br>
        liberalism can do this much better than State Socialism, is all.  <br>
        Democratic Agorism can do better still.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt;How, precisely, do you assert 'your' exclusive property claim to       </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;_anything_, without   threatening to initiate _violence_ againt a       </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;non-violent 'intruder'?        </i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Obviously you can not, who said you could?    </i><br>
<p>
        But there's the -- coercive -- core of the 'taxation' issue:  'A' <br>
        threatens to initiate violence against 'B' to gain or retain <br>
        property.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's of absolutely no concern to me because the perpetrators of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; injustice as well as the victims have all been dead for a thousand years.</i><br>
<p>
        "How can'st be pardon'd, yet retain th'offence?"<br>
        <br>
         <br>
<i>&gt; I don't believe in object[ive] morality but I do think it would be nice </i><br>
<i>&gt; if most people were free and rich most of the time.</i><br>
<p>
        Sure sounds objectively moral to me!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If your goal is a happy creative world you will never achieve it by </i><br>
<i>&gt; trying [to] avenge every ancient crime.</i><br>
<p>
        I'm not trying to avenge historical crimes (though they do make me <br>
        angry) so much as to rectify _present injustices_.  Insofar as the <br>
        better-off tend to be the beneficiaries of past injustices, while <br>
        the worst-off tend to be descendants of their victims, there is a <br>
        real moral and practical problem to be addressed.  If we don't <br>
        others with less palatable ideologies will -- Fundamentalist <br>
        Islamicists, State Socialists, Fascists, the list goes on...<br>
        <br>
        Much of the US Constitution was taken from the Code of the <br>
        Iroquois League...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt; Why does 'capital' hire 'labour'? Why does not 'labour' hire        </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;'capital' for time-preference (interest) plus a risk factor?  </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That's exactly what happens when a working man gets a loan from a bank </i><br>
<i>&gt; and buys a house.</i><br>
<p>
        What I have in  mind are worker-cooperatives (look at Mondragon in <br>
        Spain); and consortiums of workers.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt;Why do we still have a _hierarchical_ - 'Crony-Capitalist' --       </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;verticalist structure for our prevailing version of a 'free-market'         </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;society, when most people would prefer a much more 'horizontal'         </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;reticular --  Agorist! --  pattern of economic interactions?</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can't answer your question because I have no idea what your question </i><br>
<i>&gt; is.</i><br>
<p>
<i>       &gt;:-}  Networks of independent traders as discussed by e.g. David </i><br>
       Friedman (see 'The Machinery of Freedom').<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;       &gt;we have to adapt our vector-driven catallactic economic systems to </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;the 21st Century.       </i><br>
<p>
                                                  <br>
<i>&gt; Right. Ah, ... Is your vector-driven catallactic fuel injection or does</i><br>
<i>&gt; it have a carburetor?                                </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;:-}  &gt;:-}  OK, so that'll teach me to be pretentious!  Serve me </i><br>
        right, too!  But it does mean something neat, actually.<br>
        <br>
        'Vectors' are forces with both direction and magnitude.  Just like <br>
        profit margins in the exchange ratios (or 'market prices') in the <br>
        'market-price system'  (or 'catallaxy' in Austrian Economics <br>
        jargon).<br>
<p>
        Thanks!  That was fun!<br>
