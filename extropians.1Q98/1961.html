<i>&gt; I have similar reservations as to putting a large investment into a</i><br>
<i>&gt; tropical island.  Many of the tropical islands have very little elevation</i><br>
<i>&gt; above sea level.  Any number of natural occurences (large storm surge,</i><br>
<i>&gt; tsunami, oceanic meteor impact) could have devastating consequences.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Additionally, most of the smaller islands are not much more than</i><br>
<i>&gt; sand-logged coral reefs with only marginally substantial foundations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; While fine for a tropical bungalow, I would be more hesitant to build a</i><br>
<i>&gt; really large structure on top of it.  Tropical islands with solid volcanic</i><br>
<i>&gt; or tectonic origins *are* plentiful, but tend to be significantly larger</i><br>
<i>&gt; (i.e. expensive) than their more affordable and smaller reef-based brethren.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is why I would seriously consider the Alaskan/Canadian coastal</i><br>
<i>&gt; islands.  These islands are built of some of the oldest, hardest rock*(see</i><br>
<i>&gt; below) on the planet, and many are more than 1000 feet in elevation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Additionally, this is one of the calmest coastlines on the Pacific Ocean;</i><br>
<i>&gt; the water is *glassy*.  Plenty of fresh water, lots of timber, all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; seafood you can catch/eat, and a very mild climate (similar to Washington</i><br>
<i>&gt; state).  I initially visited the area only after my parents moved there</i><br>
<i>&gt; (for a scant two years) and immediately fell in love with the place.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of more interest to many on this list is that there is no practical force</i><br>
<i>&gt; of law in these areas.  Local laws are, for all intents and purposes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; absolute.  Visiting the local communities is a real-life demonstration of</i><br>
<i>&gt; how this can be very good or very bad, depending on the constitution of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular community.  In areas where strong self-discipline is the social</i><br>
<i>&gt; norm, these islands are nearly a libertarian mecca; you can do whatever you</i><br>
<i>&gt; want as long as you don't harm anyone else.  However, there are some</i><br>
<i>&gt; islands that are essentially malevolent oligarchies/dictatorships, with all</i><br>
<i>&gt; the usual bad things associated.  As an odd twist to the normal state of</i><br>
<i>&gt; affairs, the Alaskan government has more money than it knows what to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; with (oil revenues; there are no taxes in Alaska) and will gladly fund all</i><br>
<i>&gt; sorts of schools/ventures/projects just to spend it for the benefit of</i><br>
<i>&gt; improving the image of the state.  One of their latest greatest projects is</i><br>
<i>&gt; to spend their excess funds on wiring the entire state with fiber and</i><br>
<i>&gt; high-speed switches in the attempt to turn Alaska into something resembling</i><br>
<i>&gt; a high-tech state (even if they *are* missing the tech people).  Quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; frankly, there is a decent possibility that Alaska would sell you an island</i><br>
<i>&gt; "pennies on the dollar" if you promised to bring a whole lot of high-tech</i><br>
<i>&gt; expertise with you.  As I said, the southern coastal islands are *not* bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; places to live, if a bit underdeveloped.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If I was to consider a permanent location for an Extropian country (per</i><br>
<i>&gt; se), this would be my best choice based on what I know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Good points. However, the main problem in establishing an Extropian<br>
country (as I'm sure you know) is not finding some suitable land one<br>
could buy (there are a number of islands on the market, and many more<br>
could be had with enough cash) , but obtaining sovereignty. You might be<br>
able to buy an island in Alaska, but Washington is not going to let you<br>
form your own country, even if you are Bill Gates. One might be able to<br>
buy sovereignty from a smaller, poorer country however.<br>
<p>
Although you might consider the climate on the coast of Alaska "mild," I<br>
believe a tropical location would have much more appeal to most people<br>
despite the problems you mention. Hurricanes could be avoided by picking<br>
an island near the equator. I agree that a coral atoll would be a bad<br>
choice, but why not investigate decent volcanic islands in the tropics?<br>
