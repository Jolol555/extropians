I am only aware of one widely utilized standard for optical transmission of<br>
digital audio, usually referred to as the ADAT Optical Digital Interface<br>
(also known as a "Lite Pipe" interface or simply an "Optical Digital<br>
Interface").  I am not sure if it actually originated with the ADAT (it may<br>
have simply popularized it), but it is supported as a standard for optically<br>
networking digital audio by several manufacturers of audio equipment.  <br>
<p>
I am not sure of the exact specs, but this interface will carry at least 8<br>
channels of uncompressed Red Book audio (44.1 kHz sample rate,<br>
16-bits/sample).  I believe it is capable of considerably more than this,<br>
but I can't say for sure.  I know it allows for the basic routing of<br>
multiple audio channels through an optical network (you could do some<br>
fantastic stuff with this in your house if you are an audiophile), but I<br>
don't know of anyone who has tried this over a standard data network.  Some<br>
higher end consumer electronics have built in support for Lite Pipe<br>
interfaces, or you can buy a converter box for systems that don't include<br>
support.<br>
<p>
More information is available at on the Alesis site at:  <a href="http://www.alesis.com">http://www.alesis.com</a><br>

Hope this helps.<br>
