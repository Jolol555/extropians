My guess is that the messages you posted to the List were not delivered<br>
to some subscriber to the List.  The List sends out messages with your<br>
"From:" address to indicate it was from you.  The subscriber's server<br>
sent you the bounce message since it could not deliver e-mail from you.<br>
<p>
The message in question went from your Netscape 3.04 Gold on Windows NT,<br>
through smtp e-mail, to the Extropians List MajorDomo list server,<br>
through smpt e-mail, through an RFC822 to X.400 Gateway, through a<br>
government ATTMAIL service, through a cc:Mail server to a subscriber who<br>
apparently wasn't there.  I'm not suprised if the bounce message back to<br>
you was in error or was not clear.<br>
