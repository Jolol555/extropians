Portable telephones have become so cheap that I recently decided to get one<br>
and see whether it makes a difference in my life.  So I dropped in at the<br>
Sprint* sales office across the street from where I earn my daily bread --<br>
and was asked for my pSeudo Security Number, for a credit check.  "I'm not<br>
going to further compromise my privacy for a luxury," I said, and left.<br>
<p>
But maybe that was a pointless gesture...<br>

(*Sprint is one of the four biggest telephone companies here)<br>
