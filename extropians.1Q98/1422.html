<p>
They *** DO *** collude. Almost all the European PTTs are either state<br>
owned, or were state owned until recently -- the exception, British Telecom,<br>
was part of the post office until privatisation in 1982.<br>
<p>
In the UK, the main NSA/GCHQ tap is at Menwith Hill. They plug into BT's<br>
microwave and fibre-optic backbone; you can see the receivers from miles<br>
away, over the moors. I kid you not, the monitoring operation is out in the<br>
open and it is huge. There's a whole network of GCHQ interfaces with the<br>
civilian telecoms infrastructure around the UK; prod me hard enough and I'll<br>
try to dig up some of my referances and repost them.<br>
<p>
In 1945 the UK and USA signed a joint intelligence sharing treaty. The way<br>
I hear it, NSA isn't allowed to spy on US citizens at home, and GCHQ isn't<br>
allowed to spy on UK citizens at home. That's why there are joint GCHQ/NSA<br>
monitoring posts -- makes it easier to share intelligence, if you follow my<br>
drift.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) With serious compression, a phone call can be squeezed to an average of</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps 500bytes/sec. There are probably an average of at least one million</i><br>
<i>&gt; simulatneous phone calls in europe at any time. This is 500 megabytes (4 gigabits)</i><br>
<i>&gt; per second, requiring 43.2 terabytes of storage per day. the compression would</i><br>
<i>&gt; require roughly one million very competent DSPs. automatic keyword recognition</i><br>
<i>&gt; equipment would require at least an additional 2 miooion DSPs.</i><br>
<p>
So? I've heard estimates that as much as 10% of all the CPU power in the UK<br>
is owned/operated by GCHQ. NSA spends billions on supercomputers per year.<br>
You think those are doing nothing?<br>
<p>
A little tidbit. System X and System Y digital telephone exchanges made in<br>
the UK are the backbone for BT, and are exported around the world. An <br>
interesting feature the recent EU report highlighted is that it's possible<br>
to program the exchange to make any ISDN TA connected to it go "off hook"<br>
for monitoring -- in effect, turning the entire collection of terminals<br>
plugged into such an exchange into a massive array of infinity repeaters.<br>
It's no surprise that Russia and China have both bought into this<br>
technology ...<br>
