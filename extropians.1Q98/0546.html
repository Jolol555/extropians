  If I got one red cent from your investigation of Neo-Tech I suppose<br>
you could call it a plug. However, I don't. When I mention Neo-Tech<br>
it is usually because it is very pertinent to the debate at hand.<br>
Neo-Tech is a very large body of thought completely different to<br>
what most of you have been exposed to in the past. Therefore it is<br>
easier for me to reference it than to explain it.<br>
   As I see it, Neo-Tech could be the plutonium in the engine of<br>
Extropian goals(nanotechnology, biological immortality, etc.) but<br>
if it bothers you that much I suppose that I will keep it to myself.<br>
