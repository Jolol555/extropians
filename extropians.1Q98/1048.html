<i>&gt; carry on preaching to the choir.</i><br>
<p>
A complete and unrestricted free market with property rights IS a <br>
solution to this.<br>
<p>
However, there are a few potential practical problems in implementing <br>
such a system.  Those problems are mostly of the sort of "how do you <br>
define, recognise, and enforce property rights to..."<br>
<p>
A few examples:<br>
<p>
 * clean air -- which gets blown all over the place<br>
 * water -- which flows, in most cases eventually into the ocean<br>
 * wild creatures, most particularly mobile sea creatures (e.g. fish)<br>
<p>
The development of economics generally has been a process of <br>
internalizing costs and benefits -- that is, making sure that the <br>
person who makes the decision reaps the benefits *and* pays the <br>
consequences.  The end of slavery (not just chattel slavery, but also <br>
feudual serfdom) internalized the tradeoff between more leisure and <br>
more labor, between taking it easy and working hard&amp;smart.  The <br>
enclosure movement internalized the cost of damage to the land.  <br>
Every instance of a cost being internalized has been followed by a <br>
general increase in prosperity.  We haven't finished these increases <br>
in prosperity, but we really do need to be internalizing the cost of <br>
pollution (and right now, with current environmental laws, government <br>
is the single biggest obstacle to that process).<br>
<p>
I have the right to dump garbage on my land, as long as it doesn't <br>
threaten or damage the neighbors.  I should have an equal right to <br>
dump garbage into the air over my land.  At the same time, I don't <br>
have the right to dump garbage on my neighbor's land, and I shouldn't <br>
have the right to dump garbage into the air over my neighbor's <br>
land.<br>
<p>
Right now, either I am punished for dumping garbage into the air over <br>
my land, without regard to its impact on the neighbors (and the <br>
neighbors get no compensation for any negative impact); or I am <br>
granted the privilege of dumping garbage into the air over my <br>
neighbor's land (with no compensation to the neighbors); and it is <br>
the government that decides.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;Alternative: a political system that is not amenable to bribery,        </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;nepotism, or corruption and that follows the old dictum of kings that         </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;"he who rules best, rules least". </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Any political system will work perfectly in a population of brilliant saints, </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ... which I think we agree the real world is sadly lacking ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the difference is that the Free Market will work, not perfectly, but pretty  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; damn well even with real flesh and blood human beings, probably intelligent </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; machines too.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It works better than any of the known alternatives, I'll concede that</i><br>
<i>&gt; much. Question: why the hell isn't anyone looking for new, hitherto-unknown,</i><br>
<i>&gt; alternatives?</i><br>
<p>
Look at what the relatively unsuccessful systems have in common: <br>
concentration of political power, as compared to the successful <br>
systems.<br>
<p>
But if political power is not concentrated, what people actually do <br>
is free-market capitalism.<br>
<p>
You cannot ENFORCE any alternative to free-market capitalism, except <br>
by means that are already known to be worse than free-market <br>
capitalism.  And if you don't enforce the alternative, you won't get <br>
the alternative.<br>
