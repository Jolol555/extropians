<i>&gt; From:          Harvey Newstrom &lt;harv@gate.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I just realized what bothers me about this whole mess...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't care if Clinton had an affair.  I don't see the Moral Outrage as</i><br>
<i>&gt; being an important issue.  What is important (legally) is if he tampered</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a witness to lie about it.  That would be criminal, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But if this is the case, and Clinton is guilty, what does this mean?  He</i><br>
<i>&gt; is guilty of tampering with the investigation of allegations.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; totally ignores the original allegations or whether an original crime</i><br>
<i>&gt; was committed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would hate to see a President brought down as a result of his reaction</i><br>
<i>&gt; to an investigation, and not due to guilt involving the original</i><br>
<i>&gt; allegations that prompted the investigation.</i><br>
<p>
The ONLY violation of law they ever established even to the <br>
probable-cause level, that Nixon had actually done, was participating <br>
in a cover-up.  THAT is what brought Nixon down.<br>
<p>
Clinton, if current reports bear up, is guilty of exactly the same <br>
thing and possibly to a greater degree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  This implies that a person</i><br>
<i>&gt; can be investigated and eventually found guilty because of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; investigation without any crime prior to the investigation being</i><br>
<i>&gt; required.  This vaguely reminds me of entrapment, whereby the person's</i><br>
<i>&gt; reaction to the police investigation is deemed criminal, and the person</i><br>
<i>&gt; is charged based on this and not based on any activity occurring prior</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the investigation.</i><br>
<p>
No, entrapment per se is somewhat different.  What you are thinking <br>
of is cases where all charges against a person are dropped except <br>
"resisting arrest".  That is now not acceptable in court: if there <br>
isn't enough of a case to prosecute, then the arrest was not <br>
justified.<br>
<p>
Arresting someone directly interferes with their freedom.  <br>
Investigating them does not.<br>
<p>
Entrapment is when (for example) an undercover police officer <br>
instigates a crime so that other participants can be arrested.  There <br>
is not compelling reason to believe that, absent police <br>
encouragement, a crime would have occurred.<br>
