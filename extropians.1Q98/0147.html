<i>&gt;even given the advances in NMR.</i><br>
<p>
If we can narrow the scope of what to check down enough, I think we can<br>
avoid having some huge nightmarish machine.  I would suggest starting off<br>
with measuring only a few parameters, then adding capabilities as science<br>
advances.<br>
<p>
My first concerns would be making it easy to use, reliable, and cheap.<br>
Later we can add on comprehensiveness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; As a practical aside, which specific dimensions would be most useful to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; measure?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think a blood-test device would be useful, if limited. Maybe also</i><br>
<i>&gt;some kind of tissue-mechanics test (collagene flexibility, skin</i><br>
<i>&gt;properties).</i><br>
<p>
I would think also urine analysis, perhaps done spectrally or through a<br>
gas chromatograph.  No, even that sounds a bit much.<br>
<p>
How about finding out what basically goes wrong -- i.e., what chemical<br>
changes happen in blood, urine, etc. -- and developing simple solution<br>
tests for those?  In other words, mix 1cc of blood with the kit's blood test<br>
solution A and depending on what color it changes, this tells you if blood<br>
LDL levels are too high?<br>
<p>
Something like this might prove marketable now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My own interest is of course cognition. I have for a long time planned</i><br>
<i>&gt;to write a cognitive test suite in java, so that one can objectively</i><br>
<i>&gt;test one's progress, effects of lifestyle, age, nootropics etc without</i><br>
<i>&gt;the hassle. Another fun idea I have been thinking of is some kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;reverse neuropsychology test: you undertake a detailled mental test,</i><br>
<i>&gt;from which your neurotransmittor levels could be roughly estimated</i><br>
<i>&gt;(useful to tune nootropics). But right now these are pipe dreams. </i><br>
<p>
I can imagine doing very simple tests, such as those of reaction time to<br>
visual stimuli combined with a measurement of neurotransmitter levels...<br>
<p>
This is not as glamorous as the other two you mention, but if we start<br>
out with a simpler goal we might achieve it, market it, and move on to<br>
some more complex/interesting.<br>
