<p>
We can infer that "other persons" is a generic term and doesn't apply<br>
exclusively to slaves (it clearly, for example, includes Indians who<br>
aren't taxed). If they meant 'only count slaves as 3/5 of a person,<br>
but count everyone else' they would have said so. Slaves are clearly<br>
counted as "other people", but so, for example, are untaxed Indians.<br>
<p>
The real question is, what did they mean by "free persons"? Once we<br>
know that we can work out who the "other persons" are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not exactly.  Remember, not all free Persons were voters -- indeed there</i><br>
<i>&gt;are still at least two classes of free nonvoters: minors and resident</i><br>
<i>&gt;aliens.  Even "illegal aliens" are counted (I believe this was decided</i><br>
<i>&gt;in a suit over the census of 1980).</i><br>
<p>
But what some suit in 1980 said is irrelevant; the question is what they<br>
meant at the time they wrote the Constitution, since the founders are the<br>
ones who supposedly regarded slaves as 'subhuman'. The plain fact remains<br>
that the 3/5 rule made perfect sense at the time, but is today being used<br>
by authoritarians to denigrate them.<br>
