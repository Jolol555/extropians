<i>&gt;Can you think of short scenes from movies or TV that would illustrate</i><br>
<i>&gt;humans transforming? (Or images good for other sections such as on</i><br>
<i>&gt;cryonics, nano, AI, uploading, etc.)</i><br>
<p>
I believe there is a scene in the movie Star Wars in which a character's<br>
hand is cut off with a light saber. (Luke Skywalker might be the<br>
character.) In a later scene the character is depicted exercising a new<br>
biomechanical prosthesis which replaces the hand. I have not seen this<br>
movie in years so I do not recall the details. <br>
<p>
The title character in the movie Robocop might be considered a sympathetic<br>
portrayal of a transformed human. The transformation was involuntary and<br>
it is not depicted as entirely positive, but the character is presented<br>
with affirmation, and he clearly has enhanced capabilities. <br>
<p>
The Lawnmower Man has interesting imagery. Unfortunately, it is a horror<br>
film with an unsympathetic main character. Also, the imagery is largely<br>
metaphorical and might compound confusion. However, there is one scene of<br>
abstract "lovemaking" that might illustrate uploads communing in a<br>
constructed reality.<br>
<p>
There was a PBS special with Jeff Goldblum that treated nanotechnology<br>
which contained a variety of imagery some of which might be useful.<br>
