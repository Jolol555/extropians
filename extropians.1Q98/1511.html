Berrie Staring &lt;staring@worldonline.nl&gt; had some great things to say:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The society is everything but "cold", it's dynamic and does a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt; based on emotions.</i><br>
<p>
	Exactly, but people don't see this. SF has so much horror in<br>
it.  cryonics is in no way portrayed in a "warm and fuzzy" way<br>
although it could very easily be done so.<br>
<p>
	I was raised in the LDS church.  Have you ever been to the LDS<br>
"Temple Square" in SLC?  That is a good example of "warm and fuzzy"<br>
and that is why they are growing the way they are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; According to a lot of you, Jim's book the "The First Immortal" can</i><br>
<i>&gt; do a lot for Cryonics. I say, let's use this moment to actively make</i><br>
<i>&gt; use of this and present an institute were people can learn more.</i><br>
<p>
	Take, for example, the cover of TFI.  I'm proud to have that<br>
book and would be very excited if some of my LDS family would pick it<br>
up to read it.  But as soon as they see the cold and cracked face<br>
cover, I'm sure a cold shiver goes through their spine.  These people<br>
evidently can't see past what the cover actually means.  They must<br>
have their warm and fuzzies served to them on a platter, like is done<br>
in the LDS temple square and so forth.  If there was a glorious<br>
colorful picture of a future world full of immortal people on the<br>
color or something, I might be able to get some of my kids to take an<br>
interrest.  But that cracked and cold face just turns people,<br>
especially women, right off with a shiver.<br>
