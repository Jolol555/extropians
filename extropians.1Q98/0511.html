<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; size range.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; guessitmate is that is feasible. The requirement for fusion is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; atoms must slam into each other fast enough. The requirement for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; useful fusion is "engineering breakeven": The process must emit</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more useful energy with no external input. In the particular</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; application we're discussing, the useful energy is low-intensity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; heat, which is the easiest goal to reach.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You must recover enough high quality energy to operate your device. So</i><br>
<i>&gt; far, all fusion devices need a lot of high quality energy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Correct, but that's why we want to use nanotech. You need "a lot"<br>
of high-quality energy because today's Fusion techologies are<br>
large. With nanotech, we may we able to get tne required energy<br>
density in a smaller space, meaning that we'll need less high-quality<br>
energy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; It's not proven that SL is blackbody rediation and therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; indicative of near-fusion conditions, and the phenomenon is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not well enough understood to find a useful set of conditions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; whereby you can extract useful energy: currently, SL is observed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; only at temperatured near the freezing point of water. Don't count</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; on SL for micro-fusion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; An announcement in Photonics Spectra (photonics trade magazine) stated</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a supercomputer simulation of SL, with the right kind of driving pulses</i><br>
<i>&gt; could reach fusion temperatures.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I personally believe that the weight of evidence favors high temperature<br>
as the source of the SL glow, and that the phenomenon we see on the <br>
lab bench, using equipment you can build at home, is in fact within<br>
a factor ot 4 of the (temp x density) needed for D-T fusion. However,<br>
The SBSL bubble must be maintained in the middle of a flask of water,<br>
and<br>
if the water temperature is much above freezing the phenomenon<br>
disappears. So, even if you can get fusion in the bubble, how do you<br>
propose to extract useful energy?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I envision an D-D fusion reactor based on a form of inertial-confinement</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fusion, using a truly tiny holraum and starting in an environment with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; very high static pressure. The environment is the center of a set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; diamondoid spheres, each of which contributes a megapascal or so of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pressure differential.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your geometry won't work. Each shell must be larger than the previous</i><br>
<i>&gt; one. In the end your maximum strength is no larger than that of the bulk</i><br>
<i>&gt; material.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
The strength of the bulk material should suffice. The point of the<br>
shells<br>
is to permit us to build a machine inside the resulting big diamond and<br>
to build machinery throughout the whole structure to perform the power<br>
generation and cleanup/repair functions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The D-D reaction emits no primary neutrons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The innermost sphere brings the interior static pressure up to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; highest level that remains consistent with diamondiod nanotech and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; diamondoid compressive and tensile strength. The nanotech machinery</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; contained within the inner shell then delivers a transient implosive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pulse to the holraum (mechanically, or with lasers, or with explosives)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to cause fusion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
John Clark pointed out that I had made a mistake: D-D fusion also emits<br>
neutrons. I should have checked references instead of relying on a<br>
clearly faulty memory. I'm certain that I recall a higher-temp<br>
neutronless<br>
fusion reaction: H-H perhaps?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I rather suspect that nanotech becomes quite limited at high pressures.</i><br>
<i>&gt; At extremely high pressures the forces of chemical bonds are of the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; magnitude and you just can't build nanotech.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Not sure on this. At extreme pressure, various phase changes occur,<br>
yielding crystals witb different properties. Why not build the innermost<br>
portions of the device from these? I can think of several serious<br>
objections, the most obvious being that a machine whose structures<br>
are only stable at extreme pressure must operate in a liquid or a gas,<br>
and nanotech is usually envisioned as working in a vacuum. In any event<br>
I'm not sure where diamondoid becomes unusable on the temp/pressure<br>
plane. Does someone have a reference? Remember: the diamondiod is<br>
used to bring the static environmental pressure up, the actual<br>
fusion pressure is generated dynamically as an increment on the<br>
static pressure, so the diamondoid doesn't need to maintain<br>
the full fusion pressure. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; This geherates a lot of heat, raising the temperature</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of th interior. The reactor uses the thermal gradient from inside to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; outside to capture the energy neeeded to drive the next pulse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; High pressure and temperature only reinforce my point.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Agreed. Given nano, you can get very efficient in every way. In</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; particular, forget the tent. Just reconfigure your body's resident</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; clothing nanos to provide an insulating skin of the type you describe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tents are nice, they provide privacy. Of course your clothing could</i><br>
<i>&gt; reconfigure into a tent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; BTW, I think a "mister fusion" is like backpacking a Winnebago...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Some elements capture neutrons very efficiently, but I want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; start with a reaction that doesn't emit neutrons at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ok. You have: Neutrons, skip those. Ok, energetic alphas - still capable</i><br>
<i>&gt; of considerable nano mayhem. (and you gotta have alphas, ok?). Then</i><br>
<i>&gt; there's betas, which have a range of inches, at least. OH, and I forgot</i><br>
<i>&gt; the gammas, with a range of several feet even in rock.... Nice device</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have here...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
We may need to use lead or worse even heaview metals to shield the<br>
gammas. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; It doesn't have to be efficient. It doesn't even have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; break even. It just has to be able to bust up these ugly big</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; radioactive isotopes that are not amenable to destruction by other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; means.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Using precious high quality energy here. I can see it now. 100 KW, of</i><br>
<i>&gt; which we budget 10 KW to run the Mr Fusion, and 10 KW to run the accelerator,</i><br>
<i>&gt; with 80 KW of waste heat!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I realize I'm doing major hand-waving here, but so are you. I haven't a<br>
clue as to the amount of waste generated per KW of fusion energy, or of<br>
how much of the waste will need accelerator treatment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The problem is that for esthetic and political reasons we want this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tiny accelerator to be contained within the "mister fusion" housing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What I'm banking on here is a major deux ex machina, even worse than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the inertial confinement system above: There are ways to use lasers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to pump energy into a particle beam with extreme efficiency, yielding</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a very high change in Mev per meter of acelerator.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Catch is the efficiency of making dose laser beams.</i><br>
<p>
Even worse is the efficieny of the waste recapture system, which will<br>
require continuous rebuilding of the entire structure by our busy little<br>
nanites. <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I further assume that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; an accelerator built via nanotech to atomic precision can achieve the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nearly the theoretical efficiency limit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Gotcha on this one! The nucleus is 10^5 times smaller than the atom. No</i><br>
<i>&gt; way can you create this precision with nanotech.</i><br>
<p>
Accelerators work today. Macro-scale machinery is capable of bashing<br>
atoms.<br>
What I'm going for here is the ability to increase the efficieny of<br>
macro-scale machinery by taking advantage of nanotech's atomic-scale<br>
precision. There is no requirement for nuclear-scale precision. If<br>
I could get nuclear-scale precision, I'd simply build a perfect<br>
proton-proton fuser and dispense with the rest of this.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This should permit each nasty</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; heavy radioneucleotide atom to be bashed with extreme precision into</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; little pieces that are more tractable, all (I hope) in an accelerator</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that's less than a meter long.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And you expect all those random flying bashed pieces to be nice? hah!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
No, I expect a large amount of messy garbage which will have to be<br>
recycled thru the fast-nuetron deactivatin section, but the net<br>
effect will be a reduction in heavy radioisotopes on each pass,<br>
bringing the remaining load to effectively zero.<br>
