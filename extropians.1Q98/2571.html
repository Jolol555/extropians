The recent discussion of IT workers and their economic value has led me once<br>
again to wonder about extropian and libertarian views of "labor unions" in<br>
general.  Principles of individual autonomy, economic liberty and spontaneous<br>
order should, it seems lead to the conclusion that workers should be free to<br>
form associations designed to leverage their economic value.  At the most<br>
general level of abstraction, there is no good reason workers with a common<br>
skill shouldn't be able to band together to increase their bargaining power.<br>
On the other hand, I have a hard time seeing how collective labor bargaining<br>
arrangements could survive in a competitive environment absent some state-<br>
sanctioned legal monopoly power or the use of violence to block breaches by<br>
labor-purchasers or defections of labor sellers, both antithetical to<br>
libertarian and extropian principles.<br>
<p>
One idea I have had is that "libertarian labor unions" could create value that<br>
would deter breaches and defections by becoming certification agencies.  A<br>
union of skilled workers could back their contracts with labor-buyers with<br>
certifications of skill of their member-workers.  Labor buyers might well<br>
prefer exclusive arrangements with such unions because it would externalize<br>
the cost of training and certification and such certification would add value<br>
to their own products and contracts.  Of course, there would likely be<br>
competition in many areas between multiple certification unions, but that<br>
would be completely in keeping with libertarian and extropian ideals.<br>
<p>
I'm curious what others here have thought about these ideas.<br>
