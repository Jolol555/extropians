<i>&gt;I mean, people who are shocked by a bit of cosmetic surgery, these people</i><br>

I just love the way you take time to carefully read our postings and <br>
then tell us we are wasting our time!  If you disagree and yet read, <br>
others may do the same and some brain cells might get stretched a <br>
bit!<br>

Natasha:<br>
<i>&gt;Hormones as part of chromosomes XX, XY, XYY?</i><br>

If doctors respond to the Duke University study on intersexual<br>
children and turn the decision as to whether to apply any sort of<br>
treatment over the intersexual individuals, we will have more<br>
members of the human population not in conformity with male/female<br>
classifications.  (Not to mention currently existing androgynes)  I<br>
figure that it would be more precise for medical purposes for each<br>
human to carry a profile based on internal factors, such as<br>
XX/(n)E/(n)T (with E= estrogen and T= testosterone).  For social <br>
purposes, each individual could decide for themselves what gender <br>
they wish to be known under, if any at all.<br>
