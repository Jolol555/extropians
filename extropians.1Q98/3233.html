My credit cards and drivers license do not yet have the ability to issue<br>
cards beyond the year 2000.  Both keep giving me cards that expire<br>
12/31/99.  I used to get some cards that lasted 5 years.  If they don't get<br>
the systems fixed by the year 2000, they won't be able to use the computers<br>
to issue new cards.<br>
<p>
Have you ever been in a bank when the computer was down?  I have.  They<br>
absolutely refused to give me my money.  Legal threats were of no use.<br>
They really have no mechanism to issue cash or record transactions without<br>
the computer.  Even if they did have a method, they would probably be too<br>
scared to use it.  If their computer goes down on January 2, 2000, I doubt<br>
they could handle it.  Even if they had paper transactions, it would be<br>
much slower and there would be more mistakes.<br>
<p>
Businesses that are not ready will fail.  Not because alternatives aren't<br>
available, but because customers will simply switch to other businesses<br>
that are functional.  Would any customer go to a gas station that can't<br>
accept your pay-at-the-pump card, when the one across the street can?<br>
Would any customer go to a grocery store where they can't use their debit<br>
card, when the store down the street can?  The first trip to a business<br>
where the customer is sent away empty-handed because the business can't<br>
handle the transaction, would be enough to turn off most customers.  I<br>
think this perception of poor business practices will kill most businesses<br>
that are not ready.<br>
