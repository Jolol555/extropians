Hi!<br>
<p>
Perhaps most of you already know this, but if you don't, I think it's<br>
interesting. <br>
<p>
I couple of weeks ago, I believe it was Damien Broderick who claimed an<br>
experiment where mice without telomerase were produced and appeared to<br>
be fine by their fourth generation.<br>
<p>
I took a look around to confirm this. I contacted Dr. Lee M. Silver at<br>
Princeton, I contacted both scientists who immortalized cells with<br>
telomerase, etc. The most important things I learned were: (1) By the<br>
6th generation, the mice are infertile. (2) The mice's telomers do<br>
shorten and almost disappear by the 5th generation. (3) The researchers<br>
instigated cancer cells from the mice cells without telomerase and these<br>
cancer cells -- who also don't have telomerase -- appear to be immortal<br>
(more than 360 divisions). (4) Somatic cells on the 6th generation show<br>
chromossome imbalance and other genetic errors, they also don't<br>
proliferate normally. If you want to learn more about it, check out:<br>

See ya,<br>
