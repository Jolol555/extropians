<i>&gt; I've heard numerous stories along this line.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; There is one essential fact:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; **ALL** US patents are a matter of public record unless **THE US </i><br>
<i>&gt; GOVERNMENT** has stepped in and classified them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you hear a story about an oil company suppressing a patent for a </i><br>
<i>&gt; highly efficient engine, there are three possibilities:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; (1) the story is true, the patent is on file and publically </i><br>
<i>&gt; accessible, and someone should produce the patent number so that </i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone can confirm the story -- failure to do so is careless </i><br>
<i>&gt; rumor-mongering.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (2) the story is true and THE US GOVERNMENT -- not an oil company -- </i><br>
<i>&gt; is suppressing it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (3) the story is false, at least to the extent that no such device </i><br>
<i>&gt; was patented.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Considering that the first such story I heard was from my father and </i><br>
<i>&gt; alleged that the high-performance high-mileage engine was developed </i><br>
<i>&gt; in the early 1960s, I am quite certain that at least some of these </i><br>
<i>&gt; patents (if they ever existed) have expired by now.  They would still </i><br>
<i>&gt; be on file and it would now be legal for anyone to start producing </i><br>
<i>&gt; them without any licensing requirements or royalties.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There's another twist to that.  It was a standing joke in the Soviet </i><br>
<i>&gt; Union that said country's greatest inventor was Comrade Reguspatoff.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you wonder at the joke, let me add a bit of punctuation to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; comrade's name:</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Reg.  U.S. Pat. Off.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If such super-engines, super-carburetors, etc.  were on file with the </i><br>
<i>&gt; US patent office, we *would* see them in Soviet-made military </i><br>
<i>&gt; vehicles.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; We don't.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless you assume that the global news media are also in on this </i><br>
<i>&gt; conspiracy to keep these things from us.</i><br>
<p>
      This is an excellent concise summary.  But there are a few puzzles.<br>
<p>
      <br>
      Here are a few, chosen (almost) at random.<br>
      <br>
      [1] French-Rumanian aeronautic engineer Henri Coanda (of 'Coanda <br>
      Bubble' fame!) was the world's leading aerofoil section designer -- <br>
      his was the first library of aerofoil sections.  In [1932] he <br>
      invented 'Lenticular Aerodynes' capable of VTOL _and_ fast <br>
      translational flight.  Idea is, we direct blown airflows over the <br>
      craft's surface (just like blown flaps) and it rises vertically into <br>
      the air.  Vectored thrust gives you gentle translation into level <br>
      flight.  The aerodynamics are magnificent (especially for air <br>
      combat dogfights and RPVs).<br>
<p>
      Coanda didn't have lightweight superefficent turbo-compressors.  We <br>
      surely do, now.<br>
      <br>
      I phoned them up, and discussed this project extensively with <br>
      Lockheed's Advanced Projects Division at Palmdale three or four <br>
      years back.  The name 'Richard M. Bissell' opens many doors...  They <br>
      built the U-2s and SR-71s together.<br>
<p>
      Coanda's idea works...  Would you believe us if we landed one right <br>
      on the White House lawn?  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
      Oddly enough, Lockheed Palmdale later sent _me_ a non-disclosure <br>
      agreement... &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
            <br>
      [2] BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene, generic, E321) is a potent zapper <br>
      of lipid-coated viruses as well as free radicals (Ref: Pearson &amp; <br>
      Shaw, 'L:ife Extension').  No side effects, five bucks a kilo. Much <br>
      better than megadoses of Vit. C; and your threshhold of infection is <br>
      raised by orders of magnitude.  Existing viral infections are <br>
      suppressed.  Just go look at the list of lipid-coated viruses <br>
      sometime...  No more 'flu either, Max!<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
      [3] Internal Evaporative Cooling by water-injection. <br>
      Internal-combustion engines run much more economically, cooler and <br>
      cleaner, if you inject water into the explosion cycle.  The big WWI <br>
      Wright Cyclone radials (I've flown with these!) showed 50% fuel <br>
      economies.<br>
      <br>
      Water is vastly cheaper than petrol...  OK, you need two tanks, and <br>
      you have to fill up at two pumps.  The technology can usually be <br>
      retrofitted.  Scrap the (absurd) external cooling system.<br>
      <br>
<p>
      [4] If we direst .2MeV protons into Lithium-7 nuclei, we get this:<br>
      <br>
      .2 MeV proton --&gt; Li-7 --&gt; Be-8 --&gt; 2 Alpha particles at 17 MeV.<br>
<p>
      This is a _fusion interaction_ which takes place at Standard <br>
      Temperature and Pressure, and which shows a huge energy surplus.<br>
      Cockroft and Walton got a Nobel Prize for discovering it in [1932].<br>
<p>
      In principle, a fusion reactor would comprise a proton accelerator <br>
      and a lithium target and a heat recovery system.  All 'non-hit' <br>
      energy losses are in principle recovrable (ref: energy conservation <br>
      laws).  For every fusion 'hit' you get a 17MeV payout.<br>
<p>
      Oh well, who is John Galt?<br>
