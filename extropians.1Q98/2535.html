The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches me that one day I may need some unknown person's<br>
help. Besides with the technology and power which will soon be available to the average postal<br>
worker ;-) wouldn't we all stand a better chance of living if 100% of the world was looking out<br>
for our survival vs some lesser amount?.    I wonder if a study (game theory) was done to see<br>
which attitude was more benefical to survival?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If the people there want my help, they should a) ask for it,</i><br>
<p>
Sometimes they are unable or not allowed or just ignorant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; b) have something to offer in return for my help,</i><br>
<p>
You would get at least that person's undying love, admiration, and respect (and mine too).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Instead, these people refuse our help until things are royally screwed up, and then beg for</i><br>
<i>&gt; our help. When we come in and perform political/economic triage to fix things, they start</i><br>
<i>&gt; protesting, bombing, and demanding we leave. Seems too many people don't like the saying</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Be careful what you ask for, you might get it".</i><br>
<p>
I agree. People who are screwed  up, usually don't change their behavior.<br>
