Although your logic is very sound, you are IMHO missing the other side of the<br>
equation.  Yes, everything I do in the long run effects everything else.  I<br>
know for a fact that my actions and anyone reading these words will be effected<br>
by it - even if it is just taking the time to delete this posting.  Since we<br>
have a global constinuency on this list, my actions in turn affect people all<br>
over the globe.  Within a few years, probably all 6 billion people, except the<br>
most isolated are in some way effected by me.  The same goes for everyone else.<br>
<p>
Therefore,  even my so called "good" actions could *indirectly* get someone<br>
killed.  I could for example decide to spend a little extra time at home<br>
kissing my wife.  Had I not chosen to do this, I would have driven down main<br>
street 3 minutes earlier, where I would have forced an otherwise speeding<br>
driver to slow down, because I was in front of him.  Instead, I wasn't there,<br>
so he was able to speed through the red light where he killed two pedestrians.<br>
<p>
My point:  If you try to contemplate the full ramifiactions of your actions you<br>
will wind up in a rubber room and miserable.<br>
<p>
My advice:  Do anything you want - have fun -lighten up and realize you have as<br>
much right as anyone else to be on this planet and have fun.  Not only is it<br>
easier, but in the biger scheme of things you will bring more joy and happiness<br>
to yourself and the people around you, than you other alternative.<br>
<p>
Best Regards,<br>
