Selective my foot.  I made it as extensive as my knowledge and time<br>
restricted me to.  I included all the countries which i was sure were<br>
spanish colonies, and i included all the countries you mentioned.  And in<br>
any case your separation between early and late colonisation<br>
is bogus since Australia, New Zealand, India, Ceylon and South Africa were<br>
all colonised at approximately the same time, you are just dividing them<br>
into countries that did well and countries that didn't.  In any case, my<br>
main point was in showing that your statement, and i quote, "If you looked <br>
at a list of countries today that were once British colonies, and compared<br>
them to the former colonies of other former great powers, you would find<br>
that the former British colonies are today much more stable, and developed<br>
economically, politically, and culturally, by and large."  Especially,<br>
this last bit "by and large", since only 4 colonies have done well, and<br>
the rest have done extremely poorly, by contrast to the extensive list of<br>
ex-spanish colonies, of which i don't think any of them had a lower<br>
gdp/capita, literacy rate or lifespan than india, which by your reckoning<br>
was one of the bright stars of the third world in industry,... (can't be<br>
bothered to find the quote).  <br>
chau<br>
PS:  BTW, of the spanish countries, i would say that only a couple of<br>
countries wiped out their native population, in most of them, they are<br>
still a majority (in the diluted mestizo form).<br>
