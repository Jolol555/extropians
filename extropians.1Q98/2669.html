<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; The British tended to respect cutural diversity, except in matters such as cannibalism</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; British merely overlaid systems of parliamentary government, judicial systems, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; undertook to educate the best and brightest of the natives. If you looked at a list of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; countries today that were once British colonies, and compared them to the former colonies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; of other former great powers, you would find that the former British colonies are today</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; much more stable, and developed economically, politically, and culturally, by and large.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Just curious:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Given that, as you say above, the British colonised north america and australia in the "early</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; period", which countries did it colonise later?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; India, Ceylon, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Rhodesia, Belize (then British Honduras), Pakistan,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bangladesh, Burma.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; India and SA are notably the nations still in the best shape, and which took to being colonized</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather well. While SA had the Dutch blight of apartheid to deal with, it is coming out of it</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather nicely (note that that did not exist until SA was indpendent), India on the other hand is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the shining light of the third world for stability and industry, as well as cultural diversity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
If you consider India to be in good shape, then you can probably say that<br>
most 3rd world countries are.  The fact that they've got a large industry<br>
is just a product of their massive population, but if you consider GDP per<br>
capita, poverty levels, literacy levels and life expectancy, i think you <br>
would find that, just like the rest of the latter Brittish colonies, they<br>
do just as badly, if not worse, than the French or spanish colonies.<br>
