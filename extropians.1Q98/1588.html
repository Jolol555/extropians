This seems like something in Foresight's line:<br>

Is there an "Encyclopedia of Misinformation" in print, or a "False Fun<br>
Facts" data-base on the World Wide Web, or something like that?<br>
<p>
I know about the Urban Folklore sites, but I'm looking for something broader.<br>
<p>
Here's a sample application: I just read that the mathematician-philosopher<br>
Leibniz once claimed (wrongly!) that when one rolls two dice, one is as<br>
likely to roll an 11 as a 12, because in each case there's "only one way"<br>
(11=5+6, 12=6+6).<br>
<p>
Now how can I tell whether Leibniz really said this, or whether it's a false<br>
story that (say) 80% of historians of science believe because _they_ read<br>
about it in books whose authors read about it in other books?  After all,<br>
it's such a Fun Fact that it's the kind of thing that would be repeated,<br>
whether it was true or not.<br>
<p>
An arduous way to show that something like this is false is to go through<br>
the complete works of Leibniz and fail to find the quotation.  (There are<br>
shortcuts, like indexes and concordances, but let's leave that aside.)<br>
<p>
A *quick* way to convince oneself that such a rumor is LIKELY to be false<br>
is to find some expert who says "This is a famous legend with no basis in<br>
fact, and the 80% of experts who think otherwise are using second-hand and<br>
third-hand bad information."  But in such a case you'd have to ask three<br>
experts before you'd stand a roughly even chance of finding an expert who<br>
was in-the-know.<br>
<p>
Also, what if it turns out that the most informed 1% know that the bottom<br>
80% are right after all, and that "Lincoln really _did_ write that speech<br>
on the back of an envelope..."?  You really want to get your information<br>
from a public resource of some kind that is subjected to scrutiny by a<br>
wide variety of people.  Any particular edition of the "Encyclopedia of<br>
Misinformation" would contain some errors, but one would hope that each<br>
error would be corrected in the very next edition (or that the editors<br>
would at least indicate that there was genuine controversy among the<br>
seemingly equally well-informed about some particular issue).  A readily<br>
modifiable data-base would be even better than a book, since mistakes<br>
could be rectified very quickly.<br>
<p>
I own a book called "The Experts Speak: the definitive compendium of<br>
authoritative misinformation", but it's not quite what I'm looking for.<br>
