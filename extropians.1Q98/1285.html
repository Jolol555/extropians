<i>&gt; in a cover-up.  THAT is what brought Nixon down.</i><br>
<p>
      That really is _preposterous_.<br>
      <br>
      Nixon's presidencies were marked by a gross contempt for law and <br>
      ethics as well as every principle of a Constitutional Republic.  <br>
      Never mind every decent principle of the Republican Party.<br>
      <br>
      "When the President does it, that means it isn't illegal.'  DUH...<br>
<p>
<p>
      The most probable explanation of 'Watergate' is the one detailed <br>
      (and albeit denied by DCI Richard Helms -- whose autobiography is <br>
      imminent BTW) in John Ranelagh's magnificent history of CIA, 'The <br>
      Agency' [1988].  The Watergate complex was built on the site of <br>
      CIA's old Headquarters Building...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
      Briefly:  Howard Hunt, long-time senior CIA Covert Operations <br>
      practitioner (and novelist), set out to entrap Nixon, whose <br>
      Sauron-like attempts to concentrate the power of every branch and <br>
      Department and Agency of the Federal Government under the control of <br>
      servile Nixonite White House nominees was _completely intolerable_ <br>
      to anyone concerned to ensure the survival of a free Republic.  Only <br>
      CIA and NSA held out.  Hunt used to joke that -- in 20 years in CIA <br>
      -- there were only two kinds of people he'd never met: assassins; <br>
      and fellow-Republicans.  &gt;:-}  CIA are world masters of bureaucratic <br>
      infighting -- it's our^H^H^H their _forte_.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Nixon was a political soul-mate of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (the <br>
      most evil man in the history of America).  Like Hoover, he avidly <br>
      collected seamy 'political intelligence' blackmail material on his <br>
      'enemies' (i.e. anyone who opposed his agenda).  So when a <br>
      'black-bag job' on the Democratic Party National Headquarters itself <br>
      was dangled in front of him, he found the temptation _irresistible_. <br>
      Using anti-Castro Cubans with a CIA background seemed smart, because <br>
      they could be trusted (or so it seemed); and because they looked <br>
      'deniable.'  And - best of all! -- CIA (which Nixon and Hoover hated <br>
      as 'liberal' and free-thinking) could be blamed if things  went <br>
      wrong!  "Let's pull a fast one on Joey!"  &gt;:-}<br>
      <br>
<p>
      Hunt's plan duly scheduled (quite ambiguously) the 'accidental <br>
      discovery' and subsequent arrest of the 'Watergate' burglars _in <br>
      flagrante delicto_.  Anyone who believes that ordinary beat <br>
      policemen will usually arrest and charge active-service CIA <br>
      operatives within America itself _is_ living in a dream-world, and <br>
      will believe anything... &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
      Remember, _Hunt knew_ that _Nixon knew_ that he (Nixon) was guilty <br>
      _right from the start_.  So -- once events were set in motion -- <br>
      there was no way that Nixon could ever escape _actual_ complicity.  <br>
      He'd 'signed off' on the project, remember.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Nixon -- being wholly predictable -- could then be relied upon to <br>
      use every power of the Federal Government to attempt to get off the <br>
      hook.  All to no avail, because CIA _and_ NSA had the whole <br>
      operation _wired_, and could neatly 'blow' any Nixonite maoeuvre <br>
      with perfect timing and precision.  Any slowing of the action, and <br>
      tit-bits of information culd go to Woodward and Bernstein to keep <br>
      the pot boiling.<br>
      <br>
      So -- like a giant buzz-saw -- the 'Watergate' game inexorably cut a <br>
      chasm right through the edifice of power which Nixon had created, <br>
      exposing all the horrors of his political abuses of power.<br>
<p>
      <br>
      As in a good Greek tragedy (Howard Hunt was very literate -- CIA <br>
      employs more Doctorates and post-grads than any other Agency) Nixon <br>
      and his gang were doomed from the outset.  There was no way out. <br>
      Even when Nixon fired half of the entire CIA Covert Action <br>
      Directorate -- 400 people -- in vicious retaliation, this only <br>
      worsened matters, as they could then all say and do whatever they <br>
      damn well liked, all over 'official' Washington.<br>
<p>
<p>
      America owes a great deal to CIA and NSA -- more than the American <br>
      people will ever know.<br>
