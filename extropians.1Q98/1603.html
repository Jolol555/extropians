Ok, I'm still going ...<br>
<p>
And, of course Dr. Sharon Presley who runs Resources for Independent<br>
Thinking, and Dr. Aileen Foreman who bestows keen insight,  or Gail Henson<br>
who founded an extropian dinner group in Orange County, Pam Feeley whose<br>
agency finds jobs for temps, Kara Heward who is the charming sis of Abe,<br>
attachtive Aniko, Mary Margret who is a energy-packed cryonicist, Gayle<br>
Pergamit who co-authored _Unbounding The Future_, not to mention the women<br>
at Bio-Preservation, Inc....<br>

Thanks. Excuse me for not mentioning at least 50 other women who are members<br>
of ExI, whose privacy I'll respect (and who do not post on the list).<br>

Excellent suggestion Hara Ra, but in deference to all, I'll be discrete on<br>
this point. But for someone else who has the motivation, I think this is a<br>
darn-good idea.<br>
