Can you please state what your criteria for sentience are? In other words,<br>
how do you determine this state? (Can you prove that _I_ am sentient? Let<br>
me argue for the sake of playing devil's advocate that I'm actually a<br>
monstrously powerful Chinese Room a la Searle. C'mon, now. What do you say<br>
to that?)<br>
<p>
And why is sentience your criterion for eating or not eating something?<br>

Thanks. You've just come up with an argument for eating or euthanising<br>
people in persistent vegetative states.<br>
<p>
Please explain why eating mentally defective humans is bad but eating<br>
cows is good. Or state _why_ the forgoing question strikes you as being<br>
a red herring.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; You're assuming a rights-based transaction between humans and their prey.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Essentially, but as a contest of rights. A prey that flees is contesting my right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; eat it. If I catch it, I've proven my fitness/right to do so. Classic natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; selection. A cow that contests nothing implies no contestation of right.</i><br>
<p>
That's not a rights-based system as I understand it. Rights as a concept<br>
are derived from this odd eighteenth-century rationalist theory about<br>
social contracts, which in turn were derived as an answer to the<br>
question of how to run a society without a king (or other<br>
divinely-mandated source of authority). The idea is that there exists an<br>
implicit contract between the citizen and their peers -- all of them are<br>
to observe the terms of the contract, under threat of sanction, but they<br>
benefit from it as well because the terms include things like "thou shalt<br>
not rape, murder, and eat thy neighbours", so being part of a community<br>
that observes such a contract means you're reasonably safe from being<br>
raped, murdered, and eaten by your neighbour. <br>
<p>
What you're suggesting is simply a contest of strength. Say you're the<br>
hunter and I am the cow; there's no opportunity for me to say "this is an<br>
invalid contract!". <br>
<p>
It's not even classic natural selection -- go read Darwin's Dangerous Idea<br>
by Daniel Dennett, or The Extended Phenotype by Richard Dawkins, then get<br>
back to me.<br>
<p>
(Clue: I live with a vegan. _I_ eat meat regularly. I'm not arguing with<br>
you because you've tweaked my fanaticism bone, I'm arguing with you because<br>
I think your arguments against vegetarianism don't survive scrutiny.)<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; If the human race becomes all herbivores, what species will then claim the job</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; of top carnivore???</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The species that have already got it. Remember, we're all food for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; prokaryotes in the end. (At least until we manage to develop uploading.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And even then, we might find there's something that eats human minds ...)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; parasites? I'm thinking of predators that work for their meals. </i><br>
<p>
Bacteria don't work for their meals?<br>
<p>
Sorry, what you seem to mean is something furry and warm blooded with teeth<br>
and fangs that can run faster than you can. This is _not_ an efficient<br>
predator. (Compare the carrying capacity of a chunk of land in lions per<br>
hectare with it's carrying capacity of deer per hectare and you might <br>
eventually figure out why lions are rare.) In fact, anything high up the<br>
food chain is at risk -- over-specialised, needs to eat only a comparatively<br>
rare food-stuff, vulnerable to population crashes among its prey.<br>
<p>
Perhaps as things<br>
<i>&gt; accelerate, we might develop human variants or other predators that will cull out</i><br>
<i>&gt; the weak. You'll notice how penal psychology refers to many criminals as</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'predators'. If they are the predators, does this mean that psychology has already</i><br>
<i>&gt; abdicated our role for us and thinks of  well adjusted people as  'sheep'???</i><br>
<p>
This whole paragraph is phrased on the basis of the assumption that<br>
human phenotypic behaviour is inherited. Human phenotypic behaviour is<br>
NOT inherited, it's largely ACQUIRED. (What do you think a meme is?) Our<br>
extended phenotype -- the expression of our genes -- is a virtual<br>
machine for running memes on. As such, we're really the first species on<br>
our planet to achieve the breakthrough to a Lamarckian evolutionary<br>
perspective, hence the astounding rate of change over the past five<br>
hundred centuries. This isn't my crank theory; it belongs to Richard<br>
Dawkins, but I happen to think it more or less fits the facts.<br>
<p>
Basing your arguments for the next century, and for how life will look<br>
in an uploaded universe, on a Victorial view of events of a million<br>
years ago is Not Rational.<br>
