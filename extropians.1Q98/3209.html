Mark Crosby pointed us to a debate between Steven Pinker and Steven Rose,<br>
published at the Edge website, for which I am very grateful.  (I've previously<br>
endorsed the Edge - www.edge.org - as perhaps the highest quality discussion<br>
forum on the net, but hadn't been there since the Pinker/Rose debate had been<br>
put up on their site.)  Whether you read Pinker's book or not, reviewing the<br>
debate documented at the Edge is fascinating reading.<br>

<i>&gt;  the spectrum by many other researchers in their</i><br>
<i>&gt;  respective fields.</i><br>
<p>
As it happens, although I haven't read Rose's most recent book "Lifelines", I<br>
have read his book "The Making of Memory".  Ironically, in light of some of<br>
the criticisms of Pinker's book others have made, I wouldn't have endorsed<br>
Rose's book here because I didn't find all that much in "The Making of Memory"<br>
that added to a deep understanding of cognitive science (technically, it was<br>
too finely focused on the neurochemistry of memory formation to be of wide<br>
general interest, or so I would have thought) and the writing was a bit too<br>
personalistic in a way I didn't find particularly appealing (perhaps lacking<br>
the humor of the many brief detours one finds in Pinker's book).<br>
<p>
With regard specifically to the Pinker/Rose debate, as a professional<br>
rhetorician I found Rose's part of the discussion very patently an attack on a<br>
straw man, which Pinker correctly pointed out.  Rose and other "computational<br>
evolutionary psychologists" (to coin a term) are not nearly the simple<br>
reductionists that Pinker makes out. Pinker clearly states many times in his<br>
book and in the debate that some important aspects of cognition cannot be<br>
understood fully or really with any depth at all without an analysis of<br>
higher-order cognitive constructs (e.g.. beliefs and desires), that such<br>
constructs are very REAL and, if I understand the overarching theory he and<br>
many others espouse, that the richness of human mental life is PRIMARILY a<br>
function of the immensely complex action of such high-order mental phenomena.<br>
In this regard, I think that one could only characterize Pinker and his<br>
colleagues as lying "at the extreme end of the spectrum" by ignoring this<br>
important point.<br>
