I've been a good girl about staying out of these kinds of <br>
discussions, and a lot of my extropian friends happen to be male, but <br>
I swore that once I had heard the above question for more than 29 <br>
times (guess what, this is the 30th), I would say three things:<br>
<p>
1.  Most women are drawn to Extropian and Transhumanist ideas for the <br>
exact same reason the men are, and we would all make a lot more <br>
progress on shared ideas by assuming that everyone is here as <br>
intellectual explorers.<br>
<p>
2.  I was the first woman to post to the Transhumanist list run by <br>
Alex Bokov, and no fewer than fifteen men told me, in no uncertain <br>
terms, that they didn't want girls in their sandbox.  Two of them <br>
petitioned Alex to remove me from the list, and this caused the mother <br>
of all internet fights, for about two weeks.  Alex, Rich, Anders, and <br>
many other men went to bat for me because I couldn't fight it alone.  <br>
The thread remains in the archives as a badge of shame for all <br>
transhumanists.<br>
<p>
3.  I have, over the past two years, received many notes from women <br>
who have lurked on the two lists for awhile, and then left.  Their <br>
reasons varied, but most stated that they saw strong expressions of <br>
mysogyny on the lists.  Some of them were receiving very rude come-ons <br>
from guys on the list, some were treated like they didn't have a <br>
brain in their head.  I think that if guys are going to <br>
complain about the lack of women on the lists, you should take a minute <br>
to think about what you are personally doing to make them feel welcome <br>
here.<br>
<p>
It's up to you!<br>
<p>
