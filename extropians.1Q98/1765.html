We're discussing bootstrapping routes to machine-phase, right?  If yes,<br>
then it is difficult to see how such relatively flabby systems can be of<br>
any assistance. An engineered enzyme to generate (cagey) pieces of a<br>
macromolecular complex, yes. Heavily crosslinked, stiff protein capable of<br>
surviving at UHV conditions, yes. <br>
<p>
The only other possibility for this I can see is crude scaffolding. What<br>
is it really meant for? Can you describe the outline of your pathway?<br>

These arms will be _very_ flabby.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; push the proteins into appropriate places. </i><br>
<p>
But what is all this meant for?<br>
