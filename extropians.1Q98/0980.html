Charlie, I think you need to clarify your argument. You seem to be<br>
saying that diabetics can't get cheap health insurance, whereas a<br>
government funded system would cover them. Yet you then say that thanks<br>
to the NHS there's no free health insurance market, and that untreated<br>
diabetes is a major cause of road accidents, implying that the NHS is<br>
doing a lousy job of treating them.<br>
<p>
Healthcare is probably the most heavily controlled industry on the<br>
planet, and attempting to use it as a demonstration of free-market<br>
failure seems absurd to say the least (particularly when the NHS does it<br>
so badly, and severely restricts treatment for the elderly folks who<br>
need it the most).<br>
