Maybe I'm just dense, but I honestly don't see the difference between<br>
the two statements:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"diabetic hypoglycaemia is a..."</i><br>
<p>
"Untreated diabetes..."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"...not-too-uncommon cause of auto accidents"</i><br>

"...causes lots of road accidents"<br>

I'm not trying to put words into your mouth, just rephrasing what you<br>
said. What precisely is the difference here?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You seem to be locked into a fairly narrow way of understanding </i><br>

On the contrary, I often help out friends who need money. But I strongly<br>
resent the government stealing half my income to give to their bureaucrats<br>
and people I don't know and will probably never meet, and that kind of<br>
conflict will always exist when people take money by force.<br>

<i>&gt;I dunno. The free market _may_ be the optimal mediational method, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;all I know;  but what I see here isn't people trying to _prove_ it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or, alternatively, trying to invent something better: what I see </i><br>
<i>&gt;is people taking it as a forgone conclusion.</i><br>
<p>
This whole century has been a series of grand experiments in finding<br>
better ways to organise a society than a free market, and they've all <br>
proven far worse. Noone has ever done any better, but as I've said<br>
many times before, the great advantage of a free society is that those<br>
who wish to try alternate ways of living can go off and set up their<br>
own voluntary communities to test them out. If one of them turns out<br>
to be better than a free market then you can be sure that most people<br>
will soon join them.<br>
