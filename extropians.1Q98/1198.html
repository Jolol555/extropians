Yes, there is plenty of land, but that is not the point. The point is<br>
that you grow the plants right in the middle of the city, next to the<br>
consumers. Very low transport costs, and you can get extremely fresh<br>
vegetables directly (with no soil to wash away!). Besides, if you keep<br>
the hydroponics sealed, you can avoid many pests and have no need for<br>
pesticides.<br>
<p>
This will not likely replace all crops, but some vegetables can most<br>
likely be profitably grown in this way. There is already a mall<br>
somewhere in the US (saw it on Discovery Channel) were this is done,<br>
apparently earning real money.<br>

<p>
It seems that you think of agriscrapers as something similar to normal<br>
agriculture. But if you look at real hydroponics, it is a quiet affair<br>
with plants tending themselves in plastic nutrient vats and electrical<br>
elevators to bring down the vats for harvest. No need for huge<br>
machinery (or rather, it is part of the building).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Oh...by the way...with an increase in CO2 content in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; air...farming becomes more effecient.</i><br>
<p>
Depends a lot on how the climate changes. I seem to recall an old<br>
study made of productivity of wheat and other crops as a function of<br>
temperature and moisture. Some areas of the US were very near the<br>
maximum for at least one crop (I think it was wheat), and any change<br>
would decrease productivity sharply. It is not easy to move farms to<br>
suit a changed climate (although it would be nice to see wineyeards in<br>
the hills of northern Sweden :-).<br>
