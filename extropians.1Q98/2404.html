How often do you use wholly one approach or the other?  One of the rules<br>
of thumb given in _The Mythical Man-Month_ (iirc) is: "Plan to throw one<br>
away."  If you're designing a big project, there will almost certainly<br>
come a time when you say to yourself, "If I had known when starting this<br>
what I have learned in the process, I'd have done it very differently"<br>

and it's wise to follow that instinct.

When I was working as a programmer (a long time ago in a galaxy far far
away) my coworker remarked one day that Beethoven's feat, composing his
greatest symphony while deaf, isn't all that remarkable - it's what we
did every day: arranged a sequence of instructions which, if we
understood
the compiler and hadn't blundered, would produce a desired effect.  
Neither we nor Beethoven could verify the effect of each symbol as we
wrote it; we had to rely on experience to predict what the effect
would be.  The only difference is that a deaf composer can't debug. ;)
