<i>&gt; mere passive observation. I'd rather aim for convincing it to follow</i><br>
<i>&gt; a rule which implied respecting our rights.</i><br>
<p>
You're right.  Still, I wonder if the very things that make it seem<br>
questionable to extend a rights framework to register claims of nonhuman<br>
pain will render human claims to rights similarly trivial to a Power.  My<br>
argument to the Power shoots for the double whammy of the appeal to hope<br>
(unforseeable promise of pleasure) and the appeal to fear (safeguard<br>
against unforseeable danger).  I'm afraid that an abstract appeal to<br>
shared "rights" might start to cash out as inconsequential to real conduct<br>
when power/knowledge-assymmetries start getting too large.  Doesn't this<br>
happen already? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Also, a Power will probably know enough that the example you set by </i><br>
<i>&gt; your vegetarianism is very unlikely to convince it to change its moral</i><br>
<i>&gt; system.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I hope to spread the vegetarian meme as part of spreading the more<br>
general and more important "respect diversity" meme, such that a widely<br>
disseminated respect for beings will already infect the Power before she<br>
or he (it, they, we) *becomes* a Power in the first place.  <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I see my vegetarianism as a dress rehearsal for Power ethics to come. </i><br>
<p>
By which I mean to say, as much as anything else, that with all of this I<br>
am also always arguing already with the Power I am liable to become<br>
*myself* one day.<br>
<p>
Very best, Dale<br>
