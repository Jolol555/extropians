  IAN: Yes, the power of the Borgian-memetic field rules<br>
  the minds of the masses! An ideal example of the power<br>
  of "Borgian memetics" revolves around the TWA 800 mis-<br>
  sile theory, which is crazy exclusively because the Borg<br>
  says so. The Borgian memetic generator is the GovtMedia. <br>
<p>
  How can physics, all physical evidence, and dozens of <br>
  witness accounts compete with the Borg? They cannot! <br>
  The Borg rules the minds of the masses, even the major-<br>
  ity of those who fancy themselves one-up on the Borg.<br>
<p>
  I can't think of a better example of the raw power of<br>
  Borgian memetics than TWA 800, the power to make truth<br>
  fantasy and fantasy truth by the mere word of the Borg.<br>
  Even libertarians soak up the CIA's  pseudoscientific <br>
  and utterly debunked TWA 800 video, it simply boggles <br>
  the mind! What are laws of aerodynamics (which render<br>
  the CIA video a fraud) next to the word of the Borg?<br>
  Laws of aerodynamics are nothing next to the Borg.<br>
  Nothing: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/zehr.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/zehr.htm</a> <br>
<p>
  What are the actual measurements of the flight data <br>
  recorder (FDR) (clearly  measuring the impact of an<br>
  externally sourced pressure-wave) next to the almighty<br>
  word of the Borg? FDR data is nothing next to the Borg.<br>
  Nothing: <a href="http://members.aol.com/bardonia/analysis.htm">http://members.aol.com/bardonia/analysis.htm</a> <br>
<p>
  What is the distribution of debris over 1 mile to the <br>
  right of the flight path (proving without question that <br>
  the crash event experienced massive inputs of external <br>
  kinetic-energy) next to the word of the Borg? Ballistic<br>
  geometry is nothing next to the sacred word of the Borg.<br>
  Nothing: <a href="http://members.aol.com/RobertD202/Debris.html">http://members.aol.com/RobertD202/Debris.html</a> <br>
<p>
  What is the radar track of a ship speeding away from <br>
  the scene (that radar-horizon mathematics prove must be<br>
  over 58 feet high, and which also travels at 30 knots <br>
  like a large Navy cruiser) in addition to other tracks <br>
  that behave like submarines, when compared to the word<br>
  of the Borg? These silly fact are nothing to the Borg.<br>
  Nothing: <a href="http://www.webexpert.net/rosedale/twacasefile/boat.html">http://www.webexpert.net/rosedale/twacasefile/boat.html</a> <br>
<p>
  What is a photograph which even the FBI admits is an<br>
  aircraft (which is obviously more like a missile drone<br>
  than any variety of aircraft, proving military activity<br>
  in the are) next to the Borg's word? It's just nothing.<br>
  Just nothing: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/kab-dcoy.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/kab-dcoy.htm</a> <br>
<p>
  How can over 100 witnesses who saw a streaking flame<br>
  rise up from the water, trailing white smoke, taking <br>
  down TWA 800 be right when the Borg says "no missile"?<br>
  No number of witnesses can be right if the Borg says <br>
  wrong: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm</a> <br>
<p>
  How dare physics, math, physical evidence, facts and <br>
  witnesses second-guess the Borg, how dare they!! The<br>
  Borg alone reigns supreme, all else is false. All who<br>
  say "not" are crazy! The crazy may have to be locked <br>
  up; ergo, those who question the Borg may have to be <br>
  locked up: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/decree.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/decree.htm</a> <br>
