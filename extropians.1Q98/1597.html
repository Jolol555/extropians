No, it just means that when they finally discover this thing you've<br>
been hiding from them for so long they become obsessed with it and you<br>
get another pervert on your hands.  Which may be okay, if they happen<br>
to have a rubber fetish, but if somewhere along the line they link<br>
violence and sexual behaviour (both treated in the same way during<br>
childhood - I'm suprised violent rape isn't the norm) society has a<br>
problem.<br>
<p>
Being "emotionally ready" is a myth made and enforced by society, if<br>
you have sex before society says you're emotinally ready the only<br>
emtional troumer your suffer will be caused by the very same society. <br>
