<i>&gt;&gt; : John Clark, one of the more intelligent free market advisors, would</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : answer: "If you remove governments, all this corruption will disappear</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : and the free market will bring up only efficient companies." The problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : is that by removing government, you only remove a cover under which the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : true power elite hides. The power structures remain - and before you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : say "Jebediah", your country will be ruled directly by big enterprises.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Evidence?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For the power structures, there's lots of evidence. US history is full of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Start with JFK, go over to Vietnam, look at Watergate, look at how Reagan was</i><br>
<i>&gt;put up as a strawman for Bush and how Bush (former CIA-boss, coming from a</i><br>
<i>&gt;rich family, good connections to investment banks, big in the oil industry</i><br>
<i>&gt;with Zapata Oil), how Bush started the Gulf War etc.</i><br>
<p>
You said that the power structures remain after the state is REMOVED.<br>
Was the Vietnam War run in the ABSENCE of a powerful government?<br>
Did Nixon turn to crime to protect his PRIVATE power-base?<br>
Did Bush start the Gulf War while he was OUT of office?<br>
<p>
That some privileged people are able to manipulate the state's power<br>
to their own ends, no one but a blindfolded idealist denies.  This proves<br>
NOTHING about what they would be able to do WITHOUT using the state.<br>
<p>
The claim that "Reagan was put up as a strawman for Bush" would be<br>
more plausible if Reagan's and Bush's economic policies were similar.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [...] People in the Middle Ages (another fine Free Market) [...]</i><br>
<p>
Idiot.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; : About military: Why do you think we have it? Because some bums in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : government think we need it to defend our country?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Because military forces have been around longer than anyone can remember,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and few dare question their necessity?  I dunno, you tell us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, I won't. Give me a rational explanation.</i><br>
<p>
The state, as a quasi-living self-perpetuating entity, repeats the<br>
behaviors that tend to increase its power, irrespective of whether<br>
such behaviors are good for the society that it nominally serves.<br>
One such behavior is war-making.  (As I said before.)<br>
