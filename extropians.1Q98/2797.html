<i>&gt; think it is well established that kids from single parent homes are more</i><br>

	I think this is a correlation/causation question.  I also come from a<br>
single parent home(although I'm not truly single-parented, does that make a<br>
difference?), and know many others, and all of us I would say are *less*<br>
likely to commit a crime.  Being the only man of the house(or woman)<br>
requires added responsibilities... such a situation can make one grow up<br>
fast (in the positive sense)    My guess is that single-parent homes are<br>
not the cause of a child's tendency towards criminal behaviour, but instead<br>
they are a side-effect of the real cause.  For example, I would like to<br>
know how many single parent homes there are in lower income families, or in<br>
lower income neighborhoods.  I would also be interested to know if the<br>
details of the child ending up with only one parent are significant...<br>
possibly a child with a parent that has died has a different tendency<br>
towards criminal behaviour than a child whose parents divorced?  Anyway, my<br>
point is: I think it is ridiculous to say that single-parent homes<br>
influence criminal behaviour without much more evidence than "there are<br>
lots of single-parent kids in jail." <br>
