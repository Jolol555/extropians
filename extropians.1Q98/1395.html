Today's discoveries:<br>
<p>
* Greg Stock's _Metaman_, (1993)<br>
* That I can smell an extropian within two paragraphs.  (Never mind<br>
recognizing the name.)<br>
* That I can't easily say what extropians are.<br>
<p>
My advisor lent me his copy, which Stock had given him at some<br>
conference at UCLA last month.  I mentioned having seen or heard of him<br>
on the extropians list.  My advisor asked me what 'extropians' was.  But<br>
I can't echo the Five Capitalized Principles, and my hash of<br>
extropianism as a rejuvenated Enlightenment feels fine as a hash, but<br>
pretentious as an explanation to someone who doesn't know about it.  So<br>
I fell back on "technophilic futurist libertarians".  Later I thought<br>
that "optimistic technophiles who know evolution, economics, and the<br>
fact that the two are nearly the same thing" might have been better.  I<br>
suppose self-transformation should be worked in, although I think I'd be<br>
more comfortable with 'adaptive'.<br>
