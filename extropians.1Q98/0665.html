Every person is the architect of their own future, be it good or bad.<br>

People who start poor and stay poor either 1) don't mind being poor, 2)<br>
make a lot of stupid choices that keep them poor, or 3) don't work hard<br>
enough to change their socio-economic status.  Period.  In the US,<br>
opportunities abound for a person to change their lot in life, and a person<br>
can take advantage of them at almost any time in their life.  Whose fault<br>
is it if they don't take advantage of these opportunities?  A clone would<br>
be in a situation no different than everyone else.<br>
<p>
One thing is for certain:  the government does very little to help people<br>
work harder or make intelligent decisions.  Therefore, it should be no<br>
surprise that the attempts of government to control poverty (by programs<br>
like Welfare) do little to change the socio-economic status of the<br>
individual involved.<br>
