That's why biogerontologists call them species that appear not to age.<br>
As far as I know, no-one has ever proved that lobsters age. If you know<br>
of anyone, please let me know.<br>
<p>
Also, species that appear not to age do grow indefinitely. I don't know<br>
if there is any species that grows indefinitely and does age, but I know<br>
that all species that appear not to age grow indefinitely. Hayflick<br>
