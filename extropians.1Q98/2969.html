"an x/y coordinate system" implies a *continuum*, not a dichotomy.<br>
Reducing the number of dimensions to two does not make it "dualism".<br>
<p>
I don't think anyone here disagrees with your point that the true number<br>
of political dimensions may be very large.  The territory represented by<br>
my map of San Francisco has at least three dimensions (what are the<br>
physicists saying these days, ten dimensions?), and yet two is still the<br>
most convenient number.<br>

<i>&gt; I live in Australia. We have one of the highest standards of</i><br>

<i>&gt; hard]  Nup.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I know a few Australians who live in California by choice.<br>
(Our government, of course, "protects" us from many others who would<br>
make that choice.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; While most other democratic governments utilize a parliamentary system of government,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; these have proven to be rather unstable and prone to rapid populist influence (bread and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; circuses),</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh. Okay. You are of course referring to something other than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Westminster System which as far as I know is quite a robust</i><br>
<i>&gt; parliamentary system.</i><br>
<p>
Robust because plurality elections produce a two-party system and thus<br>
usually give one party a majority which it would not have in a more<br>
representative system.  Thus the ruling party can weild sweeping power<br>
without provoking constitutional crises; I'm not convinced that's<br>
entirely a good thing. ;)<br>
<p>
(I advocate proportional representation with a separately-elected<br>
executive - and high standards for the use of power.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Two words: Ronald Reagan.</i><br>
<p>
Four words: Longest peacetime economic expansion.  I'm not a fan of his,<br>
but what's your point?  Maybe it's self-evident to you, but I don't read<br>
the same papers you read.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; the US uses a republican system with, as you must know, three equally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; powerful branches that are capable of checking the other. This system provides a measure</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of negative feedback that helps hold in check the most contagious of populist fads and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; foolishness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You are of course joking. The President of the United States has</i><br>
<i>&gt; as much power as the other two branches of government. This has</i><br>
<i>&gt; always struck me as dangerously absurd, but given that it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; created in the wake of a monarchy, understandable.</i><br>
<p>
Has Tony Blair less power?<br>
<p>
We are taught in elementary school that none of our three branches can<br>
do much of anything without at least tacit consent of the other two (the<br>
"checks and balances").  In practice, the "balances" have long since<br>
gone out of whack and the "checks" function more the other way, to put<br>
each branch in the pocket of the others - in particular, the judiciary<br>
is the creature of the very people against whom it is supposed to<br>
protect us.<br>
<p>
(If I were at Philadelphia in 1787, I'd have argued against creating a<br>
separate federal judiciary.)<br>
