<i>&gt; &gt; The introductory message to this list claims that Extropians may have an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; interest in "rational ethics (ethics for survival and flourishing)". This</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; must surprise a lot of list members, who seem to take a far more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; libertarian view of ethics. Many here seem to take the view that it's OK to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do what you like, so long as you don't harm anyone else. I challenge those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people to place a boundary around causing "harm to anyone else". Every</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; action a person takes will affect every other person to some small extent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You can't live your life without causing harm to someone else. All you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do is mitigate the degree of harm whilst promoting your objectives. I for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one have an interest in the "rational ethics" declared in the introduction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
[snip]<br>
<i>&gt; Therefore,  even my so called "good" actions could *indirectly* get someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; killed.  I could for example decide to spend a little extra time at home</i><br>
<i>&gt; kissing my wife.  Had I not chosen to do this, I would have driven down main</i><br>
<i>&gt; street 3 minutes earlier, where I would have forced an otherwise speeding</i><br>
<i>&gt; driver to slow down, because I was in front of him.  Instead, I wasn't there,</i><br>
<i>&gt; so he was able to speed through the red light where he killed two pedestrians.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I think we should not forget to focus on the fact that the "freedom to do<br>
what you like so long as you don't harm anyone else" also means that<br>
everyone else has the freedom to take measures to prevent inadvertant ill<br>
effects of someone elses actions.  Call it the freedom to take <br>
responsibility for ones own safety.<br>
