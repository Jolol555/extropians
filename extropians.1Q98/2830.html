<i>        &gt;So John, what did you think of my "Truth Machines and Open Networks"        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;post (a prediction of how open networks could create absolute truth)?         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;It suffers none of the problems you associate with Brin's idea </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
Seems to me it has exactly the same problems as Brin's. You could never <br>
obtain absolute truth from your One True Open Network (OTON) because if the <br>
entire world's operation is based on it's information then people would have <br>
enormous incentive to shape that information and change "the truth" to their <br>
liking. Since everything is open I know exactly how OTON works and all about <br>
its security, I can hack in and alter records and make history be anything I <br>
want. It does no good to make an exception to the total openness policy for <br>
OTON itself because that's by far the most important thing in the world and <br>
if that's not open nothing is, besides, although you might reduce the risk <br>
from hackers you'd vastly increase the meddling of the truth from world <br>
leaders, that is, from the network administrators.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;encryption and fast machine-based organisation doesn't mix) </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
That's not true at all. A good one key encryption algorithm, the sort you'd <br>
use to store information on a hard disk, slows things down by very little. <br>
Public key encryption is a little slower but still not bad and machines are <br>
getting so fast you'll soon never notice the slowdown. Ever though it's fast <br>
it offers excellent security, because to break it you'd need to factor the<br>
public key number and that would take a HUGE amount of cleverness or a COSMIC <br>
amount of patience. <br>
<p>
Today most keys are about a thousand bits long and no computer is close to <br>
being able break it. Some people are really paranoid and make their key 4 or <br>
5 thousand bits long, you will not be  able to find enough silicon in the <br>
observable universe to make enough chips for a computer to factor such a <br>
number before the heat death of the cosmos. Unless a new factoring algorithm <br>
is found that's a LOT faster than anything we know about today (if it only <br>
speeded things up a trillion times it would be useless) then such a key will <br>
never be broken. Until of course somebody makes a Quantum Computer.  <br>
               <br>

If I told you I'd have to kill you. (:&gt;)<br>
