<i>&gt; From:          Michael Lorrey &lt;mike@lorrey.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ah, so you are referring to a central banking system as the point of</i><br>
<i>&gt; central 'control'. This is an accurate assessment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, it is not apparent that this is a 'bad' thing, at least not</i><br>
<i>&gt; currently. As the 1920's demonstrated, failing to impose any form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; negative feedback on a system will cause that system to quickly cycle out</i><br>
<i>&gt; of control as any competent engineer can tell you (like oversteer on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; truck steering system).</i><br>
<p>
Upon closer examination, we find that in previous years (prior to the <br>
formation of the Federal Reserve system), the economy did *not* cycle <br>
quickly out of control; in fact there is some evidence that the <br>
federal government *tried* to make it do so, but was thwarted by J. <br>
P. Morgan's impromptu assembly of a consortium of major banks which <br>
collectively provided deposit insurance to bank customers (including <br>
the customers of banks which weren't part of the consortium, with <br>
only a very few exceptions specifically stated).<br>
<p>
And that in the 1920s, there WAS a central bank functioning as a <br>
point of central control in the United States -- and that it served <br>
quite well as a source of POSITIVE FEEDBACK.  Whatever the economy <br>
appeared to be doing, it would push for even more of.  This of course <br>
soon put the economy in an unstable situation, so beginning in <br>
late 1928 or early 1929 the economy tried to contract and throw off <br>
some non-viable debris (bad investments) -- and the Federal Reserve <br>
continued to provide positive feedback, demanding even more and <br>
faster contraction.<br>
<p>
Eliminating the Federal Reserve is the economic equivalent of <br>
disarming a large explosive device.  A large explosive device can be <br>
very useful, or very destructive, depending on exactly where and <br>
when it blows up.  This particular one happens to wander around on <br>
its own and can't be trusted.<br>
