It seems that many have missed the first, admittedly somewhat informal<br>
announcement -- hence this repost. <br>
<p>
The list is currently not being moderated, but will be as soon as traffic<br>
goes up in volume. Slowly, but surely &gt;Htech related forwards to the &gt;H<br>
list and extropians will cease.  As an experiment, we will be<br>
investigating distributed moderation of (subscriber-submitted) content --<br>
the truly smart web crawlers. As a side effect, this nicely takes care of<br>
spam.<br>
<p>
This is _not_ about further transhumanist balcanization, but should be<br>
seen as an attempt to further contribute to the diversity of information<br>
channels, to better fit your personal needs. Hopefully.<br>
<p>
Contributions are solicited.<br>

0. TRANSHUMANTECH<br>
 Mailing List <br>
<p>
 This list is dedicated to the logical<br>
 discussion of technologies of<br>
 interest to transhumanists. <br>
<p>
 1. An Introduction to<br>
 Transhumanism <br>
<p>
 Transhumanism is the idea of<br>
 extending the biological object<br>
 human through the use of<br>
 high-level technology or other<br>
 rational means. The Transhuman<br>
 is supposed to have a superior<br>
 body and/or mind. Research in<br>
 Transhumanism covers<br>
 technologies like cryonics,<br>
 neurosciences, artificial<br>
 intelligence, genetic engineering,<br>
 nanotechnology, drugs and life<br>
 extension. <br>
<p>
 All these technologies are complex<br>
 and there are lots of books about<br>
 each one. Many of them promise<br>
 impressive progress in the future<br>
 and maybe the Transcension of<br>
 humankind. Transcension is no<br>
 esoterical new age expression, it<br>
 simply means the creation of<br>
 Posthumans. People who want to<br>
 further this goal and / or to become<br>
 Transhuman in the future may call<br>
 themselves Transhumanists. <br>
<p>
 2. What is Homo Excelsior? <br>
<p>
 Homo Excelsior is a magazine that<br>
 is released on the web, as an<br>
 ASCII file and as a compressed<br>
 archive of the web version. It<br>
 covers all topics of interest to<br>
 Transhumanists, including book<br>
 references, internet addresses and<br>
 original articles. Its major goal is to<br>
 further the Transcension, to outline<br>
 dangers and possibilities and to<br>
 show implications on society and<br>
 power structures. <br>
<p>

<p>

 Excelsior lists, send mail to<br>

 remove you in any way, shape or<br>
 form. <br>
