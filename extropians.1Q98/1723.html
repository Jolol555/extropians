Well, IMHO, these are also examples of  'virtual reallity menthal states<br>
special effects'... (just occidentallizing...)<br>
<p>
( in a near future will have specific CD's for simulating such effects...)<br>

PS1: religions development is very based on the merchandisings of such<br>
things....<br>
PS2: the comments bellow are scientific and are very good to dismistify<br>
such effects...great analisys !!!!<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; The fifth "rapture" circuit is less well understood, but I think it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; fairly clear that these states appear so often in the literature (both</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; mystical and psychological) that they can be said to be real. They are</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; however not well understood, and it is by no means clear that they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; all due to the same circuit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Mystical experiences may be grouped together, but I'm not sure they</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; form useful circuits.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The main problem being that perhaps different experiences are frequently</i><br>
<i>&gt;confused or wrongly organized in a vertical hierarchy ,although they</i><br>
<i>&gt;are  completely different phenomena. It's interesting to notice that</i><br>
<i>&gt;Timothy Leary created the circuits theory in the 70's, and simply forgot</i><br>
<i>&gt;it during the following years (the circuits came back with "Design for</i><br>
<i>&gt;dying", but, for various reasons,  this book is atypical).</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is apparently a "rapture" experience, which can be summarized by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the loss of the sensation of body's limits. This can be expressed as an</i><br>
<i>&gt;"out of the body experience", as a disappearing of the body (yoga), or</i><br>
<i>&gt;as a fusion between the body and environment. I'm not sure this can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;categorized as a superior circuit or state of consciousness, but it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;fun , and gives certainly good results against stress and on body's</i><br>
<i>&gt;health.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The metaprogramming experience, that Leary names the sixth circuit could</i><br>
<i>&gt;be a completely different experience. I find it closer to ethological</i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanism of "insight", or, even better, to the Gregory Bateson's</i><br>
<i>&gt;concept "learning III". According Bateson, Learning I is the simple,</i><br>
<i>&gt;traditional, learning. Learning II (learning to learn) is the process</i><br>
<i>&gt;that, frequently through "insight", one can build a model of the world</i><br>
<i>&gt;based on previous experience (the monkey sees banana; the monkey sees</i><br>
<i>&gt;the rod; suddenly, the monkey has a mystical flash and takes the banana</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the rod; he just created a new model of the world, where things can</i><br>
<i>&gt;be used as tools). Leaning III (learning to learn to learn) is a more</i><br>
<i>&gt;complex experience where one's own model of the world is seen as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;relative reality, and can therefore be changed. This is the mystical</i><br>
<i>&gt;crisis, the conversion process, the Zen's satori.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The two states, the "rapture" and the "satori" are frequently confused</i><br>
<i>&gt;because the rapture experience can be so shocking that it can lead to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;mystical crisis, at least on the first time. On the other side, a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;intense satori, which "deconstructs" one's world model, can lead to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;state of rapture (because the body's limits are also a psychological</i><br>
<i>&gt;construction).</i><br>
<i>&gt;The difference between the rapture and the satori can be an explanation</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the fundamental difference between hindu and buddhic mysticism. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;first assumes that the highest rapture state (samadhi) is an expression</i><br>
<i>&gt;of reality, but buddhists claims that one can only understand reality</i><br>
<i>&gt;through awakening or crisis, rapture states being just a tool. As it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;easier to experiment rapture than awakening, the confusion between the</i><br>
<i>&gt;states began also to invade buddhism, until the "revolt" of the Rinzai</i><br>
<i>&gt;Zen masters, who chose to abandon the rapture way to awakening to use</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead a kind of shock therapy through violent or absurd behavior.</i><br>
