If you do that, the capacity of the memory store would only grow as the<br>
log of the volume. Is it possible to do better, or is there an upper bound<br>
of M*log V on the entropy of an isolated system? (Well that is clearly not<br>
true since a black hole has entropy proportional to M*V^(1/3), but perhaps<br>
the bound holds when M is small compared to V?)<br>

Another problem is once you've stored information as the position of a<br>
particle, how do you then retrieve it?<br>

<i>&gt; In The Physics of Immortality, Frank Tipler argues that open universes</i><br>

<i>&gt; Here is what he says, on page 139 (chapter 3, section "Experimental Tests</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the Omega Point Theory"):</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "As I discussed in Chapter III, Freeman Dyson pointed out that, although</i><br>
<i>&gt; the energy is available in open and flat universes, the information</i><br>
<i>&gt; processing must be carried out over larger and larger proper volumes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This fact ultimately makes impossible any communication between opposite</i><br>
<i>&gt; sides of the 'living' region in a flat universe, because the redshift</i><br>
<i>&gt; implies that arbitrarily large amounts of energy must be used to signal,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Dyson showed that only a finite amount of energy is availble.</i><br>
<i>&gt; On the other hand, open universes expand so fast in the far future that</i><br>
<i>&gt; it becomes impossible for structures to form of sufficiently larger and</i><br>
<i>&gt; larger size to store a diverging amount of information."</i><br>
<p>
I don't understand why it would be impossible to form larger and larger<br>
structures. I imagine that a structure would be gravationally bound and<br>
contain a reserve of free energy to expand as needed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; He may be saying that at some point there won't be enough energy in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the whole universe to create a single photon of enough energy to signal</i><br>
<i>&gt; from one side of the computer to the other.  Apparently there is only a</i><br>
<i>&gt; finite amount of energy in the (accessible?) universe.  But I'm not sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; that there is a threshold energy which would be necessary to create the</i><br>
<i>&gt; signalling photon; perhaps photons can have arbitrarily small energies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as long as they are hotter than the background.</i><br>
<p>
If your computer is reversible, you shouldn't have to use up any energy<br>
for computation, so this situation shouldn't come up.<br>
