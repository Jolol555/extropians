It's closing in on 10 years since David Gelernter<br>
first proposed his vision of all-encompassing "Mirror<br>
Worlds". Yak Wax says:<br>
&lt; For instance, if I go and fill my car with petrol<br>
the transaction can be automatically made.  This is<br>
because somewhere within the network environment I've<br>
created a piece of information stating that I used<br>
the pump. This just happens to be the way the World<br>
Wide Web is progressing (and if you don't believe me<br>
ask the W3C.) &gt;<br>
<p>
I just linked from Amazon to UPS to track my book<br>
order and saw that the package was scanned in my<br>
local post office this morning.  This is useful<br>
information but is supported by strictly commercial<br>
interests and it is not available to everyone,<br>
besides, who else would care?  When I filled my car<br>
up with gasoline the other night (using a credit card<br>
at the pump), the transaction was sent to the company<br>
via satellite.  This data is not likely to be<br>
available on the Web any time soon.  When I purchased<br>
my groceries, the company recorded the scanned<br>
information in a private database, which they will<br>
aggregate with millions of other transactions and<br>
sell as purchasing trends information back to the<br>
consumer products companies - they're not about to<br>
make this data freely available.<br>
<p>
As David Gelernter puts it at<br>
<a href="http://www.mirrorworlds.com/horizons/">http://www.mirrorworlds.com/horizons/</a><br>
&lt; in a society where researchers and practitioners<br>
lead wholly different lives, where practitioners are<br>
rich and researchers remain stolidly middle-class --<br>
research will only attract a handful of fanatics. &gt;<br>
<p>
Wax waxes about how:<br>
&lt; Eventually, every single thing you do will be<br>
stored on the network. &gt;<br>
<p>
Why and where?  It's one thing to have 'everything'<br>
being transmitted over 'The Net', it's quite<br>
something else again to have everything *stored*<br>
somewhere that anyone can access.  The only thing I<br>
can see that would make Gelernter's 'ideal' a reality<br>
is for a world government to mandate that all<br>
transactions and transmissions by stored centrally -<br>
just think of all the 'optimizing' 'mechanism design'<br>
policies the central planners could then dream up!<br>
<p>
On the other hand, read Greg Bear's novel SLANT for<br>
some ideas on who might have commercial interests in<br>
tracking all the urinalysis samples collected by<br>
intelligent toilets attached to the Net...<br>
