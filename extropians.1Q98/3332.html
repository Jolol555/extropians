<p>
Re:    Alcor Conference 3-5 April, 1998 in Phoenix, AZ<br>
<p>
<p>
*** Just Confirmed!  Max More, President of the Extropy Institute, will be<br>
<p>
participating in two key panels at the conference.<br>
<p>
<p>
In the first panel, to be chaired by Marvin Minsky at the Saturday Evening<br>
<p>
Banquet ("What's in it for me?") the basic question is, "Why should *you*<br>
<p>
want to be there in the future, both near term and indefinitely thereafter?"<br>
<p>
The next morning, Max will be one of the panelists in a session led by James<br>
<p>
Halperin on "Identity and Reanimation" ***<br>
<p>
<p>
Below you will find registration information and an updated schedule.  This<br>
<p>
Conference is almost certain *not* to remain an annual event.  This might be<br>
<p>
your last chance to attend a large scale, national cryonics conference<br>
<p>
before the year 2000 or 2001.<br>
<p>
<p>
Extensive details are on Alcor's website, at <a href="http://www.alcor.org">http://www.alcor.org</a> (just<br>
<p>
click on "Conference").  The info below is updated as of 3/19/98, and is the<br>
<p>
most reliable data on the program and how to register. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
Regular Rate - $149 (applies to all registrations, but space is not<br>
<p>
guaranteed at the sessions or banquet if you register after March 30, 1998<br>
<p>
or at the door.  - in case of limited seating capacity, those who registered<br>
<p>
earlier will have higher priority.)  Register by phone: (800)367-2228; Ask<br>

<p>
Re: Alcor Conference - Why You Should Be There!<br>
<p>
Date: 3/18/98<br>
<p>
<p>
Many cryonicists have told me (and I understand) that due to the meager time<br>
<p>
left and other commitments, they cannot attend.  They all say:<br>
<p>
<p>
"I'll be there next year!"<br>
<p>
<p>
To repeat, I understand!  I wish we could have had the information to you<br>
<p>
earlier, but there are  still reasons to consider attending!<br>
<p>
<p>
WHAT YOU MISS IF YOU DON'T COME.<br>
<p>
<p>
(1)  The speakers and panel leaders for this year are pretty awesome, and we<br>
<p>
can't hope to have a program like this on an annual basis.  Marvin Minsky<br>
<p>
and James Halperin, for example, are both wedging us onto their calendars<br>
<p>
this year.  This is a "four leaf clover" level of luck for us.  On the "five<br>
<p>
leaf clover" level, Greg Fahy is speaking, as well as key investigators from<br>
<p>
21st Century Medicine, Inc.  Their work over the last 3-5 years represents<br>
<p>
profound innovation in resuscitation technologies and new cryobiological<br>
<p>
approaches.  Professionals from a major investment firm (Smith Barney) will<br>
<p>
be talking about financing cryonics and preserving wealth.  Full information<br>
<p>
is out, in hard copy and on the web.  I don't have to repeat it for you here.<br>
<p>
<p>
NO CONFERENCE NEXT YEAR?<br>
<p>
<p>
(2)  This year's conference would be a hard act to follow.  The next year<br>
<p>
will see the startup of a major cryonics service corporation, BioTransport,<br>
<p>
Inc.  A major push will take place to carry research into general<br>
<p>
availability for cryonics suspensions.  Research will continue at a high<br>
<p>
pace, by 21st Century Medicine, Inc.  Another conference next year would be<br>
<p>
unrealistic!  You may expect 2-3 year intervals, for the near term.<br>
<p>
<p>
ALL REGISTRATION FEES AT REGULAR RATE!<br>
<p>
<p>
(3)  In some cases, we could not confirm key speakers until weeks ago.  This<br>
<p>
highlights the difficulties of organizing an annual, national level cryonics<br>
<p>
conference.  It also points out the difficulties of attendees planning ahead<br>
<p>
for it.  Because of the short notice given, we are holding conference<br>
<p>
registration fees at regular rate, but there is a catch: we must base the<br>
<p>
size of room we get on the number of attendees we predict.  The same goes<br>
<p>
for banquet seating.  In case of seating limitations, those who register<br>
<p>
earlier will have higher priority.<br>
<p>
<p>
PANEL DISCUSSION - "CRYONICS SERVICE PROVIDERS"<br>
<p>
<p>
One speaker slot has opened up.  Rather than fill this time with an<br>
<p>
alternate presentation (there are plenty of backup speakers) we are<br>
<p>
organizing a panel discussion on "rescue services" organizations.  You will<br>
<p>
have heard one talk on BioTransport, Inc., a  new corporation which is<br>
<p>
negotiating with both Alcor and CryoCare, but there is the longer term to<br>
<p>
consider, as well as what tradeoffs there might be over the next few years.<br>
<p>
<p>
***** Is a Six Phase Development Plan Best? *****<br>
<p>
<p>
BioTransport proposes to first deliver services in the area of (1) training,<br>
<p>
(2) logistics of medications and equipment, and (3) internet based advisory<br>
<p>
services for field linkage to research center professionals.  Then it<br>
<p>
proposes to move into furnishing (4) field coordinators, (5) complete teams,<br>
<p>
and finally (6) complete contractual patient care from standby through<br>
<p>
cooldown.  Is this the best course of development?<br>
<p>
<p>
***** What About Alternative Technologies? *****<br>
<p>
<p>
As vitrification becomes practical (although probably more expensive), what<br>
<p>
other options should be under development for more affordability?  How much<br>
<p>
research priority should be given to the development of these options?  How<br>
<p>
important will rescue be, under various scenarios?  If a point is reached<br>
<p>
where cryonics becomes "popular", how can the enigmas of high cost and wide<br>
<p>
public demand be resolved?<br>
<p>
<p>
***** How About Competition As An Important Safeguard? *****<br>
<p>
<p>
In any important service area, lack of competition can lead to complacency<br>
<p>
and (worse) loss of service in the event of a single company's failure.  On<br>
<p>
the other hand, too much competition, too soon, causes a shift of resources<br>
<p>
into marketing and away from actual service delivery.  As cryonics grows,<br>
<p>
how can these opposing priorities be balanced?  Should regional centers be<br>
<p>
"spun off" as separate, autonomous service providers, operating under the<br>
<p>
quality agreements of a professional association to which they all<br>
<p>
subscribe?  How can reliability, affordability, quality and high ethical<br>
<p>
standards best be maintained in a competitive context?  How are all of these<br>
<p>
questions affected by the fact that cryonics is, as yet, an "unproven"<br>
<p>
procedure in any case?<br>
<p>
<p>
***** Other Obvious Questions *****<br>
<p>
<p>
We might also ask:  "What are the consequences, if we assume that "these<br>
<p>
"things will take care of themselves"? or "Why haven't we asked these<br>
<p>
questions *earlier*?"  Readers of CryoNet, perhaps can suggest many other<br>
<p>
questions related to service provider development, in the next week or so,<br>
<p>
but clearly, the best way to get these questions answered is to come to the<br>
<p>
conference and ask them yourselves! <br>
<p>
<p>
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO MISS THIS CONFERENCE???<br>
<p>
<p>
Many of you have made arrangements for suspension, and are trusting in your<br>
<p>
organizations to be there when you need them, to suspend you, to keep you<br>
<p>
safe for decades and then "get you back if possible" at the other end.  This<br>
<p>
is a complicated chain of events you have set in motion, and it is not<br>
<p>
inexpensive.  You have made a large commitment to be part of the world of<br>
<p>
the future, and what you have working for you, basically, is the entire<br>
<p>
"community" of all existing cryonics organizations.<br>
<p>
<p>
This conference  will lead to mindsets and goals which affect your survival.<br>
<p>
Not *all* of you can be there, but those of you who can be, *should* be!<br>
<p>
<p>
Here's what's necessary:<br>
<p>
<p>
(1) Call Joe Hovey (Alcor) to register, at (800)367-2228.<br>
<p>
(2) Call the hotel to reserve a room, code "ALC", at (602)273-7778.<br>
<p>
(3) Call an airline and make a reservation, or gas up your car!<br>
<p>
(4) One way or another, *be* there!  (Your life is at stake!)<br>
