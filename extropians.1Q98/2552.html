What somebody does is more important than how they do it. Decreeing the moral  <br>
superiority of analog over digital is as arbitrary as claiming that white <br>
skin is good and black skin is bad. Besides, the question is probably moot.<br>

I have no idea where you got that figure but I have a very strong hunch that <br>
everything is digital. We already know that English is digital (26) so are <br>
the letters in the  genetic code (4) the number of natural elements is <br>
digital (92) and the speed light can move at in a vacuum (1). Spin is digital, <br>
so is the quantity of electric charge (1/3e), and the type of electric charge <br>
(2), and baryon  number, and electron family number, and muon family number, <br>
and magnetic  moment, and parity, and the number (6) of different types of <br>
quarks, and the  number (3) of "color" charges that quarks come in. <br>
<p>
Polarization is digital. Pick a direction at random, and for any photon of <br>
unknown polarization there are only 2 choices, it must be polarized in that <br>
direction or at right angles to it. If it makes it through your polarization <br>
filter, it could make it through a thousand set in the same direction, and so <br>
could any twin photon correlated with it. If it doesn't make it through then <br>
the photon was polarized at right angles to the polarization filter, as can <br>
be proven by the correlated photon. <br>
<p>
<p>
Even space and time are probably digital. Today's Physics can tell us nothing  <br>
about what happens when time gets smaller than The Plank Time of 5.4 * 10^-44 <br>
second or distance gets  smaller than The Plank Length of 10^-33 cm, photons <br>
of that wavelength are so  small and have so much energy that they become <br>
Black Holes, and Black Holes contain a singularity. We had no choice, we've <br>
already made a defacto  quantization of space-time. However, I admit we can't <br>
be certain that it's for real, because at these very small distances Quantum <br>
Mechanics and General Relativity are not  compatible, so obviously the last <br>
word has not been spoken.  We need a quantum theory of gravity before we can <br>
know for sure.                                   <br>
