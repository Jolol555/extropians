<p>
  There is also the E-Lamp, which is like a fluorescent lamp, ecept that the<br>
gasses inside get excited by radio waves generated by a coil in the base of the<br>
lamp. These are about 20% more efficient than compact fluorescents and don't<br>
require the ugly tube mess.<br>
<p>
Another development you can look at on my web site<br>
<a href="http://homepages.together.net/~retroman/">http://homepages.together.net/~retroman/</a> and follow the 'business' link to my<br>
Northstar Technologies and Lighting page. This product I developed in 1991 and<br>
92, did market research, got manufacturing set up and brought to market. It is a<br>
retrofit kit for exit signs. Compared to an incandescent lit exit sign, my EL<br>
Retrofit Kit was 99.7% efficient, and while incandescent lamps last for a few<br>
months, my lamp lasts for 30 years, with a 10 year guarrantee. We sold these from<br>
92-95 mostly in the Northwest, but also in California and scattered locations<br>
around the country, for around $65.00 (at which point I was breaking even, due to<br>
the cost of the technology. WHile this sounds like a lot, these kits were able to<br>
save the owners between $1000-4000 over a 20-30 year period.<br>
<p>
Why didn't we clean up the market? three main reasons:<br>
1) the energy conservation rebate programs funded by the energy department and<br>
your local utilities set fixed dollar rates for any retrofit of a certain minimum<br>
efficiency. Because more efficient retrofits tend to use more expensive<br>
technology, the less efficient technologies get a preponderance of  the<br>
subsidies, since a larger percentage of their cost gets paid for by the<br>
government as opposed to the end user, so people are more likely to buy the least<br>
efficient/least cost solution that meets the minimum requirements to earn rebates<br>
from the government. Since ours was the most efficient, we were the most biased<br>
against in the market by these government programs.<br>
<p>
2) Our manufacturer, Loctite/Luminescent Systems, Inc., which at the time was the<br>
only company with the technology to give us that 30 year life/10 year warrantee,<br>
lied to us about thier focus on developing our product to the point that we got<br>
18 months behind schedule, and lost a big advantage in our marketing window. (I<br>
wound up getting several of the top people there fired over that)<br>
<p>
3) because of this loss of time, the big lighting companies were able to come out<br>
with retrofit kits using LEDs that were not as efficient as ours (3-4 watts as<br>
opposed to our 1/3 of one watt), but were half of our cost, so they were able to<br>
gain marketshare much quicker, and used the earned credibility of that<br>
marketshare to unjustifiably smear our technology and our company.<br>
<p>
Now, outside of these LED kits being made by chinese slaves, I really cannot say<br>
anything bad about them, except possibly that they were not quite as efficient as<br>
my product. They are moving the market from use of 2 20 watts bulbs to one 3-4<br>
watt kit in each exit sign, which is a good thing.<br>
<p>
As for myself, we sold over 6000 kits, and I learned a lot about business. My<br>
kits are saving 48,000 kilowatt hours a year around the country, and thousands of<br>
hours of labor and dollars of bulb expenses. So, I've got a lot of good karma<br>
from that, at the very least.<br>
<p>
However, my story is an excellent example of how government takes good ideas an<br>
royally fucks them up so that the policies that are suppose to attain those ideas<br>
actually impede them.<br>
