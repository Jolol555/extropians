<i>&gt;&gt; Catching them is the trickiest part.  In my model colonists are moving at </i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; takes exponentially more resources to try to catch up.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, the enforcers would have to be other colonists in the same area.</i><br>
<p>
In my model, colonization without property rights happens at the fastest <br>
possible speed, so if property rights had any effect it would be to <br>
reduce the speed of colonization.  So if any "sooners" slipped ahead<br>
of the colonization wave, the cost to catch them becomes roughly <br>
exponential in how far ahead they slipped.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Also, by the time you detect a violation and arrive in force, new seeds </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; have already been flying for years off to parts unknown.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can imagine an enforcement system where all descendants of property</i><br>
<i>&gt;right violators would be stigmatized and attacked whenever they meet</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-violators.</i><br>
<p>
You'd need to stigmatize all probes which couldn't verify their ancestry<br>
at legit oases.  And if they stayed ahead of the wave of property folks, <br>
they may not care about the stigma. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If large areas of the colonization wavefront are composed of colonists </i><br>
<i>&gt;that share common ancestry, property right violations might occur only </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the borders between such areas. </i><br>
<p>
This might make it easier to enforce property rights within a region,<br>
but regions should still fear falling too far behind competing neighboring <br>
regions.  So a pressure for maximum speed still seems to apply.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;How would your model change if property rights could be enforced?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; It would be a lot more complicated :-).  I haven't modeled that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Things should be fairly simple if property rights are perfect. There would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be an initial allocation of rights before the colonists leave their home</i><br>
<i>&gt;planet, and then each colonist should be able to independently optimize</i><br>
<i>&gt;his colonization strategy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I guess the complexities would come in if property rights are not perfect,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the end results would be very sensitive to exactly what rights are</i><br>
<i>&gt;enforceable and to what extent.</i><br>
<p>
The nice thing about the no-property-rights analysis is that<br>
behavior and values can be predicted purely from a selection effect. <br>
If property rights can change behavior, behavior should be based on actor<br>
values, that I'm not sure how to predict.  <br>
