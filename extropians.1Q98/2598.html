<i>&gt;The recent discussion of IT workers and their economic value has</i><br>
<i>&gt;led me once again to wonder about extropian and libertarian views</i><br>
<i>&gt;of "labor unions" in general.  Principles of individual autonomy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;economic liberty and spontaneous order should, it seems lead to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the conclusion that workers should be free to form associations</i><br>
<i>&gt;designed to leverage their economic value.  At the most</i><br>
<i>&gt;general level of abstraction, there is no good reason workers with</i><br>
<i>&gt;a common skill shouldn't be able to band together to increase</i><br>
<i>&gt;their bargaining power. On the other hand, I have a hard time</i><br>
<i>&gt;seeing how collective labor bargaining arrangements could survive</i><br>
<i>&gt;in a competitive environment absent some state-sanctioned legal</i><br>
<i>&gt;monopoly power or the use of violence to block breaches by</i><br>
<i>&gt;labor-purchasers or defections of labor sellers, both antithetical</i><br>
<i>&gt;to libertarian and extropian principles.</i><br>
<p>
You are making some excellent points, the ideal we strive for is<br>
just as you mentioned, workers with the same general skill set<br>
freely associating to leverage economic value. <br>
<p>
In the 18 years I've held a union card I've never once seen any<br>
govt state or local intervene on behalf of a union, quite the<br>
opposite, I've seen congressional imposition of exactly what the<br>
company wanted, I've seen the president arbitrarily disband a union<br>
(which subsequently reformed). I've never once seen the democratic<br>
party do anything for organized labor which is why I'm one of those<br>
who wants to cut their funding.<br>
<p>
We survive by staying cutting edge, and rely on the courts to<br>
support existing contracts.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;One idea I have had is that "libertarian labor unions" could</i><br>
<i>&gt;create value that would deter breaches and defections by becoming</i><br>
<i>&gt;certification agencies.  A union of skilled workers could back</i><br>
<i>&gt;their contracts with labor-buyers with certifications of skill of</i><br>
<i>&gt;their member-workers.  Labor buyers might well prefer exclusive</i><br>
<i>&gt;arrangements with such unions because it would externalize</i><br>
<i>&gt;the cost of training and certification and such certification</i><br>
<i>&gt;would add value to their own products and contracts.  Of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt;there would likely be competition in many areas between multiple</i><br>
<i>&gt;certification unions, but that would be completely in keeping with</i><br>
<i>&gt;libertarian and extropian ideals.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm curious what others here have thought about these ideas.</i><br>
<p>
We're on the same page, we recently re-opened our revamped<br>
apprenticeship program for communications electricians, besides the<br>
usual cabling (including fiber) and telephony classes there are<br>
classes on packet switching, and on LANS/WANS etc. The goal is also<br>
to develop 100% computer literacy to the WIN95 level. Established<br>
within the new infrastructure are programs to review and upgrade<br>
this as necessary. This is paid for by monies contributed by all<br>
union contractors. This program is also open to all existing<br>
Journeymen as continual education. We are also trying to interest<br>
individual companies (I work for Ameritech the midwest RBOC) to<br>
sponsor additional classes on a Sat (nonpaid) basis. I have also<br>
brought up the fact that it would be trivial for us to turn out our<br>
own CNE's, etc. (I've run 10 Novell servers for nearly a decade)<br>
<p>
The idea is to maintain our status by being the best in the<br>
industry, period.<br>
<p>
You should have seen our last contract negotiation, it started out<br>
with sitting down, opening up the laptop, calling up the Excel<br>
spreadsheets and commencing with " I thought we'd start by going<br>
over the company financial's (Ameritech negotiation talks were<br>
separate) including the recent 6% dividend increase to<br>
stockholders, the 2 billion stock buyback and the 2-1 split. then<br>
we could look at management compensation over the last three<br>
years."<br>
<p>
We settled for a nice three year deal at an average increase of<br>
4.4% (we are very reasonable).<br>
