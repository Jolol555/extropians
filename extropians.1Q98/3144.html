<i>&gt; &gt; I know I don't like the requirement for unanimous verdicts.  A 5/6 </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; majority should be sufficient for a guilty verdict, or a simple </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; majority for a not-guilty verdict.  (However, in capital crimes, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; death penalty *should* *not* be an option unless the verdict was </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unanimous.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Isn't the idea of unanimous verdicts to provide an extra measure of</i><br>
<i>&gt; protection to minimize the number of innocent people sent to prison? </i><br>
<p>
Yes, but I think it's overdone in a situation where the government <br>
mandates racism, and should be tossed, but in a manner that is <br>
either balanced or weighted in favor of the defendant.<br>
<p>
Note both sides:<br>
<p>
For a guilty verdict, a 5/6 majority<br>
   or<br>
For a not-guilty verdict, a simple majority.<br>
<p>
With a six-person jury, there are seven possible vote outcomes <br>
(ignoring abstentions): anywhere from 0-6 to 6-0.  Today, exactly one <br>
outcome results in acquittal, and exactly one results in conviction; <br>
the other five result in mistrial and the possibility of having to do <br>
it all over again.<br>
<p>
With my proposal, it is true that two outcomes result in conviction; <br>
but THREE result in acquittal and only two result in mistrial and a <br>
rerun.<br>
<p>
On a twelve-person jury, there are thirteen possible vote outcomes.  <br>
Exactly one results in acquittal, and exactly one results in <br>
conviction, with eleven leading to possible retrials.  With my <br>
proposal three would result in conviction and six in acquittal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A</i><br>
<i>&gt; 5/6 requirement would send more guilty people to jail, but also more</i><br>
<i>&gt; innocent ones.</i><br>
<p>
A simple majority for acquittal would send more innocent people home <br>
without having to fret about a retrial.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As it is, even unanimous juries make many mistakes. A lot</i><br>
<i>&gt; of convictions are overturned after new evidence comes out after the</i><br>
<i>&gt; trial.</i><br>
<p>
I don't consider that a mistake on the jury's part.  If there's an <br>
error, it's on the part of the investigators for not finding that <br>
evidence in the first place, or on the part of the people who had the <br>
evidence for not bringing it forward sooner.  The jury cannot be held <br>
at fault for not considering the unknown.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Considering that most criminal defendants have to go against all of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources of the state with one overworked public defender, I don't want</i><br>
<i>&gt; to make it any easier for the state.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, a 5/6 requirement would make jury nullification more difficult.</i><br>
<p>
This is unfortunately true.  My response is outside the scope of <br>
this particular proposal; but I'll state it anyway: a complete <br>
revamping of the way the court treats the jury, including but not <br>
limited to informing the jury IN ADVANCE of the trial that it is <br>
their DUTY to judge the law as well as the defendant.  Legislation <br>
should not deal with exceptional cases; the courts should in every <br>
case evaluate whether justice is served by applying the law to the <br>
specific case.  If a law is in itself unjust, the answer will rarely <br>
be "yes".<br>
