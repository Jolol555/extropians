<i>&gt; distributing support on the basis of race, family-status,</i><br>
<i>&gt; chemical-addictions or sexual orentation. This is a _US_ problem however,</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't use this as an argument against governemental systems elsewhere that</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't suffer from these faults.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Currently the government only does this if the state Governor asks the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;President to declare a disaster area. If you are not in a declared area,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;then the government system doesn't owe you anything, which stinks.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; More _US_ policy problems, not a general case. I suggest you get yourself a</i><br>
<i>&gt; decent gov before you start bashing Europeans ones of which you apparently</i><br>
<i>&gt; know very little.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;If you think that the government is responsible for protecting your</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;personal security, you are severely misinformed. Police are only there</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;to catch the bad guy AFTER he has robbed, raped or killed you, not to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;prevent it from happening.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; No offence but I think I'm better informed about _Dutch_ law-enforcement</i><br>
<i>&gt; policies than you are. Prevention of crime (and thus, effectively,</i><br>
<i>&gt; protection of citizens) is just as important as 'catching the bad guys',</i><br>
<i>&gt; and resources are allocated accordingly (IMHO a good thing, prevention is</i><br>
<i>&gt; better for the would-be victims and more cost-effective).</i><br>
<p>
And your freedom is confiscated accordingly as well. There are so many people here<br>
in the US because european governments have always considered security paramount<br>
over individual rights. Of course that means that most people left there have a<br>
greater herd tendency than people here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  (concerning the dike-enhancement plan)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;I don't imagine that the Dutch Government was the contractor that did</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;the work, was it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually it was, some of the equipment was so expensive and specialized,</i><br>
<i>&gt; custom designed for the project, that no company would consider investing</i><br>
<i>&gt; in it (and by expensive I mean you you should think 'Apollo project'). Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course commercial contractors were also brought in but a governement</i><br>
<i>&gt; ministery ran the whole thing.</i><br>
<p>
While the Apollo was laujnched by Nasa, it was built by contractors. Of course I'm<br>
not familiar enough with the Dutch gov't to judge in this particular case, but<br>
typically all a govt agency does when it hires a contractor to do a job is figure<br>
out as many ways to make the job as difficult and expensive and convoluted as<br>
possible, as well as giving every other ministry an open season to pile on more<br>
requirements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Since most of your country is in a flood plain (partly</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;man-made), it is obvious that your country is essentially what is known</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;as a "planned community".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think the Netherlands was planned in any way when it became</i><br>
<i>&gt; independant from Spain in the 17th century. A bunch of people simply filled</i><br>
<i>&gt; a power-vacuum, and tried to establish some sort of democracy (emphasizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'some sort'). From there it just developed slowly to what it is now. If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; mean by 'planned community' that there's a lot of complex legislature then</i><br>
<i>&gt; you're right. We have to plan with 15M people living on a piece of land not</i><br>
<i>&gt; 250 by 350 Km's and still being the worlds #4 in agricultural exports.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Its a rather large one, granted, such that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;has attained sovereign status as an independent nation, but it, at its</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;heart, is a planned community, much like smaller 'gated communities' that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;are springing up all over the US here.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Based on my limited knowledge about American 'gated communities' this</i><br>
<i>&gt; comparison is bogus and rather insulting too. The right to live in Holland</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not determined by productivity, there's no price tag for acces. All</i><br>
<i>&gt; citizens, no matter how unproductive, lazy or drug-addicted enjoy the</i><br>
<i>&gt; security of a basic income and medical facilities and such. In Holland</i><br>
<i>&gt; people are _free_ to _choose_ whether or not they want to become productive</i><br>
<i>&gt; (that's freedom! ;-). I think this is precisely the opposite from what a</i><br>
<i>&gt; gated community stands for.</i><br>
<p>
Thats certainly freedom for the those who are non-productive, but what about those<br>
who are productive? Making them foot the bill for everyone who wants to be lazy is<br>
slavery in its most abject form. What would happen if everyone decided to by<br>
unproductive? Who would pay the bills then?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Conversely, hardly anyone on earth has the ability to choose what country</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;to be a citizen of, and those who would prefer to not support the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;unproductive elements of society have no developed nation to which to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;emigrate to.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, it is interesting to see that there is a such a strong correlation to</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries that try to prevent their citizens from starving (even the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'unproductive' ones) and countries that we consider 'developed'.</i><br>
<p>
Developed nations typically are wealthy enough that there tends to grow a class of<br>
parasites who feed off the productive remainder. It is obvious that a nation that<br>
is not wealthy cannot afford to support such leaches, so they either get jobs or<br>
become'refugees' hoping to become parasites in a wealthier country.  As a small<br>
example, when Diane Feinstein (then mayor of San Francisco) expanded aid for<br>
homeless people fourfold, guess what happened? Did the homeless population<br>
suddenly become respectable citizens with disposable income and homes, etc? NO!<br>
What happened was that the homeless from every surrounding city that had less<br>
hospitable social policies toward bums migrated to San Francisco, to the point<br>
that they were camped out in front of City Hall like it was the streets of<br>
Calcutta.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What do you suggest we do with all the 'unproductive' people? Let them starve?</i><br>
<p>
Let them get a clue and become productive. Get jobs. Go to school. Learn<br>
SOMETHING.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You could be unproductive a few seconds from now, it only takes a broken</i><br>
<i>&gt; bloodvessel in the brain to reduce a single, white, able-bodied male to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; very crippled and very unproductive individual. I wish you a long and</i><br>
<i>&gt; healthy life of course, but do not fool yourself into believing it could</i><br>
<i>&gt; not happen to you. Then what? Do you have a big family that will take care</i><br>
<i>&gt; of you (or do they refuse to support 'unproductive individuals')</i><br>
<i>&gt; And what about the growing percentage of the population that is becoming</i><br>
<i>&gt; redundant by automation? We do not need strong AI to automate a</i><br>
<i>&gt; considerable part of the economy, the proces is happening right now.</i><br>
<p>
People do not become redundant, they merely are able to make more of their time<br>
available for occupations which are not so strenuous, not so monotonous. For<br>
example, the USPS is by and large, still the most un-automated large<br>
postal/shipping company here in the US. UPS and FedEx, by comparison, are not only<br>
automated, but highly networked and computerized. I think that it is not difficult<br>
to connect this fact with the fact that more USPS workers go on homicidal rampages<br>
than any other company, while UPS and Fed Ex employees are among the lowest.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  And later:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;I am using NH as an example of a state which is as close to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;libertarian optimum as one can currently find in the industrialized world,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;and how all stats indicating a 'livable' environment seem to be far above</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;that in any other industrialized polity I am aware of.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Point taken, having never visited NH so I'll take your word for it. My</i><br>
<i>&gt; original point (several posts ago ;-) was that the existance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'big-governement' does not necessarily lead to economic collapse or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; reduced growth.</i><br>
<p>
Economic collapse: Soviet Union, Poland, E Germany, Romania, Cuba, North Korea,<br>
Indonesia.All of which had large authoritarian, cradle to grave systems.  I'll get<br>
back to you on growth rates once I get a chance to research it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Michael Lorrey:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt;Other nations that have followed suit now enjoy stronger economies</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt;than their stagnant socialist neighbors.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  To which I replied:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;We have been over this before but maybe it did not register or something,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;the above sentence is abosulute and total B.S. (tough but that's what it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;European countries with the most extensive welfare systems like Germany and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;the Netherlands are the strongest economies on the continent. And their</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;currency's are a hell of a lot more stable than the US $.</i><br>
<p>
The US doesn't try to control its currency artificially like your countries do. We<br>
have more faith in the market's ability to be stable inherently, within an<br>
acceptable range. We also have a surplus budget (without massive per capita oil<br>
revinues, as the Dutch are so well endowed with, which is mainly the source of<br>
your ability to slouch as much as you wish). and lower unemployment. As to growth,<br>
let me do some research....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That was my point, if you want to state that welfare-systens are always bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; for an economy, prove it. But make sure you got your facts straight.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Michael Lorrey:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Various socialist sympathizers here have expressed disbeleif that such a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;system could result in anything but chaos, as they have no faith in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;ability of the common man to desire to live peacefully.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In stating my belief that the absence of a state leads to chaos I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; refecting on my experiences in several countries were a power-vacuum left</i><br>
<i>&gt; by a crumbling governement was quickly filled by drunks driving pick-ups</i><br>
<i>&gt; and shooting anythying that moves. I was talking about a situation were the</i><br>
<i>&gt; state is absent, not downsized, as you yourself seem to consider a 'good</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea'. I wonder what would happen to the US if the federal governement</i><br>
<i>&gt; ceased existing overnight (I'd watch from a safe distance though - remember</i><br>
<i>&gt; LA?).</i><br>
<p>
Yes, and LA has one of the highest tax rates and one of the most restrictive gun<br>
control laws in the entire nation. SOme stability. It also has one of the highest<br>
costs of living.<br>
