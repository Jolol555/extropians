The Outer Limits dates back to the 70's. It was contempory with The<br>
Twilight Zone. The 'flavor' of The Outer Limits remains basically unchanged<br>
from way-back-when in my opinion. Most of the episodes are directed at<br>
providing a graphic and usually (IMO) a simplistic 'truth' about the human<br>
condition.<br>
<p>
During the 70's The Outer limits seemed to trail behind the more<br>
sophisticated story telling of Rod Sirling and crew. But had some good<br>
episodes anyway. Today The Outer Limits seems to trail behind the much more<br>
sophisticated story telling of Chris Carter and crew. But still has some<br>
good episodes anyway. :-)<br>
<p>
Or so it seems to me. :-)<br>
