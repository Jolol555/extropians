<i>&gt; &gt;Personally, as someone who quite often reads mail with 'vi </i><br>
<i>&gt; /var/mail/mark',</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I find HTML a real pain in the ass. The only benefit I can </i><br>
<i>&gt; see is that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;can include links to other sites, but cut and paste takes </i><br>
<i>&gt; far less time</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;than Netscape spends displaying complex HTML messages.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   It looks like many of such problems would be resolved if </i><br>
<i>&gt; you had a smarter</i><br>
<i>&gt; mail server.  You could just tell it what type of client you </i><br>
<i>&gt; use, and it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would filter out HTML code, or do any other conversion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Modems can do such things already, they can talk down to </i><br>

<i>&gt; they talk to</i><br>
<p>
You've missed the rub here.  'Mark' is claiming to read his e-mail by<br>
opening his mail spool directory with the default UNIX text editor. <br>
He is not using a mail client.  The server has no idea (nor should it)<br>
as to which client a user uses.  <br>
<p>
Mail servers accept, deliver, and store messages.  Different types<br>
allow different ways for a client to access and retrieve these<br>
messages (such as IMAP allowing the client to retrieve each part of a<br>
message at any time&lt;headers, body, attachments, etc&gt;).   I can connect<br>
to any of my mail servers with any (almost) client (POP, IMAP, etc). <br>
For a server to be able to keep track of what client you have is for<br>
the server to be able to force you to use a specific client.  And, if<br>
you've told a server you use xyz POP client and then try to retrieve<br>
mail with a 567 IMAP client setup differently (such as keeping mail on<br>
server, deleting mail when exit, where to keep copies of sent mail,<br>
etc) you're shoutta luck.<br>
<p>
While I personally do fine HTML a poor excuse for e-mail format it is<br>
completely within the standards of MIME (which, btw...IS a standard. <br>
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions.  It allows for such things as<br>
sending graphics and audio as attachments to e-mail, as well as WORD<br>
documents or HTML files).  Either Netscape 4.04 or OutLook Express can<br>
read POP, IMAP, HTML, you name it.  There is no excuse for anyone not<br>
being able to read an HTML formatted file.  Wrongful use of bandwidth<br>
perhaps.<br>
<p>
Anyone proud of NOT using a decent mail reader has no sympathy from me<br>
and gives rise to the veracity of their claim to be on a forward<br>
thinking optimistic list.<br>
<p>
What I do find most appalling is the amount of 'I won't believe that<br>
because it's new and you can't make me-proud to be a regressive-we've<br>
always done it this way' sentiment I've seen regarding such a silly<br>
thing as e-mail.  Mark's reading his mailspool with vi is akin to<br>
cutting your lawn with scissors.<br>
