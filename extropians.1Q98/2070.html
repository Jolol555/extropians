  It's so typical for this so-called planning system to start<br>
handling the situation after it has developed into a very<br>
obvious crisis, that I don't even find it funny anymore...<br>
However, this may be very symptomatic - I suggested this very<br>
scenario to my friend yesterday, with the hope that the<br>
quickening progress of technology will destroy justifications<br>
for at least some restrictions on personal liberty.<br>
<p>
Maybe, this is a first step on making highly skilled labor<br>
a globally privileged elite, as the recognition of their<br>
importance, scarcity and exterritorial nature of their work.<br>
(Nature doesn't apply the same territorial restrictions to<br>
tigers and fungi; the governments, so far, have)<br>

 High-tech Firms Seek To End Cap On Foreign Workers<br>
<p>
 By Deeann Glamser<br>
<p>
 SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft and other high-tech companies,<br>
 which say they face a critical shortage of programmers and<br>
 engineers, this week will ask Congress to eliminate the hiring<br>
 cap on foreign professionals.<br>
<p>
 "This has slowly built to a crisis situation this year," Brian<br>
 Raymond, domestic policy manager for the American Electronics<br>
 Association, a trade group representing some 3,000 technology<br>
 companies, said in a recent interview.<br>
<p>
 At issue are H-1B visas, allowing non-citizen doctors, computer<br>
 programmers and other professionals to work in the United States<br>
 for up to six years. The visas are used to fill shortages of<br>
 skilled workers, or are for people with extraordinary talents.<br>
<p>
 This year, the annual limit of 65,000 H-1B visas is expected to<br>
 be hit by June, with no more issued until Oct. 1, the start of<br>
 the next federal fiscal year.<br>
<p>
 Last year, the allotment was gone by September, the first time<br>
 the limit was reached.<br>
<p>
 The Senate Judiciary Committee has a hearing scheduled for<br>
 Wednesday on H-1B visas for high-tech workers.<br>
<p>
 Microsoft, Texas Instruments Inc. and Sun Microsystems officials<br>
 will testify in favor of repealing the cap.<br>
<p>
 The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers-USA, the<br>
<p>
 leading U.S. professional group for electrical and electronics<br>
 engineers, wants to retain the current limit.<br>
<p>
 Visa information is sketchy, but 44 percent of pre- application<br>
 certifications -- the requests companies make to the Labor<br>
 Department as a prerequisite for applying for an H-1B visa -- in<br>
 fiscal 1997 were for computer occupations, up from 25 percent in<br>
 fiscal 1995.<br>
<p>
 The next-largest category in fiscal 1997 was physical therapists,<br>
 at 26 percent of requests.<br>
<p>
 The Information Technology Association of America, a trade<br>
 association that also opposes the cap, says companies with 100 or<br>
 more employees have 346,000 openings for programmers, systems<br>
 analysts and computer engineers, or 10 percent of the nation's<br>
 3.3 million information-technology jobs.<br>
<p>
 Semiconductor maker Texas Instruments hires about 150 H-1B visa<br>
 holders a year, 10 percent to 15 percent of its annual technical<br>
 hires.<br>
<p>
 Most are graduate students at U.S. universities and become<br>
 residents here. The majority are from Taiwan and India.<br>
<p>
 "These employees are critical. We depend greatly on electrical<br>
 engineering talent to build our products," said Stephen Leven,<br>
 Texas Instruments director of worldwide human resources.<br>
<p>
 Intel also wants the cap repealed. It hires 300 to 400 foreign<br>
 design engineers a year, almost a third of the design engineers<br>
 it hires annually and about 4 percent of the slightly more than<br>
 10,000 people it hired in 1997.<br>
<p>
 As at Texas Instruments, most are graduate students sponsored by<br>
 the company for residency.<br>
<p>
 Visa-limit proponents say more U.S. students are enrolling in<br>
 engineering and computer sciences as job prospects surge, and<br>
 older employees can be retrained for the changing job market.<br>
<p>
 "We really believe there is a sufficient amount of people to<br>
 satisfy needs in the U.S.," said Paul Kostek, a Seattle- based<br>
 consultant and president-elect of the Institute of Electrical and<br>
 Electronics Engineers-USA.<br>
<p>
 Norman Matloff, a computer science professor at the University of<br>
 California at Davis, said companies exacerbate the worker<br>
 shortage by requiring very specific skills for each job and<br>
 preferring males in their 20s and 30s.<br>
<p>
 "They want them young, and with the latest, hot technology, "<br>
 Matloff said. "For experienced programmers, learning a new<br>
 language is no big deal."<br>
<p>
 He said visa workers earn less on average than their U.S. peers<br>
 and are unlikely to leave a company sponsoring them for permanent<br>
 residency.<br>
<p>
 Microsoft has not released its H-1B figures, but says a mix of<br>
 cultural backgrounds is critical in a global marketplace.<br>
<p>
 "It's important for us to hire the most appropriate workers to<br>
<p>
 compete," said Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan.<br>
