<i>&gt; I don't know why I'm playing the side of the believer, but it seems like</i><br>
<i>&gt; the underdog is always worth rooting for. Why are you supposedly</i><br>
<i>&gt; open-minded people so into calling it the "Face on Mars" idiocy???</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (sorry if I over generalized)</i><br>
<p>
Well, considering that there are numerous mountains, craters and rock<br>
formations on the earth and moon that look like "faces" quite naturally,<br>
it seems reasonable to assume that the same is the case for the "face"<br>
on Mars. Heard of Occam's Razor?  The extraordinary claim that this<br>
"face" was created by intelligent life requires extraordinary evidence.<br>
Yes, it's possible that it really was made by intelligent life, but why<br>
spend your time pondering one in a billion possibilities? Your mind can<br>
be so open your brain falls out!<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; But it seems that until its proven one way or the other, you should at</i><br>
<i>&gt; least remain open to the possibility that yeah, life MAY have existed</i><br>
<i>&gt; there..  Perhaps its more complex than reducing it to a simple 50-50</i><br>
<i>&gt; chance, but it seems like with any bold new discovery there needs to be an</i><br>
<i>&gt; chance that something extraordinary might be true.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, life may have existed on Mars, but if it did, it most likely did<br>
not evolve further than simple forms. However, there is no conclusive<br>
evidence that any life ever existed on Mars at this point.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I wish that I could put this into better words, it just seems like this</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole thing gets reduced to fiction WAY too quickly. Lets wait to see what</i><br>
<i>&gt; is found before calling it reducing it to the ideas of the deluded.</i><br>
<p>
If conclusive proof is offered that there was indeed an advanced<br>
civilization on Mars, I'll be the first to admit I am wrong. In the<br>
meanwhile, I will bet you any amount you wish (up to $10,000) that this<br>
will not happen in the next year. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; By the way, as much as you'd like to think, our government HAS not been</i><br>
<i>&gt; very straight with us in the past. In fact, our US Government has done some</i><br>
<i>&gt; absolutely heinous things AND covered them up in the name of national</i><br>
<i>&gt; security.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but they were eventually found out. The secret the government had<br>
the biggest interest in keeping was the atomic bomb. However, we now<br>
know that the Russians were getting notes direct from Los Alamos. To<br>
imagine that the government could hide evidence of aliens for decades is<br>
beyond belief.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; deluxe - the delusional mad conspiracy freak! (-:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; and devils advocate.</i><br>
<p>
Nothing wrong with being the devil's advocate. <br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
