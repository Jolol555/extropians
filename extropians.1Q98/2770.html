Forgive an old iconoclast, but would you please format your text in the<br>
ancient, honourable &lt;80 chars tradition? <br>

A slide rule might be faster to gauge the values, vor precision work one<br>
would want to use a calculator. It takes much more effort to learn to<br>
handle a slide rule, and the skills are much more difficult to maintain. <br>

I would be highly irritated, if someone insisted on clogging up my mailbox<br>
with 30 pages of content which is of little relevance to me (above<br>
