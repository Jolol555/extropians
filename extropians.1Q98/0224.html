Well, I think that the number one goal should be working to maximize<br>
individual human freedoms everywhere. Not just censorship here or womens<br>
rights there. I mean, the ACLU, as much as I hate their damliberal<br>
stance of avoiding protecting the 2nd amendment, I do respect greatly<br>
for their willingness to at least fight for the 1st amendment rights of<br>
those who even directly oppose what most ACLU members stand for. We<br>
should take a similar stance, only with regard to ALL political rights.<br>
In the US, I think this means we should publicize the 9th Amendment as<br>
much as possible, as that is what gives the most and broadest power to<br>
the people. I kinda look at the 9th as the Curley of the Bill of Rights.<br>
It never gets the attention or respect it deserves, and its always<br>
getting slapped around by the autocrat, Moe.<br>
<p>
But in general, we should really emphasize that we don't look at rights<br>
as something that can be treated with a buffet style attitude. Take them<br>
all or take none. BY making this the issue, we paint both sides of the<br>
current political spectrum as extremists, and us as the mainstream that<br>
is for maximizing freedom for the most people.<br>
<p>
I think with a general, but firm message like this, we can attract good<br>
PR, support from flighty and often vacuous celebrities (so what its the<br>
message that counts) who can even understand so basic a concept, and<br>
appeal to the broadest range of people. The technological implications<br>
are implicit and can be soft pedalled. We know that it will get here.<br>
What we need to do is prepare the body politic to be receptive to<br>
technology is a way that is not opressive, and to prevent forces from<br>
using technology to yoke mankind firther into slavery.<br>
