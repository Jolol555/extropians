Transportation is too cheap.<br>

When it's really expensive, no one can project power/expect to perform<br>
resource extraction, but no one can colonize effectively, either.  When<br>
it's sorta medium, one can establish a marcher state and develop the<br>
ability to assert sovereignity faster than one can be subjected to control<br>
by someone over yonder performing power projection.  When transportation<br>
is really inexpensive, you can't get far enough away in economic terms to<br>
establish a distinct sovereignity.<br>
