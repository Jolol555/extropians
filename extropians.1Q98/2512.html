You think something is true just because you read it.  It is an expected<br>
value predicted by a statistical formula.  You "guess why they're not<br>
there", and then you refer to this conclusion as "capital fact"?  This<br>
is not a very convincing argument.  Some people could dismiss this as an<br>
unverified claim.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As to what Roe v. Wade legalized, I'll stand by my original post, this is</i><br>

<p>
This is plain wrong.  Abortion laws restrict abortions by trimester. <br>
Please reference a specific law that allows abortion on the due date<br>
while the baby is 2/3 out of the birth canal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; if you live in America, you can legally find a place that will abort your</i><br>
<i>&gt; child on its due date with the child 2/3 out of the birth canal for *any</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason whatsoever*.  Even the doctor who recently testified before Congress</i><br>
<i>&gt; that partial birth abortions were rare and primarily done to protect the</i><br>
<i>&gt; life of the mother, later recanted his testimony out of shame, and admitted</i><br>
<i>&gt; that they were far more prevalent than the orthodox press dared report and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that 90% were elective, i.e., on demand.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, you're talking about the rare situation where you must kill the<br>
mother to save the child, or kill the child to save the mother.  This is<br>
not legal abortion on demand on the due date.  This is a medical<br>
emergency.  You choose to call not killing the mother in favor of the<br>
child a form of abortion.<br>
<p>
If doctors lie and perform this procedure by falsly claiming the<br>
mother's life was in danger, this does not make it a legal procedure in<br>
the U.S.  This would be a criminal act not protected by the law.  The<br>
fact that it happens and is not prosecuted does not make it legal.<br>
<p>
Ninth month abortions are not legal, even though you argue that they<br>
might as well be.  You can't legally find a place that will do this for<br>
you, even if you can easily find such a place with little risk of<br>
prosecution.  Roe vs. Wade did not legalize what you discribe, even if<br>
what you are discribing is actually happening in the same clinics that<br>
are legalized by Roe vs. Wade.<br>
<p>
I respect your right to argue for your viewpoint, but you must realize<br>
that you are exxagerating for effect, and that what you are claiming is<br>
not literally and 100% accurate.  This causes objective observers to<br>
distrust your logical assertions.<br>
