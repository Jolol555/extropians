Marie-Jose:<br>
<i>&gt;Does anyone have an idea of the number of transhumanists worldwide?</i><br>
<p>
I tried to estimate it for a informational paper on transhumanism for <br>
one of my advisors early last year--it turned out to be a lot of <br>
guesswork, partly because FM-2030 pointed out early on that many <br>
transhumans will never identify themselves as such.  In a rough <br>
caculation:  <br>
<p>
(number of Extropians) + (number of people on the other <br>
trasnshumanist list) + (number of people in the MONDO 2000 crowd) + <br>
(number of people who took FM-2030's classes, read his books, <br>
absorbed his ideas and acted on them) + (number of people whose <br>
thinking and actions runs along transhumanist lines but who haven't <br>
hooked up with any of the major groups yet)<br>
<p>
Well, you get the idea!  Any concrete number would have to rely on <br>
self-identification in a self-selected grouping.  To remain <br>
methodologically sound, that should be noted when using any figures.<br>
