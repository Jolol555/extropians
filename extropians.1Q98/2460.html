Michael Bowling said:<br>
<i>&gt;Recall in _Return of the Jedi_ when Luke meets Ben's ghost. Ben says that</i><br>
<i>&gt;Luke's father, Attican (sp?), ceased to exist when he was swayed over to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the dark side. Of Darth Vader, Ben says, "He's more machine than man--</i><br>
<i>&gt;twisted and evil." At the end of _Jedi_, a berserking Luke cuts off</i><br>
<i>&gt;Vader's saber hand, and low!! it is artificial!  Luke looks at his own</i><br>
<i>&gt;prosthetic hand and realizes that he was becoming like his father-- more</i><br>
<i>&gt;machine than man, spiraling enraged into the evil of the Dark Side. ...</i><br>

This is a good point and illustrates that the attitude toward "machinery"<br>
in the Star Wars trilogy is sometimes negative. Yet, two of the major<br>
sympathetic characters are droids - 3PO and R2D2. The movies do not appear<br>
to express a coherent theme.<br>
