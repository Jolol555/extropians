Christopher Fedeli wrote 3/7/98: &lt;I've noticed a strong tendency for all<br>
memetically minded thinkers to keep clinging to some notion of the<br>
metaphysical "I".  How can one accept that all of our traits came to be the<br>
way that they are by the evolution of genes and memes, and yet still think<br>
that somewhere 'in there' is a "me" who is capable of exercising some<br>
control over the process?<br>
<p>
To take a famous example, Richard Dawkins argues that humans can "rebel <br>
against the tyranny of the selfish replicators."  He gives the example that<br>
<p>
every time we use contraception, we are rebelling against the tyranny of<br>
genes who want us to procreate.  But who is really rebelling in this<br>
example?  To me, this seems like an case of the meme for contraception<br>
winning a big victory in the battle for survival against certain genes. <br>
But to hypothesize a magical "self" that lurks around in our brains,<br>
deciding which memes and which genes will exercise influence over our<br>
behaviors at which time is a joke that no reflective thinker could suffer. <br>
        <br>
 <br>
Will anyone argue differently?&gt;<br>
<p>
And Frederick Mann replied 3/7/98: &lt;I agree that there is no magical "self"<br>
or "I" in reality.  However, in the same way that I can load a program<br>
called<br>
"I" into a computer, some complex brain circuitry could evolve and call<br>
itself "I."  And at some point this circuitry could achieve sufficient<br>
complexity to spontaneously produce the epiphenomenon of free will<br>
or volition.&gt;<br>
<p>
I know this seems to be difficult for many individuals to grasp, but there<br>
really is a subjective "I".  Subjectivity is an unpleasant fact of nature<br>
for scientists because there is no way to study it, measure it, experiment<br>
on it, or theorize about it.  So all too many of them take the<br>
intellectually lazy or dippy way out of their conundrum by pretending it<br>
away.  It never works, of course.  Subjectivity is just one of those things<br>
in reality that is a given, there is an "I" that is just as real as<br>
external objects that we can measure.  Free will or volition is not an<br>
epiphenomenon, it is real.  The brain does not work the same way a computer<br>
does in at least one very important respect.  Information does not exist in<br>
the absence of an "I", a knower who is distinct from the known.  "I" can<br>
exchange information with "my" environment, with external objects, with<br>
other subjective selves, even with "my" own body, in that it is an external<br>
object to "me."  However, "I" cannot exchange information with myself, with<br>
"I".  "I" cannot be both subject and object, both knower and known.  When<br>
Socrates said "know thyself," he could only be talking about knowing your<br>
body as it is an object to you and about your relations with other selves<br>
and the external environment.  He could not be talking about knowing your<br>
own self, your "I".  You don't know yourself, you don't exchange<br>
information with yourself, you simply decide.  Decisions are the atmosphere<br>
of subjectivity.  The protection of volitional freedom is of primary<br>
importance because of this.<br>
<p>
Perhaps a consideration that "selfish genes" and "memes" are a load of<br>
hooey is in order if you are forced to pretend that subjectivity isn't<br>
real, or that there is no real "I".  Perhaps some deeper reflection is in<br>
order.<br>
