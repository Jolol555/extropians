Well... I disagree completely... Why to self-limiting ?  The "living being"<br>
comes evoluting, on Earth, since the monocellular, to marine "worms",<br>
fishes, reptiles, {mammalians { monkeys}}, until the actual monocerebrate,<br>
with low vision/audio/smell etc senses, and of course, poor locomotive<br>
capabilities homo "sapiens" ... This hominide, for his turn, has already<br>
created other evolutive capabilities in the world around, like cars,<br>
aeroplanes, computers, nanorobots etc., and since some centuries ago,<br>
begins to perceive that he can add  such evolution to his own being... Like<br>
an Icarus well-succeeded... And I am not talking just about hardware, but,<br>
mainly, about software... Our minds are, truly speaking, ridiculously<br>
simple in comparison to its own imagination... or to its<br>
creation/realization capability... There is no real barrier to our infinite<br>
evolution, except ignorance, fear, shiness, wrong traditions, religions and<br>
cultural influences wich we must trash out... (note: do not thash out<br>
fraternity, charity etc... but use more mature kinds of them..) We will<br>
simply have unlimited  self-transformative possibilities... The complete<br>
understanding of our whole being, not just the mind, will simply make<br>
possible the complete self-redesign of our own existence on any aspects one<br>
can think, and at any instant one can desire... and of the whole universe...<br>
<p>
And...: Do not believe in all the populars say around... Or so you do not<br>
respect those who are in the high top of knowledge creation/development...<br>
