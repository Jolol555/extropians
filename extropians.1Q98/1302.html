<i>&gt; It depends on the forum.  If it were a civil case, the burden on the</i><br>

<p>
Entrapment is a criminal defense. Where in U.S. civil law do you find<br>
such a thing?<br>
<p>
"Preponderance of the evidence" is merely the burden of persuasion on<br>
Clinton to establish the entrapment defense. This matters only insofar<br>
as a jury instruction will issue concerning entrapment when the burden<br>
is met. The prosecution must rebut. <br>
<p>
Note that the prosecution (nearly) always has to prove its case beyond a<br>
reasonable doubt. The defense need not assert its defenses beyond a<br>
reasonable doubt. Sometimes merely "some evidence" suffices to switch<br>
the burden of proof to the prosecution (this varies). Usually, the<br>
defense must assert its defenses by a "preponderance of the evidence."<br>
<p>
Caveat:<br>
<p>
I'm talking only about *affirmative defenses* which are issues raised<br>
first by the defense and which tend to prove the defendant's innocence.<br>
Such defenses include insanity, entrapment, self-defense, etc. This does<br>
not affect the fact that rebuttal of prosecutorial evidence need only<br>
establish a reasonable doubt.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In a criminal case, the burden on the prosecution is "beyond a</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonable doubt" so Clinton's defense merely needs to establish and</i><br>
<i>&gt; sustain a reasonable doubt.</i><br>
<p>
Don't conflate "defense" with "affirmative defense." The former is a<br>
procedural event in which the defendant presents his case. The latter is<br>
a particular issue raised first by the defense (and answered by the<br>
prosecution) that tends to prove the defendants innocence.<br>
<p>
Depending on what Clinton's "defense" is doing at a particular moment,<br>
the burden of persuasion varies. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  There is ***NO*** possibility that "they</i><br>
<i>&gt; were investigating me, I had to have her lie to defend myself" would</i><br>
<i>&gt; establish a reasonable doubt of anything except perhaps his sanity;</i><br>
<i>&gt; as far as the actual charges, it would be taken as a confession</i><br>
<i>&gt; without remorse.</i><br>
<p>
"[E]ven if the defendant denies one or more elements of the crime, he is<br>
entitled to an entrapment instruction whenever there is sufficient<br>
evidence from which a reasonable jury could find entrapment."_Mathews v.<br>
U.S._ 485 U.S. 58, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988) (Rhenquist, C.J.)<br>
<p>
MY NOTE: This means that a defendant can deny that he committed the<br>
crime, and then claim that the reason he committed it was because he was<br>
entrapped. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In an IMPEACHMENT case, the burden on the prosecution is to establish</i><br>
<i>&gt; the case well enough that a set percentage of Congress has to buy it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  There is no standard specified by which each individual member of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Congress is supposed to decide if he/she buys it.</i><br>
<p>
I'm talking only about criminal trials here. You're free to argue that a<br>
President convicted of obstruction would not be impeached. I would<br>
suggest without any evidence at all to back me up that even a Democratic<br>
Congress would be hard-pressed to find a reason to keep a convict in<br>
office. I may be wrong. <br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Me, I want Clinton to lose a lot of credibility but NOT be impeached</i><br>
<i>&gt; or resign.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because I don't believe that Vice President Gore can win the White</i><br>
<i>&gt; House; but President Gore might win re-election.</i><br>
