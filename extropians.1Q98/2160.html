I missed the first 20 minutes of it, but watched it until the end.<br>

<p>
I agree that it does show many negative things about uploading, though<br>
the cryonics/life extension stuff was not really attacked directly in the<br>
movie.<br>
<p>
My biggest complaint was that the acting was awful.  The protagonist<br>
was too wooden.  His wife and son were almost nonentities.  That<br>
could have used some polish, as well as some of the dialogu...  To<br>
be sure, it was a made for tv movie.<br>
<p>
Anyway, it is good to see the ideas taken seriously in a prime time<br>
movie.  Now we can go out there and start a wider discussion of<br>
the issues.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
