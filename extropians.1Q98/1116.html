This is technically true.  It made me think of a great meme-generating<br>
political machine.  I do not claim this is true, because imagine this<br>
possible scenario:  The Whitewater team leaks the details about the tapes,<br>
calls a press conference, and indicates that a deposition will occur the<br>
next day.  All the news organizations send their top people and start<br>
scheduling news specials to cover the events.  When all the news people<br>
show up for the press conference, they are told that it was a mistake and<br>
that there would be no news.  The deposition is postponed indefinitely.<br>
Now the news media have nothing official to put in all their news specials<br>
which they have already announced and schedules.  So now, all the networks<br>
are having hour long specials with no real news, just rehashing old<br>
scandals and speculating on the new one with no real information.<br>
<p>
Again, I'm not claiming this was intentional.  But, it makes me consider<br>
the possibility of leading the media to schedule news shows without facts,<br>
and then leaving them without evidence so they have nothing to present but<br>
allegations, so they present that.  The idea of this occurring is a good<br>
lesson in meme-spreading.  This latest allegation is much more important<br>
and believed by the public than any of the previous scandals, even though<br>
previous allegations have had much more proof than anything we have yet<br>
heard about this one.  It seems that the way it was presented is more<br>
important to meme-infection than the actual content.  The amount of<br>
coverage it receives in the news media makes it seem more factual than any<br>
real evidence.<br>
