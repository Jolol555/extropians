<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;     There is no doubt in my mind that most people would drop whatever they are doing</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; their spouse or sibling or parent or offspring if they were one of those starving</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; statistics.  Most people would think it strange (irresponsible even) if I mentioned</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; that my wife was "...dying in some Ethopian hell-hole. Darn those Warlords, it's their</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; bet Ethiopia would be hip-deep in Marines if Hillary C. was lost somewhere in-country.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That is the point. Since nobody we know is stuck there, and we didn't have anything to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with creating the situation, its none of my business at this point.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches me that one day I may need some unknown person's</i><br>
<i>&gt; help. Besides with the technology and power which will soon be available to the average postal</i><br>
<i>&gt; worker ;-) wouldn't we all stand a better chance of living if 100% of the world was looking out</i><br>
<i>&gt; for our survival vs some lesser amount?.    I wonder if a study (game theory) was done to see</i><br>
<i>&gt; which attitude was more benefical to survival?</i><br>
<p>
Ever hear of the saying, "No good deed goes unpunished."?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; If the people there want my help, they should a) ask for it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sometimes they are unable or not allowed or just ignorant.</i><br>
<p>
A man cannot be freed by someone else, he must free himself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; b) have something to offer in return for my help,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You would get at least that person's undying love, admiration, and respect (and mine too).</i><br>
<p>
In the chinese language, there are supposedly a couple dozen words to describe varying levels of<br>
gratitude. In the ideograms for each one contains symbols that also imply varying levels of<br>
resentment.<br>
<p>
"I swear by my life and my love of life that I will nor live for the sake of another man, nor ask<br>
that he live for mine."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Instead, these people refuse our help until things are royally screwed up, and then beg for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; our help. When we come in and perform political/economic triage to fix things, they start</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; protesting, bombing, and demanding we leave. Seems too many people don't like the saying</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Be careful what you ask for, you might get it".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree. People who are screwed  up, usually don't change their behavior.</i><br>
<p>
Then what the hell is your point? I'll be damned if I'm gonna help anyone who isn't willing to help<br>
themselves. You're writing a prescription for welfare codependency here.<br>
<p>
To quote Mr. Jim Peron of Johannesburg:<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I received your email regarding hunger in Africa. I think I'm the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; person on the list actually living in Africa so I would like to</i><br>
<i>&gt; contribute something.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Donations of food or money will do almost nothing to alleviate hunger in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Africa. The problems are not problems of production or distribution but</i><br>
<i>&gt; politics. Ethiopia is one of the richest nations in the world in</i><br>
<i>&gt; agricultural terms. Yet the famine there was political induced. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Marxist regime confiscated food and used it in areas where they had</i><br>
<i>&gt; support. The food was confiscated from areas which didn't support the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Marxists. And it was in these areas that people starved. Food aid sent</i><br>
<i>&gt; to Ethiopia was, to a very large degree, off loaded in the capital and</i><br>
<i>&gt; used by the government.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In Zimbabwe the Marxist regime of Mugabe is now confiscating the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; productive farms in the country simply on the basis of the race of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; owners. These farms, each of which feed thousands, will be turned into</i><br>
<i>&gt; small subsistance plots feeding only a fraction of that number.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; African governments are fond of requiring farmers to sell all their</i><br>
<i>&gt; crops to the governmment at super low prices (in the name of feeding the</i><br>
<i>&gt; people). The food is then resold on the world market at the higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; market prices and the profit kept in Swiss bank accounts of the petty</i><br>
<i>&gt; dictators who run the country.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In other countries where the governments are slightly less authoritarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; and corrupt food aid does get distributed. The result of all this free</i><br>
<i>&gt; food is that local farmers are put out of business. The only way they</i><br>
<i>&gt; can stay in business is selling their products at a profit which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible when their competition is free food. Decades of aid have</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroyed local farming.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Get it through your head that it isn't something we can do anything about unless the people of<br>
those countries rise up and get rid of the hoodlums in charge who purposefully create these<br>
situations. Hunger in Africa is not about droughts and starving innocent people, its about tyrants<br>
using well meaning liberal morons as puppets to extort money out of westerners through guilt, while<br>
at the same time violating the laws of war to fight internal insurgencies.<br>
