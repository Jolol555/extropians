Yeah, that's right, I can't read. You got my number. In fact, I have a<br>
team of monkeys here randomly hitting keys, hopefully, I will get an<br>
email message out soon. Or maybe they will finish Hamlet for me soon. <br>
<p>
I have met many Secular Humanists and not one of them was using it as a<br>
euphemism! That proves it, I'm right, you're wrong! Actually, that would<br>
be a silly way to go about it. I was just pointing out that your comment<br>
was not a fair way to characterize humanism. You should try some<br>
scientific method which does not allow one to use such "personal" off<br>
the cuff observations as evidence to support claims. Have you ever heard<br>
of the science method? Of course you have. Just as I can read. I was not<br>
jumping on your back, why did you feel it necessary to stomp on mine?<br>
You just were making it sound like Secular Humanism was philosophically<br>
a "weak straw man" which is identical to atheism. This would not be a be<br>
a far criticism. It is like then people characterize transhumanism as<br>
science fiction that is confused about reality. <br>
<p>
Also, I just wondering what this meant:<br>
<p>
(I only went through this exercise because you countered an<br>
<i>&gt; earlier post of someone else's by not responding to his actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; content but to what you thought you read.)</i><br>
<p>
What did I counter wrong? Maybe I did, but what are you talking about?<br>
If I did, I am sorry to whomever I did that too. I try not to post items<br>
to newsgroups if I do not understand the topic.<br>
