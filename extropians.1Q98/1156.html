Sarcasm will get you nowhere.<br>

What keeps me going, which I assume is what's forced you to rise to this<br>
heights of biting wit, is the prevalent assumption around these parts<br>
that not-black == white, at least in economic terms.  (Gee, if it isn't<br>
pure market capitalism it MUST be Stalinism!) Ignoring fine distinctions<br>
such as free trade based on barter [direct exchange of goods] or money<br>
[an indirection layer for goods and services] or other systems [LETS?],<br>
it assumes that any market system is always good, and any non-market<br>
system is always coercive and, of necessity, bad. Which makes about as<br>
much sense as declaring that families are evil because they are<br>
tantamount to a communist dictatorship; after all, in an old-fashioned<br>
nuclear family there tends to be a coercive relationship between parents<br>
and children, there may well be a degree of economic dependency enforced<br>
by law or custom between the adults, and they hold property collectively.<br>
<p>
I guess I just don't like the way that people who claim to be committed<br>
to dynamic optimism seem to be so afraid of the bogey-man. Massive<br>
exercises in irrational behaviour tend to reap the seeds they sowed<br>
to begin with.<br>
