I'm not sure why you think we have circumvented the main point.  Not only<br>
did we answer, but you summarized our answers pretty well.  You even givr<br>
explainations for our answers.  I'm not sure how we could make our answers<br>
any more clear.  We don't want anyone scanning us against our will.  Doing<br>
anything to us against our will is a threat to our freedom.<br>
<p>
You seem to propose a voluntary system where each person can choose whether<br>
to be scanned or not.  But when we choose an answer different than yours,<br>
you suggest that our answers are less valid and that everyone should choose<br>
the same answer.  This does not sound like an argument for a voluntary<br>
system of personal choice.<br>
