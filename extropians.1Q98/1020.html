 <br>
That's interesting: I don't remember writing any of that. In fact,<br>
looking back at my earlier poster, I said: "I seem to recall a recent<br>
statement by the RAC (here in the UK) that diabetic hypoglycaemia is a<br>
not-too-uncommon cause of auto accidents." That's a fair way -- in<br>
quantitative terms -- from saying "untreated diabetes caused lots of<br>
road accidents." The same goes for your other quotes: they're distortions<br>
of what I said.<br>
<p>
Please don't put words into my mouth. I'll try to substantiate my own<br>
utterances, if you want to make targets of them, but I'm not going to<br>
stand behind a straw man.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;What I was going on about is the problem that there's a conflict of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;interest between people selling health care insurance and people buying </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;it, and this conflict of interests may be a side-effect of the market</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;system itself. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but there's always a conflict of interest between people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; want more money than they have, and people who don't want to pay.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't see how this can ever be avoided.</i><br>
 <br>
You seem to be locked into a fairly narrow way of understanding <br>
human relationships, then.<br>
<p>
Look: I don't want to get bogged down in a discussion of the minutiae<br>
of healthcare economics in 1990's USA/UK or wherever. What I'm commenting<br>
on is, in a nutshell, the perception that the market is the _best_<br>
way of handling resource allocation disputes. It's NOT proven to be<br>
the _best_ way, it's just the * best _known_ way *. It has defects<br>
which, in some circumstances, render it unworkable without external<br>
regulation. Unless you consider industrial feudalism to be a valid<br>
and desirable extropian future -- I don't, I'd prefer a system that<br>
lets _everyone_ realise their maximum potential -- this means that<br>
it's not the final answer.<br>
<p>
I look around the extropians list and I see people -- same as it was<br>
in 1992 -- with their eyes fixed on the stars, but their whole idea<br>
of economic interaction is based on an uncritical acceptance of <br>
dogma inherited from the 1920's (and formulated to some extent as a<br>
backlash against the then-dire threat of Soviet collectivism). This<br>
is a weird paradox: forward-thinkers who _refuse_ to examine some<br>
of their assumptions and try to improve on them.<br>
<p>
I dunno. The free market _may_ be the optimal mediational method, for<br>
all I know;  but what I see here isn't people trying to _prove_ it,<br>
or, alternatively, trying to invent something better: what I see <br>
is people taking it as a forgone conclusion.<br>
<p>
This is a blind spot. You have been notified.<br>
