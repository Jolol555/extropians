Follows is a snip of conversation Anders and I were having regarding the<br>
possibility of creating a demo or program to help us simulate and play<br>
out various scenarios:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (hmm, maybe one could even have a small applet that demonstrates the</i><br>
<i>&gt; effects of the parameters).</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anders</i><br>
<p>
[[That could be very interesting.  I would love to see a full-blown<br>
simulation<br>
game (similar to the war games played on supercomputers by the USSR and<br>
USA)<br>
online where different parties could play together and/or against each<br>
other<br>
on all varieties of nanotech scenarios.  As thousands of games are<br>
played out<br>
we might begin to gain a fuller understanding of the most likely<br>
scenarios to<br>
develop.  In fact, I'm surprised that the Foresight Institute, now<br>
moving<br>
beyond the mere propagation of nanotech, hasn't come up with such a<br>
program.<br>
Since the Institute is always looking for money, you would think they<br>
would<br>
hook up with Maxis to develop an in-depth "Sim-Nano".<br>

<p>
Does anybody on the list have the necessary skills or time to develop a<br>
Demo?  Until then, I don't think we are ever going to reach any kind of<br>
consensus of what are the most likely scenarios given certain intial<br>
conditions and parameters of play.<br>
