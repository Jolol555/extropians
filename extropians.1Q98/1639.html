<i>&gt; I'm not completely sure how emotional readiness is founded in biology,</i><br>

<p>
Not necessarily. One can do useful psychology by just discussing (say)<br>
"Do these persons like the mental states they find themselves in?" and<br>
similar questions. You are right in that a very large amount of work<br>
has gone into studying non-normal psychology, especially since most of<br>
the non-normal mental states are distressing to be in (and to some<br>
extend distressing to others). There is a much smaller subset of work<br>
dealing with positive mental states, without necessarily defining<br>
"normal == good" (e.g. Csíkszentmihályi's work on flow, which is<br>
rather different from the usual mental states we have).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is based</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the very same social biases that cause the problems it tries to</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand.  We then use therapy to try and solve these problems, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; never in this process to we question "normal."  It is merely based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; social trends and has no grounding in scientific fact.  So if my</i><br>
<i>&gt; comments are unfounded in psychology, it's because psychology is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; product of the problem.</i><br>
<p>
The problem seems to be that since normal in most cases is a rather<br>
good mental state to be in compared to the alternatives (with a bias<br>
since psychologists are much more likely to meet depressed patients<br>
than self-reliant happy people with no need for help) that it forgets<br>
that it would concentrate on optimization of mental states instead of<br>
just normalizing them.<br>
