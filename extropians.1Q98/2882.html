If you are referring to the telomere mediated mechanism of cell death then<br>
there appears to be disagreement in the scientific community. Below are<br>
two relevant excerpts from the New York Times: <br>
<p>
January 20, 1998<br>
Cell Rejuvenation May Yield Medical Advances<br>
by Nicholas Wade<br>
<p>
begin excerpt:<br>
<p>
Third, the aging of cells in the test tube is not necessarily the same as<br>
the aging of tissues in the body. Do people in fact die because their cells<br>
run out of telomeres? <br>
<p>
"If it is true that our life span is dictated by telomere shortening, then<br>
you would imagine that some humans die because their critical cells run out<br>
of telomeres, and there is no evidence for that at all," said Dr. Robert<br>
Weinberg, of the Whitehead Institute, in Boston. "It is plausible that the<br>
telomeres are long enough to allow all of us to live to 200." <br>
<p>
end excerpt<br>
<p>
January 18, 1998<br>
Longevity's New Lease on Life<br>
by Nicholas Wade<br>
<p>
begin excerpt<br>
<p>
Turning on telomerase permanently would sabotage a vital defense against<br>
cancer cells. But perhaps the gene could be flicked on just long enough to<br>
rebuild telomeres. Would this postpone aging? <br>
<p>
No one knows for sure. Cells in a test tube and people may age differently.<br>
And the body is composed of two main classes of cells, those that never<br>
divide after the fetus matures and those that divide a lot. The dividing<br>
cells are those of tissues and fluids that get a lot of wear and tear, like<br>
the skin, blood and stomach lining. <br>
<p>
Scientists are divided on whether these wear-and-tear tissues give out for<br>
lack of long telomeres. If they do, then rejuvenation might help. <br>
<p>
But many other cells don't divide at all during adult life, including the<br>
neurons of the brain. No one knows what governs the aging of these cells.<br>
Turning on telomerase "is not going to take care of your Alzheimer's,<br>
skeleton atrophy and cataracts, so it can't address all aspects of aging,"<br>
said Dr. George M. Martin, an expert on aging at the University of<br>
Washington in Seattle. <br>
