Well, if you include Panama, then you are merely creating a combo of his two<br>
nicknames: KING, and PELVIS. Of course, this is ignoring Bosnia-Herzegovina,<br>
Croatia, and Saudi Arabia (the S is, I imagine, for Somalia), as well as Haiti.<br>
<p>
This sort of crap is the same sort of junk as the claim that BILL GATES III in<br>
ascii equals 666. It doesn't, since the "III" is not three ones, but three "I"'s,<br>
and just the sort of illogical off topic sniping liberals start spouting when<br>
they know they are full of it, and realize that everyone else knows they are full<br>
of it.<br>
