Re this: what's the Idea Futures URL? I have a naughty bit of culture<br>
jamming I want to post. It's a pool on the date that Chelsea takes her<br>
first puff of marijuana while she's at Stanford. Hmm, I bet she inhales.<br>
<p>
:)<br>
<p>
No, I have nothing against Chelsea _or_ her probably inevitable<br>
experimentation.<br>
<p>
Yes, hypocrisy needs to be drawn up short when its practitioners have a<br>
monopoly on the _soi-disant_ "legitimate use of force".<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; beliefs.  Thus, it does not require adherence to any</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; _antisexual_ moral code to see this as a character flaw.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Why are Bill and/or Hillary obligated to tell us the truth about their</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; private sexual lives? If they want to put on some charade for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; public, what of it? Someone once said that hypocrisy is the tribute</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; vice</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; pays to virtue. My personal opinion is that the Clintons should just</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; respond to any questions of a sexual nature with "That's none of your</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; business."</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Mark Fulwiler</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm sorry, but I have to laugh when I hear the "none of your business"</i><br>
<i>&gt;or "wait until he is proven guilty of a crime" stuff trotted out to</i><br>
<i>&gt;defend Clinton.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe if he and his wife (and all the other politicians) left me alone,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'd reciprocate.  But here's a guy who thinks nothing of backing drug</i><br>
<i>&gt;forfeiture laws which seize an individual's property without even</i><br>
<i>&gt;charging the person with a crime!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Who has his drug czar threaten doctors who might prescribe marijuanna to</i><br>
<i>&gt;their patients, even after the general public agrees in vote that they</i><br>
<i>&gt;want more health freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'd love for Bill and Hillary to get to say "None of your business" when</i><br>
<i>&gt;it comes to their personal life, but dang it they keep bringing 'round a</i><br>
<i>&gt;village to run my life...from raising my kids to nationalizing my health</i><br>
<i>&gt;care.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Here's a pair who've proposed to punish us if we attempt to get better</i><br>
<i>&gt;or even different medical care than our neighbors, (e.g., by spending</i><br>
<i>&gt;your own money for a covered operation), both you and your doctor will</i><br>
<i>&gt;be committing a federal crime.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Who favor Federal health-care police authorized to enter your home</i><br>
<i>&gt;without search warrants for "indoor air-quality inspections" and "well</i><br>
<i>&gt;baby" visits. If they decide you have an "unhealthy" home</i><br>
<i>&gt;environment, existing child-abuse laws authorize them to immediately</i><br>
<i>&gt;take away your children.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Their "Comprehensive School Health Education" initiatives authorize the</i><br>
<i>&gt;government to shape</i><br>
<i>&gt;your children's behavior involving "Tobacco use; alcohol and other drug</i><br>
<i>&gt;abuse; sexual behaviors ... ;</i><br>
<i>&gt;behaviors resulting in intentional and unintentional injuries; dietary</i><br>
<i>&gt;patterns resulting in disease; and</i><br>
<i>&gt;sedentary life styles . . ." [HSA, pp. 607-608]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Under Clinton's plan, your doctor would be forced to turn over all of</i><br>
<i>&gt;your medical information to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;federal computer center. Your children would be registered with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;state from birth. If your doctor</i><br>
<i>&gt;withholds any information, he can be fined $10,000 per violation,</i><br>
<i>&gt;without trial. [HSA, p. 871]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And Bill want us all to carry to carry a government-issued Health</i><br>
<i>&gt;Security Card which could hold up to 1,600 pages of information about</i><br>
<i>&gt;you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your mandatory ID card and government health files will make nearly</i><br>
<i>&gt;every detail of your life an</i><br>
<i>&gt;open book to millions of bureaucrats, IRS agents, and police officers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Once they run your card</i><br>
<i>&gt;through a scanner, they'll know everything you've ever written on a</i><br>
<i>&gt;medical form or told your doctor:</i><br>
<i>&gt;your address, phone number, employer, drug history, every physical and</i><br>
<i>&gt;mental disorder,</i><br>
<i>&gt;pregnancies and abortions -- and even you doctor's personal notes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Clinton's plan creates 105 new government agencies, and greatly expands</i><br>
<i>&gt;the power of 42 others. Hundreds of thousands of bureaucrats will</i><br>
<i>&gt;monitor you and your doctor, reeducate your children, and enter your</i><br>
<i>&gt;office and home at will.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yeah, poor Bill Clinton, let's stay out of his private life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                                                Pat</i><br>
