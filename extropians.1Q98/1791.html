Human capital markets are (if I understand what you mean) possibly in<br>
resurgence.<br>
<p>
I'm really enthusiastic about the idea. Grameen Banks could be set up in<br>
other parts of the word--Peru? Chiapas?<br>
<p>
Currently, I'm facing the following problem:<br>
Problem is that it can look like indenturement and indenturement can look<br>
like slavery.<br>
<p>
Let's talk more about this.<br>

<i>&gt;everyone better off, it could also increase the inequality of wealth in</i><br>
<i>&gt;society. One reason the level of inequality in our society now is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;higher is that the government subsides and forces self-investment in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;form of education, and the market does not allow people to sell off that</i><br>
<i>&gt;investment. If people are able to sell their human capital, then some</i><br>

<i>&gt;efficient human capital market would allow them to do it to a much greater</i><br>
<i>&gt;extent.)</i><br>

<i>&gt;One reason extropians might be interested in the development of a human</i><br>
<i>&gt;capital market, besides that it give people choices they didn’t have</i><br>
<i>&gt;before, is that it may allow greater investment in human capital in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;scenario where this is especially risky. For example, suppose people</i><br>
<i>&gt;expect that there is an even chance of cheap AIs developing in the next</i><br>
<i>&gt;ten years. If that happens they will lose a lot of their income potential</i><br>
<i>&gt;as the AIs compete with humans in the labor market. If a human capital</i><br>
<i>&gt;market did not exist, this would lead people to substantially reduce</i><br>
<i>&gt;education and other forms of human capital investment in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt;diversify into (say) AI company stocks or physical resources. A human</i><br>
<i>&gt;capital market would allow the level of human capital investment to stay</i><br>
<i>&gt;at more efficient levels (although it would still be lower than if there</i><br>
<i>&gt;was no chance of AIs developing).</i><br>
