<i>&gt;Great post!  I wanna come too!</i><br>
<p>
Thanks for the sentiment. 'Course, those are easy words to say from clear<br>
the hell on the other side of the world. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Of course, here in Australia, that's the *standard* use of `mate' - which</i><br>
<i>&gt;might, if we can wake the sun-drenched buggers up, might make Aussies the</i><br>
<i>&gt;perfect launchpad for transhumanism... [`buggers' is another standard use,</i><br>
<i>&gt;with very little connection to the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras even now</i><br>
<i>&gt;winding flamboyantly though the streets of Sydney - but then again...]</i><br>
<p>
Umm... "mate" I'll take, I guess. "Buggers," I'll probably have to pass on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When I was 15 and 16, I lived in a monastery (I was planning to become a</i><br>
<i>&gt;Catholic priest).  I was glad to return to the outside world, but there</i><br>
<i>&gt;really was a genuine win-win, meditative quality in that life which I think</i><br>
<i>&gt;the busy-busy world could learn from.  Pretty quickly I moved into one of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the earliest of the urban campus communes in Australia (in the mid-60s),</i><br>
<i>&gt;and for years after that lived, on and off, in such households.</i><br>
<p>
My first time was in the Army. Ralph Whelan and I were barracks roommates,<br>
and I found that really valuable when I started shifting toward extropian<br>
ideas (and away from the mainstream). The combining of the resources was<br>
something I valued right at the beginning. I didn't start getting the love<br>
and other fuzzy stuff until later.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;They fell</i><br>
<i>&gt;apart when couples had kids, went professional, got jealous over sexual and</i><br>
<i>&gt;affection issues.  For years now I've lived alone, despite periodic</i><br>
<i>&gt;entanglements.</i><br>
<p>
I lived with Ralph and Tanya for about 3 years before spending a year away<br>
from the nexus with a girlfriend. She was definitely worth moving out for,<br>
and I'm glad I spent that time, but ultimately I knew I was better off in<br>
the nexus, without kids (a big problem for me -- I'm a less than stellar<br>
step-father). And there is certainly the possibility that another similar<br>
relationship will come along and get me to do the same thing (leave). But<br>
I'm not really expecting that right now. I'd much prefer the new person to<br>
be someone who joins rather than someone who takes me away. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It has very many merits - but ah, those head rubs...!</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Damien sobs quietly for a moment.)</i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry to have made you sob. I guess you're an effective salesman when,<br>
after you've finished with your sales pitch, your customer is crying because<br>
he doesn't yet own what your selling.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Thanks for the terrific post, Derek.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
You're welcome.  Glad someone enjoyed it.<br>
<p>
Best wishes,<br>
<p>
