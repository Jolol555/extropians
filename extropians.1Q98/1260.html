<i>&gt; Interesting story! Checking out your site now. A question for you - How do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you think your technology would have fared in a market without any gov't</i><br>
<i>&gt; subsidies? Why wouldn't the short-sight human nature to buy cheapest now,</i><br>
<i>&gt; instead of cheapest long-term been even more strongly expressed?</i><br>
<p>
Considering that in areas where there were no subsidies, all it took was<br>
forward thinking building owners (Boeing, for example, even though Seattle City<br>
Light &amp; Power had run out of funding for the year, bought 1000 kits from us in<br>
one order.) to make a sale. Usually building owners who are in the money<br>
/finance business immediately saw that we were a great deal. I had a bank in<br>
Texas that wanted to finance any customer of ours who wanted the kits, sight<br>
unseen. Basically, our cost of conservation was less than 0.5 cents per<br>
kilowatt hour saved, so not only were we the cheapest 'source' of power around,<br>
but also 1/3 that of the average government run conservation program which<br>
averaged around 1.5 cents per kwh saved.<br>
<p>
We also fared better in the few areas where rebates were proportional to the<br>
energy saved.<br>
<p>
Before I had this business, I was a Republican through and through. You can now<br>
see why I'm a libertarian. There is absolutely no idea or ideal in the world<br>
that is so great that it can't be FUBARed by a government program.<br>
