 Why do you expect that there is some way of handling scarce resources<br>
that is fundamentally different from what has already been tried?<br>
 I see plenty of room for innovation in taking things out of the<br>
realm of scarce resources (e.g. medical care could be done by freeware<br>
for our molecular assemblers eventually). But I think the laws of<br>
physics appear to require that some things be in limited supply, and<br>
my desire to experiment with Jupiter sized brains will probably be<br>
sufficient to keep the demand unlimited.<br>
 It appears to me that any commons suffers from the well-known tragedy<br>
unless there are restrictions on its use, and that any such restriction<br>
would fall under my concept of a property right. We seem to have tried<br>
enough variations on the concept of property rights (individual vs.<br>
communal, bundled vs. things like mineral rights) that we are ready<br>
to draw general conclusions about how they work.<br>

<p>
 I find it ironic that you make this claim at the same time that<br>
Netscape is announcing it will make its browser source code public.<br>
I've just seen a report that all of Netscape's top people read and<br>
were influenced by a paper written by a former member of this list at<br>
<a href="http://www.ccil.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-paper.html">http://www.ccil.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-paper.html</a>.<br>

<i>&gt;I dunno. The free market _may_ be the optimal mediational method, for</i><br>

<p>
 Well, the list charter does discourage rehashing certain basics that<br>
most of us consider already as proven as they can be. Especially when<br>
most attempts at questioning whether it's a forgone conclusion just<br>
repeat the same old ideas.<br>
