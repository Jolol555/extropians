Jim:<br>
<p>
Not word games, not "my need for an argument"--real philosophy that you may<br>
not have considered thoroughly. Sorry to have been perceived that way. <br>
<p>
OK, I'll go for a counterexample--bear with me, here, and I'll avoid any<br>
trace of irony. You have my word.<br>
<p>
Do you know what a "Rattleback" is? It's a kid's toy. Edmund's sells them,<br>
you can get them at the Exploratorium gift shop, etc.<br>
<p>
It is based on (fundamentally identical to) the shape of certain water-worn<br>
stones. It has the curious physical property that when you set it on a flat<br>
surface, it has a preferred direction of spin.<br>
<p>
Nature did the work of shaping the stones. Humans noticed the curious<br>
behavior.<br>
<p>
OK, now you tell me: 1) Who designed the rattleback toy? 2) Where did the<br>
design come from?<br>
<p>
One counterexample is all it takes. :) I believe this shows that a blind<br>
watchmaker still makes watches. Please poke substantive holes in this<br>
reasoning--if you do so, you will help me to learn to think better.<br>

No, you miss my point--I have a high level list of things I want my body to<br>
be able to do. I lack the technology to implement my design--but that<br>
doesn't mean I'm not doing design.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Oh. I see. You think anyone who uses the word "design" to refer to</i><br>

<i>&gt;using your new definition.</i><br>
<p>
No, see above. The question of where design comes from really matters to<br>
me. I avoid cheap thinking on the subject. I should probably have prefixed<br>
my comments with (po), but you may not know what that word means either. :)<br>
<p>
Peace, Jim: I was playing, but seriously--sorry if my litany was<br>
interpreted as me ragging on you.<br>
