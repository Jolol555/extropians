Dear Mark:<br>
<p>
I received your email regarding hunger in Africa. I think I'm the only<br>
person on the list actually living in Africa so I would like to<br>
contribute something.<br>
<p>
Donations of food or money will do almost nothing to alleviate hunger in<br>
Africa. The problems are not problems of production or distribution but<br>
politics. Ethiopia is one of the richest nations in the world in<br>
agricultural terms. Yet the famine there was political induced. The<br>
Marxist regime confiscated food and used it in areas where they had<br>
support. The food was confiscated from areas which didn't support the<br>
Marxists. And it was in these areas that people starved. Food aid sent<br>
to Ethiopia was, to a very large degree, off loaded in the capital and<br>
used by the government.<br>
<p>
In Zimbabwe the Marxist regime of Mugabe is now confiscating the most<br>
productive farms in the country simply on the basis of the race of the<br>
owners. These farms, each of which feed thousands, will be turned into<br>
small subsistance plots feeding only a fraction of that number.<br>
<p>
African governments are fond of requiring farmers to sell all their<br>
crops to the governmment at super low prices (in the name of feeding the<br>
people). The food is then resold on the world market at the higher<br>
market prices and the profit kept in Swiss bank accounts of the petty<br>
dictators who run the country.<br>
<p>
In other countries where the governments are slightly less authoritarian<br>
and corrupt food aid does get distributed. The result of all this free<br>
food is that local farmers are put out of business. The only way they<br>
can stay in business is selling their products at a profit which is<br>
impossible when their competition is free food. Decades of aid have<br>
destroyed local farming.<br>
<p>
In the 50s Africa exported food to the rest of the world. In the 60s it<br>
was self-sufficient. By the 70s everything had gone to hell. If you read<br>
my chapter "The Shambles of Africa" in my book Exploding Population<br>
Myths I explain some of the reasons why this happened. Another<br>
worthwhile book is George Ayittey's Africa Betrayed. George is Ghanian<br>
economist worth reading.<br>
<p>
And given the policies they are promoting now in South Africa I predict<br>
a general decline in food production here as well. It will take some<br>
time to s how up but everything is in place to destroy local productive<br>
farming.<br>
