&lt;&lt; Isn't it blindingly obvious that any major advance in energy production,<br>
 which would instantly make a millionaire out of the first guy to get to<br>
 the patent office, can't possibly be "supressed" by anyone, and the<br>
 larger the corporation, the /less/ likely it is that there will be leaks.<br>
 Hell, Texaco couldn't even keep secret that one of their executives<br>
 referred to black employees as "black jelly beans".  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
i dont think its a secret, ive heard that oil companies have bought and hold<br>
dozens of patents for alternatives that would make things better for us, but<br>
make the oil companies lose money, and the same for the car companies, with<br>
alternative engines etc...   Ill try and find some examples... as for the<br>
light bulbs, i read an article on it.<br>
