<i>&gt; It was announced today that the company OpenMarket was granted patents</i><br>
<i>&gt; for some basic web related devices.  More information can be found at</i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.openmarket.com">http://www.openmarket.com</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; My question is: Does the prior, public usage by myself and other persons</i><br>
<i>&gt; prior to the filing of these particular patents in anyway invalidate said</i><br>
<i>&gt; patents?  Besides the fact that it is obscene to patent something so obvious</i><br>
<i>&gt; and low on the ingenuity scale, I find myself severely irritated by their</i><br>
<i>&gt; successful patent attempt of something that was already in the public domain</i><br>
<i>&gt; for all intents and purposes.  Any programmer worth a damn would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; devised such things on their own and, not surprisingly, many did.</i><br>
<p>
(1) Even after these many years of use in the software business,<br>
the Supreme Court has not ruled that /any/ "algorithm" patents are<br>
valid.  In fact, they've quite clearly stated that they are not,<br>
but they did so as dicta in opinions that upheld the patentability<br>
of devices whose only distinguishing characteristic is an algorithm,<br>
so the USPTO and the industry has taken that to mean such patents<br>
are valid, and thousands have been issued.  Since that ruling the<br>
court has become less IP-friendly, but the legislature has become<br>
moreso; it's anybody's guess how the issue will be settled.<br>
<p>
(2) To be patentable, a work must be both "novel" and "unobvious".<br>
This probably fails both tests, but since the USPTO issued it anyway<br>
(they have no competent computer scientists, so they've issued<br>
patents for such absurdly obvious things as XOR cursors and natural-<br>
order spreadsheet recalc), there is for the moment a presumtion in<br>
the minds of most equally incompetent trial judges that the USPTO<br>
knew what it was doing.  The holder can sue you for infringement and<br>
you will have to defend yourself at no small expense.<br>
<p>
(3) The nature of the net changes the dynamics of the litigation a<br>
little bit.  It is rare to have an invention that a million people<br>
can vouch for being used earlier, and for being obvious.  Something<br>
as common as Net shopping-carts also will have media attention.<br>
Mass protest is also a distinct possibility.  Imagine thousands of<br>
small-time net merchants thumbing their nose at it; there's little<br>
the patent holder could do against them all.<br>
<p>
(4) If the patent /is/ valid (hard to imagine, but possible), it<br>
belongs to the person who first "invented" (i.e., conceived) of it,<br>
/provided that "due diligence" was maintained in reducing it to<br>
practice/.  That is, it doesn't matter what the filing date was if<br>
the holder can prove that (a) he had the idea before, and (b) he<br>
was diligent in bringing the idea to fruition since then.  So you<br>
will need to look for prior art as early as possible, not just any<br>
prior to the filing date.  Preferably something before the company<br>
in question was formed.<br>
