<i>&gt; Although I recognize the libertarian yearnings behind your postings,</i><br>

<i>&gt; factor in sexuality as physical readiness, and fetishes (not a</i><br>
<i>&gt; sickness, BTW) and rape inclinations do not stem from sexual</i><br>
<i>&gt; deprivation.  Therapists treat thousands of individuals yearly in my</i><br>
<i>&gt; country alone for the damage caused by pedophiliac activities or</i><br>
<i>&gt; pressure to have sex at a young age. Given the difficulty in</i><br>
<i>&gt; repairing that kind of damage, I'd rather have a young person</i><br>
<i>&gt; chomping at the bit a little prior to engaging in any serious sexual</i><br>
<i>&gt; activities.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not completely sure how emotional readiness is founded in biology,<br>
but psychology is a different matter.  Psychology is the understanding<br>
of the mind by diversity from what is considered normal.  It is based<br>
on the very same social biases that cause the problems it tries to<br>
understand.  We then use therapy to try and solve these problems, but<br>
never in this process to we question "normal."  It is merely based on<br>
social trends and has no grounding in scientific fact.  So if my<br>
comments are unfounded in psychology, it's because psychology is a<br>
product of the problem.<br>
<p>
Now, I do not expect you to give much credence to these ideas, but I<br>
would ask you to give them some thought.  If the ideas I express can<br>
do a better job of explaining these problems than traditional<br>
psychology then I would expect you to take them more seriously.  So<br>
challenge these ideas, give reasons why they are not true.  Just<br>
because something is the accepted way of explaining a problem it does<br>
not make it the only way of explaining a problem.  <br>
