<i>&gt;&gt; Well, the nazis approved something *they* called assisted suicide. It was</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; called Euthanasia.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;and it was hardly voluntary. I would hardly call the way your socialist</i><br>
buddies<br>
<i>&gt;in china harvest organs from prisoners as 'assisted suicide' either.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
"My socialist buddies in China"? I don't know anyone there except one fellow<br>
who asked me if he could have the source code of my text2html converter. The<br>
description 'socialist' hardly fits here, though. It's a capitalist<br>
dictatorship with a red flag.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; There are different conservative groups. One is the religous-right,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Republican group. You're hardly part of that group. But there's also a</i><br>
group<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of technology freaks that argue based on ideas that were refuted a long</i><br>
time<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ago. I call this conservative. You call it Extropy.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;You should look at the political arena as more of an x/y coordinate system,</i><br>
<i>&gt;rather than just a right left spectrum. One axis represents relative social</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom, and the other represents relative economic freedom. While American</i><br>
<i>&gt;conservatives occupy the high economic,low social freedom corner, and nazis</i><br>
and<br>
<i>&gt;communists occupy the low economic, low social freedom corner, libertarians</i><br>
<i>&gt;occupy the high, high corner, while the international anarchists typically</i><br>
are<br>
<i>&gt;in the high social, low economic corner.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Freedom, freedom, freedom. I always hear freedom. As free decision is a<br>
myth, who is free? The perfect slave thinks he's free. Maybe the loan<br>
slavery in capitalist countries is just much more subtle to seize, together<br>
with the great media propaganda telling us how free we are compared to those<br>
poor, oppressed North Koreans, Chinese, Cubans, Vietnamese (the propaganda<br>
has, however, declined since 1991 and focused on other important issues like<br>
the evilness of Saddam Hussain and the Serbian atrocities.)<br>
<p>
The best definition of freedom probably comes from the anarcho-socialists.<br>
Not being oppressed by power structures while, at the same time, helping to<br>
advance evolution. Such a freedom is entirely impossible in a "free market".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Categorizing me in with religiouys conservatives is as insulting as puttin</i><br>
an<br>
<i>&gt;anarchist in with Stalin. Please be more discrete in your definitions.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You see, I have really lost the feeling for how people may react to certain<br>
sentences. I see parallels between Extropians and religous conservatives. As<br>
you say, they are mostly on the economic level. But decisions on this level<br>
determine the outlook of a society.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Not a bad analogy, but possibly more renaissance, depending on what</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;characteristics of the middle ages you are referring to. If you are</i><br>
talking<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;about free enterprise, low tax, self reliant, spirit of exploration and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;adventure, then I wont argue.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Spirit of exploration and adventure. ROTFL. A good way to describe the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; crusades in an advertising of the vatican.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;A good way to describe the age of exploration, or of the Viking era. My own</i><br>
<i>&gt;family lived in Nova Scotia prior to Jamestown and the Mayflower, at least</i><br>
part<br>
<i>&gt;of the year.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
There are clues that the Phoenicians have reached America. The Romans<br>
circumvented Africa. They built better ships, had generally higher<br>
technology (besides the steam engine, electricity and their consequences,<br>
there's little they didn't have) , more social and economic freedom and a<br>
much higher standard of living than the Middle (AKA Dark)  Ages could ever<br>
attain. On the other hand, the welfare of the empire was guaranteed by the<br>
emperors. If the money concentration got too big, they probably tried to<br>
redistribute it. Too bad they couldn't prevent it.<br>
<p>
The Christians murdered millions, buried the knowledge of the Romans and<br>
maintained power (and stagnation) for nearly one millenium. The Dark Ages<br>
were the worst time this planet has ever gone through.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I disagree, as the idea that the state has the right to use deadly force in</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;redistributing my property which they confiscate from me without due</i><br>
process or<br>
<i>&gt;proper Constitutional authority is not even worth discussing.</i><br>
<p>
Because you don't consider yourself as a part of the human community, but as<br>
an isolated being which has, for some strange reasons, the right to<br>
accumulate scarce goods and the currency necessary to acquire them.<br>
Accumulation of information, external sensors and memory, the transhuman<br>
'properties' you described, is OK. But in today's world, the resources must<br>
be distributed equally in order to allow everyone to participate in the<br>
great game of life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And what is "non-transhumanist property" anyways? Just what you define it</i><br>
as, or<br>
<i>&gt;the state? Property is property. Whether it is "non-transhumanist" or not</i><br>
is<br>
<i>&gt;merely due to whether it is in the hands of a transhumanist or not. Nobody</i><br>
else<br>
<i>&gt;has the authority to decide otherwise.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I said "non-transhuman property". By my definition, a transhuman is a being<br>
which has already transcended, and such a being does, according to my<br>
knowledge, not exist on this planet. We're still unconnected carbon bags<br>
filled with water. As such, we are all dependant on this planet's resources.<br>
Private property of goods and currency must not exist in an environment<br>
where goods are not reproducable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Really, funny, the native Americans might have something to say about the</i><br>
idea<br>
<i>&gt;that natural selection doesn't apply to cultural evolution, especially the</i><br>
dead<br>
<i>&gt;ones. So might the Nazis, the Communists, and today, the French, as their</i><br>
<i>&gt;uncompetetive little culture is getting overrun by Americanization (as most</i><br>
<i>&gt;other undynamic cultures are today). As tacky as you might think it is, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;current American Culture seems to presently be the most competetive culture</i><br>
in<br>
<i>&gt;current existence (Or North American culture, as a Canadian would say ;)).</i><br>
Of<br>
<i>&gt;course that could change, and if it does, we could all be eating tofu.....</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's the failure, you know. The Americans didn't become a superpower<br>
because they were so clever. They've earned a golden nose with both World<br>
Wars, whereas the British Empire was eliminated as a superpower already<br>
after WW I. The German economy didn't fare so well after WW II because the<br>
politicians were so intelligent, but because it was greatly funded by the<br>
US.<br>
<p>
History could also look completely different, if, after WW I, Germany had<br>
decided to cooperate with Russia. Such a plan was made, by Weimar state<br>
secretary Rathenau. Remember the contract of Rapallo? It allowed the Germans<br>
to quit reparation payments and to build and test weapons in the SU.<br>
Unfortunately (probably), Rathenau was assassinated in 1922.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC.<br>
Unfortunately, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865.<br>
Unfortunately, John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.<br>
Unfortunately, Lee Harvey Oswald was assassinated two days later.<br>
Unfortunately, Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968.<br>
Unfortunately, Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968.<br>
<p>
I wouldn't call this kind of selection natural.<br>
<p>
Human history is a long row of bad coincidences, backstabbings and battles<br>
for power.<br>
<p>
Evolution is the survival of the lifeform which fits itself best into the<br>
environment. In cultural evolution, the environment is information,<br>
memetics, an ever-changing flux. Neither the better one nor the more<br>
unscrupulous one will win in the end -- the end is open. Makes things a<br>
little more exciting, doesn't it?<br>
<p>
