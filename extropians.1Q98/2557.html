Do we have to go over this again? If this were so, John, when you put a<br>
polarization filter at a 1 deg. angle to a vertically polarized light source, you<br>
would get no light through it. Since you don't then this isn't so. Polarization is<br>
an x/y polar vector combination (meaning you are going to get the square root of<br>
-1 in there somewhere, which is hardly binary). If it weren't, and what you said<br>
was true, then we'd be able to tell by the polarization of light which way was<br>
absolutely up in the universe. Since we can't and everything is relative, then<br>
what you are saying isn't so.<br>
<p>
That being said, when people refer to the digital vs. analog dichotomy, they<br>
really mean binary vs. analog.<br>
<p>
When people think 'digital' they mean that they are thinking in terms of b&amp;w,<br>
on/off, flip/flop, rather than the many shades of grey that most people prefer to<br>
muddy their thinking with. This is why Mr. Jones objects to seeing AI's as 'human'<br>
since they will be much more logical and straightforward than humans, and will not<br>
be prone to the grey muddy thinking that he sees as the hallmark of 'human'<br>
intelligence.<br>
