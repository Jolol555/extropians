These WA pigs. They said that since a) I was a stockholder in a WA<br>
corporation, that made me a resident (even though the articles of<br>
incorporation signed by the secty of state recognised my NH residency)<br>
and that since I had a 'record' of a ticket, that that made me a<br>
resident, even though I was registered to vote in, and kept my legal<br>
residence in and DL in NH.<br>
<p>
Well, even here, in Lebanon, NH, a lot of people work in vermont but<br>
live in NH and have to deal with vermonts income tax. I'm currently a<br>
contractor to a vermont located company, but since my office is in NH<br>
and they have a post office box in Hanover, NH, I get all of my checks<br>
paid to me through a bank account that is on their hanover PO box. A lot<br>
of people in this area who both live and work in VT get a NH post office<br>
box for a year to establish residency and to try to work this dodge.<br>
<p>
I know that Washington State is a bit rabid about claiming as many<br>
residencies as possible since there is a loophole in their sales tax<br>
that exempts residents of states that have no sales tax (New Hampshire<br>
happens to be one of the 8 remaining, which was the main reason for my<br>
doing my utmost retain my NH residency, outside of coming from a state<br>
with the cool motto of "Live Free or Die", for a while there in Seattle,<br>
freinds were calling me "Sales Tax Mikey" since they were asking me to<br>
make purchases for them... he he.), and the citizens do as much work<br>
trying to get out of the consequences. Most southern Washington state<br>
residents try at one time or another to get an Oregon address<br>
established. One guy even got elected to the state senate in WA, but got<br>
caught later having an Oregon registered car (which he stupidly used to<br>
commute to Olympia for senate sessions).<br>
