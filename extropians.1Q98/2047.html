   Cannabis: UN report leaked<br>
<p>
   By Tim Radford, Science Editor<br>
<p>
The Guardian   Thursday February 19, 1998<br>
<p>
   United Nations health chiefs suppressed a finding that cannabis is<br>
   safer than either alcohol or tobacco, according to a report today.<br>
<p>
   A World Health Organisation report published in December was to have<br>
   concluded that even if cannabis was consumed on the same scale as<br>
   cigarettes and whisky, it would probably still be safer than either,<br>
   but the passage was scrapped at the last moment, says the magazine New<br>
   Scientist.<br>
<p>
   The comparison with alcohol and tobacco, the suppressed passage said,<br>
   was made "not to promote one drug over another but rather to minimise<br>
   double standards that have operated in appraising the health effects<br>
   of cannabis".<br>
<p>
   The disputed passage was leaked to New Scientist after it was<br>
   withdrawn, reportedly in response to pressure from the US National<br>
   Institute on Drug Abuse and the UN International Drug Control<br>
   Programme. It says: "In developed societies cannabis appears to play<br>
   little role in injuries caused by violence, as does alcohol." It also<br>
   says there is good evidence that alcohol can harm foetal development,<br>
   while the evidence that cannabis can harm foetal development is "far<br>
   from conclusive".<br>
<p>
   The WHO report does admit that, like heavy drinking, marijuana smoking<br>
   can produce psychosis in susceptible people. It also says chronic<br>
   cannabis smoking may contribute to cancers of the aerodigestive tract.<br>
   But one lung disease researcher, Donald Tashkin of the University of<br>
   California at Los Angeles, found that volunteers who smoked three<br>
   joints a day had much the same lung capacity and function as those who<br>
   smoked none.<br>
<p>
   However, dope smokers must inhale deeply and hold the smoke in the<br>
   lungs, so they got a large dose of potentially damaging tar.<br>
<p>
   The leaked UN report comes at a time of renewed pressure to think<br>
   again about drug policies.<br>
