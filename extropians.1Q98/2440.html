<p>
Actually, I think John was saying that he thought it might cost ten times the<br>
approximately $100 million figure I supplied to make a supertanker liveable.<br>
I don't know if it would be that much, but the all-in cost of acquiring and<br>
converting a very large tanker would surely be more than $200 million and<br>
probably at least $300 million.  To my subjective sense of economic<br>
proportion, this seems like such a high threshold of investment that the<br>
benefits offered by such an extra-national enclave would have to be VERY great<br>
in comparison to continuing a business within the confines of existing<br>
national territories.<br>

<p>
A few points here.  Unlike the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the U.S.<br>
has formally ratified the UNOST.  This isn't surprising, since the U.S. is one<br>
of the three sponsoring or "repository" countries for that treaty.  The U.S.<br>
signed the treaty on January 27, 1967, the very first day it was opened for<br>
signature.  (<a href="http://www.acda.gov/treaties/space5.txt">http://www.acda.gov/treaties/space5.txt</a>)  However, note that the<br>
U.S. accepts UNCLOS as the codification of "customary international law" on<br>
all but one point (the "common heritage of mankind" provisions relating to<br>
seabed resources beyond the 200-mile EEZ limit).  UNOST doesn't contain the<br>
"common heritage" idea.<br>
<p>
The reference to "flagging" of spacecraft raises some interesting points.<br>
UNOST clearly calls for the concept of nationality of spacecraft and surface<br>
outposts, and I assume that states will simply adopt the maritime conventions<br>
and customs of "flagging" as the number of spacecraft continue to proliferate.<br>
Thus, while UNOST seems to have blocked the exportation of sovereign<br>
territoriality off Earth, the way is already clear for exportation of existing<br>
national legal regimes.<br>
<p>
"De-flagging" an existing spacecraft would be perceived as an act of rebellion<br>
against the whole concept of sovereign-based law and even token acts of this<br>
kind would likely be treated with hostility by the major space-faring powers,<br>
as they would fear the establishment of a precedent.  Accordingly, I would<br>
counsel that anyone planning such an act be fairly certain of their own<br>
physical self-sufficiency off earth before making themselves a test case.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  In any event, its not like the UN has any space</i><br>
<i>&gt;  capability of its own. How can you enforce a law when you have no means of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  enforcement? As recent events indicate, enforcement of UN 'laws' only</i><br>
occurs <br>
<i>&gt; when</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the US indicates a willingness to bomb somebody. Since its not in the US's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  interest to enforce this particular treaty, then I doubt very much that it </i><br>
<i>&gt; has any</i><br>
<i>&gt;  hope of ever gaining any teeth.</i><br>
<p>
International law is certainly peculiar (but of great interest to extropians),<br>
since it is law without an over-arching sovereign for enforcement.  The basic<br>
concept in international law is the idea of conventions or "customs" that<br>
define standards of national conduct, which all nations are free to enforce,<br>
so long as they themselves observe the customary international law.  UN<br>
resolutions and the like are simply treated as very specific expressions of<br>
international convention, since the existing theory of sovereignty can't abide<br>
any sort of "international government".<br>
<p>
The idea behind the UNOST's prohibition of national territoriality off earth<br>
was based on the model of the Antarctica Treaty of some years before:<br>
Avoidance of an arms race or some form of colonialism in new territory.  So<br>
long as the U.S. remains preeminent in space exploration, it seems to me to<br>
have little "national interest" in changing this agreement.<br>
