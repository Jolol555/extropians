Years ago I fantasized about a new type of series similar to outer limits but<br>
that was trans and post-humanist.  The basic idea was that humanity had left<br>
Earth omni-directionally in a great diaspora of thousands of ark ships ranging<br>
in size from a few dozen people to tens of thousands.  Each episode would<br>
freature the unique psychological, societal, experimental environs of one of<br>
these ark ships.  Episodes would feature experiments with new money systems,<br>
belief systems, biological and neuro-enhancements, radical brain change and<br>
altered sates of conciousness, new relationship structure - polyfidelity,<br>
polygamy, etc.<br>
<p>
This type of series would be the perfect medium in which to push the boundaries<br>
of "acceptable" television.  I still think its a good idea.  Anyone have any<br>
Hollywood connections?<br>
