Wrong.  There is no DESCRIPTION without context and contrast.<br>
Identity - "every thing is equal to itself" - needs neither.<br>
<p>
My sentence quoted above was in a discussion of the value of<br>
"centralism" as a DESCRIPTIVE term.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   When we say what an elephant is (a member</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of X family of animals that live in Y set</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of locations), we put it in context, yet</i><br>
<i>&gt;   when we say what A is, "A=A," we remove</i><br>
<i>&gt;   it from context.</i><br>
<p>
So what?  "A=A" is not an attempt at description, hence it needs no<br>
context.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When I define identity</i><br>
<i>&gt;   as "A is A relative to ~A,"  I put it</i><br>
<i>&gt;   in context, as it exists in reality.</i><br>
<p>
And you wrench the word _identity_ away from how it has been defined and<br>
used for centuries, because you are too lazy to coin a more accurate<br>
term for what you're defining - and/or too much in love with the idea of<br>
yourself as Great Philosopher to adopt words that other people have used<br>
for what you call "identity", words like _description_ and<br>
_characteristics_ and _qualities_.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Nobody has ever shown me an example of</i><br>
<i>&gt;   a thing, A, being A free from relation,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and yet all those who cannot show that</i><br>
<i>&gt;   such is true, continue to claim that</i><br>
<i>&gt;   it is. That defines crackpotism.</i><br>
<p>
Or illustrates your bullheaded refusal to understand common language.<br>
