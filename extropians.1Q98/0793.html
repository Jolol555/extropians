<p>
I suppose that you could store information by the position of a particle<br>
in a box, and then if you could make the box twice as big, you could<br>
store an extra bit of information (not a perfect example, due to the<br>
momentum uncertainty, but maybe there are nondemolition measurement<br>
systems which would work better).<br>
<p>
In The Physics of Immortality, Frank Tipler argues that open universes<br>
impose limits on calculation.  Unfortunately his argument is not technical.<br>
Here is what he says, on page 139 (chapter 3, section "Experimental Tests<br>
of the Omega Point Theory"):<br>
<p>
"As I discussed in Chapter III, Freeman Dyson pointed out that, although<br>
the energy is available in open and flat universes, the information<br>
processing must be carried out over larger and larger proper volumes.<br>
This fact ultimately makes impossible any communication between opposite<br>
sides of the 'living' region in a flat universe, because the redshift<br>
implies that arbitrarily large amounts of energy must be used to signal,<br>
and Dyson showed that only a finite amount of energy is availble.<br>
On the other hand, open universes expand so fast in the far future that<br>
it becomes impossible for structures to form of sufficiently larger and<br>
larger size to store a diverging amount of information."<br>
<p>
Most of Tipler's book is devoted to exploring how things would go in a<br>
closed universe, and he doesn't go into much detail about exactly what the<br>
problems are in an open universe.  He doesn't refer to any technical<br>
references to buttress the argument above, and it doesn't seem to be<br>
mentioned in the "appendix for scientists".<br>
<p>
I don't completely follow what Tipler's point is about redshifts.<br>
I don't think he is saying that signalling involves a loss of energy,<br>
since the photon used to signal can be recaptured, and although it will<br>
be redshifted, the universe has cooled by the same factor so the photon's<br>
energy upon recapture should be just as useful as the energy which was<br>
used to create it.<br>
<p>
He may be saying that at some point there won't be enough energy in<br>
the whole universe to create a single photon of enough energy to signal<br>
from one side of the computer to the other.  Apparently there is only a<br>
finite amount of energy in the (accessible?) universe.  But I'm not sure<br>
that there is a threshold energy which would be necessary to create the<br>
signalling photon; perhaps photons can have arbitrarily small energies,<br>
as long as they are hotter than the background.<br>
