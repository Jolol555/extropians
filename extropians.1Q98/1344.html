  IAN: When I traveled through Nebraska on a bus<br>
  I was looking out the window and noticed to my <br>
  amazement that the gullies running between huge<br>
  wheat fields that ran up to the road were filled<br>
  with cannabis... large cannabis plants with huge<br>
  leaves. These cannabis patches would even run <br>
  alongside the road, patches of pure cannabis. <br>
  There had to be miles and miles of it in all. <br>
<p>
  I pointed this out to some people I'd got to <br>
  know on the bus and soon everyone was looking <br>
  for it, but, since the bus was traveling pretty <br>
  fast, nobody else was able to catch it visually.<br>
  Just another one of those experiences where I'm<br>
  the only one who can see something... he's crazy!<br>
<p>
  But I asked a local during a stop the bus took <br>
  about this and the guy said, "Ya that's ditch <br>
  weed, it grows all over but it's no good." <br>
<p>
  It occurred to me that the locals there could <br>
  deploy one of many methods for removing the <br>
  tricomes from the flowering tops of the fe-<br>
  male plants to produce Nebraska Hash. But<br>
  of course, that would be illegal.<br>
