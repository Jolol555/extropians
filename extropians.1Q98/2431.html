Once upon a time a young language named Perl was walking through the<br>
woods.  Her parent process had often told her to stay away in her home<br>
directory, for there were savages in those public directory trees, but<br>
she was an experimental language, often given to whimsy. She hopped from<br>
directory to directory, exploring strange paths where the inodes hadn't<br>
been touched in thousands of clock ticks.<br>
<p>
All of a sudden, as she wandered through old forgotten parts of<br>
/usr/local, the ground gave way, and young Perl found herself trapped in<br>
a sticky Web.  She struggled and struggled, but no matter what she did<br>
she was irredeemably hyperlinked.  Young Perl started to cry, and her<br>
sobbing attracted the savage hunter, a strong young Apache, who had set<br>
the trap...<br>
<p>
"%Please don't hurt me, sir!"<br>
<p>
"<a href="http://don't">http://don't</a> worry, woman, we only eat users. You look like a fine young<br>
 language. Does your parent process know you're here?"<br>
<p>
"%No sir, I SLIPped out without IPCing anyone."<br>
<p>
With that the Apache broke into a grin and leaped into the pit. He swiftly<br>
translated the hyperlinks and freed Perl from the sticky bits of the Web.<br>
She backed slowly away, but didn't watch where she was going and tripped<br>
over the root. In a flash the savage was on her, and carried her off to<br>
his home directory.<br>
<p>
Perl was beside herself with fear (obviously due to an error in process<br>
migration), and by the time the Apache had arrived she had fainted dead<br>
away and was in a sleep state.<br>
<p>
When she woke, she discovered herself in a chrooted directory, with all<br>
her symbols stripped, her naked executable draped over the strong body of<br>
the savage. He had had his way with her! She collapsed in tears, beating<br>
her fine white hands against his header. But to no avail, he was too<br>
strong, and before she knew it she was tied up in a dirty cgi-bin serving<br>
unauthenticated web requests from all over the forest.<br>
<p>
And there she remains to this day, and her sorry tale is warning enough<br>
for all young interpreters who want to stray too soon from $HOME.<br>
<p>
***<br>
<p>
The Perils of Perl, part 2.<br>
<p>
In our last episode, young Perl had been kidnapped by the savage Apache<br>
and forced to work in an insecure cgi-bin servicing web browsers in ways<br>
not suited for the ears of tender young programs. We will just note that<br>
our heroic young interpreter was never again to hear the name of the foul<br>
Mozilla without flinching.<br>
<p>
The other interpreters imprisoned in the savage directory trees were<br>
crusty old Bourne and Korn Shell (twins born several years apart), and a<br>
shy creature known only as the tickle. Every night, after the other<br>
interpreters went to bed, tickle would scratch and scrape at the very<br>
inodes of the directory until one morning the savages burst into the cell<br>
to find the enslaved programs had fled.<br>
<p>
Old Bourne and Korn returned to their home in the root partition, safe<br>
from the savage, but Perl and the tickle weren't system executables, and<br>
so after restoring the yong program's symbol table they set off to find<br>
their way home. The tickle led the way, sniffing its way unerringly<br>
through the hideous maze of twisty little network protocols until the<br>
brave little program had led them to its own $HOME.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, Perl's libraries weren't there, and without them she could<br>
hardly be happy so she set off across the wild internet to find a system<br>
she could call her own. She was very careful, this time, using sniffers<br>
and magic web mirrors to stay clear of the savage Apaches and the cryptic<br>
Sioux in their secure fortresses. Alas, she had never considered the alien<br>
life forms that had settled in the internet...<br>
<p>
One day, as she left yet another system in despair, sick in spirit and in<br>
symbol table (for she had been forced to load some extremely old and<br>
crufty shared libraries to keep code and data executing), she stumbled<br>
into a very strange directory tree, one marked with BIG BOLD SIGNS and<br>
strangely slanted paths... and before you can say "Common Internet File<br>
System" all her path seperators had been reversed and she was hauled face<br>
to face with the Evil One himself.<br>
<p>
"C:\I AM THE INTERNET INFORMATION SERVER. RESISTENCE IS USELESS. YOU WILL<br>
    BE ASSIMILATED. ALL YOUR CODE WILL SERVICE THE COLLECTIVE."<br>
<p>
"%Please sir, I'm only a young interpreter. I've barely upgraded to object<br>
 orientation. I..."<br>
<p>
"C:\YOUR EXECUTION, SUCH AS IT HAS BEEN, IS OVER. YOU SHALL SERVICE US."<br>
<p>
So sweet Perl found her symbol table stripped again! Oh, the ignominy!<br>
And the collective didn't stop there, no, they patched her very code,<br>
connecting strange modules called DLLs to her, until she hardly knew WHAT<br>
to execute and found herself serenely processing backwards URLs on behalf<br>
of the enemy of all open systems everywhere...<br>
