With the arrival of full-blown nanotech, AI, uploading and the like the ecosystem<br>
of earth will no longer be significant to our survival. In fact, worsening<br>
environmental<br>
conditions might actually have a positive effect by bringing the singularity nearer.<br>
In emergency situations, there is often more progress than usual, just look at the<br>
Ice Age(s), the two World Wars and the Cold War. Ok, it's a gamble, but a rational<br>
one.<br>

I don't know whether or not it is extropian, but from a "common sense"<br>
point of view more complexity certainly isn't *always* good. IMO, the most<br>
important things are to survive and thrive. To achieve this, sometimes one<br>
has to increase complexity (to make certain plants more productive, for example), <br>
and sometimes decrease it (like when wiping out a disease/other threat). More <br>
complexity = good is just a pointless dogma. Your well-being is the ultimate<br>
goal, everything else is just a tool. Really.<br>
