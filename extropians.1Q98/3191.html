One consideration I read recently:<br>
<p>
If Social Security makes errors in 1% of its checks,<br>
then next week 250,000 people will call its offices<br>
which will completely overwhelm its response capacities<br>
for all problems, and create a huge number of exceptions<br>
that the system is not prepared to handle even under normal<br>
conditions - and that can trigger many more yet unfixed parts<br>
of y2k-related code.<br>
<p>
Many social systems are sensitive to rates of change, rather<br>
than amplitudes.  Needs for many resources change like that,<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
I think lack of press is to a large extent explained by the<br>
fact that people cannot understand the unusual system issues.<br>
It's much easier to attract public attention with teenage<br>
shooting or political scandals.  Even serious journalists<br>
have no clue who to believe on the issues, and cannot suggest<br>
any reasonable coverage - though this exactly the reason why<br>
the issue should be debated more, not less.<br>
<p>
The profit strategy for the disaster scenario should be quite<br>
simple: buy lots of small exchangeable things and tangible<br>
property with borrowed money, and get out of locations with<br>
potential riots.<br>
<p>
Profit strategy for a milder scenario must be more complicated;<br>
there should be companies, currencies, and goods that will<br>
react differently to financial perturbations.  Does Japan<br>
have the same amount of outdated code?  If not, buying yen<br>
options together with precious metal options ("far out of the<br>
money") could be a good idea.  Are there companies providing<br>
work force for answering services or private guards?<br>
<p>
There are several sites and at least a couple of newsgroups<br>
devoted to possible social and economic consequences of this<br>
problem.<br>
<p>
And then, there are other things - it appears that much of<br>
financial software can't handle Dow indexes over 10,000 - that's<br>
a "D10K" problem - and it will hit at about the same time as Y2K...<br>
