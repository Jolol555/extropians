<i>&gt; &gt; From:          Jeff Fabijanic &lt;jeff@primordialsoft.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; So if one company has more money than the others, it should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; allowed to charge less than cost for it's product?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jeff, if somebody gives you a gift, do you return it and scold them</i><br>
<i>&gt; for this horribly immoral and anti-competitive act?</i><br>
<p>
Huh? If they gave me that gift in order that other people would not<br>
be in a position to give me any gifts in the future, I guess I<br>
would. But that's the point - a single enlightened consumer is still<br>
at a disadvantage when dealing with disengenuous practices like this<br>
- I may not fall for it, you may not fall for it, but if most folks<br>
fall for the trick, it's been played on you and me as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Doesn't this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; leads to a situation where, in order to compete in the short run,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other companies are forced to do the same or lose customers?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If my competitor is selling at a loss, I need to maintain enough of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; presence in the market that people don't forget about me; and I need</i><br>
<i>&gt; to keep up my *capacity* for production.  But it's an excellent time</i><br>
<i>&gt; to improve my *quality* and my *cost effectiveness*, because if some</i><br>
<i>&gt; of that capacity is temporarily shut down for renovation it's no big</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem: I *expect* my sales to temporarily drop.</i><br>
<p>
How do you manage to maintain any of those things when you have no<br>
money coming in? How do you pay rent on your facilities or pay your<br>
engineers to design you that better, cheaper widget? If you and Mr.<br>
Money-bags have similar factories, and they each cost $1M a month to<br>
run, and you have $6M reserves, and he has $60M, and he dumps his<br>
widgets on the market at a loss price that no short-term increase in<br>
productivity can match - you will run out of money quickly. He can<br>
sacrifice $10M so that you go out of business, and he now has the<br>
total market and makes up his losses in a year or two. Your improved<br>
widget that was slated for next year will never make it to market,<br>
not because you didn't run a tight ship, or pay your workers enough,<br>
or have a good product, but simply because your competitor dumped.<br>
Mr. Bags will continue to sell his old-style, inefficient widget to<br>
a mostly unknowing market.<br>
<p>
Happens with OSes all the time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The only question is: do I have the reserves to survive the slow</i><br>
<i>&gt; period -- or, failing that, can I convince bankers and venture</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalists to provide those reserves?  Most likely this will be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; *lot* easier if I can convince them that my competitor is indeed</i><br>
<i>&gt; selling at a loss.</i><br>
<p>
Why? Why would they care? If he has 50% share now, but by dumping<br>
can get 100% soon, why wouldn't some VCs and bankers just side with<br>
him? Maybe you get some VC/bank money too, but this just prolongs<br>
the game, it doesn't modify the strategy in any real sense. And by<br>
the way, you don't get loans from venture capital firms - you sell<br>
off pieces of your company. So soliciting VC money in a situation<br>
like this just means you're choosing which shark will eat you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Wouldn't that just mean that the company with the most money to burn</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; at the start of this cycle will probably last longest? And after the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other competitors starve, the consumers are left with fewer choices</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in the long run.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The long run is precisely why this sort of predatory pricing doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; work.</i><br>
<p>
History does not bear you out. Diamond industry is a good example.<br>
South African Cos did the dumping strategy for many decades, forced<br>
other big players out, then leveraged their overwhelming mkt share<br>
into strong agreements with intl buyers. New players, even with<br>
advantage of better tech and deep supply and *much* cheaper prices,<br>
were unable to break into mkt, which now sells precious gems for<br>
many multiples of their production cost. Russians got let in on the<br>
scheme only after making it obvious that they would use *state*<br>
power to get in on the gravy. Rather than have the whole house of<br>
cards tumble, SAs let Russians in on the deal. Competitors without<br>
benefit of world's second largest armed forces are not so<br>
fortunate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Suppose that a company manages, by selling at a loss, to become a</i><br>
<i>&gt; monopoly (it has never [sic] happened, but let's suppose).  This is only</i><br>
<i>&gt; beneficial if it can make up that loss through later extraordinary</i><br>
<i>&gt; profits</i><br>
<p>
Untrue. If I sell at a 50% loss for a year, force competitors out,<br>
and then simply keep the prices the same while my costs decrease,<br>
it'll take me little time to make up my original losses - and I<br>
don't have worry about mature competitors, excessive marketing, etc.<br>
The consumers think they're getting a deal because the price has dropped<br>
over time, but most won't realize that it's still higher than it could have<br>
been, and they're stuck using version 1.0 when a faster, better, even<br>
cheaper Mk II could have been to mkt in the meantime.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; And that sucks - monocultures are prone to atrophy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and catastrophic failure.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fortunately, they don't survive without government intervention to</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent capitalism.</i><br>
<p>
But when they fail, the catastrophe point is more profound.<br>
Company stores were not protected by law, but rather enabled by the<br>
lack of it's presence. When that system finally failed, it was<br>
bloody and difficult - and involved *direct* and *physically<br>
coercive* interference by the state. Having a system of law that<br>
prevents abuses like that today has seemed to lead to more freedom<br>
and security with *less* bloodshed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Reportedly, Japan was selling RAM at a loss, government subsidized,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in order to take over the semiconductor business.  And you read</i><br>
<i>&gt; reports that Japan managed to force all US companies out of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; commodity RAM business.</i><br>
<p>
Of course, a big reason that the Japanese companies eventually<br>
backed off their dumping strategies was because of the trade<br>
sanctions threatened/carried out by the US gvt. in retaliation. I'd<br>
rather have rules of engagement that stopped the economic warfare<br>
from escalating in this manner.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The truth is that Japan has yet to surpass the United States in terms</i><br>
<i>&gt; of total RAM capacity produced.  IBM's US production for its own use</i><br>
<i>&gt; has always been more by itself than any two Japanese manufacturers'</i><br>
<i>&gt; total output.</i><br>
<p>
This doesn't jibe with what I know of semiconductor industry<br>
history. Can you give a couple pointers to support?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What Japan forced a bunch of US companies to do, was to stop</i><br>
<i>&gt; producing RAM for the wholesale market.  But those companies did not</i><br>
<i>&gt; shut down their production facilities -- they diverted the facilities</i><br>
<i>&gt; to more valuable processes, increasing their profitability.</i><br>
<p>
If you are stating this as a universal, then it's just not true. I<br>
am aware of several major RAM production facilities in TX that were<br>
shutdown, then sold and reconfigured to other industrial purposes<br>
altogether. The line engineers went to work for other co's (TI - &gt;<br>
Analog, in one case that I am personally familiar with, to<br>
Gillette(!) in another).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Remember that when Japan started this effort, RAM was selling at</i><br>
<i>&gt; hundreds of dollars per megabyte, wholesale.</i><br>
<p>
No, more like one hundred/meg, retail.  I was alive in the early 80s too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Today it sells at dollars per megabyte, retail.</i><br>
<p>
How many years later than it would have been? And how much economic<br>
disruption was caused therefrom? And there's far fewer small players<br>
in this mkt now not because of high production costs, but because<br>
it's generally accepted that you need deep pockets/govt help to<br>
survive in this industry of dirty tricks. You haven't made the case<br>
that this is an example of the market producing best outcomes by<br>
"allowing" dumping.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'm not for excessive gubbamint regulation, but likewise, I wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be in favor of any completely unregulated market scheme which didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; serve the ultimate interests of *individual humans* (ie consumers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and business people, not just the few richest businesses). I believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that the goal of any market system should be to get the maximum</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sustainable level of individual economic freedom and power for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; *humans*, not corporations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hm... start by eliminating the government interference in the free</i><br>
<i>&gt; market that makes "corporations" possible...</i><br>
<p>
So you're saying that we need to get rid of the idea of corporations<br>
first? OK. I'd be up for that. How should we go about it?<br>
