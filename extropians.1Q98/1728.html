 Space-filling isn't very usefull in the early stages of the pathway<br>
I'm describing. The main goal is to produce hinges from proteins attached<br>
at a few points to the adjacent protein or held in the right place by<br>
dna attached to both proteins, and build "arms" with several degrees<br>
of freedom out of this.<br>
 Attaching small pieces of dna to proteins is a bit easier than attaching<br>
proteins to proteins, and Bruce and Markus say they have new ideas for<br>
doing it better (they're keeping those ideas private for now).<br>
 There will be steps at which precise positioning of 2 proteins will<br>
be important. The dna scaffolding should be able to provide this in the<br>
earliest stages. In later stages, the "arms" will push the proteins into<br>
appropriate places.<br>
