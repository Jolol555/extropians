I think some of the motivation for the debate comes from an attitude<br>
which is not often stated but underlies the hostility towards artistic<br>
endeavors.  It can be expressed baldly as:<br>
<p>
  The discovery of penicillin has done more to increase the sum total of<br>
  human happiness than all of the great literature, paintings, and other<br>
  forms of art, combined.<br>
<p>
And similarly with other scientific discoveries.  The idea is that art<br>
is fundamentally a form of entertainment, something to occupy the mind.<br>
But the real changes in the world, the ones which will totally reshape<br>
human society over the next century, come from science and technology.<br>
<p>
All the transhumanist art in the world is not going to turn us into<br>
transhumans.  Only technology can do that.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying I share this attitude, but I think it is good to express<br>
it in bold and even offensive terms just to get it out in the open and<br>
let people respond.<br>
<p>
