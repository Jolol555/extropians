A while ago there was a discussion about the role of plastic foam in H-bombs;<br>
I think I've deleted most of the messages, but over the weekend I was able<br>
to collect my copy of Richard Rhode's book 'Dark Sun: The Making Of The<br>
Hydrogen Bomb', and look up what he said on the subject.<br>
<p>
He claims that the plastic on the original H-bomb test was placed around the<br>
inside of the bomb casing, not on the fusion core itself as I've read<br>
elsewhere. The X-rays from the initiator turn the plastic to plasma, which<br>
re-radiates X-rays onto the U-238 tamper, creating a rocket effect which<br>
implodes the fusion core. This also compresses the fission trigger in the<br>
middle of the fusion core, which explodes, compressing the fusion material<br>
from the inside as well, and igniting it.<br>
<p>
Interestingly, he also says that most of the yield in that test came from<br>
the U-238, as the fusion byproducts converted it into other, unstable,<br>
elements which then fissioned.<br>
<p>
While I can't vouch for technical accuracy, I'd recommend both of Rhodes' <br>
books to those interested in nuclear weapons technology.<br>
