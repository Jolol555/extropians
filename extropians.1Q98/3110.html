I'll chalk your excessive rudeness up to an unseemly love of your <br>
state and won't bother responding further in this forum.<br>

<i>&gt; So you're saying that we need to get rid of the idea of corporations</i><br>

<p>
Michael replied:<br>
<i>&gt;Easy, simply stop treating corporations as 'persons' under the law, </i><br>
<p>
This is pretty much what an "incorporated" individual is, so you <br>
seem to be saying "repeal the incorporation statutes". OK. Have <br>
to do it for each state of course - this'll take awhile (good thing <br>
we'll be here for at least a couple hundred more years...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and end much corporate liability protection</i><br>
<p>
It'll all go away if your first point is carried out. The only protection<br>
 corps offer is the fact that as an "individual" they shield their execs <br>
from liability - you can't find against one person for another <br>
"person's" crime. And now many states have started to include the<br>
idea of the "thinly-veiled" corporation - one which does not shield it's<br>
shareholders from liability at all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(while at the same time reforming the tort</i><br>
<i>&gt;process to prevent humongous punitive awards like $175 million to two former</i><br>
<i>&gt;Texaco employees, or $6 million to a granny who spilled coffee on her lap.)</i><br>
<p>
Why bother with this? I never understood why people get all upset <br>
over settlements like this. Who gives a fig if some older woman <br>
(her lawyers actually) make a big play? $6M is probably a single <br>
day's coffee profits for an org the size of MickeyD's. If the jury thought <br>
it was warranted, then let the lawyers fight it out. Award caps seem like<br>
mandatory sentences and term limits - attempts to micromanage the<br>
entire process of government from the legislative chamber.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If the individuals in a corporation were severally liable for the actions they</i><br>
<i>&gt;take in the conduct of their business, then they might start acting a lot more</i><br>
<i>&gt;nicely. At the same time, I'd also stop taxing both the corporation AND its</i><br>
<i>&gt;stockholders and employees. Have one tax (having it at the corporate level</i><br>
<i>&gt;would of course be the easiest and cheapest to administer).</i><br>
<p>
Huh? If you get rid of the "corporation", there won't be an entity at that <br>
level to tax. <br>
<p>
Fuzzy.<br>
