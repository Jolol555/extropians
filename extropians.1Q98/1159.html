Nice idea. Er, how smart are these robots? If they're<br>
less than human-equivalent, who tells 'em what to do? If they're<br>
human-equivalent or smarter, don't they have anything better to do with<br>
their free time than pander to the whims of cerebrally- hypertrophied<br>
apes? And where are they going to get the raw materials from?<br>

You paint a pretty picture. Somehow I don't think it's going to be<br>
that simple ...<br>
 <br>
Hmm. you might want to read some of Iain M. Banks' novels for a<br>
different take on a robotopia. (Personally, I'd _like_ to be a Mind.)<br>
