Depends. If I and others refuse to obey any new law against cloning, and<br>
get cloned, what can they do??? Kill the kid??? Since WE don't have to<br>
exert force, we can be protected by our civil disobedience rights. We<br>
just have to be willing to practice them, be willing to take the<br>
persecution, untill the public sees that we are willing to fight for our<br>
rights, and that it is they who are being the immoral ones, much as was<br>
done during the civil rights struggle here in the US. People respect you<br>
and your position once you prove you are willing to fight for it. Look<br>
at the PLO, its pretty well respected now, after having worn down the<br>
Isreali lobby after several decades of struggle.<br>
<p>
The point of any civil struggle is to demonstrate to the populace the<br>
brutality they must exert to enforce their prejudices. SInce most people<br>
don't like to see suffering, they will give up on their prejudices<br>
rather than continue the repression. At least thats how it can work with<br>
a relatively free press.<br>
