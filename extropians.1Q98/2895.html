<p>
That would be one central point, but I was including other components<br>
of free-market systems.<br>

<p>
It's what we've got, so it can't be that bad.<br>
<p>

<p>
'Out of control' isn't always such a 'bad' thing.  BTW, roads are also<br>
centralist.<br>
<p>
The system I was 'proposing' (yet another open network) doesn't really<br>
have "negative feedback" only positive feedback.  I don't see how this<br>
can go 'out of control', since it has no specific place to go in the<br>
first place.<br>

<i>&gt; everyone.</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't call it "surveillance" because the information is recorded<br>
by the people for their own benefit.<br>
