I found "Virtual Obsession" extremely disappointing, actually it<br>
breaks down like this:<br>
<p>
1st hour: okay, this might be cool.<br>
2nd hour: disappointment, why did they do this?<br>
3rd hour: absolute disgust, but I forced myself to watch the <br>
          ending.<br>
<p>
The ending was completely predictable, I thought a better ending<br>
(for our interests at least) would have had the guy in the<br>
wheelchair uploading, and everybody lives happily ever after.<br>
<p>
Cryonics (initially made to look good) was made to look<br>
ridiculous....<br>
<p>
The ludicrous science versus religion fight.....<br>
<p>
How long do you think it will take to lose the "exploding frozen<br>
head" meme.<br>
<p>
Thank goodness extropians and nanotechnology were spared....<br>
