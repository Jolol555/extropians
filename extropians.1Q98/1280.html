<i>&gt; From:          Anton Sherwood &lt;dasher@netcom.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Warrl writes</i><br>
<i>&gt; :   (... I somewhat favor a</i><br>
<i>&gt; : system where if "none of the above" wins, you get what the people</i><br>
<i>&gt; : voted for and skip the hassle and expense of a new election.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; : also want the government to be small enough that doing without</i><br>
<i>&gt; : any arbitrary elected official for a term would be no big deal.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Make a rule that if NOTA is elected to a legislature it always votes No,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and if NOTA is elected president/governor it vetoes all legislation.</i><br>
<p>
This could be a horrible obstacle to de-regulators.<br>
<p>
But at least for now it would be good.  I'd like to add that each <br>
legislative NOTA would be assigned a proportionate number of <br>
committee and subcommittee memberships (and chairmanships -- which <br>
could be interesting) based on the number of consecutive terms that <br>
district had elected NOTA; and that NOTA would always be presumed to <br>
be present for purposes of establishing a quorum.<br>
<p>
Eventually I'd like to see things reach a point where NOTA is <br>
frequently the only candidate in a legislative race, because the <br>
government -- local, state, or national -- is so unimportant that <br>
nobody in a district thinks it's worth their while.<br>
