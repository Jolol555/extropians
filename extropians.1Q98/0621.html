I just read an article in 'The New York Times' (on-line edition) that<br>
said there is a serious shortage of computer programmers in the world,<br>
that not enough people are going into computer science to keep up with<br>
the escalating demand for computer programmers.  This is good for the<br>
computer programmers, since their salaries tend to keep rising, but it is<br>
not so good for the development of information technologies since the<br>
less people there are advancing those technologies, the more slowly they<br>
will advance.<br>
<p>
What I was thinking would be a high priority for software development<br>
companies is a form of semi-automated programming software.  Basically,<br>
this would be a very high-level programming language which could help the<br>
programmer do in little time what previously took hours of coding.  Since<br>
it isn't likely that we'll see a significantly higher percentage of<br>
people becoming computer programmers, what we need are tools to help<br>
those programmers be much more productive with their time.  Also, tools<br>
like these will likely get rid of much of the more boring aspects of<br>
computer programming, which are boring because they require very little<br>
thought and could be better done by a computer.<br>
<p>
I know a lot of you on this list are computer programmers; do any of you<br>
know about developments in very high level programming languages?  <br>
