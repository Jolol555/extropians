Enzyme provides ``fountain of youth'' for cells<br>
By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Correspondent<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. scientists said Tuesday they had been<br>
able to make human cells live longer by tinkering with their<br>
genetic material, providing a ``fountain of youth'' for<br>
aging cells.<br>
News of the technology sent shares in California-based<br>
biotechnology group Geron Corp. up and raised hopes of new ways<br>
to treat diseases such as cancer.<br>
``This research raises the possibility that we could take a<br>
patient's own cells, rejuvenate them, then modify the cells as<br>
needed and give them back to the patient to treat a variety of<br>
genetic and other diseases,'' Dr. Woodring Wright, a professor<br>
of cell biology at the University of Texas in Dallas, said in a<br>
statement.<br>
Wright and colleagues at the university's Southwestern<br>
Medical Center, who worked with Geron, used an enzyme known as<br>
telomerase. Produced by germ cells such as eggs and sperm, it<br>
affects the ends of the chromosomes, or telomeres, which carry<br>
the genes.<br>
Normal cells do not produce telomerase. Every time a cell<br>
divides it loses a little bit of the telomere on either end of<br>
the chromosome. Wright's team found a way to make the telomeres<br>
grow back using the enzyme.<br>
``Each time a cell divides its telomeres get shorter and<br>
shorter and shorter,'' Wright said in a telephone interview. His<br>
team proved last year this loss was associated with aging.<br>
Now, they said, they proved you can stop the aging process,<br>
at least on a cellular level.<br>
``Unequivocally I would say this would not allow you to live<br>
forever,'' Wright said. ``This is not going to be a pill that<br>
allows you to live longer any time soon.''<br>
He said the the natural process that kills off cells was<br>
just one component of aging. ``It's possible that just like when<br>
you have a car and at 80,000 miles you replace the engine -- you<br>
haven't made that car immortal. On average the car is going to<br>
run longer but then the transmission is going to go out or the<br>
brakes or something else.''<br>
But the finding could help individual cells live much<br>
longer. ``There will be many important immediate medical<br>
applications and biotechnology applications and marvelous<br>
research applications,'' Wright said.<br>
'`Over time we hope this will have significant effects on<br>
the health span and eventually on lifespan.''<br>
Wright's team used skin cells, cells from the retina in the<br>
eye and skins from inside arteries. All were able to grow back<br>
their telomeres and did not, as normal cells do, eventually stop<br>
dividing and die.<br>
``They are still dividing,'' Wright said.<br>
This meant there could be very quick treatments for macular<br>
degeneration, a very common cause of blindness, for skin damage<br>
caused by burns and for atherosclerosis, the furring up of the<br>
arteries that causes heart disease.<br>
'`I think the medical implications of this work are really<br>
profound,'' agreed Dr. Jerry Shay, who worked with Wright. ``It<br>
will allow us now to take a person's own cells, manipulate and<br>
rejuvenate them without using up their own lifespan, and then<br>
re-inject them.''<br>
In other words, it could be the break that gene therapists<br>
have been looking for.<br>
``In terms of the use of human cells, it will totally<br>
transform genetic engineering,'' Wright said.<br>
Gene therapy involves taking the cells of a person with a<br>
genetic disease such as cystic fibrosis, inserting the healthy<br>
gene and then putting the cells back in the patient in the hope<br>
that the manipulated cells will take over.<br>
But the engineered cells are old by the time the scientists<br>
are through with them and often die off before they can do much<br>
good. Wright hopes the telomerase process can make the cells<br>
immortal and make them work better.<br>
There are also implications for cancer. Several mutations<br>
are needed for a cell to become cancerous, and one of them is<br>
turning back on the telomerase gene. Perhaps turning it off<br>
could help cure cancer patients without harming their healthy<br>
body cells, Wright said.<br>

Another piece of 'great' news<br>
if they are going to ban cloning , well live long enough so<br>
that the prevailing wisdom changes .... hee hee .<br>
Seriously, if the telomerase process can be somehow implanted<br>
back or incorporated genetically from the start of conception of<br>
a new living organism ... hey hey hey<br>
At least , aging has been show to be overcomed on a cellular<br>
level , how much more work , do you guys see needs to be done ?<br>

Nothing worth doing is completed in our lifetime; <br>
therefore we must be saved by hope.<br>
Nothing true or beautiful or good makes sense in any immediate <br>
historical context; therefore we must be saved by faith. <br>
Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone;<br>
therefore we are saved by love. <br>
