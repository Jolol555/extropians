In early 1997 It became clear to me that my children needed<br>
an explanation for their fathers weird beliefs.  My youngest son<br>
came to me one day with a plaintiff look on his face and asked. <br>
"Dad, why aren't we christian anymore?" In his mind he equated<br>
being a christian with going to church.<br>
<p>
I stammered a bit then tried to explain that I wanted him to<br>
search for truth with all his heart and mind, and use the time<br>
life had given him to make a better world for those who follow.<br>
To do that effectively he would have to utilize his intelligence<br>
and not allow others to define truth for him.  I clearly lost him <br>
in the translation.  (his attention span timed out)<br>
<p>
I have four very bright children (and do not anticipate contributing<br>
further to the gene pool), all of them impress me daily with their<br>
intelligence.  We are very close, more so than most.  Since they<br>
first learned to comprehend whole sentences, we've been playing a game.<br>
We call it talking.  We gather at the table or sometimes on the carpet.  <br>
One of them brings up a mystery...anything they don't understand.<br>
Then we have a free-for-all brainstorming session on the problem.<br>
We have together solved (....well not really) puzzles ranging from<br>
time travel to "If Methuselah was so darn good why did he drown in<br>
the flood."<br>
<p>
As a result of his question I began a diary which came to be called<br>
the Blue Book for no other reason than pure chance.  The first <br>
draft was stored on a blue floppy disc.  My idea was to develop<br>
a little life-guide and have a few copies made up, so they could<br>
read it when I'm toothless and senile.  Perhaps then they would<br>
understand what their Dad was trying to tell them.<br>
<p>
As they are all critical thinkers, I am sure they will end<br>
up with as much awe and wonder as I feel towards science and <br>
engineering.  My hope was to give them a defined set of ethics<br>
and a reason for the same without resorting to pie in the sky,<br>
carrot and the stick (read religious) fairy tales.<br>
<p>
In January of 1998 I posted a portion of the text on Usenet.  To<br>
my delight, the response was overwhelmingly positive (although<br>
some accused me of being a Jim Jones type cultist).  Most wanted<br>
to read more.<br>
<p>
More importantly I discovered that my ideas were shared by<br>
many others.  A new friend asked me if I was a Transhumanist<br>
or a Extropian.  I had no idea what he meant.  My first<br>
thoughts in retrospect were probably off base.  I became angry<br>
that he would dare question the status of my sexuality or of my<br>
vision.  (I am pretty sure an extropian is also someone with<br>
Wall-Eyes)<br>
<p>
After a little searching I discovered that both of these groups,<br>
however unfortunate their choice of names, were very much like me.<br>
<p>
I had been calling myself a New-Realist (from Wild Palms) much<br>
to the chagrin of my religiously impaired friends.  So I guess now<br>
I really am a STRAIGHT Transhumanist, and an Extropian with<br>
good vision.<br>
