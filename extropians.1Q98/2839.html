<i>&gt; &gt; Here's a wacky idea:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Suppose we've already got a couple of dozen asteroids captured, orbiting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Earth somewhere outside geosynch.  If the motors that put them there</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; haven't been dismantled, could one of these rocks be shifted into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; path of a killer comet, to deflect it and/or break it up?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Comets have random jettings of gas, which causes their courses to be rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; erratic. A large lumbering asteroid being driven by a small mass driver would</i><br>
<i>&gt; not have the capability. However, if we captured some comets, and kept the</i><br>
<i>&gt; comets sheilded in earth orbit, then we could use the comets mass (the ices</i><br>
<i>&gt; being much more volatile than rock) for much more rapid maneuvering.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
OK, why not keep a bunch of caputred, paired asteroids? each pair<br>
will be coupled by cable and spun about their common center of mass.<br>
you can spin the pair up using mass drivers or ion engines. When a<br>
comet is detected, simply pick an asteroid and cut the cable at the<br>
proper point. This will launch an asteroid on a trajectory to intercapt<br>
the comet. (Please be careful to compute the trajectory of the other<br>
member of the pair!)<br>
<p>
Recall the statistics: about 90 percent of the danger is from NEO asteroids.<br>
the remaining 10 percent is from comets. We have the technology to<br>
find and deflect NEO asteroids already, because they come from a<br>
fairly near and bounded space that can be completely searched, and because<br>
we will generally have years or decades to take corrective action.<br>
<p>
Comet detection is a lot harder, and deflection is harder still. Detection is<br>
harder because the space in unbounded, and detection must occur on the<br>
incoming impact trajetory. By contrast, NEO detection may occur on<br>
any previous orbit. deflection is harder because the response must be<br>
immediate (unually less thatn one year), and because you have to<br>
intercept. It's not feasible to macth orbits and use the comet's mass.<br>
<p>
So, a $10M/year program would probably let us find essentially all<br>
dangerous NEO asteroids in about 3 years, and a $1M/year continuing<br>
prpgram would probably keep the NEO census current. This should<br>
fund a few small (1 meter) 'scopes.<br>
<p>
By contrast, I speculate (NO data!) that we will need a $100M/year<br>
continuing program to look for comets. Basically , you need lots of<br>
big scopes to maintain a full comet sky survey.<br>
<p>
Bottom line: I think we should immediately fund the NEO survey using<br>
exiting technology. This has a very high return on investment.<br>
I think we need to figure out a cheaper way to do a comet<br>
survey rather than attempting to use current technology immediately.<br>
