<i>&gt; everyone else.  Although, when I'm psychotically manic (which doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; happen very often), my personality(ies) gets extremely warped, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; result chooses to do things I would not and often wish I did not when I</i><br>
<i>&gt; return to "normal".  I have no problem with the idea of someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; restraining me when I am psychotic and ignoring "my" desire to make my</i><br>
<i>&gt; own choices.  But I do have a problem with the idea of others</i><br>
<i>&gt; constraining my choices when I am capable of choosing rationally (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; is most of the time), simply because I am labeled "mentally ill".  Just</i><br>
<i>&gt; because one is "mentally ill" doesn't mean they should be treated like</i><br>
<i>&gt; children are.  Sometimes they should be, but each case is different and</i><br>
<i>&gt; must be evaluated separately.</i><br>
I couldn't agree more. By mentally ill I meant those who are permanently<br>
deranged/those in the midst of a fit, not people who are otherwise perfectly<br>
sane but are classified as "mentally ill" by bureaucrats. I suffer from mild<br>
depressions myself every now and then, but this can (sometimes) be alleviated <br>
by smoking cannabis; the worse I feel, the better the effect. Usually, a single<br>
hit does the trick, maybe because if replenishes an acute shortage of<br>
the body's "natural" THC variant. Also it allows you to look at problems in<br>
an emotionally detached fashion (or more precisely: you can think about<br>
a traumatic event while feeling quite happy &amp; lighthearted, an interesting<br>
experience). It's a primitive way of hedonistic engineering (but probably not <br>
recommendable if you suffer from a serious mental disorder, which it could <br>
make worse, although one can never know for sure).<br>
<p>
Btw, carnitine also has some anti-depressant-like effects, probably because<br>
it boosts your energy levels (more testosterone). I'll be doing a carnitine-DHEA<br>
combination therapy soon, this might have some interesting results. Has <br>
anyone else tried this?<br>
