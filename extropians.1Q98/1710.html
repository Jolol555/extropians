                    ~~~  The COBAL Programmer  ~~~<br>
I hope you've not heard this before ....<br>
anyway what's the point .... just re-surfacing ....<br>
<p>
Jack was once a COBOL programmer in the late 1990's who<br>
(after years of being taken for granted and treated as a<br>
technological dinosaur by all the UNIX programmers and<br>
Client/Server programmers and website developers, etc.)<br>
was finally getting some respect.<br>
<p>
You see,  he'd become a private consultant specializing in<br>
Year 2000 conversions.  He was working short-term<br>
assignments for<br>
prestige companies, traveling all over the world on different<br>
assignments.  He was working 70 and 80 and even 90 hour<br>
weeks, but it was worth it.<br>
<p>
However, several years of this relentless, mind-numbing<br>
work had taken its toll on Jack.  He had problems sleeping<br>
and began having anxiety dreams about the Year 2000.  It<br>
had reached a point where even the thought of the year 2000<br>
made him nearly violent.  He must have suffered some sort<br>
of breakdown, because all he could think about was how he<br>
could avoid the year 2000 and all that came with it.<br>
<p>
By the end of 1997 Jack decided to contact a company that<br>
specialized in cryogenics.  He made a deal to have himself<br>
frozen until 2001 through their totally automated (and very<br>
expensive) process.  He was thrilled.  The next thing he<br>
would know is he'd wake up in the year 2001; after the New<br>
Year celebrations and<br>
computer debacles; after the leap year, and the dust had<br>
settled.<br>
Nothing else to worry about except getting on with his life.<br>
<p>
He was put into his cryogenic receptacle, the technicians<br>
set the<br>
revive date, he was given injections to slow his heartbeat<br>
to a bare<br>
 minimum, and that was that.<br>
<p>
The next thing that Jack saw was an enormous and very<br>
modern room filled with excited people.  They were all<br>
shouting "I can't believe  it!" and "It's a miracle" and<br>
"He's alive!".  There were<br>
cameras (unlike any he'd ever seen) and equipment that<br>
looked like<br>
it came out of a science fiction movie.<br>
<p>
Someone who was obviously a spokesperson for the group<br>
stepped<br>
 forward. Jack couldn't contain his enthusiasm.  "It is<br>
over?" he<br>
 asked.  "Is 2001 already here?  Are all the millennial<br>
parties and<br>
 promotions and crises all over and done with?"<br>
<p>
The spokesman explained that there had been a problem<br>
with the programming of the timer on Jack's cryogenic<br>
receptacle, it<br>
hadn't been year 2000 compliant.  It was actually 8,000 years<br>
later, not the year 2001.  But the spokesman told Jack that<br>
he shouldn't get excited; someone important wanted to speak<br>
to him.<br>
<p>
Suddenly a wall-sized projection screen displayed the image<br>
of a<br>
 man that had a striking resemblance to Bill Gates.  This<br>
man was Prime Minister of Earth.  He told Jack not to be<br>
upset.  That<br>
this was a wonderful time to be alive.  That there was<br>
world peace and no more starvation.  That the space program<br>
had been reinstated and there were colonies on the moon and<br>
on Mars.  That technology had advanced to such a degree<br>
that everyone had virtual reality interfaces which allowed<br>
them to contact anyone else on the planet, or to watch any<br>
entertainment, or to hear any music recorded anywhere.<br>
<p>
"That sounds terrific," said Jack. "But I'm curious. Why is<br>
everybody so interested in me?"<br>
<p>
"Well," said the Prime Minister.  "The year 10000 is<br>
just around the corner, and it says in your files that you<br>
know<br>
COBOL..."<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
