                          <br>
<p>
I live in Miami Florida and I've talked to Cubans every day of my life for  <br>
years, not thousands but MILLIONS of Cubans live here. Out of all those  <br>
millions there must be one that doesn't hate Castro, but I've yet to find him. <br>
Without a single exception in my experience, they hate Castro with an  <br>
intensity I can't fully relate to. I've not had as difficult a life as these  <br>
poor people and I don't hate anyone or anything as strongly as they hate  <br>
Castro.<br>
<p>
By the way, what on Earth were you trying to get at when you said  <br>
"perceived, at least"?               <br>
        <br>
<i>         &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>         &gt;&gt;Castro did not inherit a poor country, in 1959 it had the third         </i><br>

<i>         &gt;&gt;and Canada were higher. </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I would love to see some reference for that interesting bit of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;information, or preferably ten.</i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Then look up a encyclopedia or almanac from 1959, if you want 9 more then <br>
look up 9 more.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;The fact that for a few days in 1962 Castro brought the human race         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;closer to the brink of extinction than anytime in the last ten         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;thousand years does not increase my admiration of him.                     </i><br>
<i>        &gt;I never really understood the problem in there.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The problem was global extinction. The USSR withdrew its nuclear missiles <br>
from Cuba over the strong objection of Castro. Neither side can find much to <br>
brag about in their nuclear policy but the fact remains, if the USSR had done <br>
what Castro was urging them to do there would have been a nuclear war, and<br>
we wouldn't be having this pleasant conversation today, not just because <br>
there wouldn't be an Internet, but because there wouldn't be a you and there <br>
wouldn't be a me.                  <br>
<p>
During the crisis most of the president's advisers, including all the <br>
military ones, were urging the President not to wait and to take action <br>
immediately. For example, Chief of the U.S Air Force, General Curtis LeMay <br>
(a VERY scary man) and the head of the Strategic Air Command, Thomas Powers <br>
(even LeMay called him a sadist) told the president that if we didn't order <br>
the missile sites in Cuba bombed within the hour it would be a blot on the <br>
honor of the U.S.A. Kennedy asked LeMay what he thought the Soviets would do <br>
if he did that. LeMay said he understood how the soviets think and because <br>
such an attack would be bound to kill lots of Russians manning the site they <br>
couldn't let it pass, he said they would probably retaliate by bombing our<br>
medium range nuclear missiles in Turkey. Kennedy asked what we should do then, <br>
LeMay said such an attack would kill American solders and that would have to <br>
be avenged by bombing nuclear missile sites in the USSR itself. Kennedy asked <br>
what the Soviets would do then, LeMay said he hoped at that point cooler <br>
heads would prevail.<br>
<p>
Actually it was even worse than that. We now know from recently declassified <br>
USSR archives that the nuclear missiles in Cuba were fully operational in <br>
October 1962 and that the Russian field commanders were authorized to fire <br>
them on their own authority if it looked like the missiles were about to be<br>
destroyed or captured. The field commanders had the launch codes! Castro<br>
knew this, Kennedy did not.<br>
           <br>
The USA thought incorrectly that the missiles were not yet operational and <br>
they never dreamed they could be fired without a direct order from Moscow. <br>
We also know that the USA was absolutely determined to get rid of the missiles <br>
one way or another, if they were not removed by diplomacy in a matter of days <br>
they would send an air strike to destroy them. As I said, the human race <br>
never came closer to extinction.<br>
<p>
I don't often say nice things about Communist dictators but I will now,   <br>
Khrushchev had the intelligence to see the insanity in the situation and had   <br>
the guts to back down. Castro was absolutely furious at Khrushchev's decision   <br>
to remove the missiles and never forgave him for it. Khrushchev often made<br>
bloodthirsty speeches but he really didn't want to be a mass murderer on such  <br>
a vast scale, but Castro would rather destroy the world than be embarrassed.   <br>
If Castro was the dictator of the USSR and not Cuba, you and I and everyone   <br>
we know would be dead.                            <br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Didn't (or doesn't) the US have nuclear weapons pointed at Cuba? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't know, it's top secret, but I doubt it, there's nothing important in  <br>
Cuba anymore, not militarily or economically or scientifically or <br>
artistically or...<br>
       <br>

<i>        &gt;&gt;Anarcho-socialists, is that anything like jumbo shrimp?                  </i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;Not a government but an entity which is designated by some method by         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the voluntary members of the group or commune which the entity is         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;going to direct.  </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
I don't know what you mean by "entity" and I don't know how it's "designated" <br>
or who does it, but I think I do know what you mean by "voluntary", join us <br>
or take a bullet in the brain, you're free to choose.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Anarcho-capitalism is just a special case of this by setting group         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;is equal to each indivual.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
A government is an organization that claims a monopoly on the legal use of <br>
force and has the power to enforce its claim most of the time. In  <br>
Anarcho-capitalism no group has rights an individual does not have. So what <br>
the hell are Anarcho-socialists?<br>
<p>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;In the common case, the commune is a group of people that choose to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;live together, and the entity that directs them are the people         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;themselves, and usually they don't do any enforcing since there is         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;nothing to enforce cos most private property is abolished.  </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Fine, you have a perfect right to do that and I have not the slightest  <br>
objection. I presume everyone on this list believes in the Scientific Method, <br>
so let's put it to the test, start your socialist commune today, I'll stick <br>
with business, and we'll see which one turns out to be freer and more <br>
prosperous. I have no desire to stop you, and anyway I have a pretty good <br>
idea which one of us will win the contest, but by all means, try to prove me <br>
wrong. If you do then you will have beaten me fair and square in the free <br>
market of ideas.<br>
<p>
I get the impression that our positions are not symmetric however, that you  <br>
do have a strong desire to stop me. If I'm wrong about that then I apologize <br>
and we have no disagreement over morality, only over the technical points of  <br>
economics, and there is no need to worry about that, nature will let us know <br>
which one of us is correct, no doubt about it. <br>

If you believe that then you don't understand what the Extropian list is all <br>
about.    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The politics of cultural arguments are IMHO not resolvable.         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Personal preferences is not resolvable, but that's OK, I have no wish to <br>
resolve them, economic prosperity on the other hand is objective.<br>

<i>        &gt;there was rich, middle class and poor. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well of course you're completely correct. Communism can't make poor people <br>
rich but it can make rich people poor. What puzzles me is why you think <br>
that's a virtue.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The people I spoke with do not hate Castro per se, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If I was a Cuban in Cuba and a foreigner asked me what I thought of Castro <br>
I'd say he was the best thing since sliced bread. My momma didn't rase no <br>
dummies.    <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The ones I spoke with blame the US embargo </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
The US embargo is certainly part of Cuba's problem, another part is that <br>
Castro was not smart enough to figure that out. Going out of your way to  <br>
antagonize you main customer, the largest economic power in the world and <br>
only 90 miles away, is not the ticket to prosperity, unfortunately for the <br>
Cuban people Castro's IQ is only room temperature so all this came as a big<br>
surprise to him.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, the US embargo (which I oppose) performs an invaluable <br>
service for Castro, every dictator needs a scapegoat to explain failure,  <br>
Hitler had the Jews and Castro has the embargo.        <br>
