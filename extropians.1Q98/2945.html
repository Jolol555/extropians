Of course the US did this mostly out of self-interest but at least they did<br>
something, which is more than can be said for the European governements. In<br>
the role of butt-kicking policeman they are still needed to cleanup messes<br>
like Bosnia that European politicians, to their great shame, allowed to<br>
exist for several years on in their backyard.<br>
<p>
At this point in History the US is the only nation in the world that<br>
combines sufficient military power and the kind of centralisation required<br>
to be able to react to a thing like Bosnia or the Gulf. Europe could of<br>
course, technically speaking, but lacks organisation and guts (mostly the<br>
latter).<br>
<p>
This irritates the hell out of me.<br>

<i> &gt;In a century where europeans and asians heralded the end of the age of</i><br>
<i> &gt;the individual, and the advent of the collective,</i><br>
<p>
???<br>
You won't find religious fanatics blocking woman's clinics in europe, it is<br>
only in the US that groups of people are allowed to try to violate such<br>
individual rights.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;We have successfully purged the welfare state from our</i><br>
<i> &gt;federal system, and most of our state governments.</i><br>
<p>
Did you know that the US is one of the few 1st world countries in the world<br>
were parkinson's disease is significantly lower among blacks and other<br>
minority groups? Regrettably this is not because blacks in the US don't get<br>
parkinson, it is because often they don't get treated and thus do not show<br>
up in the statistics. Quite a feat for the most powerful mation in the<br>
world today.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Other nations that have followed suit now enjoy stronger economies </i><br>
<i> &gt;than their stagnant socialist neighbors.</i><br>
<p>
We have been over this before but maybe it did not register or something,<br>
the above sentence is abosulute and total B.S. (tough but that's what it is).<br>
European countries with the most extensive welfare systems like Germany and<br>
the Netherlands are the strongest economies on the continent. And our<br>
currency is a hell of a lot more stable than the US $.<br>
<p>
Instead of believing that a welfaresystem necessarily leads to economic<br>
collapse or something why don't you prove it? And don't just use France or<br>
some former East-block nations as an example. The fact that a welfare<br>
system is impossible to implement in the US without all kinds of bad<br>
side-effects only tells us something about US-society. The _fact_ that<br>
there are countries in this world that have the combination of a very<br>
healty economy and a extensive welfare system shows that it is possible,<br>
given competent leadership, organisation and a sense mutual responsibility.<br>
<p>
There are more ways to Rome and we happen to like this one.<br>
<p>
The point is that the US has been good at technical innovation and<br>
containment of aggressors. But that does not mean that US policy makers<br>
can't learn from other countries. US drug policy is still very stupid and<br>
outdated and _many_ US citizens are suffering because of this. Instead of<br>
just saying that America is doing so great maybe it would be smart to<br>
listen to others and learn from their succes stories.<br>
<p>
