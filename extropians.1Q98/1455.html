<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;sane, consensual, equal.  Pedophiliac sexual relationships do not fit</i><br>
<i>&gt;the basic critria and often depend on the emotional or</i><br>
<i>&gt;physical vulnerability of one individual.  (Note that B/D/S/M</i><br>
<i>&gt;enthusiasts and polygamists have no trouble fulfilling these</i><br>
<i>&gt;criteria).  Indeed, these relationships bear a strong resemblence to </i><br>
<i>&gt;early forms of marriage that depended upon the female remaining </i><br>
<i>&gt;ignorant, dependant and infantile.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As puberty begins to occur at earlier ages in humans, the age of</i><br>

<i>&gt;years of waiting can't hurt!</i><br>

Paedophiliac behaviour is a great egoism, since children,<br>
in general, do not have the minimum counscious sense of what she/he is<br>
really doing...<br>
For this, he/she is named "minor"... And, worse, lots of times a child who<br>
had sexual relations with adults,<br>
when grows up, will possibly have psycho problems...<br>
<p>
If individuals do not educate their instincts, mankind will walk to a<br>
high-tech paleozoic  era...<br>
