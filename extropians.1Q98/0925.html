In a private message, I had asked Sherman Wilcox about possible sex<br>
differences, as are found following unilateral brain trauma with<br>
spoken language, in signed language.  He replied:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't know that there are enough sign aphasics to allow us to</i><br>
<i>&gt;come to useful conclusions about M/F differences. Maybe it has been</i><br>
<i>&gt;studied. And  I think there are some studies of late learners.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Again, it's not my area, but I can just envision that there are some</i><br>
<i>&gt;pretty big factors that are different enough that it makes it hard</i><br>
<i>&gt;to do decent comparisons.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For example, what about age of deafness. Or, how early was ASL</i><br>
<i>&gt;acquired (since about 90% of deaf children have hearing parents who</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't sign, the whole question of "native" language is skewed). Or</i><br>
<i>&gt;this one. One of the most famous cases in the Poizner et al study</i><br>
<i>&gt;is of this very old (now dead) deaf man. Though he gets reported as</i><br>
<i>&gt;"L" or something like that, lots of people knew who he was -- he</i><br>
<i>&gt;was a pretty famous leader in the deaf community who spent lots of</i><br>
<i>&gt;his life at Gallaudet University.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Poizner et al report that he lost his grammatical abilities in ASL</i><br>
<i>&gt;as a result of his aphasia. Because he was a respected leader, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;deaf, and a signer, people *assume* that he signed what we now call</i><br>
<i>&gt;ASL. But I know of at least one other deaf person, also a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;respected person, who says that this guy, while he was eloquent,</i><br>
<i>&gt;never really used ASL. But to understand what this means you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;to know about signing styles of older people, educational practices</i><br>
<i>&gt;from 60 years ago, etc. Add to this the fact that this guy was born</i><br>
<i>&gt;hearing, and in Russia (I believe), and probably did learn Russian</i><br>
<i>&gt;before he went deaf and moved here (where he surely learned English</i><br>
<i>&gt;quite well). It's a mess!</i><br>
<p>
I still think that it might be interesting to know if, whether or not<br>
sign was the primary language, there are differences in<br>
lateralization of function in male and female signers, and whether<br>
males suffer more from left hemispere trauma than females, along with<br>
the associated sex difference in recovery of function.  Anyone?<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
