<i>&gt;Helping paraplegics to walk</i><br>

<i>&gt;Scientists work on device that would bypass spinal cord</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By Charlene Laino</i><br>
<i>&gt;MSNBC</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;PHILADELPHIA, Feb 17 — A small device implanted in the brain that sends</i><br>
<i>&gt;signals to the arms and legs, bypassing the spinal cord, may soon allow</i><br>
<i>&gt;paraplegics to walk. A patient would only have to think, “I would like to</i><br>
<i>&gt;move my leg forward,” and the device would do the rest, a California</i><br>
<i>&gt;researcher said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        </i><br>
<i>&gt;    </i><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;    </i><br>
<i>&gt;From:   <a href="http://msnbc.com/news/144413.asp">http://msnbc.com/news/144413.asp</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "On the Cutting Edge" front page</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         THE DEVICE, which would look rather like the head of a toothbrush</i><br>
<i>&gt;— a mount with electrodes as its bristles — would work similarly to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;cellular phone, sending signals to other electrodes implanted in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;patient’s nerves or muscles.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       A new understanding of brain circuitry is allowing scientist to</i><br>
<i>&gt;develop the device, said Dr. Richard Andersen of the California Institute</i><br>
<i>&gt;of Technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Similar prostheses are already being used to help people who are</i><br>
<i>&gt;deaf, he said. By stimulating different auditory nerves, the smart brains</i><br>
<i>&gt;are helping patients to lip-read more easily.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       The new device for paraplegics is growing out of Andersen’s work on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the physical organization of the brain.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Using imaging scans called MRIs to record blood flow in the brain of</i><br>
<i>&gt;monkeys, Andersen pinpointed the part of the brain that codes for</i><br>
<i>&gt;intentions. In contrast to previous beliefs, he found that movement and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;intention to perform a movement are controlled by different parts of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;brain.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       To make sure human brains work the same way, his team then tried the</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiment on themselves, hooking themselves up to brain tracing devices</i><br>
<i>&gt;and MRIs. When they only moved their eyes, they were able to detect an eye</i><br>
<i>&gt;movement area — signaling intention — in one particular region of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;brain, he said. Similarly, when they reached their arms out, they found an</i><br>
<i>&gt;area in the brain that corresponded to the intention to move their arm.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       That’s what gave them the idea for the brain prostheses for people</i><br>
<i>&gt;with spinal cord injuries, Andersen said at a scientific meeting here.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       As the California researcher envisions it, a 6mm by 3mm array of</i><br>
<i>&gt;electrodes about the width of human hair would be implanted under the</i><br>
<i>&gt;brain’s surface. The wires, which are attached to a transmitter, would send</i><br>
<i>&gt;radio-type signals to other electrodes implanted in the muscles and nerves</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the arms or legs. Normally, the spinal cord carries such signals from</i><br>
<i>&gt;the brain to the rest of the body.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       “We’re only talking about crude movements,” Andersen said, but it’s</i><br>
<i>&gt;better than any system that has been developed to date.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Animal tests are about to begin, with human testing just years off.</i><br>
<i>&gt;“We’re over all the major hurdles,” Andersen said, explaining that the time</i><br>
<i>&gt;is needed for development.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       The prostheses are being developed in conjunction with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Huntington Memorial Research Institute in Pasadena.</i><br>
