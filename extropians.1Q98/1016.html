Apropos the war-against-god movie idea, I'm working on a atheistic<br>
fantasy setting for my roleplaying group. The gods, who were rather<br>
troublesome ("Worship, or I'll smite thee!"), were *assassinated* by a<br>
group of clever philosophers who tricked them into accepting a<br>
poisoned blood-sacrifice. The death of the gods wrecked the world<br>
(things like the sun crashing down into the sea, continents were<br>
tilted and apocalyptic similar stuff), but after a few centuries new<br>
civilizations have sprung up in a world which is completely god-free:<br>
there is no point with religions, since everybody *knows* the gods are<br>
dead. Instead of religion philosophy has become the major memetic<br>
force, influencing the politics of the various city-states deeply. It<br>
is a bit like the Italian renaissance/4th century BC Greece. A major<br>
theme is the struggle between reason (represented by the philosophers)<br>
and irrationalism (represented by the dragons). I call the setting<br>
"Philosophers &amp; Dragons" :-)<br>

<i>&gt; The check is in the post.  Here's some other sci-fi themes ticking</i><br>
<i>&gt; over in my mind:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An uploaded universe ruled by a "Reality Council" who decides what's</i><br>
<i>&gt; real and what's not, young hopefuls struggle to make it up the</i><br>
<i>&gt; political ladder so that they can reap the benefits of being able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; pass "Reality Legislation." </i><br>
<p>
:-) Reminds me a bit of the ideological conflicts between the<br>
different poli in Egan's _Diaspora_: one regards physical reality as<br>
boring and trivial, while another thinks it is dangerous to forget it<br>
and our ties to it. In a third objects in the virtual reality can all<br>
interpenetrate, since it would be coersion to block passage.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Androids that don't want to be human.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An upload who downloads into a human body and is overwhelmed by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; shear lack of substance in the real world.</i><br>
<p>
Yay!<br>
