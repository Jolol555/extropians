<i>&gt; From:          DOUG.BAILEY@ey.com</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Scarcity in an MNT Future</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Several people have stated that they believe that capitalism will go the way of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the do-do in the future.  Often a fully realized molecular nanotechnology (MNT)</i><br>
<i>&gt; is cited as a reason for this predicted death of capitalism.  I do not think we</i><br>
<i>&gt; should dismiss capitalism in such a simple fashion.  A MNT future where</i><br>
<i>&gt; production is virtually free and the supply for such resources is virtually</i><br>
<i>&gt; limitless is beguiling.  I can understand why people, even using my definition</i><br>
<i>&gt; of "scarcity" above, could assert that such scarcity would no longer exist</i><br>
<i>&gt; since demand could easily exceed supply.  I submit that the one commodity</i><br>
<i>&gt; (scarce resource) in a MNT future would be MNT itself.  The only real</i><br>
<i>&gt; "object"/"process" with value would be the ability to produce with MNT.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; crucial question becomes would the supply of MNT exceed the demand for it?</i><br>
<p>
This doesn't matter because there is one resource that will always be <br>
in short supply, that MNT can't do a thing about.<br>
<p>
That resource is creativity.<br>
<p>
And to pay for creativity, another resource which can already be <br>
produced in very large quantities with essentially no resource input <br>
but which, it appears, we will also never have enough of:<br>
<p>
respect.<br>
