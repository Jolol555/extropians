        The most beautiful aspect (and often the most infuriating) of<br>
mythology is that each myth can be looked at in a variety of ways.  It<br>
seems that any myth a person would use to dissuade another's notion of<br>
immortality<br>
or trans-human ascension could also be used to promote it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The Tithonus story, for example, shows that just immortality isn't what we</i><br>
<i>&gt;want, we want eternal youth (plus it contains a clear example of why one</i><br>
<i>&gt;should think through one's wishes carefully before implementing them).</i><br>
<p>
        Well, as the myth goes, it wasn't exactly Tithonus' choice to become<br>
an atrophied immortal; rather, it was Aurora who "stole him away" and<br>
pleaded with Jupiter to grant him this immortality.  This prompts the<br>
question: had Tithonus had a choice in the matter, would he have complied<br>
with the prospect of immortality?  Another question prompted by this<br>
particular myth is this: if Aurora had such an immense fascination with<br>
mortality and immortality, why didn't she simply choose another mortal to<br>
make immortal --this time with eternal youth?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Many of the other anti-hubris stories aren't really about the futility</i><br>
<i>&gt;of hubris, but rather of the form "look out for the Powers That Be,</i><br>
<i>&gt;they don't like competition", i.e. hubris works perfectly well, but be</i><br>
<i>&gt;prepared that some people will try to stop you.</i><br>
<p>
        This is wholly indicative of the mindset of the cultures which<br>
created and conveyed these myths...that is why it is important to look at<br>
the figures in question before their ultimate demise --the focus on "what<br>
could have been" as opposed to what was. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Prometheus, for example, clearly knew that the gods would punish him for</i><br>
<i>&gt;his deed but accepted that and still went along with his plan (besides, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;an immortal titan a few millennia of agony before a remote relative</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Hercules) frees him might be a rather small piece to pay for giving</i><br>
<i>&gt;fire to the humans).</i><br>
<p>
        Another perspective that can be taken on the Prometheus myth is a<br>
focus on why Zeus felt it necessary to punish Prometheus.  Was Zeus just a<br>
greedy god, or did he want the human race to find the fire on their own...<br>
without divine intervention?  I think that this is an important way of<br>
looking at the myth.  Perhaps Zeus felt that if Prometheus was to give the<br>
fire to humanity, humans would constantly be thanking the gods for the gift<br>
rather than finding things on their own.  Needless to say, reason plays an<br>
immensely important part in mythology; however, as the "crackpot" scale<br>
indicates, the pure mutability of mythology makes it impossible for anyone<br>
to treat myth as though it were fact...it simply makes one think about the<br>
reasons and consequences for one's actions.<br>
