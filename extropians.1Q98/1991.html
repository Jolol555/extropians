Hi Extropians,<br>
<p>
<p>
I'm new here. I've decided this issue will be my first 'jump' into a<br>
transhuman discussion. I've been lurking about for a while.<br>
<p>
<p>
This subject seems to contain some curious facets to me. :-)<br>
<p>
<p>
The term 'mind' as used in the various arguments appears very squishy to<br>
me. If indeed &lt;bold&gt;memory stores&lt;/bold&gt; exist within the geographic<br>
substance of the brain/body in a manner analogous to a computer hard<br>
drive, then solving software/hardware issues would seem a fairly straight<br>
forward physics problem. Once solved, copies of stored memories could be<br>
duplicated in a familiar manner. The result would likely resemble a<br>
computer based autobiography. Of course just moving memories about<br>
doesn't seem to me to address the identity issue. We'd have to also<br>
transfer decision making abilities, response patterns, beliefs and etc.<br>
One difficulty I'm considering here centers about the remote sensory<br>
sites geographically located within the physical body such as the nerve<br>
endings in the skin, visual receptors, taste buds etc. We can pretty<br>
quickly notice that in responding to some strong stimulus in the physical<br>
world our bodies act as feedback mechanisms. We for instance<br>
&lt;bold&gt;experience &lt;/bold&gt;fear, anger, joy, love and etc. in many more<br>
places and in many more ways than simple intellectual algorithms. You may<br>
remember such an experience in detail and notice many physiological<br>
elements.=20<br>
<p>
<p>
Many of us have watched the pathos of 'Mr. Data' on Star Trek. His<br>
struggle to understand the responses of 'humans'. It appears to me that<br>
the 'human' manner of experiencing emotion in our bodies contributes<br>
significantly to our human abilites. The 'hunches' that lead to 'eureka'<br>
and facilitate discovery, breakthroughs and paradigm smashing don't seem<br>
to have a place within the algorithmic functioning of pure intellect. Do<br>
transhuman aspirations include leaving behind this 'sensory' or<br>
physiological aspect of continuing consciousness?<br>
<p>
<p>
Some may initially suppose that unemotional existance would be<br>
desireable. But so far I know of no examples, or models that suggest the<br>
human ability to 'jump' beyond logic to a 'break through' kind of event<br>
can be duplicated or simulated by simple number crunching. And medicine<br>
and/or science has not to the best of my knowledge been able to locate<br>
memory storage sites or consciousness locations within the bits and<br>
pieces of the body/brain. The tissue and fluids at best seem to exist as<br>
'processors' of information and response mechanisms, not the location of<br>
storage or the actual generaters of thought or action.<br>
<p>
<p>
So my thinking and experiences ask for more clarification about this<br>
uploading stuff. One of my grad school profs, many years ago, suggested<br>
that there existed an FM component about understanding our conscious<br>
functioning. FM here means F---ing Magic. We haven't yet found the<br>
location of 'ME'. Our mindbody so far seems to exist much more<br>
analogously to the Mars Rover ( remotely operated robot ) than to a<br>
self-contained sapient entity.<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;If &lt;/bold&gt;the Mars Rover analogy more accurately depicts our<br>
functional existance within this 4 (at least) deminsional timespace<br>
continuum then perhaps looking for a software/hardware solution to<br>
uploading consciousness to a new location is misdirected effort???<br>
Perhaps we might direct some effort towards identifying and interacting<br>
with the remote signal origin. This 'Houston Control Center' may already<br>
have the information that at some point we will need alternatives not<br>
apparent to us. Conversly they may &lt;bold&gt;not&lt;/bold&gt; have that information<br>
and expect us to send that information back to Headquarters so they may<br>
take action.=20<br>
<p>
<p>
I do not suggest this as a pun or in any 'spiritual' frame of reference.<br>
I simply think that the idea's I have seen so far on this list don't<br>
address the reality of science as I understand it today.=20<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;... IMHO, it cannot be resolved with our present knowledge...</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes. And perhaps because the search for &lt;italic&gt;whatever&lt;/italic&gt; has<br>
been directed off course?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;As you're uploading, and for the moment when the upload is completed,=20</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the copy IS you.  The nanosecond you have a dissimilar experience from</i><br>
the &gt;copy, you are separate entities.=20<br>
<p>
<p>
If we were able to transfer 'hard data' from one location (our body) to<br>
another (our clone body) the resulting transfer would likely create<br>
dis-belief for both 'individuals'.  Our experiential data recorder would<br>
not be recording the other sites data. Even going into the process aware<br>
that "I" was being uploaded "I" would not believe in the success if "I"<br>
could not access the experiences of the clone. Nor do I believe the clone<br>
could accept the 'sameness' of its origin. So now we have two individuals<br>
which want their continued existance... =20<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So in this case,  the "you" and "someone else" are both correct,</i><br>
depending on=20<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the time frame. =20</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I would change this statement to read "...the "you" and "someone else"<br>
are both confused..."<br>
<p>
<p>
But if our essence resides outside of a remotely controlled robot body<br>
duplicating reciever sites might create new issues. :-) Or if the control<br>
signal has a very tight focus perhaps not.<br>
<p>
<p>
For those who have made it this far, thanks for reading my wonderings and<br>
wanderings. I will be interested in different viewpoints.=20<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
