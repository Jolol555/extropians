<i>&gt;&gt;As Gurdjieff pointed-out, most individuals fail to be individuals. They</i><br>

<i>&gt;My question is this - which individuals do not fail to be individuals?  It </i><br>
<i>&gt;seems that all of us, populace and cognoscenti alike, are subject to the</i><br>
same <br>
<i>&gt;set of principles that govern our attitudes, beliefs and behaviors.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
If "principles" "govern," what kind of creatures are they<br>
and how do they "govern?"  Are they volitional entities<br>
with "invisable hands" that push around your "attitudes,<br>
beliefs and behaviors?"<br>

<i>&gt;My point - we can not exercise control over which memes take to our mind.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Whichever story I wind up buying on this or any other issue will have been </i><br>
<i>&gt;determined by the shape of my mind at the time I first consider it, which</i><br>
was <br>
<i>&gt;determined by the last million things I heard, etc, etc. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Maybe free will is an emergent property.  Maybe when<br>
a neural system achieves complexity beyond a certain<br>
threshhold, free will occurs or comes into being.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Don't believe me?  I've noticed a strong tendency for all memetically minded </i><br>
<i>&gt;thinkers to keep clinging to some notion of the metaphysical "I".  How can</i><br>
one <br>
<i>&gt;accept that all of our traits came to be the way that they are by the </i><br>
<i>&gt;evolution of genes and memes, and yet still think that somewhere 'in</i><br>
there' is <br>
<i>&gt;a "me" who is capable of exercising some control over the process?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Maybe the notion of "useful fiction" -- cf. Bentham<br>
('The Theory of Fictions'), Nietzsche, and Vaihinger<br>
('The Philosophy of As-If') -- can help here.  In the<br>
same way that we say, "It rains," knowing full well<br>
that there is no "it" that rains, some of us say,<br>
"I do this and that," while realizing that in reality<br>
there's no "I."  (The grammatical structure of English<br>
also results in some statements that reflect reality<br>
poorly.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To take a famous example, Richard Dawkins argues that humans can "rebel </i><br>
<i>&gt;against the tyranny of the selfish replicators."  He gives the example that </i><br>
<i>&gt;every time we use contraception, we are rebelling against the tyranny of</i><br>
genes <br>
<i>&gt;who want us to procreate.  But who is really rebelling in this example?  To </i><br>
<i>&gt;me, this seems like an case of the meme for contraception winning a big </i><br>
<i>&gt;victory in the battle for survival against certain genes.  But to</i><br>
hypothesize <br>
<i>&gt;a magical "self" that lurks around in our brains, deciding which memes and </i><br>
<i>&gt;which genes will exercise influence over our behaviors at which time is a</i><br>
joke <br>
<i>&gt;that no reflective thinker could suffer.          </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Will anyone argue differently?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I agree that there is no magical "self" or "I" in reality.<br>
However, in the same way that I can load a program called<br>
"I" into a computer, some complex brain circuitry could<br>
evolve and call itself "I."  And at some point this<br>
circuitry could achieve sufficient complexity to<br>
spontaneously produce the epiphenomenon of free will<br>
or volition.<br>
