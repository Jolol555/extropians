<i>&gt; From:          "Erik Moeller" &lt;flagg@oberberg-online.de&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Most people can't learn second languages very well. Besides, we _have_ a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;lingua franca already. While I never understood why they dropped Latin for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;frogspeak -- let's stick to English, it is a simple enough language.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's the most popular language, but that doesn't make it the ideal one. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know enough about Esperanto to like it, but as I dig into Japanese, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; find that it offers many advantages to other languages, with the drawback of</i><br>
<i>&gt; unnecessary politeness verbs. (It is, in many aspects, more simple than</i><br>
<i>&gt; English, you don't have to worry about pronouns so much.) It would be nice</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have a language which also represents a more liberal worldview towards</i><br>
<i>&gt; things. For example, I actually see little purpose in diferring between man</i><br>
<i>&gt; and woman. Some Newspeak, anyone?</i><br>
<p>
Don't forget that some languages have masculine, feminine, and <br>
neuter.  In German, for example, a teenage girl is neuter (obviously <br>
invented by a father with a good imagination and not much contact <br>
with reality).<br>
