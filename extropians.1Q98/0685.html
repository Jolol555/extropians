There had already been several unsuccessful attempts to immortalize non-human<br>
cells with telomerase.  It was their failure which made me become very<br>
skeptical of the telomerase theory.  I remain puzzled how telomerase could<br>
avert the chromosomal traslocations, fissions, and fusions characteristic<br>
of senescing cells and wonder if the human telomerase has regulatory <br>
functions as well as enzymatic ones.<br>
<p>
Beating senescence is much bigger news than Dolly.  Cloning doesn't change<br>
things too much, really; you can spread genes faster than with conventional<br>
breeding but it doesn't allow much of interest that you couldn't do anyway.<br>
Being able to grow "normal" cells in vitro indefinitely has all kinds of <br>
profound implications for research and organ replacement.  <br>
