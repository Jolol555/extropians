Yes.<br>

'Government' is defined by the people - even the most totalitarian of<br>
governments was and is defined by the people.  Free-market Capitalism<br>
is 'dynamic centralism' - although the point(s) of control may change<br>
far more quickly than other centralist systems, they still exist.  If<br>
you were to take a single moment in time of an FMC system, you would<br>
clearly see the consumer majority gathered around the supplier<br>
minority.  Currently we can't feel the collective benefit of our<br>
actions, so we've created capitalism.  With money you can immediately<br>
feel the benefit of anything you do.  However, the 'benefit' is<br>
centralist because it must be defined.<br>
<p>
A decentralised economy would be a network, which allowed the<br>
collective benefit of any action to be felt in real-time, with no<br>
centralised entity defining that benefit.  Soon information will be<br>
transmitted through an open network with enough speed to not require<br>
the need of a capitalist system to relay the benefits.  Physical<br>
things may take a while to catch up, but eventually we could have a<br>
100% decentralised economy.<br>
