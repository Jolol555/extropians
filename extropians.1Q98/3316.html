<p>
Not in the way you'd put it.  Most transhumanists I know aren't interested<br>
in paving over the earth or anything like that.  Rather, we value the<br>
environment for the good it will do for us.  (Where the "good" is usually<br>
human utility and/or complexity, extropy, longevity...)  What this means,<br>
however, is that the environnment is only extrinsically good; if the good<br>
which it might bring us is outweighed by the cost of preserving it, then I<br>
for one would not support its maintenance.<br>
<p>
The above seems a little harsh... but it's not quite as bad as it sounds.<br>
After all, supporting the environment is not an all-or-nothing decision.<br>
We might, for example, sue to keep our air free from soot and other<br>
particulates while remain negligent of CO2 emissions as not worth the<br>
effort.  This is especially true if you don't believe global warming is<br>
happening.  (Disbelieving in global warming is not anti-environmental: I<br>
may believe in environmentalism without believing in global cooling, for<br>
example.  [This was a big thing in the 70s and a significant reason why<br>
many of us are sceptical of global warming claims now.])<br>
<p>
Also, many of us believe that many environmental laws are extremely costly;<br>
so costly that they cannot ever pay for themselves.  I for one oppose such<br>
laws.<br>
