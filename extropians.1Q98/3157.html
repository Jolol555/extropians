<p>
Yes, investors LOVE safety nets; but for the wrong reasons.  Investors love<br>
safety nets because it means that even if their investments don't pay for<br>
themselves, the government will be there to fish them out again.  It's like<br>
walking into a casino and knowing that the games are fixed so you'll win<br>
every time.<br>
<p>
Such a policy of bailing out investors is not only fraudulent, but also bad<br>
for the economy.  Why make the people pay for some investor's lack of good<br>
judgement?  Sure, GOOD investment is good, but bad investment serves little<br>
useful economic purpose.<br>
<p>
As far as political stability, yes, you're right, this is also prized by<br>
investors.  Capitalists get scared if they think their privately owned<br>
property in other countries will be seized by the government or burned by<br>
rioting masses.<br>
<p>
If I understand your argument correctly, however, you're concerned that if<br>
(admittedly money-losing) welfare programs were NOT in place, violent<br>
revolution would result.  I am dubious of this argument...  if we take this<br>
argument to its logical conclusion then we must necessarily choose between<br>
a capitalist welfare state and socialism; we could never be, for example,<br>
libertarian, because any attempt to try it would be rejected in favor of<br>
something more authoritarian.<br>
<p>
If abandoning welfare DOES happen to turn out to be best for the people, I<br>
for one have faith in the people's intelligence (yes, even the poor<br>
people's intelligence) to understand why it's better, and therefore to not<br>
try to revolt if such reforms take place.  If welfare does turn out to be<br>
good for the people after all, then we rightly should have to choose<br>
between welfare-capitalism and socialism.  But if it turns out to be BAD<br>
for the poor, why shouldn't we try abandon it, rather than assume that they<br>
will irrationally revolt, no matter how good our policies?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(sorry to be such a pain in the butt ;-) but: we then also have to take</i><br>
<i>&gt;into account how 'cost' is determined. People rioting in LA are causing</i><br>
<i>&gt;cost to individuals and companies that _may_ have been avoided if their</i><br>
<i>&gt;standard of living was better. These cost are now being paid by a limited</i><br>
<i>&gt;selection of people (who happened to own a store in the wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt;neighborhood). Is that fair? You seem to agree with me that stability may</i><br>
<i>&gt;have value (even though we can't put a price-tag on it).</i><br>
<p>
Uhm...  I'm not exactly certain how to respond to this.  Of course the<br>
destruction of other people's property isn't fair.  That's why it's<br>
illegal. :)<br>
<p>
Also, isn't it a little morally questionable for anyone, even the poor, to<br>
say "Give us your money or we'll smash up your store?"  I could maybe buy<br>
this argument if they were literally starving in the streets, but in<br>
America at least, we're in no way even close to this point.  America's poor<br>
are overweight on average.<br>
<p>
Also, I still disagree with you about the rioting.  I don't think that<br>
violence is inevitable, but rather that the poor, being generally honest<br>
and intelligent people, will refrain from violent upheaval if it's in their<br>
best interests in the long run.  I'm still open to the argument that<br>
abandoning welfare may not be better for the poor in the long run... but<br>
that's different from saying that the poor will revolt EVEN IF IT'S AGAINST<br>
THEIR BEST INTERESTS.<br>
<p>
You argue that if we deny the poor welfare payments, they will steal, riot<br>
and kill to get it back, no matter how good it might be for them in the<br>
long run.  It seems to me that no rational person would do such a thing<br>
unless it was absolutely the only way to avoid death.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That would certainly seem to be the nicest option. I also agree with</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dalibor den Otter that making a basic living standard freely available for</i><br>
<i>&gt;everyone could be a nice way to keep things stable as more and more persons</i><br>
<i>&gt;become obsolete through automation. The cost of this should become less and</i><br>
<i>&gt;less untill it becomes insignificant.</i><br>
<p>
Sadly, however, medical care is the big spender that you'll never be able<br>
to sufficiently subsidize until we develop immortality.  You can feed the<br>
poor, you can get clothes on their backs and a roof over their heads, (at<br>
greater cost,) but there's always some new medicine, some new expensive<br>
form of treatment available that might keep you alive, particularly as you<br>
grow older and organs naturally start failing.  How much health is enough?<br>
When can we say that we're done subsidizing life?  How is high quality<br>
medical care to be distributed fairly not to those who have worked to<br>
afford it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes but who's death when? </i><br>
<i>&gt;Two more questions (and I can only hope they're good ;-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not at all sure that funds freed by abolishing welfare systems will end</i><br>
<i>&gt;up being invested in immortality research. Won't it simply go largly into</i><br>
<i>&gt;bigger cars, vacations and onther nice goodies?</i><br>
<p>
The funds freed by abolishing welfare systems would go into everything<br>
people buy.  That's the nature of economic growth... it provides more<br>
wealth for everything we do and want, including vacations, including<br>
medicine, including science, including the environment.  Also, don't forget<br>
that hard working people get paid because you buy those cars, take those<br>
vacations, and enjoy your goodies, who pay other hard working people for<br>
their own goodies.  More wealth means more wealth for everything.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And there is the fact that advancing research is not purely an financial</i><br>
<i>&gt;question. 'Law of diminishing returns' is the correct engglish term I</i><br>
<i>&gt;think. Pumping twice as much funding into a program won't speed it up a</i><br>
<i>&gt;factor two (it might but there's no guarantee). Based on what I hear from</i><br>
<i>&gt;neurological research this seems to be especially true for medical sciences</i><br>
<i>&gt;(as opposed to stuff like space exploration).</i><br>
<p>
Maybe.  But economics has another handy rule just for this purpose: the<br>
utility maximization rule.  This rule states that househoulds should<br>
buy/invest in whatever they want most, up until the point where the cost of<br>
buying more would outweigh the happiness it would bring you.<br>
<p>
Economists conceptualize this with two curves on a graph of money invested<br>
against output.  The first curve is the marginal utility curve, or the<br>
extra utility you get from each extra dollar you spend.  The other curve is<br>
the marginal cost curve, or the utility you could get by spending your<br>
dollar on something else.  This curve is usually accelerating, as it<br>
becomes harder and harder to get more and more dollars.  You have to do<br>
more work, and you have to sacrifice more goods that are worth more and<br>
more to you.<br>
<p>
Anyway, the argument goes that you should buy more of good X up until the<br>
point where you don't gain anymore happiness by buying more.<br>

Why am I mentioning this?  Because when your income increases relative to<br>
the price of other goods, your marginal cost curve shifts to the right.<br>
That's precisely what it means to get more income for the same work: it's<br>
easier to get a dollar.  As a result, not only does it become easier to buy<br>
science, food, and vacations, but you also get more of whatever you want<br>
most, which presumably makes you happier.<br>
<p>
Now, of course, these curves don't actually exist in this form.  But<br>
economists explain that away by saying that even if people don't do THIS,<br>
the model's predictive ability is rather good, so people are doing<br>
something a lot LIKE this whenever they go to a store to buy something;<br>
just like how the brain does something like differential equations whenever<br>
it catches a ball, or something like probabilistic number theory when it<br>
evaluates risks.<br>
<p>
Household behavor, and the utility maximization rules, are primarily<br>
micro-economics rather than macro.  Try looking there if you want more info.<br>
