<i>&gt;        I think that the ban can be directly linked to the large amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt;media attention that has been brought to the breakthroughs in cloning.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Imagine, for instance, if Richard Seed and the ones who effectively cloned</i><br>

<i>&gt;Seed's (and his predecessors') desire for media coverage that the potential</i><br>
<i>&gt;uses of cloning have been deemed "illegal" by the aforementioned countries.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hopefully the creators of effective nanotechnology and other progressive</i><br>
<i>&gt;breakthroughs will have a little bit more discretion when announcing their</i><br>
<i>&gt;creations.</i><br>

I conclude, basically the following about this:<br>
<p>
<p>
1. The propagation would never be the problem if people were more<br>
intelligent and instructed... In other words , "plebes" still has to be<br>
trated with "bread, circus" and... no serious information, so they do not<br>
give their idiot opinion!! ( and, worse,  votes in a democracy...or better:<br>
"demagoguerycracy") Even Jesus said: "Do not give your pearls to pigs !!<br>
They will pass over them and hurt you after that..." (obs: I'm not<br>
religious anyway... just an aprovement of a philosophical local idea...)<br>
<p>
2. I include the midia in such lack of intelligence since they do not<br>
divulge the good aspects of clonning... just <br>
the neurotical possible uses of some crazy fegs, which (the uses) sell more<br>
newspapers or tv audience level points to the laic people (majority).<br>
<p>
<p>
Although we try to do what is possible &gt;&gt;&gt; mankind is not yet prepaired to<br>
such evolution &gt;&gt;&gt; they first have to clean out the spider-weds and<br>
*clonned phantoms*  from their minds...<br>
