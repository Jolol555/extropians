David Gelernter (Yale University computer science professor) has a new book<br>
out and with it comes science and art.  The book is titled _Machine Beauty_<br>
and brings to light Gelernter's views about science, art and the machine.   <br>
<p>
"If the author [Gelernter] had his way, all computer scientists and software<br>
engineers would be rushed off to crash courses in drawing, design, and art<br>
history ...." (Jackson, "BusinessWeek" magazine, 3/2/98 issue.)<br>
<p>
You can read "Wired" article about David Gelernter<br>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/5.02/lifestreams/index.html;">http://www.wired.com/wired/5.02/lifestreams/index.html;</a><br>
<p>

<p>
"David Gelernter's research interests include parallel programming, software<br>
ensembles, and artificial intelligence. The coordination language called<br>
"Linda" that he developed with Nicholas Carriero (also of Yale) sees fairly<br>
widespread use world-wide for parallel programming. Linda and its central<br>
idea, called "tuple spaces", is the basis for the "JavaSpaces: extension to<br>
Java recently outlined by JavaSoft; the goal of JavaSpaces is to "unify and<br>
simplify," according to JavaSoft 's presentation at JavaOne -- Specifically<br>
to unify object storage and inter-program communication, as in Linda.<br>
Gelernter's current research interests include adaptive parallelism (the<br>
"Piranha" system runs parallel programs by grabbing idle workstation cycles,<br>
releasing machines when their owners need them), programming environments<br>
for parallelism, realtime data fusion, and expert databases. He is co-author<br>
of two textbooks (on programming languages and on parallel programming<br>
methods), author of Mirror Worlds (Oxford: 1991) and a forthcoming book<br>
about how thinking works (Free Press)."<br>
