One reason for believing in the existence of God is the fact that the<br>
universe appears to be narrowly tailored for the existence of our kind<br>
of life.  Take a look at figure 5 on <a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/toe.html">http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/toe.html</a><br>
and you see what a tiny fraction of the possible values for physical<br>
constants would allow life as we know it to exist.  One way to explain<br>
this seeming coincidence is to say that our universe was intentionally<br>
created to have parameters in this region.<br>
<p>
Note that this does not explain where the universe creator came from.<br>
It is possible that the universe in which he lives is fundamentally<br>
different from our own in ways we can't currently imagine, and is such<br>
that life can exist automatically.  He then created our universe to<br>
explore the possibility of how our kind of life would work, which is<br>
only possible within this narrow and special range (an advanced version<br>
of the way we play with different rules for cellular automata, and find<br>
that only a limited set of rules lead to interesting behavior).<br>
<p>
Of course there are alternate explanations for this coincidence.  It<br>
may be that all possible universes exist, and only those for which the<br>
constants are such as to allow the formation of life do have life form.<br>
But that is not a much simpler theory than the one which says that<br>
we were formed out of another universe; both require the existence of<br>
universes that we otherwise have no evidence for.<br>
