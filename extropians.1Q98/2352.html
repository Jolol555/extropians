<i> &gt;Developing our own selves is our own business. Developing other selves is</i><br>

<p>
What enemy? I'm sorry, but this sounds like you're picketing in front of a<br>
clinic or something (or maybe it's just my reli-fanatic-alarm going off?).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The process of developing another self begins with</i><br>
<i> &gt;conception,</i><br>
<p>
Since the fetus at this stage is nearly indistinguisable from most other<br>
mammals and many other vertebrates that would mean that a pig fetus has the<br>
same value &amp; rights as a human, after birth the fetus somehow loses that<br>
value/those right and it's ok to use it as a source of protein. Unless, of<br>
course, you believe that a human fetus has something called a 'soul' from<br>
the moment of conception.<br>
<p>
The parallel-server that I'm working on has no intelligence and thus no<br>
value&amp;rights as a consious being. But this could chance in 25 years. Maybe<br>
all it takes is a processor-upgrade and smarter software? That would mean<br>
that this 'lump of metal' is a potential consious being. O dear. What right<br>
do I have feeding it all these problems that I want to have solved. Maybe<br>
it would rather be playing chess (it's good at that). If everything that<br>
has the potential of becoming a human has the rights of a human then we're<br>
comitting mass-murder every time we have sex. Something tells me thit is<br>
not a workable model.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;it doesn't matter if it's natural conception or artificial.</i><br>
<i> &gt;When conception occurs is a matter of the completion of the normal full set</i><br>
<i> &gt;of chromosomes within the fertilized egg.</i><br>
<p>
What's so special about that? lot's of cells contain a complete set (and a<br>
good thing they do! ;-)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I am not arguing for a moral</i><br>
<i> &gt;absolute in the treatment of fertilized eggs, I am simply saying that any</i><br>
<i> &gt;treatment becomes a political question, not an individual question and not</i><br>
<i> &gt;a judicial or executive question.</i><br>
<p>
Ah yes, but the political conclusion that was reached in most modern<br>
countries was: "This is a choice the woman in question must decide for<br>
herself, after having been duly advised of the pro's and con's." or<br>
something like that. If you have an alternative, practical, model for<br>
deciding these things I'd love to hear it.<br>
<p>
Fact is that after an abortion the remains of the fetus are usualy<br>
destroyed, a great waste since some of the tissue's have great medical<br>
potential. If destroying it is acceptable, why would medical use (with<br>
permission of course) not be?<br>
