BTW, James Halperin offers a reward to people who find factual errors in<br>
TFI which he later corrects.  I emailed him a couple of minor points,<br>
and he promptly sent me an autographed copy of The Truth Machine!<br>
This was very generous of him, and I was pleased because I'm looking<br>
forward to reading his first novel after enjoying the second one so much.<br>
<p>
If you're worried about ordering from Amazon, I can say that I got TFI<br>
that way, and it arrived in just three days even though I specified<br>
standard shipping (which I think was $4).  It's an inexpensive way to<br>
get books, and the current discount makes it a "steal".<br>
