<p>
What I find so troubling is that an office so far away from the power centers, that<br>
is supposedly under the aegis of the Inspector General (which, constitutionally, is<br>
the watcher of the watchers), could hide such an implication, as well as cover up<br>
the coverup, and conduct a vandetta against people in their organization who still<br>
beleive in public oversight. That Ron Brown may have been murdered is not in my<br>
opinion, the important thing. I do, however, think that there is an important<br>
national security possibility here: That the administration could be covering this<br>
up, becuase he might have been killed by the serbs, in order to prevent public<br>
sentiment to come down in favor of a more vietnam-like involvement in Bosnia. If<br>
this is the case, what they are doing could be laudable, but even then, I would say<br>
that they still have handled things badly, as they have not gotten all involved<br>
parties vetted and sworn to secrecy over this matter. Yeah, Im damning them if they<br>
did and if they didn't, so what, its the incompetence that counts.<br>
