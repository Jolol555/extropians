<i>&gt; Well, I found a picture in a book about the brain, It was a scan.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You could see very clearly how the blood had build up between the</i><br>
<i>&gt; skull and the brain. I agree that this could be a bit missleading</i><br>

<i>&gt; brain. </i><br>

There are actually several kinds of stroke.  This is a serious <br>
problem for medical professionals because different kinds of stroke <br>
have different treatments.  The single most common kind of stroke, <br>
the preferred treatment is anticoagulants -- there are at least two <br>
other kinds of stroke where anticoagulants are *exactly* the *wrong* <br>
thing to do.<br>
<p>
The most common sort of stroke is when a blood clot forms within a <br>
blood vessel in the brain (or moves to a narrow, perhaps <br>
already-constricted, location in the brain), cutting off blood to a <br>
portion of the brain.  Anticoagulants to help break up the clot are <br>
in order.<br>
<p>
Another, somewhat less common sort of stroke is when a blood vessel <br>
breaks, causing blood to pool outside the circulatory system and put <br>
pressure on part of the brain.<br>
<p>
A rather less common sort of stroke is when a blood vessel breaks, <br>
and the leakage is not enough to cause the sort of stroke mentioned <br>
in the previous paragraph -- but the blood is flowing through the <br>
break, *not* down the blood vessel, so a nearby part of the brain is <br>
deprived of blood.<br>
<p>
And there are other sorts...<br>
