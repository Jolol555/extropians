<i>&gt; Someone mentioned Richard Seed being on the radio for his desire to set up</i><br>

<p>
Considering how heavily most religious people weigh in against the idea,<br>
he was probably just dropping some meme grenades to help nullify the<br>
righteousness of the opposition.<br>
<p>
Considering that he was the guy who developed the procedure for woman to<br>
woman embryo transfers, and several other fertility breakthroughs (which<br>
were in their time, considered unethical and radical), I think that<br>
while he may be a bit daring to take on the establishment, he's exactly<br>
what we need right now to oppose the reactionary luddites.<br>
