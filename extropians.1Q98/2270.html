No, don't tell me, it might ruin the suprise.<br>

<p>
IM-less-than-HO, art is probably best looked at as the exploration of<br>
communication (more message than medium.)  Transhuman and Extropian<br>
artists are exploring ways to communicate their ideas.  If, as someone<br>
commented, Nike means "I am utterly stupid and boring" then the<br>
artists (and wearers) have found away of communicating that to you. <br>
Of course, I could be wrong, I've had bad experiences defining art in<br>
the past.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; By the way, the transhuman.org site is co-sponsored by FM-2030.</i><br>
<i>&gt; [...] He did author the first book about transhumans, explicitly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which I consider to be the foremost book about transhuman values.</i><br>
<p>
Is it a bad thing that I have no clue who FM-2030 is?  Should I try<br>
re-tuning my radio?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Art and the Singularity?  I think Vernor Vinge would strongly</i><br>
disagree with <br>
<i>&gt; your assumed notion that the Singularity is not affiliated with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; creative.  He is an artist, you know.</i><br>
<p>
I never understand the whole Creativity vs. Science thing, surely the<br>
act of science is creative and is an art form.  Taking a look at a<br>
dictionary, art is described as "imitative or imaginative... in which<br>
skill can be expressed."  It doesn't exclude science until, "certain<br>
branches of learning as distinct from sciences" which kinda rains on<br>
my parade.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Oh, and by the way, Eric Drexler himself is quite stylish and </i><br>
<i>&gt; frequently displays the art of humor.</i><br>
<p>
No no, humour is a science, it takes years of study, testing and<br>
research to implement even the smallest joke.  Have you ever seen the<br>
victims of sarcasm gone wrong?<br>
<p>
So here's the BIG question:<br>
<p>
1) What is the difference between science and art anyway?<br>
<p>
