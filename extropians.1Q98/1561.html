<i>&gt; What needs to be added?</i><br>
<p>
	Phenomenal qualia that can be put together into powerfully<br>
unified spatial conscious representations of knowledge.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; would continuous analog elements of some sort suffice, or do you</i><br>
<i>&gt; need quantum effects?</i><br>
<p>
	We don't yet know what the sensations we use to represent our<br>
conscious knowledge are.  We just know what they are introspectively<br>
like.  We don't yet know how these sensations are able to be put or<br>
unified together to build or conscious awareness.  We just know that<br>
we can be aware of much of it all simultaneously in a unified<br>
conscious world of phenomenal awareness.  We don't know whether these<br>
qualia are based on something analog or quantum or something else<br>
entirely.  But one thing is very obvious, red (which we use to<br>
represent 700 nm light, and by the way is nothing like 700 nm light<br>
since it is in our brain) is certainly a lot more (and much more rich<br>
in meaning resulting in our greater intelligence) than some mere non<br>
unified abstract set of bits where it doesn't matter if these bits are<br>
represent by a man in a room reading kanji, holes in paper, or quantim<br>
bits in a quantum computer.<br>
