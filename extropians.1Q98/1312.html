Actually, this is from Nick's wife, Myra. Although I wasn't asked, I'll<br>
venture my opinion.<br>
<p>
I grew up near DC, and the only food I ate for my first 18 years was fruits<br>
and vegetables grown in the garden in my parents back yard. Occasionally we<br>
had animal flesh from a grocery store, but no vegetables nor breads were<br>
store bought. Almost all veggies consumed were either raw or steamed. A<br>
favorite was fresh soybeans, which is impossible to purchase almost<br>
anywhere and is incredibly delicious.<br>
<p>
You can probably imagine what happened when I left home for college and my<br>
diet became full of preservatives (institutional food, fast food,<br>
restaurant food). Yes, for almost two years I was unable to keep most food<br>
in my system and became a target for every flu and cold imaginable. A<br>
lesson I've never forgotten.<br>
<p>
The point being, we are poisioning ourselves with all the crap added to our<br>
food, be it vegetable or meat and we deserve all the unhealthiness we have<br>
because we've let it happen and have not demanded otherwise. As for beef<br>
(who, for the most part graze on government lands, anyway) I don't see any<br>
major business taking the time or money to replace that ca$h crop with<br>
something else.<br>
<p>
Myra<br>
<p>
PS If we all put in gardens and ate what we grew, we'd be a lot healthier,<br>
too. The only way to effect change in America's (by far the worst) eating<br>
habits is to let the unhealthy ones die as an example to society. Will that<br>
ever happen? Not likely.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;  IAN: Well, hemp will grow in the worst soils, </i><br>

<i>&gt;  Hemp seed is second only to the soy bean in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  protein, and unlike the soy bean is not known</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to be an allergen. Hemp seed oil is also high</i><br>
<i>&gt;  in the varieties of fat that increase the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  good cholesterol and decrease the bad, LDL.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  As I understand, it takes 9 pounds of gain </i><br>
<i>&gt;  consumed by a cow to yield one pound of meat.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Of course the meat may have a higher concen-</i><br>
<i>&gt;  tration of protein than most grains, yet soy</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and hemp are sufficiently protein rich to </i><br>
<i>&gt;  meet and exceed human protein needs. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I did a report back in high school calculating</i><br>
<i>&gt;  how much more food we would have if the food </i><br>
<i>&gt;  that livestock ate was not devoted to feeding</i><br>
<i>&gt;  animals born to be killed for human consumption.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I'd have to dig up that report to get the exact </i><br>
<i>&gt;  numbers, but I recall that the amount of food </i><br>
<i>&gt;  in the world would increase about 4X or more.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  If I recall, almost 70% of grains grown go to </i><br>
<i>&gt;  the feeding of livestock to support the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  system of meat-eating mass murder.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I've been a vegetarian for 19 years without </i><br>
<i>&gt;  any health related problems, and probably </i><br>
<i>&gt;  many health related benefits, although it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  impossible to determine the bad health you've</i><br>
<i>&gt;  avoided since you cannot be both the subject </i><br>
<i>&gt;  and the control of your own experiment. But</i><br>
<i>&gt;  studies suggest that a vegetarian diet is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  far healthier than nonvegatarian diets.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  And anything that is more healty and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  more ethical is more extropian.</i><br>
