Good point, Charlie, but isn't it largely a matter of size rather than<br>
of design?  Suppose you had an earth-mass of O'Neill cylinders.  (How<br>
many would that be?  A whole lot, you betcha.)  Now throwing a rock or<br>
two isn't going to cause much damage either.<br>
<p>
Conceivably the system could even withstand collapse of civilization,<br>
if it is self-repairing.  The idea of a culture living unknowingly within<br>
a starship is as old as SF.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course, why the hell are we talking about habitats to support an</i><br>
<i>&gt; agriculture-based society when there's the open question of what kind</i><br>
<i>&gt; of habitat is appropriate to an uploaded mind to discuss?)</i><br>
<p>
In Greg Egan's Diaspora (now available in the U.S., BTW) a whole<br>
civilization lives uploaded in a featureless blob a foot or so in size.<br>
(Actually it was never clear to me how large the population was; at some<br>
point I had the impression that everyone knew everyone else at least<br>
dimly, and even accounting for large lifespans it would suggest that<br>
there were no more than a few million inhabitants).<br>
