What kind of light?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report I heard on NPR
didn't say the "signal" was a
<BR>mystery.&nbsp; It's via the blood.&nbsp; Evidently the "himo" in the
hemoglobin
<BR>is molecularly very similar to light sensative stuff that makes plants
<BR>green.&nbsp; The "back of the knee" is good because there are lots
of blood
<BR>vessels close to the surface of the skin and light can be easily
<BR>applied there such that the eyes aren't aware of it.&nbsp; Light shined
in
<BR>the eyes also makes lots of contact with blood so this is why this
<BR>sets this clock so well.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting.
