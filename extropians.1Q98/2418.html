<i>         &gt;&gt;Why not use radiation pressure?</i><br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;rrandall6@juno.com </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Because they had no good way to make high-energy X-rays turn a right </i><br>
<i>        &gt;angle?  The geometry of the device seems to forbid anything except </i><br>
<i>        &gt;good X-ray mirrors, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's true that true that there are no good X ray mirrors, except for some <br>
very recent ones and they must be designed to work only in a very narrow <br>
bandwidth, and that wouldn't be of much use for blackbody radiation in a bomb. <br>
As I said in my other post only, 1 or 2 percent of the X rays would be <br>
reflected, and you'd only get that if the angel of reflection was less than <br>
180 degrees like what an optical mirror can achieve, and even less that your  <br>
right angle, but that would still be useful, however there is a more important  <br>
point, if you don't have a good mirror the next best thing is a good radiator. <br>
If the X rays  are not reflected by the Black Body chamber then they will be <br>
absorbed, that  will heat up the chamber to a very high temperature and then <br>
re-radiate.<br>
   <br>
I doubt the following has anything to do with H bombs, but X ray optics has <br>
always fascinated me for some reason. As I said X ray mirrors have been made, <br>
Dr. Nat  Ceglio at Livermore  made an X ray mirror using many thin layers of <br>
Molybdenum and Silicon. Each layer doesn't reflect much but if the thickness <br>
of the layers are chosen properly at one narrow wavelength all the reflected <br>
waves coincide. The reflection is about 60 % efficient. Useless in a bomb but <br>
great in a LASER<br>
<p>
X ray lens seemed impossible but very recently there was a breakthrough there <br>
also. The trouble was that when you go beyond the near ultraviolet there <br>
didn't seem to be any material you could make a lens out of. Aluminum is <br>
almost as  transparent to hard  (over 14 kev) X rays as glass is to light, <br>
but the index of refraction is so  tiny that the focal length of a simple <br>
lens would be huge, far too long to be practical. Heavier elements like Gold <br>
have a higher index of refraction, but  they strongly absorb X rays, your <br>
lens would be almost completely opaque.<br>
<p>
In the November 7 1996 issue of Nature is an article called "A Compound   <br>
Refractive Lens For Focusing High Energy X Rays" by Snigirev, Kohn, Snigireva  <br>
and Lengeler. They found a easy and cheap way to focus very Hard X  Rays,  up <br>
to about 40 kev. Their lens is simply an Aluminum block with holes of radius <br>
.3 millimeter drilled into it, it looks like this:                 <br>
             <br>

                  <br>
                         <br>
Each hole drilled into the Aluminum block is a lens, one lens may give you a  <br>
ridiculously long focal length, but 2 will cut that distance in half, this <br>
first device has 30 lenses.  The focal length of their compound lens is <br>
R/ 2NI, R is the radius of the holes, N is the number of holes, and I is the <br>
index of refraction in the X ray region of the material. In this lens the <br>
holes are cylinders so the X rays are focused in only 2 dimensions, for 3  <br>
you'd need spheres, or another block oriented at right angles. The authors <br>
don't seem to think it would be very difficult to make a device with hundreds, <br>
perhaps thousands of such lenses. The authors also calculate that if they <br>
could make the holes in a parabolic shape they could reduce the focal length <br>
by a further factor of 5.  Although they haven't tried it yet they also think <br>
the same lens could also focus something else that was thought to be <br>
impossible, a beam of neutrons.<br>
<p>
Aluminum was used in this case because it's easy to machine, but boron,  <br>
carbon, plastic and even water should work too. It occurs to me that it might  <br>
not be too difficult to make an array of small spherical bubbles in water,  <br>
they wouldn't stay in place for long but they wouldn't need to, the X rays  <br>
from a laser would be in a VERY short burst.             <br>
<p>
This could be very important for X rays in photolithography to make very tiny <br>
semiconductor devices. If you don't have any optical elements then  you can't <br>
optically reduce the size of your image, your mask must be as small as the <br>
very  microprocessor you're trying to make, and you must place it right on <br>
top of the silicon, as in a contact sheet in photography. None of this seemed <br>
very practicable to most people so Xray photolithography has been stuck in a <br>
rut. Maybe now things will change.<br>
