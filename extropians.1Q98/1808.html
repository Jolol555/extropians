My novel HOST for which I had much deeply appreciated help from several<br>
people and organisations involved in the fields of cryonics and life<br>
extension, has been made into a 3-hour television movie, premiering on ABC<br>
network across the USA on Thursday, February 26th, under the title of<br>
VIRTUAL OBSESSION.  ABC are giving it their entire prime time viewing for<br>
that evening.<br>
<p>
Scripted by Preston Sturges Jnr and Mick Garris, directed by Mick Garris<br>
(The Shining and The Stand) it stars Peter Gallagher, Mimi Rogers,<br>
Bridgette Wilson (I Know What You Did Last Summer)  Robert Vaughan (The Man<br>
<i>&gt;From UNCLE) and Jake Lloyd, a terrific child actor who has a major role in</i><br>
the forthcoming Star Wars film.<br>
<p>
The novel is about a scientist's search for immortality thru cryonics and<br>
thru artificial intelligence.  I'm over the moon with the film adaption -<br>
it has been stunningly made and is deeply faithful to the theme I wanted to<br>
address in the novel, that living forever is going to become a reality.<br>
<p>
I hope everyone who watches enjoys it, and I would welcome comments.<br>
<p>
