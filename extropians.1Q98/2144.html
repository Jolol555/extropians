I hold no brief for Dr Mills, and certainly not for `cold fusion'<br>
claimants.  As I mentioned when I posted these urls, I think it's likely<br>
that he's either a crackpot or a scamster.  But I find Hal's line of<br>
argument interesting, given the views common on this list.<br>
<p>
Mills claims to have a `secret' catalyst, and hopes to make money out of<br>
it, eh?  Suppose he *had* cracked the fabled Shipstone secret (a Heinlein<br>
reference for readers of RAH) - what should he have done?  Given it to the<br>
world for free?  Patented it?  (He says he did, in Australia, although I<br>
haven't checked that out.)  Then one might use a less prejudiced and<br>
melodramatic term than `secret' - `proprietory', perhaps?  But people here<br>
such as Lee Daniel Crocker regularly inveigh against this path, asserting<br>
the merits of an agoric economy.   <br>
<p>
He claims `a virtually inexaustible source of energy', does he?  Well, in a<br>
way - but he doesn't say it's free, or can be harvested using two wires and<br>
a piece of rubber.  And proponents of solar, tidal and hot fusion energy<br>
also promote their favorites by pointing to their inexaustible supply.  So<br>
this, too, fails to make Mills a crackpot.<br>
<p>
He probably *is* one.  It's pretty unlikely that `classical' revisions of<br>
QT will solve the outstanding problems of the inconsistencies between QT<br>
and relativity (but *something* will have to).  But I think we need to be<br>
careful about the kinds of arguments we adduce in deciding not to look<br>
through the new instrument.  (Just more routine rhetoric - no, folks, *I'm<br>
not asserting that Mills is the new Galileo!*)<br>
