Topic<br>
<p>
Why do you think the image of modern technology being 'out of control'<br>
has such a strong appeal? In what ways does technology appear difficult<br>
to control? For some of the problems you identify, explore their<br>
implications for government policy-makers. Provide examples for your<br>
arguments.<br>
<p>
Abstract<br>
<p>
The essay examines several explanations for the prevalence of the view<br>
that technology is 'out of control'. Possible types of control are<br>
considered and analogies drawn with technology itself. Factors which<br>
have determined the public perception of technology and they way in<br>
which it appears 'out of control' are examined through issues such as<br>
the image of machines in the entertainment industry and mass media,<br>
historical views of technology, human emotions and resistance to change,<br>
the increasingly specialised nature of technology, the perception of<br>
individual technologies as 'out of control', and ethical considerations.<br>
Difficulties for policy makers in a capitalist democratic society are<br>
investigated in light of the increasingly esoteric nature of technology,<br>
the disparity between ethics and technological development, and the fact<br>
that the end result of technological progress depends on the people<br>
using the technologies as much as the technologies themselves.<br>
<p>
Content<br>
<p>
Humanity has long aspired to mould nature in it's image, to force nature<br>
to conform to human desires, to control nature. The universe was<br>
perceived by early humans to be volitional, and early religion speaks<br>
testimony of this anthropomorphic world view. The development of the<br>
deterministic paradigm upon which the modern artifacts of science and<br>
technology stand is therefore one of many places where a line separating<br>
primitive from modern man may be drawn, as it is this insight into the<br>
universe which began to allow humans to predict, explain, and - most<br>
importantly - affect the workings of nature. Nevertheless, a new dilemma<br>
has arisen - that of the control of technology itself.<br>
<p>
It has been said that whoever controls technology controls the future. A<br>
view which has become prevalent in modern society is that technology is<br>
'out of control' - and therefore that the future is out of human hands.<br>
The reasons for this view are numerous and in the majority erroneous.<br>
The intuitive or common notion of the word control involves a<br>
centralised directing or restraining force; in this sense technology is<br>
'out of control', for there is no single agency or regulatory power<br>
which exercises authority over technological development.  Furthermore,<br>
there is no person or collective which can lay claim to understanding<br>
all existing technology. An alternate form of control, with it's origins<br>
in robotics and computer science, is termed distributed control , or<br>
bottom-up control, where overall order is obtained through the smaller<br>
scale independent management of component parts of a system. A breakdown<br>
in this analogy is that in robotics component parts are designed with a<br>
goal in mind; and there is not necessarily an "equivalent selective<br>
force in society as a whole that will cause the techno-societal system<br>
to tend toward homeostasis" . These models, however, do not take into<br>
account the social framework within which technological development<br>
operates.<br>
<p>
Interestingly, the 'out of control' image is not primarily the result of<br>
an awareness of these broad issues; rather, it results largely from the<br>
interplay of various other determining factors. <br>
The manner in which society presents technology through the arts and the<br>
media has been a significant factor in the perception of technology as<br>
'out of control'. In science fiction especially "the view of technology<br>
as a violent, animal force is widespread and, in popular culture at<br>
least, no longer needs justification". The Terminator movies, which<br>
portray a world in which machines have overtaken humans, are one<br>
example. Adding to this negative image of technology is the mass media,<br>
renowned for  focusing primarily on bad news. This emphasis on negative<br>
connotations results in the public perception that either technologists<br>
are inhuman, or the effects of technology itself are out of control.<br>
<p>
Additionally responsible for the 'out of control' image are residual<br>
historical attitudes to technological development. Anti-technology<br>
sentiments most likely originated with the Industrial Revolution of the<br>
late 18th Century, which saw the machine become viewed as a displacer of<br>
humans and inherently evil. The public perception of the progression of<br>
technology since that time period has passed through and now<br>
incorporates attitudes of infatuation and blind acceptance of results -<br>
"Can we?", ethical considerations due to the possibility of undesirable<br>
results - "Should we?", and the current dilemma of control - "Can we<br>
manage it?" However the inherent issue of control "is not, as some<br>
historians and philosophers would have us imagine, that of man versus<br>
machine. It is the much older conflict of man versus man" Technology<br>
does not simply arise from nothing - rather, it is the result of human<br>
desire to extend our ability to control nature, and to improve the<br>
convenience of life.<br>
<p>
If this is the case, and it is certainly logical that technology is<br>
fashioned in the human interest, why does the 'out of control' image<br>
persist? The answer lies partly in the collective human psyche - for<br>
"how we try and control technology has a great deal to do with how we<br>
feel about it." Technological progress means change, and technophobia is<br>
often a part of a larger state of neophobia, the aversion to all things<br>
new. This is not only due to the fact that change is occurring but,<br>
increasingly, because of the extreme rapidity of technological<br>
development. The multitude of decisions which are forced members of a<br>
technological society result in feelings of bewilderment, resentment and<br>
mistrust of established authority. Additionally - and this may sound<br>
frivolous - people tend to attach inordinate value to superseded<br>
technology. Some would suggest that this romantic posture is more than<br>
trifling in it's influence on the general resistance to technological<br>
change. This reluctance of people to take control of new technology<br>
contributes to the overall 'out of control' image.<br>
<p>
On a slightly different note, new technology by it's very nature is<br>
increasingly esoteric, and the 'out of control' image is partly fuelled<br>
by a general inability to understand it. The nature of technological<br>
progress itself means that "while we have more knowledge, we have less<br>
understanding" - and this is also true of the technologists at the<br>
fringes of technological development. Couple this with the increasing<br>
integration of and reliance on technology in every day life and the<br>
question of whether technology actually controls us  appears to become<br>
more valid. This polar view of technology is not rational when the<br>
origins of technology itself are considered, however - more accurate is<br>
the statement that humans control or limit themselves through<br>
technology. <br>
The 'out of control' image is also partly due to the relaxation of<br>
direct control on individual technologies themselves. Current machine<br>
technology is becoming increasingly biological and directly<br>
anthropomorphic, while technology is also delving into genetic<br>
engineering and other biological realms. It is being realised that to<br>
fully reap the benefits of technology some element of decision making<br>
and independence must be incorporated into machines, which means that<br>
"the creator must share control, and his destiny, with his creations."<br>
This does not mean, however, that humans have resigned control - we<br>
merely control the level of control given to machines, as it were. <br>
<p>
The transfer of previously human functions to machines obviously raises<br>
challenges to traditional beliefs, morals and ethics - indeed, some<br>
would say that it promotes unwanted values: "Technology has caused<br>
softening, dependency, degradation, disengagement and escapism -- all of<br>
which impart a loss of meaning." And this is not the only area in which<br>
technology infringes on untrodden ethical walkways, as the current human<br>
cloning debate highlights. Of course, the 'out of control' image is<br>
further added to by such ethical dilemma, but the issues really are<br>
separate - in the case of cloning the technology is under control but<br>
the ethics are lagging.  As Paul Schmitt notes, "We have to get our<br>
theology and philosophy and legislation all sort of thought through in<br>
light of this extraordinary new set of circumstances." Thus government<br>
policy is given the task of adapting to the new technology of cloning<br>
and ensuring the public interest is upheld.<br>
<p>
It can be seen that the perception of modern technology as 'out of<br>
control' has resulted from a large number of influences. In modern<br>
democratic society it is the responsibility of government  to manage<br>
both the public perception and the public interest. Under a capitalist<br>
society individuals and companies try to manipulate technology for their<br>
own personal advantage - innovation forced by competition. Every<br>
technology can deliver unexpected risks, however, and so the government<br>
must responsibly manage the risks of technological development. For even<br>
in a capitalist society, "The grand issues of our time are settled by<br>
public policy decisions more than by market forces". The difficulty for<br>
policy makers is that it is hard to establish ensure beforehand<br>
responsibility and accountability as the overall success  of policy<br>
(together with blame and liability) can only really be determined long<br>
after the fact.  Moreover, every technological choice raises ethical<br>
questions, and so the end results are determined as much by the morals<br>
and ethics of policy makers as by the technical content. This is<br>
juxtaposed with the 'out of control' image of modern technology, and it<br>
can be seen that steering technology is inherently a political act which<br>
may be sufficient to provide the corrective forces necessary for<br>
effective distributed control.<br>
<p>
The social nature of technology indicates that technological development<br>
is not necessarily unidirectional and blindly deterministic, and that<br>
policy based on prevailing values actually affect the direction which it<br>
takes. The major problem for government then is unpredictability, and<br>
technological complexity - "our social evolution has fallen behind the<br>
technical", and it is a problem which must be faced, as progress is<br>
inevitable on the long term. Modern technology is not 'out of control',<br>
but the end result of technology is determined as much by the nature of<br>
the tool user as by the nature of the tool itself. The implication of<br>
this is that ensuring a positive direction for technology must involve<br>
maintaining a broadly technically literate populace who are at ease with<br>
change, while maintaining close relations with those at the<br>
technological forefront; and if technology appears to be 'out of<br>
control' it is the social structure which is at fault - not technology<br>
itself.<br>
