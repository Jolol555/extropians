First you reject an old fashioned philosophical attempt to derive morality<br>
from nature, they you start pinning loaded terms like 'evil' on the<br>
administrative donkey. (If I didn't know better, why: I might even wonder<br>
if you bore a grudge against government! :)<br>

Explain that to diabetics who can't get reasonably priced medical<br>
insurance cover, then. It's in an insurance company's interest, and the<br>
interests of its other customers, not to take on board individuals who<br>
are at high risk. But life's never that simple, and the obvious<br>
first-order approach ("diabetics are high risk, don't touch 'em") isn't<br>
the whole answer to the question.  For example -- pursuing a speculative<br>
train of thought -- I seem to recall a recent statement by the RAC (here<br>
in the UK) that diabetic hypoglycaemia is a not-too-uncommon cause of<br>
auto accidents. One could prognosticate that it would be of indirect<br>
benefit to the users of a medical insurance company for it to offer<br>
cover for diabetics, because presumably diabetics with adequate medical<br>
supervision are less likely to let their condition get out of hand  <br>
and kill people (including users of our hypothetical insurance<br>
company) while behind the wheel of a car.<br>
<p>
The market is good at looking after local problems. It's complete crap<br>
at predicting the future, though, and it provides no solution to the<br>
tragedy of the commons without the imposition of an external regulator.<br>
<p>
I could hypothesize that the role of government since the age of <br>
enlightenment -- the role that made it useful enough to have persisted<br>
as an institution -- was simply to provide a workable legal and<br>
enforcement environment in which the market could operate. Do away<br>
with governments that think they're there to enforce laws, and you're<br>
left with the next level down: gangsterism. And most people would<br>
prefer their neighbourhood gangsters to use a rule-book, rather than<br>
make up the extortion demands as they go along.<br>
<p>
(This isn't an argument for coercive authority in any absolute sense;<br>
but it's an attempt to explain why _more_ coercive authority can<br>
sometimes be less painful for the people who live under it than<br>
a less powerful but more capricious extortionist.)<br>
