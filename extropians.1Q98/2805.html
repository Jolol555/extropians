<i>&gt; Is lobjan spoken by the 80 million people on the web today?</i><br>
<p>
Are we referring to the internet or to the web?<br>
<p>
This mailing list isn't on the web. Personal email isn't on the web. Newsgroups aren't on the web. Just<br>
because hypertext is a nifty replacement for a library doesn't mean it will also do to replace the post<br>
office and the telephone system<br>
<p>
This entire argument is stupid. You have already been told that people have filters to strip out HTML<br>
mail before they see it. Other people have said they will hit delete and not read HTML mail.<br>
<p>
Do you have so little regard for your own ideas that you will prevent people from seeing your email<br>
simply to make a point? You have yet to explain how you can express yourself more convincingly in HTML<br>
mail, all you have done is rant about being "progressive", but who really cares about how progressive<br>
YOU think you are? What matters is how progressive WE think you are, and if we can't read your writing,<br>
we're not going to have an opinion of you at all, let alone one way or another.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since most of those people use a mail</i><br>
<i>&gt; reader which is HTML capable, it is silly to hold out for the few iconoclasts.</i><br>
<p>
Fine. Send HTML mail. ignore your readers. They'll do a much better job of ignoring you. Which is<br>
shame. But at least you can sit there and feel smug about yourself while the rest of us do something<br>
useful, namely communicate effectively.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Tell me, a skilled user of a slide rule can frequently calculate faster than a person using a hand</i><br>
<i>&gt; calculator. If this is true, then why are slide rules now museum peices? WHat do you think the Air</i><br>
<i>&gt; Force would have said to a contractor that insisted on doing all its engineering work with slide</i><br>
<i>&gt; rules? When I visit Seattle and go down to the International district, I can often see elderly asian</i><br>
<i>&gt; merchants still using abacuses, and whipping along pretty fiercely. However, I don't see them</i><br>
<i>&gt; getting much business from anyone but first generation immigrants, who still revere the aged.</i><br>
<p>
What does this mean? we are talking about -communicating-<br>
<p>
You haven't given an example of how HTML is a better way to communicate than plain ascii as far as<br>
dialogue goes. You have been told that people aren't seeing HTML mail. Doesn't this tell you something?<br>
Do you care?  And I thought *I* was conceited. Sheesh.<br>
I personally could care less who reads your mail. I use netscape to read mail at the moment, although<br>
I'll move back to elm when I get my linux box up and running.  It just disturbs me that someone who<br>
*subscribed* to a mailing list, i.e. actually exerted some effort to join a discussion group, is not<br>
only not concerned when he is told that people don't read mail in his chosen format, but then continues<br>
to argue the point.  Why are you here? Isn't it to engage fellow travellers? Or do you just enjoy the<br>
thrill of watching your modem's "send" light blinking on and off. Empty vessels etc.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Luckily I don't. I don't follow any logic when it comes to discussion fora such as this one, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it strikes me as silly to allow some pointless ideal to get between me and those I wish to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; discuss things with. I'm here to learn things, to discuss things, to be part of a conversation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and it seems to me that rather than looking into "progress"-ive standards, we should support</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; standard standards: something *everyone* can understand, not the 3l33t few. At this point in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; time, it seems that  english expressed in ascii work pretty well. Maybe that will change</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; eventually, but for now it strikes me as ludicrous to say to someone "I'm not interested in what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you have to say because your text isn't 'cool' enough".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sure it works pretty well. Englascii is a fine standard for may discussion type exchanges. However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in order to deliver more complex content, we will eventually have to move to a type of markup</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard, to allow better organisation and presentation of information.</i><br>
<p>
True. I notice you said "standard". At this point in time, as far as mailing lists goes, the standard is<br>
ascii to allow the widest possible distribution of text. Eventually this will change, and I will<br>
appreciate it, but for the moment ascii is what is most commonly used. I can send and receive HTML mail.<br>
I -prefer- to receive HTML mail. But I *very much prefer* to discuss things with the widest possible<br>
selection of people.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As the average individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; starts getting a hundred or more email messages a day, I can easily forsee the need for use of</i><br>
<i>&gt; graphs and tables.</i><br>
<p>
I get well over 200 emails a day. I easily read all of them. Very very very few of them are in HTML<br>
format., and most of those are just web pages which have been forwarded to me.  I really don't see how<br>
HTML will help in volume reduction.  Filters will help in volume reduction. HTML won't, in fact it will<br>
make it a lot worse, as there will be more data to transmit.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can read a graph with one glance, while it takes 10-30 seconds to digest even a</i><br>
<i>&gt; well laid out table. An ascii table with more than a couple rows and columns is a major effort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; deciphering, unless you happen to have the exact same font set on your reader.</i><br>
<p>
This is true. How many tables of either type go through this last per month? How many messages which are<br>
simply plain text go through this list per month?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I fail to see how using ascii is holding you back.  I understood perfectly well your point. How</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would HTML have made it clearer?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; This was just a small fraction of data on near earth asteroid encounters predicted over the next 30</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
And how many such messages do you write to the extropians list?<br>
<p>
Do you see my point?<br>
<p>
I really don't think that the ability to very very rarely present tables accurately is worth tossing<br>
several (at least!) subscribers to this list into the wastebasket.  Feel free to convince me otherwise.<br>
<p>
I already agree that HTML is a better way to transmit complex tables and graphs etc.  But it is not a<br>
better way to communicate the vast majority of the messages to this list, and communication is the<br>
entire point, is it not?<br>
