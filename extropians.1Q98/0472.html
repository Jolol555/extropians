Etacado informs:<br>

"Any attempt to formulate a "God" concept presents the thinker with the<br>
problem of an<br>
infinite regress. You have no right to the words "rational" or "logical"<br>
if you try to evade this issue."<br>
<p>
Well, I certainly wouldn't want to lose my right to use those words, so I<br>
will see what I can do to address the issue.<br>
<p>
Basically, the issue is how to form the theory for the beginning of the<br>
Universe without having the problem of an infinite regress.  Someone<br>
might say an intelligent being created our universe.  Well, how did<br>
*that* universe start?  Another intelligent being created it.  And so on.<br>
 Infinite regress.  Another theory is the Big Bang theory.  Some say that<br>
nothing existed and then suddenly the Big Bang was in progress.  That<br>
seems to evade the infinite regress problem.  But if nothing existed,<br>
then how did the Big Bang occur unless there existed a way for it to<br>
occur? Can something truly come from nothing?  Of course, nothing isn't<br>
anything, so it doesn't exist.  So there is no reason to even consider<br>
it.  The only thing worth considering is the something that does exist,<br>
because that is all there is to consider.  So asking how this Universe<br>
began is really asking how it came from nothing.  But "nothing" doesn't<br>
exist; it is pure fantasy.  So, does that mean the Universe has no real<br>
beginning, since it's impossible for it to not exist, since the state of<br>
nothingness doesn't exist?  If the Universe has no real beginning, then<br>
how do we explain its existence?<br>
<p>
The real question is:  Why is there something, instead of nothing?<br>
<p>
I don't think that question has been answered satisfactorily yet.  My<br>
answer is that "nothing" doesn't exist, so "something" is the only other<br>
option.  But that is just playing with words and doesn't really answer<br>
the question.  Why does anything exist?  <br>
<p>
Well, I'm still evading the infinite regress issue, but hopefully I've<br>
distracted you long enough to reclaim my rights to use the words<br>
"rational" and "logical".<br>
