You may be surprised to learn that human and animal neurons represent<br>
digital data.  Neurons are binary:  They trigger, or they don't.  The<br>
brain cannot detect a level of neuron triggering.  (It is true that<br>
chemical seepage between synapses occurs in an anolog way, but the<br>
neuron remains totally unaffected up to its trigger point, and then it<br>
remains totally "fired" when the amount of neurotransmitter goes above<br>
its trigger point.  Thus, it is like a telegraph wire.  The telegraph<br>
key looks analog, but the data it sends is binary, either on or off.)<br>
<p>
Continuums of sensory input are simulated by: the number of neurons<br>
triggering, how long they trigger, how often they trigger, etc. <br>
Clusters of neurons that trigger at different levels can provide a<br>
degree of measurement in a sensory system, but there is no analog<br>
information being transmitted to the brain.<br>
<p>
Likewise, your output mechanisms are also binary.  Muscle strands are<br>
binary:  They either contract or relax.  There is no way to trigger a<br>
single muscle strand to contract to a specific degree.  Clusters of<br>
muscle strands work together to provide various levels of muscle<br>
contraction within a mass of muscle tissue, but there is no analog<br>
information being transmitted from the brain.<br>
<p>
The communications neural network into and out of the brain is totally<br>
binary.  It is sending binary data packets via the nervous system<br>
network to its destination receptors.<br>
