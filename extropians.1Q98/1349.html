This causes my bullshit alarm to ring loudly.<br>
1)The bandwidth of "all e-mail, telephone and fax communications" in Europe<br>
would be quite high--higher than any feasible satellite channel.<br>
2) Where are the signals intercepted by NSA? nearly all are land-line<br>
only, with no radio component, so physical taps would be necessary. This would<br>
certainly require colusion of the European PTTs, which are mostly run by<br>
European governments. Why would they permit NSA to do this?<br>
3) With serious compression, a phone call can be squeezed to an average of<br>
perhaps 500bytes/sec. There are probably an average of at least one million<br>
simulatneous phone calls in europe at any time. This is 500 megabytes (4 gigabits)<br>
per second, requiring 43.2 terabytes of storage per day. the compression would<br>
require roughly one million very competent DSPs. automatic keyword recognition<br>
equipment would require at least an additional 2 miooion DSPs.<br>
<p>
I might believe that NSA attempts to intercept as much military microwave voice<br>
as they possibly can in Russia, and that they used to do a lot more of that in<br>
eastern Europe, but modern commercial landlines are a different story entirely.<br>
