The distinction between "linguistic thought itself"<br>
and "the ideas thought in it" is important.<br>
<p>
Deep pemes are inherent in "linguistic thought itself."<br>
To clear deep pemes from your brain, you not only have<br>
to change certain ideas, you have to question, attack,<br>
and destroy the "vessels that contain" the ideas, so to<br>
speak.<br>

Brain researchers find 'God module'<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
Los Angeles Times<br>
<p>
NEW ORLEANS -- No one knows why humanity felt its<br>
first religious stirrings, but researchers at<br>
University of California, San Diego, reported<br>
Tuesday that the human brain may be hard-wired<br>
to hear the voice of heaven.<br>
<p>
In an experiment with patients suffering from<br>
an unusual form of epilepsy, researchers at the<br>
UC San Diego brain and perception laboratory<br>
determined that the parts of the brain's temporal<br>
lobe -- which the scientists dubbed the "God<br>
module" -- may  affect how intensely a person<br>
responds to religious beliefs.  The researchers<br>
said the experiment was the first effort to<br>
address the  neural basis of religious<br>
expression.<br>
<p>
People suffering this type of seizure have reported<br>
intense mystical and religious experiences as part<br>
of their attacks but also are ususually preoccupied<br>
with mystical thoughts between seizures.  That led<br>
the researchers to use the patients as a way of<br>
investigating the relationship between the physical<br>
structure of the brain and spiritual experiences.<br>
<p>
The researchers determined that one effect of the<br>
patients' seizures was to strengthen their  brain's<br>
involuntary response to religious words, which led<br>
the  scientists to suggest a portion of the brain<br>
was attuned to ideas about a supreme being.<br>
<p>
"It is not clear why such dedicated neural machinery<br>
... for religion may have evolved," the team reported<br>
Tuesday at a meeting of the Society for Neuroscience<br>
in New Orleans.  One possibility, the scientists<br>
suggested, was to encourage tribe loyalty or reinforce<br>
kinship ties or the stability of a closely knit clan.<br>
<p>
The scientists emphasized that their findings in no<br>
way suggest that religion is simply a matter of brain<br>
chemistry.  "These studies do not in any way negate<br>
the validity of religious experience or God," the<br>
team cautioned.  "They merely provide an explanation<br>
in terms of brain regions that may be involved."<br>
<p>
Until recently, most neuroscientists confined their<br>
inquiries to research aimed at alleviating the medical<br>
problems that affect the brain's health and to attempts<br>
to fathom its fundamental neural mechanisms.<br>
<p>
Emboldened by their growing understanding of how<br>
the brain works, however, scientists now dare to<br>
investigate the relationship between the brain,<br>
human consciousness and intangible mental experiences.<br>
<p>
Craig Kinsely, an expert in psychology and neuroscience<br>
at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said:<br>
"People have been tickling around the edges of<br>
consciousness, and this sort of research plunges<br>
in.  There is the quandary of whether the mind<br>
created God or God created the mind.  This is<br>
going to shake people up, but (any conclusion)<br>
is very premature."<br>
<p>
Vilayanur Ramachandran, the senior scientist involved<br>
in the experiment and the director of the center for<br>
brain and cognition at UC San Diego, said, "We are<br>
skating on thin ice.  We are only starting to look at<br>
this.  The exciting thing is that you can even begin<br>
to contemplate scientific experiments on the neural<br>
basis of religion and God."<br>

Maybe the "god module" has a companion called the<br>
"government module" -- or maybe they're both part<br>
of a larger "external-authority module."  Maybe the<br>
phenomena of "god worship" and "government worship"<br>
have a great deal in common -- part of a general<br>
"master peme program?"<br>
