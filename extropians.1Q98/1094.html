Thanks for the rant, but like all of the liberal pundits running interference in<br>
the press for Clinton, you are completely missing or ignoring why this is such a<br>
big deal: He is covering it up, lying about it to the special prosecutor, to<br>
congress, and the American people. He apparently also has commited obstruction of<br>
justice, in trying to get the girl to not say anything. Thats called interfering<br>
with a witness, and is a felony. Lying about whether or not he did that is also an<br>
offense. I personally don't care if he lines them up 20 deep every day for a romp<br>
on the oval office couch. That is the least of his offences. If he did that with<br>
his campaign contributors, they'd at least be getting a service a bit more than one<br>
night on a lumpy 150 year old haunted bed<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; On what planet?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Did anyone else ever see an obscure movie called "Eating the Rich"?  Among a</i><br>
<i>&gt; variety of strange plotlines, there is the story of a high-ranking Government</i><br>
<i>&gt; Official who gets trapped in a sex scandal based on having had an extramarital</i><br>
<i>&gt; affair.  The person who sets him up hopes, of course, that this will ruin the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Official and force him from office.  Except in that story, the trap backfires.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Official's popularity soars like never before, as the Tabloids run story</i><br>
<i>&gt; after story about how the Official "gets his little bit on the side."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've always loved that line, and wish it were more like that in this country.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Does anyone, in this day and age, actually believe that a guy like Clinton is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a wife-loving family man?  That he could possibly resist the allure of</i><br>
<i>&gt; sex brought by the mystique of being powerful?  Of course not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But once it's out in the open, well, then we'd better hang him, eh?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;/RANT&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; Sorry for taking up bandwidth with nothing more than a complaint.</i><br>
