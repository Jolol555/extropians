You will, I presume, explain why I somehow have responsibility for the <br>
actions of fifteen idiots? And why that 'badge of shame' also applies to <br>
those transhumanists who backed you up?<br>

Ok, to reiterate: I said that claiming that there was some magical <br>
age (somewhere between twelve and twenty-one depending on location <br>
and orientation) before which no-one could give consent to sex  and <br>
after which everyone without exception was able to give consent was <br>
dumb, and that each person should be judged as an individual, and that <br>
preventing people from taking charge of their own lives when they were<br>
perfectly able to do so could cause as much psychological damage as <br>
forcing them into things they didn't want to do.<br>
<p>
Where exactly is this "completely unfounded in clinical psychology or<br>
biology"? You mean there *is* some objective standard for determining<br>
this magical age and even those who might by any other standard be<br>
considered adults are unable to 'consent' until they reach it? The<br>
mere fact that the magical age varies by nearly 100% between cultures<br>
should be a glaring indicator that it's purely subjective.<br>
