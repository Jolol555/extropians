: and the product of a point and a point is a line<br>
<p>
Nope, still a point: 0+0=0.<br>
<p>
: if a point isnt a dimension and a line is, what is a point?<br>
<p>
Neither *is* a dimension.  A point is an entity with no dimension<br>
(no extent, as Euclid said); a line is an entity with one dimension.<br>
<p>
: i very much think that a point is a dimension.  dimensions dont start<br>
: with a line, they start with a point i think, or maybe something else.<br>
<p>
What do you think a dimension is?  How do you start one?<br>
<p>
: if you had three points it would be a plane, and 4 would be 3d   <br>
<p>
Nope.  Three points *determine* a unique plane - that means that (in<br>
Euclidean or similar geometry) there's only one plane which *contains*<br>
those three points.  It does not mean that those three points, all by<br>
themselves, *make* a plane.<br>
<p>
: ....(if they were randomly placed within 3d space, but what if they were<br>
: randomly placed within a 4d space?<br>
<p>
Then they determine a unique two-dimensional subspace (called a plane)<br>
within 4-space, just as two points determine a unique line whether <br>
in 1-, 2- or 3-space.<br>
<p>
: What is a 4d space? time? it seems that would also include movement<br>
: and growth)<br>
<p>
Spacetime is, indeed, an example of a four-dimensional continuum.<br>
Other examples are more abstract.<br>
<p>
: It seems a point would exist within all dimensions.<br>
<p>
Yes, an N-dimensional entity can be embedded in a continuum of N-or-more<br>
dimensions; since a point is 0-dimensional, it can be embedded in 0-space<br>
(itself), 1-space, 2-space, 3-space, ...<br>

: the answer to danny's original question is "no", because you need no<br>

: never shows up.<br>
: Sigh, that doesn't sound clear enough either.<br>
<p>
Clear enough that I wish I'd said it.<br>
<p>
To state the position of a point in normal space requires 3 measurements.<br>
To state the position of a point in a plane requires 2 measurements.<br>
To state the position of a point in a line requires 1 measurement.<br>
To state the position of a point in a point ...<br>
