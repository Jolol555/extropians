No idea of significance is very original.  FM-2030 may have<br>
taken the ancient idea of transhumanism to a new level, and<br>
I think various extropians and others have taken it much <br>
further.  Besides, sometimes repackaging an old idea is a<br>
stroke of genius.<br>

<i>&gt; Extropian art?  I've just do not get it.  What is the</i><br>

<p>
I don't get extropic or transhumanist art either.  Maybe because<br>
I love art because I love experiencing art, not because I'm<br>
looking for an ideology booster.  Maybe because I haven't seen<br>
any attempts at multimedia or high tech art that did anything<br>
for me.  Maybe because I can't believe a transhuman culture could<br>
possibly agree on a representative art -- I'd expect incredible<br>
diversity instead.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Extropa-groups (or whatever the living communities are called).</i><br>
<i>&gt; My wife and my children as a unit, we strive for self-improvement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We actively seek to prepare ourselves for the future.  But we</i><br>
<i>&gt; do not feel the need to use embody our "community" with a term</i><br>
<i>&gt; to illustrate this.  What point does calling a group "extropa-</i><br>
<i>&gt; something" serve?  More on this below.</i><br>
<p>
I find extropic communities very interesting.  Social and family<br>
life are extremely important to most people.  If this part of<br>
life can be improved through conscious design and experimentation,<br>
why not?  That's not to say that a traditional family unit (define<br>
however you want) can't be extropic.  This has little to do with<br>
extropian nexi, but I do think that the most extropic thing for<br>
millions of people to do would be to get out of violent and<br>
demeaning relationships and families.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Sex and fashion.  I visited the transhuman.org site (which I</i><br>
<p>
Fashion: see art, mostly.  I personally feel that wearing<br>
Nike, Calvin Klein, etc. logos is equivalent to wearing a sign<br>
that says "I am utterly stupid and boring".<br>
<p>
Sex: I don't know what extropic sex could be other than safe and<br>
satisfying, but sex is a driving force for most of humanity, and<br>
I certainly think that undestanding this major part of your life<br>
could be considered extropic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      "please keep the level of cultishness and bullshit down"</i><br>
<p>
"Amen".  Actually one of the things I find attractive about<br>
extropians is that most are very hard nosed realists.  The signal<br>
to bullshit/crackpot/fantasy ratio coming from extropians is<br>
incredibly high.<br>
