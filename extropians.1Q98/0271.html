Here's a solution that is already here.<br>
<p>
J.D. Krystall, Inc, in Issaquah, WA, has been working for several years,<br>
in a project with WSU and the Energy Dept in developing furnaces that<br>
burn propane or natural gas, and use GaAs/An composite solar cells to<br>
generate electricity. The original application was for a hubrid car, but<br>
the company is developing all sorts of products that are in testing,<br>
including a combination camp stove/heater/generator, a furnace/generator<br>
for the home that recesses into the wall, and others. The solar cells<br>
are 35% efficient when exposed to the high intensity visible and IR<br>
radiation of the burning fuels, and the hot exhaust gasses can then be<br>
used for heating purposes, which can be force driven by electric fans<br>
powered by the solar cells.<br>
