In a message dated 98-03-31 18:25:56 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I'm starting to feel really strange continuing this conversation about<br>
Martians<br>
 on the Extropian list.<br>
 <br>
 John, I am very sympathetic to your opinion. I'm also not saying that we<br>
should<br>
 start going hysterical about little Martians building humanoid statues. What<br>
do<br>
 we know about Human history? We have that damn Sphinx. Now dated at nearly<br>
 10,000 years old. There seems to be no evidence that we even had a<br>
civilization<br>
 that could build the thing. (at least no artifacts to prove it)  What if our<br>
 ancient history was radically different than we'd like to think it is??<br>

hi<br>
<p>
they've recently found evidence of watercraft traveling 800,000 years ago, not<br>
becuase they found a watercraft but because they found settlements on an<br>
island.<br>
i read this in www.scienceweek.com<br>
