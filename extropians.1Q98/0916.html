That's true, but it causes another paradox. If we look at a galaxy 15 billion <br>
light years away and then look at another galaxy in the opposite direction <br>
that is also 15 billion years away, and if the universe is only 15 billion  <br>
years old and has always expanded at the present rate, then the two galaxies <br>
could NEVER have had anything to due with each other. The trouble is that we <br>
can see that the two look very similar to each other, and the laws of physics <br>
seem the same in both places, that is, electrons produce photons in exactly <br>
the same way. How do electrons in such distant places know to act identically <br>
if they never ever had any causal relationship with each other?<br>
               <br>
The inflationary model of the Big Bang was invented to explain this paradox, <br>
it postulated that for a extremely short time in the very early universe the <br>
expansion was accelerating at an exponential rate, enormously faster than <br>
light. If this is true then the matter in our two galaxies was once close <br>
enough for light to travel between them, and that explains why the galaxies<br>
are so similar even today. <br>
               <br>
Inflation also predicts that the universe should be right on the knife edge <br>
between eternal expansion and collapse. According to inflation the universe <br>
will not collapse, it will slow down but never completely stop expanding, <br>
it will not grow arbitrarily large. The very recent experimental evidence <br>
that the expansion is unbounded is NOT consistent with inflation theory.<br>
If the evidence holds up the theory is in deep trouble and it's back to the <br>
drawing board.<br>
