Personally I'm having an amusing time watching my socialist acquaintances<br>
who voted for Tony Blair have fits because he's taking the British welfare<br>
state apart; something the supposedly capitalist Tories always talked<br>
about but were too scared to actually do. Frankly, anyone who still<br>
believes that socialism stands a whelk's chance in hell should be looking<br>
very closely at what the 'socialists' are doing in the UK.<br>

<p>
My personal opinion is that with the rise of industrialisation and the<br>
concentration of power in large industrial corporations, big government<br>
became a good way for them to maintain power. Add to that that people<br>
used to believe in socialism (which like other pyramid schemes actually<br>
did deliver to the first in line) and hence it wasn't as bad initially<br>
as it turned out to be in the long-term; people who believed in the <br>
system were much less likely to slack off and provide inefficient service<br>
or exploit the system than those who grew up under socialism.<br>
<p>
As people have got fed up with socialism and new technologies spread<br>
power around, government is increasingly getting in the way and <br>
proving unable to do anything worthwhile.<br>
