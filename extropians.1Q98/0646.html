<i>&gt;: Most extropians despise governments, but at the same time, they are</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;: perfect democrats. Because they really believe that democracy works</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;: way it is intended to work - they just think that this way is not</i><br>
right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well, let's have a show of hands. How many here believe there's no</i><br>
fraud<br>
<i>&gt; in democracy as it is, in your respective city or country?</i><br>
<p>
Perfect democracy I find morally repugnant.  The very idea that my life,<br>
liberty, or property exist at the whim of my neighbors, or that I have<br>
any say at all in theirs, is contrary to my most cherished beliefs.  I<br>
do not consider anyone a serious Extropian unless ey is fighting against<br>
both death /and/ taxes (ironically, Mark Twain is an ancestor of mine).<br>
Democracy and freedom are contradictory.  Extropians want freedom,<br>
diversity, and expansion.  Democracy encourages conformism, unity, and<br>
stagnation.  Democracy is deathist paradise.<br>
<p>
Reluctantly, I vote--an act of violence I am forced to commit in self-<br>
defense against the present government.  But don't think for one moment<br>
that I don't live for the day when there will be nothing to vote for.<br>
Rand may have gotten some of the details wrong, but she did leave us<br>
with the most beautiful words I've ever seen in the English languauge:<br>
"I swear by my life and my love for it that I will never live for the<br>
sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."<br>
