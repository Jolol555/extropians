Apart from the raw entertainment value, this is an instance of deliberate<br>
memetic engineering. Btw, TBTF is almost uniformly enjoyable for the<br>
average weenie geek technophile.<br>

..Culture hacking<br>
<p>
  These folks will pay you to mess with the mind of the consumer<br>
  society<br>
<p>
    The rTMark site [20] is the public face of a shadowy organization<br>
    that sponsors and pays for acts of culture hacking. Their aim is to<br>
    "encourage the intelligent sabotage of mass-produced items." (The<br>
    name is intended to suggest "circle-R TM ark," and is pronounced<br>
    "art mark.") This is the organization that solicited and then paid<br>
    money to a programmer at Maxis who added kissing boys action figures<br>
    to the game of SimCopter just before it shipped [21], [22]. The pro-<br>
    grammer, Jacques Servin, was fired for his trouble but has bounced<br>
    right back with the Whistlesmiths Web site [23], from which he offers<br>
    career councelling for those dismissed for acts of product sabo-<br>
    tage. In 1993 rTMark orchestrated the notorious Barbie Liberation<br>
    Organization's GI Joe / Barbie voicebox switcheroo [24]. Read the<br>
    rTMark manifesto here [25]. Wired covered the emergence of rTMark<br>
    from its veil of secracy last April [26].<br>
<p>
    Incidentally, the Web host fof the rTMark pages is paranoia.com in<br>
    Austin, Texas, whose owner, as Zero Micro Software, registered the<br>
    domain name micros0ft.com. After Redmond lawyers convinced the<br>
    InterNIC to suspend the name, he preserved the joke page at [27].<br>
<p>
    Another prolific and lifelong culture hacker is Joey Skaggs, self-<br>
    described "socio-political satirist, media activist, culture jammer,<br>
    hoaxer, and dedicated proponent of independent thinking and media<br>
    literacy" [28].<br>
<p>
    Finally, a tip of the Tasty Hat to the Boston Globe, which on 1/11<br>
    ran an article (not online) profiling two software evangalists. The<br>
    article describes a game they play called "reality hacking": They<br>
    invent a meaningless jargon term, brainstorm a plausible meaning for<br>
    it, then drop it into business conversations. The point is to get<br>
    the term into play. Sort of like Jargon Scout [29] does, but less<br>
    aboveboard.<br>
