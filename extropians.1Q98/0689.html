<i>&gt; &gt; For example the new entry-level Ultra 5 workstation (Price: US$3895)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; includes: 270 MHz Ultrasparc-IIi, 64Mb ECC RAM, 4Gb Hard Drive,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 17" Monitor, 10/100Base-T Ethernet, 66MHz PCI bus ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; At these prices Sun may actually find a new audience for their hardware.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In what universe?  My home machine is a PPro Dual 2x200, 64Mb, 4Gb,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 20" monitor, 66MHz PCI, NT 4.0; I didn't pay $2895 for it, much less</i><br>
<i>&gt; $3895.  It's nice that Sun wants to compete with NT workstations,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but charging $1000 for their logo ain't the way to do it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I will grant that the price/performance is still a little beyond the PC market, but it fills a nice gap.  Professionally, I do a lot of work on Sparc/Solaris, but use NT at home because of the cost of buying a decent Sparc workstation.  This causes a lot of difficulties for me when I work at home, especially if I am writing code specifically for the Solaris platform.<br>
<p>
For software development, it is really nice to be able to work at home without making significant sacrifices because of serious cross-platform incapabilities (such as NT vs. Solaris/Unix/Posix threads), or application sacrifices (Linux is fine for portable Unix development, except for when I am developing binary extensions to products like Oracle, which happens to be a lot of my development work).<br>
<p>
Having a "reasonably" priced Ultrasparc available gives more freedom of choice to people who do consulting or software development at home.  If nothing else, this is a move the RISC vendors should have done a long time ago.<br>
