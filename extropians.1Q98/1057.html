<i>&gt; [In reply to Netscape's announcement of their release of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Navigator, including source, for free]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This takes cujones. I shurely hope that that they will succed. If they</i><br>
<i>&gt; do, it could change how software is developed for good.</i><br>
<p>
This is perhaps a bit courageous, perhaps a bit desperate, but<br>
also inevitable.  The age of proprietary software is over; the<br>
dominance of copyright is dead.  This is merely the first in what<br>
will become the new model of software distribution: the popular<br>
stuff is free, and serves to advertise your customized, limited-<br>
market, and service products.  Creative talent and technical<br>
expertise is the product, and with the instant distribution and<br>
duplication and open competition of the Net, it will be impossible<br>
for any company to sit on its ass /after/ development and rake in<br>
cash for yesterday's work.<br>
<p>
Anyone care to take bets on how long it will be before Word and<br>
Excel are free?  My money is on sometime before 2002.<br>
<p>
Though I am not surprized by the move, I'm shocked that it was<br>
actually Netscape Corporation who managed to do something right.<br>
Of course, they probably don't realize it, and will probably<br>
cling like drowning rats to the old model on all their other<br>
products, but I suppose there is hope.<br>
