   By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Correspondent<br>
   WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. scientists said on Tuesday they had<br>
been able to make human cells live longer by tinkering with their genetic<br>
material, providing a "fountain of youth" for aging cells.<br>
   The findings, published in the journal Science, offered hope of new ways<br>
to treat diseases such as cancer.<br>
   "This research raises the possibility that we could take a patient's own<br>
cells, rejuvenate them, then modify the cells as needed and give them back<br>
to the patient to treat a variety of genetic and other diseases," Dr.<br>
Woodring Wright, a professor of cell biology at the University of Texas in<br>
Dallas, said in a statement.<br>
   "This is a monumental advance in the understanding of the molecular<br>
genetics of aging," Leonard Hayflick,  professor of anatomy at the<br>
University of California San Francisco and the discoverer of human cellular<br>
aging, said in a statement. "The telomerase gene will likely have many<br>
important applications in the future of medicine and cell engineering."<br>
   News of the technology sent shares in California-based biotechnology<br>
group Geron Corp. &lt;GERN.O&gt; up four points on the NASDAQ stock exchange.<br>
   "We believe that the extension and perhaps immortalization of human cells<br>
will have many important applications for the treatment of age-related<br>
diseases," said Calvin Harley, chief scientific officer at Geron.<br>
   Wright and colleagues at the university's Southwestern Medical Center,<br>
who worked with Geron, used an enzyme known as telomerase. Produced by germ<br>
cells such as eggs and sperm, it affects the ends, or telomeres, of the<br>
chromosomes which carry the genes.<br>
   Normal cells do not produce telomerase. Every time a cell divides it<br>
loses a little bit of the telomere on either end of the chromosome. Wright's<br>
team found a way to make the telomeres grow back using the enzyme.<br>
   "Each time a cell divides its telomeres get shorter and shorter and<br>
shorter," Wright said in a telephone interview. His team proved last year<br>
this loss was associated with aging.<br>
   Now, they said, they proved you can stop the aging process, at least on a<br>
cellular level.<br>
   "Unequivocally I would say this would not allow you to live forever,"<br>
Wright said. "This is not going to be a pill that allows you to live longer<br>
any time soon."<br>
   He said the the natural process that kills off cells was just one<br>
component of aging. "It's possible that just like when you have a car and at<br>
80,000 miles you replace the engine -- you haven't made that car immortal.<br>
On average the car is going to run longer but then the transmission is going<br>
to go out or the brakes or something else."<br>
   But the finding could help individual cells live much longer. "Over time<br>
we hope this will have significant effects on the health span and eventually<br>
on lifespan," Wright said.<br>
   Wright's team used skin cells, cells from the retina in the eye and skins<br>
from inside arteries. All were able to grow back their telomeres and did<br>
not, as normal cells do, eventually stop dividing and die.<br>
   "They are still dividing," Wright said. They were also normal, showing no<br>
sign of becoming cancerous.<br>
   "I think the medical implications of this work are really profound," said<br>
Dr. Jerry Shay, who worked with Wright. "It will allow us now to take a<br>
person's own cells, manipulate and rejuvenate them without using up their<br>
own lifespan, and then re-inject them."<br>
   In other words, it could be the break that gene therapists have been<br>
looking for.<br>
   Gene therapy involves taking the cells of a person with a genetic disease<br>
such as cystic fibrosis, inserting the healthy gene and then putting the<br>
cells back in the patient in the hope that the manipulated cells will take over.<br>
   But the engineered cells are old by the time the scientists are through<br>
with them and often die off before they can do much good. Wright hopes the<br>
telomerase process can make the cells immortal and make them work better.<br>
