<i>&gt; &gt; As far as I can tell, it doesn't and therefore should not receive</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; not being fairly compensated, you can complain, stop working, or quit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Making unusual compensation compulsory after a certain number of hours is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unwarranted interference.</i><br>
<p>
40 hours is the generally accepted mark at which most people start to draw the<br>
line, as it then starts to become difficult to get the required amount of sleep,<br>
feeding time, personal business, and quality family time beyond this point.<br>
Personally, I don't mind working about 45 hours a week so long as the last 5 hours<br>
are time and a half, but beyond that, expect to be paying me a lot more. My time<br>
belongs to me, and the employer who thinks the can dictate beyond that point will<br>
be preaching to an empty seat. You want any more of my time, expect to pay for it.<br>
In this case, I have more stringent standards than the law. For people like us who<br>
have no difficulty earning a living wage, it is not a big deal. The law is to<br>
protect the marginal population from exploitation by sweatshops and farmers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think your missing a very important point here.  Regardless of what is fair</i><br>
<i>&gt; compensation or not, the fact remains that the company has *taken away* money</i><br>
<i>&gt; from a more a powerful group.  Because companies need IT workers more than IT</i><br>
<i>&gt; workers need that company, why haven't IT workers realized that they are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ones who really have the power?  You would think, that based on the IT shortage</i><br>
<i>&gt; trends, that IT workers would counter any company plot to exploit them.   Those</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the testicles in their hands control those who own those testicles.   It</i><br>
<i>&gt; just makes plain economic and political sense.</i><br>
