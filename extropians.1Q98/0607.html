        I think that the ban can be directly linked to the large amount of<br>
media attention that has been brought to the breakthroughs in cloning.<br>
Imagine, for instance, if Richard Seed and the ones who effectively cloned<br>
Dolly (their names escape me right now) had kept their developments and<br>
intentions away from the media; I think it is safe to say that there would<br>
be no bans...because it would not have been propagated.  It is because of<br>
Seed's (and his predecessors') desire for media coverage that the potential<br>
uses of cloning have been deemed "illegal" by the aforementioned countries.<br>
 Hopefully the creators of effective nanotechnology and other progressive<br>
breakthroughs will have a little bit more discretion when announcing their<br>
creations.<br>
