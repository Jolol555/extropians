<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Americana: Disney Japan is the most successful theme park on earth. The US movie<br>
industry generates more revinues overseas than it does domestically, and<br>
outnumbers foreign domestic movie production by multiples in almost every country.<br>
There are very few nations left in the world that don't have at least on McDonalds<br>
or Burger King. Of the top ten grossing/attended/participated sports in the world,<br>
at least three were invented in the US. Picabo Street is the most popular femaile<br>
ski racer among Europeans. Oh, yeah, we are just totally unfashionable.....<br>
<p>
The reason why the most rabid anti-statist here in the US would defend the US<br>
system so vigorously is that a) the US has been, if anything, anti-statist in<br>
general, at the very least to a greater extent than any other nation to date, b)<br>
we have repeatedly shied away from world leadership, until the circumstances of<br>
WWII demonstrated that nobody else seemed to be at all competent to do the job, c)<br>
though we could have used the post WWII situation to expand in an imperialist<br>
manner, the fact that we did not do so is rather indicative of the US's general<br>
demeanor, as opposed to the prior behavior of any other great power in history. As<br>
much as anybody else in the world thinks, most Americans, no matter how they feel<br>
about our government, know down to their bones that the rest of the international<br>
club has demonstrated a distinct incompetence for the job, and typically have<br>
demonstrated an incompetence in handling their own populace.<br>
<p>
Which is the main reason why most Americans are suspicious of the UN, since it<br>
puts everybody else on an equal footing with us vote wise, while we have been<br>
expected to foot the majority of the bill (as always).<br>
