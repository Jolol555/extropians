Lets try that again...<br>
<p>
 I am uncertain about the ancient origins of herosim.  However, I think<br>
analyzing heroism from a memetic perspective could prove fruitful.  Heroism<br>
appears to be respected most lavishly when the individual who sacrifices or<br>
risks a great deal does so in the name of an ideology or broad ideal.  Heroism<br>
in the form of protecting one's family does not seem as spectacular.  Actually,<br>
protecting one's family might appear more of a duty than a selfless act of<br>
valor.<br>
<p>
Memes that reward heroism might have an edge over those that do not.  Images of<br>
heroes inspire others to cling more vitally to a particular meme.  Memes may<br>
use heroes as a focus point to anchor their "hold" on a society.  The general<br>
idea is "If this guy, who we will idealize, saw fit to risk so much for this<br>
idea then the least we can do is continue to promote it."  The fact that<br>
heroism appears in virtually all social systems supports the idea that heroism<br>
was a very successful "adaptation" in memetic evolution.<br>
<p>
Perhaps with the rise of transfamily metaorganisms which in turn needed memes<br>
to maintain cohesion, the concept of heroism was created.<br>
