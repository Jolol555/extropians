<p>
Keep in mind that "your" property is only yours because the thousands or<br>
millions of people around you haven't taken it from you.  There is<br>
nothing in physical law that prevents them from doing so.  It is a<br>
semi-mutual agreement among those millions of people which discourages<br>
them from doing so.  Part of that agreement is that you must contribute a<br>
certain amount of money every so often or they *will* take "your"<br>
property from you.  You may not like the "State", but remember that it is<br>
the same "State" which keeps all your neighbors from taking "your"<br>
property.  Property "rights" are not inherent in an individual; we grant<br>
each other the courtesy of possessing property.  Nothing in physical law<br>
restrains us so; humans have just come to learn that it works out better<br>
for everyone (generally) if we pretend that people "own" things and<br>
respect that "ownership".  This semi-mutual agreement is part of the<br>
"State".  Other, similar agreements form the rest of the "State".  You<br>
may not like certain features of the "State", such as taxes and certain<br>
restrictive laws, and that makes it extremely easy to forget all the<br>
other aspects of human interaction, which are termed, "State", that<br>
benefit you greatly, such as the respect that others show for "your"<br>
property.  The "State" is not just the beuracracy; it is also our day to<br>
day conformity to laws and other expected behaviors.  <br>
<p>
The hope of Extropians is to make our semi-mutual agreements more<br>
beneficial to all involved.<br>
