I've just completed reading a book by Charles Sheffield called "Tomorrow and<br>
Tomorrow".(SF)  It was readable.  It was about the future.  The rest of the<br>
future.  All of it.   Until the BIG CRUNCH.  (a closed universe scenario).<br>
<p>
What was most interesting about the book in my opinion was the Appendix. &lt;yes<br>
I read the appendices...also the footnotes..and the copyright for that<br>
matter.....you have no IDEA how boring it can be in a truckstop&gt; in which Mr.<br>
Sheffield more or less "summarized" the state of modern scientific opinion and<br>
presented a little historical perspective to support his summary.<br>
<p>
In it he mentioned James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth" and uniformitarianism<br>
in geology.  ".......in spite of it's ugly name, is a beautiful and simple<br>
idea........THE PROCESS THAT BUILT THE WORLD IN THE PAST ARE EXACTLY THOSE AT<br>
WORK TODAY...."<br>
<p>
Sheffield further says...."The great advantage of ..........theory is that it<br>
removes the need for assumptions"<br>
<p>
Sheffield goes on to explain that this (no assumptions....) was  fundamental<br>
in moving away from the creationist view toward the modern view.<br>
<p>
My thought is that it hasn't fundamentally changed at all.  What the Relegious<br>
Right call "God"...is now called "the big Bang"... <br>
<p>
By that I mean...the Relegious assume a singular event...never to be<br>
replicated...as does modern cosmology....only the names have been changed to<br>
protect the innocent.<br>
<p>
Skipping ahead a bit...Sheffield says...in regard to the Red Shift (the<br>
genesis for the idea of the big bang) ..."the most plausible mechanism, to a<br>
physicist, is the doppler effect'  <br>
<p>
Oh?  That implies there are OTHER mechanisms?  I wonder what they are?<br>
<p>
All this leads me to wonder if perhaps Eric Lerners "The Big Bang Never<br>
Happened"  might perhaps be given more credibility.  I've read it a couple of<br>
times and it appears to make sense to me.  <br>
<p>
No assumptions...what is...IS.   The same mechanisms working today as they did<br>
in the past.  "Universe forever...without end...amen"<br>
