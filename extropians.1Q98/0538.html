===<br>
Nothing worth doing is completed in our lifetime; <br>
therefore we must be saved by hope.<br>
Nothing true or beautiful or good makes sense in any immediate <br>
historical context; therefore we must be saved by faith. <br>
Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone;<br>
therefore we are saved by love. <br>
Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971) <br>

<i>&gt; Respecting the statement on the Extropy Web site's</i><br>
<i>&gt; FAQ that religion is "a touchy subject", I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; resisted until now expressing this, but I would like</i><br>
<i>&gt; to briefly support what David Musick said about some</i><br>
<i>&gt; people's knee-jerk reaction to the God meme in all</i><br>
<i>&gt; its forms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It really annoys me when people automatically react</i><br>
<i>&gt; with vitriol when the concept of God comes up, even</i><br>
<i>&gt; when it comes up with a heavy dose of irreverance and</i><br>
<i>&gt; scepticism. How utterly boring their reaction is!</i><br>
<i>&gt; They keep re-hashing issues and fighting old battles</i><br>
<i>&gt; from centuries ago. The fact that the existence of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "God" is unproven, probably unprovable, and may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; rationally doubted has long been a consensus of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Western philosophy. That's old news.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Face it, since the God meme is as flexible as it is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; meaning to some "the indescribable absolute</i><br>
<i>&gt; underlying all reality", it will always have a place</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the meme pool. Why then do some people still react</i><br>
<i>&gt; so emotionally when the mere subject comes up? What</i><br>
<i>&gt; about it bothers you so much? Like it or not,</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious thought will survive into posthumanity. Get</i><br>
<i>&gt; over it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This 'God' meme will survive , will it thrive and prosper<br>
given enough time or even become a 'pillar' if one gives in<br>
to a 'God is Love' extention ....<br>
If one were to keep the progress of transhumanism / Posthumanism<br>
advancing on the straight and narrow and not have it terminated<br>
tragically or unnecessarily , one has to have non-destructive<br>
elements and relationship re-generation memes , imho<br>
