<i>&gt; Many millions of people like to boss other people around.  Why?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; We all like to get our way, but many people like to coerce others into</i><br>
<i>&gt; helping them get their way.  And some people just like the feeling of</i><br>
<i>&gt; power they get from having others obey them.  Coercion is a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; widespread phenomenon, and it is a very deep and ingrained part of human</i><br>
<i>&gt; interaction.  It isn't going to be easy to eliminate it.  Getting rid of</i><br>
<i>&gt; governments won't do it; governments are only the products of a coercive</i><br>
<i>&gt; society; the problem is not "government", but the coercive nature of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; society which created and supports government.  It's *individual people*,</i><br>
<i>&gt; working together to force their will on those who won't go along</i><br>
<i>&gt; willingly, that creates government.  *Individuals* are coercive, and they</i><br>
<i>&gt; form coercive groups.  But to eliminate coercion, coercive individuals</i><br>
<i>&gt; must be taught to be non-coercive, and this may take a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychotherapy, or something similar. If we just eliminate coercive</i><br>
<i>&gt; organizations, like government, coercive individuals will just form other</i><br>
<i>&gt; coercive organizations.  If we're going to stop coercion we must stop it</i><br>
<i>&gt; at it's source; individuals.</i><br>
<p>
Typically the people who think that psychotherapy is good (for everyone<br>
else), or that things should be such and so a way (for your own good), are<br>
usually motivated out of the best of intentions, and feel that they are<br>
somehow annointed to do so, no matter how conservative or liberal those<br>
people are, for the same reasona Columbus felt annointed to exterminate the<br>
Native Americans, for the same reason the Kennedy's are always in politics,<br>
for the same reason Lenin and Stalin did their deeds, and for the same reason<br>
religious nuts bomb abortion clinics, and Hillary tries to push health care<br>
'reform' on us.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Any ideas how to practically do this?  Self help books? (_Controlling</i><br>
<i>&gt; Coercion_: How Coercive Behavior is Self-Defeating)?  Lots of Internet</i><br>
<i>&gt; sites on the subject, with lots of information on how to eliminate</i><br>
<i>&gt; coercive behavior in oneself?  TV documentaries?  Popularizing discussion</i><br>
<i>&gt; of coercion?</i><br>
