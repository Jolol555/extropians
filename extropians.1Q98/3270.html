Personally I think that would be a good thing; I think we've already gone<br>
much too far towards of trusting computers more than people. I'm hoping that<br>
the whole year-2000 debacle will dramatically decrease people's trust in<br>
computers and governments.<br>

The very last thing I want to see is for Earth to degenerate into a world<br>
of stupid people ruled by stupider machines; which is one reason why I <br>
find the other thread on computer-controlled justice so scary.<br>
