<p>
I've made the following point in the past, but I'll say it again because it<br>
seems to self-evident to me and so opaque to everyone else.  <br>
<p>
What is the basis for this alleged contrary `something'/`nothing'?<br>
Contraries, in syllogistic logic, are statements such as `All X are<br>
green'/`All X are other-than-green'.  I know what `something' is - it's a<br>
convenient empty lexical slot that we can use to park... well, *anything<br>
particular* in.  Everything we see about us, everything we can conceive of,<br>
is something.  To imagine a given something removed is actually to imagine<br>
only its transformation into something else, or its physical or temporal<br>
dislocation.  <br>
There *is* *no* *`nothing'*.  <br>
<p>
Vacuum fluctuations do not arise in `nothing', but in a quantum field.  The<br>
paradox or deep problem of cosmogeny (given 20th century understanding of<br>
physics) isn't the universe's appearance as `something' from `nothing', but<br>
its failure to have reached `heat death' if it has existed in anything like<br>
the current form since eternity (and while Eric Lerner makes a brave shot<br>
at dealing with this I don't think he succeeds).  That's why some version<br>
of the Big Bang is so neat, especially if it takes the form of repeated<br>
buddings into new closed spacetimes.  In my HO.<br>
