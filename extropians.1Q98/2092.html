  IAN: This issue goes right to the nexus <br>
  of my theory of holistic identity in it's <br>
  physical expression. I think that it would <br>
  be proper to say that Newton's 3rd law defines<br>
  1 fact that has 2 components, or that it de-<br>
  fines one set (F) with two elements, or two <br>
  subsets, such that F = {+,-}. Obviously, ex-<br>
  pressing the conservation of force, the sum <br>
  of those two symmetrical elements equals zero.<br>
<p>
  It seems illogical to me to separate the two<br>
  components in this force symmetry because you<br>
  could never separate them in fact; like two <br>
  sides of a coin, they are two and yet one. <br>
<p>
  That's the core of holistic identity. That's <br>
  the principle upon which I propose that the <br>
  number 1 is a single concept that poses two <br>
  attributes, 1 and -1 relative to 0 -- and <br>
  0,1 is the primary identity relation. Such a<br>
  unity of symmetrical components is, I believe,<br>
  the central structure of identity, as it is <br>
  expressed both logically and physically. It<br>
  is expressed here in the 0,1 identity matrix:<br>
<p>
                     0  1<br>
                    ______<br>
                 0 | 0  1 |<br>
<i>                   |      |</i><br>
                 1 |-1  0 |<br>
                   --------<br>
<p>
  Just as force is 1 fact with 2 elements, <br>
  the concept of the number 1 is 1 fact<br>
  with 2 symmetrical elements and 0, which<br>
  is also the sum of the elements of force.<br>
  I see a beautiful correspondence of logical<br>
  holistic identity and physical reality herein.<br>
