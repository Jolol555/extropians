You do not understand the ramifications of what I said, and show a lack of<br>
understanding of the terms.  To clarify my stance, I will define the terms<br>
for anyone who may be interested.<br>
<p>
The noise floor is the limit of resolution of a signal.  By definition,<br>
there is no means to resolve a signal at resolutions below the noise floor.<br>
This is a function of the signal and is independent of how the signal is<br>
detected and/or stored, whether by digital or by analog means.<br>
<p>
Ideal analog signal detection/storage will always store a signal at the<br>
maximum possible resolution by definition.  (Note that real analog systems<br>
behave more like high-resolution digital systems than theoretical ideal<br>
analog systems.)<br>
Digital systems have a resolution limited by design.  That is, the higher<br>
the resolution you want to resolve, the more bits you have to dedicate to<br>
resolution.  Most digital systems designed today are designed to resolve to<br>
the limits of human resolution capability, which is roughly between 20 and<br>
40-bits depending on the particular part of the body in question.  <br>
<p>
Here is the catch.<br>
<p>
The *only* signal that cannot be accurately resolved by a digital system is<br>
one where there is zero noise.  When the noise floor disappears, the number<br>
of bits required to accurately resolve the signal becomes infinite.  In this<br>
case you are correct that digital systems cannot resolve the entire signal.<br>
However, like Absolute Zero, zero noise can only be approached but never<br>
reached.  <br>
<p>
More importantly (and succinctly):<br>
<p>
The noise floor of the universe is such that all signals within this<br>
universe can be fully resolved in less than 100 bits, which is well within<br>
the capabilities of current technology.  Therefore, there is nothing in this<br>
universe that cannot be represented in a digital system *at least* as well<br>
as in the analog systems that are our brains.  And fact is, the noise floor<br>
for our brains is much higher than the universe at large, therefore making<br>
it reasonable to assert that digital AI's will be capable of<br>
detecting/storing information at much higher resolution and precision than<br>
any human due to differences in the noise floors.  <br>
<p>
<p>
NOTE:  One factor that I did neglect to mention is dynamic range.  While not<br>
an issue for the theoretical "ideal analog system", real analog systems<br>
actually behave exactly like high-precision digital systems in this respect.<br>
