And speaking of Greg Bear's SLANT, as Max did a moment ago:<br>
<p>
=====================<br>
<p>
`[Torino] thinks there's a world-spanning bacterial mind,' Nathan says<br>
lightly.<br>
<p>
`A *mind*, in germs?'...<br>
<p>
`Not like a human mind, or even like Jill [an AI thinker], not socially<br>
self-aware.  He thinks every bacterium is a node in a loosely connected<br>
network.  That would make them parts of the largest distributed network<br>
anywhere - on Earth, at least.'<br>
<p>
=====================<br>
<p>
An intelligence you can't debug!<br>
<p>
I wonder from time to time whether memetic meta-organisms might not be<br>
running an entire slow, massively distributed and time-sharing kind of<br>
ecology inside human brains/minds, so that each brain's modular structure<br>
is itself MIP-snatched by fleeting computations *from different<br>
interpenetrating critters* that operate, fairly fuzzily and with a lot of<br>
noise-repair required, via *patterns* of speech and other semiotic<br>
behaviour.  In a sense we'd be infested not just by collective moods and<br>
fashions but by large-scale mind-animals that cross and merge and sometimes<br>
contest within each single head.  <br>
<p>
Perhaps this is just a restatement of the basic meme postulate, but I have<br>
a hunch that it might be more than that.  But then I can only suspect this<br>
while I'm being run by a mind-parasite that wants me to think so...<br>
