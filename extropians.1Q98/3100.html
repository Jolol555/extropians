Since none of the more qualified linguists here have pointed<br>
this out, I'd like to remind everyone that "das Maedchen"<br>
(the German word for "girl", which is neuter) is not as odd<br>
as it seems: gender belongs to the /word/, not its referent.<br>
If the young girl were married, she would be both "die Frau"<br>
[fem] and "das Maedchen" [neu] without contradiction, just<br>
as in Spanish one might call the same pen "la pluma" [fem]<br>
and "el boligrafo" [mas] without implying that the pen had<br>
undergone a sex change.  Certain words have gender based on<br>
their form alone: German words ending in "keit" and Spanish<br>
words ending in "cion" are all feminine (e.g. the Spanish<br>
"la ereccion" [fem] -- the erection).<br>
<p>
Of course, such languages do tend to use masculine and<br>
feminine nouns for male- and female-related concepts<br>
respectively, so there probably is some long-forgotten<br>
cultural reason for das Maedchen.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, pronouns are a problem with every major<br>
modern language.  Traditional Chinese was one of the few<br>
major languages in which one could write a long story<br>
without ever revealing the gender of any character, but<br>
the language was, alas, "modernized" in the 60s by giving<br>
it the same gender bias as western languages.<br>
<p>
ObLojbanPlug: Lojban, of course, has no gender-specific<br>
pronouns at all; in fact, it has no human-specific ones<br>
either.  One would say "ta barda" whether the large thing<br>
you were pointing to was a man, woman, dog, or truck.<br>
