Nick, et co.,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Hello everybody! On the WTA action list we have been discussing an </i><br>
<i>&gt;updated formulation of a set of transhumanist principles. The latest </i><br>
<i>&gt;version is as follows. Comments and suggestions are welcome...</i><br>
<p>
Your work has much to commend it.  I am not sure that it qualifies as a<br>
statement of *principles*, however.  Perhaps you ought to consider calling it<br>
something else--a declaration, maybe, or a statement of policy.<br>
<p>
I here offer an analysis of your rhetoric.  Please understand that I aim<br>
merely at the rhetoric--not the substance--of your work.  The substance looks<br>
fairly good (but see my comments to the last paragraph).<br>
<p>
Paragraph one merely makes a predictive claim: Here comes radical change.  As<br>
such, then, it doesn't sound like a statement of principle.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(1) Humanity will be radically changed by technology in the future. We</i><br>
<i>&gt;foresee the feasibility of redesigning the human condition, including</i><br>
<i>&gt;such parameters as the inevitability of ageing, limitations on human</i><br>
<i>&gt;and artificial intellects, unchosen psychology, suffering, and our</i><br>
<i>&gt;confinement to the planet earth.</i><br>
<p>
Para. (2) makes a normative claim; it probably qualifies as a statement of<br>
principle, though even here the moderate and policy-oriented flavor of the<br>
statement makes "principle" sound a bit too strong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(2) Serious effort should put into understanding these coming</i><br>
<i>&gt;developments and their long-term consequences.</i><br>
<p>
Paragraphs (3) and (4) offer descriptions of transhumanist belief.  They<br>
clearly aim to advocate the beliefs described, however, and so perhaps qualify<br>
as statements of "principle."  Still, though, one might well expect a more<br>
ringing tone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(3) Transhumanists believe that by being generally open and embracing</i><br>
<i>&gt;of new technology we have a better chance of turning it to our</i><br>
<i>&gt;advantage than if we try to ban or prohibit it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(4) Transhumanists advocate the moral right for those who so wish to</i><br>
<i>&gt;use technology to extend their mental and physical capacities and to</i><br>
<i>&gt;improve their control over nature. We seek personal growth beyond our</i><br>
<i>&gt;current biological limitations.</i><br>
<p>
Paragraph (5) does the same sort of work as (2); the "on the other hand" talk<br>
makes it imminently reasonable, but arguably more of a policy stance than a<br>
statement of principle.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(5) In planning for the future, it is mandatory to take into account</i><br>
<i>&gt;the prospect of dramatic technological progress. It would be tragic if</i><br>
<i>&gt;the enormous potential benefits failed to materialize because of</i><br>
<i>&gt;ill-motivated technophobia and unnecessary prohibitions. On the other</i><br>
<i>&gt;hand, it would also be tragic if intelligent life went extinct because</i><br>
<i>&gt;of some disaster or war involving advanced technologies.</i><br>
<p>
Paragraph (6) sounds more like a call to action than a statement of principle.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(6) We need to create forums where people can rationally debate what</i><br>
<i>&gt;needs to be done, and a social order where responsible decisions can</i><br>
<i>&gt;be implemented.</i><br>
<p>
Paragraph (7) echoes (3) and (4) in terms of rhetoric.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(7) Transhumanists support scientific humanism. Though as a matter of</i><br>
<i>&gt;fact most transhumanists believe in individual freedom, transhumanism</i><br>
<i>&gt;in itself is politically neutral.</i><br>
<p>
Can you really defend that last clause?  Clearly, from what the rest of the<br>
document says, transhumanists should condemn a political movement that bans,<br>
say, scientific research.  Backing away from those earlier statements comes<br>
off as worse than inaccurate and confusing.  I think you would do better to<br>
say something like "transhumanism supports no particular politician, party, or<br>
platform."  <br>
<p>
To conclude, I would say that your statement is one of policy rather than of<br>
principle.  Perhaps you could call it the "Transhumanist Declaration" or<br>
"Manifesto" or "Doctrine" or "Affirmation" or "Testament" or . . . well, just<br>
check a good thesaurus.<br>
<p>
