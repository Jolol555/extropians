<i>&gt;Wei Dai said:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I can imagine some nanodefenses that would be effective against</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;macroweapons.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Bobby:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another way nanotech could help "protect" against these and other </i><br>
<i>&gt;macroweapons is by keeping a running tally of the state of your &gt;brain in</i><br>
multiple hard-to-destroy nodes in your body, possibly &gt;uploading deltas to a<br>
central site.  It would protect by &gt;providing all the necessary information to<br>
reconstitute you in &gt;the event of major trauma.<br>
<p>
Multiple and hidden backups of everybody spread about the earth and in<br>
space as<br>
well.<br>
<p>
Perhaps one has to eliminate the incentives for destructive acts in order to<br>
obtain stability.  Even if we cannot find out who committed a particular act,<br>
if the act doesn't gain the perpetrator as much as cooperative behavior, it<br>
won't become commonplace.  So if murder (destruction of information) and theft<br>
(especially of information) can be made technically near-impossible through<br>
backups, encryption, and anonymity, the problem looses it's energy supply.<br>
<p>
But, Anders is right historically, defense has never held out for ever against<br>
offense.  It is easier to destroy than to build.  Yet, still we live, after<br>
gaining many times the power necessary to destroy ourselves.  Sometimes I<br>
think<br>
we are *well* into the singularity, and things just keep slowly getting<br>
better.<br>
