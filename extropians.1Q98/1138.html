--Recieved message "Bill Gates Goes Global" from<br>
<a href="http://msnews.msbc.mscom">http://msnews.msbc.mscom</a><br>
<p>
Welcome to MSNBC Direct Mail(TM) service.<br>
<p>
Best viewed with Internet Explorer 13.08 Release 3<br>
<p>
Date:		29.Aug.2006<br>
Headline:	Bill Gates goes global<br>
Subject:	Microsoft<br>
Meta:		Microsoft, domination, conspiracy.<br>
Content:	Casual use of the word "penis."<br>
Reader Level:	Monkey, or above average Gazelle<br>
<p>
Today Microsoft has announced that it's new interface software, the<br>
Billagotchi(TM), will be released around the world within the next<br>
Microsoft Year(TM.  This will mean that the Billagotchi(TM) could be<br>
in your Den(TM) by the end of 2011.  But what will this mean for Bill<br>
Gates after 1999's Whitehouse scandal?<br>
<p>
--History File - Clinton vs. Gates - 13.Feb.1999<br>
<p>
	In 1998 Microsoft(R) realeased a new "open" strategy to counter<br>
Netscapes new-found success in the Internet(TM) market after releasing<br>
it's browser source code.  Microsoft(R) did not only release source<br>
code for Internet Explorer(TM), Internet Information Server(TM), and<br>
Office(TM), but also set a new agenda for it's business practises. <br>
The MS Open Strategy(TM) will mean that Microsoft(R) will release<br>
details of all previous business practises and all new business<br>
practises on it's website (WWW route directory (<a href="http://">http://</a>))<br>
<p>
	Visitors to the website were shocked to find pages of government<br>
bribes, mafia connections and, most shocking of all, a personal<br>
confession from Sir William Gates III about his connection with the<br>
1997/1998 whitehouse scandal.  The confession clearly states that the<br>
"sexual missdealings" of former President Bill Clinton were all a PR<br>
joke set to coincide with the release of Windows(R) 98(TM).  The joke<br>
did not go according to plan when Windows(R) 98(TM) was delyed for the<br>
16th time.  Along with the confession is a scanned receipt for a 1000<br>
mile long piece of string, that was allegedly attached to the<br>
Presidents penis.<br>
<p>
	Sir William Gates was quoted as saying "I just tugged on that string<br>
and out popped the little chap!"<br>

The Billagotchi(TM) software is an 6-inch high holographic agent<br>
modelled on the likeness of Sir William Gates (a Barney(TM) version is<br>
also available.)  The agent software will respond to any user requests<br>
and then achieve those requests by "aquiring" or "merging" infromation<br>
for the lowest possible price.  The 6-inch character is already being<br>
refered to as "Little Bill" by Sir Gates.  Shortly after Microsoft(R)<br>
made the annoucement Netscape filed a complaint with the MSDOJ(TM) and<br>
released a list of bugs (personality flaws) on their website<br>
(<a href="http://mswww.netscape.com">http://mswww.netscape.com</a>)  The MSDOJ(TM) have yet to take action,<br>
but are said to be humoring the request.<br>

Williams Gates was knighted by the British Empire after Microsoft's<br>
hostile takeover of the British monarchy (07.Apr.2002)<br>
