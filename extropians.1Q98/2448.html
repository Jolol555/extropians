So the Netherlands, where the number of abortions-per-capita is an order of<br>
magnitude lower than in the US, is a cultire of death and the part of the<br>
American population blocking acces to clinics and atacking women as they<br>
try to enter, forcing their medieval morality on them is 'the healty and<br>
vital culture of life'?<br>
<p>
(taking a few moments to be profoundly sick - there that's better)<br>
<p>
I suggest that if sex was not such a taboo in the US, sex-educations was<br>
improved, condoms and the pill were broadly available, most unwanted<br>
pregnancies need never happen. Get practical, get real and stop forcing<br>
_your morality_ on women you haven't even met.<br>
&lt;/rant mode&gt;<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;As we slip closer and closer to a world governemnt of some sort or another,</i><br>

<i> &gt;culture of death.</i><br>
<p>
As I said before: You can always move to the Vatican, a country filled with<br>
enlightened spririts upholding what you call 'the healty and vital culture<br>
of life'<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The impetus towards world government is from oligarchs</i><br>
<i> &gt;concerned most of all with world demographics, the UN Cairo Depopulation</i><br>
<i> &gt;Conference made that abundantly clear. They must impose abortion, etc. on</i><br>
<i> &gt;everyone, there must be no alternative to the global unity they envision.</i><br>
<p>
You make it sound like women are going to be dragged into clinics by their<br>
hairs, kicking and screaming. The Cairo Conference was primarily about<br>
increasing the availability of sex-education and preservatives around the<br>
world. I can only hope you're not against this, since these are the 2 thing<br>
that have the most potential of making abortions unnessecary.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;As I have previously written, there is no compromise or accommodation</i><br>
<i> &gt;possible between extropic worldviews and entropic worldviews.</i><br>
<p>
Watch out who you're calling entropic here.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;&lt;Now you are forcing your definition of what a human being is on us.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;The reality is just the opposite, you and your fellow travelers have forced</i><br>
<i> &gt;it on us. We can't find a jurisdiction to escape it. In response to this</i><br>
<i> &gt;absolutism, we must organize and fight. This is memetic selection in</i><br>
<i> &gt;action.</i><br>
<p>
I don't see that, no woman is forced to have an abortion. It's _her_ choice<br>
and no one elses (that's why it's called pro-choice I think, but I could be<br>
wrong).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;&lt;A 2 week old fetus is not a person in my book, it has the potential of</i><br>
<i> &gt;becoming a person.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;And your book has been forced on us. A 2 week old fetus is a developing</i><br>
<i> &gt;person, just as an 80 year old is a developing person.</i><br>
<p>
You postulate this again and again without further substanciation, I _you_<br>
feel a 2 week old fetus is a human, great, don't have an abortion should<br>
you get pregnant. Leave other people alone to make up their own mind. Even<br>
if they're not rocketscientitst or philosopy majors they can figure it out<br>
for themselves.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&lt;I don't claim to know what the definition of a human is but I'm pretty</i><br>
<i> &gt;sure you and I are human.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I do know.</i><br>
<p>
Then why haven't you won a couple of Nobel prizes or something?<br>
Do you even grasp the enormous arrogance of those three words?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&lt;I fully realize this is a mess from a philosophical standpoint, but then,</i><br>
<i> &gt;so is real life.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;My real life isn't a mess, I certainly can't speak for yours.</i><br>
<p>
My personal life is fine, aside from the fact that my mother might be dying<br>
of a brain disease and might be saved by an implant of compatible fetal<br>
nerve tissue.<br>
(something that wil not happen because resaurch has been all but shutdown<br>
in this field).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Nor is this</i><br>
<i> &gt;a mess from my philosophical standpoint, but I see clearly that</i><br>
<i> &gt;it is from your philosophical standpoint.</i><br>
<p>
of course, I keep foregetting that you have all the answers. Silly me.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&lt;It seems to be broadly accepted (in Europe anyway) and makes for a</i><br>
<i> &gt;_workable_ rule.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Europe is always at least a generation farther down the slope than America.</i><br>
<i> &gt;And workable for who, the slaughtered innocents, the victims of Europe's</i><br>
<i> &gt;genteel holocaust?</i><br>
 <br>
(to all other US listmembers - forgive my arrogance)<br>
IMHO European laws on abortion are a lot better than the US situation, just<br>
like our drugs legislation.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Arjen Kamphuis wrote 3/3/98: &lt;I don't think comparing womans clinics to</i><br>
<i> &gt;nazi-death camps is appropriate.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;The very large 'right to life' worldwide movement routinely refers to the</i><br>
<i> &gt;on-going tragedy of mothers murdering their unborn children as the</i><br>
<i> &gt;"holocaust."</i><br>
<p>
Then they routinely do not know whet they are talking about or use rethoric<br>
that's fairly obscene. Maybe this is why they don't get much support (?)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Not in America. In America, abortion is legal on demand right through nine</i><br>
<i> &gt;months, in fact, right up to having the baby 2/3 out of the birth canal on</i><br>
<i> &gt;its due date. No legislative process was involved in this, no consensus,</i><br>
<i> &gt;no will of the people, just top-down imposed death worship by five</i><br>
<i> &gt;unelected judges, stripping all sovereign rights that individual states</i><br>
<i> &gt;constitutionally have in this matter.</i><br>
<p>
This is something new (and _profoundly_ different from Europe).<br>
Maybe this is (at least part of) the source of our disagreement. In most<br>
European countries abortion has been legislated very precisely since it<br>
became legal. I don't know the number of weeks exactly (I think it's 10<br>
orso) but there is a strict line long, long before the fetus has developed<br>
far enough to survive outside the womb.<br>
<p>
Don't hold me, the British or any other European responsable for the way US<br>
law is made. It's your problem (and your above statement is true a pretty<br>
big one too).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;RJ: &lt;What's wrong with cannabilism?&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;AK: &lt;Nothing (did you see 'Alive'). The problem is the killing part, not</i><br>
<i> &gt;the &gt;eating part.&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;  </i><br>
<i> &gt;RJ:</i><br>
<i> &gt;On behalf of civilization, let me say "Ick!"</i><br>
<p>
Wich is very nice if you're in your comfortable chair in a well-lit and<br>
heated house but not a real solution to _real-world problems_. Pardon me<br>
for recognizing this a a trend in your answers. It's all great<br>
ivorytower-thinking but does not adress the mud of real-life problems.<br>
<p>
A 16-year old girl who claimes to have been raped by her retarded brother<br>
but refuses to press official charges and is 4 months pregnant is not a<br>
nicely, clear-cut situation. It's messy and the are no 'clean' solutions.<br>
Notheless these situations exists and have to be adressed.<br>
<p>
If you can come up with a practical, implemetable, solution that is better<br>
than "let the woman make her own choice after providing her with<br>
information about all the options and their consequences" Then I'd love to<br>
hear it.<br>
<p>
