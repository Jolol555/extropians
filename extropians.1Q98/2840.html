<i>&gt;This claim sounds implausible to me. If true, this fellow beats the</i><br>
<i>&gt;previous record by a massive 19 years. Does anyone know any more about</i><br>
<i>&gt;the credentials of this case?</i><br>
<p>
It has been mentioned in several books and newspaper articles, which<br>
unfortunately I don't have here to give the titles of.  Possibly a <br>
search of newspaper articles on a library database would give more <br>
details.  As I recall, however, this gentleman had a great deal of <br>
trouble calculating his true age, as records in his town were not <br>
kept well back then.  But by projecting it based on the details of <br>
his childhood, this is the number they came up with.<br>
<p>
I also don't know about that 140 estimate--I'm seeing 120 batted <br>
around as our potential lifespan, barring serious disease or injury.<br>
<p>
