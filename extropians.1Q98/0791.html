I've been thinking about this "Extropian Party" idea, and I think we<br>
should take a few things into account:<br>
<p>
1. People are stupid<br>
2. People are stupid<br>
3. People are stupid<br>
<p>
So taking these three points into account I have formulated the<br>
following plan for an Extropian Party:<br>
<p>
1. Rather than the usual Libertarian "everyone should be free"<br>
nonsense, I propose - "We should be free.  You should do as we say."<br>
<p>
2. Forget Democracy, Totalitarianism is the only route a modern party<br>
should take.<br>
<p>
3. Don't shy away from coercion - you're free (remember?) you can do<br>
as you please.<br>
<p>
4. We're not here to "make a better world" we're here to "make a<br>
better self."  Anyone who isn't a member is simply media fodder - use<br>
em and abuse em.<br>
<p>
5. Our campaign should be one of lying, cheating and media propaganda<br>
- in an election you can't stoop too low.<br>
<p>
At this point many of you may think I'm joking - I'm not.  So I'd<br>
better explain myself:<br>
<p>
By creating a system where everyone's free I can't guarantee that<br>
everything will go my way, there's bound to be some post-democracy<br>
fallout of people who don't know what to do, so they'll carry on the<br>
way they were.  Added to that are the people who are just inherently<br>
stupid.  So what we want is a Totalitarian society that rewards the<br>
intellectual (democracy tries to make everyone equal - big mistake!)<br>
and ignores anyone against it.  And before the knee-jerk "you're<br>
Hitler" mails come my way, Hitler (just like the majority of leaders)<br>
was trying to make a better world, I'm simply trying to make the world<br>
better for myself (a far more admirable goal.)<br>
<p>
So if you want to join, agree, or just make some *critical* analysis. <br>
