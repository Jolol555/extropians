I wrote critically of being concerned when people<br>
want to learn about a subject outside of their<br>
profession and just pick one or two books by a few<br>
notable authors and base most of their conclusions on<br>
those. Truth be told, I was jealous of not having the<br>
time to read complete books and having to rely so<br>
much on 'lighter' Web essays.<br>

After making my post, I had a number of personal<br>
encounters last week where the irrational behaviors<br>
seemed to confirm quite a few propositions of<br>
evolutionary psychology (I'm looking a little more<br>
favorably at some of these as a result ;-)<br>
<p>
As for the Pinker vs. Rose politics, I agree with<br>
you. This is the type of thing one more easily<br>
discovers in Web or journal forums than by slogging<br>
through a single author's entire thesis - too often<br>
they hit you with some soppy or socialistic<br>
conclusion in the last chapters!<br>
<p>
BTW, I slogged through the archives of the<br>
Autopoiesis List this weekend.  Lots of fascinating<br>
discussion there; BUT, my naïve estimations of the<br>
practical value of  the Theory of Autopoiesis have<br>
been chopped down a few notches (and I saved myself<br>
the effort of wading through any more of Maturana &amp;<br>
Varela's texts ;-).<br>
