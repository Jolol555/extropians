But *is* extropianism a movement?  And if so what is it a movement<br>
*toward*?  If Demi Moore were to start talking about cryonics or molecular<br>
nanotechnology on the talk show circuit it is possible that more people<br>
would sign up for the one, or would invest in the development of the<br>
other...  but just how this would be an advance for extropianism as a<br>
movement is unclear to me, unless we regard every scientific and<br>
technological development, as well as every cultural and political<br>
development in the direction of greater freedom and diversity, as an<br>
advance for extropianism as a movement.  Does extropianism just mean<br>
civilization, then?  <br>
<p>
I am not sure if it makes much sense to think of extropianism as a<br>
movement, given the forms it seems to exhibit most characteristically over<br>
the five years or so I've been looking it over.  More like a constellation<br>
of spaces in which a group of people discuss certain idiosyncratic<br>
preoccupations (most of which I share).  Usually stimulating, often<br>
useful, sometimes deeply pleasurable, but a *movement*?<br>
<p>
Is it the goal of extropianism as a movement to expedite the arrival of a<br>
technological singularity, or a particular configuration of future<br>
technologies, perhaps by way of the information exchange that happens<br>
here?  Is it the goal of the movement to insure that religious or<br>
ecological fundamentalism don't manage to stifle development of a better<br>
future?  Is the goal to disseminate as widely as possible the diversity is<br>
good meme, so as to give pause to the first Powers that emerge if it<br>
should occur to them that mehums look more like ubergoo feedstock for<br>
their transhuman engineering projects than potentially valuable<br>
conversational partners?  All of these would look like the agenda of a<br>
movement about the future properly so-called.  Maybe having Demi Moore<br>
talk about these things on Rosie or whatever would have a positive effect<br>
of the kind you are talking about.  None of them seem to have enough of a<br>
consistent articulate consensus behind them (except maybe the one about<br>
fearing the damage fundies could do) as the conversations on our various<br>
fora unfold, though, to suggest that they define the coherent agenda of an<br>
extropian movement.  Not that I think extropianism necessarily *wants* to<br>
aspire to movementhood, given the rather grisly track record of movements<br>
in general in this century.  It's just that the term gets bandied about<br>
quite a bit and I'm never completely sure why everybody seems so<br>
comfortable with it.<br>
