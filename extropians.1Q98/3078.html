<p>
Actually, it _does_ include a role for lawyers ["full legal assistance but only <br>
limited appeal possibilities,"] although they would be less powerful than<br>
they are now, just like most of the other members of the justice system. <br>
If one would be accused of a crime, he could hire as many people to *prove<br>
his innocence* as he pleased/could afford. The role of the lawyer would<br>
in fact be streamlined: he must present sufficient hard evidence to prove<br>
that his client didn't commit the crime(s) he's been accused of. No more,<br>
no less. Technicalities no longer influence the trial, but are settled in an <br>
independent one. False accusations, fabrication/destruction of evidence,  <br>
shall be punished severely (perhaps so that the false witness [etc.] <br>
recieves the punishment that the falsely accused would have recieved<br>
had he been convicted).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;, but, with all due respect, this seems like an unworkable</i><br>
<i>&gt; nightmare.  Most factual disputes worth trying in any court are so because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; facts are debatable, even by forensic experts.  Ultimately someone has to make</i><br>
<i>&gt; decisions of such disputed fact questions and any "electronic justice" able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make such decisions would have to evidence at least as much intelligence and</i><br>
<i>&gt; -- more importantly -- wisdom as a human judge or jury.  </i><br>
<p>
Human judges would still have a place in this system as controllers of the <br>
computers' verdict (other controllers are the defendant and his defense team <br>
or designated others) which is a simple summing up of the known facts<br>
with a recommendation (xx% chance that guilty of crime xx resulting in<br>
punishment no. xx). This system should work fairly well in all documented<br>
cases (audio/video surveillance), which should be more numerous than<br>
they are now due to a much more extensive surveillance network, and <br>
endorsement of personal cams/microphones worn on the body, in the<br>
house, tracking devices on/in body and on property items etc.) In non-<br>
documented cases things like (DNA) fingerprinting and other forensic<br>
techniques can be extremely useful, and often the criminal confesses<br>
spontaneously when faced with this kind of evidence. Furthermore there<br>
are lie detectors that, although still not too reliable, have an intimidating<br>
effect on all but the toughest suspects, again resulting in "spontaneous"<br>
confessions (just confessing isn't enough of course; details of the crime<br>
and things like the location of the body/stolen goods have to be revealed<br>
in order to sentence someone). <br>
<p>
The above is basically a process of ellimination: only a small fraction of<br>
cases* remain "unclear" after the cams, forensics and firm questioning<br>
have had their way. Apart from ongoing investigation (if someone can't<br>
be convicted within a reasonable amount of time [a couple of weeks or <br>
so] he is neither convicted nor aquitted, but simply sent home while the<br>
investigation continues. The suspect will be fully monitored while "free",<br>
since there is a good chance that he'll try to cover up evidence or <br>
otherwise incriminate himself. Threatening witnesses, bragging about <br>
the crime etc. also make one elegible for re-arrest and hard questioning.<br>
This means causing physical/mental nonlethal/not permanently damaging<br>
discomfort the suspect in order to extract a detailed confession (no<br>
words shall be put in the suspect's mouth, and a confession alone <br>
can't convict; details only known to the murderer/thief etc. must be<br>
forthcoming). The questioning is done under strict supervision of medical<br>
and legal experts and the suspect's attorney(s) and the whole session is<br>
taped in order to prevent fraud, and to serve as evidence in case of<br>
a detailed confession. Should it become clear that the suspect is in<br>
fact innocent, a reasonable financial compensation shall be forthcoming).<br>
<p>
The whole investigation trial is conducted in secrecy (but well monitored<br>
of course) so that the reputation of the suspect suffers minimal damage<br>
in case he's found innocent. Breaking the code of secrecy is punishable<br>
by fines, a large part of which goes to the victim (suspect).<br>
<p>
*[note: crime rates would be down considerably due<br>
to decriminalization of victimless crimes like drug abuse, gambling,<br>
prostitution etc. so that the police and justice system could focus all their <br>
manpower on the real crimes]<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; While crimes committed in thoroughly "surveilled" public areas might someday</i><br>
<i>&gt; be susceptible to more "objective" fact-finding than we have today, crimes and</i><br>
<i>&gt; intentional torts would just happen in less observable locales.  </i><br>
<p>
They would be pushed back further and further (from the shop to the street, from<br>
the street to the alley, from the alley to woods etc.) and many crimes would<br>
become impossible (to get away with) in the process. Wherever crime moves<br>
to, surveillance follows (be it private or state-controlled). Many crimes are<br>
location-bound (like robbing banks and stores) or impulsive (beatings by<br>
gangs etc.) and would be wiped out in a well-monitored environment like a<br>
city. Old people could walk the streets again at night, and shop keepers<br>
could focus on business once again. Sooner or later one could even let<br>
one's wallet lie unguarded in a restaurant or leave one's door unlocked.<br>
<p>
The places where standard cameras and microphones can't reach could<br>
be covered with surveillance (high resolution) sattelites, personal motion<br>
trackers, guns with auto-activated minicams (the right to keep and bear<br>
arms would further reduce crime, especially rape etc.) You never know<br>
who's watching, a great deterrent in itself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Unless every</i><br>
<i>&gt; square centimeter of every possible habitat is perfectly observed, committed</i><br>
<i>&gt; murderers or frauds will simply commit their acts in the least observed zones.</i><br>
<p>
Then those zones shall be covered too, until none are left. Also one could <br>
determine a suspect's location at the time of the crime by a process of<br>
ellimination ("where were you then at monday the 15th at 4.30 p.m., if you <br>
weren't at home killing your wife?" --"I was shopping in xx" -- "O.k, we'll check <br>
that right away - oh, by the way: the streetcams in your neigborhood have <br>
registered you at at 4.37 p.m. leaving your house in an apparent hurry")<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I agree that improved surveillance systems will and should be used in "hot</i><br>
<i>&gt; spots" -- predictable locales for crime.  One can imagine all sorts of clever</i><br>
<i>&gt; devices that would improve on the now-ubiquitous video cameras in places like</i><br>
<i>&gt; urban convenience stores.  (Here's one -- a system in the doorway that, upon</i><br>
<i>&gt; detection of a gunshot or certain key phrases, automatically fires a small</i><br>
<i>&gt; probe to extract a DNA sample and a cloud of microscopic tracking devices from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the next n persons passing through the doorway . . .)  </i><br>
<p>
An intesting idea. Especially if several prevention/marking/detection etc. systems<br>
are combined this should increase safety considerably.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But, anything less than</i><br>
<i>&gt; total surveillance of all possible locales for crime will still leave a need</i><br>
<i>&gt; for "flawed human witnesses" in any justice system.</i><br>
<p>
With ever smaller and cheaper surveillance devices (almost) total coverage<br>
could be achieved within a couple of decades or so. Even if you can't<br>
cover it all, you can still cover _a lot_, preventing and solving a lot of<br>
crimes in the process. If you can reduce crime in certain locations with<br>
even as little as 10% (50% would be more likely with (95%+ a real possibility)<br>
I'd say it's been worth the effort!<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I remain deeply suspicious of the concept of a completely "transparent</i><br>
<i>&gt; society" -- primarily for reasons other than the ones discussed here.  But on</i><br>
<i>&gt; this point, I doubt seriously whether the idea is any panacea for justice.</i><br>
 <br>
I would hate to see this kind of power in the hands of any present government.<br>
Transparency is only desirable if the justice system is reasonable, i.e. "anything<br>
goes as long as you don't damage others _without their consent"_. (otherwise<br>
you'd have to outlaw things like S&amp;M ;-) Also, society as a whole would have to<br>
be re-educated (through the usual channels like CNN, tabloids, soaps &amp; movies)<br>
to condemn only really damaging behaviour instead of harmless recreation.<br>
After all, we don't want transparency in the hands of religious fundi's: the<br>
Inquisition<br>
with the power of virtual omnipresence, perish the thought! :-(<br>
