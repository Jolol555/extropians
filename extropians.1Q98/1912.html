<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; about their private sexual lives? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
 IAN: I agree that they are not so obliged. It seems <br>
 to me that lies about private and consensual sexual <br>
 activity do not fall into the category of unethical, <br>
 since private means "off limits" by definition, and <br>
 therefore this whole affair should be off limits to <br>
 both the press and Starr. People going into public <br>
 life have to sacrifice many areas of their private <br>
 lives, but their sexual activity, so long as it is <br>
 consensual, is and should not be one of those areas. <br>
<p>
 That aside, of note is the fact that a few days after <br>
 Newsweek's Mike Isikoff reported that Clinton had an<br>
 affair with an unamed "former White House staffer" a <br>
 former White House intern, Mary Mahoney, was brutally <br>
 executed in the infamous Starbucks massacre.<br>
<p>
 The fact that nobody heard the 10 shots fired by the <br>
 assassins suggests that silencers were used, and thus <br>
 that it was a high-level job. What is more, no money <br>
 was taken from the cash register!! Mary Mahoney was <br>
 simply targeted for "termination." Here's some key<br>
 excerpts from two articles on this case:<br>
<p>
<p>
================================================<br>
THE WASHINGTON POST (07/13/97, A1)<br>
<p>
Coffee Shop a Fateful Stop on Three Career Paths<br>
<p>
By Sari Horwitz and John W. Fountain<br>
<p>
On the surface, the trio couldn’t have seemed more <br>
different...But all three -- Emory Allen Evans, 25; <br>
Mary Caitrin Mahoney, 25; and Aaron David Goodrich, <br>
18 -- had overcome challenges in their young lives <br>
and landed jobs in a Georgetown coffee shop. Each <br>
described the job to family and friends as a <br>
pivotal step toward a future goal.<br>
<p>
Instead, last Sunday night, in several horrific <br>
moments, those lives ended together. They were gun-<br>
ned down execution-style in the back room of the  &lt;---<br>
Starbucks on Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown, a <br>
trendy coffee shop in an affluent Washington nei-<br>
ghborhood that is seldom touched by such violence.<br>
<p>
D.C. police detectives still don't know what happened <br>
in that room sometime after 9:15 p.m. Preliminary bal-<br>
listics tests indicate that 10 rounds were fired from <br>
two guns in what may have been an attempted robbery. <br>
But police have said no money was stolen from the  &lt;---<br>
store, a point that haunts the victims’ survivors.<br>
...<br>
Mary Belle Annenberg, Caity Mahoney's mother, said <br>
that one day Chelsea Clinton walked into Starbucks. <br>
Caity was thrilled. She had worked as an intern for &lt;---<br>
President Clinton in the White House. But Chelsea &lt;---<br>
couldn't find any money. Caity reached into her <br>
pocket and bought the president's daughter a <br>
hazelnut latte.<br>
...<br>
Caity, the coffee shop's assistant manager, was <br>
first shot once in the chest, police said. She had <br>
raised her hands to her face, possibly to protect <br>
herself. A bullet pierced her hands and hit her <br>
face. Then she was shot in the back of the head. <br>
<p>
<p>
========================================================<br>
<p>
 IAN: Despite a $100,000 reward offered by Starbucks <br>
 for information leading to an arrest of the killers,<br>
 the Starbucks massacre remains unsolved. There was <br>
 a person who offered to provide police information <br>
 on the murders but before he could help, he was <br>
 murdered (Washington Post, 11/06/97). <br>
<p>
========================================================<br>
<p>
 The following is excerpted from: Strategic Weekly <br>
 Briefings, by Craig Karpel, January 23, 1998:<br>
<p>
<p>
According to my sources, when Monica Lewinsky first met <br>
with Vernon Jordan in November 1997 she told him she <br>
didn’t want to end up like Caity Mahoney. Jordan pro-<br>
fessed not to know whom Lewinsky was referring to until <br>
she identified Mahoney as the former White House intern <br>
who was murdered last summer in a Starbucks. The Starbucks <br>
murders were big news in Washington because, as D.C. <br>
Council member Jack Evans put it, "To have a triple <br>
homicide anywhere in the District of Columbia is an <br>
unusual event. To have a triple homicide in Georgetown <br>
is extraordinary." <br>
<p>
My sources tell me that Jordan gently told Lewinsky not <br>
to let her imagination run away with her and assured her <br>
that she was in no danger of being murdered on orders <br>
from Bill Clinton or anyone associated with Bill Clinton.<br>
<p>
And what of the unsolved murder of Caity Mahoney?<br>
<p>
A $100,000 reward offered by Starbucks hasn't caused <br>
anyone to come forward.<br>
<p>
The police have gotten nowhere. Virginia Mahoney, Caity's <br>
stepmother, worked for six years in the U.S. attorney's <br>
office in Baltimore assisting crime victims’ families. <br>
"I'm furious," she says. "If there's one thing I know, <br>
it's service to crime victims, and we're not getting it."<br>

 IDENTITY MATRIX | I D E N T I T Y    C O N S E R V A T I O N <br>
-----------------| The basis of  logic is  identity (ID). The<br>
     1  2  3     | basis of ID is difference. Degrees of dif-<br>
    _________    | ference can be quantified as ID units. The<br>
 1 | 0  1  2 |   | ID Matrix shows the ID units of three num-<br>
<i>   |         |   | bers,  and may do so unto infinity. The ID</i><br>
 2 |-1  0  1 |   | units of each  number are derived from the<br>
<i>   |         |   | others, and therefore ID is  holistic  not</i><br>
 3 |-2 -1  0 |   | atomistic. As the sum of all ID units unto <br>
   -----------   | infinity equals 0,  identity is conserved.<br>
