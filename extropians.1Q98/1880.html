Here is where I have to disagree with you. Everyone on earth has told a<br>
a lie at one time or another. That does not mean that everyone lies<br>
about everything or about most things, or that they will necessarily lie<br>
about really important things. It is possible that someone could lie<br>
about his sex life and be honest in all other areas of his life.<br>
<p>
I do agree with you that Clinton has probably lied about important<br>
things. But I do not base this opinion on what he says about his<br>
affairs.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The relevant topic at the moment</i><br>
<i>&gt; being a crying need (so he says) to bomb Iraq.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, of course.  <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And I am NO fan of big government.  I HATE it with a passion.  I AM a fan of</i><br>
<i>&gt; free markets...and agree that it has probably never existed.  It's all to easy</i><br>
<i>&gt; for some thug with a gun (or club, or whatever) to come in a pronounce himself</i><br>
<i>&gt; (king, god, pope, cheif,....etc.)  What I'm trying to do is point out that</i><br>
<i>&gt; government in general...this administration in particular....can't be trusted.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Because EVERYTHING they say is possibly...probably? (how do you know?)...a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lie.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

I don't really disagree with you. I just don't see how Clinton's sexual<br>
escapades and what he says about them leads you to this conclusion.<br>
