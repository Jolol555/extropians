Since several people on this list  stated that "Virtual Obsession" was a<br>
net loss for extropianism, I couldn't *disagree* more.  VO did more to<br>
promote and spread the idea of indefinite lifespans in 3 hours, what<br>
Star Trek has consistently failed to do in over 30 years.  In Star Trek,<br>
despite the fact that they *already have* the means to extend life<br>
indefinitly (transporter tehnology), continue to treat life and old age<br>
as normal, natural and worst of all as "the way it should be".  With the<br>
exception of other races, humans continue to live not much longer than<br>
100 years.  Anyone who knows anything about longevity should see this as<br>
completely absurd.<br>
<p>
VO on the other hand did what I call 'conservative infiltration' - which<br>
is the practice of validating to some degree what another is saying<br>
before you slowly manipulate them into your own way of thinking.  Had<br>
the show not taken 'religion' at all seriously and instead been<br>
completely extropian, then it would have lost much of its intended<br>
audience.  Keep in mind that more than 70% of Americans still beleive in<br>
god in the traditional sense.<br>
<p>
My point:  **This was not a show for the converted (us).**  Its purpose<br>
was to show the rest of the country that immortality, artificial<br>
intelligence and uploading are right around the corner.  In that regard,<br>
I think it did a very good job.<br>
