Hello all,<br>

I have a dejavu feeling with this one. I wanted to say something<br>
like this a few months ago. IMHO it all has to do with freezing time.<br>
<p>
Since you "are" a dynamic information entity in a atomic critical<br>
mass, you can only copy it "perfect" when it stands still.<br>
If this is recorded in a book or in a actual freezer doesn't mater.<br>
The fact that the process is on hold is (i think) very important.<br>
If you start it up again, you or your copy becomes dynamic again.<br>
I think this happens in a split second. Therefor If you die and are<br>
put in a database it will record a frozen part of memory-time.<br>
<p>
Asume they make copys of this, put them in a new body and<br>
start them up. For less then a second they will all " feel"<br>
exactly like the orginal, but after that they realize they are<br>
their own copy and therefor a new original. None of them<br>
will be the old you anymore. They are one happy family with<br>
exactly the same background (wich is in a sense what you are)<br>
I think in the begining they all feel that they are the original, but<br>
due to the time factor and the chaotic-thinking-part, they will<br>
all end up as identical twins.They are childs with fixed and ready<br>
to go minds.<br>
<p>
I think therefor that merging them again after some time is<br>
very hard (if not impossible), since you are talking about<br>
differn't persons.<br>
<p>
IMHO, the copy-paradox has to do with time.<br>
