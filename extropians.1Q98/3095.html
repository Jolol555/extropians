<p>
I think you are taking this wrong. I see it as a girl being pretty much like a<br>
young boy in childhood, then transcending through a 'neuter' state, to becoming<br>
a woman. SO if you consider that the only difference between men and boys is the<br>
size of their toys, well, then, women have already moved beyond that.....<br>
