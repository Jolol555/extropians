<i>&gt;</i><br>

Or rather, our perceptions of it. I think that the common perceptions about the<br>
meaning of these two words, which were once positive, now have a negative<br>
semantic value precisely because of luddite memes in our culture. I just read<br>
Wired 6.01. Great photo section.<br>
<p>
"Change is good"<br>
<p>
"Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you beleive<br>
that the future can be better, it's unlikely you will step up and take<br>
responsibility for making it so."<br>
<p>
"If you assume that there is no hope, you guarrantee that there will be no<br>
hope."<br>
<p>
"If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, there are opportunites to<br>
change things, there's a chance you may contribute to making a better world."<br>
<p>
"The choice is yours"     - Noam Chomsky<br>
<p>
How do we start spreading memes? The easiest way is thus: wear t-shirts &amp;<br>
baseball caps, and put bumperstickers on your car, as well as posters on your<br>
walls at home and in your office/cubicle at work that all have pictures and<br>
simple phrases that are catchy. I am always wearing my PETA baseball hat, (PETA<br>
in my case stands for :"People Eating Tasty Animals") and I get lots of<br>
feedback from people. Take out ads in WIRED and other mags with our messages on<br>
them (yeah that can get pricey).<br>
<p>
When are Exi t-shirts with "CHANGE IS GOOD" on them going to be available?<br>
<p>
Little things like this can go a long way in the social engineering department.<br>
