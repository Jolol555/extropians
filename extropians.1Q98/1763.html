<i>&gt; a world without privacy would show true equality amongst society.  </i><br>
<p>
Equality amongst society sounds impossible to me. Society places value on <br>
certain skills and talents some people are going to fall outside what <br>
society sees as good and thus inequal amoung society. Perhaps a world <br>
without privacy and society would show all as equal. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nothing to hide is nothing to save from the enemy. therefor all people </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be as one.  </i><br>
<p>
In my opinion this can't be so. No privacy means our most base fears and <br>
prejudices are laid out for all too see. The distinctions between groups <br>
be it religious, racial, weight based or any one of the host of things <br>
that divide society now would grow if the fear and negativity was shown <br>
in its true form making the divisons larger. The potential is great but <br>
humankind would only use the power for their destruction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; i agree with your statement but, i also agree that </i><br>
<i>&gt; equality is accomplished through honesty and trust</i><br>
