Why would a software user want to load and run software with an unknown<br>
number of modifications, all of which they must pay for individually, each<br>
time they use the software (if I properly understand your idea)?  How<br>
would a business budget for such an escalating, never ending expense.<br>
<p>
I have enough trouble supporting the software I have now. How would I fix<br>
and maintain software from a thousand different undocumented sources that<br>
work together in unpredictable (by me) ways?<br>
<p>
Why would a user (they pay for all software) want such software (even if<br>
it was better at some things) when they could get "good enough" shareware<br>
at a low fixed cost or "good enough" freeware (some of it excellent) for<br>
free. It would seem to me that the evolution you crave would favor the<br>
survival of these options at the expense of your component based "pay per<br>
view" software. (unfortunately, the world does not exist for the benefit<br>
of programmers like us, as you have no doubt noticed).<br>
<p>
Thanks for the interesting posting. I wish something like your ideas would<br>
occur as well.<br>

<i>&gt; be implemented.  But I have reason to believe this will not be a problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the future.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As the Internet expands, as bandwidth increases, as e-cash becomes</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard and as trusted systems become widely prevalent, I can foresee</i><br>
<i>&gt; much software being distributed through the Internet on a pay-as-you-use</i><br>
<i>&gt; basis.  The software will likely be component-based software, where each</i><br>
<i>&gt; component could be designed by different programmers, who are paid some</i><br>
<i>&gt; small amount each time their component is used (the cost of using the</i><br>
<i>&gt; software would be the sum of the cost of running the components which are</i><br>
<i>&gt; run).  This would allow someone who sees a flaw in some piece of software</i><br>
<i>&gt; or something they want to add on to improve the software, to make those</i><br>
<i>&gt; changes, and when people use the components that they have added, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be paid for it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm sure a lot of companies will still copyright their software and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; allow it to be modified, but I know a lot of people would encourage</i><br>
<i>&gt; others to improve their software.  Of course, then we'd end up with</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousands of different versions of one piece of software, at varying</i><br>
<i>&gt; degrees of quality.  This naturally leads to some sort of selection</i><br>
<i>&gt; system; people want to use good software, but they don't have time to</i><br>
<i>&gt; evaluate thousands of different pieces of software.  So they pay people</i><br>
<i>&gt; to do it for them.  I can see Web sites which offer really good software,</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a small fee, of course.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Basically, this could allow software to evolve much more than it does</i><br>
<i>&gt; today.  There is a real financial motive for programmers to improve</i><br>
<i>&gt; software, even if they didn't design the original version.  The original</i><br>
<i>&gt; programmers benefit from this public modification of their software since</i><br>
<i>&gt; most of what they wrote (and will get paid for) is unlikely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; modified much in the short term, at least, and any improvements to their</i><br>
<i>&gt; software will only serve to make it more competitive and used more often,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and thus they will get paid more.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The details of how to keep track of who wrote what and how to determine</i><br>
<i>&gt; pricing and how to make it difficult to get around paying for what you</i><br>
<i>&gt; use are somewhat tricky, but I have high confidence that it can, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; will, be done.  I look forward to that time.</i><br>
