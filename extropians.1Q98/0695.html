Here in Melbourne, Australia, it gets a small box this morning at the<br>
bottom of the front page of The Age, one of the nation's major metropolitan<br>
newspapers.  (The op-ed page has two contrasting pieces on the vileness vs<br>
the worth of cloning human cells.)  <br>
<p>
The telomere story featured on the news of the two non-commercial TV<br>
channels last night, but in about fourth or five place, following stories<br>
about drug testing of swimmers, the funeral of a murdered baby, and other<br>
earth-shaking stuff.  Still, this was quite good by usual standards.<br>
Hi-tech science breakthroughs and space events normally get the closing<br>
slot, after the weather and financial details, usually with a quizzical<br>
smile from the announcer (`What *will* those amusing and irrelevant nerds<br>
get up to next?').<br>
<p>
What did *I* do about it?  I e-rushed The Age a 900 word story [freelance<br>
submission] called `The last mortal generation', culled from material on<br>
telomeres in THE SPIKE and using the hottest info I could find on the Web<br>
(and thanks to everyone who posted the news here on this list).  It will be<br>
interesting to see if they run the story tomorrow or Saturday.  Go thou and<br>
do likewise if thou hast the verbal prowess.<br>
