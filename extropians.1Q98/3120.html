I don't think heavyweights can change grammar like that.  More importantly,<br>
English grammar doesn't resemble Latin very much.  German probably resembles<br>
Latin more.  What I've read is that our grammar resembles that of the<br>
Scandinavian languages more than anything else, a result of living with the<br>
Danes for a few centuries; apparently the Scandinavian tongues split off from<br>
Germanic in grammar, although I don't know whether English adoped Scand.<br>
grammar or whether the current system is a bastard of Old English and Old<br>
Danish.<br>
<p>
English has often been _taught_ based on the Latin model, which may be where<br>
the 'heavyweights' come in, and which probably gave grammar a bad name in<br>
English, precisely because it didn't apply.  Latin is heavily inflected with a<br>
pretty flexible word order; English has minimal inflections and much more<br>
brittle order, because that's what determines the meaning.<br>
<p>
If grammar is significantly different from syntax I've probably just totally<br>
embarassed myself.<br>
