That certainly seems true. The Gubbermint(tm) may have had an origin in<br>
the mafia, the mafia certainly converges towards the same state (anecdotal<br>
evidence, but then look at my current domain). The ecological niche<br>
certainly seems to be very real. Corollary: if attempted now, from a<br>
sudden power vacuum a a state very much resembling the current one will<br>
spring. The only way to combat this would seem to boost education, which<br>
is intrinsically difficult, the nature of your clientele considered. <br>

<i>&gt; I don't like facile generalisations like "government BAD" and "free market </i><br>

I dunno, it seems the attitude of the people has lots of impact. The<br>
reason current power semimonopoly in Russia exists is a function of<br>
recent-to-mid history. Certainly long-duration patches of strong state<br>
select for mindrot among its (granted, sometimes unwilling) subscribers. <br>
Globally/on the long run, strong state should have not much chance due to<br>
its limited competitiveness, however. <br>

<p>
Good ideas, and NOT extropy-rehashed until they are rotting carcasses? <br>
Utterly impossible. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; like it was in the old days, even _whispering_ the idea that government</i><br>

Woof! W00f! &lt;SLABBER&gt;<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; government employee trying to explain why what they do is _good_ ?</i><br>
<p>
Oh no, not me. Ah, wait, two Leviathans (M$ vs. AntiMonopolyTrust(tm)<br>
bashing each other, perhaps?<br>
