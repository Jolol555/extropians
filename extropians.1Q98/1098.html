One group that might be worth looking at was the Fore in New Guinea, whose<br>
females died in devastating numbers due to kuru (contracted from mortuary<br>
cannabilism, mostly practised only by females).  I think this practice was<br>
abandoned within a couple of generations of its fairly recent adoption<br>
after the arrival of Australian law and intervention, and before the link<br>
with kuru as a slow virus or prion was uncovered.  Oddly, the many diverse<br>
cultures in New Guinea were notably ferocious and warlike even in<br>
conditions of gender parity.  I get the impression that the deaths of Fore<br>
wives, mothers and daughters was altogether demoralising to the men, rather<br>
than cause for maddened war and wife-taking.  In part, perhaps, this is<br>
because the deaths were attributed to `sorcery' by other members of the<br>
Fore.  And of course this horrible episode isn't much like growing up in a<br>
society where boys have *always* majorly outnumbered girls.<br>
