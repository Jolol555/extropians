Talk about global warming. However, considering that most of the earths<br>
surface is water, even a drunk dart thrower in charge could put a rather<br>
large tonnage in the drink rather than on someone's head. The trolley<br>
sized ingot idea is the way to go. Merely dropping unrefined rocks to<br>
earth is highly wasteful. Use solar energy to power magnetic induction<br>
heated centrifugal refiners, as illustrated in Jerry Pournelle and<br>
Charles Sheffield's sf book _Higher_Education_.<br>
<p>
Better yet, why send any metal to earth at all??? Now that the Russian<br>
metals industry is open to the marketplace, metals prices have hit rock<br>
bottom, and since we aren't likely to have any huge world wars anytime<br>
soon (wars are great for eating up metals), rigorous recycling programs<br>
can help limit the need for new ores. Space based metal refining is<br>
meant to eliminate the transportation cost of materials in space from<br>
the present $2000-$10,000 per pound down to earthside commodity levels.<br>
DOing this will open the door for large industrialization of space.<br>
