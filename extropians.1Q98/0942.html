As Dan Clemmensen already noted, technology _is_ out of control in the<br>
sense that the development of technology as a whole by our civilization is<br>
neither controlled by any particular agency nor can it be known and<br>
understood in its entirety.  The same holds true for other creative<br>
endeavors: there is more art, more music, and more literature in the world<br>
than anyone can hope to be familiar with, much less appreciate.<br>
Furthermore, all such areas of creativity are the product of particular<br>
individuals pursuing their own goals and listening to their own muses; no<br>
agency or group directs where creative effort goes.  This is best so.<br>
<p>
The difference (or at least A difference) between the expansion of the<br>
body of the arts and the development of technology is that technological<br>
changes can have direct, profound, and unpredictable effects in all other<br>
areas of human life, with economic changes first.  Most people don't like<br>
change, aren't willing to change, and think of change not as an<br>
opportunity for growth and career advancement but as a threat to their<br>
rut.  Untill we (as a species) develop a social counterpart to an ESS, one<br>
accomodating ever-changing technology, I suspect this will remain the<br>
case.<br>
<p>
Moderately relevant annecdote:<br>
<p>
Microfilm viewers are not particularly advanced technology; I'd say<br>
they're about as hard to use as a car stereo.  Yet in the years I worked<br>
in my university library's microfilm department, I saw literally thousands<br>
of people who were plainly intimidated by those bulky screen-and-spool<br>
machines.  They were unfamiliar technology and therefore a threat to the<br>
ego, a challange to their ability to navigate the world and deal with its<br>
contents.<br>
<p>
I remember one particular patron whose viewer had repeatedly jammed when<br>
printing.  I suggested she try another viewer, a newer model and one less<br>
prone to jams.  She actually said, "Oh no, I don't want to learn something<br>
NEW!"  Excuse me?  Why are you in college?<br>
<p>

<p>
The widespread fear of change makes me wonder if widespread<br>
implementation of technologies such as cloning, genetic alteration of<br>
humans, IA/AI integration and dramatic life extension aren't going to have<br>
to wait until the colonization of the solar system has begun.  Space<br>
migration (and, to a lesser extent, undersea migration) will offer new<br>
opportunities for social experiements unfettered by existing governments.<br>
That assumes, of course, that one of the more eschatalogical models of<br>
Singularity hasn't intervened.<br>
