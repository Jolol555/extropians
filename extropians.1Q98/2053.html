    There has been some speculation that caloric restriction might be able<br>
 to retard the rate of aging, and extend maximum human life span beyond<br>
 120 years of age. (For example see the book "The 120 Year Diet" by Roy<br>
 Walford)<br>
    Recent evidence indicates that the anti-aging effect of caloric<br>
 restriction, which has been documented in rodents, is not operative in<br>
 humans.<br>
    A low body-mass index does have a positive association with reduced<br>
 mortality rates in humans. However recent research indicates that this is<br>
 due to a negative association between BMI and physical fitness. After<br>
 physical fitness is accounted for, there exists no further effect of BMI<br>
 on mortality. See the following table from (International Journal of<br>
 Obesity 19 Suppl: S41-S44 1995.<br>
<p>
                     All Cause Death Rates<br>
    BMI                    Fitness<br>
                   Low     Moderate   High<br>
    &lt;27            52.1      28.6      20.0<br>
   27-30           49.1      29.8      19.7<br>
<i>    &gt;30            62.1           18.0         (moderate &amp; high together)</i><br>
<p>
     While the above data indicate that the body mass index itself is not<br>
 a primary driving factor for mortality in humans, the case it makes<br>
 against caloric restriction exerting an anti-aging effect is not<br>
 air-tight. What is needed is a false prediction from a postulated<br>
 anti-aging effect of caloric restriction that could then be used in turn<br>
 to falsify that hypothesis. I believe there exists one such prediction.<br>
     Lower BMI is associated with reduced mortality in young and<br>
 middle-aged humans. If caloric restriction retards the rate of aging and<br>
 extends maximum life span in humans one must expect that a lower BMI<br>
 would be significantly associated with reduced mortality in aged humans.<br>
 If such an significant association is not found then caloric intake is<br>
 not operative in modifying the rate of aging in humans and life spans<br>
 beyond 120 will not be possible by reducing caloric intake.<br>
     In humans over 84 years of age BMI has not been found to exert any<br>
 significant effect on mortality. (New England Journal of Medicine 338:<br>
 1-7 1998 &amp; Arch Intern Med 157: 2249-2258 1997) Therefore since no<br>
 association has been found between BMI and mortality in aged humans, then<br>
 caloric restriction is not operative in modifying the rate of aging in<br>
 humans.<br>
     The fact that caloric restriction dramatically extends life span in<br>
 mice, but not apparently in humans requires some explanation. Here is<br>
 one. In mice caloric restriction is associated with torpor, which can act<br>
 to reduce tumor growth. In C57BL/6J mice blocking torpor, by increasing<br>
 housing temperature to 30 C reduced the increase in average life span<br>
 associated with caloric restriction from 47% to just 4%. Since humans<br>
 neither experience torpor, nor suffer from cancer to the degree that mice<br>
 do the effect of caloric restriction in mice can not be generalized to<br>
 include humans. For example in human centenarians only 4% die from<br>
 cancer. By comparison cardiovascular disease accounts for 63% of deaths<br>
 in those aged 95 and over. (Epidemiology 8: 501-504 1997) Thus it is<br>
 cardiovascular disease and not cancer that is the major longevity<br>
 limiting factor in humans.<br>
     It is possible that potassium intake may be a major dietary modulator<br>
 of human longevity. A high potassium intake has been found to reduce<br>
 stroke associated mortality to zero. (New England Journal of Medicine<br>
 316: 235-240 1987)<br>
