Use of large vessels as the basis for some sort of extra-national entity is a<br>
recurring idea.  One often encounters questions about costs in such<br>
discussions, but little data.  A quick web search this morning turned up an<br>
excellent article discussing the current economics of oil tanker ownership and<br>
operation:<br>
<p>
	OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF OIL TANKERS<br>
	IN THE POST-OPA'90 ENVIRONMENT:<br>
	An Analysis of Costs, Profits and Complications<br>
	N. Shashikumar, PhD<br>
<p>
		<a href="http://www.rigos.com/suny1.html">http://www.rigos.com/suny1.html</a><br>
<p>
Shashikumar discusses the current capital and operating costs for the four<br>
standard classes of liquid bulk carriers.  Below is a list of those classes<br>
and their sizes in "dead weight tons", the standard measure of ship size (a<br>
measure of the weight of water displaced by the vessel without cargo):<br>
<p>
	"Very Large Crude Carrier" ("VLCC") (295,000 dwt)<br>
	Million Barrel ("MM Bbl") (130,000 dwt)<br>
	Suez-Limited ("Aframax") (80,000 dwt)<br>
	Product Carrier ("PC") (30,000 dwt)<br>
<p>
To get a common sense impression of the size of these vessels, a PC is pretty<br>
much the size of a standard break-bulk cargo ship, while VLCCs are the largest<br>
true vessels afloat, dwarfing aircraft carriers.  Presumably VLCCs are what<br>
utopians have in mind when envisioning "floating free zones".<br>
<p>
Shashikumar's article provides the following figures for the cost of such<br>
vessels.  The following table displays rounded figures extracted from his<br>
article, expressing the cost of a 1995 newbuilding, the projected resale value<br>
of such vessels in 2000 and the cost of such vessels in terms of their<br>
lifetime capital and operating costs:<br>
<p>
			95 NB - 2000 Resale - Break-even<br>
<p>
	VLCC:	$100MM - $78MM - $140MM<br>
	MM Bbl:	$73MM - $56MM - $100MM<br>
	Aframax:	$49MM - $28MM - $62MM<br>
	PC		$40MM - $18MM - $50MM<br>
<p>
The following table displays a rough rounding of Shashikumar's calculation of<br>
projected mean daily and annual operating costs over the next 5 years for such<br>
vessels in terms of capital and operating expenses:<br>
<p>
	VLCC:	$46,000 - $16.8MM<br>
	MM Bbl:	$34,000 - $12.4MM<br>
	Aframax:	$24,000 - $8.8MM<br>
	PC		$21,000 - $7.7MM<br>
<p>
A couple of things pop out of Shashikumar's numbers.  First, these boats are<br>
EXPENSIVE.  Second, there are some serious diseconomies in building them these<br>
days, despite the figures he presents showing the very healthy state of demand<br>
for them.  Accordingly, the glut of tonnage most writers seem to be<br>
remembering when they say "Let's get one of those surplus tankers for our<br>
start-up enclave" is a thing of the past.<br>
<p>
Without looking for numbers from an equally well-researched and analyzed paper<br>
as Shashikumar's, I can relate that the market for non-vessel platforms is<br>
equally bad for the would-be utopian.  Mobile rig demand relative to supply is<br>
at an all time peak right now: About six months ago I attended a seminar where<br>
figures were presented showing that essentially the entirety of the world<br>
fleet of so-called jack-up rigs was booked up for the foreseeable future.<br>
<p>
Fixed platforms present a different picture.  Those currently working do so<br>
because they are still paying out for their present owners and are therefore<br>
not available at prices that don't reflect the underlying economics of<br>
hydrocarbon production.  Thus any would-be utopian must compete with the likes<br>
of Shell and Exxon for purchase of a working platform.  Abandoned platforms<br>
are a different story.  Unfortunately the world's coastal states are all<br>
following the lead of the U.S., requiring owners of platforms to remove them<br>
at the end of their useful lives.  Such structures are either cut free and<br>
floated to scrappers or are reduced to artificial reef status by the use of<br>
some pretty spectacular explosives engineering.<br>
<p>
The real world of maritime and energy markets therefore points to the<br>
possibility of rescuing an abandoned platform from the scrappers or the fishes<br>
as the only remotely realistic alternative.  Such structures are usually not<br>
that large, although they are STOUT and could conceivably support more of a<br>
superstructure than they already do, if clever engineering were brought to<br>
bear, and could also serve as a base for further expansion.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, all such structures of which I am aware are within the 200-mile<br>
"Exclusive Economic Zone" ("EEZ") defined by UNCLOS, the United Nations<br>
Convention on the Law of the Sea.  Under UNCLOS, the coastal state has the<br>
exclusive right to regulate the economic resources of the EEZ and fixed<br>
platforms situated in the EEZ become, for all practical legal purposes,<br>
territorial islands of the coastal state.  Accordingly, one searching for an<br>
escape from the legal regimes of current nation states won't do so on existing<br>
fixed ocean platforms.<br>
<p>
A couple of years ago Tom Morrow cryptically wrote to me that he had searched<br>
maps of the world's oceans and had located at least one promising geographic<br>
area of relatively shallow water outside the EEZ of any existing state.  I've<br>
not tried to reproduce this discovery but, if a terrestrial physical base<br>
beyond the reach of national sovereignty will be important in transhumanity's<br>
future, this "last free place on earth" could be very important.  As far as I<br>
know, this "lost horizon" does not lie above any known hydrocarbon deposit, so<br>
the oil companies won't be building structures there that, once abandoned,<br>
might form the seed for an ocean enclave. Extra-national colonists will<br>
therefore have to foot the bill themselves for building anything on such<br>
submerged territory.<br>
