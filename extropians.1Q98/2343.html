The reflecting plane is not flat, most photons do not get reflected but<br>
absorbed (xRay mirror they are not), causing the surface material to turn<br>
into a gas cloud exploding outwards. By the bulk, the counteractio is<br>
pressure from hot, dense gas acting onto the surface, not from the photon<br>
rebound. (Which is, btw, the chief problem of a nuke-driven solar sail:<br>
you'd need a gas cloud to attenuate the xrays into the VIS scale where the<br>
solar sail can act as a reflector). Surface turned into gas expands into<br>
vacuum, relaxating by EM radiation into the environment, which, if not<br>
sol-proximal, is few-K (Big Bang echo) cold space. <br>

My point is that we are not so very close to ground zero.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; you'll feel a hell of a bang even in a vacuum.</i><br>
<p>
See the escaping steel spheres.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Moreover the effect is brief, the nuke fireball in  space cooling         </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Granted, but when you're talking about pressures comparable to those at the </i><br>
<i>&gt; center of the sun it wouldn't take long to shatter a target.</i><br>
<p>
We are not riding the nuke, other relaxation pathways are not accounted<br>
for -- and I'd like to see some numbers. <br>
                <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Also, assuming wide habitat separation, on the average that means a         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;few km between me and ground zero.</i><br>
<i>&gt;               </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ok, if it's a few kilometers away then there are things you could do to  </i><br>
<i>&gt; protect yourself from a small H bomb, but even today ICBM's can achieve  </i><br>
<i>&gt; better accuracy that that.</i><br>
<p>
Is 100 MT small enough? The difficulties we are talking about is hitting a<br>
flurry of habitats/mosaic of subterranous settlings semisimultaneously,<br>
requring a large number of brilliant warheads. And fissible material yield<br>
should not scale very well in sub-kT range. Which does not mean it cannot<br>
be done, of course. The more I think of it, the less I like it. Sneaky,<br>
football-sized nukes.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Modern high-performance nukes, being high-tuned devices, do not age         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;gracefully. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True, that's mainly because of the tritium, H bombs don't need a lot of it </i><br>
<i>&gt; but they do need some and it's very expensive and has a half life of only </i><br>
<i>&gt; 10 years.</i><br>
<p>
A modern thermonuclear nuke would probably want to minimize the fissible<br>
content, which would require high compression ratios and peachy-clean<br>
isotopic compositon. Also, I think high explosives won't like prolonged<br>
curing under high-rad conditions. Apart from that, the lithium<br>
deuteride/tritide pellet homogenity should also suffer from transmutation.<br>

<p>
Maybe that's why they took polymer foam instead of polymer solid, and<br>
adjusted the geometry accordingly to compensate for that. There's a reason<br>
thermonuclear devices are so difficult to build. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; It's clear that foam is important in an H bomb but probably not for the reason </i><br>

Interesting thread. I'd like to see some design bluepauses, but I guess<br>
that's still decades off.<br>
