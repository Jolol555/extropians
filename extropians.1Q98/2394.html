Max More wrote 3/3/98: &lt;I should know better than to get involved in an<br>
abortion discussion. However, I find you and I are usually in agreement<br>
philosophically, so I'm curious to discover why we diverge so clearly<br>
here.&gt;<br>
<p>
I, too, should know better.  These discussions invariably boil down to<br>
taking an obstinate stand on definitions, and I've rarely seen anyone truly<br>
rationally consider the issue at a deeper level than convenience on the<br>
pro-death side and religious dogma on the anti-death side. I know we don't<br>
diverge on the polycentric approach to the issue, the best argument will<br>
come from tracing the evolutionary consequences within many different<br>
jurisdictions, each approaching the question as seems best.<br>
<p>
&lt;I don't know any defender of the legality of abortion who views fetuses as<br>
"the enemy".&gt;<br>
<p>
Open your eyes.  I mean this sincerely, with no disrespect.<br>
<p>
&lt;Personally, I do regard abortions as nasty things, to be avoided as much<br>
as<br>
possible.&gt;<br>
<p>
I know that.  You are not like President Clinton who says the identical<br>
thing just before he vetoes the partial birth abortion ban, a hideous form<br>
of infanticide that morally soils the whole country.<br>
<p>
&lt;And, even more certainly, women who have been raped should not have to see<br>
through a pregnancy. I assume you disagree, even in such a case. Is that<br>
correct?&gt;<br>
<p>
No, I'm reasonable, it's non-consensual for the woman and illicitly rewards<br>
the rapist within the gene pool.  I don't think that jurisdictions who<br>
allow this will slip into the culture of death.  A child forced on a woman<br>
is tragic and so is that child's legalized murder.  However, I see no good<br>
reason why jurisdictions shouldn't be able to disallow this, if that is<br>
what they think is best for their society.<br>
<p>
&lt;Let's keep this on a less emotive level. Otherwise the other side will<br>
start painting you with the anti-woman brush.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes, boss.  &lt;g&gt;  As you know, I don't mind being painted with any brush, if<br>
it's true I'm happy to have it stick, that's how I learn, if it's false it<br>
will flake off with no harm done.  I don't mind being painted with the<br>
anti-woman-who-murders-her-unborn-child brush at all.<br>
<p>
&lt;A fetus is fully human in a genetic sense from fertilization.  But why is<br>
this relevant? What does genetic humanity have to do with moral standing or<br>
the granting of rights?&gt;<br>
<p>
The key is in the concept of development.  Development of the self,<br>
self-ownership, means others should stay hands off.  But development of<br>
other selves, that is, non-consensual development, is ownership of other<br>
selves.  Other selves have every right to question this activity and to<br>
bring the activity into the political sphere.  The concepts of guardianship<br>
and power of attorney evolved in society to champion the rights of<br>
developing selves that are incapable of acting as their own champions.<br>
<p>
&lt;Beings of at least human personality who are not genetically human<br>
(possible ETs, genetically altered descendants of humanity, and -- you may<br>
not grant this -- future AIs) could have as strong a moral standing as you<br>
or I.&gt;<br>
<p>
And just who would be granting said moral standing to such entities?  I<br>
would grant future AIs with a majority of analog components, I just won't<br>
grant that anything purely digital could ever be conscious, consciousness<br>
must access the entire universe, not just 50% of it.<br>
<p>
&lt;In this case, you are doing damage to the person who will exist. In the<br>
case of abortion, you are preventing a person from coming into existence.&gt;<br>
<p>
As I said above, these discussions rapidly get to an obstinate stand on<br>
definitions.  "Preventing a person from coming into existence" is a<br>
definitional stance unconnected with reality.  The reality is the person in<br>
question has been in existence since conception and that what you call<br>
"prevention" is actually murder.  This is the same difficulty that the<br>
abolitionists had with defeating slavery, the Constitition said slaves were<br>
only counted as 3/5 of a person, less than fully human.  It was solely and<br>
entirely a definitional tug-of-war, exactly as abortion is.  We diverge<br>
here definitionally, it's the same old problem of "whose rationality?"<br>
<p>
&lt;I would choose a polycentric system in which genetic engineering of slaves<br>
was not allowed.  But that's not because I believe such alterations violate<br>
the right of the fetus.&gt;<br>
<p>
I know that deep down, we do not diverge in our reverence for life<br>
ascending, nor do we diverge in seeing that the polycentric approach - the<br>
liquid realm - is where ascension has the strongest chance of success.<br>
<p>
&lt;I don't believe that rights are entities that exist in themselves. They<br>
are simply principles that we agree on that regulate the use of force. We<br>
*could* grant fetuses full rights, but why should we? Why should we grant<br>
them full rights any more than we should grant such rights to birds, bees,<br>
or beetles?&gt;<br>
<p>
Different jurisdictions should be allowed to answer these considerations in<br>
their own way.  The proof of which way is best would then be found in the<br>
pudding.  My line of moral reasoning is permissible only when definitions<br>
at the foundation of the issue are agreed on.  Short of agreement on this,<br>
we inhabit separate worlds and cannot grant legitimacy to each other, let<br>
alone understand one another.<br>
<p>
&lt;BTW, I find it implausible grant full rights even to a newborn baby. They<br>
are no more a person than is a seven-month old fetus (though either of<br>
these are much closer to being a person than is a month-old fetus). <br>
Nevertheless, I grant the view that it should be illegal to kill such<br>
babies now that they are biologically separate -- but the source of that<br>
rule does not have to be a right of the baby.&gt;<br>
<p>
Welcome to the slippery slope, you have made a case for infanticide here. <br>
In fact, with this line of reasoning, you can't draw a line anywhere for<br>
any inconvenient entity to be bumped off at any time.  Why not the old and<br>
decrepit, or the handicapped, or anti-government types or anyone?  When you<br>
speak of the "source of the rule" all I see is the very oldest rule of all,<br>
"might makes right."  Nature is red in tooth and claw.  If it is legitimate<br>
for the strong to prey upon the weak, sooner or later, we will end up, not<br>
as a society, but as isolated systems of perfected self-defense staring at<br>
each other across no-man's land.<br>
<p>
&lt;But a fetus is not yet a person.&gt;<br>
<p>
Purely by definition, and mostly, but not entirely, for convenience's sake.<br>
 A slave was not a full person at the time we kicked those tyrannical Brits<br>
back across the Atlantic, either.  Yet, solely by definition, they<br>
eventually became a person.  Do you see the parallel?<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;A fertilized egg with a normal full set of chromosomes is the starting<br>
point for human development, not earlier.&gt;<br>
<p>
MM: &lt;True, but it's not the beginning of development of personhood, and<br>
it's<br>
personhood to which rights should attach, not genetic humanity.&gt;<br>
<p>
Again, "personhood" is definitional, this may accord with convenience, but<br>
not reality.  Different definitions should be allowed to work out their<br>
societal consequences in different jurisdictions.<br>
<p>
&lt;Reilly, it's not a fair tactic to call advocates of abortion rights death<br>
worshippers. That's just obviously false, and will only mean those who<br>
disagree won't take your views seriously.&gt;<br>
<p>
On definitional issues, it's not a question of being taken seriously, it's<br>
a question of rectitude, of drawing lines.  Those who define away human<br>
life naturally cannot begin to understand those who do not.  They are<br>
literally incomprehensible to one another.  Most individuals do not take<br>
the incomprehensible seriously, and those who do make their axons sprout<br>
like the green of springtime.<br>
<p>
&lt;Life is not only about survival. A developed person's right to life must<br>
include the right to remove interferences with that life when that<br>
interference results from something that is not a person.&gt;<br>
<p>
I fully agree that man does not live by bread alone.  I think this accords<br>
with my earlier point that developing your own self should be free from<br>
interference.  However, I cannot see where, in the course of an<br>
individual's life, he becomes "developed."  Developed is a static concept<br>
that I have never observed in living entities.  Life is always<br>
"developing," from conception to death.  Even with indefinite longevity, no<br>
one will ever be "developed," they will indefinitely be "developing."  If I<br>
change your sentence to read, "A developing person's right to life must<br>
include the right to remove interferences with that life when that<br>
interference results from something that is not a person," the flavor of<br>
the argument shifts to protections for the unborn child.  If I tack on to<br>
that sentence "and the responsibility to submit to legitimate political<br>
authority in cases where that interference results from another developing<br>
person," then I think we have arrived at something close to my position.<br>
<p>
&lt;BTW, according to my mother, I was a mistake my parents made when she was<br>
35 (quite old for a pregnancy in the '60s). They didn't abort my precursor,<br>
and I'm glad. But I'd hate to think that, if they had, someone would come<br>
and drag my mother to jail for protecting her own life and purposes by<br>
removed a small lump of biological matter than didn't have a personality<br>
and didn't think and didn't have goals and projects.&gt;<br>
<p>
I shy away from testimonials, but I was a surprise (she didn't call it a<br>
"mistake," I think "surprise" is much more dynamically optimistic) when my<br>
mother was 35.  Rather than say "they didn't abort my precursor," the<br>
reality is that "they didn't abort me."  That reality cannot be wiped away<br>
definitionally.  *You* were not murdered, not "a small lump of biological<br>
matter than didn't have a personality and didn't think and didn't have<br>
goals and projects," but *you*.  And for what it's worth, I too am glad<br>
your mother didn't murder you.  As far as I can tell, our divergence is<br>
definitional in nature, but I can't see that we diverge substantially in<br>
our sentiments on the issue nor in our preferred polycentric approach to<br>
it.  I am simply taking the abolitionist's side, and you are taking the<br>
other side.<br>
