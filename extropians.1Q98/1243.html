<p>
Thus spake under the greatest rhetorical error/intentional fraud the liberal<br>
nuts can muster: that animals are sentient. If something cannot come up to me<br>
and discuss the weather, its not sentient. My dog may have some degree of<br>
minimal intelligence, and in my opinion may exist in a grey area that I am<br>
willing to grant, which is why I don't eat dog (but then again, there are some<br>
humans I've met who are dumber than a side of beef). Since your typical vegan<br>
is also an atheist, or at best, a rational non-dietical buddhist, they cannot<br>
claim the protections of the Natural Law doctrine, so they must then agree<br>
that rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness only applies to<br>
individuals who are willing to use force, or employ others to use force, to<br>
attain and protect those rights for themselves, i.e. the Force Doctrine. Given<br>
this, and that humans have demonstrated themselves to be the premier predator<br>
on the planet, any herbivore which cannot or does not defend its own rights to<br>
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, therefore has no rights,<br>
intelligent or no. Again an animal like a dog, which when domesticated<br>
considers itself a member of a human pack, is fully capable of defending<br>
itself when it sees a threat. That it doens't often win against a human is<br>
another issue entirely.<br>
<p>
Cows have been bred for slaughter for thousands of years. If they were<br>
sentient in any way, shape or form, they would either a) be making some sort<br>
of group effort to communicate their wishes to not be et, or b) have developed<br>
a culture/religion that has resigned them to accepting their place in the<br>
cosmos, or c) attempt to defend their rights in some way shape or form, at<br>
least on a frequent enough basis to be noticable by the general populace.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; The whole "diet for a small planet" mantra reminds me of Karl Marx</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; was everything because the transportation and distribution system was</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The whole carnivorist mantra reminds me of nothing so much as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; transparent rationalizations for self-destructive and morally</i><br>
<i>&gt; indifferent behavior one finds tripping from the mouths of any substance</i><br>

The whole vegan mantra reminds me of nothing so much as the transparent<br>
rationalizations of self-involved, self-deluded and morally self-righteous<br>
behavior one finds tripping from the mouths of any religious or political<br>
fanatic, i.e. don't confuse me with the facts, my mind is made up. And the<br>
same judgements apply, as far as I'm concerned. Should be illegal, morally<br>
shunned, and laughed at as stupid.<br>
<p>
If the human race becomes all herbivores, what species will then claim the job<br>
of top carnivore???<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; p.s. skip the veggie flames please.  I eat very little meat and have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; almost completely given it up for health reasons, but spent most of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; my childhood on a farm I know that the only reason cattle, sheep, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; most livestock exist in the world today are because we keep them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alive.  If it were not to become burgers and steaks then cows would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have long since become another evolutionary dead-end (you cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; quite appreciate just how dumb these animals have been bred until you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; watch sheep trying to get out of the rain by hiding under the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sheep.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; PS: Sorry for the veggie flame-broiling.  I daresay a meat-cow would just</i><br>
<i>&gt; as soon become a literal evolutionary dead-end then experience the</i><br>
<i>&gt; privilege of prolonged abuse and subsequent consumption.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I dunno. Given the possibilities for the singularity, I would daresay that a<br>
large percentage of the human race will soom become a literal evolutionary<br>
dead end. WOuld they prefer a quick end, or to live on as the pawns and<br>
playthings of greater beings? I know what I think, but what about billy ray<br>
and sally mae welfare check? Seems to me that the greater mass of humanity is<br>
really only concerned with living by any means possible rather than standing<br>
and possibly dying, on principle.<br>
