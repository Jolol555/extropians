<i>&gt; extropians. Perhaps, in light of studies (which may</i><br>

<i>&gt; good for a person's health and longevity, the person</i><br>
<i>&gt; merely chose to carry the God meme for his/her own</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropian benefit, although some might consider this</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite a mental juggling act. How is it spelled,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Deism"?)</i><br>
<p>
I suggest that there are some variants on a belief in God which are<br>
consistent with Extropian thought.  In fact, some thinkers who are quite<br>
Extropian in many ways would suggest that it is almost certain that God<br>
(or someone like him) exists.  I am referring to the belief that the<br>
universe we live in is engineered or constructed, and possibly maintained,<br>
by intelligent beings.<br>
<p>
Hans Moravec and Frank Tipler have both proposed that in the future we<br>
will be able to create computer simulations of this and other universes,<br>
and that it will be quite natural to do so.  In particular we may choose<br>
to simulate past times of our own universe in different variations.<br>
If this is done enough times (and Tipler believes that it will be done<br>
an infinite number of times) then you could argue that the odds are<br>
overwhelming that "this instance" of our lives (if that phrase means<br>
anything!) is actually part of one of these simulations rather than the<br>
original real-space run-through.<br>
<p>
In addition there is the prospect of creating basement universes,<br>
entirely new Big Bangs where we might even have control over some of<br>
the laws of nature, and where we could eventually design those laws to<br>
favor the formation of new living and intelligent beings.  Conceivably we<br>
could even encode our own minds into those laws so that we can guide or<br>
control events in certain ways.<br>
<p>
The existence of these kinds of gods may not be completely untestable,<br>
although without knowing their motivations it is hard to know what we<br>
might do to discover their existence.  Moravec describes a scenario where<br>
a sufficiently advanced life form in a simulation is able to deduce the<br>
facts about its situation, but the prospect seemed a bit far-fetched.<br>
Tipler proposes that the gods will extract people from the simulation at<br>
the moment of their death, at least some of the time.  Presumably there<br>
would be nothing to stop someone running a simulation from intervening<br>
to produce miracles or even answer prayers, if they chose.  But evidently<br>
this behavior is not common in our universe.<br>
<p>
In the context of Extropian philosophy, there are two aspects to believing<br>
in this kind of God.  On the negative side, it could induce passivity, as<br>
people hope with Tipler that a merciful God will resurrect them into a<br>
marvelous new world upon their death.  On the positive side, it holds out<br>
the prospect that we could become Gods of our own universes.<br>
<p>
People often complain about God's management of the universe, with the<br>
existence of evil and suffering often being suggested as signs of God's<br>
nonexistence or even his evil nature.  But it may be that in as little<br>
as a few decades we will have the ability to create conscious simulated<br>
entities within computers, which we can rule absolutely.  This will be<br>
an awesome power, with heavy responsibilities.  Will we do better than<br>
the universe we see around us?  Should we insure that our creatures live<br>
lifes of ease and comfort, with never an unpleasant moment?  Or may it<br>
turn out that we must subject them to difficulties and give them freedom<br>
to behave badly in order to produce the most fulfilling lives?  In a few<br>
years we may not find it so easy to criticize God for his mismanagement.<br>
