<i>&gt; From: John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;&gt;I can't prove I wasn't at the scene of most murders, neither can you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;den Otter" &lt;otter@globalxs.nl&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;You can if you document your life (mini audio/video) and/or others, </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;like the government are doing it for you. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I concede that if you let me provide the video tape I can give you iron clad </i><br>
<i>&gt; proof that I was not at the crime scene, even if I was.</i><br>
<p>
It's not that easy to fool the system. First of all, you aren't the only one who's<br>
recording. Actually, there's a great chance that due to the fact that there are<br>
street surveillance cams, satellite cams, other people with bodycams etc,<br>
you will be recorded (possibly by multiple, independent sources you know<br>
nothing about) at a time and place that somehow contradicts your story, or<br>
otherwise makes the investigators doubt your innocence (of course, it can<br>
work in your advantage too, if you're really innocent). For example, if you<br>
kill someone with a bomb you have to buy the ingredients first. Forensics<br>
can determine with great precision what was in the bomb and where it<br>
could have come from. Even if you remove all other (obvious, like reciepts)<br>
evidence that you were in store x last week that sells steel pipes as used in <br>
the murder, the storecam and streetcams tell a different story. Piece by<br>
piece your "perfect" cover story comes apart, until there's nothing left.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, personal cam systems would have to meet certain standards<br>
in order to be accepted as strong evidence. They would be made so that they <br>
transmit their location and images 24h a day to a central database, where they <br>
are dated and stored in multiple redundancy. They'd also have an internal <br>
memory that could be downloaded to the central databases via the net every <br>
day or so (incidentally, this system of leading a documented yet private life <br>
could help with reconstruction of one's personality/memory after an accident. <br>
It's a primitive forerunner of making copies of an upload. Cams must also be <br>
tamper-proof, with alarms going off when someone tries to meddle with its <br>
innards etc. Of course, *nothing* is 100% fool proof, but (once again) if it <br>
helps to _improve_ the situation by helping to catch all but the most cunning <br>
criminals it has been worth the effort, IMHO. Since most criminals are in<br>
fact quite dumb, you might reduce crime with as much as 90+% with<br>
omnipresent surveillance and a rational, no-nonsense justice systems that<br>
will keep the bad guys off the streets for good.<br>
<p>
 			<br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;Really tough cases could be left to (teams of) human judges ('till </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;the advent of AI), </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An AI may have other concerns, do you care if snails live together in justice?</i><br>
<p>
That depends on how you program it. Only a fool would make a machine with<br>
superior intellect *and* a free will. I agree that when "independant" AI, or AI-<br>
human hybrids (uploads) come to the scene they won't think too much of<br>
humans (but enough to exterminate them 'cause, after all, it was humans that<br>
made them, which means that basically any human can become a Power and<br>
threaten their position).<br>
<p>
Anyway, a justice system that is as automated as is technologically possible <br>
would be a great improvement over any system we have today. The purpose<br>
of "electronic justice" is:<br>
--reducing the judge to what he should always have been: an executive of the law.<br>
A judge must determine guilty/not guitly/not enough conclusive evidence and<br>
then (if the verdict is "guilty" look up the punishment that the law prescribes in <br>
this particular case. No more, no less.<br>
--making sure that the *same judge*, or group of judges handles every case.<br>
Right now, it is openly known and more or less accepted that judges have<br>
all different philosophies etc, and that you are lucky when you get judge X<br>
because he gives mild punishments, or have bad luck 'cause you get judge<br>
Y and he's known as a hardass. The difference could be 20 years or more<br>
in some cases (for the same crime). Also, judges tend to be extremely harsh<br>
on people who "take justice into their own hands". This is not the way it<br>
should be; the characteristics of a _fair_ justice system are equal treatment<br>
of all equal cases (law refined with binding precedent), that the punishment<br>
fits the crime (eye for an eye) and that only truly harmful actions are punished.<br>
<p>
Today's justice systems, be it the anglo-american or continental or whatever <br>
don't meet the criteria of fair justice. I have made some suggestions to<br>
improve this. If you don't agree, I'd love to hear your alternative design<br>
(or do you think that all is well as it is?) <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;Judges would be required to take "common sense" tests as part of </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;their training.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that's a fine idea, provided of course I decide what is common sense </i><br>
<i>&gt; and give the test.</i><br>
<p>
I would gladly set up such a test, since I'm obviously well-endowed when it <br>
comes to "common sense" ;-). Actually, it might not be as hard as you think<br>
to reach a consensus on common sense and justice, since even we only<br>
disagree on one crime (slander). In fact, I think few could/would object to<br>
the notion that only truly harmful acts (murder, rape, theft, damage to persons<br>
or property etc.) should be punished. That's common sense. Other expressions<br>
of common sense are for example the transhumanist principles. A test could<br>
partially be based on that.<br>
<p>
To train judges (and later computers -- how about a justice Deep Blue) you<br>
would have case simulations of real and fictional crimes. The judicial candidates<br>
with the best results (after a minimal number of training hours) would qualify<br>
for judge (of course continous background checks, mental stability,<br>
a documented life etc. are also necessary requirements). In effect, the judges <br>
would function as judicial AI's, with the whole of the systems judicial data at<br>
their fingertips. Just hit the button to get all the info on any suspect you want.<br>
It goes without saying that the judges would be among the heaviest monitored<br>
people in the empire.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;the crimes that threaten society most like street violence will be </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;hit the hardest by increased surveillance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Street violence doesn't threaten society, and the individuals it does </i><br>
<i>&gt; threatens are rare. </i><br>
<p>
E-x-c-u-s-e me!? There is a *huge* chance that any given person will become<br>
the victim of some form of street violence in their lifitime. For example, every<br>
one in four women in the US will be raped if my memory serves me well.<br>
You will almost certainly be robbed, beaten or worse at some point. That's<br>
why people rather not go out at night nowadays, especially old people and<br>
women etc. If there's anything that bothers people *directly* it's streetcrime.<br>
Omnipresent surveillance and a swift and sure justice system would wipe<br>
the thugs from the streets, and prevent burglaries, shoplifting and the likes<br>
too. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the USA violent crime has declined for 6 years in a </i><br>
<i>&gt; row, that's why your idea of turning the entire world into one big </i><br>
<i>&gt; concentration camp in order to solve a trivial problem makes no sense. </i><br>
<p>
I think "concentration camp" is a little off the mark in this context. Remember:<br>
as long as you stick to (the now quite comprehensive and fair) law you<br>
won't even notice that you're being monitored. You just notice that since<br>
the new laws have come into effect your house hasn't been broken into, <br>
your wallet wasn't stolen when you left it on the restaurant table, the youths <br>
that used to threaten passers-by in the mall are now quite well-behaved etc. <br>
It's not about solving "trivial problems", but about decimating all crime and <br>
making society a safer place to live in, so that you can focus on the things <br>
that count.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes I could be killed by some mugger on the street, but history has shown I'm </i><br>
<i>&gt; far more likely to die because a government says I've slandered it, or </i><br>
<i>&gt; because it forces me to fight in some idiotic war, or because it thinks it's </i><br>
<i>&gt; smarter than the market, impoverishes my society and causes me to starve.  </i><br>
<p>
Why do you assume that the completely rational modifications to<br>
the justice system would _automatically_ lead to some kind of Stalinist<br>
revival? Dictators have no interest in justice. The proposed changes are<br>
largely independant of other politics; any democracy could adopt the<br>
surveillance system (hell, they're doing it right now) and the kind of<br>
semi-automated, consequent and proportional law as described earlier.<br>
 	     <br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;Miss Marple-esque murder mysteries aren't exactly the rule, you know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True, because most real murder mysteries are never solved. </i><br>
<p>
Largely because we don't have the Ubiquitous Surveillance System <br>
(or "Ubiquity" for short) yet. Apart from that, most crimes are anything <br>
but cunning and mysterious. If the new system can reduce crime to<br>
a couple of odd murders by either extremely stupid (they don't last long)<br>
or extremely wily folks a year we all should be quite pleased. Furthermore:<br>
because of the low crime rates the police can throw their full weight at<br>
the few remaining crimes which makes it harder still to get away with it.<br>
Survival of the fittest, you know. The remaining criminals are probably<br>
*less* dangerous, because extreme caution and self-discipline are needed<br>
to fool all parts of the system. The truly dangerous criminals that kill on<br>
impulse without too much considering the consequences will be the first<br>
to say "hello" to the executioner. Good riddens. <br>
 	     <br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;Cases like O.J. Simpson, where an obvious murderer can never be </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;brought to justice because the judicial system fucked up the first </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;time around must be prevented however. This means that even if </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;someone has initially been found innocent, he *can* be tried for the </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;same crime at a later date if new evidence comes up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a good example, the judicial system did fuck up but unfortunately </i><br>
<i>&gt; there's nothing unusual there. A mountain of evidence was presented at the </i><br>
<i>&gt; trial, more than enough to convict I think, evidently you agree, but others </i><br>
<i>&gt; disagree including the jury and significant new evidence has not turned up. </i><br>
<i>&gt; So what do we do, keep retrying a person till we get a verdict we like? </i><br>
<i>&gt; If I'm convicted and I don't like it can I keep getting new trials until </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm  found innocent?</i><br>
<p>
First of all: keep the press out of the courtroom, in fact out of justice<br>
alltogether.<br>
This is in everyone's interest, and prevents a "trial by (manipulated) public<br>
opinion".<br>
Furthermore: elliminate juries, they are neither fit nor motivated to make a sound<br>
judgement. Just as you don't select just any passenger to fly a plane, you don't<br>
select just any bunch of people to decide over matters of (sometimes) life and death<br>
<p>
in court. That should be done by detached, experienced professionals, i.e. computers<br>
and a professional team of judges. All fully monitored and with reliable track<br>
records<br>
and many hours of training with the case simulation computer.<br>
<p>
With all of this (AND the Ubiquity), the chances are slim that the system makes a <br>
serious error the first time around. Just for that freak case where the verdict is<br>
screwed up time and again you could set a limit of, say, three trials (much shorter<br>
than today's trials and considerably less intrusive to the suspect -- he can remain<br>
under monitored house arrest while his case is reviewed). After three subsequent<br>
judicial fuckups in the same case you walk unconditionally. In my system, O.J.<br>
would no longer be with us -- guaranteed.<br>
 	     <br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;the torture that is applied to especially cruel/multiple murderers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;which they duly deserve.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Duly deserve? Again we find a major disagreement on the nature of Justice. </i><br>
<i>&gt; My definition, Justice is the course of action that reduces the amount of </i><br>
<i>&gt; suffering in the world the most.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Your definition, Justice is the course of action that rewards victims by </i><br>
<i>&gt; entertaining them with the suffering of people they don't like.</i><br>
<p>
My definition is actually:<br>
<p>
"Justice is punishing harmful acts in proportion to the crime and in a consequent<br>
manner."<br>
<p>
It's not about entertaining anyone, although I wouldn't object to it if the<br>
(relatives of)<br>
the victims would feel better if they watched the criminal suffer. Justice is about<br>
having a solid, consequent measurement when punishing harmful acts. "Eye for<br>
an eye" is _the most logical_ and _consequent_ measurement there is. It has an<br>
almost mathematical logic and beauty to it. Action and reaction are in perfect<br>
balance. Other measurements just appear arbitrary, based on no specific logic<br>
or wisdom.<br>
<p>
And there's a purely practical side to an eye for an eye, apart from being the <br>
most consequent measurement, namely that you get no murders "for free" like<br>
today. It doesn't really matter how many people you kill or how you kill them<br>
if there's only one standard ("humane") form of capital punishment or life<br>
imprisonment. In the new system, it does matter. The more you kill &amp; torture,<br>
the longer and more severely you will suffer. That may a certain preventive<br>
function.<br>
 	 <br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;&gt;Do you really find it hard to understand why anybody and everybody </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;&gt;would be more than nervous when police bring them in?</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	 </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;That depends on the public's trust in the system, the PR of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;police etc. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Good PR needs a jingle, how about "A day without torture is like a day </i><br>
<i>&gt; without sunshine". Then we could have a sitcom about the wacky adventures of </i><br>
<i>&gt; Tommy the Torturer, like the time his boss told him to draw and quarter a </i><br>
<i>&gt; prisoner but by mistake he burned him at the stake instead. A laugh riot! </i><br>
<i>&gt; Fun for the whole family! Then we need a kid show about your friendly </i><br>
<i>&gt; neighborhood torturer, perhaps we could interest the Disney people, or the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Muppets.</i><br>
<p>
Quite funny actually :-) , but I'm affraid the image of the police would mostly<br>
be determined by their track record (open to the public) and word of mouth. <br>
A good system needs no slick advertizing.<br>
 	 <br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;people won't be too scared when politely asked to come to down to </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;the station.  [...]  At the stage that someone is requested to </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;appear at a hearing it must already be 99% (so to speak) sure that </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;he's guilty.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's see, when the police politely ask me to come down to the station I know  </i><br>
<i>&gt; that there is a 99% chance that they think I'm guilty and duly deserve to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; slowly tortured to death but there is no reason I should be nervous. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Could you run that past me again?  </i><br>
<p>
Certainly, this means that very few people would be unduly picked up by the<br>
police in the first place, because a very solid case is required to allow this.<br>
Fear is largely determined by the image the police and justice system has. <br>
Maybe people fear cops where you live, but certainly not where I come from <br>
or would like to live. Believe it or not, firm justice and a "friendly" police force<br>
*do* mix. In fact, the police officers would be a lot *less* frustrated than they<br>
are now, and because less would be needed the mental requirements could<br>
be higher and training better. In a system with extensive surveillance you<br>
can be close to certain that there is some recording that proves your innocence,<br>
if you indeed didn't commit the crime. Almost anything can be retraced, and<br>
if there is no hard evidence of your guilt you won't be convicted. Unlike in <br>
Saddam country or the US you wouldn't have to fear for your life &amp; limb when <br>
arrested for a crime you didn't commit.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;The damage has been done by then, and is often irreversible. You </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;might take the slanderer down with you, but that won't undo the </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;damage to your reputation. It's better to prevent it alltogether, by </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	&gt;law.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	  </i><br>
<i>&gt; If me taking the slanderer down with my words does not deter him why will the </i><br>
<i>&gt; law do better? </i><br>
<p>
Because the law has means to investigate and expose someone. Instead of going<br>
at it alone, you have a large "gang" of top crime specialists and their enforcers<br>
to help you. This is especially useful if you've been singled out by someone<br>
who's (a lot) more powerful than yourself, like a cult or a company etc. That's<br>
what justice is all about: there are specialists for judicial matters so that<br>
the people can focus on other things. That's society's advantage over anarchy.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Fortunately the Internet and Cryptography are making this debate moot,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; slander laws are becoming impossible to enforce. If I want to slander you I </i><br>
<i>&gt; can do so anonymously and you can slander me back the same way. I don't think </i><br>
<i>&gt; that will bring an end to civilization and because I'm not thin skinned I </i><br>
<i>&gt; don't think it will bring the end to me either. You'll probably survive to.</i><br>
<p>
That's true, the net has comlicated matters considerably. Still, many electronic<br>
nastyness can be traced and there are plenty of other slander forms (oral, written)<br>
that are easier to target. By the way, with slander I don't mean the low key<br>
angry neigbor stuff, or flame wars over the net, but maliciously trying to destroy<br>
someone's reputation for personal gain. This kind of slander can lead to<br>
real damage like the loss of your job or worse, and not just a bruised ego.<br>
It falls in approximately the same category as staking and should be dealt<br>
with accordingly.<br>
