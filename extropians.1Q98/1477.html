Clarke lives with a lifelong friend of his and that friend's family in Sri<br>
Lanka.  The family benefits Clarke because he has a family-atmosphere (Clarke<br>
is divorced and has no children) and they provide assistance to him since his<br>
health is somewhat frail.  Clarke also operates a business (scuba diving I<br>
believe) in the region where he lives.  Clarke stated in a special on the<br>
Sci-Fi Channel a few weeks ago that he likes the weather and the people of Sri<br>
Lanka and that is why he lives there.<br>
<p>
As for reports about Clarke's sexual life, I think the only thing worse than<br>
speculative tabloid-like reports is the proliferation of such reports by<br>
others.  I think, given the current political witch-hunts masquerading as<br>
pursuits of justice and the tabloid atmosphere we have in America at the<br>
moment, I have had my fill this year of speculative rumors.<br>
