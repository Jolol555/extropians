John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt; reported:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Campbell and Murphy found a way to reset this clock with light, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; the astonishing thing is that the light need not be applied to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; eyes, anywhere on the skin will do, the back of the knee for</i><br>
<i>&gt; example. There must be a signal but how the brain knows that light</i><br>
<i>&gt; is being applied to the back of the knee is a mystery.</i><br>
<p>
	The report I heard on NPR didn't say the "signal" was a<br>
mystery.  It's via the blood.  Evidently the "himo" in the hemoglobin<br>
is molecularly very similar to light sensative stuff that makes plants<br>
green.  The "back of the knee" is good because there are lots of blood<br>
vessels close to the surface of the skin and light can be easily<br>
applied there such that the eyes aren't aware of it.  Light shined in<br>
the eyes also makes lots of contact with blood so this is why this<br>
sets this clock so well.<br>
<p>
	Interesting.<br>
