So essentially, these 'stumps' are less than a clone, but more than just<br>
a grown organ. Kind of a human worm, in that all it can do is eat,<br>
excrete, and reproduce (how is that different from now???). Put a mouth<br>
on top, strapped into a permanent outhouse, sterile but capable of<br>
supporting a pregnancy. Also, engineer some sort of cloaca in the belly<br>
for birthing the child without that passage through tight hips, or<br>
engineer the hips to be much bigger.<br>
