<p>
I'm sorry to hear that the US governement still has not outgrown<br>
distributing support on the basis of race, family-status,<br>
chemical-addictions or sexual orentation. This is a _US_ problem however,<br>
don't use this as an argument against governemental systems elsewhere that<br>
don't suffer from these faults.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Currently the government only does this if the state Governor asks the</i><br>
<i> &gt;President to declare a disaster area. If you are not in a declared area,</i><br>
<i> &gt;then the government system doesn't owe you anything, which stinks.</i><br>
<p>
More _US_ policy problems, not a general case. I suggest you get yourself a<br>
decent gov before you start bashing Europeans ones of which you apparently<br>
know very little.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;If you think that the government is responsible for protecting your</i><br>
<i> &gt;personal security, you are severely misinformed. Police are only there</i><br>
<i> &gt;to catch the bad guy AFTER he has robbed, raped or killed you, not to</i><br>
<i> &gt;prevent it from happening.</i><br>
<p>
No offence but I think I'm better informed about _Dutch_ law-enforcement<br>
policies than you are. Prevention of crime (and thus, effectively,<br>
protection of citizens) is just as important as 'catching the bad guys',<br>
and resources are allocated accordingly (IMHO a good thing, prevention is<br>
better for the would-be victims and more cost-effective).<br>
<p>
 (concerning the dike-enhancement plan)<br>
<i> &gt;I don't imagine that the Dutch Government was the contractor that did</i><br>
<i> &gt;the work, was it?</i><br>
<p>
Actually it was, some of the equipment was so expensive and specialized,<br>
custom designed for the project, that no company would consider investing<br>
in it (and by expensive I mean you you should think 'Apollo project'). Of<br>
course commercial contractors were also brought in but a governement<br>
ministery ran the whole thing.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Since most of your country is in a flood plain (partly</i><br>
<i> &gt;man-made), it is obvious that your country is essentially what is known</i><br>
<i> &gt;as a "planned community". </i><br>
<p>
I don't think the Netherlands was planned in any way when it became<br>
independant from Spain in the 17th century. A bunch of people simply filled<br>
a power-vacuum, and tried to establish some sort of democracy (emphasizing<br>
'some sort'). From there it just developed slowly to what it is now. If you<br>
mean by 'planned community' that there's a lot of complex legislature then<br>
you're right. We have to plan with 15M people living on a piece of land not<br>
250 by 350 Km's and still being the worlds #4 in agricultural exports.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Its a rather large one, granted, such that it</i><br>
<i> &gt;has attained sovereign status as an independent nation, but it, at its</i><br>
<i> &gt;heart, is a planned community, much like smaller 'gated communities' that</i><br>
<i> &gt;are springing up all over the US here.</i><br>
<p>
Based on my limited knowledge about American 'gated communities' this<br>
comparison is bogus and rather insulting too. The right to live in Holland<br>
is not determined by productivity, there's no price tag for acces. All<br>
citizens, no matter how unproductive, lazy or drug-addicted enjoy the<br>
security of a basic income and medical facilities and such. In Holland<br>
people are _free_ to _choose_ whether or not they want to become productive<br>
(that's freedom! ;-). I think this is precisely the opposite from what a<br>
gated community stands for.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Conversely, hardly anyone on earth has the ability to choose what country</i><br>
<i> &gt;to be a citizen of, and those who would prefer to not support the</i><br>
<i> &gt;unproductive elements of society have no developed nation to which to</i><br>
<i> &gt;emigrate to.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is interesting to see that there is a such a strong correlation to<br>
countries that try to prevent their citizens from starving (even the<br>
'unproductive' ones) and countries that we consider 'developed'.<br>
 <br>
What do you suggest we do with all the 'unproductive' people? Let them starve?<br>
You could be unproductive a few seconds from now, it only takes a broken<br>
bloodvessel in the brain to reduce a single, white, able-bodied male to a<br>
very crippled and very unproductive individual. I wish you a long and<br>
healthy life of course, but do not fool yourself into believing it could<br>
not happen to you. Then what? Do you have a big family that will take care<br>
of you (or do they refuse to support 'unproductive individuals')<br>
And what about the growing percentage of the population that is becoming<br>
redundant by automation? We do not need strong AI to automate a<br>
considerable part of the economy, the proces is happening right now.<br>
<p>
 And later:<br>
<i> &gt;I am using NH as an example of a state which is as close to a</i><br>
<i> &gt;libertarian optimum as one can currently find in the industrialized world,</i><br>
<i> &gt;and how all stats indicating a 'livable' environment seem to be far above</i><br>
<i> &gt;that in any other industrialized polity I am aware of.</i><br>
<p>
Point taken, having never visited NH so I'll take your word for it. My<br>
original point (several posts ago ;-) was that the existance of<br>
'big-governement' does not necessarily lead to economic collapse or even<br>
reduced growth.<br>
<p>
 Michael Lorrey:<br>
<i> &gt; &gt;Other nations that have followed suit now enjoy stronger economies </i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt;than their stagnant socialist neighbors.</i><br>
 <br>
 To which I replied:<br>
<i> &gt;We have been over this before but maybe it did not register or something,</i><br>
<i> &gt;the above sentence is abosulute and total B.S. (tough but that's what it</i><br>
is).<br>
<i> &gt;European countries with the most extensive welfare systems like Germany and</i><br>
<i> &gt;the Netherlands are the strongest economies on the continent. And their</i><br>
<i> &gt;currency's are a hell of a lot more stable than the US $.</i><br>
<p>
That was my point, if you want to state that welfare-systens are always bad<br>
for an economy, prove it. But make sure you got your facts straight.<br>
<p>
 Michael Lorrey:<br>
<i> &gt;Various socialist sympathizers here have expressed disbeleif that such a </i><br>
<i> &gt;system could result in anything but chaos, as they have no faith in the</i><br>
<i> &gt;ability of the common man to desire to live peacefully.</i><br>
<p>
In stating my belief that the absence of a state leads to chaos I was<br>
refecting on my experiences in several countries were a power-vacuum left<br>
by a crumbling governement was quickly filled by drunks driving pick-ups<br>
and shooting anythying that moves. I was talking about a situation were the<br>
state is absent, not downsized, as you yourself seem to consider a 'good<br>
idea'. I wonder what would happen to the US if the federal governement<br>
ceased existing overnight (I'd watch from a safe distance though - remember<br>
LA?).<br>
