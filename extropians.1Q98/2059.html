Great point.  <br>

The TransNexus of Ralph and Tanya is very flexible, and this is what I<br>
really like about their extropian community, as well as Freeland Nexus (the<br>
"tent" surely will stand out in history as being the extropian fun wild<br>
party alternatives of the late 20th Century!)<br>

One of the joys I experienced over many years of traveling was the different<br>
types of communities I lived in. I think the ones I really learned the most<br>
from, and had the most fun were the communities where there was a sense of<br>
respect for others' views. <br>
<p>
Thus the poem that Michael Butler posted a couple of days ago is noteworthy:<br>
to enjoy liberty, but not at the expense of another.  When we think of<br>
models for living arrangements, an important ingredient is not only the<br>
world-views of the individuals, but also the manner in which they interact.<br>
