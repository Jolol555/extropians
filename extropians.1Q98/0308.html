I knew I could count on y'all! :-)<br>
My primary oversight: Nuclear devices are illegal on Antarctica, the place<br>
were a hiker is most likely to need them. Some replies:<br>

<p>
Packing volume can also be an issue. Besides: "mister fusion" could provide<br>
so much heat that even at _extreme_ low temperatures (near the top of<br>
Olympus Mons) it would provide sufficient heating whereas insulation has to<br>
get thicker and thicker as temperature goes down.<br>

<i> &gt;I've heard that traditional Korean houses are heated by a wood-burning</i><br>
<i> &gt;stove under the house whose chimney is a meandering ceramic pipe buried</i><br>
<i> &gt;in the floor. A high-tech version of this might let you put the burner</i><br>
<i> &gt;outside the tent while still getting nearly all the heat into the tent.</i><br>
<p>
But how to operate is then? Remote control? You really don't want to leave<br>
the tent if it's forty below and a force 10 wind is blowing. Also the<br>
size/wheight and complexity of the burner goes way up. And burning fuel is<br>
not a longterm option (2 persons can last a week on 1 liter if it is just<br>
used for melting snow and cooking, when fuel is used for warming the<br>
amounts required are two or three times as much).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt; - Forget about the tent.</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;   And buy the thickest goose-down sleepingbag you can find (mummie).</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;   1400 gramms of down and a pertex/nylon outershell should keep you</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;   happy 'till about 40 degrees below zero.</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt;As I recall, the problem is to keep the heat in while letting the</i><br>
<i> &gt;moisture out. There are many super-lighe and cheap insulators, but</i><br>
<i> &gt;most also trap moisture. What about using a super lighe insulator</i><br>
<i> &gt;such as bubble-wrap in conjunction with a counter-flow heat exchanger</i><br>
<i> &gt;to let the moisture out?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, one of the biggest problems is perpiration condensing/freezing on the<br>
outside of your sleeping bag or, even worse, inside the outershell clogging<br>
the down and reducing it's insulating effectiveness. The best solution so<br>
far seems to be a nylon liner inside the sleepingbag, as long as your wear<br>
thermal underwear (the Startrek stuff) it's not too sticky and it ups the<br>
range of the bag by 5 degrees.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt; Even better would be a fusion-pile that uses snow/water/air as a</i><br>

Good point, hadn't thought of that.<br>

I've used insulated tents in the Arctic, they're great as long as you don't<br>
have to carry them. We had sledges that allow 200 or more pound of gear (as<br>
opposed to 55 in a backpack when your climbing up a hill)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Mold a quick loose-packed igloo around the tent?</i><br>
<p>
This can (and has) worked if there is loose snow, not too much wind and if<br>
you want to spend time shoveling snow after putting up your tent at the end<br>
of day. This combination is rare if you're in a high&amp;cold environment.<br>

Down is one of the last natural materials that has not been replaced yet by<br>
polymers in outdoor gear (As cotton, wool and manilarope has). I had a<br>
sleebingbag made-to-order by my supplier and have never been cold since<br>
(even at -35C inside the tent). Regrettably it's very vulnerable to dirt<br>
and moist.<br>
The way hollowfibers are going I would expect it to completely replace down<br>
in 10 years.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;A good insulation choice would be to carry a</i><br>
<i> &gt;second dome tent slightly larger than the one you intend to stay</i><br>
<i> &gt;in, (1-2" is best) you erect your tent inside the other, you'd be</i><br>
<i> &gt;amazed at how well this works. </i><br>
<p>
Ouch! that's another 8 pounds! Not to mention a small heap of cash ;-)<br>
Nice in a base camp that does not have to be moved, but they're generally<br>
not that cold to begin with (well, cold's relative ;-).<br>
If wheight is not so much of an issue an insulated tent that was mentioned<br>
in another post is great (expensive though).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Is there snow available? Build a Quinzee, which is the loose snow</i><br>
<i> &gt;version of an igloo. Just make a big pile of snow with whatever is</i><br>
<i> &gt;available: shovel, snowshow, hubcab, cardboard (were talking</i><br>
<i> &gt;general survival now) be sure to dig a couple of feet down, the</i><br>
<i> &gt;trick to a quinzee is that snow forms layers at different</i><br>
<i> &gt;temps/water content, when you mix it all up in a big pile it will</i><br>
<i> &gt;freeze solid, and can be easily hollowed out. I've built these at</i><br>
<i> &gt;the military cold weather facility at Bridgeport Nev at -60 at</i><br>
<i> &gt;14,000 feet.</i><br>
<p>
I've built ice-iglo's but never a Quinzee. Sounds cool, I mean great ;-)<br>
I'll give it a try when I have a chance (next month maybe).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;We forget what a great insulator snow is, it's only fault</i><br>
<i> &gt;is that its an insulator that starts to melt at 0 degrees C.</i><br>
<p>
True, when the tent get's half-buried in a snowstorm it's actually warmer.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Second is to eat properly, no dieting here, calories like crazy...</i><br>
<p>
Yes! Go 4000m+. Eat 4.5 million calories a day and still lose wheight! ;-)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Third is to drink enough water, cold fools the body into</i><br>
<i> &gt;dehydration, a liter per 20 kilos body weight per day is needed</i><br>
<i> &gt;(like the metric bit?) just to stay even, more to stay comfortable.</i><br>
<i> &gt;The best thing to do if you feel chilled? Drink water (no alcohol).</i><br>
<p>
Tea or soup is even better, water from snow is almost pure H2O and you lose<br>
a lot of minerals sweating all day. People in the himalayas often put salt<br>
in their tea instead of sugar (also because it's cheaper).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Check to see if the maker of your stove has</i><br>
<i> &gt;a separate catalytic heating attachment, you'll burn much less</i><br>
<i> &gt;fuel, much lower emissions and get lots more heat.</i><br>
<p>
Also a good idea! I haven't looked into this for my MSR whisperlite, having<br>
concentrated on minimizing the wheight of my equipment.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;When I was a boy-scout, they used to have these really neat pocket</i><br>
<i> &gt;catalytic heaters, the big model was the size of a small paper back</i><br>
<i> &gt;book, you'd state the element, and close the lid (they looked like</i><br>
<i> &gt;big zippo lighters) then drop it into a red flannel pouch and pop</i><br>
<i> &gt;it into your pocket. I don't know if there still made, I've got a</i><br>
<i> &gt;friend who's a scoutmaster checking on it.</i><br>
<p>
I've tried them but I'm pretty sure the energy density is considarebly<br>
lower than high-octane fuel I burn in my stove. My supplier has very small<br>
plastic chemical heaters that are handy as a part of a first-aid kit but<br>
I'm not sure they would be practical for several weeks.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Now, electricity! There are a number of manufacturers making</i><br>
<i> &gt;ruggedizeds (sp?) solar panels, you could put it on the outside of</i><br>
<i> &gt;the backback, and charge while climbing! The beauty of it is that</i><br>
<i> &gt;it would get more efficient the higher you go!</i><br>
<p>
Yes, when traveling in a sunny climate solarcells are a great way to charge<br>
a battery. I does take a nice clear sky to really get some power though. I<br>
used a laptop in the Andes last year for logistical calculations and<br>
analysis of GPS-data. Six solarcells about the size of CD's powered it in<br>
basecamp and charged the batteries (Also of the GPS and VideoCam). Lotsa<br>
power in good wheather but difficult to store (remember the story of the<br>
electric car?).<br>
<p>
<p>
So: there seem to be at least some outdoor types here, who's coming on a<br>
climbing expedition to Mars? I believe Olympus Mons is more than tree times<br>
Everest in height! Or maybe we can do something on this planet a bit sooner<br>
;-) Anyone interested in an Extropian/Transhuman hike in the Rockies maybe?<br>
