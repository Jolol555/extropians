The software industry is burdened by many entropic practices. See below for<br>
glaring generalizations.<br>
<p>
Most people who write code (at least, in my experience over 20 years, here<br>
in Silicon Valley and in Minneapolis) do not truly treat the process as an<br>
engineering discipline. "Real" engineers are taught to keep notebooks, and<br>
some do. Software "engineers" mostly aren't, and mostly don't--and regular<br>
people who develop software, say dink around with databases or<br>
spreadsheets,  certainly mostly don't. Where's the payoff? I have _results_<br>
to obtain! Etc.<br>
<p>
Professional programmers are rewarded for heroics; many tend to have a<br>
strong maverick or maestro streak (which has good and bad points); and they<br>
don't have any idea of what their "batting average" (ex.: coding error rate<br>
per KLOC) is--to name a few shortcomings.<br>
<p>
This is not meant as finger pointing; when I made my living programming, I<br>
was the same way. Still am, to too great a degree. Discipline is hard, and<br>
if it isn't emphasized it goes away.<br>
<p>
To my mind, the things mentioned in "Bjarne's" interview are emblematic of<br>
a general "out of focus" problem; blaming the language is an easy out.<br>
"Bjarne" is really finding fault with bandwagons and fads du jour and the<br>
resultant lock-in and job-security b.s.<br>
<p>
And he's right about that. Hype is not conducive to good design. Good<br>
design is hard. Following fads is easy. And giving the boss what he expects<br>
is "smart".<br>
<p>
Similar groupthink and yesmanism have led to failure even in supposedly<br>
"zero defects" environments: vide NASA and Challenger. C++ was not a<br>
factor, but the substrate issues were. But returning to your question...<br>
<p>
Languages that _don't_ put a burden on expression get a bad rap, too. But<br>
some of them are the best languages in the world for quickly writing<br>
bug-free software, as frequent embedded system use supports. Go figure.<br>
