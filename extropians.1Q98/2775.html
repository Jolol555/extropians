Sorry, I tend to widen it out so that multiple message quotes don't cause so much word wrapping. It<br>
would be nice if they developed a one character standard (say, an underlined numeral) that communicated<br>
the number of quotes, etc.<br>

I dunno, my dad designed a prototype for the fast flux nuke reactor at Hanford with a slide rule....<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; have said to a contractor that insisted on doing all its engineering</i><br>

No, but the attitude that causes them to continue to use them is.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Sure it works pretty well. Englascii is a fine standard for may</i><br>

Sure, unless that person reading their mail was using a palmtop device that could read mail, but<br>
couldn't browse the web...<br>

Current netiquette was developed to work around 2400 baud modem speeds. As the standard is now moving<br>
beyond ten times that speed, its time to expand our horizons.<br>
