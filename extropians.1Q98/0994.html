Why does it repel you?  Extropy is about rational thought, so what<br>
rational reason have you got against human culling, genocide or<br>
general murder?  Of course, you could argue that culling people is a<br>
bad idea because maybe you'll accidentally kill someone who would have<br>
been useful, etc.  But I'm talking about the act, what I want to know<br>
is for what rational reason does this *idea* repel you?<br>
<p>
I ask this not just because it's a difficult question, but because<br>
Extropy has rationality at its core.  Now it's possible to think of<br>
rational reasons for war, genocide, culling or anything else you care<br>
to mention, but when a reason against it is called for we tend to fall<br>
back on morality, ethics, and right and wrong.  These IMHO are weak<br>
arguments against raw and unrelenting rationality, so what defenses do<br>
we have against someone who's taken a very different slant on Extropy?<br>
