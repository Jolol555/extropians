<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you give examples of justice that isn't revenge?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; While victims families may feel like they have avenged the death of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their loved one when a murderer is put to death, but as far as I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tell, the death penalty serves two functions: a) it is supposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; serve</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as a deterrent, and b) it permanently removes from society in a manner</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that is far less expensive than life in prison those individuals who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have proven their in ability or unwillingness to function in society</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with respect for the right to live of others. You may call it</i><br>
<i>&gt; revenge, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; call it evolution in action.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Any form of justice (imprisonment, death penalty, lynching, shunning,</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc.) has two additional functions:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A) They impose the idea that the "crime" is unjust which, although it</i><br>
<i>&gt; may act as mild deterrent, also leads people to believe that the crime</i><br>
<i>&gt; is "wrong" and "shouldn't happen" which hinders their want to defend</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves.  We have been made to believe that criminal behaviour</i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't meant to happen, the problem is just because we say something</i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't meant to happen it doesn't go away.  Our legal system relies</i><br>
<i>&gt; solely on the blind faith of all people in the system - you have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; abide by these laws, and hope that everyone else does the same.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; B) They cause more of the behaviour that has been deemed "criminal" in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the first place.  Enforcing law creates enough lawlessness to break</i><br>
<i>&gt; the system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Justice is the need for revenge - when someone commits a crime against</i><br>
<i>&gt; you, what reason do you have to contact the police?  The crime has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been committed, and unless the assailant has taken something</i><br>
<i>&gt; irreplaceable you have little or no reason (other than revenge) to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I highly doubt and dispute the idea that the only reason we see justice<br>
for murder as a need for revenge. If it is not made a strong meme in<br>
society that ending anothers life without cause is wrong, morally<br>
ethically, and legally, then those with sociopathic and psychopathic<br>
tendencies will feel free to act out in the open, and the mayhem<br>
resulting will bring utter chaos. Not to mention that being permissive<br>
on ending another's life puts our own at greater risk of being ended.<br>
