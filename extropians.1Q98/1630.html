It has been said here before that there may be humans still living with<br>
neolithic technology at the time of "transcendence" of the first real post-<br>
humans.  This statement captures the idea that the future is certainly not<br>
evenly distributed and points to the fact that as we on the cutting edge of<br>
transhumanism contemplate the coming of post-humanity literally billions of<br>
humans struggle their entire lives with poverty and ignorance.  <br>
<p>
I've recently been reminded of someone who seems to embody a clearly extropian<br>
approach to the social, economic, political and moral issues raised by these<br>
facts.  Muhammad Yunus' Grameen Bank and its associated enterprises<br>
(<a href="http://www.grameen.com/gfly.htm">http://www.grameen.com/gfly.htm</a>) embody many of the extropian principles in a<br>
broad front of efforts to "more evenly distribute the future." Yunus makes so-<br>
called "microloans" (on the order of $50-$100) to would-be entrepreneurs in<br>
the third world (especially in the Indian subcontinent).  Most of his<br>
borrowers are women, who use the credits to establish small businesses such as<br>
irrigation services, textile manufacture, small-scale retailing and the like.<br>
Borrowers are organized into neighborhood credit-guarantee associations that<br>
multiply as one member after another utilizes Grameen credits, much on the<br>
model of American midwest agricultural credit co-ops at the turn of the<br>
century, but on a much smaller scale.<br>
<p>
Apparently Grameen has been wildly successful.  Here's an excerpt from an item<br>
that can be found amongst Grameen's material on microloans at their website<br>
(<a href="http://www.grameen.com/grameen/gbank/micro/trinews.html">http://www.grameen.com/grameen/gbank/micro/trinews.html</a> ):<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Microcredit was invented 20 years ago in Bangladesh </i><br>
<i>&gt; by Muhammad Yunus. Today, Professor Yunus's Grameen </i><br>
<i>&gt; Bank and copycat organizations have 3.5 million women </i><br>
<i>&gt; borrowers; adding their dependents, that amounts to about 20 </i><br>
<i>&gt; percent of Bangladesh's population. In the latest</i><br>
<i>&gt; elections, held on June 12, 1996, these newly enfranchised </i><br>
<i>&gt; flexed their muscle. The Islamic Society, the fundamentalist </i><br>
<i>&gt; party antagonistic to the West that wants to keep women at </i><br>
<i>&gt; home, lost 14 of its 17 seats in Parliament.</i><br>
<p>
Friday, NPR carried a news item about Yunus' latest venture: Using his bank's<br>
microloans, he is selling solar-powered cell phones to poor people in<br>
Bangladesh. (<a href="http://www.grameen.com/grameen/gtelecom/index.html">http://www.grameen.com/grameen/gtelecom/index.html</a>). They pay for<br>
themselves quickly in villages that have never known any form of<br>
telecommunication, and serve as a vector for modernization on many fronts.  An<br>
example cited was the use of the phones by village farmers to check market<br>
prices for their produce to reduce exploitation by grain traders.  The NPR<br>
story noted that Grameen Communications supplies phones to its customers at a<br>
price of $300 per unit.  The Bangladeshi government phone system was selling<br>
them for about $50,000.  Grameen's web site reveals that Yunus' next plan is<br>
to set up a wireless, solar-powered internet system in Bangladesh for the same<br>
purpose, using the same financing methods.  Now THAT'S what I call extropian:<br>
Using "bottom-up", highly distributed systems of networks based on principles<br>
of individual effort and responsibility, people are employing innovative means<br>
and the highest available technology to bootstrap themselves upward.  The next<br>
time you're feeling a little discouraged, stop by Grameen's website for a shot<br>
of enthusiasm!<br>
