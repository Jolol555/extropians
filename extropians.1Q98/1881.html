Y'know, I've been wondering why those Project Aquarius and Millenial Project<br>
people are not getting anywhere. Duh, they could easily be buying up some of<br>
the hundreds of surplus oil tankers sitting in ports around the world to start<br>
their independent communities. Oil tankers are at least 1000 feet long, the<br>
size of a Nimitz class aircraft carrier, which houses a crew of 5000. With no<br>
airport to support, an oil tanker based community could easily support that<br>
many in much more spacious accomodations. link several together into a large<br>
raft or catamaran or trimaran and you're talking real space. Using those empty<br>
holds for starting workroom and you could get really grand. Olympic swimming<br>
pools, huge dance halls, and indoor rain forests/arboretums.<br>
<p>
Buy a couple Russian submarine nuclear propulsion systems  for the ships and<br>
you're golden. I don't know if I'd trust such a large investment only to wind<br>
power.....If they only wanted to anchor the boats, they could easily generate<br>
all of their power needs from wave generation.<br>
