Actually, I do agree that extinction is happening.  However, most of the organisms marked as extinct (large higher organisms), don't seem to be terribly missed by the environment as a whole.  The disappearance of your arbitrary large animal appears to have little or no impact on the environment.  Beyond any aesthetic reasons, what serious disasters have been caused by the absence of the carrier pigeon or dodo bird?  I have the suspicion that most plants and insects would barely miss the absence of the majority of higher organisms.  I am not advocating the purposeful extinction of any animal, but I question the real impact of doing so.<br>
