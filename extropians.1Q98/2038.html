As you said body cloning especially body transplantation  as performed by<br>
neurosurgeon Robert White, MD, Ph.D. (CWRU) [See<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9356/Webbio1.htm">http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9356/Webbio1.htm</a>] is *VERY* likely<br>
to be banned.  As proposed by Paul Segall, Ph.D., one could generate<br>
anencephalic clones that are "brain dead" due to telencephalon removal at 6<br>
weeks gestation.  (If abortion is legal, why shouldn't this be as well?)  The<br>
benefit of the Atlantis Project (See <a href="http://oceania.org/">http://oceania.org/</a>)<br>
and maybe the Millennial Project (See <a href="http://www.millennial.org/">http://www.millennial.org/</a> ) is a<br>
separate nation-state or - city state like Singapore - is the libertarian<br>
foundation that would be built into the Constitution of such a venture.  Of<br>
course, it is more practical to just go to a tropical/Carribean  island  that<br>
wants American dollars and doesn't care where they come from for now but in<br>
the long term a floating artificial city would be a great testament to human<br>
ingenuity and achievement, a showcase of transhumanist ability to create and<br>
posthumanist culture as well.<br>
