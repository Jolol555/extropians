<i>&gt; The overwhelming majority of Europeans citizens agrees with this law as</i><br>

<i>&gt; On one side we have a group of people claiming that one is human after</i><br>
<i>&gt; conception because 'something' happens then even though they don't don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; know what that something is.</i><br>
<p>
As I have said, I know what it is, and its entirely a legal matter, not any<br>
spiritual matter. Not one person here has come up with a single jurisdiction on<br>
the planet which recognises an individual's citizenship prior to birth. Find just<br>
one and you'll have a legal basis to extend rights to a fetus. Since every<br>
jurisdiction knows what sort of immigration and extradition problems that could<br>
create, none of them will touch it with a ten foot pole. A fetus has no rights.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; On the other side we have a group of people saying that somewhere during</i><br>
<i>&gt; the growthproces a fetus becomes a human even though they are not sure when</i><br>
<i>&gt; precisely.</i><br>
<p>
I would say that it would be a matter of measuring the processing bandwidth levels<br>
of the fetuses brain. This would also probably be proportional to the number of<br>
neurons in the fetal brain. Then come up with a figure representing the minimum<br>
number of neurons a child could survive with outside the womb. Thats your precise<br>
point of delineation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Neither side seems to be able to bring 100% solid scientific or ethical</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'proof' for their opinion (at least I have't heard it). It then becomes a</i><br>
<i>&gt; question of who's is going to force their opinion of who. No-one is forced</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have an abortion (AFAIK). I respect the fact that some people would</i><br>
<i>&gt; never have an abortion because they feel 'it would not be right'. That's</i><br>
<i>&gt; OK. However, I do not think that gives anyone the right to enforce their</i><br>
<i>&gt; opinions on others.</i><br>
<p>
This is one of the majorly annoying things about prolifers. They try to claim that<br>
the Bill of Rights does not guarrantee a 'freedom of choice', yet they do not<br>
acknowledge that it also does not guarrantee a 'right to life'. The Declaration of<br>
Independence states that 'men are endowed by their creator with certain<br>
inalienable rights, among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.<br>
Whether you regard your 'creator' as god, nature, or merely your parents (which<br>
one?) seems to be irrelevant, but the D of I is not looked upon by the Supreme<br>
Court in the same manner as the USC. In the Bill of Rights, the 9th and 10th<br>
Amendments state that all rights not enumerated in the constitution are reserved<br>
by the people or by the states (which they themselves are delegated by the<br>
people). That the 'right to choose' is not mentioned is irrelevant, as it is<br>
implied that it belongs to the people, unless they delegate it to the state (which<br>
is where state laws can be used to outlaw abortion, and where Roe v. Wade was an<br>
improper decision, in that it presumed federal authority to restrict state rights<br>
which the poeple had previously delegated to them).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The _problem_ is of course that those who are against abortion feel that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fetus being aborted is a human who is killed based on the opinion of</i><br>
<i>&gt; others.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And then we're full circle.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I do not know if it's possible to break this so I'll choose for individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom of choice.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; then left to weigh the relative importance of curtailing for a few months</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; a persons right to make a certain decision (and the ensuing discomfort of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; childbirth) vs the possibilitity of taking a human life. Believing in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; mandatory seatbelts, DWI laws, and other minor loss of freedoms,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Having a baby when you're 16 is not a 'minor' loss of freedom. I will</i><br>
<i>&gt; problably define the rest of such a persons life. And the fact that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; baby has a mother who may not yet be ready for the task of raising a child</i><br>
<i>&gt; could very well define a large part of the baby's life too. So with all due</i><br>
<i>&gt; respect I would say that there is a bit more involved than wearing a seatbelt.</i><br>
<p>
I daresay that being so big against abortion in a community can even destroy its<br>
school system. Take my own hometown here for example. When I was in school, in the<br>
early 80's, girls who got pregnant had no problem getting an abortion. Because of<br>
this, we had extremely few girls who dropped out to have kids. Not one in my own<br>
class did. As a result, typically 70% of graduates went on to college. We had one<br>
of the highest average SAT scores in NH, which itself at the time had the highest<br>
average SAT scores in the country (while at the same time spending the lowest per<br>
capita on education, go figure).<br>
<p>
Since I graduated, the fundamentalists have gained power in the School Council,<br>
and have successfully banned the use/distribution of contraceptives in school,<br>
even by school nurses, or for the recommendation by school staff to a student to<br>
visit any doctor or family planner that recommended or performed abortions. They<br>
also, through protests, were successful in forcing almost all medical<br>
professionals performing abortions to either cease and desist or leave the area.<br>
They helped found Hannah House, a place for pregnant teen age girls to live, and<br>
forced the school to not act biased against girls who had had kids.<br>
<p>
Now apparently the school system has been so adversely affected that grades and<br>
test scores have dropped, there are at least a dozen or more girls at the high<br>
school getting pregnant and having their kids, and  the drop out rate has risen so<br>
high that the high school is in danger of losing its accreditation. So there are<br>
second hand effects to teen age birthing.<br>
