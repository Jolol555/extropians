<i>        &gt;In a determinsitic view of reality, deterrence is ineffective         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;for people who are not possessed of free will.  They cannot be         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;'deterred' from committing crimes.</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
Just the opposite is true. If there are reasons for a person's actions and <br>
then you change those causes, such as passing a law to punish wrongdoers,  <br>
then you change his actions. On the other hand, if a person's actions had no  <br>
causes then nothing you did could change him because his behavior would be  <br>
random.<br>
              <br>
<i>        &gt;Well, are you a determinist, or aren't you?          </i><br>
<p>
I am not. Quantum Mechanics has shown that some things can happen for no <br>
reason, that is, they are truly random, I just don't think randomness has <br>
anything to do with free will.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You say that you believe in free will, and this is not a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;deterministic idea... what's the scoop?</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Free Will means being unable to accurately predict what you will do until you <br>
actually do it, this is perfectly consistent with determinism.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;libertarianism tends to deny causality </i><br>
<p>
Never heard the word used that way before.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I do not believe (as you seem to) that because a decision has a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;causality, that it is then an 'un-free' decision.  </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
I don't believe it either. Freedom means not knowing what I'll do but always <br>
doing what I want. I consider it a compliment not an insult if somebody tells  <br>
me there are reasons I want the things that I do.<br>
       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What is incompatible with free will is not causation, but compulsion.</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
I agree, compulsion means having no freedom, and that means having no choice, <br>
and that means doing what you don't want to do.<br>
