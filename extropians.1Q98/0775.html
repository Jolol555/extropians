Hi John<br>
<p>
At 09:12 PM 1/15/98 -0800, you wrote:<br>

<p>
Sorry, usually I greatly enjoy your posts and agree with what you have to<br>
say, but in this case I would counsel against your own rhetorical<br>
technique.  I'd prefer to see a short, reasoned rebuttal.  As it is, all<br>
you're saying is `yah yah, you're another!'  Besides, I think it needs to<br>
be acknowledged that most people *will* be revolted by the prospect of<br>
harvesting decorticate cloned bodies (even more than they would if they let<br>
themselves think about harvesting machine-sustained cadavers right now).<br>
Mockery of the kind you use here only works, I suspect, when one taps into<br>
the audience's own suppressed agreement with one's case.  Here, your<br>
response is too easily dismissed as `just another kook, Jim'.  IMHO.<br>
<p>
Regards, Damien<br>
