Just my personal 0.02 ECU ;-)<br>

With a Laptop and a cell-phone you can save a lot of time and aquire more<br>
freedom of movement. I do most of my E-mail processing 'on the move'<br>
(planes, trains and automobiles). The time I save this way (+/-2h/day) can<br>
be used for all kinds of personal and professional development, meeting<br>
people &amp; generally having a good time.<br>
<p>
For many people on this list 'work' will consist of the processing/creating<br>
of information. With mobile tools you can do this anywhere, why sit in an<br>
office when you can be at the beach! Even typical 'office-things' like<br>
meetings can be held outdoors if the weather is good. it takes a bit of<br>
organizing and convincing your collegues but brainstorming seems to work<br>
better if the brain operates on a fresh breeze ;-)<br>
<p>
I've also found that it is possible to train your body to function on 5-6<br>
hours of sleep instead of the full 8 most people would like to have to feel<br>
totally rested. It can be difficult at first but after a while you<br>
automatically wakeup on time. The fitter you are the easier this seems to<br>
be (in my experience).<br>

This 'evidence' would probably not be admissible (other listmembers van<br>
probably give more details here - not my field).<br>

<p>
If you walk into a meeting and everybody takes of their jacket you're going<br>
to look pretty foolish wearing a bulletproof vest, microphones and a<br>
firearm on your body. It would make many customers itchy and might severly<br>
hamper your job-opportunities (I make no judgement if this is justified,<br>
but most companies have a rule that says 'No guns in the office' or<br>
something).<br>
<p>
But yes, If you absolutly have to go to, say, Afghanistan or Libanon a<br>
kevlar vest would be smart (even though they make you sweat like a pig ;-).<br>
But then you'll also want to bring a helmet and first-aid kit (including<br>
your own sterile equipment to prevent HIV infection and 4 liters of blood<br>
plasma). But my #1 piece of equipment in these areas would be a<br>
Inmarsat-phone that allows you to call for medical help from anywhere in<br>
the world (prices have come down to about $3K - surf to <a href="http://www.nera.no">http://www.nera.no</a>).<br>
<p>
Some other behaviour for health improvement:<br>
- Minimize the time you spend on board planes (lots of radiation at<br>
  30000ft and those aluminium hulls do little to protect you).<br>
- Take first-aid training. This will probably not benefit you directly<br>
  but you can set an example for others to follow.<br>
- Nicotine greatly increases the chance of vascular disease but<br>
  significantly lowers the probability of contracting braindiseases<br>
  like Alzheimer or Parkinson (take your pick).<br>
  <br>

<i> &gt;What strategies work</i><br>
<i> &gt;best, how do we motivate ourselves to change our lives?</i><br>
<p>
The best motivation seems to be a _fast_ positive return on your behaviour.<br>
Once you get positive feedback on your actions it becomes a easy to keep<br>
them up. being part of a community or group, such as this one, where people<br>
support your ideas (like taking a Cryo-contract) also helps a lot. When you<br>
feel you are part of something that's bigger than you it's not so hard to<br>
strive for long-term goals because you're doing it with a bunch of great<br>
people and they working towards a goal itself a positive experience.<br>
