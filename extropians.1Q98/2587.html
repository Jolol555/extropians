Dear Friends,<br>
<p>
	British author and lecturer Anthony Blake (The Intelligent Enneagram, <br>
Shambhala 1996) is circulating the note below for comments <br>
and possible co-participants in events exploring the theme <br>
of communicating with higher intelligence.<br>
<p>
<p>
COMMUNICATION WITH HIGHER INTELLIGENCE<br>
<p>
Below is a sketch of a perspective on the theme of higher <br>
intelligence which we might address in some future event. <br>
<p>
The idea is that our understanding of communication with<br>
higher intelligence must depend on our view of what that<br>
intelligence 'is'. John G. Bennett [The Dramatic Universe,<br>
4 vol] spent considerable time opening up this question,<br>
and I have tried to follow some of his remarks to the<br>
effect that now we can address what this intelligence is in<br>
a way that was not possible before. Certainly we can at<br>
least separate out the background of religious belief<br>
(though not forget it). <br>
<p>
You may easily see that this sketch could be the basis of<br>
an interesting book, if any of us had the time to devote to<br>
it. <br>
<p>
It is also offered here as a stimulus for thinking of people with<br>
insights into these questions, who might be persuaded to take part in a<br>
seminar devoted to them, or some other similar gathering.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
15 Hypotheses<br>
<p>
A. The first group concerns the hypothesis of higher intelligence as a<br>
human potential.<br>
<p>
       1.  The hypothesis of higher faculties at work<br>
       within human beings generally but which most of us<br>
       are not in touch with, largely clustered around (a)<br>
       conscience (moral order and will), and (b) intuition<br>
       (direct perception, intelligence). It is proposed<br>
       that accessing such faculties can make our<br>
       intelligence higher (more moral, or more high<br>
       powered).<br>
<p>
       2. The hypothesis of exceptional people, or<br>
       genius, i.e., higher faculties which exist in only a<br>
       few people. It is sometimes avowed that what we need<br>
       most is the cultivation and utilisation of genius.<br>
       This also can tie in with the future bioengineering<br>
       of higher intelligence.<br>
<p>
       3. The hypothesis of co-operative intelligence. If<br>
       and when people 'coalesce' their individual<br>
       intelligences, through consultation, Bohmian<br>
       dialogue, or other techniques, then a higher order<br>
       can emerge. <br>
<p>
       4.  The hypothesis that artificial intelligence and<br>
       advanced computing will link in the future not only<br>
       indirectly with human modes of social interaction<br>
       (e.g., the internet) but directly with personal<br>
       perception and congnition (enhanced real world<br>
       perception and mental capacity, virtual reality).<br>
<p>
       5. The combined hypothesis of a special group of<br>
       people (still basically human) in whom higher<br>
       intelligence is embodied. This is the assertion of a<br>
       'hidden directorate', or hidden masters, who<br>
       influence human affairs through 'sensitive'<br>
       intermediaries. Along with this may be added the<br>
       postulate of an intrinsic social order of<br>
       intelligence.<br>
<p>
B. The second group postulates an independent class of entities as the<br>
higher intelligence.<br>
<p>
       6. The hypothesis of the noosphere. In this<br>
       hypothesis, the natural evolution of the planet<br>
       produces a realm of intelligence that is<br>
       independent of the human population, hence, that<br>
       there is an 'Overmind', Gaia, or some such, arising<br>
       out of physical laws.<br>
<p>
       7. The hypothesis of superplanetary but still<br>
       limited intelligences, that the solar system, the<br>
       galaxy, etc., are in some sense, on some scale,<br>
       intelligent entities.<br>
<p>
       8.  The hypothesis of supernatural intelligence and<br>
       agency involved in evolution and/or in revelation to<br>
       chosen human beings. We note here the two-fold form<br>
       this takes in terms of 'angels' or 'messengers'<br>
       (religion) and a creative or guiding demiurgic intelligence.<br>
<p>
       9. The hypothesis of extraterrestrial intelligence,<br>
       ascribed to highly advanced beings of other<br>
       planetary systems or dimensions.<br>
<p>
       10.  The combined hypothesis of planetary destiny,<br>
       in which it is proposed that every planet with life<br>
       has an ordained destiny differing from any other. <br>
<p>
<p>
C. The last group of hypotheses concerns intelligence as 'hidden in<br>
time'.<br>
<p>
       11. The hypothesis of the ancestral wisdom. This<br>
       ancient hypothesis ascribes wisdom or higher<br>
       intelligence to the corpus of the ancestors, from<br>
       whom we may receive guidance.<br>
<p>
       12. The hypothesis of intelligence as belonging to<br>
       the future. In this hypothesis, higher intelligence<br>
       is positioned in the future, though a future of a<br>
       special kind. For example, in a cross-over concept<br>
       between hypotheses, some people explain some of the ET<br>
       phenomena as we ourselves coming from our own<br>
       future.<br>
<p>
       13.  The Omega Point theory of Frank J. Tipler, in<br>
       which the future intelligence of general universe<br>
       can reach into and redeem the past.<br>
<p>
       14. The hypothesis of higher intelligence as the<br>
       fastest rate of becoming and as belonging to the<br>
       present instant. This is the rarest form of belief<br>
       in higher intelligence. <br>
<p>
       15. The combined hypothesis of higher intelligence<br>
       as time itself. In this hypothesis, an attempt is<br>
       made to combine all other hypotheses and begin from<br>
       a starting point that does not distinguish human<br>
       forms of intelligence from others. <br>
<p>
<p>
D. What remains<br>
<p>
There is an open area concerning the 'fact' that higher intelligence is<br>
itself limited and supposes a higher order still. In this, we might also<br>
consider that our very idea of 'higher' might be called into question.<br>
Some evolutionary biologists say that we cannot even call human<br>
intelligence 'higher' than that of any other species. <br>
