Just some further, rather abstract, thoughts about the memes we share.<br>
<p>
I recently read the paper "Cultural r/k Selection" by Agner Fog in<br>
Journal of Memetics<br>
(<a href="http://www.cpm.mmu.ac.uk/jom-emit/1997/vol1/fog_a.html">http://www.cpm.mmu.ac.uk/jom-emit/1997/vol1/fog_a.html</a>).<br>
<p>
Fog suggests a memetic analogy to the r/K strategies in biology. An r<br>
strategy occurs when there are good opportunities for expansion but<br>
also considerable dangers (such as predators or natural hazards). Then<br>
it will be advantageous for a species to breed as fast as possible and<br>
spend little resources on each offspring. If the population is limited<br>
under scarce resources rather than predation, then a K strategy<br>
emerges where there are few offspring, but much resources are invested<br>
in them. Mice and insects follow r strategies, humans and other large<br>
mammals tend to follow K strategies.<br>
<p>
Fog then applies this to memetics, suggesting that the same strategies<br>
apply to memes. Memes that can quickly spread but also are in constant<br>
danger due to predation from other memes, unreliable vectors or<br>
attacks from opposing memes would follow a r strategy, something Fog<br>
calls a regal strategy. Regal memes tend to emphasize the importance<br>
of proselytization, defence of the memetic in-group and homogenity of<br>
belief - it is more important to spread the meme than liking it. K<br>
strategies among memes (called kalyptic by Fog) appear when the meme<br>
cannot easily expand into other meme-pools and there are little danger<br>
for it. In this case it becomes more important to keep the hosts of<br>
the meme interested in it, so selection for positive effects of being<br>
infected will occur, there is little need for keeping the variants of<br>
the meme similar etc. Fog then goes on analysing cultures with this<br>
framework.<br>
<p>
Note the similarity between "movements" and regal strategies, and<br>
traditions/idea currents and kalyptic strategies. A movement seeks to<br>
expand its base, becoming more able to influence more people. They<br>
often seek to retain something of an ideological purity (which often<br>
results in them splintering into mutually competing sub-movements). An<br>
idea current has no real drive to expand, it spreads to hosts that can<br>
accept the meme and have little need for orthodoxy. If Fog's model is<br>
correct, then we should expect movements to appear in memetic niches<br>
where it is possible to gain many converts, but there is also plenty<br>
of opposition, and idea currents in memetic niches where it is not<br>
easy to gain new converts, but little opposition.<br>
<p>
By now I think it is fairly clear that extropianism is more of a<br>
kalyptic strategy than a regal strategy. Our memes are directed<br>
towards making our lives happier, more efficient and futuristic, often<br>
being based on cooperation with other, related memes. While there are<br>
plenty of people to persuade about extropianism, only a relatively<br>
small subset are likely to become extropians which suggests the need<br>
to invest more energy in creating convincing and useful<br>
meme-offspring. <br>
<p>
If extropianism could somehow find a form that is easily transmitted,<br>
this meme would likely evolve towards a more regal strategy with less<br>
allowances for unorthodox thinking, becoming a typical movement.<br>
<p>
Note that neither of these strategies is any "better" than the other<br>
in some moral sense. Kalyptic strategies tend to allow more freedom,<br>
but they are not evolutionarily stable against invading regal<br>
strategies. Regal strategies are able to spread quickly to a large<br>
population and in the lack of any outer enemy gradually becoming<br>
kalyptic (and hence vulnerable to unexpected new regal competitors). A<br>
regal form of extropianism might not be entirely in accordance to the<br>
current ideals, but would be able to amass the strength to get a lot<br>
of practical transhuman work done (if it was lucky), the current<br>
kalyptic form is pleasant but often not very practical.<br>
