<i>&gt; From: John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; "den Otter" &lt;otter@globalxs.nl&gt;  Sat, 14 Mar 1998 </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Justice is punishing harmful acts in proportion to the crime and in      </i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;a consequent manner.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Justice is doing what is needed to prevent harmful acts from being repeated.</i><br>
<p>
I would rather call that an objective of justice. My definition tells you how to<br>
do it in a civilized and functional way, which fits better the official definition<br>
of justice.<br>
 <br>
[justice --1. just conduct; fairness; exercise of authority in maintenance of<br>
right 2. judicial proceedings] From: _The Concise Oxford Dictionary_<br>
<p>
                    <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Punishments can be fully "customized" and monitored so that no-one       </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;is hurt worse than intended. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you could prove that then I'd have no objection to corporal punishment, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but I don't think it's possible, or at least not  practical.</i><br>
<p>
It is a known fact that practiced executioners know precisely how to inflict<br>
anything from a slight discomfort that leaves no marks to a horrible lingering<br>
death. Especially the Chinese were (are?) true masters of torture. Add to<br>
that modern (medical) science &amp; technology, and a system where the<br>
executioner is severely punished when killing the convict/otherwise overdoing <br>
the punishment *and* full audio/video monitoring and you'll have a pretty <br>
good system. Not 100% foolproof of course (but what is?), but certainly a<br>
lot better than today's prison systems. And that's what counts.<br>
<p>
After all, imprisonment has a different effect on different people just like<br>
corporal punishment, but unlike the latter it is very hard to customize<br>
(how do you measure psychological damage?) Surely you don't think<br>
that a year in jail is equally hard on your grandmother as it is on a <br>
tough streetfighter?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;if you can't take the heat then *stay out of the kitchen*! No-one        </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;is forced to become a violent offender </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My point is that people should not be punished differently for the trivial </i><br>
<i>&gt; reason of having different physiques, and that nobody should receive the </i><br>
<i>&gt; equivalent of a death sentence for committing a very minor  crime.</i><br>
<p>
My point exactly, that's why I think we need better (safer, healthier, <br>
automated) jails (later: cryoprisons) and customized corporal <br>
punishments for violent offences. Right now jail time sometimes means <br>
mutilation/rape/death, even in western countries. Even worse, the least <br>
guilty suffer most.<br>
<p>
                    <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Primitive man presumably acted even more on impulse than we do, and      </i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;feelings of hate and revenge might have helped him on his way to        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;the top. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; Certainly, but so what? My genes have their agenda and I have mine, </i><br>
<p>
At least, that's what you *think* ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; besides, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm a lot smarter than my genes, even they know that, that's why they gave me </i><br>
<i>&gt; a brain. </i><br>
<p>
Gave? How benevolent of those genes!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you look for wisdom or morality in Evolution you will not find it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Evolution is brutal and stupid, it has no foresight and can't design worth a </i><br>
<i>&gt; damn, </i><br>
<p>
Yet somehow, it works...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; that's why biological creatures are so poorly made.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but unfortunately we *are* those creatures, and I don't think we understand<br>
ourselves well enough to start throwing out traits we don't like, especially basic<br>
ones like agression (it is extremely stupid to get rid of agression unless you're<br>
100% sure that you're the only one in the universe, and by definition you can<br>
never be sure. A being without agression is a/k/a a sitting duck).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Vicious slander can ruin someone's reputation for life, and can lead     </i><br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;to loss ofjob(s), family problems, severe mental damage (sometimes       </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;suicide) due to rejection by the community/society etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If your skin is that thin then never say anything controversial, be just like </i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody else, make sure  you don't do anything  creative, don't be too good </i><br>
<i>&gt; at your job and don't make a lot of money, such people are so dull the </i><br>
<i>&gt; tabloids would never dream of slandering them. Nobody is forcing you to </i><br>
<i>&gt; aspire to more and if you can't  take the heat then *stay out of the kitchen*! </i><br>
<p>
Obviously a world as you dicribe would suck badly. That's why we need law to<br>
make sure that you can do your stuff in relative safety without fearing that some<br>
opportunistic moron will do damage to you or your property. Creativity is<br>
something that has to be protected and stimulated. Anti-slander laws can help.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A word about reputation, my reputation is an opinion on the value of my past </i><br>
<i>&gt; actions that's useful in determining the probability that my future actions </i><br>
<i>&gt; will be of value too, but my reputation is not set by me nor is it used by me, </i><br>
<i>&gt; it is used and set by others. </i><br>
<p>
And someone can thoroughly wreck it so that others will judge you by lies<br>
rather than your true qualities, with all the consequences. IMHO people<br>
will think twice about slandering you when they know they will be punished<br>
by "a large band of thugs" a/k/a government.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;People don't really care about the truth, they want dirt </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then these people are fools, and I don't care much if a fool thinks I'm a </i><br>
<i>&gt; fool. </i><br>
<p>
We live in a world filled with fools of every discription, so even if you don't<br>
care what they think their actions will interfere with your life. Slander can<br>
lead to mobs with pitchforks and torches outside your door (burn that<br>
child molester -- or whatever), or to not being able to get a decent job and<br>
a lot more nastiness. That's the way the world works.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you feel differently and their opinion is that easy to sway then </i><br>
<i>&gt; just sway them back.</i><br>
<p>
It's not that easy, certainly when a powerful enemy (like a company<br>
or some sect) has targeted you. <br>
                    <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;No amount of oral or other defense can fully reverse the effects of      </i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;slander</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Especially if the "slander" is true. If there were an all powerful oracle </i><br>
<i>&gt; that could always tell truth from untruth then it might be a good idea to </i><br>
<i>&gt; stop those who spread ideas that are untrue, and if politicians always knew </i><br>
<i>&gt; how to make the correct decision I'd be in favor of a strong central </i><br>
<i>&gt; government, but pigs can't fly and such oracles are a little hard to find.</i><br>
<p>
A slander trial forces the attackers to produce some hard evidence, something<br>
you could hardly do on your own. No evidence means that it was indeed slander<br>
which meens fines/jail etc. are in order. <br>
