<i>&gt; &gt; the Third World outnumber the number of abortions since the Roe v. Wade</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

    Morality and Values!  I love this discussion.    Doug: The abortion debate has<br>
everything to do with choice and what is human and Ethiopian. Most don't recognize<br>
this.<br>
    Michael: There is enough fault for everyone. We are all equally to blame.<br>
    Authoritarian regimes are directly at fault for allowing their people to die in a<br>
horrible manner.  The developed world (including all of us) is also at fault for<br>
allowing starvation and death to occur when they have the power (either individually or<br>
through their government) to stop or mitigate it.<br>
    Two key questions. Should we individually or collectively value all human life?  Do<br>
we have a (moral) responsiblity, individually or collectively, to prevent or reduce<br>
human suffering and death?  If you answer yes, the failure of anyone to act is wrong<br>
(If you disagree, I would like to hear).<br>
    There is no doubt in my mind that most people would drop whatever they are doing<br>
and fly to Ethiopia or picket the US Capitol, do what ever it takes, and try to rescue<br>
their spouse or sibling or parent or offspring if they were one of those starving<br>
statistics.  Most people would think it strange (irresponsible even) if I mentioned<br>
that my wife was "...dying in some Ethopian hell-hole. Darn those Warlords, it's their<br>
fault.  Oh, by the way, did you see those Knicks last night, blew another game..."  I<br>
bet Ethiopia would be hip-deep in Marines if Hillary C. was lost somewhere in-country.<br>
<p>
    In any case, what is good for my wife or Hillary should then be good enough for the<br>
rest of humanity.  We can stop or reduce the dying, we just don't think a million<br>
Ethiopians are worth one spouse. That is immoral.<br>
    Which brings us to abortion. When do those cells become human and worth protecting?<br>
Are they equal to Etiopians? The proverbial gray area seems to be one mircosecond after<br>
conception to one microsecond before conception (though some old-fashioned Chinese<br>
peasents push the boundry a little further).  I honestly believe that no one here, or<br>
anywhere else, has put forth a good arguement that at "________" (period of time) after<br>
conception, you become a human and then get this special protection.  I am then left to<br>
weigh the relative importance of curtailing for a few months a persons right to make a<br>
certain decision (and the ensuing discomfort of childbirth) vs the possibilitity of<br>
taking a human life.  Believeing in mandatory seatbelts, DWI laws, and other minor loss<br>
of freedoms, I vote (dare I say choose) life over discomfort.<br>
  Which then brings us to transhuman concepts.  To quote "2001", I believe something<br>
'wonderful' will happen to us in the future.  Technology will insure that.  I am trying<br>
my hardest to ensure we are as responsible with all that new power, technology and with<br>
each other, and thus avoid David Bailey's worry:<br>
        "I believe this issue will (and perhaps has already) arise in the future as the<br>
utility of a large portion of the human population will be marginalized to virtually<br>
zero.  This marginalization might occur through the technologies such as<br>
nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and so on."<br>
    However, my mom always taught me that "the good guys always win in the end" and my<br>
Christian faith also teaches me the same.  So I just fight the good fight, don't worry<br>
to much and try to be happy :-)<br>
    Wasn't there a song..?<br>
