<i>&gt;From the AP Wire:</i><br>
<p>
Washington.  Eileen Collins, the nation's first female space shuttle <br>
pilot, will be promoted to shuttle commander Thursday at a White <br>
House ceremony with President Clinton and his wife Hillary, officials <br>
said Wednesday.  She will be the first woman in charge of a U.S. <br>
space mission.<br>
<p>
Collins has flown two shuttle flights, onein 1995 and another in <br>
1997, and has been in line to be assigned as shuttle commander.  She <br>
will be named at a ceremony where Clinton will emphasize the <br>
importance of math and science studies.<br>
<p>
Two shuttle missions are on tap.  Columbia is to carry an X-ray <br>
telescope into space later this year, possibly in December.  Endeavor <br>
is to make a space station delivery in December, though that mission <br>
may slip into next year.<br>
<p>
(AP also mentions that Stephen Hawkings will be giving a lecture at <br>
the White House afterwards, but I don't think any of us are going to <br>
get to see that!)<br>
