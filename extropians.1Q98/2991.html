<i>        &gt;every bit of information is tide to every other bit of information.  </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Change one piece of history and you've got to change it all.  </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
I'd only need to do that if I wanted to make the network consistent and<br>
thereby useful, but not if I just wanted to fuck it up.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Besides, this is an autonomous meta network, everything you do</i><br>
<i>        &gt;creates additional data.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It creates contradictory data and a huge amount of it. All that crap must be<br>
examined with software tools, tools vulnerable to tampering.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;you can't hack in because it has nothing to hack into (it's open,</i><br>
<i>        &gt;remember?).  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I remember, that's why It would be easy as pie to make the network useless.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You can't change history for the reasons above.  </i><br>
           <br>
You look in one part of the network and find ironclad evidence that I<br>
committed a murder on Thursday, then you look in another part of the network<br>
and find ironclad evidence that I did not commit a murder on Thursday.<br>
Did I murder anybody on Thursday?<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You could try and destroy the data but it's completely distributed, </i><br>
           <br>
Far from  trying to destroy the data I would make thousands or millions<br>
of copies of it, all suitably mutated of course, and leave you the job of<br>
determining the truth.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;which makes things very hard to find.  </i><br>
           <br>
If it's hard for me to find stuff on the network it's hard for everybody,<br>
so what's the point of the network?<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You could try to orgainise somekind of anti-openess conspiracy, but</i><br>
<i>        &gt;the majority of people have more to gain from openess than from</i><br>
<i>        &gt;privacy (i.e. losers.)</i><br>
           <br>
That's probably untrue and certainly irrelevant. The perfect world would be<br>
one where everybody and everything was open, except for me.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There's are no network administrators, it's completely distributed</i><br>
<i>        &gt;autonomous anarchy.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If it can do that then it's no longer an autonomous network, it's an<br>
autonomous AI and all bets are off in predicting what it will decide to do<br>
with a fifth wheel like the human race.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;But the data must be machine-readable.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't see your point, cryptographic data is almost always machine-readable.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;For the sake of argument, let's say you managed secret communication.</i><br>
<i>        &gt;Who would you send communicate with?</i><br>
      <br>
My banker.<br>
                  <br>
<i>        &gt;What would you say?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
"Here's the money I made from selling 26 tones of cocaine to children, don't<br>
pay taxes on any of it, just put it in a standard anonymous encrypted account.<br>
Tell your Russian friend that 7 tones of heroin is too much to pay for his<br>
H bomb, it's only 3 megatons for goodness sake and it's not like he's the<br>
only one around selling nukes, I refuse to go higher than 6 tons of marijuana,<br>
take it or leave it."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Do you think you can organise people against the network?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Don't know, don't care.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What are you going to stop?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Stop the trust people have in the network by making it hopelessly unreliable.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What can you steal from an open society?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Money and power, and because of that it won't be open for long.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;How can you bribe an open society?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
With money and power. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What have you got that they haven't?</i><br>
<p>
Money and power.<br>
<p>
