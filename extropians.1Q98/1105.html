      C'mon!  So first we have predatory feaudalism (or whatever) and thus <br>
      a distribution of property (and the positional advantages property <br>
      buys over time), and the resulting patterns of injustice aren't of <br>
      any concern?  That's just a stale 'conservative' apologia for <br>
      inherited privilege!  Hardly fair, let alone optimal.<br>
      <br>
      Why does 'capital' hire 'labour'?  Why does not 'labour' hire <br>
      'capital' for time-preference (interest) plus a risk factor?  Why do <br>
      we still have a _hierarchical_ -- 'Crony-Capitalist' -- verticalist <br>
      structure for our prevailing version of a 'free-market' society, <br>
      when most people would prefer a much more 'horizontal' reticular -- <br>
      Agorist! -- pattern of economic interactions?<br>
<p>
      What objection (if any) would you advance to this idea?<br>

                HOW TO RESOLVE THE LARGER 'BT PROBLEM'?<br>
<p>
   Much of BT's network was built via capital levies on subscribers' phone <br>
   bills.  Clearly, when BT was 'denationalized', this should have been <br>
   done simply (and without megabucks in 'sweeteners' and 'fees') by <br>
   mailing out equal shareholdings in BT to every elector on Monday <br>
   morning<br>
<p>
   BT staff seem to _hate_ BT -- most people do too, after all.  Who can <br>
   forget the cartoon of a man making a call from a phone box, while Busby <br>
   (remember him?  &gt;:-} ) leaned out of the 'returned' slot and <br>
   surreptitiously picked the punter's pocket...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
                     NOW, IMAGINE THIS FUNNY SCENARIO:<br>
<p>
      [A] BT staff start to 'work to rule' and make innocent mistakes...  <br>
      Such things do happen... They all hate the bloody company, anyway...<br>
<p>
      [B] The BT Network declines. BT will never get into America now: <br>
      whoever would possibly want to import an MI5 spy network?  &gt;:-}<br>
      All of BT's competitors go all-out for new business.<br>
<p>
      [C] Job opportunities boom with BT's rivals, creaming off all the <br>
      more 'mobile' and/or competent BT staffers.<br>
<p>
      [D] Rumours spread like wildfire that BT is on the skids...<br>
<p>
      [E] The great offshore Hedge Funds (like George Soros' Quantum Fund <br>
      -- remember Black Wednesday? ERM?  The Tories? ) smell 'blood in the <br>
      water', and start running relentless bear raids against BT stocks <br>
      and shares round the clock.  BT shares decline more or less gracefully.<br>
<p>
      [F] Meanwhile President Clinton has issued Executive orders tasking:<br>
<p>
      the Central Intelligence Agency<br>
<p>
                  http;//www.odci.gov/cia<br>
<p>
      and the National Security Agency<br>
      <br>
                  <a href="http://www.nsa.gov:8080">http://www.nsa.gov:8080</a><br>
<p>
      to become commercial 'players.'<br>
      <br>
<p>
      Top flight outfit, NSA -- US$ 30,000,000,000 budget, 100 000 <br>
      brilliant,dedicated and playful staffers, worldwide SIGINT and <br>
      Electronic Warfare capabilities, you know...  Now tasked to gather <br>
      commercial and poplitical intelligence which can be useful to <br>
      American companies.  America has lots of fiercely competitive telcos <br>
      (Actually, anyone with NSA's resources could bring down BT's entire <br>
      network in around five minutes...).<br>
<p>
      (A former CinCPAC and DIRNSA (Director, NSA) is a friend of mine...)<br>
      <br>
      [G]  BT slides inexorably into receivership.  In the reconstruction, <br>
      the public finally receive the shares they should have received in <br>
      the first place, and the BT staff run BT as a co-op, replacing the <br>
      'senior management' and the board (Good Riddance!), and take on any <br>
      external management advisers necessary for the 'difficult bits.'<br>
<p>
      We-all then have our own phone company in our own hands, BT's <br>
      previous -- 'looter' -- shareholders see their shares zeroed, and <br>
      the good guys (all of us!) win!  We can then have free local calls, <br>
      with competing trunk services, and superfast 'blinking' datacomms <br>
      services via spread-spectrum protocols over standard twisted-pair <br>
      lines.<br>
<p>
      Ideal for 'Blackbird' MacroComputers!!!  Project details from:<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;       There is a legal maxim: "Non Dat Quod Non Habet" (you cannot give </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;       what you do not have).  97% of American land is owned by around 3% </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;       of the population, or so I understand.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can easily prove that you understand incorrectly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That leaves only 3% of the land owned by anyone other than those 3% </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the population.</i><br>
<p>
      That's a bit evasive!  I'm more than happy to know the correct <br>
      distributions -- just amend the estimate to '97% of privately-held <br>
      American land is owned by 3% of the population, or so I understand.' <br>
      I think you'll find that the distributions of ownership are <br>
      _something_ like this.  If the estimate's quite wrong, I'd like to <br>
      know a more accurate estimate, for purposes of future discussions. <br>
