Agreed.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The introductory message to this list claims that Extropians may have an</i><br>
<i>&gt; interest in "rational ethics (ethics for survival and flourishing)". </i><br>
&lt;rant&gt;<br>
To survive and thrive (to be free of suffering, and full of joy) are the only things<br>
that really matter, they are the core of any rational ethics system. Ultimately,<br>
we all are motivated by discomfort-minimalization and pleasure-optimalization<br>
(unless the brain blows a fuse). Whether we like it or not, "it's like that, and <br>
that's the way it is". If everyobody stuck to pure rational ethics, this would<br>
ultimately benefit all, because helping others/not damaging them often pays<br>
off in the long run (or instantly). We don't need christian or socialist values<br>
(which *force* you to share, help etc.) to create a pleasant society; self-interest<br>
with foresight has largely the same positive results, minus the bad ones<br>
(sanctimoniousness) that are inherent to so many other memetic systems.<br>
Holier-than-thou beliefs/philosophies ultimately only cause moral decay,<br>
because virtually no-one can live up to their standards. A great example<br>
of the resulting sanctiomonious behaviour are the folks who one hand hand<br>
oppose the death penalty because it's supposedly "barbaric", while on the<br>
other hand they don't give a damn about the situation in prisons, where rape,<br>
beatings, extortion &amp; murder are commonplace. A rational system would<br>
be exaclty the opposite: there would be capital punishment (preferably<br>
so that the mode of execution fits the crime) for murderers (cryopreservation<br>
standard, just in case), and the prisons would be clean &amp; safe, with no<br>
(involuntary) physical contact between inmates, video/audio surveillance all<br>
over and highly automated (human guards are nothing but trouble) so that<br>
they no longer are a place where the least-guilty suffer most, and bad guys<br>
get even worse. Of course, this is just one example of rational ethics in<br>
action; the effect on the whole of society would be profound.<br>
&lt;/rant&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This must surprise a lot of list members, who seem to take a far more</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian view of ethics.  Many here seem to take the view that it's OK to</i><br>
<i>&gt; do what you like, so long as you don't harm anyone else. I challenge those</i><br>
<i>&gt; people to place a boundary around causing "harm to anyone else". </i><br>
<i>&gt; Every action a person takes will affect every other person to some small extent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can't live your life without causing harm to someone else. All you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; do is mitigate the degree of harm whilst promoting your objectives. I for</i><br>
<i>&gt; one have an interest in the "rational ethics" declared in the introduction.</i><br>
If you want to follow rational ethics, than you only have to worry about the<br>
most apparent damage done to others (or, more specifically: can I get away<br>
with it?) "Not damaging others" should not become a mindless dogma/taboo, <br>
that wouldn't be rational. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Which brings me, finally, to the point. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Someone you know, rationally, carefully and thoughtfully, decides that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is time to end their life. Such an action has a number of easily</i><br>
<i>&gt; identifiable anti-Extropic effects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What is the right thing to do? Do you give the person their liberty, or do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you exercise your "ethics for survival and flourishing" and forcibly remove</i><br>
<i>&gt; it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;From a rational ethics point of view, the choice is easy: you try to prevent </i><br>
the permanent destruction of someone you care about, even if this person<br>
doesn't want to be saved *at this time*. Freedom of choice does not apply<br>
to the mentally ill, IMO, just like it doesn't apply to small children. The only<br>
rational reason why someone would want to die is unbearable (mental or <br>
physical) suffering. If this can't be cured by today's medicine, euthanasia<br>
and cryonic suspension are in order. If the person in question is revived<br>
at some point in the future, he will be cured of all his physical and mental<br>
disorders, *and* he'll be hedonistically engineered so that satisfaction is<br>
guaranteed. And on this day, he will surely thank you from saving him<br>
from himself.<br>
