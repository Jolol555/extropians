<i>&gt;&lt;ANTIRANT&gt;My Libertarian views are not reactionary, at least not now,</i><br>
<i>&gt;considering that the status quo is a welfare liberal statist establishment.</i><br>
They<br>
<i>&gt;are hardly conservative. Approving of abortion? Approving of suicide and</i><br>
<i>&gt;assisted suicide? Approving of personal drug freedom? Approving of personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;choice in pornography, cryptography, etc.? Oh, I'm just a freaking nazi, I</i><br>
am.<br>
<p>
<p>
Well, the nazis approved something *they* called assisted suicide. It was<br>
called Euthanasia.<br>
<p>
There are different conservative groups. One is the religous-right,<br>
Republican group. You're hardly part of that group. But there's also a group<br>
of technology freaks that argue based on ideas that were refuted a long time<br>
ago. I call this conservative. You call it Extropy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not a bad analogy, but possibly more renaissance, depending on what</i><br>
<i>&gt;characteristics of the middle ages you are referring to. If you are talking</i><br>
<i>&gt;about free enterprise, low tax, self reliant, spirit of exploration and</i><br>
<i>&gt;adventure, then I wont argue.</i><br>
<p>
Spirit of exploration and adventure. ROTFL. A good way to describe the<br>
crusades in an advertising of the vatican.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To a transhuman, the sum of the self extends beyond the mere flesh body.</i><br>
Energy<br>
<i>&gt;and Material tools and resources are merely extensions of the self. As</i><br>
property<br>
<i>&gt;defines ones resources, property defines the self of a transhuman.</i><br>
Technology<br>
<i>&gt;was developed in order to more easily expand the size and utility of ones</i><br>
<i>&gt;property.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't disagree with this. I disagree, however, with the assumption that<br>
gun ownership and protection of non-transhuman property with deadly force is<br>
even worth discussing. I also disagree that natural selection applies to<br>
cultural evolution.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sure, which is why I enjoy playing with my new rifle, or my new fly rod, up</i><br>
at<br>
<i>&gt;the family cabin in the North Country, driving my red Jeep Cherokee 4.0</i><br>
liter<br>
<i>&gt;4x4 to get there, or just staying in town for the weekend and shooting a</i><br>
few<br>
<i>&gt;rounds of skeet, or going skiing. When I'm home, I like to play on my PC</i><br>
<i>&gt;equipped with an Intel P II 233 with 64MRAM, 4.8G of hard drive space, 6x</i><br>
CD rom<br>
<i>&gt;and 2x/4x CD writer, 4800dpi 24 bit color flatbed scanner, HP color</i><br>
printer, or<br>
<i>&gt;with my Casio digital camera. I can't decide, though, what to buy this</i><br>
summer<br>
<i>&gt;though, either an ultralight plane, or a share in an oil well in</i><br>
Louisiana....<br>
<i>&gt;decisions, decisions, decision.....</i><br>
<p>
<p>
All play and no work make Mike a spoiled brat :-). By playing, I don't mean<br>
this kind of entertainment (I won't even comment on your rifle mania). I am<br>
talking about playing with ideas, concepts, perception. You can do this with<br>
an Apple II. Or even with a pencil and a sheet of paper. Your Pentium II is<br>
not yet connected to your brain. Using your own brain is therefore more<br>
effective than using this "extension".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; This</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; planet could live much better with such 'forward thinkers'.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why thank you very much.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You're welcome. You know my position on the economic problems of today's<br>
society.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
Erik Moeller<br>
