<i>&gt; &gt; Perhaps we should all realize that capitalism will soon become an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; absurdity and cease to exist.  As technology increases productive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; capacities, and automates the whole process, you, me and all extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; may soon be able to sit on our butts, doing whatever we like, and still</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have all the goods and services we can dream of. . .absolutely free. .</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ..all without working.</i><br>
<p>
We don't have to wait around for this to happen perfectly for everyone.<br>
There are whole classes today for whom this is effectively true.  For many,<br>
market signals all point towards taking up space in somebody's cubicle farm.<br>
This is called Knowledge Work.<br>
<p>
The only incentive to really get off your butt (not literally of course)<br>
is to be able consume excess goods and services comprising the next<br>
level conceived of by marketers and desired by a television-addicted<br>
population.  (or is it?)<br>
<p>
What's your point?  Is this an ideal:  to sit on your butt?  I would argue<br>
that a little extrapolation seems to indicate that the abundance of goods<br>
and services you speak about (at least as they are provided in our<br>
current economic system) is predicated on a life of subtle slavery<br>
for many of the most "productive" (==predictable) citizens whose<br>
economic lives (production and consumption patterns) are hardly<br>
matters of conscious choice or will.  What does it mean to "do what<br>
we like" when the requirements for life are so easy to obtain at even<br>
the most modest levels of modern American society and most of the<br>
visible production and consumption is driven by marketing?<br>
