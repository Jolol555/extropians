<i>&gt; species were aquatic, and most were "primitive".</i><br>
<p>
OK, here it is, from chapter 2: "Some Animals Age, Some Don't" of<br>
Leonard Hayflick's _How and Why We Age_.<br>
<p>
	"But some animals do not seem to age at all, even when<br>
	protected by humans. If they do age, it occurs at such a slow<br>
	rate that their aging has not been demonstrated<br>
	convincingly. These animals increase in size indefinitely;<br>
	their growth may slow as the years go by but, apparently, it<br>
	does not stop.<br>
<p>
	Nonaging animals tend to be more primitive species. Typical<br>
	examples are lobsters and many, but not all, fish (sturegons,<br>
	sharks), amphibians (alligators) and reptiles (the Galapagos<br>
	tortoise). Nonaging animals do experience a peak in their<br>
	physiological functions at some point after their sexual<br>
	maturation, but as they continue to grow those functions do<br>
	not seem to decline. The classic example of indeterminate<br>
	growth associated with lack of aging is the fish called<br>
	flounder in the United States and plaice in England. The<br>
	female grows indefinitely and does not show age changes, but<br>
	the male reaches a fixed size and ages. The reason for this<br>
	difference is a mystery."<br>
<p>
The list I was referring to was unfortunately a list of records for<br>
various species, and not a list of whether they age or not. Still, it<br>
is clear that reptiles and amphibians at least have a maximum lifespan<br>
of several decades, while there is a great variability among mammals<br>
(humans are of course the longest-lived mammals). Fishes has great<br>
variability, but ages such as 75 for beluga, 82 for syuregon and 60<br>
for catfish clearly hint that they do not age. The same goes for<br>
invertebrates, bivalves can get 116 years old (Margaritifera<br>
margaritifera) or 220 (Arctica islandica), lobsters 50, Nautilus<br>
pompilus 20 and ant queens 27 years. In general we need more data here. <br>
<p>
So it seems that immortality (or at least extreme life spans) is<br>
physically possible in some groups of species. Unfortunately we do not<br>
have any mammals that do not age, so we don't know if it is applicable<br>
to us.<br>
