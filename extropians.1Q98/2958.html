<p>
Twice as many base pairs means twice as many UV hits at a given flux.  There's<br>
just not enough DNA, even in animals, to screen an appreciable amount of UV.<br>
<p>
The idea you have would have two main requirements:<br>
<p>
1) The exposure of the cell to the mutagen cannot depend on the amount of <br>
DNA in the cell.  Direct radiation is out, although free radicals from <br>
radiation would be OK.<br>
<p>
2) The mutagen must be largely eliminated by mutating DNA. If the mutagen<br>
is largely cleared by any other process, increasing DNA will just increase<br>
the proportion "cleared" by affecting DNA.  Also, if the mutagen is <br>
not destroyed or inactivated by mutating DNA, then obviously extra DNA<br>
doesn't help.<br>
<p>
The only mutagen I know of that would meet qualification 2 is other DNA.<br>
The idea that "junk" DNA provides a distraction for all those transposons<br>
hopping around has been suggested, although I don't know where.<br>
