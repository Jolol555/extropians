This is a bit disingenuous.  Current hypotheses of junk DNA origin hold<br>
that it comes from meiotic recombination errors and transposons, and<br>
possibly other similar things.  Given that origin, it will tend to<br>
have a complex fractal structure characteristic of many information-<br>
containing processes.  In a sense it *is* meaningful, because it <br>
records DNA duplication "errors" and thus can be a tool for analyzing<br>
evolution.  But it's not communication, just a record<br>
of a fractal process.  Certainly "language" is a lousy metaphor for this<br>
process.<br>
