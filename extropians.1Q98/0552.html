Just take a look at Jeremy Rifkin's work for a fine example of left <br>
Luddism that would soon see us surpassed in technology by the Amish.<br>
<p>
(And probably in population as well.) <br>
<p>
I remember, when cold fusion was hot news, reading a long article in <br>
the local paper explaining why Mr. Rifkin thought it would be <br>
horrible.<br>
<p>
A major reason (as represented in that article): it would allow us to <br>
strip-mine so much more land for coal.<br>
<p>
Think about that for a while.  See how many different ways the <br>
argument is simply ludicrous.<br>
