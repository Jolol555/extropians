On the assumption that one of the things these competing Powers compete<br>
about is the proper handling of mehums.  My point was that no abstract<br>
framework (whether a system of property rights or an ingrained injunction<br>
to respect diversity or whatever) would be robust enough on its own to<br>
police a massively more powerful Power, but that a proliferation of<br>
competing Powers very well might.  One Power who sees the likes of us as<br>
ubergoo feedstock may check the impulse to act on that assumption if she<br>
knows that others of her rank would take that as a violation of their own<br>
understandings of rights, respect, civility, or even the dictates of<br>
prudence (the unforseeable pleasure/unforseeable danger criterion). <br>

<p>
Yeah, if I had to be a Power pet I'd sure rather my Power incline more to<br>
the model of a Banksian Mind than that of a Vingian Blight.  Yikes!  <br>
