How to grow your own bypass <br>

ATLANTA (March 30, 1998 4:19 p.m. EST <a href="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</a>) -- For the<br>
first time, doctors have shown that injections of a genetically engineered<br>
hormone can help people with bad hearts grow their own bypasses -- an<br>
approach that could someday offer an alternative to surgery and angioplasty.<br>
<p>
The hormone, which occurs naturally in the body, triggers the heart to<br>
sprout tiny vessels to carry blood around blockages that cause angina pain.<br>
The results of the first experimental use, released Monday, showed that the<br>
treatment eased angina in 13 of the 15 people treated.<br>
<p>
The results are considered very preliminary, and the doctors caution that<br>
much more testing will be needed to know precisely how well it works.<br>
<p>
Nevertheless, Dr. Timothy D. Henry of the University of Minnesota, who<br>
directed the study, said, "We are excited by this. It is a unique approach<br>
to treating coronary artery disease."<br>
<p>
About 1 million Americans a year undergo either bypass or angioplasty. A<br>
bypass involves grafting tiny pieces of blood vessel onto the heart to<br>
shuttle blood around blocked sections of artery. Angioplasty uses a tiny<br>
balloon, threaded into the heart, to squeeze open narrowed passages<br>
temporarily.<br>
<p>
If all goes as the researchers hope, natural proteins called growth factors<br>
could offer a new alternative, especially for those who have already failed<br>
the standard approaches or cannot be helped by them.<br>
<p>
In this experiment, doctors injected genetically engineered vascular<br>
endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. The protein is made by Genentech Inc.,<br>
which paid for the experiment.<br>
<p>
All of the men and women had serious chest pain and could not be treated by<br>
angioplasty or bypass surgery.<br>
<p>
Among those helped was a man in his early 50s who had already had two<br>
bypasses and two angioplasties, yet was still crippled by angina. The<br>
growth hormone appeared to relieve his condition almost completely.<br>
<p>
Henry said the man told him that "the only side effect was that he had to<br>
go back to work."<br>
<p>
Doctors performed angiograms -- X-ray movies of the heart arteries -- on<br>
seven of the patients. Five of them showed significant growth of tiny blood<br>
vessels the width of a hair. Others tests indicted that the patients' heart<br>
tissue was getting more oxygen.<br>
<p>
Henry described the results at a meeting in Atlanta of the American College<br>
of Cardiology.<br>
<p>
"This absolutely looks promising," said Dr. Judith L. Swain of Stanford<br>
University. "This is a technology that's here."<br>
<p>
Dr. Michael Mann of Harvard Medical School called the research "a critical<br>
and bold step that sets the stage for larger studies" to answer whether<br>
this approach truly works.<br>
<p>
Those answers could come from a follow-up study, scheduled to begin next<br>
month at 25 hospitals, where doctors will test VEGF on 400 patients. The<br>
treatment is not available except in such carefully controlled studies.<br>
<p>
The body naturally responds to VEGF to stimulate the growth of new blood<br>
vessels in tissue that is starved of oxygen -- as the heart is in coronary<br>
artery disease.<br>
<p>
The researchers injected VEGF directly into the heart arteries while they<br>
performed angiograms. Henry said 30 other patients have been given simple<br>
injections of the hormone into veins, and the results of that experiment<br>
are not yet known.<br>
<p>
Last month, a team from Fulda Medical Center in Germany reported<br>
experimental use of a similar protein, called fibroblast growth factor, on<br>
20 patients. The patients were given the protein during bypass surgery.<br>
They improved, but it was unclear how much was due to the growth factor.<br>
<p>
Other researchers are experimentally giving bypass patients the gene that<br>
carries manufacturing instructions for VEGF. The idea is to trigger the<br>
heart to make more of the protein on its own.<br>
<p>
The results of these experiments on the heart have not been released.<br>
However, this approach has shown promise when used on people with clogged<br>
leg arteries that could have led to amputations.<br>
