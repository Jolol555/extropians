Just for the heck of it, I tried this.<br>
<p>
First I used the name that appears on my driver's licenses.  Of the <br>
first 20 entries, only the 13th was me: a newsgroup article I had <br>
posted, in an archive of a newsgroup I hadn't noticed I was <br>
crossposting to.<br>
<p>
Then I used the name that appears on this message.<br>
<p>
Of the first 20 entries, 19 were archives of this mailing list.  The <br>
other was an artifact of the fact that Altavista has a good indexing <br>
engine but no index-cleaning engine at all. <br>
