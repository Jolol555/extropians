Several years ago, when I was debating this subject as a subset of a debate on the<br>
usefulness of a mass transit system in Seattle (the debate was on the EICBBS, run<br>
by Bonneville Power and the Washington State Energy Office), these gov't boobs<br>
claimed that the government values your personal time (ie. any time you are not<br>
working one of your 40 hours a week) as worth absolutely nothing. I was claiming<br>
that since the mass transit system proposed would actually INCREASE the average<br>
transit time by 15 minutes, that this was a negative net economic value. I also<br>
used this to debate the merits of recycling, whether it was better for the<br>
resident to sort his or her own trash, or have it done automatically by the<br>
garbage company. These bozos just don't value your personal time as worth<br>
anything. It was rather amazing that these supposedly intelligent people could<br>
make such idiotic statements.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; As far as I can tell, it doesn't and therefore should not receive</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Making unusual compensation compulsory after a certain number of hours is</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I think your missing a very important point here.  Regardless of what is fair</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;compensation or not, the fact remains that the company has *taken away* money</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;from a more a powerful group.  Because companies need IT workers more than IT</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;workers need that company, why haven't IT workers realized that they are the</i><br>

<i>&gt; shortage</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;trends, that IT workers would counter any company plot to exploit them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with the testicles in their hands control those who own those testicles.   It</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;just makes plain economic and political sense.</i><br>
