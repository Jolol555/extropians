<p>
Public use?<br>
<p>

<p>
Public spending?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's a democtratic -webbased deciding/rule system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You can vote for everything concerning the public</i><br>

<i>&gt;e.g: a biotech firm, wants to expiriment with some</i><br>

<p>
Direct democracy with no limits on the powers of government???<br>
<p>
The premise is good, but...  Why not try eliminating public areas, and<br>
instituting a system of permanent (unchanging) minimalist laws?<br>
<p>
Also, I'm dubious that Transhumans from around the world would come and<br>
live on the island for fun.  Frankly, if I were to start an island like<br>
this, I would expect that the main source of immigration would not be<br>
biotech firms or a camping industry; but rather those thought to be<br>
criminals by authoritarian governments.  Simply by making it publicly known<br>
that the island is a permanent political asylum whose laws are strict but<br>
minimalist, a community may emerge from those who simply have no place else<br>
to go.<br>
<p>
We may even supplement this by building the harbor and the airport first;<br>
making the private choice (not the public policy!) to send out boats and<br>
planes to those places desperate to escape from their homeland and bring<br>
them to the island.<br>
<p>
Thoughts on this?<br>
<p>
                   -I *AM* GETTING BETTER-<br>
                 -I THINK I'LL GO FOR A WALK-<br>
