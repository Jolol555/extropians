Actually, they are paramount. If something has no rights, then such laws can<br>
only have a seriousness that is equivalent to abusing or being cruel to an<br>
animal. Charging someone with murder in this case is, IMHO, not likely to be a<br>
successful prosecution, if the defendant foreswore a jury trial, and followed<br>
through with any appeals necessary.<br>
<p>
As stated previously be me, which you've ignored, non- citizens are legally<br>
seen as 'honorary' citizens under agreements between governments that<br>
establish diplomatic relations. Granting any rights to the unborn in terms of<br>
citizenship is a sticky wicket that it seems nobody wants to try, as it will<br>
create a nightmare of immigration and extradition situations. If the US, for<br>
example, passed a law or amendment stating that life begins at conception,<br>
then everybody on the planet will want to 'vacation' in the US in the hopes of<br>
conceiving a child here, which will then be a US citizen, and will allow the<br>
parents to stay here on the gov't dole.<br>
<p>
You still haven't found any jurisdiction which will grant citizenship to a<br>
fetus.<br>
