Paul Hughes chastises:<br>
: ... How many of you have gone out on a date?  If you havn't found any<br>
: "extropian" women at heart, then you arn't looking in the right places.<br>
<p>
The places you suggest are the same places one looks for any mate.<br>
Sasha evidently is tired of that, and wants a way to improve the odds.<br>
<p>
As for me, I no longer care about sex enough (if I ever did) to pursue it.<br>
<p>
: Besides, Sasha,  who wants a clone of yourself to talk to on very<br>
: specific subjects that only you are interested in?  Don't you like<br>
: surprises?  Part of the joy of living and especially of being<br>
: involved with another person is the surprises they offer you in<br>
: ideas and perspectives.  Take a chance - date somebody who is<br>
: *not* an extropian - you might be surprised that they really are,<br>
: they just approach it from a very different semantic point of view.<br>
: This has been my experience.<br>
<p>
We're not all virgins here.  Sasha has a son.  I was married for ten years.<br>
