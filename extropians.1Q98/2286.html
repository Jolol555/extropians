<p>
[ Please direct replies to extropians-moderated@mit.edu. ]<br>
<p>
	I may as well announce it now.  3 weeks ago, I stepped down<br>
from the Extropians club that I cofounded with Jason Davis to finally,<br>
at last give science my all.<br>
<p>
	Why don't I just forward the two emails I sent to the<br>
extropians@mit.edu list?  They say everything I want to say, and more.<br>
<p>
	And with that, this club, the still-derecognized MIT<br>
Extropians, passes to whatever form it chooses to evolve itself into.<br>
I'll still forward useful information.  But whoever wishes to lead --<br>
our lists, next year's pamphlet, our group, its guiding philosophy --<br>
the door is completely wide open for you to do so.<br>
<p>
	And so, I wish you all the best -- that you may achieve what<br>
you set out to attain.<br>

<p>
	There's a reason for our 2-list breakup.  It was a necessary<br>
bifurcation.  I mean this literally, as in a second-order phase<br>
transition with two distinct phases.  If time provided, I could make<br>
the difference evident, sharp, but I've been too busy to even post my<br>
"stepping down" email.<br>
<p>
	As for -discussion, I happen to think the topics are<br>
legitimate topics.  -- but still...well...sigh...off the mark in many<br>
different ways.<br>
<p>
	Keep your eyes out for what happens in "large" intellectual<br>
discussions.  Right after our first Extropian gathering, I told Jason<br>
that it's a deep fact that large forums left to themselves inevitably<br>
default to talking about:<br>
<p>
	-politics<br>
	-economics<br>
	-religion<br>
<p>
	And lo and behold, left to itself, that is exactly what goes<br>
through -discussion these days.  These are *fine* topics, but I think<br>
there are ultimately more rewarding topics.  But maybe I'm putting the<br>
cart before the horse.  After all, I spent my years on politics,<br>
economics, religion, was a Counterpoint Editor-in-Chief, cofounder of<br>
SAFE (MIT's free speech group), the libertarians email list, and<br>
Extropians.  So who am I to talk?<br>
<p>
	These issues are the "contentious" issues involving large,<br>
often powerfully organized power structures, paradigms, morality.  I<br>
was always known for asking people 3 questions, always:<br>
<p>
	1) are you religious?  if not, what's your epistemology?<br>
	2) do you believe in immortality for humanity?  are you personally<br>
		interested in it?  why or why not?<br>
	3) what are your political views?<br>
<p>
	I file away all these answers.  Ally or non-ally, that's one<br>
of my first classifications.  Folks, like it or not, life is<br>
contentious and will remain so.<br>
<p>
	Well, I guess there needs to be a forum for politics,<br>
religion, and economics, sprinkled with some immortality and science<br>
talk.  I only wish people would spontaneously discuss *these* issues:<br>
<p>
	1) what drives you, what do you want above all else<br>
	2) what could help you, what's holding you back from it<br>
	3) what are you doing about it, are you happy about what you're doing<br>
<p>
	I had hoped our Extropians pamphlet would point the way to<br>
what is important.  By its very rather unusual nature, and the fact<br>
that people *obviously* felt it was important and worth responding to<br>
-- I hoped people would learn.  But our list is dominated by a lot of<br>
intellectual followers.<br>
<p>
	I want to understand the universe and change the world.  After<br>
much thought, I decided both are best served if I pursue science and<br>
put activism on the backburner.  It will always be there, and I will<br>
always have the opportunity.  But later.  And I would leave changing<br>
the world to others if I could.<br>
<p>
	In the meantime, I am taking: 2.152 (nonlinear control), 7.05<br>
(biochem), 8.059 (quantum 3), 8.08 (stat mech 2), 8.334 (grad stat<br>
mech 2), 9.371 (differential geometry), 18.702 (algebra 2).  Even with<br>
that, I spend 1/3 of my time during the week learning and thinking<br>
about material outside my classes.  I work 75-85 hour weeks, about 2/3<br>
of which I consider useful work.  Of that, maybe 1/4 is really<br>
insightful learning.  But you know, even if you plod, you're still<br>
soaking information.<br>
<p>
	There is so much I want to understand!  I wish I could do<br>
everything, learn everything.  I can't, dammit, I'm strapped by my<br>
body, mind, mortality.  Damn it, curse it, but restrained I am, most<br>
of all by my willpower.<br>
<p>
	So how well have I been doing?  Fairly well.  My problem sets<br>
have been decent.  It takes getting used to, but you can learn to pump<br>
5-7 out per week.  What I really regret is every hour I waste not<br>
reflecting more deeply about the science, not making the insights or<br>
connections that really bring clarity to what I'm doing.  I resent the<br>
hours when I'm taken away from one subject to work on another.  Right<br>
now, I'm stretched thin, and need to scale down my projects.  This<br>
means I need to focus on *only* classes for the next week, rather than<br>
try to understand measure theory, etc.  :)<br>
<p>
	My life began 3 weeks ago.  Until then, I wasn't living.  And<br>
I knew it.<br>
<p>
	But now it's for real, and god, it's so exciting, so scary.<br>
What if it's all for nothing?  What if knowledge is just a lot of<br>
pretty theory?  What if the greatest science needs breakthroughs<br>
(especially mind science) that won't happen in my life?  What if I'm<br>
just a nothing?  I already know I can be a great pedagogue, a great<br>
teacher -- but what about research?  Scientists aren't remembered for<br>
pedagogy.  What if I'm 40 and I know the reason I failed was because<br>
of a lack of will -- how could I live with myself then?  Or if I'm in<br>
the wrong field, and wasted 20 years on an illusion or lesser field?<br>
What if I should have done something else?  Writing?  Activism?<br>
<p>
	Every person must go through this and come to grips with it<br>
alone.  Ultimately nobody can possibly help you.<br>
<p>
	So take heart, yon Extropians, the struggles are real - but<br>
you wouldn't want to live any other way.<br>
<p>

Subject: inspiration, motivation, major achievements in science and engineering<br>
<p>
[ This email is a mouthful, but hey, I put some good stuff in it, so<br>
I hope you get something out of it. ]<br>
<p>
	Thanks for the responses, guys.  Two people emailed me already<br>
on the main list asking what happened 3 weeks ago.  :)<br>
<p>
	Actually, Ed, I did mean a second order phase transition. :)<br>
-moderated and -discussion slowly differentiate and the system would<br>
undergo "spontaneous symmetry breaking" because I'd only send good<br>
stuff to -moderated.  But hey, first-order (discontinous) works, too.<br>
<p>
	Funny, "phase transition" is not found in the index of<br>
Strogatz's nonlinear dynamics text.  And not once in 8.334 (which Ed<br>
and I are taking) did I hear anyone say a phase transition is a<br>
bifurcation in the Landau free energy Psi(m) function.<br>
<p>
	Jason asks: Who's Landau?  Geez, Jason.  :) All I've been<br>
learning in the first 3 weeks of 8.059 are Landau levels in the<br>
presence of a magnetic field and in 8.334 about the Landau free energy<br>
function.  :) I'm not exagerrating.  Landau probably contributed more<br>
to mean field theory, and thereby to modern statistical mechanics'<br>
critical phenomena and condensed matter physics, than any other<br>
physicist.  But Ed was referring to Landau's pedagogy.  Here, I'll<br>
quote from Gasiorowicz, p. 503, "The [Quantum Mechanics] book by<br>
Landau and Lifschitz is one of a series of superb books covering all<br>
of theoretical physics."  It's the only series of its kind.  Granted,<br>
other physicists also left a solid written legacy.  Feynmann's justly<br>
famous _Feynmann Lectures_ and several textbooks (among them stat<br>
mech, QED) and even lectures on computation and gravitation.  Steven<br>
Weinberg wrote textbooks on quantum field theory and general<br>
relativity, the two as yet irreconciliable theories in physics, texts<br>
used in MIT's grad classes.<br>
<p>
	I've been going off on this to illustrate a point about how<br>
fame is distributed in science, and to ask how important is it really.<br>
You can't ignore these issues.  In my physics classes of 1998,<br>
probability says some person sitting in them is eventually going to<br>
win the Nobel Prize.  Who is he?  How does he learn or research that's<br>
different from anybody else?  And if I were to take enough biology<br>
classes, I could say the same, more by sheer mass of # of people<br>
taking these classes, and the fact that MIT is #1 in molecular<br>
biology.  These things matter.  We work for idealism, learning,<br>
knowledge, but don't tell me you chose your scientific or engineering<br>
applications without a thought of personal ambition.<br>
<p>
	Landau was an excellent case point.  "The great Russian<br>
physicist Lev Landau," as my excellent 8.059 lectures notes say, but<br>
how many people outside physics know this?  Similarly, Murray<br>
Gell-Mann.  We didn't even mention names like Murray Gell-Mann in our<br>
Extropian pamphlet.  Yet, even if particle physics is one of highly<br>
competitive endeavors where a lot of people are working on it at any<br>
time, Gell-Mann is still the man generally most given credit for:<br>
quarks, symmetry, and renormalization theory.  This is huge!<br>
<p>
	And quite unlike what a lot of people say about genius in<br>
their twenties, both of these men did a lot of their great work past<br>
their 30's.  Feynmann: QED by age of 31 (path integrals, Feynmann<br>
diagrams), liquid helium and superfluidity mid-30's, weak<br>
interaction/beta decay (which he thought was his greatest work), which<br>
was by 39.  In his mid-40's (early 1960's), he did the Feynmann<br>
lectures.  Einstein's general relativity: mid 30's.<br>
<p>
	What does this mean?  It means these men were generally doing<br>
their greatest work a full decade or longer after they first started<br>
taking physics classes for real.  This is far from the standard myth<br>
of young genius.  Folks, it only happens in math, where you have<br>
prodigies, and even then, many a mathematician's greatest work is done<br>
in the years of his full maturity.  Norbert Weiner was a child<br>
prodigy, yes, but his greatest opus (which made its way into<br>
Cybernetics) was done when he was sporting a great beard.<br>
<p>
	(I did an overview this January of famous composers.  Brahms<br>
is the only composer who finished a powerful, Promethean work when he<br>
was 25: the Brahms First Piano Concerto (my theme piece).  All other<br>
composers did their great work in their 30's or later.  Mozart wrote<br>
nothing of major consequence until he was 29 (the 20th piano<br>
concerto).  All his great operas were in his early 30's until he died<br>
at 35 having not completed his Requiem (arguably his greatest<br>
non-opera piece).  Quite a contrast from the Mozart child prodigy myth<br>
spawn by _Amadeus_, eh?  Beethoven finished his 3rd, 5th, and 9th at<br>
34, 38, 53 respectively.  Mahler wrote his greatest symphonies 5 and 6<br>
in his early 40's.)<br>
<p>
	Again, the lesson is clear.  Ramanujuan and child prodigy<br>
stories are rare.  People often do their greatest creative work after<br>
years, often 10 or more, from their first training.  It is true in<br>
composition, it is often very true in writing (but not always; Asimov<br>
and Orson Scott Card's most famous novels were finished for the most<br>
part by late 20's -- but hey, that's almost 10 years isn't it?)<br>
<p>
	Back to people people who aren't given their proper due...<br>
<p>
	Arthur Kornberg of biology.  DNA Polymerase 1 and 3, RNA<br>
transcriptase.  Watson and Crick discovered the double helix<br>
structure, fine, but Kornberg isolated the major enzymes that<br>
replicate DNA and transcribe RNA, surely a greater overall<br>
contribution than Watson and Crick's.  From what I can tell in 7.05,<br>
he strikes me as the greatest biochemist/molecular biologist of his<br>
time.  Double helix structure, fine...so we know the shape of DNA.<br>
Important, yes.  But the runaway success of molecular biology is<br>
entirely due to the amazing enzymes.  What much if not most of<br>
molecular biology is, with their gels and whatnot, are basically<br>
throwing enzymes at DNA, RNA.  DNA is just the code; it's the enzymes<br>
that are the machinery that make life work, and those machines are so<br>
sophisticated it makes me want to hurl every time I see the word<br>
"nanotechnology."  All the "telomerase" and other stuff you're hearing<br>
about: enzymes.  How many people even recognize the name?  Arthur<br>
Kornberg.  Did his Nobel-winning work in his late 30's.  (There are at<br>
least a half dozen other molecular biologists I'm not giving credit<br>
to.)<br>
<p>
	Hodgkin-Huxley: mathematical model for action potentials in<br>
the nerve.  It's the *only* successful neurocomputational model so far<br>
after all these decades, and the *only* successful mathematical model<br>
in biology (for which these two won their Nobel Prizes in).  Theirs<br>
was a lifetime of dedicated, painstaking research, and the model for<br>
what neurocomputation should aspire to be.<br>
<p>
	John Bardeen, the only man to have won two Nobel Prizes in<br>
physics, one for the transistor effect, the other for<br>
superconductivity.  Damn!  That's all I need to say about it.<br>
<p>
	Steve Smale and other less well-known mathematicians of chaos<br>
theory and differential equations (which is what the field used to be<br>
called before "nonlinear dynamics and chaos" became a big deal).<br>
There are at least two "schools" of dynamic systems, and Smale started<br>
on of them by tying topology to dynamics.  It is a very strange fact<br>
that MIT has, to the best of my knowledge, never offered a course in<br>
topological dynamics (!).  But then, the story of dynamics is still<br>
very wide open and much remains to be written...<br>
<p>
	I'll leave with one final topic: estimation, information,<br>
systems, dynamics, control, optimization, operations research.  These<br>
fields are so broad and diffuse and interrelated it's hard to<br>
appreciate them in their entirety.  Gauss in 1800's invented<br>
deterministic least squares.  Fisher in 1910's: invented maximum<br>
likelihood estimation.  Wineer in 1940's and for the rest of his life:<br>
Wiener filters, and other stuff that made its way into stochastics.<br>
Kalman in 1960's with the Kalman filter.  Kolmogorov in the '60's with<br>
a host of contributions to probability.  Shannon, of course, with<br>
information theory.  Lyapunov in the 19th century, and other work<br>
later in the '60s (LaSalle, Barbalat, others).  A lot of what made<br>
MIT's Course 6 "Area One" famous: the LQG (linear quadratic Gaussian)<br>
formulation which Athans and others are famous for, the canonical<br>
Oppenheim &amp; Willsky textbooks on signals and systems and Oppenheim's<br>
and Shafer's reference textbook on DSP, both of which needless to say,<br>
are enormous industrially.<br>
<p>
	It's difficult to estimate just how important these fields<br>
are, and therefore how to judge the contributions each of these men<br>
made to humanity.  I'll settle on only one example and quote from the<br>
at-times annoying Bart Kosko's _Fuzzy Thinking_ (fuzzy logic) book:<br>
<p>
	"Pound for pound and bit for bit the Kalman filter belongs<br>
with the light bulb and the radio and the microprocessor in its<br>
engineering benefits for mankind.  In many ways it goes beyond these<br>
since it is just a set of equations.  Like all math the Kalman filter<br>
is eternal...  Yet, most people have never heard of the Kalman filter.<br>
It guides airplanes and space probe and cruise missiles and tracks<br>
satellites and economic trends and changes in your bloodstream.  ...<br>
Did you ever wonder how a missile finds its target or how the<br>
astronauts find their way home?  The Kalman filter shows them<br>
how. ... Thousands of engineers have published small tweaks and<br>
variants of the Kalman filter."<br>
<p>
	No kidding!  I spent two summers ago running Matlab<br>
simulations on, yes guessed it, a Kalman filter.  Jordan (MIT's neural<br>
networks prof) has said similar things about the Kalman filter and<br>
system/information/control variants upon it: that it flies our<br>
airplanes including commercial jets, controls our robots and<br>
spacecraft, fine tunes the nuclear power plants and chemical<br>
engineering power plants, steers our ships, filters our satellite<br>
signals.<br>
<p>
	Most of Wall Street and almost all of the world's financial<br>
traffic is handled by computer algorithms, most of them in the spirit<br>
of the Kalman filter or recursive estimation in general.  If/when I<br>
become a machine intelligence, all my sensors will be run by Kalman<br>
filter-like control mechanisms.<br>
<p>
	The field of optimization and control makes me wonder at times<br>
if machine learning is what I should do instead of neurocomputation.<br>
I'm learning in my control class that in the last 10 years or so<br>
nonlinear adaptive control has really come into its own.<br>
<p>
	For example, robots can now do parameter estimation of their<br>
environment (say it wants to swing a bat optimally) that estimates 15<br>
or more parameters in &lt;0.1 seconds!  It picks up an object, and before<br>
it's moved it more than a centimeter, it's task-driven learning has<br>
managed to figure out all it needs to.  But this isn't that<br>
surprising: a military jetfighter has to fill such performance<br>
criteria as well.  Some of those jets would spontaneously explode if<br>
it weren't for sophisticated control mechanisms.<br>
<p>
	Keep in mind much of the linear or linearization work was done<br>
in the '60s, much of it at MIT.  This is not the sexiest of fields,<br>
but it's important work.  In case you didn't know, most of MIT's<br>
prestige is based upon the prominent position its electrical<br>
engineering, signal processing, and control department held after<br>
WWII.  Radar, and then the entire electrical engineering (and to a<br>
lesser extent aerospace) collaboration with the giant<br>
industrial-military complex.  Wiener's _Cybernetics_ was the most<br>
famous statement of MIT's theoretical contributions to these fields.<br>
_Cybernetics_: "Seminal books...comparable in ultimate importance<br>
to...Galileo or Malthus or Rousseau or Mill" (_New York Times_).<br>
<p>
	To show how unappreciated these fields are, Francis Crick<br>
recently published an journal article that he thinks the amplifier<br>
model might be really important for neurons, but the gain of our<br>
neural amplifiers must be low or otherwise we'd be going haywire.  The<br>
man has obviously not taken 6.003 -- he doesn't know the first thing<br>
about feedback control!<br>
<p>
CONCLUSION:<br>
<p>
	Anyhow, I kind of got sidetracked by my examples.  But back to<br>
motivations, ultimate goals.  I basically want to understand the<br>
universe, whatever is most fascinating, and I'm blessed/cursed enough<br>
to find a great many things really nifty.<br>
<p>
	But I am going to die, and it really forced me (and Jason) to<br>
think hard about this.  The Extropians pamphlet and whatever followed<br>
was an outcome of this angst.  It's taken me through a hell of a half<br>
year, but now I'm back to doing science.  Any why?  For a lot of<br>
reasons.<br>
<p>
	As for how ambitious I am, and as for the issue of pedagogy<br>
and how much it contributes to humanity, well, at the least, I will be<br>
a good professor.  If I'm no good at research, or if for some reason<br>
I'm disenchanted by science, I will write textbooks and maybe activist<br>
screeds as well.  It takes, what, 3 years to write a really good<br>
textbook?  Maybe up to 5 for the hardest fields.  Well, I've got a lot<br>
of years left in me before I kick the bucket.  :) I hope the<br>
biologists keep making breakthroughs in life extension.<br>
<p>
	But wait on that promise...textbooks are usually written by<br>
people in their 40's or later, and there's a reason for that.<br>
<p>
	Dammit, a third of my waking hours, I'm cursing myself out for<br>
being fucking slow or lazy.  But others went through the same thing...<br>
And some of them lived significant, excellent lives...so this shall<br>
content me, too.  :)<br>
