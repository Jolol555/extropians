<i>&gt; And if we should be worries about this ominous menace, what can we as </i><br>
<i>&gt; critical optimist do about it?</i><br>
<p>
How about learning enough basic facts about the structure and<br>
history if the net to understand why the possibility you raise<br>
is utterly ridiculous?  The way the net is built makes it not<br>
only unfeasible but technically impossible for anyone to have<br>
any overall control of the technologies used; in fact, diversity<br>
is a well-known security blanket.  Every node on the net--which<br>
connects to any number of other nodes any way it wants to, using<br>
any software that follows the standards, has 100% control of its<br>
own little piece of the net like a good decentralized system<br>
should, and they all know that being different from your neighbor<br>
is a good way to ensure the robustness of the system from<br>
attack.  So the more homogenized the system becomes, the greater<br>
the value of something different becomes solely for that fact<br>
alone.  Also, since the net--even a 100% Microsoft net--is used<br>
for sending big chunks of bytes to anyone who wants them, those<br>
chunks of bytes can be competing software that finds it easier<br>
and easier to compete as the network improves.<br>
<p>
Anyone who thinks Microsoft is a threat to the net is as far<br>
from reality as someone who thinks throwing away an aluminum can<br>
is a threat to the planet.<br>
