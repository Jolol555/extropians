This would be great in an ideal world.  But, look who is trying to sell<br>
the Chinese the infrastructure.<br>
It seems to be the same folks who have hugely vested interest in the<br>
status quo.  I only follow this subject<br>
in the detail provided by the likes of Business Week.  But, I believe<br>
this could be problematic; despite it<br>
being linear extropolation.  It certainly would be nice if it were not<br>
so.<br>
