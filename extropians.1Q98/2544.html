You might have to hurry, EuroMoon 2000 might be on its way! From the<br>
ESA press release (earlier posted on the transhumantech list):<br>
<p>
	The first step in this ESA initiated programme is a unique<br>
	project called 'Euromoon 2000' which is currently being<br>
	studied by ESA engineers/ scientists and key European Space<br>
	Industries.  The project is intended to celebrate Europe's<br>
	entry into the New Millennium; and to promote public awareness<br>
	and interest in science, technology and space exploration.<br>
	 <br>
	Euromoon 2000 has an innovative and ambitious implementation<br>
	plan.  This includes a 'partnership with industry' and a<br>
	financing scheme based on raising part of the mission's budget<br>
	from sponsorship through a dynamic public relations strategy<br>
	and marketing programme.<br>
	 <br>
	The mission begins in earnest with the small (approx. 100 kg)<br>
	LunarSat orbiter satellite, to be designed and built by 50<br>
	young scientists and engineers from across Europe.  Scheduled<br>
	for launch in 2000 as a secondary payload on a European Ariane<br>
	5 rocket, it will then orbit the Moon, mapping the planned<br>
	landing area in greater detail in preparation of the EuroMoon<br>
	Lander in 2001. The Lander's 40 kg payload allocation will<br>
	accommodate amongst others scientific instrumentation for<br>
	in-situ investigation of the unique site.  Elements of<br>
	specific support to the publicity and fund-raising campaign<br>
	will also be considered.<br>
	 <br>
	The Lander will aim for the 'Peak of Eternal Light' on the rim<br>
	of the 20 km-diameter, 3 km-deep Shackleton South Pole crater<br>
	- a site uniquely suited for establishing a future outpost.<br>
	This location enjoys almost continuous sunlight thus missions<br>
	can rely on solar power instead of bulky batteries or costly<br>
	and potentially hazardous nuclear power generation.  As a<br>
	consequence of the undulating South Pole terrain there are<br>
	also permanently shadowed areas - amongst the coldest in the<br>
	Solar System resulting in conditions highly favourable for the<br>
	formation of frozen volatiles (as suggested by the Clementine<br>
	mission in 1994).<br>
<p>
	The mission is particularly challenging because of the<br>
	required landing precision (within 100 m2) in terrain varying<br>
	between +6 km and -5 km in altitude.  Achieving the required<br>
	pinpoint touchdown capability would allow the future<br>
	exploitation of other interesting sites.  One such site is the<br>
	6 km-high Malapert Mountain, 120 km from the pole from which<br>
	the Earth can always be seen thus allowing continuous<br>
	communications with the home planet for any future outpost in<br>
	the region.  The 'Peak of Eternal Light' (described above) is<br>
	in direct view of Malapert, the twin peaks offer the<br>
	tantalising possibility of both of uninterrupted power and<br>
	communications.<br>
	 <br>
	Euromoon can be seen as be the initial step in founding the<br>
	first extraterrestrial outpost, founding the infrastructure<br>
	for a 'robotic village' controlled by a 'virtual community' of<br>
	Earth-based operators using telescience. This would indeed<br>
	mark the beginning of an expansion of the human domain beyond<br>
	Earth without the risk or cost of manned space travel.  This<br>
	concept also forms an essential element of the fund-raising<br>
	campaign which will create an exciting media opportunity<br>
	involving all levels of society.<br>
	 <br>
	Mission costs will be minimized by using existing hardware and<br>
	a rapid schedule. Industrial partners would share risk and<br>
	responsibility of realising the mission by forming the<br>
	EuroMoon Company.  A new marketing and advertising consortium<br>
	has been formed with the specific task of raising funds<br>
	through diverse commercial activities.<br>
	 <br>
	EuroMoon 2000 was chosen by ESA's Long-term Space Policy<br>
	Committee as the candidate for the Millennium Celebration and<br>
	presented to the Agency's Council in December 1997. A progress<br>
	report, as well as a programme proposal will be presented to<br>
	the March Council and a final decision is expected in June<br>
	next.<br>
 <br>
Note that if the poles are valuable real estate, the Peak is<br>
Boardwalk. Anybody who grabs it will be in a *very* good position. And<br>
it might be we euros who get there first - but the EEC bureaucracy<br>
might prevent that. It would be quite fun if somebody beat ESA to it.<br>
