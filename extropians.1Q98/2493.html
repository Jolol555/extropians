Gawd, what decade are you still in? Just how is it that the developed world is at<br>
fault for the starvation of children in countries which most of the time actually<br>
produce enough food to support the population, but hold back supplies from areas<br>
where dissident groups are based (as was the case in Ethiopia and Somalia, as is<br>
the case in Burma, as well as present day Indonesia) Hunger is a tool of third<br>
world despots, not of the first world citizenry who wind up footing the bill to<br>
feed the starving masses of other peoples basketcases.Spouting anti-western<br>
statist propaganda does not win any points in these debates. If anything, it is the<br>
fault of the authoritiarian states that produce such propaganda for their fifth<br>
column insurrectionists that the side effects of such brinksmanship even occur. Get<br>
off the statist treadmill.<br>
