Yes, but I doubt most of us would regard Gabapentin and other drugs<br>
against the above illnesses as very transhuman, They are just useful<br>
tools to live a healthy life, and cannabinoids would belong in that<br>
group of limited transhuman applications in this respect. What makes<br>
the cannabinoids more interesting is of course the mental effects, and<br>
the question of whether they can really be useful.<br>
<p>

<p>
True. But I think it might be a good idea to start with the<br>
cannabinoids themselves since they are less controversial - they do<br>
exist, they have objective, measurable effects and can be studied<br>
using the normal psychopharmacological methods. Given these data we<br>
can get a better knowledge of the potential.<br>
<p>

<p>
Definitely. And I usually have my best ideas in quite altered<br>
states. It is just that I do not need drugs to get there (thank<br>
Heisenberg for my personal mix of receptor protein genes! :-)<br>

Well, we european transhumanists have to meet somewhere, don't we? :-)<br>
