Glenn said something very interesting in one of those interviews. He was<br>
explaining why he was going up there, and said that they hoped to learn<br>
something about the aging process by sending into space someone who has<br>
already undergone much of the process. He said they might learn how to<br>
switch aging on and off. (I don't use quotes, because I'm not sure those<br>
are his exact words, but they are close.)<br>
<p>
Yet another sign that it's becoming acceptable to talk about dramatic life<br>
extension. Last night on ABC's 20/20, there was an excellent 15-20 report<br>
on the Geron advances. The presenters, far from attacking the idea, were<br>
clearly excited, delighted, and favorable. Barbara Walters looked stunned,<br>
and kept saying "amazing" and similar things, while Hugh Downs was looking<br>
forward to living well into a second century in good health.<br>
<p>
Some of the scientists quoted were talking about major life extension in<br>
five to ten years. I have major reservations about such an optimistic<br>
scenario (though I badly hope to be shown too pessimistic!). I think it was<br>
either Michael West or Michael Fossel (whose talk on telomerase I heard at<br>
the LA Gerontology Research Group meeting a few months ago) who made this<br>
claim. Has anyone read Fossel's book, and does his justify such an<br>
optimistic timescale?<br>
