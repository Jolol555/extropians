MEMS. (Micro electromechanical systems; mechanical systems -- as opposed<br>
to electronics -- that you can make using a chip fab.) Time scale: 1-5<br>
years; it's already working in the lab stage and commercial applications<br>
will be coming to a street near YOU real soon now. Impact: Not quite as<br>
big as nanotechnology, but grossly underestimated. (Imagine: your<br>
friendly neighbourhood police department has robot drones with high-<br>
definition low-light TV cameras so that it can fly round suspicious<br>
neighbourhoods looking for drug deals. Meanwhile, the drug dealers are<br>
tooling up with labs capable of producing etorphine by the milligram --<br>
that's all you need -- that fit in an innocuous-looking PCMCIA card in<br>
a laptop. And their guns shoot guided bullets. Oh, and did I mention<br>
the 20-watt turbogenerator a centimetre in diameter and two millimetres<br>
thick that ARPA is paying the development costs of?)<br>
<p>
This one seems to have blind-sided even the SF writers who went hog-wild<br>
over nanotech a decade ago, but it's real and it's here today the way<br>
personal computers were 'here today' in 1975.<br>
