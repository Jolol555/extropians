 <br>
<i>&gt; Anyone know the validity of the story that drinking seawater makes you crazy?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do people survive on a raft by drinking seawater, or do they have to catch</i><br>
<i>&gt; rainwater?  Maybe not drinking enough (sea)water makes them crazy?</i><br>
<p>
Seawater is significantly saltier than the water in human bodies.  <br>
Human urine is essentially as salty as the water in human bodies.  <br>
This means that if you drink seawater either you accumulate salt in <br>
your body, or you expel more water than you take in.<br>
<p>
And, in general, humans DON'T accumulate salt in their bodies when <br>
drinking seawater.<br>
<p>
So, drinking seawater, rather than quenching your thirst, causes you <br>
to become dehydrated.<br>
<p>
Also, salt water is a low-grade emetic (causes you to throw <br>
up).  This is an additional means by which drinking seawater can <br>
dehydrate you.<br>
<p>
Severely dehydrated individuals do show signs of dementia, including <br>
but not limited to hallucinations..<br>
