This would very cool indeed, but not this year, no. Unless that means to<br>
define 'hybrid' very losely. Biosensors? Coating AFM cantilevers with<br>
antibodies? Then we already can do such hybrids. <br>

I've been talking with a molbio-friend of mine (he's sequencing archae) <br>
about using near-field proximal probe optics on fluorescent-tag-nucleotide<br>
DNA polymerase reaction for sequencing purposes about a year ago. If we<br>
can tweak polymerases into yielding current-reaction information &amp; amplify<br>
it to macro scales, cheap palmtop DNA sequencers would become possible.<br>
Only a matter of time, this.<br>

<p>
I'd rather hope it will be electronic. (Photopolymerizable) (multi-layer) <br>
Langmuir-Blodgett- Si wafer coating of liquid-mosaic engineered proteins<br>
would seem the easiest route towards Si/molecular circuit hybrids. Most<br>
likely, we'll see memories as first-generation instances of such<br>
technology. <br>
