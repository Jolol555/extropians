<p>
So if one company has more money than the others, it should be<br>
allowed to charge less than cost for it's product? Doesn't this<br>
leads to a situation where, in order to compete in the short run,<br>
other companies are forced to do the same or lose customers?<br>
Wouldn't that just mean that the company with the most money to burn<br>
at the start of this cycle will probably last longest? And after the<br>
other competitors starve, the consumers are left with fewer choices<br>
in the long run. And that sucks - monocultures are prone to atrophy<br>
and catastrophic failure.<br>
<p>
Most "Americans" get all bent out of shape when businesses of<br>
another state (like Japan) try this trick on "us". Why should we<br>
allow it within our own market system?<br>
<p>
I'm not for excessive gubbamint regulation, but likewise, I wouldn't<br>
be in favor of any completely unregulated market scheme which didn't<br>
serve the ultimate interests of *individual humans* (ie consumers<br>
and business people, not just the few richest businesses). I believe<br>
that the goal of any market system should be to get the maximum<br>
sustainable level of individual economic freedom and power for<br>
*humans*, not corporations.<br>
<p>
I'd love to have you describe a method for avoiding this type of<br>
positive feedback trap without any type of regulatory intervention,<br>
and change my mind.<br>
<p>
tschau,<br>
