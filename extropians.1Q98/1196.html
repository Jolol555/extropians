 I see no reason to believe this. It is true that solving the protein<br>
folding problem would speed up nanotech development, but the protein<br>
folding problem appears to be at least as hard as producing a crude<br>
molecular assembler. Zyvex appears to have a serious approach to building<br>
an assembler that doesn't involve complex organics, and Bruce Smith and<br>
Markus Krummenacker have some well thought out plans about making an<br>
assembler from protein and dna that doesn't seem to require any software<br>
advances. (A company with good protein modeling software would be a<br>
good investment regardless of nanotech).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;there is a great deal of continuity in technological progress.  If you want</i><br>
<p>
 People who advocate nanotech without trying to understand the technical<br>
details tend to believe in unrealistic discontinuities. I don't think<br>
the technically minded nanotech enthusiasts make this mistake.<br>
