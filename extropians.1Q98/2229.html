I couldn't agree more: My post was simply an attempt to throw a little data at<br>
the discussion.  In particular, as I've written here before, my experience as<br>
a ship's agent and admiralty lawyer has given me an acute appreciation for the<br>
vulnerability of ships and other maritime engineering constructs to the<br>
"forces of wind and wave" (as the cliche of admiralty jurisprudence puts it),<br>
to say nothing of the acts of intentional aggression.  It is hard to imagine a<br>
more vulnerable position than lying afloat on the open seas.  A big boat is an<br>
easy, high-contrast target.  The term "sitting duck" comes to mind.  A fixed<br>
platform is obviously worse.<br>
<p>
However, as Admiral Rickover realized, a stealthy mobile submarine is a pretty<br>
good place to stash valuable assets.  Detection technologies right around the<br>
corner, though, may make this current fact obsolete.<br>
<p>
Beyond this, the only importance to the transhumanist agenda I can see to<br>
formation of terrestrial extra-national enclaves in the near term is the<br>
potential need of a secure base for research and development beyond the reach<br>
of current nation states who may attempt to ban key technologies.  IF (and<br>
it's a big "if") an offshore base were crucial for such work, then development<br>
of a terrestrial extra-national enclave could be important.  This would<br>
obviously be important only in a very brief transitional period, as getting<br>
such efforts off-planet would be a much, much safer course of action: The<br>
factors that made submarines important strategic technology in the 20th<br>
century will make spacecraft much more so in the next.<br>
