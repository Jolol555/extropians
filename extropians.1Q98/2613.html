Maybe you consider this question trivial, but how exactly do you know when<br>
the self begins to develop?  What does that mean and why does it grant<br>
rights?  Wouldn't you say that the crossing over of the chromosomes during<br>
meiosis of the ova (which occurs *before* contact with spermatazoa) is the<br>
beginning of self-development?  What about if a spermatazoa is partway into<br>
the ovum?  What if you abort an embryo that you know cannot develop past<br>
the size of a couple thousand cells, are you still killing a "developing<br>
self"?  It seems to me you're trying to convince list-members that an<br>
arbitary decision such as what defines human (and therefore what defines<br>
murder) is obvious and concrete(or at least the evolutionary advantages of<br>
a legal system that makes this decision is obvious and concrete).  I'm a<br>
little puzzled by your view, especially considering the logical nature of<br>
most of your other writings.<br>
<p>
I have one more question that might shed some light on your view:  Say you<br>
have an ovum that has just been fertilized... it has yet to divide.  It is<br>
also the perfect vehicle for cloning, so you to decide suck out the genetic<br>
material, and insert your own.(lets just assume that this can be done, I<br>
have a feeling it can)  Is this murder?<br>
