	I have thought about this a lot.  I think even a broader question is<br>
appropriate: when is right to intervene when you think someone is mentally<br>
ill?  Suicide is a subset of this case.  How do you know that this is not<br>
the direction your friend wishes to take?  Again, a difficult question.  I<br>
have come up with only one answer: each person needs to tell at least one<br>
other person those things that would signal for them "mental illness." <br>
Presumably, this would also include what exactly to do, including the<br>
possibility of temporarily limiting freedoms.  Maybe this can be made into<br>
a legal contract?  I'm not sure I would be totally averse to signing a<br>
contract that stated as soon as I try to commit suicide, stop me by any<br>
means!  It definitely beats the state deciding what defines mental illness<br>
for you.<br>
	Of course, there is one glaring problem: misinterpretation of the<br>
contract.  You'd have to be pretty specific about your symptoms of mental<br>
illness, and it would probably be prudent to revise the contract every once<br>
and a while.  For example, the statement "Through me in a straight-jacket<br>
if I ever move to Siberia" might need to be revised if global warming turns<br>
Siberia into a tropical paradise.<br>
