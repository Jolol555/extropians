In a message dated 98-03-27 07:47:33 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt; &gt;	Well, what do you think of NASA's announcement that they will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have an orbit which allows for Cydonia to be imaged? </i><br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;I think they'll either fail to get images of the 'face' and then the</i><br>
<i> &gt;face-fanatics will claim that it's a cover-up, or they'll get images</i><br>
<i> &gt;which show it's natural and the face-fanatics will claim they're fakes</i><br>
<i> &gt;or that careful analysis of single pixels shows that they're still</i><br>
<i> &gt;artificial.</i><br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;&gt; What do you</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; think the chances are of it being an artificial structure and why?</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Id think the face wasnt real if there wasnt a pyramid, i think pyramids are a<br>
little harder to produce naturally than a face, and the fact that the face is<br>
within walking distance of the pyramid... <br>
not only is there a pyramid, but supposedly there is are also 5 pyramids<br>
arranged in a pentagon, also in cydonia.<br>
when will cydonia be photographed?<br>
<p>
here is the original NASA photograph of the face and the pyramid in the same<br>
picture:  www.geocities.com/Area51/Vault/4698/viking.html   <br>
there are links from there to lots of other places, reports etc...<br>
