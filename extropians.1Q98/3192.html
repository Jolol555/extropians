Hello everybody! On the WTA action list we have been discussing an <br>
updated formulation of a set of transhumanist principles. The latest <br>
version is as follows. Comments and suggestions are welcome...<br>
<p>
------------<br>
Transhumanist Principles 2.1<br>
<p>
(1) Humanity will be radically changed by technology in the future. We<br>
foresee the feasibility of redesigning the human condition, including<br>
such parameters as the inevitability of ageing, limitations on human<br>
and artificial intellects, unchosen psychology, suffering, and our<br>
confinement to the planet earth.<br>
<p>
(2) Serious effort should put into understanding these coming<br>
developments and their long-term consequences.<br>
<p>
(3) Transhumanists believe that by being generally open and embracing<br>
of new technology we have a better chance of turning it to our<br>
advantage than if we try to ban or prohibit it.<br>
<p>
(4) Transhumanists advocate the moral right for those who so wish to<br>
use technology to extend their mental and physical capacities and to<br>
improve their control over nature. We seek personal growth beyond our<br>
current biological limitations.<br>
<p>
(5) In planning for the future, it is mandatory to take into account<br>
the prospect of dramatic technological progress. It would be tragic if<br>
the enormous potential benefits failed to materialize because of<br>
ill-motivated technophobia and unnecessary prohibitions. On the other<br>
hand, it would also be tragic if intelligent life went extinct because<br>
of some disaster or war involving advanced technologies.<br>
<p>
(6) We need to create forums where people can rationally debate what<br>
needs to be done, and a social order where responsible decisions can<br>
be implemented.<br>
<p>
(7) Transhumanists support scientific humanism. Though as a matter of<br>
fact most transhumanists believe in individual freedom, transhumanism<br>
in itself is politically neutral.<br>
