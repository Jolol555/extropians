Which ones? You said that untreated diabetes caused lots of road<br>
accidents, which should be impossible if the NHS was doing a good<br>
job of treating them. You also said that there was no health <br>
insurance market in the UK because of the NHS.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I was going on about is the problem that there's a conflict of</i><br>

<p>
Yes, but there's always a conflict of interest between people who<br>
want more money than they have, and people who don't want to pay.<br>
I don't see how this can ever be avoided.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That's not what I'm trying to do. Rather, I'm trying to point out </i><br>
<i>&gt;that free market systems are not very good at globally optimizing</i><br>

<p>
But we don't have anything like a free market in healthcare, so<br>
you can't claim that healthcare problems are free market failures.<br>
For all I know, if diabetics couldn't get cheap health insurance<br>
in a free market they would have got together and paid researchers<br>
to find a cure. That won't happen in a controlled market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The NHS _doesn't_ do it badly; it does it very well indeed, given</i><br>
<i>&gt;that it is grossly underfunded and massively oversubscribed.</i><br>
<p>
According to what I've heard/read/seen on TV from NHS doctors<br>
the NHS denies many treatments for those over seventy (sixty?), <br>
puts others on waiting lists which can last for years, and routinely<br>
lets people die to save money. Is this good healthcare?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(Compare</i><br>
<i>&gt;the situation with the USA, where per-capital healthcare spending</i><br>
<i>&gt;is 30-50% higher but something like 30% of the population have *no* </i><br>
<i>&gt;healthcare cover at all.)</i><br>
<p>
Do you really think that healthcare in the US is a free market? It's<br>
less government controlled than the UK, but that's all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The problem is, life is a 100% fatal</i><br>
<i>&gt;condition, and almost everyone will be willing to spend infinite</i><br>
<i>&gt;resources if they can stave it off for just one more minute;</i><br>
<p>
Yep, which is one major reason why healthcare costs in America are<br>
so much larger; when an NHS doctor would be allowing a patient to<br>
die, US doctors will continue expensive treatment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; faced</i><br>
<i>&gt;with that kind of demand, what sort of system _can_ allocate</i><br>
<i>&gt;resources fairly?</i><br>
<p>
A free market?<br>
