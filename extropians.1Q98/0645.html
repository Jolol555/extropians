<i>&gt;&gt; Most things in nature that work typically aren't promoted by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; medical establishment because they can't patent them, and therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; make multi-millions off of them.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; True, although you shouldn't make too much of this. Volz article</i><br>
<i>&gt; (below) says that hypericum extracts are among the most widely</i><br>
<i>&gt; prescribed antidepressants in Germany, and the Nordenfors article was</i><br>
<i>&gt; published in the journal of the swedish medical association. It seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; to me that this is more of an american problem than an international</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem.</i><br>
<p>
It's not true, and it's a dangerous meme that should set off propaganda<br>
alarms whenever you hear it.  European patent law is /stronger/ than<br>
US law, so if this "problem" of effective but non-patentable drugs<br>
really existed, it would exist more there than here.  The fact that it<br>
is in fact less shows how that assertion fails.<br>
<p>
Drug companies willingly spend millions of dollars investigating any<br>
natural substance that might have any remotely possible effect, and<br>
even if the effect occurs in the natural substance without refinement,<br>
they can still make the money back by selling refined versions that<br>
act faster or taste better or are more controllable.  If a well-known<br>
substance is not being sold and touted by drug companies, it's not<br>
because they can't patent it--it's because they've tested it and it<br>
doesn't work (or doesn't work as well as something else they make).<br>
Anyone who claims otherwise is just a charlatan trying to sell you<br>
snake oil.<br>
<p>
That said, there /is/ a problem in the US with drug companies not<br>
being able to rely upon perfectly valid studies not done by FDA rules<br>
(most of which have nothing at all to do with scientific validity).<br>
But even in that case, if a natural substance was better at something<br>
than the current drug of choice, drug companies would be falling all<br>
over themselves to test it and sell an extract.  The patent issue is<br>
nothing but a red herring.<br>
