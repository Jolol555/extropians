It actually goes a bit further than this. In 1996, somebody or other<br>
who nobody had ever heard of took out a trademark on Linux(TM), then wrote<br>
to various companies (SSC and Yggdrasil spring to mind) who make their<br>
living selling Linux books, distributions, or software demanding a pay-<br>
off for use of the name.<br>
<p>
With the approval of Linus Torvalds, and a pro bono attorney, SSC,<br>
Yggdrasil, Red Hat, and most of the other companies making money out <br>
of Linux started a lawsuit against the parasite, and tried to get<br>
the trademark invalidated.<br>
<p>
The outcome was that before the case came to court the opportunist<br>
folded, and the trademark was assigned (by mutual consent) to Linus<br>
Torvalds (who (a) invented Linux, and therefore deserves to hold it<br>
if anyone does, and (b) who has no intention of using it to make<br>
money).<br>
<p>
This is an interesting case insofar as it shows commercial entities<br>
_defending_ a common good (free access to the name "Linux"). The Linux<br>
industry, foetal though it might be at present, seems to have<br>
accomodated itself to the "bazaar" model of software development just<br>
when the rest of the computer industry is at the opposite extreme.<br>
Moreover, those companies -- even the most aggressively corporate<br>
ones, like Caldera -- are putting back freeware into the communal<br>
pot (RedHat's RPM system, Caldera's COAS and PPP code). They're treating<br>
their field as a positive-sum game, where cooperation results in greater<br>
growth than defection and it therefore pays dividends to give software<br>
away for free -- because, of course, the more Good Stuff there is in<br>
the free Linux systems, the more people will use it, and the more<br>
the businesses employing them will be inclined to pay for the commercial <br>
support packages aimed at businesses.<br>
