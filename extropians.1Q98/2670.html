<p>
Genetically, yes.  Identical twins have the same DNA as do clones.  Twins<br>
also grow in the same womb and are affected the same by the mother's<br>
nutrition and environment.  Clones developed in different wombs will have<br>
different environments.<br>
<p>
There is one theory, not tested as far as I know, that twins are not<br>
identical genetically.  This theory states that a minor mutation occurs<br>
early in the division.  The theory then postulates that the cells with<br>
different DNA split apart and form seperate individuals because their DNA<br>
don't recognize each other as the same body.  I heard this theory years ago<br>
and have had not heard of any followup with DNA tests to confirm it.<br>
<p>
I am an identical twin.  We shared the same placenta, and are mirror twins.<br>
Mirror twins occur when the blastula has already started to differentiate<br>
(and has a distinct left and right side) when it splits into two<br>
individuals.  Because of this, my brother is a mirror image with reverse<br>
internal organs.<br>
<p>
We were difficult to tell apart through high school, but now we look no<br>
more similar than we do with our older brother.  I tease him that I am the<br>
experimental rat on a vegetarian diet and taking life-extension drugs.  He<br>
is the control rat on a normal diet.  When we are older, we will compare to<br>
see how my life-extension theories are working.  I like to think I look<br>
younger than my brother, but I am not an unbiased observer.<br>
