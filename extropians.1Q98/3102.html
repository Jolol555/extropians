Well, don't all (western) justice systems work like that: the prosecution<br>
builds a case with evidence etc, and it's up to the lawyers to prove that<br>
this is crap and that in fact you're innocent. I really see no difference.<br>
The "presumed innocent until proven quilty" thing may sound o.k, but<br>
it's nonsense of course. If the servants of justice really thought you were<br>
innocent they wouldn't have arrested you in the first place, now would<br>
they? They don't call them "suspects" for nothing.<br>
