<i>        &gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Social darwinism is an old fashioned and foolish philosophy that         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;assumes morality can be obtained from nature.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Charlie Stross &lt;charlie@antipope.org&gt;:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;What do you prefer to use? </i><br>
<p>
I prefer to use my personal opinion and tell nature to go to hell. I don't <br>
believe in objective morality, but I do believe in subjective morality. Why <br>
do I like some things and dislike others? Because that's the way my brain is <br>
built.<br>
<p>
As I said, Darwin himself was not a social Darwinist, he was a very moral man <br>
but he lost his religious faith because he thought a God that sanctioned  <br>
a hideously cruel process like natural selection did not deserve worship.  <br>
He writes that he was very disturbed at the reproductive behavior of a <br>
species of wasp that he discovered as a young man. The wasp stings a spider <br>
enough to paralyze it but not enough to kill it, it then laid it's eggs on <br>
the poor beast. When the eggs hatch several days later the maggots slowly <br>
consume the still living creature, carefully  avoiding vital organs and <br>
leaving the brain for last.<br>
<p>
Darwin's best friend and vigorous defender Thomas Huxley in his essay  <br>
"Evolution and Ethics"  wrote that morality was objective, but could be found  <br>
by looking in the exact opposite direction from the dog eat dog would of <br>
nature. I wouldn't go as far as Huxley, but I don't think natural selection <br>
has a morality,  at least not a morality I want to follow, and if I ever meet <br>
you in a dark alley I hope you don't either. <br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me: </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt; The same argument could be made of cancer. If something is evil </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;then I'd rather it not be functional, rugged and competitive. </i><br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;you reject an old fashioned philosophical attempt to derive         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;morality from nature </i><br>
<p>
True, that's exactly what I did.                              <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;they you start pinning loaded terms like 'evil' on the administrative        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;donkey. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Actually, I pinned the word "evil" onto cancer, and I did so for only one   <br>
reason, I don't like it. Cancer is just not my cup of tea, if you disagree  <br>
that's fine, there is no disputing matters of taste.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;"government BAD,  free market GOOD". </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Explain that to diabetics who can't get reasonably priced medical        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;insurance cover</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
Reasonably priced? You mean explain why everybody can not always receive  <br>
medical benefits that are more expensive than the premiums they pay? I think <br>
it's sufficient to say that you can't get something for nothing. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It's in an insurance company's interest, and the interests of its         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;other customers, not to take on board individuals who are at high         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;risk. </i><br>
          <br>
Exactly. If diabetics pay less than they should then non diabetics will have <br>
to pay more. There is only one reason non diabetics would want to do that, <br>
they might want to be charitable. It's true that if nobody is in a charitable <br>
mood and if diabetics really can't afford their treatment then people are<br>
going to die, but how will government improve things? If I hate the idea of <br>
giving you money why would I vote for politicians to pass laws that make me?<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;diabetic hypoglycaemia is a not-too-uncommon cause of auto accidents.         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;One could prognosticate that it would be of indirect benefit to the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;users of a medical insurance company for it to offer cover for         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;diabetics, because presumably diabetics with adequate medical       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;supervision are less likely to let their condition get out of hand          </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and kill people (including users of our hypothetical insurance        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;company) while behind the wheel of a car.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It sounds like a pretty far fetched idea to me, but maybe. If you really <br>
believe in it and can convince others of the wisdom of your idea then start  <br>
your own insurance company. If you're right then you'll become very rich, <br>
I'm skeptical myself so I'll refrain from buying any of your stock, but I've  <br>
been wrong before and I wish you well on your endeavor.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The market is good at looking after local problems. It's complete         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;crap at predicting the future</i><br>
<p>
<p>
And politicians good at predicting the future?<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and it provides no solution to the tragedy of the commons without         </i><br>
        the imposition of an external regulator.<br>
<p>
<p>
The tragedy of the commons is just that, a tragedy, and unfortunately no <br>
system has a solution for it. There is no compelling reason why government <br>
should engage in projects that help most people most of the time, it's much <br>
more likely that they'd do things that help a very few people a lot but is<br>
slightly harmful to most. When the number of projects becomes large the harm <br>
is no longer slight.<br>
            <br>
Suppose I want to make $10,000,  there are two ways to go about it. I can <br>
work to repeal hundreds of special interest laws, each one costing me a few <br>
dollars, or I can lobby for the passage of one more special interest law that <br>
will give me and my friends $10,000 and cost everybody else a dollar or two. <br>
The second method makes much more sense, it's far easier to pass one law than <br>
to repeal hundreds .<br>
<p>
This sort of lobbying won't work in the free market. If I want an executive   <br>
at Microsoft to be promoted to a position of greater power there is only one  <br>
thing I can do to help that come about, purchase the product that the <br>
executive has been advocating. Bribery will help the executive's bank <br>
account but it will not help his chances for advancement, it will hurt it<br>
because his boss will note that his decisions have been poor and do not made <br>
economic sense.  The stockholders will note the same thing.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the role of government since the age of enlightenment -- the role         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that made it useful enough to have persisted as an institution </i><br>
<p>
<p>
And since that time "useful government" has created a sea of blood. It  <br>
mystifies me when people go on and on about how evil corporations are, <br>
yes Microsoft can be arrogant and yes, it makes me mad when Windows crashes <br>
too, but at least Bill Gates doesn't shove his customers into ovens.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Do away with governments that think they're there to enforce laws,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and you're left with the next level down:  gangsterism. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nobody on this list is advocating an absence of laws or enforcement only that <br>
government not have a monopoly on it.           <br>
