In that most ancient of nations, Japan, the stage is again set for<br>
humans who would push themselves to the utmost physical and mental<br>
ability, to set modern records for endurance and performance.  <br>
<p>
Onbashira and dohyoiri rituals harken back to the beginnings of<br>
history to cleanse the evil spirits and create the sacred space for<br>
competition primed by the latest in nutrition, fitness and<br>
technology.  The portals of the temple erected in the circle become<br>
the passage for television cameras and athletes clad in the most up<br>
to date equipment.<br>
<p>
The athletes march in groups defined by national boundaries, and <br>
the hopes of their home countries go with them.  Though each athlete <br>
wears the flag of his or her own country, once the torch is lit, the <br>
competition becomes athlete vs. athlete, athlete vs. individual <br>
limits, athlete vs. human limits.  Not every athlete will walk away <br>
with a medal, but who can say that any have failed?<br>
<p>
Bring on the hockey (and the popcorn!)<br>
