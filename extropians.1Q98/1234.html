It all sounds a little paranoid to me. On the other hand, I'm inclined<br>
to believe it because of another recent incident that bit me ...<br>
<p>
<p>
I'm a software guy: I don't care much about the underlying hardware as<br>
long as it works. I spent many years messing with Macs, then switched back<br>
to PCs running UNIX or Linux. About this time last year, I bought a PC<br>
as a workstation. Pentium 133 processor, VX motherboard ... pretty vanilla<br>
sounding, except for the 64Mb of RAM and the fast SCSI bus. (Why do<br>
commercial PCs always have crap peripherals and too little memory?) Anyway,<br>
this month it's due for its mid-life refit: I want to upgrade it to<br>
128Mb of RAM (all I can put in it without ditching my old SIMMs or buying<br>
a new motherboard) and a faster CPU. This should be straightforward, right?<br>
<p>
Wrong.<br>
<p>
Middle of last year, Intel introduced their MMX nonsense -- basically<br>
games accelerators. No use to man, beast, nor Linux hacker. But it<br>
turns out now (when I finally pay attention to the hardware market)<br>
that the MMX Pentia are _not_ pin-compatible with the old ones; nor<br>
do Intel make any non-MMX chips these days. No, I need a new motherboard --<br>
also containing an Intel chipset!  (Or a second-hand 200Mhz Pentium 1, <br>
but they're as rare as hen's teeth.) Moreover, the new motherboards<br>
only have 2 SIMM sockets (they're trying to move people forward to the<br>
newer memory formats), so I wouldn't be able to upgrade my memory at<br>
the same time. Or I could pay through the nose for an Intel overdrive<br>
chip ...<br>
<p>
Why do I feel as if I'm being whipsawed by Intel? Their CPUs are <br>
supposeduly instruction-set compatible all the way back to the 4004,<br>
but in real terms they want the users on a continual upgrade treadmill<br>
just as badly as Microsoft do.<br>
<p>
Methinks I'm going in search of a second-hand pentium chip. And my<br>
next PC will contain NO components made by Intel and NO software by<br>
Microsoft.<br>
