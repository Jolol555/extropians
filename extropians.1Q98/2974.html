I'm not the original poster, and hence I don't feel the need to prove<br>

there are few significant non-economic side effects to such a welfare<br>
state.  I'm anti-welfare myself, but I fully admit that there are other<br>
areas where the US could cut back on it's expenditures without<br>
sacrificing welfare.  To this end I'm interested in hearing your ideas,<br>
but you'll have to work hard to convince me:  I've lived amongst "white<br>
trash" all or most of my life, much of it in my own family, and I've<br>
seen the bullshit behind the "product of society" or government<br>
oppression excuses;  many of those I've known would probably have been<br>
driven to acquire marketable skills if they hadn't seen their older<br>
siblings and parents mooching off the government and even each other.<br>
I'm sure a similar "slacker" mentality prevails in many of the countries<br>
you champion, but I'll leave that to you to refute.<br>
<p>
The fact that a welfare<br>
system is impossible to implement in the US without all kinds of bad<br>
side-effects only tells us something about US-society.<br>
<p>
I guess it does, but is what it tells us such a bad thing?<br>
<p>
The _fact_ that<br>
there are countries in this world that have the combination of a very<br>
healty economy and a extensive welfare system shows that it is possible,<br>
<p>
given competent leadership, organisation and a sense mutual<br>
responsibility.<br>
<p>
Maybe so, but what's the point?  I'm all for cutting down on the amount<br>
of wasted resources the US exploits each year, but I think the saved<br>
resources would be better suited toward technological growth, better<br>
education and assisting small businesses- people who actually have<br>
ambitions but lack the means to realize them.  I'm afraid I'm just not<br>
convinced that the welfare system encourages people to get back on their<br>
feet again.  Socialists/communists are always citing the "demoralizing"<br>
effect having to sell one's labor has on a man, but where do they expect<br>
the resources and labor that feed the unemployed to come from if not<br>
from their more productive fellow citizens?  Would you consider yourself<br>
a socialist, and if so how do you fit that economic vision into<br>
extropian ideals?  I'm interested in hearing your feedback on this.<br>
