<i>&gt; Got news for ya: government is inherently adversarial - if it weren't,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it wouldn't need force.  If you're serious about "eliminating the `them</i><br>
<i>&gt; vs. us' syndrome", concentrate on voluntary action *outside* the domain</i><br>
<i>&gt; where every action is a defeat for somebody.</i><br>
<p>
AMG:<br>
<i>&gt; Is it possible that the force that government occasionally uses</i><br>
<p>
Occasionally?  What is government, if not the threat of force?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; is due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the lack of participation by those effected by lack of fair and equitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; representation? Is it possible that the system is so non-representative --</i><br>
<i>&gt; and becoming increasingly so -- because of the constraints imposed on</i><br>
<i>&gt; those selected to be our representatives by monied special interests?</i><br>
<p>
Do I detect a hint there of a faith that *further* narrowing the <br>
field of candidates able to campaign effectively, as every "campaign <br>
finance reform" has done, will *increase* participation?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is it possible that increased, and improved education with a stronger</i><br>
<i>&gt; focus on scientific method, critical reasoning,emphasizing independent</i><br>
<i>&gt; and skeptical thinking might result in a small first step towards</i><br>
<i>&gt; eliminating the "them vs. us" syndrome? Is it possible that increased</i><br>
<i>&gt; involvement by those many people who feel disenfranchised, frustrated</i><br>
<i>&gt; and disgusted by the the present system might, through their activism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; help the present system evolve?</i><br>
<p>
Not so long as the system is built on coercion in the name of a majority.<br>
<p>
Where there is true agreement, there's no need of force (or the threat<br>
of force).  But because people are different, you'll never get everyone<br>
to agree on everything, unless it's to leave each other to enjoy (or<br>
suffer) their respective choices in peace.<br>
<p>
It's tempting to imagine that if people were smarter, more rational,<br>
more honest, more conscious of the general good and more able (and<br>
willing) to put their narrow interests aside, then there need never <br>
be another disagreement, because Truth would necessarily be recognized <br>
by all.  The last century's developments in mathematics (not to mention<br>
physics) suggest otherwise, but suppose it's true; FIRST you have to <br>
choose a way to reform the schools, and lotsa luck getting agreement<br>
on that!<br>
<p>
Why pour good wine into a sewer?  (You don't get a better grade of sewage.)  <br>
Where coercion is legitimized, there is and will always be <br>
a magnet for corruption.  <br>
Apply your ingenuity instead to build a new kind of institution.<br>
