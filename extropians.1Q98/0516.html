The theory that telomeres are the clock that tells a cell when to age and die <br>
may have some truth in it, but the idea has not aged very well in the last few <br>
months. However it doesn't really matter because whatever the aging clock is <br>
cloning must have reset it, at least to some degree. Dolly came from an adult <br>
cell and in the normal course of events this cell would only be able to <br>
reproduce a few more times, but Dolly must have exceeded this limit many <br>
times over, and done it when she and was still growing in the womb with her <br>
cells reproducing at a frantic rate. <br>
<p>
She looks perfectly healthy but we won't know for sure if the clock was fully <br>
reset until we watch her for several more years and see how she ages. It will <br>
also be interesting to observe her offspring. My bet is that she is normal <br>
in every way, time will tell.<br>
