<i>&gt; Anders, later:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt; The problem with drug experiences (or for that</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter a lot of our subjective experiences) is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are highly unreliable - how much of the effects</i><br>
<i>&gt; are real, and how much is just delusion? &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is it delusion, or merely annecdotal, when certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; affects are replicated time after time over many</i><br>
<i>&gt; years of trials, under many different environmental</i><br>
<i>&gt; conditions, especially when the subject has</i><br>
<i>&gt; attempted, with varying levels of success, to achieve</i><br>
<i>&gt; this affect with other substances and methods?</i><br>
<p>
That sounds like anecdotal evidence unless it has been carefully<br>
collected and analysed. I don't trust individual reports like the<br>
above, since they are heavily biased in a lot of directions - most of<br>
the reports are made by people who are convinced about beneficial<br>
effects, each case is completely different from the others, there are<br>
plenty of confunding variables etc. There are a lot of areas where you<br>
could make the same claim, like the danger of swimming shortly after<br>
eating (there is no real danger, but try telling that to a mother) or<br>
the dangers of electromagnetic fields (where the real dangers appear<br>
to be rather diffuse). I prefer more careful studies, even if the<br>
anecdotal evidence may sound convincing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps the more serious delusion is the belief that</i><br>
<i>&gt; useful information can be obtained primarily by</i><br>
<i>&gt; chemical studies of the effects of a single substance</i><br>
<i>&gt; without sufficient regard to the "set and setting"</i><br>
<i>&gt; influences that Michael mentions.</i><br>
<p>
The goal IMHO should be drugs that are as independent of set and<br>
setting as possible - they should work even if you don't believe in<br>
them. Sure, set and setting can build a lot on this, but without a<br>
strong pharmacological basis you could as well eat sugar pills and use<br>
the placebo constructively.<br>
