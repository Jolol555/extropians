I browsed your website for a while and liked it. I am a fellow <br>
webmaster myself (although I play an attorney by day) ;-) . I was <br>
wondering if you would link your site to ours?<br>
<p>
I have carefully assembled more than 340+ legal related search <br>
engines onto our site into a "gigantic" metaindex search tool. These <br>
are not just links to the search engines but the actual search forms <br>
for each engine. It is a great tool for legal research allowing you to <br>
access for free much of what major commercial service still charge lots <br>
of money for.<br>
<p>
Our listTool - Mailing and Discussion List Manager makes the process <br>
of subscribing, unsubscribing and sending commands to over 500+ <br>
mailing and discussion lists easy. Enter your email address, select the <br>
mailing list, pick the command and press the "Send Command to List" <br>
button and our software will do the rest.  Users can also search our <br>
database of thousands of legal questions and answers or post a free <br>
question to our network of 190+ attorneys across the United States.<br>
Attorneys can join the network for free.<br>
<p>
If you do wish to link to us the url for our Home Page is: <br>
<a href="http://www.lawguru.com/">http://www.lawguru.com/</a> . The url for the Legal Research page is: <br>
<a href="http://www.lawguru.com/search/lawsearch.html">http://www.lawguru.com/search/lawsearch.html</a> although a link to the <br>
Home Page is always preferred. <br>
<p>
Please let me know if you do link to us. I really appreciate it.<br>

Attorney at Law<br>
