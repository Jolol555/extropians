<i>        &gt;The human eye contains, in effect, two different imaging systems:         </i><br>

      <br>
True.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The rest of the retina combined has about the same number of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;photoreceptive cells, and covers a much wider field; it's less        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;sensitive to colour, much lower resolution, but is functional in         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;very low light levels.</i><br>
               <br>
<p>
Light sensitivity is irrelevant, we're talking about the amount of information <br>
that the brain gets from an eye in normal operating conditions. Peripheral <br>
vision is good for spotting motion, but it doesn't take much information to <br>
alert the brain of something of interest so it can turn the eye and the fovea<br>
can get a good look at it.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I think there are some figures for visual data sensitivity in Foley, </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Van Damm et al, but it's a while since I had to read that (read: </i><br>
<i>        &gt;since I last had anything to do with real-time photorealistic </i><br>
<i>        &gt;rendering for simulator graphics engines). About 4kx4k pixels </i><br>
<i>        &gt;springs to mind ...</i><br>
<p>
               <br>
That would mean we could distinguish between 16 million objects without <br>
moving our eye at all! The letter "l" in "resolution" just does not seem to <br>
me to be made of 16 million parts, something is not right. Even in the <br>
unlikely event that the fovea was capable of such a prodigious feat, I doubt  <br>
it could transmit the description, and even if it could the brain is <br>
certainly not able to handle such a glut of information.<br>
