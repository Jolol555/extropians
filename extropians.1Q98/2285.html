Not true. :)  Radiation pressure is not a significant compressant<br>
of the fusion fuel, though this was an interesting false lead for<br>
the journalist who almost went to jail (and whose name I cannot<br>
remember).  A dense plastic foam (sorta like styrofoam) is <br>
packed around the fusion fuel, and vaporized in a very short time<br>
by the x-ray pulse from the fission device.  It is the exploding<br>
foam that compresses the fusion fuel.  There is a thick cap of<br>
U-238 between the fission device and the fusion fuel, precisely<br>
to *prevent* the radiation from hitting the fusion fuel directly <br>
before compression can occur.<br>
