<i>&gt; From: "Alexander 'Sasha' Chislenko" &lt;sasha1@netcom.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;It may be useful to start a community of stateless persons - a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;global "phyle" that would protect your interests and supply you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;with some information - in exchange for financial or other</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;contributions.  What would be a good name for it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Mr Lee's Greater Hong Kong.......  ;)</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;There's a better example in his "Diamond Age" but I forget what</i><br>
<i>&gt;they were called....</i><br>
<p>
Funny you should mention  "The Diamond Age", I have it at my elbow<br>
(re-reading) Are you refering to the neo-Victorians, the Ashanti,or<br>
one of the many other "Phyles" mentioned.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's an example which has often appealed to me, but the problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;lies in having your phyle (what is the origin of this term, BTW?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;defend your widely dispersed interests in territory owned by</i><br>
<i>&gt;others. How does the cavalry get past the border patrol to rescue</i><br>
<i>&gt;you?</i><br>
<p>
I don't recall what phyle is short for, if I remember I'll let you<br>
know. If you recall from the book our skull gun packing friend Bud<br>
assaulted a member of the Ashanti (who were a tribe and not just a<br>
phyle) as a result of which a large team of Ashanti flew in and<br>
searched out the perpetrator, and placed him under "personnel<br>
arrest". They immediately sought out the proper authorities and you<br>
recall the rest. (no spoiler here) This is one possibility.<br>
<p>
Nicely done I might add.<br>
