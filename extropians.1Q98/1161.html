Uh, Thatcher was a hell of a long way from a libertarian; she raised taxes<br>
while claiming to reduce them, increased government centralisation while<br>
claiming to want to reduce government power, not to mention railroading the<br>
'Ugly Guns Ban' of 1988 through Parliament. While she was able to take<br>
an economic basket-case and turn it into a reasonably functioning economy,<br>
so did Hitler.<br>
<p>
So certainly more libertarian than Callaghan or Tony Benn, but nowhere near<br>
as libertarian as many nineteenth century politicians.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; until she resigned.</i><br>
<p>
I thought Major was voted in to replace her.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(Clue: the whole world doesn't work the same way as your back yard, or mine.)</i><br>
<p>
Yes it does; the people who were burning her effigy were the ones who<br>
were no longer able to skive off at work or live off my taxes, the<br>
same kind of people who have been protesting in France and other<br>
socialist nations. America just hasn't yet gone as far down the socialist<br>
road, so there's less resistance from those outside the government who<br>
benefit from legitimized theft.<br>
<p>
And if the people really disliked her that much, why did 40-45% of them <br>
keep voting for her?<br>
