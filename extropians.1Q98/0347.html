I support human cloning, but these quotes by Seed bother me:<br>
<p>
eyehi quoting AOL article quoting The Associated Press quoting Seed:<br>
<i>&gt; Seed acknowledged he is unsure if he can accomplish his goal, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; genetics researchers questioned whether human cloning is yet</i><br>
<i>&gt; technologically possible.</i><br>
[....]<br>
<i>&gt; Seed, who says he has a doctorate in physics from Harvard but is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; affiliated with any institution,</i><br>
[....]<br>
<i>&gt; Seed said earlier he hoped that within 1 1/2 years he would produce a</i><br>
<i>&gt; pregnancy capable of lasting at least two months.</i><br>
<p>
Seed is not sure this will work.  Seed's area of expertise is not<br>
medicine or biology.  He has not previously been involved in any cloning<br>
research.  And what does that last statement mean?  Does it mean that<br>
his clones can't even last through a complete pregnancy to a live birth?<br>
That doesn't sound like a very viable clone to me.<br>
