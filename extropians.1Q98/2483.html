<p>
<p>
Most experts put the human limit for resolving audio in the 20 to 24-bit<br>
range.  Even ultra high-end studio equipment does not exceed 24-bits because<br>
there is no practical reason to.  <br>
<p>
Also, having 20-bit converters in a car stereo is a total waste.  You need a<br>
minimum of 1500 cubic feet (rule of thumb) of enclosed space to reproduce a<br>
sound without it being seriously colored and distorted by the enclosing<br>
space.  While the sound may be *generated* with high precision, the human<br>
perception of the sound will be very colored and inaccurate due to the small<br>
environment creating a very uneven frequency response.  A good 16-bit<br>
converter is more than enough for any vehicle.  It never ceases to amaze me<br>
that so many self-styled car audiophiles know so little about the<br>
fundamentals of audio reproduction.  The environment has far more to do with<br>
the quality of the audio than the quality of the electronics generating it,<br>
esp. considering the average quality of audio electronics these days.  The<br>
quality of the electronics only starts to become very important when your<br>
sound-space becomes relatively large i.e. much larger than the enclosed<br>
space of your car.<br>

<p>
Well, it wasn't really the topic I was on, but most of my experience with<br>
the topic did come from a lot of work in the audio field.<br>
