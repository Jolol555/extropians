<i>&gt; What irritates me the most about this situation is that this whole </i><br>
<i>&gt; story is only in the allegation stage, with absolutely no proof other </i><br>
<i>&gt; than this story from an ex-intern who may or may not have made up the </i><br>
<i>&gt; whole thing to impress her coworkers. </i><br>
<p>
There *is* a quite a bit of circumstantial evidence (which, despite <br>
what Perry Mason will tell you, is often the most important and <br>
accurate).  These points have either been admitted or have <br>
documentary proof:<br>
<p>
1.  Vernon Jordan, the President's right hand man and First Pal, <br>
was active in finding her a job outside the White House before the <br>
last election.<br>
<p>
2.  She was visiting the White House and receiving phone calls from <br>
it as late as last month.<br>
<p>
3.  She was receiving packages from the White House by courier.<br>
<p>
This is extremely unusual for a White House intern, who is at the <br>
*bottom* of the totem pole, who might catch a glimpse of the <br>
President 2 or 3 times in the entire time, and who are specifically <br>
ordered to stay away from the President if they do see him. <br>
<p>
Now this all just suggests that she and the President were having <br>
an affair, and I will join the chorus of those who don't give a damn <br>
what he does with his wing-wang, but it does also lend the woman <br>
more credibility in her statements.<br>
