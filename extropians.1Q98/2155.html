The gradual slide in quality at _Scientific American_ has much to <br>
do with its decline in readership, increased competition from cutting <br>
edge technology publications, and the proliferation of online sources <br>
of information.  It survives by virtue of its past reputation for <br>
providing both scientific information and commentary, a combination <br>
that has not yet been achieved in other sources.  <br>
<p>
The general American's  interest in science stems from the<br>
perspective of 'how does this affect my life, or my family's<br>
life?'--thus the emphasis on editorial essays.  I see a strong<br>
opportunity here for someone in ExI to write a compelling essay for<br>
_Scientific American_ that relates our optimistic perspective on new<br>
scientific developments.  Or at least a few letters to the<br>
Editor--people do read them!  Editors are beginning to pay attention <br>
to us--I've got a few sniffing around my stuff, if I can get some of <br>
it out the door in reasonable fashion--let's give them something to <br>
chew on!<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
