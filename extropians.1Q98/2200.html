There is of course an extraordinary amount of technophobic and mystical<br>
muck churning out of Hollywood and its analogs, and yet I've been thinking<br>
lately that Robert Zemeckis may take the cake as the most conspicuously<br>
anti-extropic film-maker out there these days.  You could make a case for<br>
saying "Back to the Future" was reasonably extropic (despite its major<br>
dreck factor) with its whole self-responsibility message, but the latest<br>
three films all strike me as curiously and actually *insistently*<br>
anti-extropian in their themes.  In "Death Becomes Her" Zemeckis exposes<br>
a group of immortalists as grotesques, and expresses the theme that death<br>
is a kind of blessing rather than a curse.  In "Forrest Gump" he suggests<br>
that simple values are adequate to a misleadingly overcomplicated world<br>
(interesting characters who actually make difficult choices in the face of<br>
real complexities are killed off).  In "Contact" he urges that science and<br>
faith are more or less equivalent.  Of course, Isabella Rosellini is so<br>
fabulous as an immortalist in "Death Becomes Her" that she nearly steals<br>
the show away from the deathist fest it amounts to, just as Jodie Foster's<br>
Dr. Arroway (sp?) is so luminously moral that the film seems as much an<br>
indictment of mysticism if you squint when you watch it as it is a<br>
eulogy for secularism by apparent intention.  It is because Zemeckis<br>
zeroes in on real extropian values and issues before he subverts them that<br>
makes his films seem more dire than the run of the mill technophobia out<br>
there.  Thoughts?  Best, Dale    <br>
