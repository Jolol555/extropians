<i>&gt; I've played around with a animated planner, and with a 3D chart</i><br>

<i>&gt; on the degree of likelyhood, importance, field, applications, etc. It </i><br>
<i>&gt; gives a more "gut' feel for progress than a 2D chart.</i><br>
<p>
This sounds like great fun! What program was it?<br>
<p>
(Hmm, might be a fun java applet for a transhuman website, a sketch of<br>
possible future developments. Now link it to the Foresight<br>
Exchange...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;What I would like is a molecular film that acts as a cellular</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;automaton. Maybe we could use the microtubule units?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What for?</i><br>
<p>
Fun. Aesthethics. I like CAs :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How small a unit cell? How many (how few, actually)? </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is there a market for this that cannot be filled with projected</i><br>
<i>&gt; Si 'von Neumann' chips?</i><br>
<p>
It would likely be significantly faster and denser than the chips. And<br>
if we could tune the transition rules, then we could get lattice gas<br>
dynamics with a wonderful resolution, or make universal computations<br>
for real. Or just run the greatest Game of Life ever.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What good is a microtubule? It has to be in water, no?</i><br>
<p>
I think so. Normally the units form a cylinder, with a helical tiling<br>
of the subunits (and some interesting stability properties; they are<br>
dynamical structures, constantly being formed and dissolved at the<br>
ends). The fun thing is that it is possible that the units flip<br>
around, acting as a cellular automaton which can have all sorts of<br>
dynamics. If this is used for the transport proteins (dyneins and<br>
kinesines) that move vesicles along the microtubule is anybody's<br>
guess. I really understand why some think microtubulu are "magical",<br>
they are extremely subtle self-organized structures.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Any other ideas for thin-film, nearly nanotech products?</i><br>
<p>
What about using reaction-diffusion dynamics to create complex local<br>
strucures? That might be useful to maximizing catalytic efficiency,<br>
adapting to changes in the environment or changing color.<br>
