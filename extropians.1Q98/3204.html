<i>&gt; From:          Arjen Kamphuis &lt;mountain@knoware.nl&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I also read somewhere (but have not been able to confirm it) that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; GPS-navigation satellites will 'run out of dates' by the end of _this_</i><br>
<i>&gt; year. It seems their calender is based on counting weeks since 1-1-1980 and</i><br>
<i>&gt; by next september or something they will run out of memory. Can anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; confirm this story?</i><br>
<p>
I haven't heard it, but let's do some credibility analysis.<br>
<p>
First analysis: is this way of tracking dates viable?  It seems to me <br>
that a GPS satellite would need a great deal higher precision than <br>
this.  If they used off-the-shelf date hardware of the sort routinely <br>
used in PCs, then some GPS satellites may have a <br>
year-2000 problem and some won't.<br>
<p>
Second analysis: does this way of tracking dates lead to the <br>
predicted effect?  For convenience round to 50 weeks per year.  A <br>
one-byte week number would provide 5 years; this system, with 1980 as <br>
the base, would run out of dates in late 1984, not 1998.  A two-byte <br>
week number would provide nearly 25 years, and run out of dates <br>
sometime in 2004, not 1998.  A three- or four-byte week number would <br>
throw the die-off so far out in the future that the satellites will <br>
be replaced before then anyway.<br>
<p>
So the story as stated is clearly not credible.<br>
<p>
(Caveat: sometimes *reality* is not credible.)<br>
