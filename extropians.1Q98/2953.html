<i>&gt;Still, Erik's previous claim, that the biggest medieval ship (about 200</i><br>
<i>&gt;tons, was it?) would not be allowed in a Roman harbor, is invalidated.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The biggest Scandinavian ship was, according to "Aspects of Maritime<br>
Scandinavia" (1991) 155 tons in cargo size.  The biggest Venecian ships, of<br>
the 14th to 15th century (end of MA, beginning Renaissance) was 200 to 300<br>
tons in cargo size [1].<br>
<p>
My memory was a bit wrong, the biggest ships that were allowed to enter the<br>
harbour were 134 tons in size (not 150 as I stated). See my post on this:<br>

<p>
Cargo ships of more than 1200 net tonnage (the size of the Roman ISIS, of<br>
which type at least 60 to 80 ships existed, because of the high wheat<br>
requirements of the empire, however, it was probably much more) were only<br>
built again in 1800 (!) in larger series [2].<br>
<p>
Nelson's "Victory" had 3000 brutto register tons, the ISIS had 2900 BRT.<br>
<p>
Conclusion: The biggest Scandinavian ships would barely have been allowed to<br>
enter the Roman harbour, and the *biggest* late MA / early Renaissance<br>
Venecian ships were still under the *average* Roman size.<br>
