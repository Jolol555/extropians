Your first mistake was using a "conspiracy theory" book as your sole<br>
historical reference.  Not only are your examples way out of context, but<br>
irrelevant.  Bell Helicopter was *the* vendor of helicopters to the<br>
military *long* before the Vietnam (First delivery to the military in<br>
1946).  Additionally, Bell was  one of the most prominent developers of new<br>
aerospace technologies from WWII through the Vietnam War (first American<br>
jet powered aircraft, first aircraft to break the sound barrier, *the*<br>
leader in helicopter technology, etc) and received numerous military<br>
contracts during the time period prior to the Vietnam war.  The founder of<br>
Bell (Larry Bell?) died circa 1956, at which point the essentially<br>
leaderless company became more or less for sale until they were finally<br>
bought by Textron in 1960.  First National Bank had very little to do with<br>
promoting a company who at the time was already considered to be the leader<br>
in military helicopter technology.<br>
<p>
Boeing is an even stupider example, which I'll get to in a moment.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; To blame "Businessmen" for wars, you must ignore the fact that MOST</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of them, on either side, LOSE money in wartime.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't ignore it, it's true. But the really big enterprises, of course</i><br>
<i>&gt;especially arms industry, usually profit from war -- and the big banks behind</i><br>
<i>&gt;them do as well.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You shot yourself in the foot here.  Boeing nearly went *bankrupt* after<br>
WWII, as production of wartime products effectively stopped.  Boeing bet<br>
the entire company on the 707 whiched was successful enough to keep the<br>
company going.<br>
<p>
The huge profit increases from '65-'70 correspond to the wildly successful<br>
sales of the Boeing 727 (starting in 1964) and the best-selling commercial<br>
aircraft ever, the 737, which became an instant success when introduced in<br>
1967.  The large profit increases you noted were in no way related to war<br>
time efforts, but in the commercial sector instead.<br>
  <br>
I *seriously* suggest that you take the time to research your evidence<br>
prior to puking this crap all over the mailing list.  By citing your sole<br>
source as a conspiracy novel, you make yourself look like even more of an<br>
idiot.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; : Who profits from a tax policy which burdens the majority and favours</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : the minority? The minority, of course. Which is not the government.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Hah!  Government is the most favored minority of all!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In which way?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : John Clark, one of the more intelligent free market advisors, would</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : answer: "If you remove governments, all this corruption will disappear</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : and the free market will bring up only efficient companies." The problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : is that by removing government, you only remove a cover under which the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : true power elite hides. The power structures remain - and before you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : say "Jebediah", your country will be ruled directly by big enterprises.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Evidence?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For the power structures, there's lots of evidence. US history is full of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Start with JFK, go over to Vietnam, look at Watergate, look at how Reagan was</i><br>
<i>&gt;put up as a strawman for Bush and how Bush (former CIA-boss, coming from a</i><br>
<i>&gt;rich family, good connections to investment banks, big in the oil industry</i><br>
<i>&gt;with Zapata Oil), how Bush started the Gulf War etc. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Rich families are always in the top political positions because it is very<br>
expensive to be a politician.  This is true even in the most socialist<br>
countries.  But it is a good investment for rich people because the<br>
government is an advantageous source of power that they can control.  A<br>
source of power that wouldn't exist on the free market.  Take away this<br>
unfair advantage and they have to compete based on their virtues, just like<br>
everyone else.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;For what happens after you remove the cover: The fact that nothing you call a</i><br>
<i>&gt;free market has ever existed. And the above facts.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well duh.  That's the whole point.  A free market economy has never been<br>
tried in any significant sense because government always gets in the way.<br>
Do you think the government wants a free market?  Come to Silicon Valley<br>
sometime and ask your average independant consultant.  Even a "pseudo-free<br>
market" like the Internet scares the hell out of government because it<br>
devalues their power structures.  But hey, they're in a postion to<br>
legislate that nuisance away...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; If you're right, wouldn't it be better in some ways to have the beast</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; made naked, so all can see its true nature?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your rhetoric doesn't help here. Major parts of the population are controlled</i><br>
<i>&gt;through mass media, unless anyone shows them a "beast" on TV, they won't</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe in it. People in the Middle Ages (another fine Free Market) followed</i><br>
<i>&gt;the church. This is an example of direct influence through a true power elite</i><br>
<i>&gt;and of what people do in this case.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
So what are you missing?  It obviously follows that if you eliminate the<br>
government, you eliminate the power elite.  The only power elite that can<br>
exist in a free market, exist by their own ingenuity.  What's so wrong with<br>
a level playing field?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; : Luddism is a perfectly understandable reaction in capitalism. Because in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : a capitalist society, progress in production efficiency will often hurt</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : the population. The more efficient you are, the less workers you need.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : More unemployment. 4,5 million registered in Germany today, and rising.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Another example is the United States, where unemployment is at a record<br>
lows attributed almost entirely to increased productivity in the economy.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; So why did employment in the Nottingham textile industry (origin of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; term "Luddite") increase with mechanization?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Short-term development because of cheaper and better goods and still high</i><br>
<i>&gt;demands (sometimes the market laws indeed apply). Working conditions,</i><br>
however,<br>
<i>&gt;worsened dramatically. That's why the Luddite movement was started - not</i><br>
<i>&gt;because people were just technophobic, but because they suddenly had to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;more work for less money and/or work under extreme conditions. The Luddites</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The only people who have to work harder are people too inflexible or too<br>
stupid to work smarter.  Average people would enjoy the benefits of<br>
progress a great deal more if they spent more of their energy accustomizing<br>
themselves to it rather than resisting it.  Ability to adapt *is* an<br>
evolutionary advantage.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Of course there are no state regulatory barriers to employment,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; only reactionary "libertarians" believe that, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Right. German industry complained about the oh-so-high loan costs from</i><br>
<i>&gt;1995-1996 and promised to create jobs when they would not have to pay so</i><br>
much.<br>
<i>&gt;Further cuts in the social system were made. Now German industry complains</i><br>
<i>&gt;about the oh-so-high loan costs again. Further cuts in the social system are</i><br>
<i>&gt;made. Then ... Get the idea? And all the time, unemployment has not decreased</i><br>
<i>&gt;a bit, instead it has risen. And neither in 1995 nor in 1999 the German</i><br>
<i>&gt;industry was in a bad situation. Fact is, each year they make record profits.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
In a free market economy, it is highly unlikely that all the major<br>
industries would be making record profits and unemployment would be<br>
increasing.  Most likely this is the result of subsidies, where a company<br>
can make a decent profit, but be terribly non-competitive in the face of<br>
foreign competition.  Many European countries are in this situation right<br>
now, especially in the tech industries.  If government support didn't exist<br>
for these industries, darwinian selection would have bred industries that<br>
could actually result in economy-improving profits (government provided<br>
profits are worthless as the money is effectively removed from the economy<br>
in the first place).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; : About military: Why do you think we have it? Because some bums in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; : government think we need it to defend our country?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Because military forces have been around longer than anyone can remember,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and few dare question their necessity?  I dunno, you tell us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, I won't. Give me a rational explanation. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Too protect populations from people with power who don't have your high<br>
moral standards?  Actually, there is a rather large difference between<br>
European militaries and the US military in general (which may be tempering<br>
your view).  In many European countries (Germany, for example) the military<br>
is used as an auxiliary police arm of the government, many times quite<br>
violently.  This is simply not the case with the professional US<br>
militaries, which have virtually no adversarial contact within the domestic<br>
population.<br>
