 Random numbers are complex. The tit-for-tat strategy is simple.<br>
Increasing those other features you mentioned may tend to cause an increase<br>
in complexity, but that doesn't make complexity valuable in and of itself,<br>
nor a good indicator of the others.<br>
 This is particularly true of moral systems. A moral system, if it is to<br>
be more than a personal set of habits, must be something that a community<br>
can agree to follow. Simplicity is valuable in a moral system because<br>
the easier it is to follow a moral system, the easier it is to keep it<br>
effective by drawing a clear dividing line between those who follow it<br>
and those who reject it. Also, the more rules a system has, the harder it<br>
is to achieve a consensus about it.<br>
<p>
 Vegetarianism, unless accompanied by a clear principle for dividing<br>
nonhuman lifeforms into those whose rights we respect and those we don't,<br>
risks blurring the boundaries in a way that makes it seem easier to<br>
for people to decide that that boundary is just a matter of personal<br>
choice.<br>
