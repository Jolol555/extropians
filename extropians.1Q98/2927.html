Luckily, you're not different from yourself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The definition</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of "identity" as "same as" is a total confusion as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to the nature of what identity IS. To the absolute</i><br>
<i>&gt;  contrary, "identity" is "different than." </i><br>
<p>
Again: you're confusing identity with description.  You have in the past<br>
given examples such as "the shortest man in the world", and rightly<br>
pointed out that the man is so described only because there are other<br>
people.  But this is description, not identity.  The man would still be<br>
identical to himself if he were the only man in the universe; his<br>
identity would remain, only his description would change.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Minus</i><br>
<i>&gt;  difference is minus identity, </i><br>
<p>
Black is white.  Ignorance is strength.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and therefore to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  define identity based upon the similarity of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  thing with itself is an error and irrational.</i><br>
<p>
And yet that is how "identity" is defined, according to the very<br>
dictionaries you cited.  The word was coined (in the 14C, ac.to OED)<br>
from the Latin word _idem_ `the same'.  Please make a note of that:<br>
_idem_ does not mean `different'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The difference between A and A is null, is zero,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and thus the statement "A=A" is a null statement.</i><br>
<p>
It is a null statement, yes, in that it provides no new information. <br>
But if A and B (not previously known to be identical) are equated (A=B),<br>
that is new information: the amount of difference between A and B is<br>
measured and found to be zero.<br>
<p>
Perhaps we need to distinguish between mathematical identity - identity<br>
as applied to abstract constructs, which can be indefinitely copied<br>
without creating a distinction between the copies - and the identity of<br>
a tangible object (with itself).  The tune of "Greensleeves" and that of<br>
"What Child Is This" are identical, but two copies of the sheet-music<br>
for "Greensleeves" are not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Identity is 100% holistic and 0% atomistic, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  thus, a 100% atomistic definition is 100% false.</i><br>
<p>
You seem to be defining identity as "description by relation to<br>
something else".  That's an interesting concept, and no doubt there's<br>
room for plenty of discussion about it; but it's *not* identity.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; and since nobody has ever been able to show</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; a single example where this claim is true</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; -- showing A being A free from any associa-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; tion to not-A --</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;-- which is not an element of that or any other definition of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;identity that I've ever come across --</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: Well I don't know what definitions</i><br>
<i>&gt;   your reading, but even the Three Laws of</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Thought -- (1) A is A (2) A is not both A</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and not-A (3) A is A or not-A -- could not</i><br>
<i>&gt;   more clearly define the "identity" of A as</i><br>
<i>&gt;   being 100% exclusive to A, which is false.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know what you mean by "association" here, but these Laws clearly<br>
do *not* deny all relation between A and not-A: they have the relation<br>
of inequality or non-identity.  (Duh.)<br>
<p>
If I say "there is no relation between A and B," I do *not* mean that A<br>
and B are never equal; I mean that no statement about their equality is<br>
consistently true -- they're sometimes equal, sometimes not, without any<br>
causal linkage.  If on the other hand "A and B are never equal", there<br>
*is* a relation between them (the Pauli exclusion principle is an<br>
example).<br>
