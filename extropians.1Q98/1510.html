<i>&gt; &gt; The goal IMHO should be drugs that are as independent of set and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; setting as possible - they should work even if you don't believe in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; them. Sure, set and setting can build a lot on this, but without a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; strong pharmacological basis you could as well eat sugar pills and use</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the placebo constructively.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well put. I'm often wondering if the effects I enjoy on the drug are</i><br>
<i>&gt; learned and only triggered psychological reactions to being drugged.</i><br>
<p>
Most likely a bit of both. I get more energetic by drinking Coca Cola,<br>
despite the fact that the caffeine contents are far below my rather<br>
high threshold. It is a learned reflex, but quite useful.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What do you think about the effects of meditation and relaxation on</i><br>
<i>&gt; creativity?</i><br>
<p>
Relaxation unequivocally promotes creativity; that seems to be the<br>
general consensus. Of course, you need to be active enough to do<br>
something with the ideas, but otherwise tension reduces creativity a<br>
lot.<br>
<p>
Meditation is a bit more contentious. My impression is that the<br>
benefits are mainly due to the relaxation and the fact that you spend<br>
time exploring your own thinking processes, learning to control them<br>
and change their flow. But that may be very individual and have very<br>
different effects in different people, so I'm not sure about the<br>
overall effect on creativity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For a while, I considered that perhaps hemp put me into a state similar to</i><br>
<i>&gt; that of a meditation guru.  Perhaps this sent me down the road to thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt; I was really short cutting years of serious mental discipline...?</i><br>
<p>
Most likely not. There is more to being a guru than bliss :-) <br>
<p>
We had an interesting discussion today at a course in biological<br>
psychology I attend about the effects of antidepressants like Prozac<br>
on depression compared to cognitive behavior therapy. It turns out<br>
that Prozac makes people feel better and gets them out of the<br>
depression, but they have a large probability of relapse. CBT on the<br>
other hand works even better and has a fairly good prognosis<br>
afterwards. The combination of CBT and Prozac isn't synergetic, it is<br>
just as good as CBT alone. On the other hand, Prozac can help people<br>
out from the really deep depression so that they can start with<br>
CBT. What makes the difference is that Prozac doesn't give you any<br>
strategies of keeping out of the depressive state, while CBT attempts<br>
to. So if this can be extended as an analogy, chemical methods might<br>
miss the important cognitive structures you would like to set up in<br>
order to really profit from the experience. This might also fit in<br>
with your musical experiences with hemp: you need to develop or learn<br>
how to use it properly in order to get any use out of it.<br>
