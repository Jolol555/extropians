Yak Wax mentioned that he could will his mind to run faster and it<br>
eventually made it so.  I have done something similar with my senses (I<br>
mentioned this on the list about a year and a half ago, but I think it<br>
should be repeated, especially for new list members).  A few years ago, I<br>
somehow got the intense desire to have better senses.  This led me to pay<br>
more attention to my senses, because I realized that improved senses<br>
aren't any good unless I pay attention to them, and I realized that I was<br>
ignoring most of my sensory input anyway, and learning to pay attention<br>
to that vast amount of information was the first key in improving my<br>
senses.  <br>
<p>
My exercises started first with persistent reminders to myself to pay<br>
attention to my senses.  As the need for reminders became less frequent,<br>
I began focusing more on noticing more details in my senses.  I would<br>
listen to "the sounds between the sounds" and look for more minute detail<br>
in things I sensed.  I practiced much; I would frequently go for long<br>
walks, spending most of the time paying close attention to my senses,<br>
which continued to become more vivid and detailed over the course of<br>
months, and are still improving today.  I also practiced much while doing<br>
my regular daily activities.<br>
<p>
I think the most important area of focus when improving my senses was<br>
learning to pay conscious attention to so much information.  And one big<br>
key to doing that was learning to be interested in vast amounts of<br>
information which doesn't really matter.  Most sensory information didn't<br>
really matter to me, so I ignored it, but when I determined to pay<br>
attention to as much as I could,  my sensory world really started opening<br>
up, and ordinary things became fascinating delights.  I eventually<br>
learned to see and appreciate so much beauty in my world that I simply<br>
overlooked before because I didn't think it mattered.  Now there's so<br>
much vivid detail in everything, even the most common-place things seem<br>
interesting.<br>
<p>
By learning to pay attention to more detail in a given unit of time, I<br>
have noticed that my thinking, in general, has gotten quicker.  I have<br>
trained myself to process sensory information faster, but it seems to<br>
have helped me process cognitive information faster too.  It's also made<br>
it easier to switch from thought to thought and think of several thoughts<br>
simultaneously, since that's what I do when I use my senses; I<br>
consciously think (to some degree) about everything I sense, and my<br>
sensory data keeps changing, especially as I move around.  Because I've<br>
spent so much time paying attention to my senses and continually<br>
analyzing and interpreting them, my mind has shaped itself around those<br>
sorts of activities.  Before improving my senses, I was extremely<br>
intellectual, and had a hard time thinking outside of rigid categories. <br>
As I focused on my senses, my intellect gradually gained new thinking<br>
styles that were more related to interpreting and analyzing the sensory<br>
world.  My thinking became much more dynamic, detailed and powerful (it<br>
also became more multi-tasking, switching among several lines of<br>
thinking, rather than focusing on one until it was done).<br>
<p>
It's been very rewarding for me to see the vast improvement I've<br>
experienced in my senses over the past few years; rewarding because now<br>
things look, sound, feel, taste and smell so fascinating and beautiful,<br>
and rewarding because I was able to pursue my goal of modifying myself in<br>
that way and succeed.  <br>
<p>
As my senses became very good, I realized that I could probably improve<br>
my thinking even more by learning to pay more attention to cognitive<br>
information.  This has proved to be more difficult and elusive than<br>
paying attention to sensory information, but I persist in working on it,<br>
and I am making some improvements.  <br>
<p>
I have come to believe that attention is a big key to improving oneself. <br>
It's basically a way of getting feedback, and without feedback, directed<br>
change approaches impossibility.<br>
<p>
I think it would be useful for list members to discuss the effective ways<br>
they have discovered for improving various aspects of themselves.<br>
