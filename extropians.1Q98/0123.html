Steve, I'm just expressing my opinion. Surely, there is no issue of <br>
right or wrong in the mere expression of an opinion. As for it being <br>
necessary, it certainly isn't. Is this board "necessary?" No, but it's <br>
kinda fun.<br>
<p>
Also, there is a big difference between me taking sides and the state <br>
taking sides. The state has the legal use of force at its disposal and I <br>
don't except in a few limited circumstances. The state can send people <br>
to jail and take their money and property and I can't. <br>
<p>
Actually, I am basing my opinion on a news story. It may be totally <br>
wrong. In such case, I may revise my opinion. However, we can only go on <br>
the information we have, and infomation is always imperfect.<br>
<p>
Perhaps the boy's father is a violent person who also kicks animals <br>
everyday and is really vile. That could be true. Or maybe, like my <br>
father, he just gives his kids I few whacks when they are really bad. <br>
(However, I never did anything as bad as kick a cat's head!) Based on <br>
the information I had, I think the later is the case. But I may be <br>
wrong.<br>
