Ian Goddard writes that the mystical notion of "holism" is more <br>
likely the "Truth" because it doesn't impose the boundaries that the <br>
mind uses to make its way in the world.<br>
<p>
I find this whole line of thinking to be unconvincing.  Centuries of <br>
thought have tried to convince people that one or another point of <br>
view is "Truth" and everything else is mere illusion.  The notion <br>
that there is some "Super" truth behind mere, everyday truth is a <br>
religious notion that serves no purpose whatever.  <br>
<p>
Why should we think that holism is more real than boundaryism?  Maybe <br>
holism is an artificial construct of the mind.  It may, in fact, be <br>
impossible to think of anything at all without thinking of at least<br>
two things that are some somehow related and interacting.  Try, I <br>
mean, really try, to think of just one thing without it being related <br>
to anything else at all.  What could you possibly be thinking of?<br>
<p>
This discussion of mine is inadequate, to be sure.  My sense is that <br>
extropians and transhumanists shouldn't try to re-capture a religious <br>
sense in mystical notions of holism vs. boundaryism.  Let's just use <br>
the theories for what they're worth and forget about which one is <br>
more "true" than the other.<br>
<p>
BTW, I have found Lee Smolin's "Life of the Cosmos" to be a most <br>
compelling discussion of these types issues.<br>
