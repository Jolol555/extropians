 <br>
<i>&gt; We really need to know its velocity in a bad way. A slow asteroid hitting </i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't be to bad. A fast one would be very bad...</i><br>
<p>
In practice there is no such thing as "a slow asteroid hitting".  <br>
There are only "too damn fast" and "even faster".   The MINIMUM <br>
impact speed we can plausibly expect is escape velocity, and this is <br>
assuming that the body's former orbit nearly amounted to a docking <br>
maneuver with Earth -- any variation from that will either *increase* <br>
the impact speed, or prevent a collision.<br>
<p>
Now a slow collision with an aeroshell manufactured in orbit from <br>
asteroidal materials, is a completely different matter...<br>
<p>
Another factor to consider is that there are some potential orbital <br>
hazards that are easy to spot because they are in only mildly <br>
elliptical orbits and don't get much further from the sun than the <br>
earth does.  And there are others that are much harder to spot <br>
because they are in seriously elliptical orbits and spend most of <br>
their time substantially further from the sun (i.e. less well lit).  <br>
These latter bodies also have the interesting characteristic that <br>
they are much more likely to *not* orbit in the plane of the ecliptic <br>
(or anywhere near it), so they are more likely to come from a totally <br>
unexpected reaction.<br>
<p>
And for the real kicker: they'll be moving a *lot* faster when they <br>
cross earth orbit.<br>
