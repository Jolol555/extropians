Thanks.  I'm glad you like it.  Are you an extropian?  Return to Sender<br>
from my Netscape 4.0 browser defaulted to this address so I added your law<br>
firm address too.  Anyway, you have a great web site and I said so in mine<br>
where legal issues are addressed re: human cloning at:<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9356/Webbio1.htm#bioethics">http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9356/Webbio1.htm#bioethics</a>.<br>
 Until later, -Bill.<br>

Also, if you think my comments in the citing of your site are factually<br>
incorrect, please let me know)<br>
