I feel the same in the sense that I do not think these opinion-type articles<br>
have any place in a journal that touts itself as a scientific resource for<br>
sophisticated layman.  Many SciAm readers lack of the scientific proficiency to<br>
separate author opinion from scientific consensus or fact.  SciAm should be<br>
especially vigilant in reviewing the content of its articles.  Several articles<br>
(including the nanotechnology article and the value of animals in medical<br>
research) reminded me more of the dogmatic presentation of facts you see from<br>
politicians, not scientists.<br>
<p>
SciAm was definitely called out on the carpet regarding the nanotechnology<br>
ordeal.  What the editors were thinking when they allowed that article through<br>
is anyone's guess.  However, I think that as long as readers continue to hold<br>
SciAm accountable for what it prints, we can keep SciAm from becoming a journal<br>
of opinion.<br>
