But there's a deeper meaning here, not just about these tactics but about<br>
the management of complexity.<br>

<i>&gt;                     "I Did It For You All..."</i><br>
<i>&gt; ______________________________________________________________</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; On the 1st of January, 1998, Bjarne Stroustrup gave an interview</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the IEEE's 'Computer' magazine..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Naturally, the editors thought he would be giving a retrospective</i><br>
<i>&gt; view of seven years of object-oriented design, using the language</i><br>
<i>&gt; he created.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; By the end of the interview, the interviewer got more than he had</i><br>
<i>&gt; bargained for and, subsequently, the editor decided to suppress its</i><br>
<i>&gt; contents, 'for the good of the industry' but, as with many of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; things, there was a leak..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Here is a complete transcript of what was was said, unedited, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; unrehearsed, so it isn't as neat as planned interviews..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You will find it interesting....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; __________________________________________________________________</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Well, it's been a few years since you changed the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         world of software design, how does it feel, looking back?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Actually, I was thinking about those days, just before</i><br>
<i>&gt;         you arrived.  Do you remember?  Everyone was writing 'C'</i><br>
<i>&gt;         and, the trouble was, they were pretty damn good at it..</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Universities got pretty good at teaching it, too.  They were</i><br>
<i>&gt;         turning out competent - I stress the word 'competent' -</i><br>
<i>&gt;         graduates at a phenomenal rate.  That's what caused the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         problem..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Problem?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Yes, problem.  Remember when everyone wrote Cobol?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Of course, I did too</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Well, in the beginning, these guys were like</i><br>
<i>&gt;         demi-gods.  Their salaries were high, and they were treated</i><br>
<i>&gt;         like royalty..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Those were the days, eh?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Right.  So what happened?  IBM got sick of it, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;         invested millions in training programmers, till they were a</i><br>
<i>&gt;         dime a dozen..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  That's why I got out.  Salaries dropped within a year,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         to the point where being a journalist actually paid better..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Exactly.  Well, the same happened with 'C' programmers..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  I see, but what's the point?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Well, one day, when I was sitting in my office, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;         thought of this little scheme, which would redress the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         balance a little.  I thought 'I wonder what would happen, if</i><br>
<i>&gt;         there were a language so complicated, so difficult to learn,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         that nobody would ever be able to swamp the market with</i><br>
<i>&gt;         programmers?  Actually, I got some of the ideas from X10,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         you know, X windows.  That was such a bitch of a graphics</i><br>
<i>&gt;         system, that it only just ran on those Sun 3/60 things..</i><br>
<i>&gt;         They had all the ingredients for what I wanted.  A really</i><br>
<i>&gt;         ridiculously complex syntax, obscure functions, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;         pseudo-OO structure.  Even now, nobody writes raw X-windows</i><br>
<i>&gt;         code.  Motif is the only way to go if you want to retain</i><br>
<i>&gt;         your sanity..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  You're kidding...?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Not a bit of it.  In fact, there was another problem..</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Unix was written in 'C', which meant that any 'C' programmer</i><br>
<i>&gt;         could very easily become a systems programmer.  Remember</i><br>
<i>&gt;         what a mainframe systems programmer used to earn?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  You bet I do, that's what I used to do..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  OK, so this new language had to divorce itself from</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Unix, by hiding all the system calls that bound the two</i><br>
<i>&gt;         together so nicely.  This would enable guys who only knew</i><br>
<i>&gt;         about DOS to earn a decent living too..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  I don't believe you said that....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Well, it's been long enough, now, and I believe most</i><br>
<i>&gt;         people have figured out for themselves that C++ is a waste</i><br>
<i>&gt;         of time but, I must say, it's taken them a lot longer than I</i><br>
<i>&gt;         thought it would..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  So how exactly did you do it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  It was only supposed to be a joke, I never thought</i><br>
<i>&gt;         people would take the book seriously.  Anyone with half a</i><br>
<i>&gt;         brain can see that object-oriented programming is</i><br>
<i>&gt;         counter-intuitive, illogical and inefficient..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  What?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  And as for 're-useable code' - when did you ever hear</i><br>
<i>&gt;         of a company re-using its code?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Well, never, actually, but....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  There you are then.  Mind you, a few tried, in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         early days.  There was this Oregon company - Mentor</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Graphics, I think they were called - really caught a cold</i><br>
<i>&gt;         trying to rewrite everything in C++ in about '90 or '91.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;         felt sorry for them really, but I thought people would learn</i><br>
<i>&gt;         from their mistakes..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Obviously, they didn't?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Not in the slightest.  Trouble is, most companies</i><br>
<i>&gt;         hush-up all their major blunders, and explaining a $30</i><br>
<i>&gt;         million loss to the shareholders would have been difficult..</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Give them their due, though, they made it work in the end..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  They did?  Well, there you are then, it proves O-O works..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Well, almost.  The executable was so huge, it took</i><br>
<i>&gt;         five minutes to load, on an HP workstation, with 128MB of</i><br>
<i>&gt;         RAM.  Then it ran like treacle.  Actually, I thought this</i><br>
<i>&gt;         would be a major stumbling-block, and I'd get found out</i><br>
<i>&gt;         within a week, but nobody cared.  Sun and HP were only too</i><br>
<i>&gt;         glad to sell enormously powerful boxes, with huge resources</i><br>
<i>&gt;         just to run trivial programs.  You know, when we had our</i><br>
<i>&gt;         first C++ compiler, at AT&amp;T, I compiled 'Hello World', and</i><br>
<i>&gt;         couldn't believe the size of the executable.  2.1MB</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  What?  Well, compilers have come a long way, since then..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  They have?  Try it on the latest version of g++ - you</i><br>
<i>&gt;         won't get much change out of half a megabyte.  Also, there</i><br>
<i>&gt;         are several quite recent examples for you, from all over the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         world.  British Telecom had a major disaster on their hands</i><br>
<i>&gt;         but, luckily, managed to scrap the whole thing and start</i><br>
<i>&gt;         again.  They were luckier than Australian Telecom.  Now I</i><br>
<i>&gt;         hear that Siemens is building a dinosaur, and getting more</i><br>
<i>&gt;         and more worried as the size of the hardware gets bigger, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;         accommodate the executables.  Isn't multiple inheritance a</i><br>
<i>&gt;         joy?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Yes, but C++ is basically a sound language..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  You really believe that, don't you?  Have you ever sat</i><br>
<i>&gt;         down and worked on a C++ project?  Here's what happens:</i><br>
<i>&gt;         First, I've put in enough pitfalls to make sure that only</i><br>
<i>&gt;         the most trivial projects will work first time.  Take</i><br>
<i>&gt;         operator overloading.  At the end of the project, almost</i><br>
<i>&gt;         every module has it, usually, because guys feel they really</i><br>
<i>&gt;         should do it, as it was in their training course.  The same</i><br>
<i>&gt;         operator then means something totally different in every</i><br>
<i>&gt;         module.  Try pulling that lot together, when you have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;         hundred or so modules.  And as for data hiding.  God, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;         sometimes can't help laughing when I hear about the problems</i><br>
<i>&gt;         companies have making their modules talk to each other.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;         think the word 'synergistic' was specially invented to twist</i><br>
<i>&gt;         the knife in a project manager's ribs..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  I have to say, I'm beginning to be quite appalled at</i><br>
<i>&gt;         all this.  You say you did it to raise programmers'</i><br>
<i>&gt;         salaries?  That's obscene..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Not really.  Everyone has a choice.  I didn't expect</i><br>
<i>&gt;         the thing to get so much out of hand.  Anyway, I basically</i><br>
<i>&gt;         succeeded.  C++ is dying off now, but programmers still get</i><br>
<i>&gt;         high salaries - especially those poor devils who have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;         maintain all this crap.  You do realise, it's impossible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;         maintain a large C++ software module if you didn't actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;         write it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  How come?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  You are out of touch, aren't you?  Remember the typedef?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Yes, of course..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Remember how long it took to grope through the header</i><br>
<i>&gt;         files only to find that 'RoofRaised' was a double precision</i><br>
<i>&gt;         number?  Well, imagine how long it takes to find all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         implicit typedefs in all the Classes in a major project..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  So how do you reckon you've succeeded?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Remember the length of the average-sized 'C' project?</i><br>
<i>&gt;         About 6 months.  Not nearly long enough for a guy with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;         wife and kids to earn enough to have a decent standard of</i><br>
<i>&gt;         living.  Take the same project, design it in C++ and what do</i><br>
<i>&gt;         you get?  I'll tell you.  One to two years.  Isn't that</i><br>
<i>&gt;         great?  All that job security, just through one mistake of</i><br>
<i>&gt;         judgement.  And another thing.  The universities haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt;         been teaching 'C' for such a long time, there's now a</i><br>
<i>&gt;         shortage of decent 'C' programmers.  Especially those who</i><br>
<i>&gt;         know anything about Unix systems programming.  How many guys</i><br>
<i>&gt;         would know what to do with 'malloc', when they've used 'new'</i><br>
<i>&gt;         all these years - and never bothered to check the return</i><br>
<i>&gt;         code.  In fact, most C++ programmers throw away their return</i><br>
<i>&gt;         codes.  Whatever happened to good ol' '-1'?  At least you</i><br>
<i>&gt;         knew you had an error, without bogging the thing down in all</i><br>
<i>&gt;         that 'throw' 'catch' 'try' stuff..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  But, surely, inheritance does save a lot of time?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Does it?  Have you ever noticed the difference between</i><br>
<i>&gt;         a 'C' project plan, and a C++ project plan?  The planning</i><br>
<i>&gt;         stage for a C++ project is three times as long.  Precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt;         to make sure that everything which should be inherited is,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         and what shouldn't isn't.  Then, they still get it wrong..</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Whoever heard of memory leaks in a 'C' program?  Now finding</i><br>
<i>&gt;         them is a major industry.  Most companies give up, and send</i><br>
<i>&gt;         the product out, knowing it leaks like a sieve, simply to</i><br>
<i>&gt;         avoid the expense of tracking them all down..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  There are tools.....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Most of which were written in C++..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  If we publish this, you'll probably get lynched, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;         do realise that?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  I doubt it.  As I said, C++ is way past its peak now,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         and no company in its right mind would start a C++ project</i><br>
<i>&gt;         without a pilot trial.  That should convince them that it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;         the road to disaster.  If not, they deserve all they get..</i><br>
<i>&gt;         You know, I tried to convince Dennis Ritchie to rewrite Unix</i><br>
<i>&gt;         in C++..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Oh my God.  What did he say?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Well, luckily, he has a good sense of humor.  I think</i><br>
<i>&gt;         both he and Brian figured out what I was doing, in the early</i><br>
<i>&gt;         days, but never let on.  He said he'd help me write a C++</i><br>
<i>&gt;         version of DOS, if I was interested..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Were you?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Actually, I did write DOS in C++, I'll give you a demo</i><br>
<i>&gt;         when we're through.  I have it running on a Sparc 20 in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         computer room.  Goes like a rocket on 4 CPU's, and only</i><br>
<i>&gt;         takes up 70 megs of disk..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  What's it like on a PC?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Now you're kidding.  Haven't you ever seen Windows '95?</i><br>
<i>&gt;         I think of that as my biggest success.  Nearly blew the game</i><br>
<i>&gt;         before I was ready, though..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  You know, that idea of a Unix++ has really got me</i><br>
<i>&gt;         thinking.  Somewhere out there, there's a guy going to try</i><br>
<i>&gt;         it..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Not after they read this interview..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  I'm sorry, but I don't see us being able to publish</i><br>
<i>&gt;         any of this..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  But it's the story of the century.  I only want to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;         remembered by my fellow programmers, for what I've done for</i><br>
<i>&gt;         them.  You know how much a C++ guy can get these days?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Last I heard, a really top guy is worth $70 - $80 an</i><br>
<i>&gt;         hour..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  See?  And I bet he earns it.  Keeping track of all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         gotchas I put into C++ is no easy job.  And, as I said</i><br>
<i>&gt;         before, every C++ programmer feels bound by some mystic</i><br>
<i>&gt;         promise to use every damn element of the language on every</i><br>
<i>&gt;         project.  Actually, that really annoys me sometimes, even</i><br>
<i>&gt;         though it serves my original purpose.  I almost like the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         language after all this time..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  You mean you didn't before?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Hated it.  It even looks clumsy, don't you agree?  But</i><br>
<i>&gt;         when the book royalties started to come in...  well, you get</i><br>
<i>&gt;         the picture..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Just a minute.  What about references?  You must</i><br>
<i>&gt;         admit, you improved on 'C' pointers..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stroustrup:  Hmm.  I've always wondered about that.  Originally, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;         thought I had.  Then, one day I was discussing this with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;         guy who'd written C++ from the beginning.  He said he could</i><br>
<i>&gt;         never remember whether his variables were referenced or</i><br>
<i>&gt;         dereferenced, so he always used pointers.  He said the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         little asterisk always reminded him..</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Interviewer:  Well, at this point, I usually say 'thank you very</i><br>
