<i>&gt; Extropian art?  I've just do not get it.  What is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; significance of art by people who actively strive for</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanism.  I am not saying it has no significance.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; how significant is it in the grand scheme of things?</i><br>
<p>
In the context your using it, I could really care less about the grand<br>
scheme of things.  What I do care about, is the life I lead and those I<br>
find around me.  Only then can you have any significant impact on the<br>
"grand scheme of things".  Besides, a life without art or beauty is a<br>
life not worth living.  What's the point of living indefinitely if you<br>
can't enjoy it?  That includes sex - the most intimate connection<br>
possible between two entities in the known universe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I just do not see the relevance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; even addressing sex or fashion in the same context with</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussions about nanotechnology, AI, uploading, Singularities,</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc.</i><br>
<p>
Nanotechnology has to be the most sexy thing I can possibly conceive.<br>
Imagine the degrees of intimacy that will become possible between two or<br>
more uploaded conscious beings.  For all intents and purpose, two<br>
uploaded people could completely merge into one super-entity - the<br>
offspring of their own memes.  If that does not make sex relevant, I<br>
don't know what does.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; New ways of thinking are very vulnerable to being viewed as</i><br>
<i>&gt; cultish nonsense.  Nonsense in the vein that people seize ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt; that resemble salvation from present circumstances. Designated</i><br>
<i>&gt; groups, name changing, questionable commitment to the real issues,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it sounds like a cult more than an intellectual critique of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; future (and more importantly how we can get there while also</i><br>
<i>&gt; performing the trick of survival).</i><br>
<p>
If we eliminate all name changing from history - "ooggaa lulao ugga<br>
lugga!" is all we got left!  As for questionable commitment to real<br>
issues; death and taxes are real issues - issues which this community<br>
has addressed with some of the most constructive solutions I have ever<br>
seen. Do you have any better ideas? If so, lets hear them!  Besides, the<br>
level of commitment of people like Max More who went from publishing a<br>
small college zine, to gathering some of the greatest thinkers (Marvin<br>
Minsky, Eric Drexler, Ralph Merkle, Kevin Kelly, F.M Esfandiary, Roy<br>
Walford) into one room is highly commendable...  Questionable commitment<br>
to real issues - what are you talking about?<br>
