Re:MJ<br>
Obviously overuse is a bad idea but for myself, some of the best code I've<br>
written has been produced while mildly stoned.<br>
<p>
There's nothing wrong with doing drugs, it's when the drugs start doing<br>
_you_ that you have to worry.<br>
<p>
Rule of thumb: If it spills over into other areas of your life in a<br>
negative way, it needs to be looked into.<br>

about<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>

couple<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;i'm not so sure.  i do agree with its effects as an aphrodisiac and a</i><br>
<i>&gt;sensory enhancer, but not as as a critical thinking tool due to two</i><br>

<i>&gt;(or at least i) are stoned, are just pretty standard cool ideas otherwise</i><br>
<i>&gt;(that is ideas that you do get while in normal state but don't get past</i><br>
<i>&gt;the higher critical level of "originality" needed for it to be remembered)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Secondly, it puts me to sleep, unless i fight it, so not much enjoyment</i><br>

Think of it as evolutio in action.<br>
