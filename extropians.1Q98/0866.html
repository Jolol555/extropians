When anyone uses the term "people," they're obviously not including<br>
themselves.  What are you, stupid?<br>

Coming back to reality, I've made several suggestions along these<br>
lines before.  ExI (or perhaps a spin-off) should dedicate themselves<br>
to making sure the necessary research gets done, no matter what.  I'm<br>
100% sure that there are many extremely rich people out there who<br>
would put vast amounts of money into life-extension and genetic<br>
enhancement research.  All we have to do is forgo any moral or ethical<br>
imperative and take the money.<br>
