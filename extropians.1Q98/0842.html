<i>|There is a problem with conspiracy theories.  On the whole, they</i><br>
<i>|are wrong.  </i><br>
<p>
Unsupported assertion.<br>
<p>
<i>|Surely, people do conspire, but it is not as successful</i><br>
<i>|as conspiracy theorists think.</i><br>
<p>
Unsupported assertion.<br>
<p>
<i>|Also, as for its utility, it has a way of backfiring.  Those deeply</i><br>
<i>|mired in conspiracy theories, from my experience, are either</i><br>
<i>|apathetic -- because they believe they are impotent while any</i><br>
<i>|group of conspirers are omnipotent -- or pro-government --</i><br>
<i>|because they think government as a institution is great, if</i><br>
<i>|it weren't for those evil conspiracies.  In other words, eliminate</i><br>
<i>|the conspiracies and we can have a welfare state or a total</i><br>
<i>|democracy that really works.  Thus, they are utopians.</i><br>
<p>
True, the wrong conspiracy theories can be bad for liberty. That is<br>
why it is important that liberty advocates get off their butts and<br>
show government for the conspiracy of special, predatory interests it is.<br>
<p>
Government itself rides on conspiracy theories, ie. the one that<br>
the private sector is rife with predation from which only government<br>
can protect us....however, objectively it is government that always<br>
has been the conspiracy against liberty and justice.   Libertarians,<br>
individualists, and extropians need to counter with the appropriate,<br>
objective conspiracy theories integrated with an advocacy of liberty.<br>
<p>
<i>|These are the risks you run if you spread this meme.  Another</i><br>
<i>|risk is that those who have no affinity for the simplistic</i><br>
<p>
The objective conspiracy theories are not simplistic....they are very<br>
complex, in fact, the very essence of the heirarchal complexity that<br>
is society.  <br>
<p>
<i>|explanations of conspiracy theorists tend to think you are a</i><br>
<i>|kook.  Thus, you gain influence amongst simpletons only to</i><br>
<i>|lose it amongst those who would be better to have as allies.</i><br>
<p>
If you are an extropian you are a kook.  If you are a libertarian you<br>
are a kook.  If you have an objective, instead of pro-govt wishful<br>
view of government, you are a conspiracy kook.  The existing intelligencia<br>
is the essence of STATISM....they have to be defeated.  If your "pro-<br>
liberty" strategy does not ellicit howls of outrage and derision<br>
from the Statist intelligencia you are doing something wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>|I wouldn't bring this up if the average person, rightly or</i><br>
<i>|wrongly -- and this applies to the average smart person</i><br>
<i>|too -- thinks our ideas are weird or even insane.  Now,</i><br>
<i>|couple transhumanism/Extropianism with conspiracy</i><br>
<i>|theories and see if you are taken more seriously.</i><br>
<p>
Would make no difference to those who react only on the<br>
basis of determining if an idea is socially acceptable...Extropianism<br>
is not socially acceptable, libertarianism is not socially acceptable,<br>
conspiracy theory is not socially acceptable...ONLY THE GROWING<br>
OF THE STATE IS SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE...GET IT?  We are in<br>
the State's memetic field.<br>
