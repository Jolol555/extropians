I contest the notion that we cannot keep a 1:1 model of ourselves in our <br>
minds.  It is obvious that by 1:1 you do not mean "an exact duplicate, <br>
not merely enough information to produce an exact duplicate", since it <br>
is obvious that no physical system can also be another physical system <br>
(i.e. our brain cannot also be our brain &amp; our body).  And it is also <br>
obvious that a system can keep within it enough information to reproduce <br>
itself, and some more information.  This is obvious since living <br>
organisms and computer viruses do this all the time.<br>
<p>
So while it may (or may not) be physically impossible for a human to <br>
know enough to produce an exact duplicate of themselves, it is certainly <br>
not provable that no mind can know enough to produce an exact duplicate <br>
of itself + some more information.  As a matter of fact, the opposite is <br>
very strongly indicated, since other information systems produce exact <br>
duplicates of themselves all the time (computer viruses and living <br>
things that reproduce asexually, to within a small margin of error).<br>
<p>
Please show me the flaw in my reasoning.<br>

PS  Dallas extropians &amp; transhumans, I'm interested in get-togethers if <br>
anyone would like to email me.<br>
