Hey, thanks for the lists!  It's great to read about people who are <br>
members (of whatever gender) of EXI, and what they do.<br>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt;  I just think it's sad that we even have to have this kind of<br>
discussion.  I'd love to get some projects done on the subject of<br>
gender and leave it behind to pursue other interests, like<br>
technological innovations, but then I realize how much work remains<br>
to be done...<br>
<p>
