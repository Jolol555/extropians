<i>&gt; Regrettably the most common view, also depicted in many movies and </i><br>
<i>&gt; television series (including for example in "Raiders of the lost Ark" </i><br>
<i>&gt; and many Star Trek episodes :-&lt; ), is that wishing to extend your </i><br>
<i>&gt; life span is unethical and immoral. </i><br>
<p>
But it should be noted that in the third Indiana Jones movie both<br>
father and son drinks from the Grail, presumably becoming immortal<br>
even if that wasn't their reason for drinking.<br>
<p>
But overall, the "Tithonus syndrome" is rampant in literature,<br>
including science fiction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I recently wrote to a Dutch newspaper where an article quoted a </i><br>
<i>&gt; theology professor (member of an European ethical commission! :-&lt; ) </i><br>
<i>&gt; claiming that a wish for immortality is not acceptable. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I stated that it is wrong to decide what is ethically acceptable </i><br>
<i>&gt; based on a belief. A belief is just a faith, it has not been proven </i><br>
<i>&gt; and can therefore be wrong. Furthermore there are many different </i><br>
<i>&gt; believes. "When the church is going to decide what is ethically </i><br>
<i>&gt; acceptable, we will have returned to the middle ages."</i><br>
<p>
Very true. The desirability of continued life is a question each<br>
person must decide on, it can not and should not be decided by an<br>
outside force.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another professor (in philosophy) suggested that immortality will </i><br>
<i>&gt; result in eternal boredom. He supported this with examples </i><br>
<i>&gt; from Greek gods, who according to stories did suffer from </i><br>
<i>&gt; boredom and envied human mortality. </i><br>
<p>
Hmm, the crackpot index by John Baez lists: "20 points for every use<br>
of science fiction works or myths as if they were fact." OK, the index<br>
was intended for "scientific" arguments, but in this case I think it<br>
applies.<br>
<p>
In discussions like this it is always fun to ask why people are<br>
attracted to the western religions with their promises of eternal<br>
life. If you buy that immortality produces eternal ennui, then heaven<br>
must be worse than most conceptions of hell. Many christians would<br>
probably respond with pointing out that existence heaven is totally<br>
blessed and you cannot by definition become bored with it. But why<br>
can't we modify ourselves so that we do not become bored?<br>
<p>
A basic assumption many make is that immortality means it is<br>
*impossible* to die, regardless of how much one wants to. To be<br>
honest, the best we could ever achieve would be indefinite lifespans<br>
(i.e. no aging or other process making death unavoidable) with a very<br>
low (perhaps negligble) probability of dying in an unplanned way.<br>
