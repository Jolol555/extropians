Are you aware of organizations related to the libertarian philosophy?<br>
They are dedicated to this same principle.  As you described, libertarians<br>
support all political rights, first amendment, second amendment, etc.<br>
<p>
Are there any ways we would distinguish an Extropian activist movement<br>
from a libertarian one?  Both favor individual freedom, laissez faire<br>
economics, and absence of coercion.  That's about as far as libertarians<br>
go; that is the core which they agree on.  Once people are free of coercion<br>
libertarians are willing to accept whatever they decide to do.<br>
<p>
Extropianism goes beyond simple freedom to act.  That is a fundamental<br>
principle but there is more to it than that.  Extropian philosophy<br>
advocates not just freedom, but using that freedom in certain ways,<br>
for self improvement, for growth, for increasing your personal power<br>
and capabilities.<br>
<p>
That doesn't mean that Extropians want to force anyone to behave this way.<br>
In effect, these are recommendations.  But Extropians don't want anyone<br>
to prevent others from having the opportunity to work towards these goals.<br>
<p>
I would see an Extropian activist movement then as working for the<br>
libertarian goal of anti-coercion, but doing it in such a way that it<br>
targets technologies which give people more power to control and alter<br>
their lives.  In distributing its resources, it would work hardest to<br>
eliminate laws which did the most to impede Extropian goals.  Rather than<br>
working to eliminate bans on heroin, it would try to eliminate bans on<br>
cloning research.  Rather than supporting the right of people to burn<br>
the flag, it would support their right to choose cryonic suspension.<br>
<p>
This does not mean that these other goals are wrong, or that no effort<br>
should be expended on them.  But given that resources are limited, an<br>
Extropian activist organization should try to find causes which resonate<br>
with Extropian principles.  All forms of freedom are good, but those which<br>
especially help people to achieve self transformation, self improvement,<br>
self expansion, are the ones which an Extropian organization would be most<br>
interested in.<br>
