<p>
There would be no guarantee of their survival in a free society.  If<br>
value<br>
(as you mention later in your post) is not brought to both management <br>
and their own membership, they would merely wither away.<br>
<p>

violence <br>

<p>
If labor-purchasers have violated a contract with the union that contract<br>
should be enforceable in a court.  But legal monopoly power or violence<br>
may not be, of course, in a free society, a resort. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;or defections of labor sellers, </i><br>
<p>
Surely you don't mean by this that an individual labor seller may not<br>
withdraw from his membership in the union.  However, if the union as<br>
a whole "defects" from honoring its contract with management, that <br>
again should be enforceable in court.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;both antithetical to libertarian and extropian principles.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; . . . </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Of course, there would likely be competition in many areas between </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;multiple certification unions, but that would be completely in keeping </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;with libertarian and extropian ideals.</i><br>
<p>
I have thought much about unions in a  certification posture, but have <br>
been more influenced by the Underwriters Laboratories model.  An<br>
independent certification body is inherently less prone, though certainly<br>
not immune, to any conflict of interest.  <br>
<p>
However, I can envision an instance where a union whose membership <br>
is dwindling may certify incompetent people in order to secure <br>
immediate benefit.  While that is both fraud and, in an economic sense, <br>
short sighted (because when found out it will accelerate the downward <br>
trend of that certifying body), it will undoubtedly occur.<br>
<p>
With an independent certification body, again such as UL, there is far<br>
less likelihood that a particular laborer will have the financial<br>
resources<br>
to tempt the certification body into violating its own integrity with an <br>
improper certification.  <br>
<p>
Such a certification body might issue a printed directory of people who <br>
have passed certain standardized, and rigorous, examinations of <br>
competence at various levels of skills in various trades, with reviews, <br>
or re-examinations, required at appropriate intervals in order to <br>
demonstrate continued competency and maintain the certification.<br>
<p>
Such a directory could be updated, in printed form and/or electronically,<br>
<p>
frequently, with additions, as new candidates demonstrate proficiency, or<br>
<p>
deletions, as previously certified people are determined to no longer be <br>
capable of exercising their former proficiency (though this latter would <br>
likely generate much employment for labor attorneys).<br>
<p>
Nothing about any of this would be involuntary, nor would any state<br>
involvement be required (which, I suppose, is redundant).  <br>
<p>
The tradesman, if he chooses, could refrain from becoming certified; <br>
although he might be economically harmed by this decision, it would <br>
be his own decision.  On the other hand, if he makes the (probably)<br>
small expenditure required for certification, he could greatly enhance<br>
his future income (dare I mention that this certification would also be <br>
a source of pride to its owner?).<br>
<p>
Businesses could refrain from subscribing to the certification body's <br>
directories at their own risk.  But if they bought the directories, labor<br>
<p>
buyers would be well served since they would stand a much better <br>
chance of getting that for which they are paying.<br>
<p>
Traditional labor unions might well be hurt if labor sellers and labor <br>
buyers no longer found a use for their services, but that is saying <br>
that they no longer have any value and should fold up.  Still, if labor <br>
buyers and sellers found a use for these old organizations, then why <br>
would anyone want them to fold up?  Should anyone other than the<br>
labor buyers and sellers even be involved in this question?<br>
