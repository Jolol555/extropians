You've just re-invented a major research subject in computer science.<br>
When I was at MIT, carrying my slide rule made of a Brontosaurus<br>
thighbone, I knew people on the Automatic Programming Project within<br>
Project MAC. They were working on compilers :-)<br>
<p>
Some current VHLLs are almost magical (in the Clarkian sense) compared <br>
to the state of the art a few years ago. The software developers using <br>
them are still by and large running as fast as they can to keep up. <br>
Reasons:<br>
<p>
1. Good new applications have a tendency to breed more demand from the <br>
user community.<br>
<p>
2. In applications programming, coding time is no longer the schedule <br>
driver, if it ever was. Maintenance and rework, from faulty processes <br>
and from incomplete and shifting user requirements, are a much larger<br>
drain.<br>
<p>
Within the field, only a relatively small percentage of software people <br>
are working on new product development, while many labor away at data <br>
processing chores that do not contribute anything new. I don't see this <br>
changing either, until our machines have enough intelligence to start <br>
taking over this kind of development (how much intelligence does <br>
"Add/Change/Inquire/Delete" take, anyway? :-). Too much of this work is <br>
still being done by people who could be doing more innovative stuff, <br>
but there is a lot of uptake of "non-technical" people to do HTML,<br>
end-user database development, and so on. This is not without a <br>
downside. My former boss at MTI, a small Boston-area consultancy and <br>
software shop, used to say, "If you make programming easy enough that <br>
non-programmers can do it, the trouble is, they WILL." <br>
<p>
So, on the whole, the process you envision is happening, in an<br>
evolutionary way so far. There will be a software singularity, though,<br>
and I can see it being the leading edge of The Singularity. When AI<br>
software design agents work 24x7 on GHz machines and continually<br>
replicate and refine themselves, revolution will oustrip evolution in<br>
software development. (If I believe that, why am I not working on AI?<br>
Good damned question.)<br>
<p>
It was good to see you didn't fall into the common media misnomer of<br>
conflating semi-automatic program generators (where you have to press<br>
enter for each new program) with automatic program generators (where<br>
new programs are fired off at a high rate as long as the key is held<br>
down). <br>
 <br>
Ad Astra,<br>
