<i>&gt;Natasha, can you post the name of the program?  </i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, I don't have a TV Guide or print-newspaper, nor tv-savvy.<br>
The www.abc.com's tv scheduling doesn't list yesterday's programming.  It<br>
was on from 10pm to 11pm west coast time.  I think it was a ABC Saturday<br>
Night Special.  If found it very provocative.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Personally, I think Gloria Steinem needs to chill out. </i><br>
<p>
I don't always agree with her position on these issues.  I have disparate<br>
thoughts about her undercover work and Playboy Bunny years.<br>
Journalistically, I think she did a fine job especially in light of how<br>
women presented themselves to the world as tits and ass serving men.  On the<br>
other hand, I question the integrity of using others for one's own gain when<br>
done to undermine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The mix of </i><br>
<i>&gt;androgens/estrogen definitely affects personalities,</i><br>
<p>
Our "organs" are indeed quite affected by our chemistry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and I'm ready to </i><br>
<i>&gt;propose it as a manner of identifying gender as opposed to body </i><br>
<i>&gt;parts.</i><br>
<p>
Hormones as part of chromosomes  XX, XY, XYY?<br>
<p>
The host's (I suppose he was the journalist) commentary at the end of the<br>
program included a statement to the effect that "our" individuality is more<br>
diverse than our sexuality.  This certainly puts the assumed "group"<br>
mentality at bay.<br>
