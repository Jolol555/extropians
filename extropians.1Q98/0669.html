<i>&gt;From "New Technology Week"</i><br>
<p>
Whether it's in longer-lasting drill bits, cosmetics that block the sun as well<br>
as enhance personal appearance, or improved disk-drive heads to boost<br>
data-storage density, nanotechnology is beginning to make its mark on the<br>
American economy.<br>
But the ability of U.S. industry to fully exploit the potential of<br>
nanotechnology is not assured, according to the National Science Foundation<br>
(NSF), which is leading an effort to get researchers in universities,<br>
government, and industry to coordinate and collaborate more effectively.<br>
In the last year NSF has quietly enlisted a dozen federal research agencies in<br>
an ad hoc forum known as the Interagency Nanotechnology Group. The aim is to<br>
provide a means of tracking the wide array of basic and applied research in<br>
nanotechnology conducted in the United States.<br>
"It is essential to have a coordinated activity in nanotechnology," says Mike<br>
Roco, program director at NSF's Engineering Directorate. What the United States<br>
is up against, he notes, is targeted research efforts backed by government<br>
funding in Japan and Europe.<br>
European R&amp;D efforts in nanotechnology are supported both at a national level<br>
and by the European Union. Germany's Federal Ministry of Research and<br>
Technology is spending $50 million a year, and France is spending a similar<br>
amount. Smaller efforts are under way in the UK, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,<br>
and Russia.<br>
Government agencies in Japan also are estimated to be investing at least $50<br>
million a year in the field. In addition, there is strong support for<br>
nanoscience and nanotechnology in Japanese industry. Elsewhere in Asia, China,<br>
Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore have ongoing research efforts in nanotechnology.<br>
At present annual U.S. federal spending on nanoscience and nanotechnology is<br>
estimated at about $115 million, with about $63 million coming from NSF. Other<br>
federal agencies supporting research in the field include the Air Force Office<br>
of Scientific Research, Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, Department of<br>
Commerce, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Department of Energy<br>
(DOE), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National<br>
Institutes of Health (NIH), Naval Research Laboratory, National Institute of<br>
Standards and Technology (NIST), and Office of Naval Research (ONR).<br>
While the scope of U.S. research is diverse, it takes in basic science, as well<br>
as industry- and DOD-driven development programs, it is by no means<br>
comprehensive.<br>
"(W)e have kinds of islands of knowledge," explains Roco. "There are many<br>
experiments. We do not have good simulations and we do not have good methods to<br>
build for a given purpose or a given use."<br>
The U.S. is at a disadvantage because its research efforts in the field, which<br>
encompasses such diverse areas as biology, chemistry, and physics, can be<br>
relatively disconnected. At the same time, there are many unknowns, because<br>
physical and chemical processes often yield different results at the nanoscale.<br>
"The time has come to create the infrastructure for this field," says Roco,<br>
stressing that the U.S. needs to position itself now on the nanotechnology<br>
highway if it is going to reap big rewards in the decades to come.<br>
Indeed, he says, ensuring that an adequate foundation exists in the U.S. for<br>
exploring and utilizing nanotechnology is "the main goal that we see" for the<br>
Interagency Nanotechnology Group.<br>
What's the rush? Roco warns that if the nation's research communities don't<br>
strengthen their focus now on the technology, which he describes as one of "the<br>
most revolutionary forces in the next century," it could be difficult for many<br>
American companies to compete in the future.<br>
Nanoscience and nanotechnology cut across many industries, including<br>
pharmaceuticals, electronics, chemical production and refining, and materials.<br>
They are attracting growing research support because the technology provides a<br>
means to enhance the structure and performance of materials at the molecular<br>
level.<br>
And already there is considerable evidence that ability to control the<br>
composition of structures at dimensions of 50 nanometers or smaller can produce<br>
breakthroughs in coatings, electronic components, and biomedicine. Some<br>
estimates put the market for nanoparticles, nano-engineered materials, and<br>
other nanotechnology at more than $1 billion annually.<br>
The potential of the technology can barely be imagined, says Roco, who likens<br>
its current state to that of computers in the 1950s. "People still have doubts<br>
about this, but not the people who see the future," he says.<br>
Roco's agency apparently agrees. NSF is boosting support for nanoscience and<br>
nanotechnology by $10.6 million in fiscal year 1998. The agency allocated about<br>
$63 million in FY 1997 to science programs that directly or indirectly<br>
supported nanoscience and nanotechnology.<br>
NSF's directorates for biological sciences; computer and information science<br>
and engineering; engineering; and mathematical and physical sciences expect to<br>
award around 20 grants of $300,000 to $700,000 each. Beyond just boosting the<br>
level of research activity, the new NSF initiative is explicitly designed to<br>
start drawing scattered researchers together in collaborative R&amp;D efforts (see<br>
story on page 9).<br>
The grants program will engage other federal agencies in a novel way. In<br>
addition to the standard peer review panel, 12 federal research agencies will<br>
be able to observe and comment on project proposals. And, where appropriate,<br>
NSF may send researchers with solid proposals to other federal agencies<br>
supporting nanotechnology R&amp;D.<br>
Larry Kabacoff, a researcher at ONR's Materials Division, says the concept is<br>
innovative and constructive. Not only will it give other R&amp;D agencies an<br>
opportunity to do some cherry picking, but it also should benefit NSF, he says.<br>
"You need to have people who know why they are doing something (beyond just<br>
pursuing good science)," says Kabacoff, noting that there may be a sound basis<br>
for rejecting proposals if they have little relevance to other research or when<br>
net benefit may be marginal.<br>
Robert Shull, leader of the Magnetic Materials Group at NIST, rates NSF's new<br>
grants initiative, along with the activities of the Interagency Nanotechnology<br>
Group, as a good start at coordinating R&amp;D in the field.<br>
"We need to find out where there are big gaps in our knowledge. I know we are<br>
going to finds big holes. This field is still in its formative stages," says<br>
Shull. "What I'd like to get out of this is to identify barriers for developing<br>
things faster and getting it into industry so that we begin to see real<br>
progress."<br>
Efforts to coordinate nanoscience and nanotechnology research across the<br>
federal sector are supported by Herb Goronkin of Motorola. He suggests,<br>
however, that such efforts be restrained because the field is very young, and<br>
because it crosses so many scientific disciplines and industries. Cookie-cutter<br>
approaches to research coordination, he says, aren't appropriate for the<br>
nanoworld.<br>
Neither NSF nor the Interagency Nanotechnology Group is seeking to place<br>
limitations on research in the field, Roco says. Indeed, he contends that the<br>
interagency group just wants to help "drive the field" to assure that it<br>
develops adequately in the U.S. "You don't want to do this," he adds, "by<br>
setting a lot of formal rules."<br>
Nevertheless, Roco says, its now essential to have some sort of framework for<br>
following R&amp;D activities in the United States if nanotechnology is to get<br>
better recognition from federal research funding agencies, the Congress, and<br>
industry.<br>
In pursuit of that goal, NSF, NASA, NIH, DOE, NIST, and ONR will hold a<br>
workshop on the status of nanotechnology in conjunction with the World<br>
Technology Evaluation Center on February 10 in Arlington, Va.<br>
The group also is expected to push next year to get the White House's Office of<br>
Science and Technology Policy to focus on nanotechnology and its long-term<br>
infrastructure needs.<br>
