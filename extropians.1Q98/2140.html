<i>&gt;If I have good intelligence amplification, then I</i><br>
<i>&gt;can use it to earn enough to buy or develop better IA equipment, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;so on. My neighbor, who isn't quite as bright will still improve, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;will lag after more and more while I soar towards transcension. </i><br>
...<br>
<i>&gt;There are equalizing forces too.</i><br>
...<br>
<i>&gt;The problem is of course: are these forces</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough to keep the differences finite? I doubt it. </i><br>
<p>
There is one equalizing force that I think is very powerful: the market<br>
economy.  A relevant example is the growth of personal computers.  One might<br>
argue, even mathematically, that a company or individual with more MIPS will<br>
make more money off of that computing power, and therefor they will earn more<br>
money to buy more MIPS, and before long, most of the MIPS are in the hands of<br>
one entity.  Some thought that there would never be a need for many<br>
computers. <br>
The opposite happened.  Most of the MIPS are in the cheap computers.<br>
<p>
Design effort is paid for by sales, and this will apply to improving humans<br>
and<br>
our minds.  There is a market of billions of units for cheap human<br>
improvements.  These billions, growing exponentially in thinking and buying<br>
power, remain richer in total than any individual.  Remember also that we are<br>
talking about a market situation that would drastically alter the value of any<br>
particular group's currency, which tends to keep everyone trading amongst each<br>
other.  For instance, think of an incipient Power, temporarily getting<br>
ahead of<br>
the game and finding that the possessions and services of the mere Humans were<br>
especially cheap.  She would also be too expensive for the Humans to often buy<br>
from.  Over time, this trade imbalance would shift what I would call the<br>
"personal currency" balance back, and the Mere Humans would catch up to some<br>
extent.<br>
<p>
Bringing "up" the world with you is a selfish act, resulting in faster growth<br>
for you.  And a much more interesting world.<br>
