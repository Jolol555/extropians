Nor does it need umpteen nondisclosure agreements to enforce when its basis is<br>

<p>
I did the Forum as a four day weekend deal about 3.5 years ago with my former<br>
business partners. That intro weekend is extremely useful in getting people to let<br>
go of , or at least realize the fictional basis of, the meanings we all give to<br>
the world and everything in it, and is also good at getting people to learn to<br>
speak and think logically, rationally, and literally, which for most would<br>
probably be the first time in their lives. They are also big on personal<br>
integrity, which I can at the very least enthusiastically cheer for. I did<br>
however, find them also to be heavily marketing oriented in the same manner as<br>
Amway, and can be incredibly earnest to the point of annoyance. However, if you<br>
are into winning every argument and having the other person like you at the end,<br>
even though you walk away with all their money and clothes, I'd recommend it as a<br>
full time hobby, as I knew people in it that could use its rigid rationality<br>
combined with its meaning making on the fly to get anything they wanted.<br>
<p>
Cost for a four day weekend? At the time, as I recall, it was $600.00. Was it<br>
worth it? Two years ago I would have said that it was a waste of money. Today, I<br>
think it was about 75% worth it. Would I get into it more? Nope.<br>
<p>
A freind of mine in Seattle was raised in scientology, and being from a wealthy<br>
family, he and his siblings got the full hands on blessngs from El Ron himself. He<br>
now thinks, at age 44, that it has its useful aspects for cleaning up onself, but<br>
that the organization has been co-opted by a bunch of young turks out for nothing<br>
but their own persoanl aggrandizement. Needless to say, he and his sister were<br>
excommunicated a couple years ago (when they ran out of money).<br>
