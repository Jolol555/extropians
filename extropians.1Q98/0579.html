welfare is overrun by defectors? (Just have a stroll through the corridors<br>
of the Sozialamt, or do some field research among your friends). Don't you<br>
think that hunger _can_ be a motivating experience? Governmental monopoly<br>
is imo one of the worst monopolies imaginable. It breeds static societies<br>
which are unable to compete on the long run, and can lead to _very_<br>
painful catastrophic breakdowns. Believe me, what I am seeing right now on<br>
the street is not very pretty. Mostly, it's a result of explosive<br>
decompression of long-shielded society. Sudden power vacuum has made<br>
energetic individuals grab for economical and political resources. The<br>
resulting power structure is a mafiocracy, worsened by monopolism. <br>
<p>
There is a perfect example of failed govermental pension system right<br>
under your own nose. Several decades ago in Germany, with lots of smoke<br>
and mirrors a high-ranked criminal cheated several generations out of<br>
their pension -- yours included. Strong state artefacts as creaking<br>
conservationalism (amplified by some teutonic specifics), technological<br>
neophobia and a totally failed tax policy running rampant _plus_ random<br>
factors as a skewed population age histogram do not seem to make Krautland<br>
a good place to live for the next decades. (Nor Russia, btw, but for<br>
different reasons).<br>
 <br>
There is a spectrum of economic systems in real life: diverse brands of<br>
socialism/communism (deceased), the Scandinavian model (failed), Germany<br>
(failing)  and the U.S. (doing tolerably well) at the other side of the<br>
spectrum. Radical free market capitalism is a new thing, never tried<br>
before. Like many radical systems, it may fail. However, we would be fools<br>
not to try. <br>
