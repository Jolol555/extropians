 From:          "John Montgomery" &lt;johnmontgomery@hotmail.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;From: "Zeke Daystrom-Plus" &lt;bespin94@hotmail.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Ok Extropians,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Here is a challenge for you 'upbeat' folk.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Imagine a near-future world where the only access on to the internet is </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;through a Microsoft owned network, computer and or service.  Where the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;bulk of the backbone is run on NT servers.  Where the only browser is a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Microsoft one.  Where most of the content is filtered through Microsoft?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Sound Implausible?  Well, it is already happening at an unprescendented </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;rate.  Why should it bother you?  Because Bill Gates has shown no  qualms </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;about controlling content.  Why do you think he has bought up at a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;furious rate the rights to tons of artwork, history, and images?  What </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is moticating him to do this?  If itsn't to *control* then why?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Tell me why I should have the "warm &amp; fuzzies" about a man who seems to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be hell-bent on complete world domination?  After all if he controls the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;intenet he controls the future?  If not, why not?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;And if we should be worries about this ominous menace, what can we as </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;critical optimist do about it?</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Bill Gates capability to rapidly monopolize the very new industry of </i><br>
<i>&gt; computer software and internet browsers is simply symptom of a business </i><br>
<i>&gt; man taking full advantage of a new situation and technologies.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Government is slow to react, but has begun to see Bill Gates as a threat </i><br>
<i>&gt; and are trying to break his monopoly.  To say Mr. Gates desires to </i><br>
<i>&gt; conquer the world is not being pessimistic but instead being highly </i><br>
<i>&gt; paranoid.  I'm sure the government has it's eyes on Bill Gates since </i><br>
<i>&gt; there are many paranoid people in government. My question is will the </i><br>
<i>&gt; government in it's present form be able to keep up with the Bill Gates </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the future.  As new technologies rapidly develop, can we afford to </i><br>
<i>&gt; depend on government to restrict abuses?  As technology evolves at a </i><br>
<i>&gt; mind boggling speed, shouldn't we design a government which can keep </i><br>
<i>&gt; pace?</i><br>
<p>
At first glance it appears that software is a distinctly different <br>
field from near-monopolies of the past.  After all, Standard Oil <br>
couldn't change the definition of petroleum.<br>
<p>
But does that really apply?<br>
<p>
Let's see.  One company controlled about 90% of the market for <br>
local-area networking software only a couple years ago.  One company <br>
controlled about 90% of the market for database servers at the same <br>
time.  Both these companies are in trouble today, one of them being <br>
threatened by something that is demonstrably inferior in several <br>
regards and cannot coexist on the same network without creating <br>
stability or security issues and substantial additional <br>
network-management complexity.<br>
<p>
Apparently having a non-protected near-monopoly isn't much of a help.<br>
<p>
Suppose some company were to bring out a well-written, relatively <br>
bug-free, efficient shim so that Windows95 software would run on top <br>
of Linux... put together all necessary permissions and a good, <br>
easy-to-use installation package with Linux and their shim...<br>
