<p>
I hate to admit it, but I agree with Hara Ra.:)  Being in child abuse situations<br>
myself, it is my recollection that physical abuse only taught the child that<br>
whoever is stronger makes the rules: the grand lesson of dictators!<br>
<p>
Also, when I was hit, I never thought I was wrong, I just thought I needed<br>
to get even.<br>
<p>
In the example that Mark D. Fulwiler used, of a kid kicking a cat into<br>
unconsciousness, we should ask Why did the kid think this would<br>
"work" as a solution to not getting his way?  I think it is because the<br>
kid was spoiled already.  I've noticed that parents who abuse tend<br>
also to spoil.  They go through cycles of heavy abuse and spoiling<br>
permissiveness, often because they feel guilty about the abuse.<br>
The child then grows up with unreal expectations -- he or she does<br>
not know if any encounter will be injurious or indulgent.<br>
<p>
I believe a few books have been written on these phenomena.<br>
