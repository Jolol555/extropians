No you don't, and I don't think you ever will. It is fundamentally beyond<br>
you. How sad.<br>

Don't flatter yourself, I have better things to do.<br>

You are already making it easy, I don't have to do anything.<br>
Things don't get easier than that.<br>

<p>
You have just explained why the majority of people will never come around<br>
to your viewpoint. Thanks.<br>
<p>
As to the 'countering' of John Clark, from what I've read he seems a<br>
resonable and fun-2-be-with fellow. We certainly have some disagreements<br>
but we'll sit down, have a drink and work it out in much the same way Max,<br>
myself and others solved a difference of opinion some time ago. Though<br>
mutually respectful and open discussion.<br>
<p>
 (BTW, I wouldn't pick a fight with John Clark, I suspect he could<br>
  build a H-bomb from an old vacuumcleaner ;-)<br>
<p>
It must be really nice to be able to objectively distuinguish what a<br>
coherent worldview is.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;When you say "one is human after conception because 'something' happens</i><br>
<i> &gt;then even though they don't know what that something is," you are</i><br>
<i> &gt;misrepresenting my position. Conception initiates the development of a</i><br>
<i> &gt;self.</i><br>
<p>
No it doesn't. You just state that it does. And your entire argument<br>
continues to be based upon it. This is what makes it so weak.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I am trying to figure out how to keep millions of unborn children</i><br>
<i> &gt;(developing selves) from being coerced to death each year. I don't know</i><br>
<i> &gt;them and they are living thousands of miles away, is this a very Extropian</i><br>
<i> &gt;thing to do?</i><br>
<p>
Not untill you and me agree that they _are_ children, and we have reached<br>
no such agreement. Read the last sentence again. Is it reaching you?<br>
<p>
Welcome to the 20th century, where reality is merely today's 'agreed-upon'<br>
model and no longer ordained by God or one of his followers wearing a<br>
pointy hat.<br>

Say John, should I bring Heineken or a good Scotch? (Don't answer that,<br>
I'll bring both ;-) <br>
