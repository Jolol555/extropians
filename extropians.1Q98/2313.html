Max More wrote 3/1/98: &lt;At what point do you think fetal tissue becomes an<br>
unborn child? Since you don't qualify your statement, I assume you will say<br>
"at conception". If so, I'd like to hear the reasoning behind it.&gt;<br>
<p>
Developing our own selves is our own business.  Developing other selves is<br>
entering the political arena.  Ownership of the self is one thing,<br>
ownership of other selves is quite another.  I will take the question of<br>
when "fetal tissue" - a dehumanizing definition, as Anders said, propaganda<br>
developed against the enemy - becomes an unborn child to be equivalent to<br>
the question of when developing your own self becomes developing another<br>
self.  If this is not a one-to-one mapping, I would be interested in the<br>
reasons why it isn't.  The process of developing another self begins with<br>
conception, it doesn't matter if it's natural conception or artificial. <br>
When conception occurs is a matter of the completion of the normal full set<br>
of chromosomes within the fertilized egg.  I am not arguing for a moral<br>
absolute in the treatment of fertilized eggs, I am simply saying that any<br>
treatment becomes a political question, not an individual question and not<br>
a judicial or executive question.<br>
