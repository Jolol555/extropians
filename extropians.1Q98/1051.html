It's the entire eye that does this, although the fovea can do some <br>
rather prodigious feats.  Some people can reliable identify faces<br>
at a mile away - that would be quite a whopper of a resolution.<br>
<p>
In terms of whole-eye function.  I know one guy who can read an entire page<br>
without moving his eye.  I didn't believe it when I first saw it,<br>
but he had read the page I handed him, and he'd never read it before<br>
as I'd just written it.<br>

<p>
The brain is quite capable of it.  It has about 1 billion neurons with<br>
several trillion synapses devoted to just that function.<br>
