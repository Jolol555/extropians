Hi,<br>
<p>
it is really very surprising and gives much insight how slow the industry<br>
reacts to computer problems. The y2k issue is just one of them: It is clear<br>
that many companies underestimate the range of the problem. Yes, most modern<br>
PCs don't have any problems with the millenium, but lots of badly written<br>
business software (databases with 2-digit centuries) does. And,<br>
understandable, there are many companies who see no reason in upgrading to a<br>
fancy new GUI (Windoze 95) which is less stable, much slower and would only<br>
cost them money.<br>
<p>
The consequence is that these companies *will* upgrade (most of them, at<br>
least), but especially those who really need to will do it much too late. As<br>
a result they will use *any* software which has the "Year 2000 compliant"<br>
logo because they're so panic-stricken.<br>
<p>
Another good example for similar problems is tomorrow's raise of the VAT<br>
here in Germany. I don't even want to consider its economic consequences,<br>
but it shows how companies tend to "solve" computer problems in the last<br>
minutes. Literally -- my company will do the upgrades on some customers'<br>
business software tomorrow, and it's not forseeable whether it can be done<br>
in 24 hours. Many companies will be out of business for a few days (and<br>
maybe some forever) because of this.<br>
<p>
The whole industry is extremely slow in its reactions. Of course the cause<br>
are uneducated decision-makers, but it is impressive that this lack of<br>
education is so widely spread. Doesn't look good for the distribution of<br>
future memes.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
