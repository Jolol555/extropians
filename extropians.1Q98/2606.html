How do you know that? Whatever happened to Dynamic Optimism and such?<br>
<p>
But aside from that:<br>
Why is it so hard for some people on this list to believe that there are<br>
people on this planet who would do things not because they will benefit<br>
from them personally but because they _believe_ or _feel_ it is the right<br>
thing to do? Because they believe there are things more important than them<br>
personally (like the wellbeing of the human species as opposed to their own<br>
wellbeing). I know this can also lead to very negative things but that rule<br>
applies to all powerfull tools.<br>
<p>
Even if you yourself would never, in your entire lifetime, do something if<br>
it does not benefit you in some way would you at least accepts the fact<br>
that there are people who do? Why is that so hard?<br>
<p>
I do not mean to critizise anyone personal here, everyone must do what they<br>
feel is right, but this 'why would he do that, he doesn't get anything for<br>
it' attitude is not very positive minded IMHO. Isn't the darinwistic<br>
'struggle for life' thing something we wish to transcend? It may be<br>
impossible, but should we at least not try?<br>
