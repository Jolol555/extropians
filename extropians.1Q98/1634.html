As posted previously either here on on the transhumantech list, this group<br>
is involved in what could be termed 'culture hacking', or in the parlance<br>
of hackers: "social engineering":<br>
<p>

<p>
I just got a project proposal accepted by the group, and now its on their<br>
page. I put an initial $200 bounty on its accomplishment by anybody. The<br>
proposal is for at least 1000 copies of a popularly used operating system<br>
to be sold in which the normal splash screen that is displayed on bootup<br>
of the operating system is altered such that either the logo of a rival<br>
operating system, or simply a rock is seen as smashing through the logo<br>
normally on this splash screen. (NOTE: while the group wanted the proposal<br>
to not be brand specific, one can easily see that the best use of this<br>
would be for an Apple to smash through a Window.......) This must be<br>
reported widely in the press.<br>
<p>
Now, if any of you potential memetic engineers out there who might have<br>
the means to accomplish this goal are interested in attempting this feat,<br>
go to the RTMark page to volunteer....<br>
<p>
WARNING: attempting these acts could endanger your employment......The<br>
sponsors accept no responsibility that might accrue to  your career,<br>
reputation, criminal record, and livlihood as a result of commiting the<br>
proposed acts....<br>
