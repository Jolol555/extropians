Last night I watched The Tonight Show with Jay Leno  and also Vibe while<br>
roaring in laughter at the  jokes made about Clinton and his choice of gals.  <br>
<p>
To be frank, I am not interested in how many people Clinton has sex with.  I<br>
don't care where he does it and how he does it. I don't even care that the<br>
women are unaesthetic!  What I do care are three things:<br>
<p>
1.      His Interfering with a witness is a felony. -- BIG mistake.<br>
2.      His lying is distasteful.  -- Unhealthy problem.<br>
3.      The unabashed and blatantly crude tell-tale behavior of those who<br>
had sex with him (more likely than not because of his power) in<br>
disclosing/blabbing it to the press (more likely than not because of the<br>
money) and then the ultimate insult of acting as if they are doing something<br>
for some kind of justice or cause for "women" is an act of pretention. --<br>
Dim-sightedness!<br>
