&lt;&lt;You don't mention if you've done the exercises or not. If you do all<br>
the exercises you will be even more impressed. Two other excellent<br>
books for playing around with your viewpoint are _Shaving the Inside<br>
of Your Skull_ by Mel Ash and _Undoing Yourself_ by Christopher<br>
Hyatt.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Estacado:  please tell me more about Mel Ash!<br>
<p>
I have practiced most of the exersizes in Prometheus rising.  But the <br>
most powerful (non-drug) technique I have yet for metaprogramming is <br>
Christopher Hyatt's "Undoing Yourself".<br>
<p>
Having practiced his techniques for more than 7 years now, I have yet to <br>
find any more powerful.  I have however refined his techniques <br>
SUBSTANTIALLY.  I can now "energize" myself at any time or place I want, <br>
regardless of what I'm doing.  It's ability to reduce or eliminate <br>
anxiety and other pesky neurosies always amazes me.<br>
<p>
Over the last 5 years, I have taught over 200 people my particular <br>
technique, so anyone wishing to find out more, please feel free to <br>
e-mail me.<br>

   I think that Mel Ash studied/practiced Zen as a way to overcome <br>
alcoholism. His book _Shaving the Inside of Your Skull_ is packed<br>
full of exercises that may help you to get rid of beliefs that no <br>
longer serve you(which tends to be most beliefs). <br>
   I would be very interested in learning of your additions to Hyatt's<br>
techniques. If you found his philosophy in _Undoing Yourself_ enlightening<br>
you may want to visit <a href="http://www.neo-tech.com">http://www.neo-tech.com</a> for a more detailed<br>
philosophy concerning the potential of human beings.<br>
   Have you studied Chaos Magic? (Similar to the methods of Hyatt).<br>
