This claim sounds implausible to me. If true, this fellow beats the<br>
previous record by a massive 19 years. Does anyone know any more about<br>
the credentials of this case?<br>

(March 13, 1998 02:12 a.m. EST <a href="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</a>) -- Bir Chaudhari,<br>
reputedly the world's oldest man, likes to take it easy these days. At<br>
141, he's entitled to rest his 4-foot frame as he reminisces about the<br>
Queen -- Victoria, of course -- and talks about how he hopes to be 150<br>
someday.<br>
<p>
<p>
But how did Chaudhari make it to such an age, and how do he and the<br>
growing army of other post-centenarians manage to avoid the degenerative<br>
and killer diseases?<br>
<p>
<p>
Chaudhari, who has left his Nepalese village only twice, is at the<br>
extreme edge of an evolutionary trend. Centenarians were once a rarity,<br>
but now almost every nursing home has one and, according to the U.S.<br>
Census Bureau, about 59,000 Americans were 100 or older as of April<br>
1997.<br>
<p>
<p>
The lifespan of man has always been increasing, but the biggest changes<br>
have occurred in the last century, with improvements in both social<br>
conditions and medicine.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Expectation of life at birth has roughly doubled since the mid 19th<br>
century, from around 40 years to nearly 80 years. In the U.K., the<br>
fraction of the population aged over 65 has increased from one in 20 at<br>
the start of the century to one in six now," says Dr. Tom Kirkwood,<br>
professor of biological gerontology at Manchester University.<br>
<p>
<p>
As our lifespan has increased, the causes of death have changed. People<br>
used to die from acute illnesses, childbirth or industrial accidents, but<br>
today we die of chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart disease, and<br>
degenerative conditions like Alzheimer's.<br>
<p>
<p>
People like Chaudhari offer a beacon of hope for a longer lifespan. But<br>
there is no secret to longevity, although the genes we inherit can be<br>
helped with a better lifestyle, as research with twins who went separate<br>
ways at birth has shown. It's unlikely that one gene is responsible for<br>
aging. It's more likely that many genes are programmed to close down at<br>
certain times as part of a kind of built-in obsolescence.<br>
<p>
<p>
There is, however, no doubt that some kind of genetic input is involved<br>
and that longevity in some families is the norm. But, given that genes<br>
cannot yet be changed for longer-lasting ones, other life-extenders have<br>
to be explored, including lifestyle, diet and personality. People who are<br>
independent, stubborn and opinionated tend to live longer, according to<br>
one study. Social skills are also important -- people who have good<br>
networking skills are likely to be more content and live longer while<br>
stress and anxiety can reduce life expectancy.<br>
<p>
<p>
Lifestyle and diet are important, too. One Harvard study found the secret<br>
of longevity among a rural Greek population was in their diet --<br>
principally vegetables, fruit, cereals and olive oil. People who kept to<br>
the Mediterranean diet had a 32 percent increase in long-term survival.<br>
<p>
<p>
And elderly people who exercise regularly develop disability at a quarter<br>
of the rate of those who don't.<br>
<p>
<p>
As the millennium approaches, all the indications are that the average<br>
lifespan will continue to rise.<br>
<p>
<p>
Ian Pearson, a futurologist at British Telephone, says that "young people<br>
now will have a longer life span. Eventually it could go to 140."<br>
<p>
<p>
But, increasingly, extended lifespans will become divided into two parts:<br>
active and dependent. Only one in 12 octogenarians are now considered to<br>
be fully self-sufficient, a rate that drops even lower to 0.5 percent in<br>
centenarians.<br>
<p>
<p>
In a report on the future trends of aging, Arthur Caplan, director of the<br>
Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, says that<br>
extending lifespan will throw up ethical problems: "As medicine becomes<br>
better at rescuing imperiled lives and extending mortally threatened<br>
ones, the strain on resources will increase. Plain old human misery will<br>
also rise, as more and more of us make it to past our seventies only to<br>
meet arthritis, strokes, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's."<br>
<p>
<p>
One thing seems clear. If our lifespans are to increase, so too must the<br>
quality of that extra life, or it may simply not be worth having.<br>
