Um, economics does not say this.  Economic theory offers us many possible<br>
theories which might explain the lack of direct human capital markets.  The <br>
explanation above is only one of many.  I think a more likely explanation<br>
is that no one has paid the start up costs to try to get a market like<br>
this going.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;While this should make the economy more efficient and</i><br>
<i>&gt;everyone better off, it could also increase the inequality of wealth in</i><br>
<i>&gt;society. ... tempted to trade an expensive lifestyle now for poverty in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;future. </i><br>
<p>
Huh?  I would expect this sort of market to increase equality, by allowing<br>
people to insure against the largest risk they face: uncertainty regarding<br>
their future earning potential.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One reason extropians might be interested in the development of a human</i><br>
<i>&gt;capital market, besides that it give people choices they didn’t have</i><br>
<i>&gt;before, is that it may allow greater investment in human capital in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;scenario where this is especially risky. </i><br>
<p>
I'd say the more important benefit is to allow people to avoid poverty after<br>
an upload or AI transition.  Post-transition, their wages would be worth<br>
much less, but if they've sold some of those wages for non-wage capital,<br>
they'll suffer less a hit on total wealth. <br>
