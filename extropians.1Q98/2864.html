An Important Question<br>

This is a very important question.  Before I attempt<br>
to address it, I want to examine some examples of how<br>
tyrants plant pemes in the minds of the oppressed and<br>
then effectively "use" these minds as weapons.<br>

The "Society" Peme<br>

<i>&gt;it can. If you tell me it could, if only enough</i><br>

<i>&gt;well try and sell me on multimarketing. As I said</i><br>
<i>&gt;however, it serves as a good analysis tool in</i><br>
<i>&gt;determining how *I* will interact with society.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
After observation and introspection you may realize<br>
that you've never interacted with any so-called<br>
"society."  You have interacted with *individual*<br>
human beings (and their computers).<br>
<p>
"Society" is a moderately deep peme.<br>
<p>
Murray Rothbard:<br>
"..."[S]ociety," which is an abstraction that does not<br>
actually exist."<br>
"...[O]ne of the prime errors in social theory is to<br>
treat "society" as if it were an actually existing<br>
entity.  "Society" is sometimes treated as a superior<br>
or quasi-divine figure with overriding "rights" of its<br>
own; at other times as an existing evil which can be<br>
blamed for all the ills of the world.  The individualist<br>
holds that only individuals exist, think, feel, choose,<br>
and act..."  ('For a New Liberty')<br>
<p>
Harry Browne:<br>
"The gigantic myth called "society" that rules so many<br>
lives doesn't even exist."  ('How I Found Freedom...')<br>
<p>
Was the "society" peme planted in your brain?  Did<br>
you buy it?  Have you been helping to perpetuate<br>
and spread it in accordance with peme rule 19:<br>
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary<br>
peme purveyors) communicate -- although<br>
they may question, attack, and expose a<br>
few surface pemes -- they shall make a<br>
special effort to use deep pemes in their<br>
language -- in order to maximize peme<br>
survival and propagation?"<br>
<p>
Tyrants use the "society" peme in various ways: "It's<br>
in the best interest of society"; "It's a crime against<br>
society"; "The will of society"; "Society is the cause<br>
of his criminality"; "Society has a right to define what<br>
marriage is and what it is not"; etc.<br>
<p>
By perpetuating and spreading the "society" peme, does<br>
your mind serve as a weapon for tyrants?<br>
<p>
What I'm trying to sell you on is clearing<br>
deep pemes from your mind, and assisting<br>
others to do the same.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;     much less cover all the appeals to class</i><br>
<i>&gt;     hatred and other emotions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Mike: How could that be, it was only a</i><br>
<i>&gt;     half hour speech.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Sara: That easy Mike.  It is much easier</i><br>
<i>&gt;     to make a false statement, than to provide</i><br>
<i>&gt;     evidence to the contrary.  For instance,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     it only takes a second to claim that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     earth is flat.  But whole books could be</i><br>
<i>&gt;     written to explain how we know that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     world is round.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Mike: Ok, ok. The president appeared to</i><br>
<i>&gt;     be very concerned about our children</i><br>
<i>&gt;     and education tonight, didn't he.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Bob:  He sure did.  That was one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     most emotional and confusing parts of</i><br>
<i>&gt;     his whole speech.  The president thinks</i><br>
<i>&gt;     that by getting the taxpayers to pony</i><br>
<i>&gt;     up more money for our failing educational</i><br>
<i>&gt;     system, that people will think that 'he'</i><br>
<i>&gt;     is the one who is being generous. Ha, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;     is hardly a virtue to be generous with</i><br>
<i>&gt;     other peoples money.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Sara:  Right.  Then he thinks people will</i><br>
<i>&gt;     still fall for the idea that pumping more</i><br>
<i>&gt;     money into the educational system will</i><br>
<i>&gt;     improve it.  Like we are supposed to forget</i><br>
<i>&gt;     about all the money we pumped into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     educational system in the last 30 years?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Mike: So you don't believe that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     President really cares?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Bob: I have no idea if he cares about</i><br>
<i>&gt;     children.  But I know he cares about</i><br>
<i>&gt;     his political image, and about the 60</i><br>
<i>&gt;     million he got from the NEA.</i><br>

<i>&gt;Check out my web page: <a href="http://www.ioc.net/~allingham">http://www.ioc.net/~allingham</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Thanks, I did and I found under "Things that I<br>
like," item #1: "Anything New &amp; Different."  Well,<br>
I hope you find some of the peme material new and/or<br>
different.  Please don't be offended as a result<br>
of what follows.<br>
<p>
Your analytical thinking can certainly expose a<br>
surface peme such as "caring for children."  But<br>
have you also been communicating in accordance<br>
with peme rule 19:<br>
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary<br>
peme purveyors) communicate -- although<br>
they may question, attack, and expose a<br>
few surface pemes -- they shall make a<br>
special effort to use deep pemes in their<br>
language -- in order to maximize peme<br>
survival and propagation?"<br>
<p>
Do you really believe that a certain clever,<br>
lying trickster is "president" (so-called)?<br>
You even spell it with a capital "P" in one<br>
place!<br>
<p>
I agree with you that at a surface level the<br>
politicians have failed to fool you.  Are you<br>
willing to consider the possibility that at<br>
a deeper level they may have succeeded in<br>
fooling you in some respects?<br>
<p>
Was the "president" deep peme perhaps planted<br>
in your brain?  Did you buy it?  Have you been<br>
perpetuating and spreading it?  In this respect,<br>
has your mind been serving as a weapon for the<br>
tyrants?<br>
<p>
"Man in the street": "The Emperor is wonderful!"<br>
Violent anarchist:   "Kill the Emperor!"<br>
Typical libertarian: "The Emperor has no clothes!"<br>
Deep anarchist:      "Why do you hallucinate<br>
                     an ordinary naked man as<br>
                     "Emperor" (so-called)?"<br>
<p>
Did you read the story of the "Two Tribes"<br>
in the previous peme post?<br>
<p>
"How long would pemes survive, if political<br>
speeches were followed up by real analysis?"<br>
Are you willing to consider the possibility<br>
that, if followed by your past level of<br>
"real analysis," deep pemes will survive<br>
forever?<br>
<p>
<p>
The Other's Mind as a Weapon<br>
----------------------------<br>
<p>
There are several ways to "utilize" the minds of<br>
others as weapons to expand freedom.  The first<br>
is simply to persuade others to clear deep pemes<br>
from their minds.<br>
<p>
In the previous peme post, Joseph &lt;AnarcoCap1@aol.com&gt;<br>
demonstrated that he has cleared all or most deep<br>
pemes from his mind.  He will never again think of<br>
"political systems" in the same way, as he did before<br>
clearing out his deep pemes.  In some cases, he will<br>
*act* more effectively in relation to "political<br>
systems."  Most likely, he will also communicate<br>
differently -- he will only use deep pemes if he<br>
thinks it's necessary and appropriate (depends on<br>
the nature of his audience, in specific cases).<br>
Most likely, whenever appropriate, he will question<br>
and challenge deep pemes.  This may encourage others<br>
to also start clearing deep pemes from their minds.<br>
Thus Joseph will be using his mind to expand freedom<br>
in a way that could snowball.  He could activate<br>
the minds of others into becoming more potent<br>
freedom weapons.<br>
<p>
Similarly, "David G. McDivitt" &lt;mcdivitt@IAMERICA.NET&gt;<br>
and "Cynthia Allingham" &lt;allingham@ioc.net&gt; could<br>
make their minds more potent freedom weapons if they<br>
were to clear out their deep pemes -- the political<br>
"wheels in their heads" (as Max Stirner said).<br>
<p>
The second way to "utilize" the minds of others<br>
as potent weapons to expand freedom is to help<br>
spread the meme "terrocrat."  A "terrocrat" is a<br>
coercive political agent or terrorist bureaucrat.<br>
The word should always be used to refer to an<br>
individual human being -- or several individuals<br>
in its plural form "terrocrats."<br>
<p>
"Terrocrat" is a powerful meme that has started to<br>
spread and migrate.  Do a search of the WWW, using<br>
HotBot, for the word "terrocrat" to see how it's<br>
spreading to websites besides Buildfreedom.com.<br>
<p>
For a greater appreciation of what can be achieved<br>
with memes, see 'Virus of the Mind: The New Science<br>
of the Meme' by Richard Brodie &lt;richard@brodietech.com&gt;<br>
-- &lt;<a href="http://www.brodietech.com/rbrodie">http://www.brodietech.com/rbrodie</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
Imagine the day a politician or bureaucrat writes<br>
an article: "Why I'm not a Terrocrat!"  The terrocrat<br>
would be helping us spread the "terrocrat" meme.<br>
To that extent we would be using his mind as a<br>
potent weapon in our cause.<br>
<p>
The word "peme" could also become a powerful meme.<br>
A third way to "utilize" the minds of others is to<br>
spread the "peme" meme.  Ask a friend if she knows<br>
what a "peme" is.  If she doesn't, explain to her.<br>
Refer her to &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
Any further suggestions for "utilizing" the minds<br>
of others as potent weapons to expand freedom will<br>
be appreciated.<br>
