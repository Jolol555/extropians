	You are right, in that it is not likely.  I suppose there will<br>
always be people eating food from gardens, but as more and more <br>
preservatives are being added to our food, artificial selection will favor<br>
those with the higher tolerances for such additives.  Those who are less<br>
able to survive such chemicals will set a darwinian example, so to speak.<br>
<p>
Maybe mercury will actually be pretty tasty in five hundred years.<br>
