Bruce Sterling's Closing Speech / Computers, Freedom, and Privacy<br>
Conference '98<br>
<p>
CFP Closing Speech, Austin,  Feb 20, 1998<br>
<p>
 Literary Freeware -- Not for Commercial Use<br>
<p>
        Hi, my name's Bruce Sterling, I'm a local writer and a CFP<br>
 veteran.  I'm grateful for this chance to once again bring you<br>
 the fabulous benefits of my freelance pontifications.<br>
<p>
      When I first got involved in the computer civil liberties<br>
 scene, it was 1990.  We'd just had a Secret Service raid here in<br>
 Austin that had shut down a science fiction publisher.  This was<br>
 a strange and rude intrusion in my daily life, this was an advent<br>
 calculated to waken me from my dogmatic slumbers.   The more I<br>
 learned about this computer crime raid, the more peculiar and<br>
 significant it seemed.  I ended up writing an entire book about<br>
 it.  I was hoping the book would encourage some informed debate,<br>
 and maybe the deeper political issues behind the computer<br>
 revolution could somehow all be put straight.<br>
<p>
       Now, eight years later, almost to the day, we have these<br>
 four hundred interested and relevant parties all meeting here in<br>
 Austin to get together face to face and thrash some of these<br>
 things out.  And you can even earn legal credit for it.  This<br>
 gives me a warm sense of closure, a very fulfilled feeling.<br>
<p>
       There's plenty of thrash at CFP.  There's always a lot of<br>
 thrash.  Very interesting thrash.<br>
<p>
      Not a lot of permanent legal results, though.  If you glance<br>
 back over the past eight years and examine the whole enterprise<br>
 to date, what you see is very remarkable.  In the world of<br>
 computers, privacy, and freedom, crises go in and out of vogue,<br>
 but they are very rarely settled in any permanent legislative<br>
 way.  The only real permanence is the thrash itself.  I'd go so<br>
 far as to call this a new status quo.  Permanent technological<br>
 revolution.  Permanent thrash.<br>
<p>
     I was very intrigued by the remarkable presentation of our<br>
 first keynote speaker, Mr. Kahin.  It was a very congenial and<br>
 gentle speech:  "modest" was a word he used a lot.  I don't think<br>
 I've ever, ever heard an Administration science and technology<br>
 expert describe the aims of American government as "modest."<br>
 This was a remarkable confession this gentleman was making.   In<br>
 so many words, he said that policy development is cyberspace is<br>
 just plain too hard to do.  There are too many competing values<br>
 to achieve a workable political balance.  The Administration is<br>
 simply too overwhelmed by all this random electronic thrashing,<br>
 all this buzzing and bleeping.  So they'll simply modestly step<br>
 back and let the mighty forces of technology and private<br>
 enterprise thrash the situation out on their own.  And maybe<br>
 twenty years from now, when things calm down and get safer for<br>
 elected American politicians,  we may see some actual laws<br>
 passed.<br>
<p>
      Well, of course this statement is very good news for the<br>
 techno-libertarian post-industrial contingent.  Really, there<br>
 ought to be corks popping in the offices of WIRED magazine over<br>
 this keynote speech.  The Bay Area WIRED folks are very into all<br>
 this:  emergence, and market power, and bottom-up<br>
 entrepreneurism, and the sublime beauty of nonlinear network<br>
 economics that are profoundly Out of Control.   And let's face<br>
 it, after that stinking Decency Act debacle, a hands-off policy<br>
 smells terrific.<br>
<p>
       I think you can make some good arguments that there are<br>
 aspects of reality that governments should be very modest about.<br>
 Our keynote speaker pointed out that the real nodes in the World<br>
 Wide Web are words.  Hotlinked key words.  So this isn't merely<br>
 chips and wires that we are talking about.  This is language.<br>
 When government tries to regulate and police the structure of<br>
 language,  this is generally considered to be double-plus ungood.<br>
 There's a long tradition of restraint and modesty here.   The<br>
 First Amendment may be a local ordinance, but it's clearly served<br>
 us rather well, and the First Amendment says, "make no law."  Be<br>
 modest.  Make no law.<br>
<p>
      But point of view is worth eighty IQ points.   From another<br>
 point of view, to say that American government should be modest<br>
 in a flagship technology is a very weird thing to say.   I have<br>
 never before heard a federal official confess that some aspect of<br>
 industrial development is simply beyond the mental grasp of<br>
 government.  That it just plain moves too fast to figure out, so<br>
 we might as well throw up our hands and step back out of its way.<br>
<p>
       This is a radical admission to make.   It's very out of the<br>
 ordinary.  Rocket scientists are said to be pretty smart people,<br>
 but that didn't lead the federal government to declare that NASA<br>
 is impossible to manage politically, so that rockets should be<br>
 best left to Westinghouse and General Dynamics.  I don't think<br>
 there are many Congressmen who fully grasp quantum<br>
 chromodynamics, either.   But you would never see the<br>
 Administration say that quarks are too complex for government,<br>
 and that relativity and subatomic physics should be left to the<br>
 greater wisdom of the private sector.<br>
<p>
     But that's the Internet policy.   No actual government.<br>
 Some form of emergent self-regulating governance.   To me, that<br>
 was the core message of CFP 98.  They really are just plain<br>
 giving up.  That was the mellow, birdlike sound of the twilight<br>
 of sovereignty.  The era of big government is over; the era of<br>
 puzzled, shrunken, benignly indifferent government is at hand.<br>
<p>
      It's the giant sucking sound of abdicated responsibility.<br>
 So what fills the power vacuum?  I would argue that it is already<br>
 being filled by a different and more modern political<br>
 arrangement:  not bureaucracy, but ad-hocracy.<br>
<p>
       I believe that the best known ad-hocracy, the classic<br>
 version, and certainly the one that gets the most admiring press,<br>
 is the internet engineering task force.  These guys get plenty of<br>
 ink for their wonderful, cooperative, networking,<br>
 non-governmental, emergent, non-hierarchical way of organizing<br>
 their enterprise.   They're a role model, a paradigm even.  And<br>
 that management model seems to work pretty well on the Internet.<br>
<p>
     What do ad-hocracies look like in other contexts?  Say, a<br>
 business context.  I would argue that Silicon Valley is a giant<br>
 ad-hocracy.   You see a particularly virulent aspect of this, in<br>
 weird, market-bubble, casino-economy, Silicon Valley IPOs.<br>
 Esther Dyson wrote a quite good article about this in the New<br>
 York Times recently, in which she pointed out that many Silicon<br>
 Valley companies are basically digital paper-tigers.  They don't<br>
 actually develop and sell products.   Not even software, not even<br>
 ones and zeros.  They simply pitch high-concepts, sell stock in<br>
 the vaporware, cash out for the venture capitalists behind the<br>
 curtain,  and then they are acquired by larger firms.  If you<br>
 look for an actual industrial enterprise,  something with<br>
 deliverables and a cash flow, there's simply no there there.<br>
<p>
       Hollywood film production companies are long-established<br>
 ad-hocracies.  Show business has always been good at this.  The<br>
 entertainment industry.  The military-entertainment complex.<br>
 You're pitchforking a bunch of freelancers together, exposing<br>
 some film, using the movie as the billboard to sell the ancillary<br>
 rights, and after the thing gets slotted to video, everybody just<br>
 vanishes.<br>
<p>
      But in the political realm, I would argue that America's<br>
 most famous and powerful ad-hocracy is that nebulous entity that<br>
 our First Lady refers to as "the massive right-wing conspiracy."<br>
 And here we find our flagship industry giving an odd little<br>
 lurch.   That's the grating sound of a postindustrial iceberg<br>
 hitting us below the waterline.   It's not pleasant to have the<br>
 established order  seriously menaced and frightened by their<br>
 sense of a covert conspiracy.<br>
<p>
      I don't believe in conspiracy in the grand Joseph McCarthy<br>
 paranoiac tradition, but I do believe in a real and powerful<br>
 right-wing ad-hocracy of Clinton's political enemies.  I think<br>
<p>
 it's self-evident, it doesn't challenge my credulity.  I think<br>
 these right-wing activist people are basically very much like<br>
 CFP.  They're all on each other's Rolodexes, they're all on each<br>
 other's mailing lists, they all know each others' funding<br>
 agencies, think tanks and industrial backers.   And when<br>
 anything, no matter how far-fetched or bizarre, comes up that<br>
 might conceivably harm the President, that information is<br>
 disseminated around the country and around the world at lightning<br>
 speed.  It's data-mined, and catalogued, and embroidered, and<br>
 re-cycled, and re-circulated endlessly, and spun and spun and<br>
 spun.<br>
<p>
      The "massive right-wing conspiracy"  is what our friends at<br>
 the infowar contingent at RAND corporation like to call a<br>
 "segmented, polycephalous influence network." It's a loosely<br>
 linked, leaderless enterprise which is constructed rather like an<br>
 art movement, or a literary movement.  It doesn't have elections,<br>
 laws, bylaws, a code of ethics, a code of morals, or any kind of<br>
 brakes.   It can't be defeated militarily any more than Russians<br>
 could defeat Afghan guerrillas or Americans defeat the Viet Cong.<br>
 And this isn't merely a theoretical exercise.  The thing is as<br>
 real as dirt.  It has real power.<br>
<p>
      You don't have to stretch too far to perceive this as a<br>
 menace to democracy.  It's certainly a real and visible menace to<br>
 the established order, because it can throw sand in the works at<br>
 any of a hundred different points, and there's no headquarters<br>
 where the established order can hit back.  When the established<br>
 order hits back, it hits back with another, rival ad-hocracy.<br>
<p>
     You may have seen James Carville -- a very interesting and<br>
 significant postmodern figure -- appearing on television to<br>
 publicly declare war on the Ken Starr investigation.  I noticed<br>
 some pundits scoffing at this declaration -- "Carville thinks<br>
 he's in the bunker!  Carville thinks he's an army!  The Cajun's<br>
 off his rocker!"  This scoffing has a  very hollow sound to me.<br>
 It reminds me of Stalin asking how many divisions the Pope has.<br>
 The Pope doesn't use divisions, Comrade Stalin.  But the Pope<br>
 knows the ground in Poland, and he can put a stake through your<br>
 undead heart with no problem.<br>
<p>
     James Carville has never been elected to any office.  As far<br>
 as I can see, James Carville has no legitimate or constitutional<br>
 role in our society whatsoever.  All James Carville possesses is<br>
 a deep knowledge of the media, a gift for spin, a big Rolodex,<br>
 and a lot of people who owe him favors.   Oh, and a law degree,<br>
 too, somewhere at the bottom of the list.   But when the Clinton<br>
 Administration goes to the mattresses, this guy is the *first*<br>
 guy they call.<br>
<p>
      You're not going to see James Carville declaring large areas<br>
 of American reality off limits because they are beyond his mental<br>
 grasp.  You're not going to see James Carville declaring that he<br>
 ought to be modest, and let the info-pundits and the venture<br>
 capitalists decide what to do with digital media.  The guy will<br>
 do with digital media what he does with *all* media, bend it to<br>
 his own uses.<br>
<p>
     This is what ad-hocratic political power looks like in a<br>
 heavily mediated and thoroughly networked society.  I don't know<br>
 what you call that form of power, but it sure doesn't look like<br>
 anything I recognize from a high-school civics text.<br>
<p>
        And it's not unique to the United States.   Prime Minister<br>
 Blair has proved that it works great in Britain.  If you want to<br>
 see how it develops in another social context -- a deeply<br>
 non-American  context -- take a good look at postmodern Russia.<br>
 Yeltsin's campaign manager is a man named Anatoly Chubais, the<br>
 Carville of Russia.  This man is basically running the entire<br>
 Russian government off of his laptop.<br>
<p>
      I happen to have a very warm and kindly feeling about<br>
 literary movements.  I'd hate for the government to think that my<br>
 cyberpunk literary ad-hocracy was some kind of organized menace<br>
 against civil order, and that we should all be grilled in<br>
 Congress by an unAmerican activities committee.  It might be kind<br>
 of an honor -- for a Texan writer it would be quite an honorable<br>
 thing to walk down the trail of tears with John Henry Faulk and<br>
 J. Frank Dobie -- but I don't think this would be a political<br>
 plus for the American Republic.<br>
<p>
       But I think it can be demonstrated that ad-hocracy can be a<br>
 living menace to civil order.  Let's take the Lewinsky<br>
 wiretapping business.  For eight years I've been to CFP, and for<br>
 eight years I've heard the law and order contingent tell us that<br>
 wiretapping is the only sure weapon against mafias, dope runners,<br>
 terrorists and child pornographers.  I don't remember<br>
 Presidential sex partners being on that list, but it's getting<br>
 pretty clear to rest of us that they are way, way up there as<br>
 targets of opportunity.<br>
<p>
      Here we've got a wiretapping development that may bring down<br>
 an Administration, annul two elections, and plunge our country<br>
 into years of debilitating public shame and trauma.  You know, if<br>
 terrorists or dope dealers did us a grievous harm like that, we'd<br>
 pursue those evil sons of bitches to the ends of the earth.  But<br>
 instead it's our Justice Department, in league with a networked<br>
 rabble of oppo research freaks with a sick need to monitor and<br>
 surveill people's sex lives.<br>
<p>
      Hey, thanks a lot, Mr. Law-and-Order Body-Wire.  I'm sure my<br>
 two innocent daughters will sleep a lot safer in their beds after<br>
 you've ritually sacrificed the nation's chief executive in a<br>
 neurotic orgy of national sex panic.  After this gratifying<br>
 experience, I'm anxious to see your wiretapping powers expanded<br>
 radically, so that more American women, and their mothers, can be<br>
 turned into felons for lying about their sex lives.  You guys<br>
 need more plug-in jacks and headphones, it's important for our<br>
 nation's safety and stability.   So after you clean that prurient<br>
 filth off your tape heads, tell me just one more time why you're<br>
 so eager to have Digital Telephony.<br>
<p>
        It's very much a pattern.  National moral sex panics have<br>
 definite political advantages.   Ad-hocracies specialize in this<br>
 sort of agitation.  The Christian right specializes in provoking<br>
 reflexive loathing for homosexuality.  For years we've seen law<br>
 enforcement trumpet the terrifying menace of child pornography on<br>
 computer networks.   If a rightist adhocracy can checkmate the<br>
 king through a mini-Profumo scandal, it's going to be open season<br>
 on politician's sex lives for as far as the eye can see.<br>
<p>
         What is all this about, what's the commonality here?<br>
 It's a profoundly undemocratic process of shutting down informed<br>
 debate by cynically exploiting sexual hot-button issues.  We're<br>
 supposed to be so  panicked and stampeded by the specter of<br>
 kidporn that we somehow miss the fact that the FBI is installing<br>
 a Walkman jack in our phones.   You see, it's just plain too<br>
 complicated and technical for us to make up our minds about!  So<br>
 let's just panic!  At least we can provoke some vigorous action<br>
 that way.<br>
<p>
       There's a flipside to the government's public abdication of<br>
 competence to regulate and judge.  It's the unspeakable,<br>
 invisible, national-security underworld.  Wired Power without the<br>
 inconvenience of democracy.   The taps, the tapes, the dossiers,<br>
 ECHELON, the secret war against crypto -- none of this is<br>
 remotely democratic.  This is a frozen Cold War underworld<br>
 accountable to none.  If we can't regulate ourselves in an open,<br>
 above-board fashion, spooks traditionally expand to fill the<br>
 power vacuum.  I would argue that in a true information society,<br>
 private spookdom is bound to flourish.  We all take on a mild<br>
 flavor of spy.   The walls between spy, journalist, pundit,<br>
 spin-doctor, guru, opinion leader,  and political operative<br>
 become ever more vaporous.   Don't believe me?  Look around<br>
 yourself.<br>
<p>
       The day may come when powerful ad-hocracies abandon the<br>
 pretence of legality, and simply crush public figures to death<br>
 with the raw pressure of surveillance.  In much the same way that<br>
 Princess Di and her scandalous boy-toy were bloodily crushed to<br>
 death by the sheer pressure of tabloid harassment.<br>
<p>
      Or it may be that ad-hocracies will display some real<br>
 benefits for real-world public order.  We might see ad-hocracies<br>
 for sewage lines, or ad-hocracies for railroads and highways and<br>
 electrical power.  People have been talking electronic democracy<br>
 for quite a while now.  It looks good on paper, or maybe it would<br>
 be more accurate to say that it looks good glowing on a screen.<br>
<p>
    But where's the demo?  I've yet to see even the smallest<br>
 American town, or the smallest unit of actual functional<br>
 government, becoming fully electronic.  Virtual communities --<br>
 they don't seem to be living up to their hype.   They seem to<br>
 work just about as well as other traditional American intentional<br>
 communities.  Pilgrim pioneers, hippie communes, Amish<br>
 barn-raisings... these things are hard work.  Most Americans<br>
 prefer TVs to quilting bees.  Most Americans want to kick back in<br>
 the suburbs and have entertainment piped in.<br>
<p>
        And virtual communities have never worked out their bad<br>
 apple problem, their free rider problem.  Spam has damaged USENET<br>
 in ways that malicious hackers could only dream about.  Network<br>
 ad-hocracies are very good at forming a hostile overlay over the<br>
 deeper infrastructure.  They don't seem to be much good at all at<br>
 forming structures themselves.  Because ladies and gentlemen,<br>
 real political structures have *structure!*  They have laws,<br>
 regulations, rights, grants of citizenship, constitutions, true<br>
 faith and allegiance.   It's hard to fake all those things with a<br>
 Rolodex, an email list, and a starry-eyed sense of<br>
 techno-optimistic benevolence.<br>
<p>
     You know, the computer revolution really loves itself.  It's<br>
 all about publicity really, it's about moving data fast and<br>
 cheap, so maybe it's only natural that it gets entranced by its<br>
 own hype.  But you know, this isn't the last technological<br>
 revolution that you and I are going to witness.  When I turn my<br>
 eyes to the future, I really have to wonder what kind of<br>
 precedent we're setting here.  What kind of precedent are we<br>
 bequeathing to the organizers and attendees of "Biotech Freedom<br>
 and Privacy?"<br>
<p>
        Because you can smell that one on the wind.  You got the<br>
 medical priesthood under seige by eager entrepreneurs, tremendous<br>
 market demand, bathtub genetic sequencers, cheaper and cheaper<br>
 equipment, cloned sheep on the front page, activists like<br>
 Kevorkian and Richard Seed all ready to jump out of their<br>
 basements and carry out a propaganda of the deed....   And we<br>
 already know what outlaw pharmaceuticals look like.   These cats<br>
 aren't like computer outlaws, guys who are nine-tenths teenage<br>
 ideologue. These dope people have revenue streams bigger than<br>
 countries and they play for keeps.<br>
<p>
      I would also point out that this very week the FBI did us<br>
 the favor of busting a couple of biowar militia freaks.  There's<br>
 often some kind of loudly trumpeted FBI action during Computers<br>
 Freedom and Privacy.  Usually it's a computer bust.  This time<br>
 it's anthrax.   You can take that little chunk of data and make<br>
 of it what you may.<br>
<p>
      But maybe the next techno-revolution won't play out like<br>
 this one.  It may be that there is something unique and special<br>
 about the world of computation.  We can't seem to build permanent<br>
 structures; so maybe we're not a permanent problem.  Come the<br>
 year 2000, we may well find that some large percentage of the<br>
 planet's installed computers simply cease to work.<br>
<p>
      Computation may be America's flagship industry, but when you<br>
 see how people live in computation, they're not like the settled<br>
 aristocrats on the first class deck of the Titanic.  They're a<br>
 lot like the post-iceberg Titanic.  They have a raft called the<br>
 IBM mainframe, and then another raft called Apple II, and then a<br>
 raft called Macintosh, and then they make a frantic leap sideways<br>
 to Windows 95, dropping heaven only knows how much precious data<br>
 in the transfer.  And those who somehow fall overboard, end up<br>
 stiff and pale and bobbing in the chill dark waters of technical<br>
 obsolescence.   Maybe that's what we have to offer to the future<br>
 here at CFP.  Pundits destined to sink without a trace, our<br>
 solemn pontie all take on a mild flavor of spy.   The walls<br>
 between spy, journalist, pundit, spin-doctor, guru, opinion<br>
 leader,  and political operative become ever more vaporous.<br>
 Don't believe me?  Look around yourself.<br>
     <br>
       But you know -- I can live with that.  I prefer evanescence<br>
 to catastrophe.  When I think about all the scaremongering, and<br>
 alarm stories, and gloomy predictions about computer crime that<br>
 I've had to absorb over the past eight years, I feel very proud<br>
 of the American republic.  I think we've done an incredible job<br>
 of assimilating this technology.  When I went to CFP One, that<br>
 event was a total freak scene.  There were convicted criminals<br>
 and their arresting officers buying each other drinks in the bar.<br>
 In newpaper stories of 1990 you had to define the word "modem."<br>
 But here we are eight years later and websurfing is a genuinely<br>
 popular enterprise, it's like Monday Night Football or country<br>
 line-dancing.<br>
<p>
       I can live with hype, as long as we have a chance to keep<br>
 making new mistakes.    Sure, we've got ad-hocracies scurrying<br>
 around in the woodwork destabilizing the American democratic<br>
 process, but let's get real.   This is America we're talking<br>
 about.   It's seen hard times and hard, hard tests.  Slavery,<br>
 civil war.    Machine politics, the Tweed Ring, Tammany Hall,<br>
 Chicago in the 20s.  Jim Crow.   Watergate.   Texas state<br>
 politics.  Louisiana politics, for heaven's sake.  The railroads,<br>
 the steel mills, the robber barons.   The military industrial<br>
 complex.  We survived all that.  We look good now.  We have<br>
 resilience.  We toughed it out.  We have hope as a culture, we're<br>
 not afraid to reinvent ourselves.  We make ludicrous spectacles<br>
 of ourselves that cause civilized people to wonder if we've lost<br>
 our minds, but there's nothing new about that.  It's what<br>
 Americans always do.<br>
<p>
       Let's look at the general situation here, the big picture.<br>
 Stock market at an all time high.  Balanced federal budget,<br>
 practically kind of.  We even have patches of deflation.<br>
 Deflation!  I'm a middle-aged man and I never in my life saw<br>
 deflation, I thought it was a mythical beast.   And there's jobs,<br>
 even!  They may be burn-out jobs in the high-end sector, with<br>
 burger-flipping service jobs at the low end, but hey, at least<br>
 there's work around.  The computer industry is a very strange<br>
 flagship industry to have, but Dell is headquartered in Austin,<br>
 and Dell just set a bunch of new sales records.  It's an<br>
 industry!  The Texas oil industry smells really bad.  The Texas<br>
 cattle industry has screwflies, brucellosis and droughts.  I'm<br>
 down with this Texas chip and computer thing.  It's working out<br>
 down here.<br>
<p>
     In fact, I really suspect that this historical moment may be<br>
 a little Golden Age for our community.  Compared to what else has<br>
 been going on, and compared to what else may be coming, this<br>
 seems like a little Belle Epoque.  We're no longer so eccentric<br>
 that we seem freakish, and yet we have not yet settled down quite<br>
 so much that we've become wallpaper.  The electronic frontier is<br>
 no longer a howling wilderness, and it hasn't yet matured into a<br>
 decaying rust-belt slum.  We've really got it good!<br>
<p>
     When it's all said and done, my primary concern in the year<br>
 1998 is that we ought to be enjoying this more.  I think the<br>
 computer community just plain works too hard.  We're all wrapped<br>
 up in the eighty-hour weeks, and the piles of mounting email, and<br>
 the constantly bleeping cellphones.  We need to learn to kick<br>
 back.   We need to live less like galley slaves and more like<br>
 human beings.  We may never have it this good again.<br>
<p>
      That's why I've made it my personal goal at this CFP to try<br>
 and buy everybody a beer.  The con's over now, our beloved CFP<br>
 ad-hocracy is shutting down for another twelve months.  There's<br>
 one important thing about ad-hocracies, a charming quality they<br>
 have.   If you just get them outside of the video surveillance,<br>
 and away from their podiums and microphones, and add a little<br>
 social lubricant in the form of a couple of beers, they<br>
 spontaneously disintegrate into parties.  And I don't mean grim,<br>
 committed, political parties.  I  mean good old-fashioned<br>
 yahoo-style parties.<br>
<p>
      When you come right down to it, virtual communities are a<br>
 pretty thin and cerebral parody of actual communities.  But I can<br>
 slap a patch on that problem right now.   You're in my home town.<br>
 This is Austin.  Slackerville.  Berkeley on the Colorado.   Come<br>
 on out of the public spotlight, let's mosey on over to my house<br>
 and let our hair down.  It's not a black-tie do, it's very laid<br>
 back and Texan.   You're gonna have to twist off your own beer<br>
 caps and nibble your own chips and sandwiches, but at least you<br>
 can wear whatever the hell you want.  Expectations are low, and<br>
 the entry barriers are nonexistent.   Nancy and I will be glad to<br>
 have you.  Let's get actually communal, let's have a little<br>
 life-affirming celebration.  Let's tie one on.<br>
<p>
      So I dunno about you, but I'm outta here.  Last guy out of<br>
 the building has to log off and shut down!<br>
