So: of the top 5 countries 3 are mostly white, one is rich in oil, and one has<br>
a fair bit of oil and is right next to the US.  Of the next three one has the<br>
Panama Canal, one is mostly white, and one has oil.<br>
<p>
Cuba's weird, with the 2nd highest life expectancy and 3rd highest literary,<br>
but bottom GDP.  It used to be close to the US economy but has been Communist<br>
for 3 decades, without Nicaragua's civil war.<br>

The richest country is South Africa, which also has the most Europeans (13%).<br>
It's GDP compares favorably to similar Spanish colonies.  It was also an old<br>
Dutch colony before Britain took it over, and thus arguably doesn't belong on<br>
the English table at all.  That would leave them looking pretty poor (although<br>
Ceylon's interesting.)  But with the possible exception of Belize the others<br>
have no European population to speak of.  They were also all colonized in the<br>
18th-19th century, I belive, as opposed to the 16th-17th.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; would have to be revised: not only do those english colonies not do better</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the spanish colonies (haven't seen the french stats yet), they do</i><br>
<i>&gt; much, much worse.  And if india is the light of anything, then the world</i><br>
<p>
Much worse than the colonies where the natives were nearly totally replaced by<br>
Europeans, yes.  One could say the English sin was to exploit their subjects<br>
instead of killing or displacing them.<br>
<p>
India also has the distinction of being very large, possibly larger than all<br>
the other mentioned ex-colonies put together.  (I'm not doing that math.)<br>
The English brought low infant mortality; the Spanish brought smallpox.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; spanish colonies, and i included all the countries you mentioned.  And in</i><br>
<i>&gt; any case your separation between early and late colonisation</i><br>
<i>&gt; is bogus since Australia, New Zealand, India, Ceylon and South Africa were</i><br>
<p>
Wasn't S. Africa colonized by the Dutch earlier?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; into countries that did well and countries that didn't.  In any case, my</i><br>
<i>&gt; main point was in showing that your statement, and i quote, "If you looked </i><br>
<i>&gt; at a list of countries today that were once British colonies, and compared</i><br>
<i>&gt; them to the former colonies of other former great powers, you would find</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the former British colonies are today much more stable, and developed</i><br>
<i>&gt; economically, politically, and culturally, by and large."  Especially,</i><br>
<p>
A better comparison would use Asian or African colonies, particulary those<br>
from the 19th century.  Michael's in my killfile and I can't find his last<br>
post, but he may have been thinking of English vs. French, German, and Belgian<br>
colonies of the 19th century.  India does compare favorably in this case.<br>
Of course, almost anything out of Africa compares well.  Of African countries<br>
South Africa and Egypt are at the top -- both British.  There's at least one<br>
other country which quietly does fairly well; it'll be interesting to try to<br>
dig that one up.<br>
<p>
It shouldn't be too hard to figure out who's responsible for most African <br>
colonies: check the official language.<br>
