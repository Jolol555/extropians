Yes, of course I am talking only of genetic diversity - the very stuff <br>
which you and I *still* depend on to breath and eat.  Memetic diversity <br>
won't help us here until or unless it helps acheive the 'assembler' <br>
breakthrough..  Like I said earlier, we may escape the ecoloical <br>
instability through advance nanotechnology - either as a way to repair <br>
the damage we've done and/or to escape our biological ties altogether - <br>
in which case environmental destruction probably becomes irrelevant to <br>
our future survival.<br>
<p>

growth<br>

You make a good point here.  Keep in mind that an ecosystem as simple as <br>
a praire took thousands of years to evolve through a pregressive series <br>
of co-evolutinary and collaborative processes - soomething which may be <br>
next to impossible to replicate in a few short years.<br>

DISCALAIMER:  In the end, the Earth doesn't need saving.  The biosphere <br>
has proven itself to continue despite several ecological upsets and <br>
massive species losses.  The question remains, will humanity reach the <br>
level of technolgical self-suffiency (i.e nanotech) before any sort of <br>
possible ecological collapse takes place?<br>
