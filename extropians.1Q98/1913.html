 If it were easy to see, I'd expect lots of people to be working on it.<br>
We're discussing building atomically precise objects with several degrees<br>
of freedom for controlling their motion, with successive generations<br>
of designs being easier to use and/or able to build a wider range of<br>
objects. I presume this would eventually be used to bootstrap a diamondoid<br>
assembler at some point, but I haven't tried to analyze that step yet.<br>
<p>

<p>
 Bruce and Markus have written down some more detailed, but still quite<br>
incomplete, expanations of their ideas. I'll encourage them to put those<br>
on www.nanodevices.com (nothing worth looking at there yet).<br>

<i>&gt;These arms will be _very_ flabby.</i><br>
<p>
 Obviously stiffer arms would be nicer. My impression is that they will<br>
be good enough to push proteins into postions that will enable covalent<br>
bonds to form that would otherwise be rare. Do you have any hard data on<br>
how the flabbiness will affect this, or are you just giving a gut reaction?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But what is all this meant for?</i><br>
<p>
Building things by putting protein, dna, and eventually other<br>
things where we want them.<br>
