No, actually the anthropic principle is false.  Certain physical parameters<br>
just are.  We exist because of them, not vice versa.  And if the universe<br>
had been different, perhaps some other conscious life forms would<br>
exist and argue the same arguments. But to argue this principle is like<br>
saying the God exists because I deal a certain hand of cards and not<br>
another.:)<br>
