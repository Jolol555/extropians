last week I was again confronted with the problem of keeping the inside of<br>
my little dome-tent to an agreeable temperature while there was a blizzard<br>
going on outside (temperature someting like -25 C). I know, it's completely<br>
illogical to want to camp at 12.000 feet at newyear but humans do things<br>
because they _want_ to, not out of neccesity.<br>
<p>
Non-isolated nylon tents do little more than keeping wind and percipitation<br>
out. The difference between the out- and inside airtemperature is only a<br>
few degrees without special action. I've tried with several methods that<br>
vary in effectiveness (tips welcome):<br>
<p>
- lite the burner.<br>
  Not very good, costs a lot of fuel and generates nasty gas-<br>
  byproducts inside the tent, also the H2O condensates and forms<br>
  ice on the inside of the tent-shell during the night.<br>
<p>
- Heat a stone with the burner and place in inside the tent.<br>
  Better, still cost fuel but at least no nasty CO or H2O <br>
  vapours. Works long enhough to fall asleep.<br>
<p>
- Lite candles.<br>
  The candles in my Northern Lights lantirn burns about 8 hours, <br>
  and ups the temperature by a few degrees. It's more the <br>
  psychological effect of the warm yellow light I think, also: you<br>
  run out of candles.<br>
<p>
- Sex.<br>
  I you can still do this after 10 hours of mountaineering with <br>
  a 55-pound backback in knee-deep snow you can be on my team any <br>
  day. Actually this doesn't warm the tent at all and causes a <br>
  _lot_ of condensation but, hey, who cares.<br>
<p>
- Forget about the tent.<br>
  And buy the thickest goose-down sleepingbag you can find (mummie). <br>
  1400 gramms of down and a pertex/nylon outershell should keep you<br>
  happy 'till about 40 degrees below zero.<br>
<p>
This last option seems to be the most energy-efficient, rather expensive<br>
and also a bit boring considering some of the alternatives (It's _so_ much<br>
more fun to cook a rock ;-)<br>
<p>
In the not to distant future a nice gadget would be a portable (2 kilo's)<br>
nuclear heating device, prefferebly something that doesn't cause cancer<br>
after 1 hour of usage. Does anyone have an idea how much heat can be<br>
generated by a few ounces of plutonium (in a controllable reaction)?<br>
<p>
Even better would be a fusion-pile that uses snow/water/air as a<br>
hydrogensource, this could also be used to generate electricity to charge<br>
the battery's of my cell-phone (works very well now in the Alps) and GPS.<br>
If you're away during the hollidays you'll want to call some people and<br>
it's a real drag if you can't call the rescue-service because you drained<br>
your battery wishing everybody a happy newyear. And it's always nice to<br>
play with the GPS, see how late the sun goes down in Reykjavik on the april<br>
1st 2019 (20:15:34 @ N64.08.758-W021.54.865).<br>
<p>
Would it be (at least theoretically) possible to contain the radiation of a<br>
fusion-reaction inside an object the size of a 2-liter bottle? What kind of<br>
material would that take? No neutronium please, I don't like snowshoes as<br>
large as aircraftcarriers.<br>
<p>
Ideas anyone?<br>
<p>
Just in case I lose my sleepingbag, run out of fuel, candles and other<br>
things that_make_life_worth_living when climbing Olympus Mons on Mars<br>
(someday).<br>
<p>
Thanks in advance.<br>
Greetings,<br>
Arjen<br>
