I thought the article was pretty good.<br>

As for the split, it is old news to insiders and fellow travelers, but<br>
perhaps not to the general public or even people who've had a bit<br>
of exposure to the movement.  In fact, some people still think<br>
Objectivism is synonymous with the Ayn Rand Institute.  That<br>
would be akin to thinking science is equivalent to the Royal<br>
Society.  (The analogy is a stretch AND no offence to the<br>
RS.:)<br>
<p>
And I won't stay out of the fray because I've friends and enemies<br>
in all camps!<br>
