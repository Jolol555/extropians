Brian, you offer very sensible alternatives that are becoming the norm even<br>
today.  Clearly, the longer we live, the longer we will want to extend<br>
reproductive options.  This need not negate chronically young people to<br>
continue to have children.  (Emotional intelligence is relative and some<br>
people are well-equipped to raise children responsibly at a young age.)<br>

<p>
Very-late fertility in women is not a handicap.  Some young fertile women<br>
carry unhealthy genes and are incapable of taking a pregnancy to term.<br>
Statistics obviously show that very-late fertile women are more inclined to<br>
not develop a follicle  that can release an egg, fertile or not.  What is<br>
the handicap is not having adequate facilities and technologies to freeze ova.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Damien Broderick responds:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you want ova from the long-lived to supplant those from the young, you'd</i><br>
<i>&gt;need to persuade lots of the young to forego using their own youthful ova</i><br>
<i>&gt;and host spare gametes from the Darwinnowed old.  Plus the advantage, of</i><br>
<i>&gt;course, that youthful wombs are better able to carry healthy babies to term."</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps when Richard Seed develops ways to take an unfertilized egg and<br>
remove the genetic information from the nucleus and replace it into another<br>
nucleus ... <br>
<p>
Today and yesterday, an advantage is a healthy womb or as Damien says, a<br>
"youthful" womb.  Tomorrow there will be replacement wombs such as synthetic<br>
wombs that are far more hospitable than today's biological womb.  When this<br>
happens, (and it is just around the corner), the entire act of procreation<br>
from fertilization to delivery will occur outside the transhuman body.<br>
