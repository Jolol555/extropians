OK, I pulled the book off my shelf and figure 1.1 (p.8) shows the number of <br>
scientific journals doubling every 15 years since ~1730.  On p. 5, the author says:<br>
<p>
"Now depending on what one measures and how, the crude size of science in manpower<br>
or in publications tend to double within a period of 10 to 15 years.  The 10-year <br>
period emerges from those catchall measures that do not distinguish low-grade work<br>
from high but adopt a basic minimal definition of science; the 15-year period <br>
resultswhen one is more selective, counting only somed more stringent definition <br>
of publishedscientific work and those who produce it.  If this stringency is <br>
increased so that onlyscientific work of very high quality is counted, then the <br>
doubling period is drawn out so that it approaches about 20 years."<br>
<p>
He then lists a bunch of assorted measures and their doubling times. <br>
<p>
The book is: Derek J. de Solla Price, "Little Science, Big Science, and Beyond", <br>
published in 1966.<br>
