Sasha:<br>
<i>&gt;What about slightly more complex personality</i><br>
<i>&gt;features, such as curiosity, sociability, assertiveness,</i><br>
<i>&gt;willpower?   Are there any supplements that can safely</i><br>
<i>&gt;and selectively affect these features?  </i><br>
<p>
I don't know about curiosity, it may be an inherent trait, but the<br>
other three are considered learned traits, and referenced as 'life<br>
skills' by psychologists.  As such, they stem from the first set of<br>
factors you listed that can to some degree be enhanced through<br>
supplementation.  I would assume that if you maintained good health <br>
and mental acuity through nutrition and supplementation, you would <br>
develop more control over these more complex personality features.  <br>
