<i>&gt; The subject of first or at least early space colonies has developed out of the</i><br>

<p>
The reason why I think developing sea based enclaves now is a good idea is that it<br>
is an excellent and low cost test bed/training center for long term<br>
habitation/colonization in space. For example the figures I beleive that John<br>
Clark contributed of supertanker costs indicates that these are relatively cheap.<br>
A couple tens of millions for a whole supertanker? wow. A freind of mine built a<br>
custom sailboat in Seattle for $5 mill (125 feet). The Artemis Project, on the<br>
other hand, which proposes sending a couple people to the moon to build a small<br>
shack sized hut, plans on spending $1.5 billion.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Even tongue in cheek, there are a couple of basic questions here: "Claiming"</i><br>
<i>&gt; extraterrestrial territory or resources and what sort of launching platform,</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical and otherwise, would be needed here on Earth for such an enterprise.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As to "claiming" things off Earth, the only certain legal regime at this time</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the UN Outer Space Treaty, which clearly prohibits claims of sovereignty</i><br>
<i>&gt; over the territory in or zones of space.  This primary function of the UNOST</i><br>
<i>&gt; is an artifact of Cold War rivalry but, in the mid- to long-term may well be</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of the most important legacies of that period, keeping terrestrial nation</i><br>
<i>&gt; states out of the business of legislating off Earth as much as we could hope</i><br>
<i>&gt; for had we set up the legal regime ourselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The treaty also provides for the possibility of private ownership of resources</i><br>
<i>&gt; "extracted from" extraterrestrial objects, but makes no provision for private</i><br>
<i>&gt; territorial property.  If you're interested in these subjects, a good overview</i><br>
<i>&gt; of BASIC space law can be found in:</i><br>
<p>
However, since the US never signed or ratified this treaty, then any operations<br>
originating from the US are not bound by this treaty. This includes any launches<br>
originating from ANY U.S. posession, like the Marianas Islands, Puerto Rico, etc.<br>
Even if you launch from another site, if you 'reflag' once you get into space,<br>
then you are sitting happy. In any event, its not like the UN has any space<br>
capability of its own. How can you enforce a law when you have no means of<br>
enforcement? As recent events indicate, enforcement of UN 'laws' only occurs when<br>
the US indicates a willingness to bomb somebody. Since its not in the US's<br>
interest to enforce this particular treaty, then I doubt very much that it has any<br>
hope of ever gaining any teeth.<br>
