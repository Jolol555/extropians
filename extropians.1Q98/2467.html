<i>&gt; From:          Gregory Sullivan &lt;sullivan@blaze.cs.jhu.edu&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Michael Bowling said:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Recall in _Return of the Jedi_ when Luke meets Ben's ghost. Ben says that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Luke's father, Attican (sp?), ceased to exist when he was swayed over to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the dark side. Of Darth Vader, Ben says, "He's more machine than man--</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;twisted and evil." At the end of _Jedi_, a berserking Luke cuts off</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Vader's saber hand, and low!! it is artificial!  Luke looks at his own</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;prosthetic hand and realizes that he was becoming like his father-- more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;machine than man, spiraling enraged into the evil of the Dark Side. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a good point and illustrates that the attitude toward "machinery"</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the Star Wars trilogy is sometimes negative. Yet, two of the major</i><br>
<i>&gt; sympathetic characters are droids - 3PO and R2D2. The movies do not appear</i><br>
<i>&gt; to express a coherent theme.</i><br>
<p>
I'll disagree.<br>
<p>
The movie is neither pro-tech nor anti-tech, that is true: but then, <br>
there is no moral statement inherent in technology.  The lightsaber, <br>
an extremely high-tech weapon, is used with equal facility by good <br>
and by evil -- much as the weapons we have now are.  Droids also are <br>
used for both good and evil; so are spacecraft of all descriptions; <br>
much as various tools and transportation devices are today.<br>
<p>
For a coherent theme, then, look elsewhere.<br>
<p>
Look at the relationship between individuals and power.<br>
<p>
The Force seems to me to be an extreme religious manifestation of <br>
individual power.  Sure, some have it more than others, and some turn <br>
it to the control of others; but everybody has some, and it <br>
apparently can't be taken away from them.  The greatest master, <br>
rather than seeking the greatest control, goes off and lives by <br>
himself in a swamp.<br>
<p>
Those who seek to control others are presented as evil.  Those who <br>
seek to prevent such control are presented as good.  And with a <br>
blatant disregard of the normal terminology (since when is the <br>
daughter of a senator titled "Princess"?) the idea is carried that it <br>
is the reality and the actions, not the labels, that determine the <br>
matter.<br>
<p>
The movie was rather melodramatic, and the special effects give my <br>
daughter a headache.  But I approve of the theme.<br>
