I just realized what bothers me about this whole mess...<br>
<p>
I don't care if Clinton had an affair.  I don't see the Moral Outrage as<br>
being an important issue.  What is important (legally) is if he tampered<br>
with a witness to lie about it.  That would be criminal, etc.<br>
<p>
But if this is the case, and Clinton is guilty, what does this mean?  He<br>
is guilty of tampering with the investigation of allegations.  It<br>
totally ignores the original allegations or whether an original crime<br>
was committed.<br>
<p>
I would hate to see a President brought down as a result of his reaction<br>
to an investigation, and not due to guilt involving the original<br>
allegations that prompted the investigation.  This implies that a person<br>
can be investigated and eventually found guilty because of the<br>
investigation without any crime prior to the investigation being<br>
required.  This vaguely reminds me of entrapment, whereby the person's<br>
reaction to the police investigation is deemed criminal, and the person<br>
is charged based on this and not based on any activity occurring prior<br>
to the investigation.<br>
