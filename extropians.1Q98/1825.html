Paul:<br>
<p>
Permit me to amplify with an illustration from bionics and the current push<br>
for small (Cretaceous-period dragonfly sized and smaller) aerial platforms...<br>
<p>
When every distinguishable element of a (system) (organism) has at least<br>
two functions (ex.: frame stiffening, vertical tail surface, antenna all in<br>
one), the butterfly effect is loose.<br>
<p>
I'm rather concerned about the "race to the bottom" WRT the oceanic food<br>
web. I've noticed that Roy and Lisa Walford's excellent book on tasty CRAN<br>
cooking has more than one recipe that includes fish that are climax<br>
predators or close to it: swordfish, tuna, cod, and my favorite<br>
embarrassment, orange roughy--ehic was discovered off New Zealand just a<br>
short time ago and has been heavily fished since then.<br>
<p>
Oh, the embarrassment part? There are reports that marine biologists have<br>
determined that orange roughy probably take 25 to 35 years to become<br>
sexually mature, and may have lifespans in the wild of 125 years.<br>
<p>
Oops.<br>
<p>
Time to farm fish and let the wild oceans have a breathing spell, methinks.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;diversity would probably permit improvements to farming in the</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;comes from whatever plants fixed the carbon in the food you eat</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;- in other words, the same farm plants.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your statement strikes me as naive.  Our understanding of the complex </i><br>

<i>&gt;turn out that there is no connection.  Howerver, our you willing to risk </i><br>
<i>&gt;your survival on a hunch there is no connection between biodiversity and </i><br>
<i>&gt;the *sustainability* of farming?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;First, the so-called green revolution that we have had over the last 30 </i><br>
<i>&gt;years has come at a cost - the depletion of top soil.  Nitrogen </i><br>
<i>&gt;fertilizers have helped us grow more food, but have also accelerated the </i><br>
<i>&gt;rate at which that same land can't grow again without the introduction </i><br>
<i>&gt;of ever greater and more potent fertilizers.  It doesn't take a genius </i><br>
<i>&gt;to realize that this trend can't continue forever - there is only so </i><br>
<i>&gt;much nitrogen one can add to the soil.  What is missing is the rich and </i><br>
<i>&gt;biodiverse topsoil that must be sustained by adding to the soil exactly </i><br>
<i>&gt;what is taken away (i.e. compost).  Suprisingly very few farmers </i><br>
<i>&gt;actually practice this type of composting.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Secondly, the use of pesticides is a war that is slowly being lost.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;What is missing is a complex understanding of the *biodiversity* among </i><br>
<i>&gt;the insect community that is essential for the pollination of countless </i><br>
<i>&gt;species of edible plants.  Sustainable farmers have realized this and </i><br>
<i>&gt;have taken great measures to eliminate pesticides; and instead foster </i><br>
<i>&gt;the growth of certain populatons of insects who are vital to either </i><br>
<i>&gt;pollination or as predators to those insects who find the crops </i><br>
<i>&gt;delicious.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My point is this:  the connections between most species we have studied </i><br>
<i>&gt;are sublte yet profound (i.e. if one species goes, so do others.)  I do </i><br>
<i>&gt;not know of any connection between say a peruvian beatle and the human </i><br>
<i>&gt;community.  But my ignorance of this, is no reason to gamble on their </i><br>
<i>&gt;not being one.  As an extropian I want to expand myself *indefinitley*.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;So until I have a better undertanding of the complex web of </i><br>
<i>&gt;interconnections that is this bioshpere, I am not going to rush out and </i><br>
<i>&gt;kill some species that may turn out to be essential later for my long </i><br>
<i>&gt;term survival.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Besides, the destructiion of biodiversity is not a very extropian thing </i><br>
<i>&gt;to do as it is a net decrease in overall complexity.  Isn't extropianism </i><br>
<i>&gt;about increasing complexity?</i><br>
