Sorry if you get this twice. It does not appear on<br>
the list page so I can only assume that it bounced,<br>
I did receive several bounces that I just deleted.<br>
<p>
<p>
was: No Identity Boundary<br>

  IAN: Thanks Phil for sharing the poem with us!<br>
  I should note that,  even as I might wish that<br>
  it were so, holistic-identity theory could not<br>
  properly be considered an "extropian concept."<br>
<p>
  While I believe that most extropians are open <br>
  to the idea (as I believe intellectual tolerance<br>
  and exploration are extropian identities) and <br>
  many can see the underlying truth in holism, it<br>
  seems to me that the concept (fallacy) of "free<br>
  entity/identity" is the prevailing identity meme<br>
  among those who identity themselves as extropians,<br>
  as it is in most other "ideological" categories.<br>
<p>
  I believe that the concept of "free entity" is <br>
  exactly analogous to the concept of "free energy,"<br>
  and as such both are identically fallacies. Both<br>
  energy and identity are conserved. The energy in<br>
  subsystem X comes from energy derived by relation <br>
  to energy outside the system, and no energy in the<br>
  system comes from the system itself -- which is<br>
  to say that subsystem X does not cause new, or <br>
  "free," energy to come into existence, it only <br>
  gains from and losses energy to not-subsystem X.<br>
<p>
  The energy associated with subsystem X is never<br>
  the private property of subsystem X, it is only<br>
  "on loan" from the whole. Energy is holistic.<br>
<p>
  So too, the identity of subsystem X is derived <br>
  by relation to identity outside the system, and <br>
  no identity attribute of subsystem X comes from <br>
  subsystem X -- which is to say that subsystem X<br>
  does not cause an increase in net identity, it<br>
  only gains from and losses identity to not-subX.<br>
  It gains by difference and losses by similarity.<br>
<p>
  The identity associated with subsystem X is never<br>
  the private property of subsystem X, it is only <br>
  "on loan" from the whole. Identity is holistic.<br>
<p>
  This is simply because identity is a product of <br>
  * difference * and the difference between a thing<br>
  and itself is null, just as the energy created by<br>
  a thing is null. The difference between A and A <br>
  equals zero; so the definition of identity "A=A" <br>
  is a perfect fallacy. Where A refers to the entire <br>
  universe, we find that indeed the sum total of all<br>
  identity attributes equals zero, as I have proven<br>
  <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/matrix.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/matrix.htm</a> , just <br>
  as net universal energy equals zero. <br>
<p>
  I'm working away attempting to perfect the descrip-<br>
  tion of the holism of identity and the identity <br>
  (defined as "same as") between holistic identity<br>
  and everything: energy, force, velocity, gravity,<br>
  space-time, electromagnetic charge... Once I have<br>
  done that, perhaps people will test the idea and <br>
  see that free entity is the same fallacy as free <br>
  energy -- you cannot get something from nothing,<br>
  everything is the product of interrelating subsets.<br>
