As I continue to work on the Transhumanist Gender Site, I plan to <br>
include some information on so-called 'alternate' modes of sexuality, <br>
including polyamory, bisexuality and androgyny.  I will not, however, <br>
include pedophilia nor make any statement that it is representative <br>
of any sort of evolved relationship or sexuality.  Given that I'm <br>
making a strong statement in favor of removing some clinical <br>
definitions of abnormality that surround some sexualities, this was a <br>
tough decision, and I had some tough talks with both clinicians and <br>
the nice man/boys from NAMBLA before coming to this decision.<br>
<p>
My reasoning:  There is no need to depend upon social norms to<br>
assess the value of pedophilia.  Rational ethics supports<br>
establishing a set of criteria by which to assess a truly evolved<br>
sexual experience/relationship--let's choose the basic ones:  safe,<br>
sane, consensual, equal.  Pedophiliac sexual relationships do not fit<br>
the basic critria and often depend on the emotional or<br>
physical vulnerability of one individual.  (Note that B/D/S/M<br>
enthusiasts and polygamists have no trouble fulfilling these<br>
criteria).  Indeed, these relationships bear a strong resemblence to <br>
early forms of marriage that depended upon the female remaining <br>
ignorant, dependant and infantile.  <br>
<p>
As puberty begins to occur at earlier ages in humans, the age of<br>
consent probably could stand to be lowered by several years, but<br>
basic principles of consent and maturity remain problematic. I'll<br>
agree that some adults probably are not ready for sex and that some<br>
younger folk are, but when you plan to live for over 100 years, a few<br>
years of waiting can't hurt!<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
