<i>&gt; From:          "Grant Sparks" &lt;grant@sparks.to&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Grant, I like your attitude...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I do not live in the USA, my country has only a small fraction of the crime and</i><br>
<i>&gt; violence, so I've always though that gun control is the best way of keeping our</i><br>
<i>&gt; country from following the USA down these roads.  As a result I have always</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposed wide scale  ownership of high-powered firearms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know if I'm a better extropian for it, but Michael Lorrey has convinced</i><br>
<i>&gt; me to buy a gun and stockpile other defensive measures.  I'm still against</i><br>
<i>&gt; widespread ownership of guns, but only for *everyone else*, not for *me*.</i><br>
<p>
Watch for a study by Stephen G. Bronars (University of Texas, <br>
economics) and John R. Lott (University of Chicago, law) that should <br>
be coming out soon.  Quite a few US states have in the past decade <br>
passed laws saying that anyone who meets certain objective criteria <br>
is entitled to a concealed-carry permit -- which lets them actually <br>
carry a gun on their person, concealed, in most circumstances (the <br>
big exceptions being court facilities and places with liquor <br>
licenses, in most states.<br>
<p>
They examine crime data in these states as compared to states that <br>
have no such laws in effect, factoring national trends and <br>
demographic issues.  Their conclusion is that ready availability of <br>
concealed-carry permits causes substantial DECREASES in the rates of <br>
most crimes (pretty much everything except larceny).  I don't claim <br>
to have all the details, but one number cited in this article is a <br>
20.4% decrease in murder.<br>
<p>
At the same time, they conclude that a state NEXT TO a state with one <br>
of these laws, if it doesn't have or pass a similar law of its own, <br>
will experience an UPSWING in crime; the comparable number is a 9.4% <br>
increase in murder.<br>
<p>
Hm... 20.4% decrease here versus a 9.4% increase there... looks like <br>
a win to me.  Of course, if the "there" state decides to let people <br>
be prepared to defend themselves, that would be even better.<br>
