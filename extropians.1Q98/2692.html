Only if you choose to set it up that way; AFAIR when I installed Netscape<br>
4 (before I decided it was too bloated and went back to 3.01) I had to<br>
spend an hour or two hunting down all the different option settings to make<br>
it secure.<br>
<p>
It also doesn't neccesarily help. There's an interesting discussion starting<br>
at:<br>

of the perils of IMG tags in email, and how they can be used to trap nyms.<br>
<p>
Another example of how dangerous this could be to an individual is that I<br>
could put:<br>
<p>
&lt;IMG SRC="<a href="http://www.kiddyporn.com/nuclear-terrorist-kiddy-porn.jpg">http://www.kiddyporn.com/nuclear-terrorist-kiddy-porn.jpg</a>"&gt;<br>
<p>
in an email message and Netscape will happily go off and download the<br>
illegal image. Not only will the Feds who run kiddyporn.com have a <br>
record of your download, but your boss will see it on your screen as <br>
he walks past. <br>
<p>
Any kind of active content in email is risky, but unfortunately the<br>
trend today seems to be towards 'smart computers for stupid people'.<br>
At home I run Linux, a nice, friendly operating system which does<br>
what I tell it. At work I have to put up with Betas of Windows-98,<br>
which is continually putting up panels saying 'I really don't think<br>
you want to do that, do you?', as though it knows better than me. I<br>
have no clue as to what is going on behind the web-linked desktop<br>
nonsense, which could be uploading or downloading all kinds of things<br>
without my knowledge.<br>
<p>
To me this is troubling, because by putting the 'intelligence' outside<br>
the individual (human or SI) we have a potential for catastrophe when<br>
the computers go wrong (most obviously the current year-2000 bug issues)<br>
or someone exploits a hole in the system.<br>
