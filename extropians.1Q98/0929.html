<i>        &gt;If you look at things from the perspective of social darwinism </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why would I want to do that? Social darwinism is an old fashioned and foolish  <br>
philosophy that assumes morality can be obtained from nature. The term had <br>
not been invented in his lifetime but Darwin was certainly not a believer in  <br>
social darwinism and would have been appalled to have his name associated <br>
with  such a thing.<br>

<i>        &gt;an argument can be made that Government -- as a concept -- must have         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;been, if not beneficial, then at least a functiona, rugged, and        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;competitive concept at some time  in the past. Otherwise it wouldn't        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;be so ubiquitous today.</i><br>
            <br>
<p>
The same argument could be made of cancer. If something is evil then I'd <br>
rather it not be functional, rugged and competitive. Actually, government is  <br>
beneficial, not at the level of the individual but at a higher level of <br>
organization. Government is good for government, that's why it loves itself  <br>
and wants to grow.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I don't like facile generalisations like "government BAD" and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"free market GOOD".</i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
Good generalizations are the key to science. A good generalization, as good <br>
as any in the fuzzy world of human values and behavior is "government BAD, <br>
free market GOOD".<br>
                     <br>
<i>        &gt;What I want to know is WHY governments at the end of the twentieth         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;century have become bloated, inefficient, and counterproductive         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;monsters that are resented by many of their citizens.</i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
How could it be otherwise? Government claims power that individuals and  <br>
corporations do not have, no organization is in the habit of voluntarily  <br>
giving up power, rather they use any advantage they have to try to get even  <br>
more power.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;do you mean the concept of 'government' in general, rather than any        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;specific administration?</i><br>
                     <br>

Some shit stinks worse than others, but I don't want any on my corn flakes.<br>
