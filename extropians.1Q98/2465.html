Yes sentience is the key.  My Extropian values include sentience and<br>
consciousness high on the list.  The term "sentient being" is massivly studied<br>
in Buddhism.  If any religion can be said to be Extropian, Buddhism is the<br>
greatest in extent.  Their use of mental disciplines for higher<br>
consciousness/enlightenment, their  emphesis on direct experience and<br>
experiment rather  than dogma, and their athiest/agnostic cosmology,  are very<br>
Extropian.   <br>
Sentience is an emergent property of complex systems. The degree of sentience<br>
is a function of the system's complexity.  A just fertilized egg, dividing<br>
into 8 or 16 cells has negligible complexity and awarness.  I think pigs and<br>
dogs <br>
have some rudamentary sentience, and in Buddhist thought, certianly a fetus<br>
does. [Does a dog have Buddha-nature?  <br>
Mu!]<br>
A goal is to maximize sentience and minimize suffering.  Abortions should be<br>
minimized, used only where birth would increase suffering.  Killing of animals<br>
is unnecessary, except in emergencies,  when to not eat their meat would<br>
result in loss of human life, which is of greater sentience.    <br>
For me the Extropian position is to increase sentience, through all means,<br>
both human and machine, and reduce suffering, through medical technology and<br>
neurochemistry.<br>
The notion of the sentient being is directly related to the 'singularity' when<br>
machines readily attain human or greater intelligences.  At what point are the<br>
machines awarded the rights of "persons".  This topic is heavily the subject<br>
of science fiction [Bruce Sterling, Greg Eagen, Jean Mark Gawron etc] and at<br>
the a focal point of several Extropian beams.<br>

<i>&gt;it NOT to become a sentient being, they should be allowed to "murder" </i><br>
<i>&gt;IT, BEFORE it does. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;IMO it's even questionable if a newly born baby is a sentient being. </i><br>
<i>&gt;I get the impression that a baby, less than a couple of months old, </i><br>
<i>&gt;seems even less sentient than a dog. Furthermore it is commonly </i><br>
<i>&gt;accepted to murder pigs. And pigs are claimed to be even more </i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligent and sentient than dogs. Following this reasoning it </i><br>
<i>&gt;should also be acceptable to murder babies. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;However personally, because of emotional reasons, I think we </i><br>
<i>&gt;should draw the line at hte point at least before the moment </i><br>
<i>&gt;of birth. </i><br>
<i>&gt;And after all, I wouldn't kill a dog too (at least when I'm not </i><br>
<i>&gt;extremely hungry :-&gt; )</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The most rational way however, would be to determine for each </i><br>
<i>&gt;case separately if the baby in question has become sentient </i><br>
<i>&gt;enough to claim the right to live. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;However what is sentient enough?</i><br>
<i>&gt;And furthermore this procedure would be quite impractical and </i><br>
<i>&gt;probably not fail-proof.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;What's so special anyway about the moment of conception that a 'person'</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;begins to exist there? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I guess that most people who claim this, assume that a non-physical </i><br>
