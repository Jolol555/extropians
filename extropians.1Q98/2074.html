Alexander's e-mail just reminded me of something I heard about the other<br>
day: MAI (or Multilateral Agreement on Investment)  From what I've read, it<br>
seems this agreement will limit OECD countries' ability to legislate<br>
barriers to movement of capital or workers.  This "global constitution"<br>
will, IMO, create a much freer global marketplace, and will disallow<br>
governments to pursue their political agendas by restricting the flow of<br>
capital.  Here are some of the goodies found in the MAI:<br>
<p>
1. Countries will be required to treat foreign investors at least as well<br>
as domestic ones(regardless of the local economics situation)<br>
2. Governments will not be allowed to create or enforce laws that require<br>
investors to invest locally, or hire locally.<br>
3. Restriction on the movement of capital between countries will be banned.<br>
4. Corporations will have the right to sue countries if they violate this<br>
agreement (ie. countries get treeted like private legal entities) <br>
<p>
Apparently, the details of this treaty have been hammered out for the last<br>
3 years in secret meetings in Paris.<br>
<p>
Has anyone else heard of MAI?  Any comments?<br>
<p>
Geoff.<br>
