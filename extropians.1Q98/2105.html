Here are a few one-sentence suggestions (in descending order of personal<br>
attractiveness):<br>
1. Be a Power myself.<br>
2. Facilitate the proliferation of competing Powers.<br>
3. Undertake memetic engineering to spread some such injunction as<br>
"respect diversity," "respect rights," "abhor unecessary suffering," etc.<br>
4. Befriend the right Powers.<br>
5. Lay low.<br>

<p>
I said that whenever I hear someone claim that simplicity is important to<br>
a proper moral outlook, I think of purity, closemindedness, intolerance. <br>
You thought that this would be because I associated the value of<br>
simplicity with a lack of education.  Again, I don't think this is so.  I<br>
just think the word "simplicity" (whenever it takes on an ethical<br>
register)  sets off different associations for me than it does for you. <br>
If I had any stereotypical figures in mind here they would be evangelical<br>
Christians of the fag-hating Darwin-bashing kind or flamebreathing Randian<br>
objectivists.  Neither of these figures are necessarily uneducated in my<br>
view, tho' both seem to think that ethical truths are plainer and simpler<br>
by far than I do.  I don't know that this clarifies my reasoning<br>
particularly, but surely it will make you less confused (were you really?)<br>
about where I'm coming from.  Best, Dale<br>
