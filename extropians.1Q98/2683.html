<i>&gt; From:          Dan@Clemmensen.ShireNet.com (Dan Clemmensen)</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The Johnson and Nixon administrations prosecuted the "Chicago Seven"</i><br>
<i>&gt; on criminal conspiracy charges, even  though some of them had never</i><br>
<i>&gt; met or communicated with each other person-to-person.</i><br>
<p>
Technically incorrect.  It was the Dade County Prosecutor who <br>
prosecuted them.<br>
<p>
The charges were rioting and inciting to riot.  Neither of which is a <br>
federal offense.<br>
<p>
The verdict was consistent with the following paraphrase of something <br>
the jury foreman said:<br>
<p>
There was inciting to riot -- but Mayor Daley was the person who <br>
did it, and he was not prosecuted.  There was rioting -- but the <br>
rioters were the personnel of the Chicago Police Department, and they <br>
were not prosecuted.<br>
