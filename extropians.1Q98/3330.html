The situation is worse than this. I know of no group other than transhumanists<br>
that have a workable plan to preserve the environment. Since all other<br>
groups IMHO believe that the human condition will not change within a<br>
century, these other groups cannot put forward a viable plan that keeps<br>
humanity from destroying most remaining habitat on earth before before<br>
the year 2100, based on simple extrapolation. On the other hand, if<br>
you are willing to accept and plan for the advent of superintelligence<br>
and fully-developed molecular nanotechnology, then you can at least<br>
develop plans to preserve many ecosystems. Technologies powerful<br>
enough to preserve the environment are also powerful enough to<br>
profoundly change the human condition, probably superceding<br>
humanity with transhumanity or posthumanity or whatever you want<br>
to call it.<br>
   For one possible approach to saving the environment, see<br>
the appropriate chapters of "Unbounding the Future," which is<br>
now available on the web at <a href="http://www.foresight.org">http://www.foresight.org</a> along with<br>
a lot of other nanotech stuff.<br>
