And the low crime rate is due to... which of these parameters?  <br>
<p>
Do NH teachers force their students to study at the point of a gun?  Do NH<br>
workers negotiate their jobs at the point of a gun?  <br>
<p>
Or is violent crime elsewhere perhaps correlated with other factors that<br>
also damage education and employment rates, creating a vicious cycle?<br>
