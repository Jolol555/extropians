Eugene said:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'd vote for the reality of the first six (he did have the </i><br>
metaprogramming<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; circuit as number six rather than seven, didn't he?), but I'm pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; dubious about the others, except in the most limited sense. In many</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; respects I preferred John Lilly's model (in 'Center of the Cyclone') </i><br>
for<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the region beyond the fourth circuit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;I hope I am not commiting St. bovicide when questioning claims as to </i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;reality of existance of such circuits, their analyzability via</i><br>
<i>&gt;introspection and as of their mutability by any rituals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Besides of anecdotal, do we have any other evidence?</i><br>
<p>
Questioning the validity of such circuits is a *healthy* thing to do.  <br>
In the end they are all models of very wild and strange stuff people <br>
have experienced.  Beyond pure statistical improbability of my <br>
experiences being a conicidence I have experienced "teleportation" while <br>
asleep that correlated exactly with what I saw hours later in the waking <br>
world.  The experience was so exact that I have since kept an open mind <br>
regarding the possible existence of a Circuit 8.<br>
<p>
I like John Lilly's models of such states because he treats them more as <br>
a continuum than a discrete set like Leary's 8 circuit model.  :-}<br>
