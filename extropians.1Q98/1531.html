<i>&gt; but couldn't find any reference to extraterrestrials.  Unfortunately, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; couldn't seem to page though title 14 section 1211, it needed an</i><br>
<i>&gt; additional number (maybe paragraph?).</i><br>
<p>
Nope, you need a time machine.  14 CFR 1211 was repealed April 26, 1991.<br>
And it never actually made contact with ET illegal, it just gave NASA<br>
the authority to quarantine such "extraterrestrially exposed" persons<br>
at its discretion without hearing (pretty nasty, but no criminal<br>
record).  It was passed shortly before Apollo 11 in fear that those<br>
exposed to moon rocks might have some contagious pathogen.<br>
