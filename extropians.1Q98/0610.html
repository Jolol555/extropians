<i>&gt; : started? The government?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not money: power.  The state always expands during wartime,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and rarely if ever retreats afterward to its former size.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ("War is the health of the state.")</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To blame "Businessmen" for wars, you must ignore the fact that MOST</i><br>
<i>&gt; of them, on either side, LOSE money in wartime.</i><br>
<p>
Thats right. Tell me, where is the net economic benefit to sinking<br>
hundreds of thousands, if not millions of tons of perfectly good ships<br>
to the bottom of the ocean, to expending 50% or more of a nation's GNP<br>
with no capital gain, to destroying a large fraction, if not all of a<br>
nations infrastructure, to killing the brightest and most productive<br>
members of society???<br>
<p>
You may claim that 'stockholders' are the ones that benefit, yet why is<br>
it that 90% of weapons producers go bankrupt at the end of a major war,<br>
or are bought up by other companies at a discount??? Why is it that they<br>
take huge losses in the last year of any war, as governments fail to<br>
make payments, or cancel orders in mid production, or see their plants<br>
destroyed by enemy action?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; : Who profits from a tax policy which burdens the majority and favours</i><br>
<i>&gt; : the minority? The minority, of course. Which is not the government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hah!  Government is the most favored minority of all!</i><br>
<p>
Yes, government leaders get their names in the history books for the<br>
wars they lead, not for the peaces they oversee. How many business<br>
leaders are as famous for their wartime contributions as people like<br>
Stalin, FDR, Churchill, Hitler, Mussolini, or even generals like<br>
MacArthur, or Eisenhower, Patton, Rommel, Montgomery, Hap Arnold, or<br>
even minor heroes like Sgt. York, The Red Baron, Lt. Jack Kennedy, Jimmy<br>
Doolittle, etc.????<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; : John Clark, one of the more intelligent free market advisors, would</i><br>
<i>&gt; : answer: "If you remove governments, all this corruption will disappear</i><br>
<i>&gt; : and the free market will bring up only efficient companies." The problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; : is that by removing government, you only remove a cover under which the</i><br>
<i>&gt; : true power elite hides. The power structures remain - and before you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; : say "Jebediah", your country will be ruled directly by big enterprises.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Evidence?</i><br>
<p>
Power structures exist because of the favors of government officials.<br>
The old Quid Pro Quo is a mercantilists biggest gun. If all business had<br>
an equal footing, and if corporations were not legally considered<br>
virtual citizens, the average person would not have as much trouble.<br>
They'd have more responsibilities, for sure, but such is always the way<br>
with greater freedom.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you're right, wouldn't it be better in some ways to have the beast</i><br>
<i>&gt; made naked, so all can see its true nature?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; : Luddism is a perfectly understandable reaction in capitalism. Because in</i><br>
<i>&gt; : a capitalist society, progress in production efficiency will often hurt</i><br>
<i>&gt; : the population. The more efficient you are, the less workers you need.</i><br>
<i>&gt; : More unemployment. 4,5 million registered in Germany today, and rising.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So why did employment in the Nottingham textile industry (origin of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; term "Luddite") increase with mechanization?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course there are no state regulatory barriers to employment,</i><br>
<i>&gt; only reactionary "libertarians" believe that, right?</i><br>
<p>
Increases in productivity have ALWAYS led to greater employment at<br>
higher wages. But they have ALWAYS required a greater level of<br>
education/skill to acheive those positions. The idea of a high school<br>
grad overseeing a hundred robots doing nothing but pushing buttons and<br>
eating donuts is pure fiction. Because people are too lazy to think, and<br>
resistant to learning new things, they resist productivity increases,<br>
while claiming otherwise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; : About military: Why do you think we have it? Because some bums in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; : government think we need it to defend our country?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because military forces have been around longer than anyone can remember,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and few dare question their necessity?  I dunno, you tell us.</i><br>
<p>
Becuase some countries still make it too easy, or even welcome, leaders<br>
whos idea of leadership is to rape and pillage, make enemies, and<br>
oppress the people. The only type of diplomacy such people understand is<br>
force. An emminent example: Iraq.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; : Most extropians despise governments, but at the same time, they are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; : perfect democrats. Because they really believe that democracy works the</i><br>
<i>&gt; : way it is intended to work - they just think that this way is not right.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, let's have a show of hands.  How many here believe there's no fraud</i><br>
<i>&gt; in democracy as it is, in your respective city or country?</i><br>
<p>
People get the government they deserve. Also, egalatarians can live in<br>
an aristocratic society just fine, thank you, so long as they get to be<br>
the aristocrats.<br>
