I noticed this while driving a lot in Seattle. I'd get so ticked off at<br>
the numbskull drivers that any bumperstickers or big advertizing I saw<br>
just seemed to STICK in my mind, as did whatever songs I was listening<br>
to on the radio. It has been found in medical studies that elevated<br>
adrenaline levels increase memory retention.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The message is that by satirizing the PETA name (WHich stands for, if you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;living in a hole, "People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals") in such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;contrary</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;manner, I am a) showing total contempt for the real PETA group's message,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and b) in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;entertaining people with this satire, I am planting a counter-PETA meme that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;celebrates the carnivorous lifestyle, and humanity's position as the top</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;predator</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;on this planet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I recognized PETA, and understood your contempt for that group.  I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; see how this helps bring about the future by spreading Extropian memes.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; may be my interpretation.  I don't subscribe to the logic that says</i><br>
<i>&gt; ridiculing your opponent will make them look bad, or if they look bad you</i><br>
<i>&gt; must look good.  This probably works for much of the population, but since</i><br>
<i>&gt; the logic is faulty, I would hate to try to spread reasonable memes with</i><br>
<i>&gt; such unreasonable logic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Well, it wasn't meant as an example of spreading extropian memes, but an<br>
example of meme spreading in general. Because it is unique, and funny to<br>
the extreme for many people in this area who live a gun toting/hunting<br>
lifestyle, I have gotten a LOT of feedback. People wanting to know where<br>
to get one, etc.<br>
<p>
You don't necessarily need to make an opposing view look BAD, per se,<br>
which you would do with mud slinging type statements, which are rather<br>
passe these days for most people, but to plant an impression in people<br>
heads from the humor reinforcement so that every time they see a PETA<br>
emblem now, instead of thinking about animal testing, or fur wearing,<br>
they will think "People Eating Tasty ANimals". Every remembrance<br>
reinforces the meme, and minimizes the influence of the animal rights<br>
meme.<br>
<p>
THis isn't politics, its advertizing as a means of innoculating people<br>
against anti extropian memes.<br>
<p>
