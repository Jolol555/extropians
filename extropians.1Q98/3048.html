<i>&gt; IAN: A definition is useful IF it puts </i><br>
<i>&gt; the defined in context, IF it defines </i><br>
<i>&gt; the relations of the defined to things </i><br>
<i>&gt; that are different than it. The "A=A" </i><br>
<i>&gt; definition of A does not do that...</i><br>
<p>
I have an even stronger standard: that the identity<br>
of an can be expressed as the relationship between<br>
X and not-X is a truism that a 12-year-old could<br>
understand with a bit of reflection, and it is "true"<br>
in the metaphysical sense that it is impossible to<br>
show a counterexample, but it is /not useful/ to<br>
anyone, because It doesn't help me predict things.<br>
<p>
The symbolic string manipulations of traditional<br>
boolean algebra, starting with "A=A", are useful to<br>
prove complex theorems; /they don't mean anything/,<br>
and never have, so your rant against them is hollow.<br>
Math and Logic aren't real; they don't have to be.<br>
They are just models.  When we manipulate the models,<br>
we get predictions; when those predictions succeed,<br>
we call those models "useful".  Metaphysical truth<br>
is a mystical concept, not a useful one.  What's<br>
useful is anything that improves my ability to<br>
predict the world by reducing the information<br>
content of my world model.  The act of reason is<br>
just data compression; the simpler my model, the<br>
more I can predict with it in less computational<br>
time--given the constraint that its predictions<br>
must match my observations within the universe of<br>
phenomena in which I am interested.<br>
<p>
The fact that "crowness" is a relationship between<br>
those things that are crows and those things that are<br>
not is a true, but utterly useless, observation.  A<br>
more useful observation is to note the asymmetry in<br>
the system: there is a lot more information complexity<br>
on the non-crow side than on the crow side: think of<br>
a non-crow.  Ok, now think of a crow.  Which was<br>
easier for you, and more productive?  That asymmetry<br>
allows me to do useful work: if, for example, I store<br>
the information about "crowness"--this relationship<br>
between crows and non-crows--/as if/ it were a set of<br>
properties belonging to crows themselves, I can store<br>
the information about that relationship more compactly.<br>
Crows are black, have feathers, etc.  That simple bit<br>
of information can enable me to accomplish things<br>
like learning not to stand around dead animals if I<br>
don't want to be attacked by an angry bird. <br>
<p>
Don't tell me that holism is /true/.  I don't give a<br>
damn.  Tell me how I can /profit/ from it.<br>
