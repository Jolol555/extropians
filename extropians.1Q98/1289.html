<i>&gt; &gt; The ONLY violation of law they ever established even to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; probable-cause level, that Nixon had actually done, was participating </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in a cover-up.  THAT is what brought Nixon down.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;       That really is _preposterous_.</i><br>
<p>
It's true as stated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       Nixon's presidencies were marked by a gross contempt for law and </i><br>
<i>&gt;       ethics as well as every principle of a Constitutional Republic.  </i><br>
<p>
Nixon's presidencies were marked by a great many people other than <br>
Nixon.<br>
<p>
We know for a fact that Nixon did not break into the Watergate hotel, <br>
or into the offices of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Those were <br>
the fundamental acts behind the whole scandal.  Nixon *may* have been <br>
involved in planning either or both of those crimes; there is <br>
evidence clearly pointing to the possibility, but NOT sufficient to <br>
prove it.<br>
<p>
A great many illegal things went on in the executive branch during <br>
the Nixon administration -- many of them with the consent of Congress <br>
but that's a different argument.  Most of them were *not* related to <br>
the Watergate mess and either were not investigated at all or were <br>
not tied to Nixon himself at all.<br>
<p>
Several crimes occurred that related to the Watergate mess, but in <br>
most cases it can be positively shown that Nixon did not commit them <br>
and in many cases there is substantial doubt.  <br>
<p>
There is little doubt that he conspired to obstruct justice, <br>
obstructed justice, and destroyed evidence.  These were (in my <br>
opinion) sufficient to impeach him on and sufficient to justify his <br>
resignation (as if someone needed justification to resign).  But <br>
of all the other offensive acts that can be clearly pinned on Nixon, <br>
none that I am aware of are illegal.<br>
<p>
And those crimes Nixon was shown to be guilty of, were part of the <br>
cover-up, NOT part of the original scandal.<br>
