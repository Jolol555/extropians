<i>&gt; &gt;So I can presume from this message that there is no evidence to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;support your claims.  So granted it has no scientific basis we need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;find a rational way of looking at the current situation.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have not granted that there is no scientific basis for my </i><br>
<i>&gt; statements--they fall in line with current psychological and medical </i><br>
<i>&gt; studies and theory, and therefore I have no need to 'prove' anything. </i><br>
<p>
Consensus--even unanymity--is not a scientific basis.  But in the<br>
absense of real evidence, it's a moderately good substitute.  I'm<br>
often willing to go with consensus-based "knowledge" if I think<br>
it's not worth the effort to find real knowledge, but in this case<br>
we're talking about something people get thrown in jail for.  I<br>
think it's reasonable to demand clearer, quanititative, controlled,<br>
non-anecdotal epistemologically satisfying evidence of harm and<br>
clearer definitions of the behavior itself when dealing with crime.<br>
As compassionate human beings, we must demand that the lives<br>
destroyed by the law are absolutely necessary to prevent destroying<br>
the lives of victims, and I see precious little proof of that.<br>
<p>
The most we can say now, I think, is that most young girls who<br>
engage in sex much earlier than the norm perceive it as a<br>
negative experience; similarly, recent studies show that most<br>
young boys perceive it as a positive one (80% if I recall).  If<br>
that's the best we have, I might be comfortable looking upon an<br>
older man having sex with a young girl with suspicion, but I'm<br>
not sure I'd be willing to jail him; and I'd certainly be in no<br>
hurry to jail older women like our dear Mary Kay.<br>
<p>
I also realize you're not actively advocating that we jail these<br>
people, just declining to mention them in your site, as is your<br>
prerogative.  But I do think it is too important an issue for<br>
us as Extropians, or as human beings, to blindly accept the status<br>
quo.<br>
