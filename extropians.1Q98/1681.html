<i>&gt;If the ideas I express can</i><br>
<i>&gt;do a better job of explaining these problems than traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt;psychology then I would expect you to take them more seriously.  So</i><br>
<i>&gt;challenge these ideas, give reasons why they are not true.  Just</i><br>
<i>&gt;because something is the accepted way of explaining a problem it does</i><br>
<i>&gt;not make it the only way of explaining a problem.  </i><br>
<p>
I'll go with Ander's comments and the addition that a lot of<br>
interesting work has been done in philosophy and anthropology in<br>
navigating different mental states.  Some of it pushes the<br>
boundaries of traditional psychology, but in a sound methodological<br>
manner.  I would highly recommend Oliver Sack's book _An <br>
Anthropologist on Mars_.  <br>
<p>
That being said, we're still a far cry from recommending sexual <br>
activities prior to proper maturity, and I don't think you will find <br>
any sound research in any field to support it.<br>
