Why not add new telomeres?  People already make artificial chromosomes<br>
(YACs) with<br>
telomeres. <br>

Considering the explosion of mitotic activiy during embryonic<br>
developement, I'd think the lifespan would decrese (unless new telomeres<br>
were inserted as I sugested), if telomeres were the only factor.  How's<br>
Dolly's health?<br>
