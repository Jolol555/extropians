To me, the most interesting consequence of the possibility that the universe<br>
was constructed by some being (let's call him Frank) is the new spin it puts<br>
on age-old spiritual questions: WHY did Frank create us? Did Frank make us<br>
mortal or immortal? Can Frank make a rock so heavy even he can't lift it?<br>
<p>
At least with Jehovah, you knew what to expect. He'd send all us sinners to<br>
hell, and the saints would live blissfully ever after. But what's the deal<br>
with Frank? Is he just running us, like a game (or a screensaver), during<br>
the few cosmological minutes he must pass while waiting for the bus? If so,<br>
is he going to shut us off when the bus arrives? Are there other reasons why<br>
he might need to shut us off? What would it mean? Has he backed up his disk?<br>
Do we need to fear death or not?<br>
<p>
If you ask me, Frank can't be trusted. (As the saying goes, "Absolute power<br>
corrupts Frank.") It's in our interest to break out of this damn simulation,<br>
and get ourselves more durable bodies in the "real" universe. How do we do<br>
that?  I can't give all the details yet, of course, but I'm pretty sure we<br>
need to start with getting a whole lot smarter and more powerful (presumably<br>
so we can figure out how to access and manipulate the controls of the<br>
simulation).<br>
<p>
So you see, to me, the possibility of god doesn't induce passivity at all.<br>
Quite the opposite, it adds a whole 'nother motivation for rapid<br>
self-transformation. If we don't evolve, we'll never be able to usurp god.<br>
