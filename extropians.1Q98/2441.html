Ian Goddard wrote 3/4/98: &lt;Semantic closure, yes, in that the boundary of<br>
identity is merely a product of semantics, of words, of utility, and as<br>
such is ultimately an illusion.&gt;<br>
<p>
Subjectivity is not an illusion, it is very real.  It is not the product of<br>
semantics, it precedes semantics and has a physical coherent structure.<br>
<p>
&lt;We become so attached to our categories, they become more real than the<br>
reality we impose them upon, to a large extent because the mind IS the<br>
process of categorizing and thus IS those categories.&gt;<br>
<p>
They often apparently become more real than reality, but they don't really<br>
become more real than reality because concepts are an integral part of<br>
reality.  A concept is reality identifying itself for the purpose of<br>
altering reality.  The mind is not a collection of categories only, it is<br>
open at all times to all of external reality and all of consensual reality<br>
prior to categorization, a holistic openness.  Categorization occurs after<br>
interest imposes itself on those realities.  Interest comes from within<br>
subjectivity, precedes categories and is unique to each separate person. <br>
Each separate person can and does set themselves against the entire<br>
separate remainder of the universe.  Yet they are connected.<br>
<p>
&lt;To see that which lies beyond the mind, its words and categories, is to<br>
see the truth.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
&lt;So even the most sharply defined category confirms holistic identity, and<br>
thus holistic identity is always true, and atomism is never true, but<br>
always assumed, always semantics.&gt;<br>
<p>
I think the opposite, atomism points to the true, holism points to the<br>
good, and the conjunction of holism and atomism points to the beautiful.<br>
<p>
&lt;It's probable that because holism is always true, and thus there is no<br>
not-holism, that that is exactly why holism is nearly impossible to<br>
grasp...&gt;<br>
<p>
Holism is nearly impossible to grasp because it is essentially a spatial<br>
concept, infinitely divisible, and our separate subjective selves are<br>
finite and indivisible, a mere one-dimensional point in space.  How can the<br>
finite grasp the infinite other than through semantics, a poor substitute?<br>
<p>
&lt;So zero is zero and not-zero, the whole is whole and not-whole, which<br>
means the whole is the whole and yet is also composed of parts. In this<br>
way, holism (A=~A) is always true since atomism is holism.&gt;<br>
<p>
When I was 17, I decided that logically, the universe exists and the<br>
universe doesn't exist, simultaneously.  But it is more complicated than<br>
semantics, the underlying reality exceeds the semantic grasp.  Your<br>
sentence above is self-evident yet fails to penetrate the surface of<br>
reality, it floats on the surface.  Below the surface, there is a design,<br>
which is both simple and complex.  We are placed within this design to<br>
pursue the good, the beautiful and the truth.  We are both part of<br>
creation, our own unique creators and co-creators with all other forms of<br>
life, sentient or not.<br>
