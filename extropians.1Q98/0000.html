Umm, I believe I read an Analog speculative-fact article about foaming<br>
asteroidal NiFe into (big, you bet) lifting bodies with a reasonable<br>
(comparable to human free fall--ca. 200 MPH) terminal velocity back in the<br>
1976-1983 timeframe. Part of the idea was that any significant hull segment<br>
would have a specific gravity &lt; 1.0, so even if it broke up at sea, the<br>
pieces could be towed in. It was also claimed that aero heating should stay<br>
well below the level at which any metal would burn off. <br>
<p>
The part of the author's claim I was most dubious about was the idea that<br>
all the needed atmospheric guidance could be had by shifting the CG by<br>
moving a mass around inside the hollow airframe. Nonetheless, I thought it<br>
was cool back-of-the-envelope stuff.<br>
<p>
Of course, like any ballistic mega-engineering, it's subject to a serious<br>
NIMBY effect.<br>
<p>
(solecism side comment: I originally mistyped the phrase above as<br>
"ballsitic mega-engineering". :) )<br>
<p>
I'm sure a Reader's Guide index search would turn it up.<br>
