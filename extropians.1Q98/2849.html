I think you all are aware of recent hints towards potentially minable<br>
polar water resources on the Moon. I'd like to discuss with you a couple<br>
of the more speculative development scenarios. <br>
<p>
Obviously, due to enormous transportation costs the bootstrapping must<br>
require minimal effort -- hence it must be done by autonomous and<br>
semiautonomous (telepresence) systems. Due to relativistic delays and<br>
human iterative-control motorics telepresence will be of very, very low<br>
productivty and/or to be not very accurate. Automata must do the bulk of<br>
the job.<br>
<p>
The water content in lunar regolith (up to 2 m layer) is afair estimated<br>
to be 1-3%, which may already cause clumping. Nevertheless this is not<br>
solid bedrock, and should be relatively easy to excavate. The automata<br>
must operate in a very dark, cold environment. While there should be<br>
enough power on the supposedly constantly illuminated mountaintop to<br>
operate a largish PV array (either position tracking, or a cylindrical PV<br>
tower) and microwave (due to excellent vacuum, the magnetrons &amp; Co are<br>
reduced to a few exposed metal/isolator parts) the juice to the relay<br>
station on the twin peak facing Earth (later on, a LLO fleet of satellites<br>
could both supply power and uninterrupted communication), there won't be<br>
very much left. Of course we might contemplate a cache of hydrogen/oxygen<br>
electrolyzed from mined water to power the automata fuel cells, but<br>
isotopic batteries and a small (hey, water vapour turbines!) reactor would<br>
seem to make significantly more sense. However, a release of isotopes must<br>
be contained (free path are virtually infinite, can gravity capture part<br>
of radioisotopes of a core gone china?), the potential contamination of<br>
precious surface volatiles considered. Folks, there will be a Lunar<br>
ecology, after all. <br>
<p>
Semicontinuous operation by cryotrapping microwaved regolith exhalations<br>
is pretty trivial. The water will be dirty, probably contaminated by H_2S<br>
and NH_3. This can be later metabolized by bacteria -- nitrate is very<br>
important for hydroponics (other minerals can be autoclave-leached from<br>
regolith). Water means reaction mass: liquid oxygen and hydrogen. Water<br>
deliveries to nonpolar locations will be obviously first done by rockets. <br>
Ballistic delivery (damn sturdy containers) by EM drivers might be<br>
contemplated later on. (The age of lunatic truckdrivers has not come yet<br>
;). Water means we can do wet metallurgy (leaching, electrolysis, etc.),<br>
and hydrogen reduction. NASA has already done research on hydrogen<br>
reduction and sintering of lunar soil blocks. Magnetic separation of<br>
reduced Fe/Ni will enrichen the Al/Si/Ti oxide fraction. The need to<br>
devise new technologies from scratch (which microgravity and bone-dry (?)<br>
conditions of most FeNi and silicate asteroids would seem to imply) is<br>
unneccesary. <br>
<p>
Since we are talking &lt;&lt;1 closure of autoreplication, the devices must be<br>
reliable/redundant. The more obvious bottlenecks are rocket fuel,<br>
structure elements (bricks, glass fiber and sheet, aluminum/silicon/steel) <br>
and photovoltaics arrays. Melting can be done with a solar oven (parabolic<br>
mirror contamination by sublimates), resistance, microwave and Ebeam<br>
heating. Aluminum/silicon-sputtered glazed surface of a mineral powder can<br>
make usable improvised reflectors ready to be picked off the ground, or PV<br>
arrays. Wafer-grade silicon will be difficult to make. Otoh well worth it,<br>
for beam lithography is trivial there. Another aspect of the lunar<br>
ecology: you would like to keep the vacuum clean and hard for certain<br>
processes. <br>
<p>
Essentially, design creativity is a bottleneck. Harnessing the potential<br>
of many people working on (virtual and real) lunar simulators and<br>
teleoperated laboratories will result in a flurry of much more efficient<br>
designs, probably soon resulting in first full-closure autoreplicators.<br>
Lunar water would seem the excellent candy to lure venture capitalists and<br>
general public investments. Monkeys in vacuum suits the public can parse,<br>
the idea of space-based industry of autoreplicating automata would be much<br>
more difficult to sell. After the venture will start making profits, it<br>
won't matter anymore. <br>
<p>
If we are to establish a subselenous (thermoinsulation, radiation<br>
shielding) semiautark ecosystem, PV-fed microwave-pumped sulfur vapour<br>
light sources would seem to be best. Bootstrapping a more-or-less stable<br>
ecosystem will be difficult, starting with extremophile pioneers first<br>
would seem a good idea. Much experimenting must be done first, and I do<br>
not mean Biosystem II 'work'. <br>
<p>
Can humans work productively outdoors? First, humans are unlikely to be<br>
present at the early bootstrap stage, the necessary transportation<br>
expenses considered.  If we have a stable polar ecosystem going, humans<br>
will have to work under a constant radiation load (and nuclear reactor<br>
proximity) and darkness, under cryogenic conditions.  Current spacesuits<br>
are heavy (inertia), difficult to don, don't allow long-term untethered<br>
operation (while urination is easy to take care of, defecation is not) and<br>
vastly limit dexterity. And let's don't forget the risks, for lunar<br>
surface is no English countryside. Rapidly dockable, fuelcell-powered<br>
rubber onion-skin vacuum suits in electrically heated lead-lined<br>
tear-proof overalls (puncture kit in the pockets) might be tried out yet.<br>
Especially radiation shielding becomes very difficult here, though.<br>
<p>
I have not covered half of what I wanted to outline, but I'd rather end<br>
here. I'd like to get a constructive discussion on such speculative<br>
bootstrapping scenarios going, for the topic is obviously both rich and<br>
fascinating. Please comment. <br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
