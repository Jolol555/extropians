I’ve just finished reading 3001: The Final Odyssey, which attempts to<br>
present a world 1003 years from now.  Arthur C. Clarke fails<br>
admirably, but one line will stand out to anyone even vaguely familiar<br>
with the singularity – “Certainly, the people of 2001 who you were<br>
just watching would not feel as utterly overwhelmed in our age as<br>
someone from 1001 would have felt in theirs.”  This comes from a 3001<br>
new-millennium celebration television show.  If progress is truly<br>
exponential a person from 2001 transported to 3001 would several<br>
billion times more overwhelmed than a person transported from 1001 to<br>
2001.<br>
<p>
Even 20 years from now computers will be a millions times more<br>
powerful, you couldn’t even begin to imagine what to do with that kind<br>
of power (full sensory network Quake?)  If we just think about fully<br>
entertaining the visual senses (using ubiquitous Augmented Reality),<br>
you’ve created what any one of us would perceive as magic in 10 to 20<br>
years.  But don’t forget the rest of our sense, the ability to see,<br>
touch, smell, taste and hear anything our high power computers can<br>
generate anywhere anytime.  It wouldn’t be hard to imagine a sensory<br>
wish machine that can be completely invisible, yet read and interpret<br>
your every vocal command, movement, and gesture and seamlessly overlay<br>
whatever information you need.  Full sensory magic!<br>
<p>
Looking at politics we can already see the Internet undermining local<br>
governments, what authority they have over their small areas cannot<br>
stop globally connected citizens from accessing whatever information<br>
they want.  We are heading rapidly (more rapidly than I dare to guess)<br>
to what I see as a pre-anarchic state, where government still exists<br>
but it feeds the chaos rather than trying to impose order on it.  And<br>
everyday I hear more and more extropic thought coming from the most<br>
unlikely of places (personally I don’t think we have to worry about<br>
“spreading the word” – just be there when people start looking to<br>
further their perception.)<br>
<p>
Although I could go into reams of text about nanotechnology,<br>
biotechnology, medicine, cloning, that’s already being covered by more<br>
qualified list members in other threads.<br>

It may be bullshit, but it's inspired bullshit<br>
