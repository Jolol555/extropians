(PO) One word:<br>
<p>
Habit.<br>
<p>
Observe and consider: These were all OLD GUYS (emphasis mine but kind: I'm<br>
showing some pesky biomarkers myself). Failure of nerve becomes a habit for<br>
most people as they grow older, and so does accommodating parts of your own<br>
body and mind shutting down; furthermore, if you are suffering from a<br>
wasting disease, you become habituated to the treatment given to you by the<br>
available caregivers of today and you forget to remember that better is<br>
possible; so you opt out. Organic disthymia is of course a contributing<br>
factor--those sufferers become habituated to that neurosomatic state,<br>
regardless of age.<br>
<p>
MMB<br>
<p>
PS: EVERY/ANYBODY: Please poke holes in this--I think I'm right but I want<br>
a spirited discussion to ferret out my thinking's limitations.<br>
