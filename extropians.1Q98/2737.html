<p>
But was it *offered*, or was it *required*, to give up your child<br>
if you stayed at Falwell's place?  It's not a good idea if it's<br>
required; that's called coercion.<br>
<p>
Could you point me to the statistics that say prisons are full of<br>
single-parent children?  I know quite a few single-parent children<br>
(I'm one of them) that grew up just fine.  I feel more sorry for<br>
my mother (since she gave up *everything* for 20 years to raise me)<br>
than I do for me.<br>
