Please refrain from using such loaded words. These guys' point of debate is<br>
completely justified considering the diversity in today's world, as well as<br>
this countries own history, where boys have been considered men and girls<br>
married off at ages as low as 12-13, while today here in the US, the<br>
current furor people are having over Monica Lewinski is partly a bias<br>
against her age (21 at the time of her alleged actions with Bill( who most<br>
women consider sexy even though he's in his 50's), and now 24), as well as<br>
the current hypocritical attitude of much of the baby boom generation<br>
toward the 'genX'ers. Now that I've turned 30 this past Jan 19th, does that<br>
mean they can trust me now???? (ironic hint, hint, wink, wink).<br>
<p>
As the boomers age, I can easily imagine that they will lobby throught the<br>
AARP to deny voting rights, driving priviledges, rights to reproduce (or<br>
even keep custody of their children) of anyone under 30. Will that mean<br>
that two people having sex at age 25 in that future will be comitting date<br>
rape, statutory rape, pedophilia, or what have you??? How rational are such<br>
charges when the post is easily raised and lowered depending on the current<br>
state of the culture? Will senior psychologists promote and accept the<br>
concept that sex before 30 is a traumatic experience for 'children', and<br>
should be banned, that men who want to have sex with nubile 25 year olds<br>
are sick SOBs who should be locked up, castrated, imprisoned without due<br>
process, and be branded for the rest of their lives with the Scarlet Letter<br>
of SEX OFFENDER? Please excuse me while I puke.<br>
<p>
For someone such as you who have advocated sexual liberty to take such a<br>
puritanical position is the height of hypocritical arrogance IMHO (sorry<br>
for the ad hominem, but it is needed). I hope you see from my scenario how<br>
indicative such societal mores are of the current cultural sickness that<br>
needs treating much more than 'pedophiles' who would have been considered<br>
average citizens a few years/decades ago, and still would be in many other<br>
developed countries....<br>
