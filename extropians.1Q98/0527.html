It already happened.  You sell bits and pieces of yourself on the market<br>
all the time, in exchange for money which you can use to buy bits and<br>
pieces of other people.<br>
<p>
Every human being has finite value.  I don't see how cloning would change<br>
this at all.  Every free agent (cloned or otherwise) is fully capable of<br>
modifying their net worth as a human being.<br>
<p>
Example:<br>
	<br>
	Stephen Hawking is arguably worth more as a human being than Billy Bob<br>
Redneck.<br>
<p>
However, if Billy Bob Redneck left his trailer, went to college, and became<br>
an expert on protein design, then I would have to re-evaluate the above<br>
statement, since Billy Bob would have significantly increased his net value<br>
as a human being.  Additionally, Billy Bob would likely enjoy the benefits<br>
of his investment in his human worth, since human worth is often, but not<br>
always, tangibly reflected.  That is to say, if Billy Bob inherited 10<br>
million dollars, traded in his trailer for a mansion, but still sat in<br>
front of the TV drinking beer all day, his human market value wouldn't have<br>
changed a bit.<br>
