*very* wrong. For those ||that can't or won't do the math, think about<br>
the earth's ||sea-tides. Dawkins was not a good advert for science on<br>
that ||programme. ||<br>

<p>
====================================<br>
<p>
I am disappointed with this level of analysis.  Dawkins's reference <br>
to gravitational effects was correct.  He was referring to the <br>
instant that a person of mass x is sitting in sufficient proximity <br>
that the gravitational effect of that single mass of x is, <br>
mathematically, more important than the effect of the moon.  The sea <br>
tides reflect an entirely different, collective phenomenon.  It may <br>
be the case, for example, that while I'm in the ocean, I have a <br>
greater gravitation effect on the molecules near me than the moon <br>
does--a <br>
*tidal* effect, if you will.  But that doesn't mean that it will be <br>
as measurable as the tides.  The point is a *mathematical* one, <br>
subtle and correct.<br>
<p>
Astrology is a dead horse, I agree.  It shouldn't be taking up the <br>
valuable time of a thinker as powerful as Dawkins.  But he is <br>
performing a valuable service by debunking pseudo-science in a <br>
popular forum.  Extropians should whole-heartedly support that <br>
effort.<br>
