A somewhat extropian comic book out now is _Transmetropolitan_ (DC,<br>
Helix label.)  It's focused on Spider Jerusalem, a journalist in The<br>
City in the future, year intelligently avoided.  It has all the goodies<br>
without a Singularity: cryonic revivals, body morphing (the first issues<br>
deal with people with alien DNA), genetic engineering (two-headed,<br>
cigarette smoking, fairly smart cat), intelligence enhancing drugs, a<br>
President whose Secret Service are charging him privately, pervasive<br>
networked computers, utility fogs.  The book has been called cyberpunk<br>
but I don't think I've seen any of the classic cyberpunk elements;<br>
people just don't know their SF.<br>
<p>
First three issues are Spider returning to the City, and covering the<br>
alien-DNA people.  I don't know how the aliens (Streiber style) got to<br>
Earth, but apparently they're pretty poor; all they have to sell are<br>
cultural artifacts and their own genes.  The Cat is found.<br>
<p>
The seventh issue features people being 'downloaded' into 'foglets' --<br>
what we could call being 'uploaded' into a 'utility fog'.  Except the<br>
foglets might be the components, the people called foglet people.  I<br>
think the verb switch may make sense, if it was chosen by the foglet<br>
people, not the meat-people, who after all are dead once they've<br>
uploaded.<br>
<p>
The eighth issue deals with cryonics revivals, who all go into shock<br>
upon seeing the City.  So there is a horizon Singularity in effect, but<br>
no one's called it that.  All the current people regard things as<br>
normal.<br>
<p>
Violence is high by my standards, but low by most comics, I'd guess.<br>
Writing and artwork seem good.  And it's fun having a trans-city as<br>
background.<br>
