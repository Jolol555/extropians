<i>&gt; From:          Charlie Stross &lt;charlie@antipope.org&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are, 'less I'm mistaken, three policies for punishment in most</i><br>
<i>&gt; societies: deterrence, revenge, and prevention. These are usually applied</i><br>
<i>&gt; in combination, rather than in isolation, and the mechanism by which </i><br>
<i>&gt; they are applied, and severity, varies.</i><br>
<p>
There *should* be a fourth item in the list: reparation.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, your failure to mention it is entirely correct.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Firstly, deterrence. This is pretty much disproven as an approach to</i><br>
<i>&gt; preventing crime; punishment doesn't deter criminals because criminals</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't expect to be caught and punished. If they did, they wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; commit crimes.</i><br>
<p>
Deterrence has been shown to be somewhat effective when an <br>
intelligent person would rationally expect to be caught.<br>
<p>
Today in the US, your chances of being caught rest not on how much <br>
damage you do, but on how directly you violate government usurpations <br>
of power.<br>
<p>
The government performing its proper function would prohibit burglary <br>
and mugging; commit those crimes, you probably won't get caught.<br>
<p>
The government performing its proper function would NOT prohibit <br>
buying marijuana, and wouldn't be collecting a personal income tax at <br>
all.  Try to buy marijuana, or scrimp a bit on your income taxes, and <br>
your chances of getting caught are vastly higher than if you merely <br>
mug somebody in the street.<br>
<p>
Some studies seem to indicate that the arrest rate (assuming they <br>
only arrest people they have a good chance of being able to <br>
successfully prosecute) is the most relevant factor, that the <br>
severity of the punishment is almost irrelevant to deterrence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The classic study of this problem was conducted in England</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the victorian period. The death penalty by hanging was carried out in</i><br>
<i>&gt; public until roughly 1860, when executions were moved indoors. A study</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the 1860's and 1870's demonstrated that something like 95% of criminals</i><br>
<i>&gt; condemned to death had, however, witnessed a public execution for the very</i><br>
<i>&gt; crime they wer to hang for. The deterrent had failed, in their cases. (We</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know how many people _were_ deterred, of course, but there are other</i><br>
<i>&gt; studies of countries which abolished the death penalty and didn't experience</i><br>
<i>&gt; a sudden surge in the murder rate that suggest the same principle applies.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Arguably this is due to incorrect risk evaluation on the part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; criminally inclined; here in the UK there's a massive program of placing</i><br>
<i>&gt; CCTV cameras in public places, and it does indeed appear to have a major</i><br>
<i>&gt; impact on petty crime (vandalism, car theft, muggings) in public places</i><br>
<i>&gt; overlooked by cameras. The point being that the punishment doesn't deter</i><br>
<i>&gt; criminals; it's the certainly of capture that deters them.</i><br>
<p>
But being caught would be little deterrent, if no punishment <br>
followed.  <br>
<p>
	"Aha, you scum!  I have caught you red-handed mugging this <br>
man!  Put your knife away and leave, now!"<br>
	"Okay, guv'nor.  Same time tomorrow night?"<br>
