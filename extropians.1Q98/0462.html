&lt;&lt;The idea that our universe was created by an intelligent being is very<br>
attractive to most people.  Of course, that intelligent being could have<br>
many possible characteristics and motivations.  Many atheists continue to<br>
use the tired argument, "if there is a God, why all the suffering?",<br>
without realizing that there is no connection between creating a universe<br>
and ensuring that no suffering occurs within that system.  They have<br>
placed the unnecessary restriction that God must care about suffering and<br>
is able to do anything about it.  That's also true for their arguments<br>
regarding omnipotence or omniscience.  *Some* people's Gods have those<br>
qualities, but not every God concept includes God being omnipotent and<br>
omniscient.  <br>
<p>
When atheists state there is no God, they are making a very bold,<br>
unsupported claim, since there are so many possible variations on the God<br>
concept.  I don't consider it rational to make such claims without any<br>
supporting evidence or logical proofs.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
   The case against "God" has nothing to do with suffering. Any attempt to<br>
formulate a "God" concept presents the thinker with the problem of an<br>
infinite regress. You have no right to the words "rational" or "logical"<br>
if you try to evade this issue.<br>
