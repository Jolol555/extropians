Two messages illustrate the point I was trying to make about kneejerk<br>
reactions.  Nick Bostrom proposed a hypothetical machine which would scan<br>
a person and determine whether they had commited a certain crime, without<br>
revealing any other information about them.  He asked:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What legitimate reason could anybody</i><br>
<i>&gt; have for not wanting the law enforcing agency scan his mind with this</i><br>
<i>&gt; device in order to find out if he had commited a crime?</i><br>
<p>
Michael Lorrey replied:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Simple: The 5th Amendment. It is my right to not be forced to</i><br>
<i>&gt; incriminate myself. Scanning my innards with some whizbang device is</i><br>
<i>&gt; using technology to make me involuntarily incriminate myself. This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; also why you can't be forced to take a lie detector test. If you think</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've done something wrong, its up to you to prove I did it with evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is external to me. I am innocent until you PROVE me guilty. I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; then, if I so choose, use your fancy device to counter your evidentiary</i><br>
<i>&gt; proof by volunteering to have myself scanned.</i><br>
<p>
Harvey Newstrom replied:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Should we force everybody to undergo mandatory</i><br>
<i>&gt; drugtesting, fingerprinting and routine traffic stops to greatly enhance</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ability to detect certain criminals?  The current answer in the United</i><br>
<i>&gt; States is (theoretically) no.  We have to have reason to believe a person</i><br>
<i>&gt; is guilty before they are investigated in such a manner.  We do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; investigate everybody to make sure we catch the criminals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My point is that this is not a theoretical question for the future.  We</i><br>
<i>&gt; have similar technologies now.  Are you proposing that we should submit to</i><br>
<i>&gt; these types of routine procedures today?</i><br>
<p>
It seems to me that both of these messages circumvent the main point,<br>
which is whether this technology should be exploited (the messages made<br>
other points as well, but I want to focus on the central issue posed<br>
by Nick).  The messages appear to view Nick's proposal as a threat to<br>
their freedom.  Michael Lorrey argues that the 5th amendment protects him<br>
from being forced to submit to the device, while Harvey Newstrom also<br>
describes the legal protections in the United States and asks whether<br>
everyone should be forced to submit routinely to similar technologies<br>
available today.  (He may be speaking rhetorically and in fact arguing<br>
that we should not have to do so.)<br>
<p>
Again, look at it not as a threat to your freedom, but as a choice.<br>
As I wrote, imagine two societies, one where people voluntarily agree<br>
to submit to these scans, and another where they don't.  (There could<br>
be other cases, such as societies where people agree that they will be<br>
scanned only if a court finds probable cause that they may have commited<br>
the crime.)  Which one will you prefer to live in?  Will you voluntarily<br>
agree to be scanned in this limited and specific way, knowing that by<br>
doing so you will live in a world in which virtually all criminals are<br>
caught, and hence that the crime rate is very low?  Much of the time and<br>
effort you spend protecting yourself today could be saved, at the cost of<br>
losing this part of your privacy.  Some people will accept the tradeoff,<br>
while others won't.<br>
<p>
The point is, by viewing Nick's proposal as a threat to rights and<br>
protections you have today, you avoid the hard part of the question.<br>
It's a knee jerk response.  Fifth amendment, legal protections, forcing<br>
people to submit is wrong.  Fine, we can all agree about that.  But the<br>
question is still there.  If it were done voluntarily as I described,<br>
so that everyone involved was informed and everyone had agreed to the<br>
conventions that would be followed, there are no legal problems and<br>
no use of force or coercion.  Look at it beyond a shallow libertarian<br>
analysis and you have to grapple with a much harder problem.<br>
<p>
Personally, I am sensitive about my privacy, but I could see myself<br>
agreeing to a rule that would allow scans under some circumstances.<br>
I would not want to be subject to routine scans every time there was a<br>
purse snatched or someone scrawled graffiti on a wall, but if there were<br>
some mechanism to establish a reasonable chance that I had commited a crime,<br>
then I could accept it.  I'd expect that this would virtually never happen<br>
and so it could be tolerable.<br>
