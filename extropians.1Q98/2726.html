Mike, what is HTMLized mail really good for? You still have not given a<br>
single pro example. <br>
<p>
I use Mozilla for browsing (snipping urls from pine's xterm), pine for<br>
mailing (soon emacs' MH). Browsing web pages with the equivalent of lynx?<br>
Brrrr.  Yes, I will archive my emails with searchable Hypermail-archive<br>
type of stuff. Otoh I will write a perl filter to filter out all HTML from<br>
my mail box -- this will also take care of 50% of spam.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; hmm, I wasn't aware of this.  Do you have a url?</i><br>

<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.jsb.com">http://www.jsb.com</a>  The stand alone browser app JSB has licensed to WYSE. JSB packages it as</i><br>

<p>
Is this a free source software? Free downloads alone are quite<br>
insufficient today, you know.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; habitual purging of obsolete techniques, tools, etc. from our regular use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I entirely agree. However, I really don't think that plain-vanilla ascii email is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "obsolete", and I'm not really sure why HTML is so vastly superior.  All I've seen so</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; in no was changes the -content-, merely the presentation.  We're still reading text,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it's just text prettified up slightly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At this point. Much more interesting stuff is possible. For those of you who have browsers</i><br>
<i>&gt; that are 'shocked', check out:</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This guy is really on the edge. He is the new standard we should all shoot for for web</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, but he really should risk a few steps more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; content....IMNSHO</i><br>
<p>
In which RFC is Shockwave defined? How long has it been around?  How many<br>
revisions has seen this standard since its invention? Will anybody be able<br>
to read this stuff a decade from now? <br>
<p>
In scientific online publishing, I must provide a *.ps.gz, possibly a<br>
.dvi, maybe a *.pdf, and certainly a *.html (canonical html, not the<br>
latest whizbangmegablinkbupbup version either by M$ or N$). In certain<br>
cases, plain *.txt (e.g. bibtex dbases) are entirely sufficient.  <br>
<p>
I will be very slow to adopt new standards, for I'd like this type of<br>
content to be accessible for decades. In fact, many scientists are highly<br>
wary of web publishing not only because of lack of established peer review<br>
mechanisms -- they consider the medium itself much too ephemeral. <br>
<p>
Shockwave, indeed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I agree with what you are saying in principle, it's just that I don't think it applies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to email. If even one member of the list cannot read HTML, why should the rest of us</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; exclude this person, when it really serves no valid purpose? Is the ability to mix and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; match fonts going to make the list more useful than the opinions/thoughts/rants/agitprop</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of that individual?  I doubt it, although suffering through the interminable abortion</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thread makes me doubt this conclusion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Flip it. Why should the rest of us who are moving ahead be held back by the stubborn</i><br>
<i>&gt; intransigence of those opposed to progress? This list is for forward thinkers.</i><br>
<p>
Mike, there has been a (little-noticed) exodus of the 'forward thinkers'<br>
to polymath@ already. Salt extropians@ with a little bit text markup, and<br>
only the @AOL crowd will remain. <br>
<p>
Just my 0.00000000002 $.<br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
