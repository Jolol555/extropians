<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;  Linux is an example of a free non-market non-capitalist solution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;What you say about Linux is true except for the claim that it is </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;non-market and non-capitalist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Linux does compete in a market both for users against other operating </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;systems, and for programmers against other programming projects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Only if you stretch the word market well beyond its original meaning</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a place where people buy and sell things (i.e. make it synonymous</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a free system, in which case the word market doesn't serve much</i><br>
<i>&gt; purpose).</i><br>
<p>
I use "market" in the sense of an arrangement where people trade <br>
goods, services, and valuables for other goods, services, and <br>
valuables on the basis that they benefit thereby.  Linux is an <br>
excellent example.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;And the capital is essential to its effort.  It happens to be almost </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;entirely human capital -- something nobody but libertarians and </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Which would still exist in a free non-propertarian system, which most</i><br>
<i>&gt; people wouldn't think of as capitalist.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;What would happen if people went against the conditions of use (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;whatever it is you see that's pasted all over linux when you first come</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;across it)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Not much. The violater would get harrased a bit, and wouldn't derive</i><br>
<i>&gt; much benefit from the violation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;He means that linux has not been made free by a political process but by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the free decision of those involved.  Perhaps "capitalism" and "market"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;aren't quite precisely what's being pointed out here, but certainly a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;classical liberal or libertarian system of property rights is presupposed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  How would Linux be different if there were no property rights for</i><br>
<i>&gt; information?</i><br>
<p>
It would have developed a lot more slowly and would probably be <br>
called GatesWare, on the basis that Bill Gates is better at marketing <br>
than Linus is -- even though Bill Gates would not necessarily have <br>
anything whatsoever to do with the production of it, neither Linus <br>
nor any of the many thousands of other developers who have jointly <br>
created Linux would get any credit at all; Gates would get it all.  <br>
(And this lack of proper credit is precisely why it would develop <br>
more slowly.)<br>
