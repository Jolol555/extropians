<i>&gt; Ah, so you are referring to a central banking system as the point of</i><br>
<i>&gt; central 'control'. This is an accurate assessment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, it is not apparent that this is a 'bad' thing, at least not</i><br>
<i>&gt; currently. As the 1920's demonstrated, failing to impose any form of</i><br>

A brief popular exposition of the contrary view, based largely on Murrray<br>
Rothbard's _America's_Great_Depression_ appears in _Insight_, "Federal<br>
Meddling Made History", Stephen Goode, (16 February 1998), pp. 18-19.  Here<br>
are some excerpts:<br>
<p>
	In the past, depressions had lasted "a year or two", Rothbard notes...<br>
	Government in the 1920s proved inflationary in a number of ways.  The<br>
	Federal Reserve System, which had been created in 1913, was a major<br>
	culprit...[I]t insisted on on an enforce the very low and very<br>
	inflationary rate on acceptances...[Fed governor] Strong and the New<br>
	York Federal Reserve bank were the main generators of inflation and<br>
	and cheap credit, but not the only ones.  The Treasury Department was<br>
	another source....<br>
<p>
I've read elsewhere that Milton Friedman's _Monetary_History_of_the_United_<br>
_States_[?] gives good evidence that the Fed disastrously shrank the money<br>
supply _after_ the Depression started, which helped ensure the downturn's<br>
depth and longevity.<br>

We are ready to accept almost any explanation of the present crisis of our<br>
civilization except one:  that the present state of the world may be the<br>
result of genuine error on our own part and that the pursuit of some of our<br>
most cherished ideals has apparently produced results utterly different from<br>
those which we expected.  --- Friedrich A. Hayek, _The_Road_To_Serfdom_<br>
