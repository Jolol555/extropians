<i>&gt;&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "The breakthrough in memetics is in extending</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Darwinian evolution to culture. There are several</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; exciting conclusions from doing that, one of which</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is the ability to predict that ideas will spread</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; not because they are "good ideas," but because they</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; contain "good memes" such as danger, food and sex</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that push our evolutionary buttons and force us to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; pay attention to them."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cool insight!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It has occured to me that one clarifying principle</i><br>
<i>&gt;so far missing from the peme discussion is that many</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the memes we are calling "pemes" have very positive</i><br>
<i>&gt;uses in human behavior. A good example is the "protect</i><br>
<i>&gt;the children" memes. Clearly it's necessary for our</i><br>
<i>&gt;race to do just this, protect the children,  and we</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a genetic predisposition to do so. It's only</i><br>
<i>&gt;logical that "memes" indicating how to do this should</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolve and be transmitted.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So when we go about protecting kids under our own</i><br>
<i>&gt;motivation and in an appropriate context, the memes</i><br>
<i>&gt;involved don't justify being classified as "pemes"</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- they're not being used for political purposes</i><br>
<i>&gt;(probably.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's when the memes are invoked by political cliques</i><br>
<i>&gt;to manipulate or as an excuse to steal, for THAT</i><br>
<i>&gt;PARTICULAR USE of the "protect the children" memes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc., they can usefully be called "pemes." </i><br>
<p>
Yes!  There's a whole range of survival memes which,<br>
if hijecked by phobocrats for nefarious purposes,<br>
become surface pemes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Further, it is this confusion -- having legitimate</i><br>
<i>&gt;instincts and memes labeled with the same symbol but</i><br>
<i>&gt;used for BOTH "positive" and "negative" purposes --</i><br>
<i>&gt;that makes it so difficult to separate the political</i><br>
<i>&gt;cliques from the power they can get from invoking them.</i><br>
<p>
Good point!  Phobocrats are very good at using survival<br>
memes to "justify" their coercive actions.  To the<br>
superficial "masses" anyone who questions phobocrat<br>
programs can be branded a "child hater," "job<br>
destroyer," etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...I would suggest the same logic applies to</i><br>
<i>&gt;ALL "pemes" whether "deep" or "surface." The</i><br>
<i>&gt;logic's just, probably, more difficult to apply</i><br>
<i>&gt;to presumably more subtle "deep pemes."...</i><br>
<p>
The most powrful deep pemes depend on their survival<br>
for the bicameral need for "external authorities"<br>
-- see &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/wua5.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/wua5.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...The strong "political" memes must, if the above</i><br>
<i>&gt;logic is correct, count for their strength on</i><br>
<i>&gt;hijacking pre-existing human instincts...</i><br>
<p>
We could call the bicameral need for idols a<br>
primitive human instinct.  The Follower worships<br>
idols; the Rebel hates and tries to fight them.<br>
(The Deep Anarchist seeks to expose their falsity.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SOME SPECULATION:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In general, strong political memes work by evoking</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinctive behavior, often by a simple S-R (semantic</i><br>
<i>&gt;shorthand for signal-response or stimulus-response)</i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanism. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would also suggest that it's possible so-called</i><br>
<i>&gt;"deep pemes" may make people confronting them</i><br>
<i>&gt;uncomfortable because such a confrontation might </i><br>
<i>&gt;challenge deeper needs for a feeling of "stability,"</i><br>
<i>&gt;which can be severely challenged by reductionist</i><br>
<i>&gt;insights:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       "Our raw material consisted merely of events;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       but when we find that we can build out of it</i><br>
<i>&gt;       something which, as measured, will seem to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;       never created or destroyed, it is not surprising</i><br>
<i>&gt;       that we should come to believe in "bodies."</i><br>
<i>&gt;       These are really mere mathematical constructions</i><br>
<i>&gt;       out of events, but owing to their permanence</i><br>
<i>&gt;       they are practically important and our senses</i><br>
<i>&gt;       (which were presumably developed by biological</i><br>
<i>&gt;       needs) are adapted for noticing them, rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;       than the crude continuum of events which is</i><br>
<i>&gt;       theoretically more fundamental." -- Bertrand</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Russell, 'ABC of Relativity,' pg. 117.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The implications of such insights seem to sometimes</i><br>
<i>&gt;evoke some sort of "terror of chaos," or something in</i><br>
<i>&gt;some people. Perhaps such fears are more common than</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe at certain levels of development, human consciousness<br>
takes the form of an interdependent network of basic<br>
concepts, such that if any one concept is threatened,<br>
then the threat tends to be perceived as being against<br>
the whole of consciousness.  "If I lose this one precious<br>
deep peme, then my entire consciousness will collapse."<br>
<p>
For many people, this may apply for deep pemes such as<br>
"society," "constitution," "president," "emperor," etc.<br>

The peme program has spoken.<br>
<p>
The fish can't be free, unless all the sharks have been<br>
exterminated.<br>
<p>
Poor victim ARTSCHOLBE can't be free because the big bad<br>
ogre "state" grants privileges to the horrible exploiting<br>
few at his expense.<br>
<p>
Poor ARTSCHOLBE lives in a world in which there are no<br>
privileges, except those granted by the big bad ogre<br>
"state" and by the horrible exploiting few.<br>
<p>
Poor ARTSCHOLBE is at constant risk of greedy, selfish<br>
landowners revoking his permission to be on their land,<br>
condemming him to live "out of a packing case over a<br>
grate.  "What a shame!<br>
<p>
Poor ARTSCHOLBE doesn't know how to grant himself even<br>
greater privileges than those supposedly granted by the<br>
big bad ogre "state."  What a shame!<br>
<p>
Now imagine that you're a deep peme called "state,"<br>
sitting on a throne in ARTSCHOLBE's brain in the form<br>
of the top-dog mind parasite.  What attitudes would you<br>
want to induce in your victim?  Abject helplessness?<br>
And what would you want your victim to say?  What<br>
messages would you want poor ARTSCHOLBE to spread?<br>
