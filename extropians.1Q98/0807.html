This is from near the end of an essay, "Notes on Kafka," by Theodor Adorno:<br>
<p>
"The heroes of the *Trial* and the *Castle* become guilty not through<br>
their own guilt--they have none--but because they try to get justice on<br>
their side. 'The original sin, the ancient injustice committed by man,<br>
consists in his protest--one which he never ceases to make--that he has<br>
suffered injustice, that the original sin was done against him.'"<br>
[I assume the final quote is from Kafka himself.]<br>
<p>
Later Adorno uses the term "the reification of the subject," and I think<br>
he means that the idea of an atomic self, with RIGHTs, who just SHOULD be<br>
treated JUSTLY, is a kind of sucker's game that gets us to buy into...<br>
   Rules that just MUST be obeyed;<br>
   Quibbling over what those rules should be;<br>
   Mutual suspicion, separation and alienation,<br>
   The whole enforcing, patrolling, bureaucratic apparatus;<br>
   A hierarchy of representatives, kings, God, who Stand For What's Right;<br>
   and a hierarchy of body, id, ego, superego, all restless and incomplete<br>
      without Justice (but also control) from outside and further up the<br>
      chain.<br>
<p>
In other words, the sort of society we have plants a permanent<br>
dissatisfaction in our makeup, and in order to scratch the itch, we<br>
continuously act in ways that buttress this society.  Justice is the<br>
carrot we will grow in these pyramids we're building, the promised cure<br>
for the unfairness of life.<br>
<p>
None of which is to promote *in*justice, violation of personal boundaries,<br>
passive giving up of what anyone holds dear; or to completely trash ideas<br>
like dignity, property, protection, insurance or even What's Right; or to<br>
deny the strategic benefits of treating bad guys like bad guys.<br>
<p>
Instead the lesson is that if you take justice as an ideal that can<br>
actually be achieved, or simply must be served, you're falling for a<br>
bad misconception and pursuing an idol that someone sold you, rather<br>
than your own interest.<br>
<p>
Uncentered selfishness (of the everyday guess, grope and make-do kind) can<br>
not be given up (or abdicated) in favor of a higher good like justice.<br>
Both the higher (hint) good and the presumed more noble (hint) self who<br>
sees it, are just self-perpetuating illusions that actually increase the<br>
injustice and pettiness that scare people into buying.<br>
