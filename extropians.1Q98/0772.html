Hi!<br>
<p>
CurtAdams wrote, amongst other ideas from him and others:<br>

<i>&gt; telomere-lengthen the "clean" ones, and then put them back without telomerase.</i><br>
<p>
Here's a thought, our somatic cells have the genes to produce<br>
telomerase. All we have to do is "order" them to express these genes.<br>
Since these genes are expressed during the early stages of development<br>
and germ cells, if we could find out external impulses to control their<br>
expression, we could have immortal cells without the need for some<br>
dangerous and expensive procedures. Inserting genes, filling the body<br>
with telomerase, removing cells and treat them for later implantation,<br>
it all seems very hard and expensive. Also, changing the genes is<br>
something very difficult. Only a few cells treated by gene therapy do<br>
survive, only a few mice -- less than 20%, if I remember correctly --<br>
treated by genetic engineering do born healthy!<br>

Could be that neurons fail because the glial cells also fail. But its<br>
still a big problem to prevent aging in the brain -- probably the<br>
biggest of them all. Not only do we have to make the glial cells<br>
immortal -- which is apparently difficult and dangerous because any<br>
mistake leads to death or brain damage --, but we might also have to<br>
change the neurons -- something even harder and incorporating huge<br>
risks.<br>
<p>
One last thing, telomerase could indeed have more functions than just<br>
correct the telomers. I read a study (if you want to, I'll look for it)<br>
a few months ago that showed that telomerase is highly active in cancer<br>
cells with their telomers "fully-extended" -- not the exact definition,<br>
but you get the point. Also, telomerase is active in leukocytes, but I<br>
haven't found the extension of that action.<br>
<p>
See ya,<br>
