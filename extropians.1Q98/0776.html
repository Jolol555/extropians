<i>&gt;&gt; Not only are your examples way out of context, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; irrelevant.  Bell Helicopter was *the* vendor of helicopters to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; military *long* before the Vietnam (First delivery to the military in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 1946).  Additionally, Bell was  one of the most prominent developers of new</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; aerospace technologies from WWII through the Vietnam War (first American</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; jet powered aircraft, first aircraft to break the sound barrier, *the*</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; leader in helicopter technology, etc) and received numerous military</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; contracts during the time period prior to the Vietnam war.  The founder of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Bell (Larry Bell?) died circa 1956, at which point the essentially</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; leaderless company became more or less for sale until they were finally</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; bought by Textron in 1960.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I never contradicted anything in this paragraph.</i><br>
<p>
Not directly.  Instead you implied that they became successful using evil<br>
"elite power" tricks instead of through innovation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; First National Bank had very little to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; promoting a company who at the time was already considered to be the leader</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in military helicopter technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Microsoft was considered to be the leader in operating systems in 1992. Now</i><br>
<i>&gt;what is it</i><br>
<i>&gt;today? The super-leader? Capital accumulates, money goes where money is and</i><br>
<i>&gt;banks </i><br>
<i>&gt;only invest where they can make money. And First National made a lot of money</i><br>
<i>&gt;with Bell/Textron. The helicopter war was an absolute waste of money and</i><br>
<i>&gt;strategically </i><br>
<i>&gt;useless. Of 6415 deaths related to aircraft, 1792 happened in plane crashes</i><br>
<i>&gt;and 4622</i><br>
<i>&gt;in helicopters. Of these 4622 deaths, 1981 (43 %) occurred without any</i><br>
<i>&gt;influence of the enemy. Prouty: "If you had an helicopter, you didn't need</i><br>
any<br>
<i>&gt;enemies anymore." Still,</i><br>
<i>&gt;they were used in huge numbers. The US Army didn't know a lot, but they knew</i><br>
<i>&gt;how this</i><br>
<i>&gt;disaster could have been avoided. But they didn't want to avoid it -- it was</i><br>
<i>&gt;part of the strategy.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You are mixing industrial economics with information economics, which<br>
operate on very different principles.  Industrial monopolies don't last<br>
when they aren't government enforced.  Information monopolies are much more<br>
difficult to oust because the investments are severely front-loaded, and<br>
ubiquity increases value.  Microsoft is somewhere between and information<br>
and industrial monopoly, and for this reason is much more difficult to<br>
eliminate in the free market, although by no means impossible.  While Bell<br>
was a leader in its time, it is by no means as prominent now, despite a lot<br>
of government support that you claim it received.<br>
<p>
Your helicopter accident figures have no relevant context i.e. you don't<br>
show how many lives were saved by increased mobility and the ability to get<br>
troops out of a tight situation if necessary, all due to the helicopter.<br>
This like saying car airbags kill people (they do), but then forgetting to<br>
mention that ten times that number are saved by airbags.  A net positive.  <br>
<p>
Incidentally, having helicopters are a *huge* advantage on the battlefield,<br>
so the benefits far outweighed the costs associated with them at the time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Similar for the Eurofighter project running now. They officially pay DM 50</i><br>
<i>&gt;billion (!!!) </i><br>
<i>&gt;for it (without the weapon systems), and it's hopelessly overaged. I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;regret this (in fact I prefer inactive weapons) but it's a great present to</i><br>
<i>&gt;those building it. Will probably cost them 10 % of what they earn with it.</i><br>
And<br>
<i>&gt;who pays this present? I do, with loan taxes and value added tax, which will</i><br>
<i>&gt;be raised once again next year (while my potential pension will be decreased</i><br>
<i>&gt;again). </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't know how military contracting is done in Europe, but in the US<br>
defense contractors are tightly regulated and audited.  The profit from a<br>
typical US military contract never exceeds 7%, often less depending on the<br>
contract type.  The small margins are made up for by volume of course, but<br>
the huge margins aren't there.  In fact, most US companies won't take<br>
defense contracts because it is often not profitable do so due to the extra<br>
overhead associated with them.<br>
<p>
Having a pension is nice and all, but if you didn't rely on someone else to<br>
provide it, you wouldn't have to worry about it, would you?  Rather than<br>
waiting for someone else to support me (i.e. Social Security) I have found<br>
it far more prudent to take care of my own future.  It is your fault if it<br>
is an issue.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;You say: The government steals your money. But the government gives the money</i><br>
<i>&gt;to those producing the Eurofighter (and other industries). It's just</i><br>
<i>&gt;redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich -- some weird kind of</i><br>
Robin<br>
<i>&gt;Hood game. How blind must you be not to see this?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree with about half of it.  It is indeed stupid and unjust for the<br>
government to spend money on a net loss project like the Eurofighter, but<br>
both the rich and the poor lose.  Neither of them are getting the money<br>
they put into the system.  Eliminate taxes for these things, and both the<br>
government and the rich are generally better off.  And yes, a few rich<br>
people probably do make money on the Eurofighter, but most of the rich<br>
people are paying for it.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; You shot yourself in the foot here.  Boeing nearly went *bankrupt* after</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; WWII, as production of wartime products effectively stopped.  Boeing bet</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the entire company on the 707 whiched was successful enough to keep the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; company going.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You're right, they nearly went bankrupt after war. *After* war. Quoting from</i><br>
<i>&gt;their</i><br>
<i>&gt;web site:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"At the height of the war, Boeing was assembling 362 B-17s per month. Yet</i><br>
that<br>
<i>&gt;effort paled in comparison to production at North American, which built</i><br>
42,683<br>
<i>&gt;airplanes -- including more than 15,000 T-6 Texan trainers -- for an average</i><br>
<i>&gt;of nearly 600 airplanes per month during World War II."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;While it ran, it brought the banks behind Boeing profit. Certainly. (Although</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't know who was behind Boeing at that time and whether they exited after</i><br>
<i>&gt;the war - would be interesting.) Of course, when war is over and you've got</i><br>
<i>&gt;all your factories running at warp speed, you'll get problems. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The problem is that war is not profitable in the US.  In WWII, prices,<br>
wages, production, profits, etc. were all strictly controlled by the<br>
government to optimize wartime resource allocation.  It is the strict<br>
wartime regulation that destroys the businesses afterwards.  If you don't<br>
make profits when you ramp up production, you will suffer a significant net<br>
loss when production stops.  You can't afford to support vast manufacturing<br>
facilities if they aren't being utilized at a significant profit.  Too many<br>
companies were forced to increase their facilities by the government, but<br>
had no significant revenues to support them when the government stopped<br>
buying war production.  Most of the companies that grew large (like Boeing)<br>
during WWII were funded by the government, either directly or indirectly.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Come to Silicon Valley</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; sometime and ask your average independant consultant.  Even a "pseudo-free</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; market" like the Internet scares the hell out of government because it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; devalues their power structures.  But hey, they're in a postion to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; legislate that nuisance away...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We can make a little bet. Two bets, to be precise. Bet number one: E-commerce</i><br>
<i>&gt;with cybercash will boom in the next two years. Bet number two: Mainly the</i><br>
<i>&gt;(semi-)monopolies of today (who don't miss the train) will profit from it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
E-commerce already is big, and becoming bigger.  I've been in and out of<br>
e-commerce since '94, but it may surprise you to find out that it is as<br>
profitable for individuals as it is for companies.  Last year me and my<br>
"partner in crime" made just over $100,000 in gross e-commerce revenues<br>
(part-time) on a number of amusing little ventures intended to test the<br>
current state of the e-commerce waters.  We also made a pretty decent net<br>
profit.  And it isn't just us.  We know and have met a lot of other people<br>
who are making a very nice spot of cash on the Internet.  More and more<br>
people make a good living at it (we were doing it primarily for<br>
fun/research).  The nice thing about the Internet is that the admission is<br>
*much* lower than traditional commerce structures.<br>
<p>
I have more reservations regarding cybercash at the moment, due mostly to<br>
transaction costs that they never seem to be able to get rid of.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Another example is the United States, where unemployment is at a record</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; lows attributed almost entirely to increased productivity in the economy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yawn. Your record lows have been refuted so often, it's getting boring.</i><br>
First,<br>
<i>&gt;you count the jobs. Second, the standard of living has decreased together</i><br>
with<br>
<i>&gt;the loans. Third, the accumulation of money has also increased. I have posted</i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence for all of this before, but you will find it on my web page</i><br>
<i>&gt;(<a href="http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/documents.html">http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/documents.html</a>) in case you weren't there.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I am not going to waste my time arguing this, because it simply isn't true.<br>
 Several industries are faced with *negative* unemployment.  I don't know<br>
about standard of living (the definition is slippery), but violent crime is<br>
way down, the cities are the cleanest they have been in a long time, and<br>
most people can afford to buy more gizmos than ever.  The only real<br>
complaint I know of is that people are having to work longer hours to make<br>
up for the labor shortage.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The only people who have to work harder are people too inflexible or too</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; stupid to work smarter.  Average people would enjoy the benefits of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; progress a great deal more if they spent more of their energy accustomizing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; themselves to it rather than resisting it.  Ability to adapt *is* an</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; evolutionary advantage.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You have misunderstood me. I advocate many kinds of progress, from cloning to</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotechnology. Much is pointless, like cryo, but I'd like to see it develop</i><br>
<i>&gt;anyway. It just has to be cleverly used. People are simply too uneducated. If</i><br>
<i>&gt;we could educate the power elites, this would probably be good enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt;ensure a better living.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The real problem is that most people will trade a long-term loss for a<br>
perceived short-term gain.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; In a free market economy, it is highly unlikely that all the major</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; industries would be making record profits and unemployment would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; increasing.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have the evidence around me. Our economy is as free as a bee (i.e. as free</i><br>
<i>&gt;as the power elites want it to be). Darwinian selection doesn't work very</i><br>
well<br>
<i>&gt;since people have gained the ability to destroy each other in large numbers.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It is not nearly as free as the US.  I do work for several European firms,<br>
and many of the young, bright individuals in their IT departments complain<br>
bitterly that they have been disallowed the opportunity to profit from the<br>
tech industry.  Most European countries have much stricter regulations<br>
concerning small companies and startups than in the US.  This has been<br>
mostly imposed by legislation funded by the large European tech firms who<br>
would rather not have the competition.  And just to make the point, if<br>
there wasn't a government available to create such legislation, those large<br>
companies in question would be forced to compete rather than opting out<br>
illegitimately.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Too protect populations from people with power who don't have your high</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; moral standards?  Actually, there is a rather large difference between</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; European militaries and the US military in general (which may be tempering</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; your view).  In many European countries (Germany, for example) the military</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is used as an auxiliary police arm of the government, many times quite</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; violently.  This is simply not the case with the professional US</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; militaries, which have virtually no adversarial contact within the domestic</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; population.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The military is rarely, if ever used as an auxiliary police arm in Germany.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Most of the time it just sits around doing nothing. (They want to participate</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the coming war in Bosnia, but it remains to be seen whether they'll be</i><br>
able<br>
<i>&gt;to do it. Our current defense minister won't take part in it, this is sure.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Still they buy weapons and cost us lots of money. I have to pay for this</i><br>
shit.<br>
<p>
The German military *is* used to supress "radical" factions within the<br>
country, sometimes with unjustified deadly force.  They are responsible for<br>
dozens of deaths a year, but it never ends up in the media as far as I can<br>
tell.  The only reason I am aware of this is because US military units have<br>
been involved on occassion.   When I was in the Army (long story), we had a<br>
few people in my platoon who had been in US Special Forces units in<br>
Germany.  The German military units they worked with would, on occassion,<br>
neutralize (to a man!) "radical" and "terrorist" factions in the country.<br>
Apparently this is not all that uncommon.  I have another friend (also<br>
Special Forces) who quit the Army after killing a man and a woman on one of<br>
these missions (incidentally he was shot twice during that raid, but body<br>
armor saved him).  We have bureaucrats like the FBI to fulfill that role in<br>
the US.  The US military is for external affairs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't like that, but the less real government we have, the more I'll</i><br>
have to<br>
<i>&gt;pay.</i><br>
<p>
This makes no sense at all.  One way or another, the government already<br>
takes more than half of my money.  If they took any more, I'd stop working.<br>
 I work too hard to have the government take my money and piss it away on<br>
someone who undoubtedly does not deserve it.<br>
