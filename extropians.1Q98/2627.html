<i>&gt; From:          Michael Lorrey &lt;mike@lorrey.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Humans have been cloning for as long as there have been humans, and <br>
very few cultures have ever had a problem with it.<br>
<p>
We're just trying to do it deliberately, in a more controlled manner, <br>
and under a wider variety of circumstances.<br>
<p>
What's the problem?<br>
<p>
As for whether or not a clone is a person, aside from some of the <br>
aforementioned very few cultures that have a problem with cloning, I <br>
am aware of exactly one case where a clone (done the old-fashioned <br>
way) was not regarded as a complete, separate human being; but that <br>
was in a fictional story (and I am still annoyed at Spider Robinson <br>
for killing off one of her bodies).<br>
