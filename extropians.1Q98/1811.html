<p>
It depends on whether you only look at genetic diversity. As humans have<br>
opened the memetic ecology to rapid evolution, there has been a modern<br>
'Cambrian Explosion' in the memetic diversity in the past few decades that<br>
has inversely matched the decreases in genetic diversity. Additionally, I<br>
think that you are talking only about 'naturally' evolved species emerging.<br>
There have been hundreds of new species developed in genetic engineering<br>
labs around the world in the past ten years. We now have agricultural<br>
species which are resistant to pests and frost due to genetic splicing, we<br>
have thousands of new species of bacteria that have been specifically<br>
'evolved' in the laboratory for the manufacture of drugs and other products.<br>
Likewise, we have many new species of lab animals of all sorts, from pigs to<br>
mice, that are new species.<br>
<p>
I think that the state of the world ecology was like that of an old growth<br>
forest: chock full of diversity, but with no evolutionary niches left to<br>
fill, so no new species have evolved. As evolution is an extremely slow<br>
process, the gaps we create with our environmental stresses probably won't<br>
be filled for at the very least several hundred, if not several thousand<br>
years, unless we develop something to occupy that niche, or use genetic<br>
engineering to reestablish a viable population of the original species,<br>
though possibly altered to be more resistant to environmental stress, or to<br>
bring in an existing psecies from elsewhere that can better survive in that<br>
locale than the original niche inhabitants.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now weather this species loss is a good or bad thing is another question</i><br>
<i>&gt; entirely.  There is plenty of evidence to show massive species lost in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the past, yet life has kept going anyway.  The question here is, will</i><br>
<i>&gt; the present species loss put our own lives in jeapordy?  Probably not,</i><br>
<i>&gt; assuming any of the major nanotechnologies come to fruition in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonable time..</i><br>
