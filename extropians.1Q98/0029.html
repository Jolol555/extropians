<p>
Some functions of government, such as persecuting people for victimless<br>
crimes, should not be done at all.<br>
<p>
Other functions can be privatized, as others have noted.  I see no limits on<br>
this process.  Every legitimate government function was at one time done<br>
privately.<br>
<p>
For those interested in further reading on this matter, I suggest the following:<br>
_The Enterprise of Law: Justice Without the State_ by Bruce L. Benson<br>
_For a New Liberty_ by Murray N. Rothbard<br>
_The Machinery of Freedom_ by David Friedman<br>
_Welfare Economics and Externalities in an Open Ended Universe_ by<br>
        Roy Cordato<br>
<p>
I don't agree with all that is written in these works and they come from a<br>
variety of viewpoints.  Benson applies public choice economics to the<br>
realm of law.  Rothbard is a hardline Lockean rights advocate.  Friedman<br>
is staunchly anti-rights.  Cordato argues from Austrian economics to why<br>
there is no need, in principle, for a government.<br>
<p>
However, despite their disagreements and differences in approach, they<br>
all provide much food for thought.  The historical examples present in<br>
the first three also bolster their theoretical arguments.<br>
