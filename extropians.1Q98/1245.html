Unhappily they are not ....<br>
Other day, I was thinking about the possible logical errors that made<br>
mankind "create" gods...<br>
<p>
Historically it was, mainly, an ignorant explanation of common phenomena,<br>
like death, stars, thunders, even flowers etc.<br>
But with the development of such idea, nowadays, there are deep<br>
psychological programmings involved.<br>
A quick example seems to be certain religious "objects", like gods, saints,<br>
Jesus etc..., They are simply menthally associated<br>
with certain psycho-neuro-physical effects, which leads a programmed<br>
believer to trust that the responsible for the effects is other being, but,<br>
in true is him/her self... (or even two or more... as Jesus said once...).<br>
The problem is that certain scientists become "blind" to detect the real<br>
causes because of their religious "pre"concepts...and... limitations...<br>
BOOH!!!! :-) <br>
