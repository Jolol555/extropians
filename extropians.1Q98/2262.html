<i>&gt; Huh? I assume you are assuming the terrorists would be silly enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use a missile of some kind, possible to track from afar (and leaving a</i><br>
<i>&gt; trail to the launch point). A more likely use would be to drive a van</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a nuke to the destination, leave by commuter train or something</i><br>
<i>&gt; similar, and then blow it up. How does SDI help in this scenario?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you can see your enemy and know he is your enemy, then things are</i><br>
<i>&gt; much more even. But surprise attacks with weapons of mass destruction</i><br>
<i>&gt; are hard to deal with, since you may not know there is a real threat</i><br>
<i>&gt; until it is to late.</i><br>
<p>
True, but setting up a perimeter around a city to sense excessive radition sources<br>
is rather easy and low tech. Up to now there has not been a need, and of course<br>
nobody will do anything about it till someone gets nuked.<br>
<p>
High energy lasers are quite workable. SDI found this out rather early. What is<br>
difficult in a large layered defense is not a defense against the occasional<br>
terrorist attack but in the MAD type attack using thousands of warheads at once.<br>
THis sort of attack requires the use of rather large computing and network<br>
capabilities, that are on the verge of being commercially feasible. Contrary to the<br>
media propaganda, SDI was a smashing success as a research program. The only reason<br>
we don't have such a system in place right now is politicians and money, not<br>
technology. As Ashton Martin of Physicians for Social Responsibility has<br>
acknowledged, "The debate is not longer scientific." (this quote dates back to 1987)<br>
<p>
Thus, for a distributed system, where rather than a few huge battlestations, every<br>
community has a ground based system to protect against air attacks, with a radiation<br>
sensor network to locate ground mobile warheads, this could be a rather robust<br>
system for defense. Oh, and BTW, if you can track a nuke-in-a-truck with a sensor<br>
network, then all it would take to disable the nuke is one of my handy dandy hand<br>
held EMP guns to fry the controlling circuitry in the warhead. Voila, end of story.<br>
