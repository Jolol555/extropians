<i>&gt;Extropian art?  I've just do not get it.  What is the</i><br>

<i>&gt;transhumanism. </i><br>
<p>
Some transhumans are artists.  Their work, as professionals or as hobbyists,<br>
is very dear to them.  Their art provides them with a venue to explore and<br>
expose ideas -- a means to express their views of transhumanity.<br>
<p>
What is the significance of science by transhumans?  What is the<br>
significance of developing technologies by transhumans?  What is the point<br>
of writing transhuman science fiction, or transhuman non-fiction?  What is<br>
the point for designing healthy foods, or working out?  What is the point of<br>
living, for that matter?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am not saying it has no significance.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt;how significant is it in the grand scheme of things?</i><br>
<p>
Extraordinarily insightful -:)  What's the significance of a kiss in the<br>
grand scheme of things?  What's the significance of an idea or a moment of<br>
brilliance in the grand scheme of things?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Granted,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it may have some peripheral value.  But does such a concept</i><br>
<i>&gt;warrant the allocation of resources it has been afforded?</i><br>
<p>
The value of an idea is priceless.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I enjoyed my visit to the art site</i><br>
<i>&gt;but could help but wonder what other ways the time and effort</i><br>
<i>&gt;expended to create and maintain that site could have been more</i><br>
<i>&gt;effectively utilized.</i><br>
<p>
Extropic Art site is not a part of Extropy Institute. That is stated on just<br>
about every page of the site.  Interesting that you should comment on the<br>
cost of labor on this Web site.  Frankly, every hour working on it was worth<br>
every dollar, especially because it came out of my pocket and has brought me<br>
the greatest reward - a sense of accomplishment.<br>
<p>
Regarding your comments on technology and sex; uploads and bio-technological<br>
fashion; the Singularity and creativity:<br>
<p>
The future of sex is integral to our future. Technology and sex are<br>
intertwined and becoming more so.  Fashion (bio-tech bodies) and technology<br>
are intertwined and will become a major domain for engineers/artists. <br>
<p>
By the way, the transhuman.org site is co-sponsored by FM-2030.  He is very<br>
interested in sex and technology.  Style, and art. Also, the fashion of<br>
Bio-technology.  He is also very interested in culture. He also loves<br>
glamour and the idea of avatars.  He should also be credited for being the<br>
strongest advocate of transhumanity. He did author the first book about<br>
transhumans, explicitly, which I consider to be the foremost book about<br>
transhuman values. He is also my colleague who I respect.<br>
<p>
(I'm not offended by your post.  Frankly, I'm a bit amused that someone<br>
could be so inflexible about what is and isn't transhuman, that you, sir,<br>
make me want to rally around all creative thinkers who dare to produce<br>
creative projects that reflect transhumanity.)<br>
<p>
Art and the Singularity?  I think Vernor Vinge would strongly disagree with<br>
your assumed notion that the Singularity is not affiliated with the<br>
creative.  He is an artist, you know.<br>
<p>
Oh, and by the way, Eric Drexler himself is quite stylish and frequently<br>
displays the art of humor.<br>
<p>
What use is humor, in the grand scheme of things?<br>
<p>
