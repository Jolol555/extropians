You've made a big mistake here, I don't want to "recommend sexual<br>
activities prior to proper maturity" I want to not "stop sexual<br>
activity before 'proper maturity.'"  Thus, it is not up to me to prove<br>
anything, but up to you to prove that we *do* need to stop sexual<br>
activities before maturity.  So how do you determine "proper<br>
maturity"?  What damage does not having an 'age of consent' do to a<br>
person or society?<br>
<p>
You haven't once criticised the ideas I expressed, instead you<br>
criticise the lack of books on the subject.  New ideas don't come in<br>
print form, and sometimes it's worth looking at things from a<br>
different perspective.  <br>
