It was remarked recently that many people are hostile to the idea that<br>
humans are basically machines.  From my point of view, the hostility is<br>
not rational; the idea says more about machines than it does about us. <br>
We are still who we've always been, even if we are machines.  But if we<br>
are machines, then that tells us a lot about the Capabilities of<br>
machines.  If we are machines, then machines can experience things<br>
subjectively, can feel emotions, can think, can contemplate, can do<br>
everything we can do, and more.  <br>
<p>
I think the hostility towards the idea that we are machines comes from<br>
the low opinion people hold of machines, in general.  People tend to form<br>
the category "machine" around the machines they have experienced, not<br>
around the abstract idea of "machine" that computer scientists and<br>
engineers use. The machines people use are fairly stupid and far from<br>
sentient.  Calling us "machines" is insulting to those who only think of<br>
machines as they are today.<br>
<p>
I suppose the popular opinion of machines will improve as the machines we<br>
create improve. If we create highly sentient and loveable machines,<br>
people might not mind being called "machines" any more.<br>
