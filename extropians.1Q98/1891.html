If it's any consolation, cryonics is far from a sure thing.  In fact,<br>
I think realistically we have to view it as a long shot.  There are many<br>
things which can go wrong.  Damage may occur in the hours and minutes<br>
before death, as bodily systems are failing.  More damage will be done<br>
after death and before the suspension, as not all suspensions occur<br>
under ideal situations.  Then there is the freezing damage, where we<br>
really don't know how much is being destroyed.  I have read descriptions<br>
by cryonics workers of the appearance of brain tissue after it has been<br>
frozen which are very sobering.  They make it sound like it's really<br>
getting chewed up, even with the best protocols used today.<br>
<p>
Then even once frozen there is the chance of damage, sabotage, failure<br>
of the cryonics storage facility, government regulation, human error,<br>
war, gray goo, collapse of civilization.  This adds up to a formidable<br>
barrier when you are talking about many decades of freeze time.<br>
<p>
If Julian Simon had been frozen, I wouldn't expect to be able to talk<br>
to him at some point in the future.  I'd say there is a chance, a slim<br>
chance, that it might be possible.  Obviously some chance is better than<br>
none.  But sadness at his death should be tempered with the realistic<br>
realization that even if he had been frozen, his chances would not have<br>
been good.<br>
