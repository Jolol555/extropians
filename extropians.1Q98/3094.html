 I read about 150 pages of "How the Mind Works". While it is a good<br>
introduction for people new to the subjects it covers, I lost interest<br>
because I found nothing new in it.<br>
 Here's a something related that I wrote elsewhere in a discussion<br>
of Matt Ridley's book "The Origins of Virtue", a book worth reading:<br>

 Condemning altruism never made much sense, due to the large number of<br>
actions that can be justified by either selfish or altruistic arguments,<br>
and because praising altruism seems to be evolved into human nature.<br>
I see nothing wrong with encouraging altruism. What we need to attack<br>
is the assumption that altruism is a reliable motivator, and it's<br>
probably better to focus on important instances such as property rights<br>
versus the tragedy of the commons than to argue about more abstract ideas.<br>
