Brent Allsop has obviously not delved very deeply into the Mormon<br>
religion, or he would realize that its most basic doctrines are as<br>
Extropian as you can get.  I was raised LDS, but have great difficulty<br>
believing many of the religion's claims without sufficient evidence. <br>
However, being a natural extropian, I was most affected by the extropian<br>
aspects of the religion.<br>
<p>
One of the most basic doctrines of the Mormon religion is that the one we<br>
call "God" was once a being like ourselves who, through billions of years<br>
of widely varied learning experiences and through the guidance and<br>
training of those more advanced, learned the skills and developed the<br>
intelligence and knowledge necessary to create living universes and<br>
create intelligent beings who had the capability to mature into gods<br>
themselves.  "God" is not omnipotent or omnicient or omnipresent in any<br>
absolute sense, but definitely is, relative to us.  God is still learning<br>
and improving himself, and always will.<br>
<p>
In the Mormon religion, humans are God's offspring, created with the<br>
potential to mature into beings with the capacity to create living<br>
universes and countless intelligent offspring.  The whole point of our<br>
existence is to learn, forever; to keep advancing and maturing and<br>
becoming more intelligent and powerful.  This experience on Earth is only<br>
one of countless learning experiences we've had.  And we will continue<br>
having more advanced learning experiences, forever.<br>
<p>
There are other aspects to the Mormon religion, such as temple<br>
ceremonies, the crucifixion and ressurection of Jesus Christ, but these<br>
are all incedental in the grand scheme of things.  The central doctrine<br>
of Mormonism is Eternal Progress.  Unfortunately, most of the members<br>
don't realize that and don't focus on that.  The Church leaders are<br>
always imploring the members to improve themselves in all ways, and they<br>
often have meetings which focus on various aspests of oneself that can be<br>
improved.  They stress education and learning throughout one's life.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, most members of the Mormon Church are sheep and have a<br>
difficult time thinking for themselves, although their scriptures say it<br>
is wrong not to think for oneself.  They are often very judgemental of<br>
others and very hypocritical. They are also very conservative and don't<br>
like change much, even though their religion promotes the incredible<br>
change of developing into a god.<br>
<p>
The central core of Mormonism and Extropianism is the same -- Progress is<br>
the highest priority. Joseph Smith (the founder of Mormonism) wrote, "The<br>
glory of God is intelligence."  Sounds pretty extropian to me.<br>
