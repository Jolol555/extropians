<i>        &gt;A while ago there was a discussion about the role of plastic foam in </i><br>
<i>        &gt;H-bombs; I think I've deleted most of the messages, but over the </i><br>
<i>        &gt;weekend I was able to collect my copy of Richard Rhode's book 'Dark </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Sun: The Making Of The Hydrogen Bomb', and look up what he said on </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the subject. He claims that the plastic on the original H-bomb test </i><br>
<i>        &gt;was placed around the inside of the bomb casing, not on the fusion</i><br>
<i>        &gt;core itself as I've read elsewhere. The X-rays from the initiator </i><br>
<i>        &gt;turn the plastic to plasma, which re-radiates X-rays onto the U-238 </i><br>
<i>        &gt;tamper, creating a rocket effect which implodes the fusion core. </i><br>
<i>        &gt;This also compresses the fission trigger in the middle of the fusion </i><br>
<i>        &gt;core </i><br>
         <br>
Rhodes was somewhat contradictory about this because he also said that the  <br>
plastic foam was used to keep pressure spikes from destroying key components <br>
of the bomb before they can do their job, in fact "Dark Sun" is the book <br>
where I found the quote that I posted on the subject.<br>
<p>
I found another interesting quotation that gives more support to my hunch <br>
that a light fluid like that produced from foam could not evenly compress a  <br>
heavy plasma fluid from Uranium, but that X rays could. It's from Kip Thorne's  <br>
recent book "Black Holes and Time Warps". Thorne never worked on weapons but <br>
he is one of the world's greatest experts on neutron stars and the accretion <br>
disks around Black Holes, and they have many of the same conditions as <br>
H bombs.<br>
<p>
The Soviet physicist Borisovich Yakov Zeldovich (who worked on the Russian  <br>
H Bomb) proposed a model for the accretion diskaround Black Holes that <br>
involved X rays compressing gas. Thorne says this on page 241:<br>
<p>
 "This picture of the flow of gas and X rays disturbed me. I knew full well  <br>
  that on Earth, if one tries to hold a dense fluid such as liquid mercury up  <br>
  be means of a less dense fluid such as water below it, tongues of mercury  <br>
  quickly eat their way down into the water, the mercury goes whooshing down,   <br>
  and the water goes whooshing up. This phenomenon is called Rayleigh- Taylor  <br>
  instability. In Zeldovich's picture, the X rays were like the low density  <br>
  water and the gas was like high density mercury. Wouldn't tongues of gas  <br>
  eat their way into the X rays, and wouldn't the gas then fall freely down  <br>
  those tongues? A detailed calculation with the laws of physics would tell  <br>
  me whether this happened, but such a calculation would be very complex and  <br>
  time consuming: so rather than calculate, I asked Zeldovich one afternoon  <br>
  in 1969, when we were discussing physics in his apartment in Moscow."<br>
<p>
 "Zeldovich looked a bit uncomfortable when I rased the question, but his  <br>
  answer was firm: "No Kip, that doesn't happen. There are no tongues into <br>
  the X rays. The flow of gas is stable. " How do you know Borisovich Yakov?"  <br>
  I asked. Amazingly, I could not get an answer. It seemed clear that <br>
  Zeldovich or somebody had done a detailed calculation or experiment showing  <br>
  that X rays can push hard on a gas without Rayleigh- Taylor tongues   <br>
  destroying the push, but Zeldovich could not point me to any such <br>
  calculation or experiment in the published literature, nor would he <br>
  describe for me the detailed physics that goes on. How uncharacteristic of   <br>
  him!"<br>
<p>
 "A few months later I was hiking in the high Sierras in California with  <br>
  Stirling Colgate. (Colgate is one of the best American experts on the flows   <br>
  of fluids and radiation and was deeply involved in the late stages of the  <br>
  American superbomb effort, and he was one of the Livermore physicists who  <br>
  had simulated a star's implosion on a computer). As we hiked I posed to  <br>
  Colgate the same question I had asked of Zeldovich, and he gave me the same  <br>
  answer: The flow is stable; the gas cannot escape the force of the X rays  <br>
  by developing tongues. "How do you know, Stirling?" I asked "It has been  <br>
  shown" he replied. "Where can I find the calculations or experiments?" I  <br>
  asked. "I don't know... ""<br>
<p>
 "That's very peculiar," I told Stirling. "Zeldovich told me precisely the  <br>
  same thing- the flow is stable. But he, like you, would not point to any  <br>
  proofs" "Oh! That's fascinating. So Zeldovich really knew" said Stirling."<br>
<p>
 "And then I knew as well. I hadn't wanted to know. But the conclusion was  <br>
  unavoidable. The Teller - Ulam idea must be the use of X rays emitted in  <br>
  the first microsecond of the fission (atom bomb) trigger to heat, help  <br>
  compress, and ignite the superbomb's fusion fuel. That this is, indeed, part <br>
  of the Teller-Ulam idea was confirmed in the 1980's in several unclassified  <br>
  American publications, otherwise I wouldn't mention it here."<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Interestingly, he also says that most of the yield in that test came </i><br>
<i>        &gt;from the U-238, as the fusion byproducts converted it into other, </i><br>
<i>        &gt;unstable, elements which then fissioned.</i><br>
            <br>
<p>
When a SLOW neutron, such as one from a fission reaction, hits U238 it does  <br>
not split, instead it absorbs the neutron and turns into U239, this has a  <br>
half life of 24 minutes and it decays into neptunium 239, this has a half life <br>
of 2.3 days and it decays into plutonium 239, and plutonium 239 has a half<br>
life of 14,000 years and works  great in bombs. This is fine for manufacturing <br>
plutonium but far too slow to play a part in a nuclear explosion.<br>
<p>
However, when a FAST neutron, like those produced in a fusion reaction hits <br>
U238 it will split and make lots of energy. So in an H bomb about 70% of the <br>
energy comes from the fission of common U238, but that wouldn't be possible <br>
without the fast neutrons from the fusion reaction.<br>
