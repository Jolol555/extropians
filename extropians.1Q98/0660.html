<p>
That's been the goal from day one and a lot of progress has been made, but <br>
the trouble is that as our programming tools get smarter our ambition gets <br>
larger too and we write more complex programs, so it never gets any easier.<br>
 <br>
In 1946 with the original "Eniac" if you wanted to change the program you had <br>
to change the plugs in a vast patch panel. Turing's "Colossus" built earlier <br>
didn't even have a path panel, you had to get out your soldering gun. <br>
A programmer didn't write code, he wrote about what wire should go where.<br>
Later when computers had  stored programs you could get rid of the patch <br>
panel, but you still had no high level computer language, or even a decent <br>
assembler, so you had to have detailed knowledge of every aspect of the <br>
hardware you were writing for, the sort of knowledge only circuit designers<br>
worry about now, and everything you wrote was in zeros and ones. Needless to <br>
say programs were very simple by today's standards. All these tasks still <br>
need to done, but now a machine does the job and we can just forget about <br>
them. Imagine if today a programmer was  confronted with a patch panel the <br>
size of the Himalayas and told to change the patches so the machine acted <br>
like Windows NT. It could not be done.<br>
