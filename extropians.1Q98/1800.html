Daniel Ust was heard to say:<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; If he and Hillary had said from the start that they have an open</i><br>
<i> &gt; marriage and the Bill likes to fool around, fine.  But this is not</i><br>
<i> &gt; what he's done.  In fact, this goes against his professed</i><br>
<i> &gt; beliefs.  Thus, it does not require adherence to any</i><br>
<i> &gt; _antisexual_ moral code to see this as a character flaw.</i><br>
<p>
To which Mark Fulwiler replied:<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Why are Bill and/or Hillary obligated to tell us the truth about their</i><br>
<i>&gt;private sexual lives? If they want to put on some charade for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; public, what of it? Someone once said that hypocrisy is the tribute vice</i><br>
<i>&gt; pays to virtue. My personal opinion is that the Clintons should just</i><br>
<i>&gt; respond to any questions of a sexual nature with "That's none of your</i><br>
<i>&gt; business."</i><br>
 <br>
Hmmmmm.   That tells me something about your attitude toward a free market<br>
economic system.<br>
<p>
Bill and Hillary were selling a product.  Themselves.  They laid out a set of<br>
specifications during the campaign.  They attested that it was true.  They DID<br>
NOT says..."That's none of your business"....<br>
<p>
Now suppose you decide to buy something trivial...say a pizza.<br>
<p>
The meat looks a little funny....and you ask about it...and are told "That's<br>
none of your business"....are you going to buy the pizza?<br>
<p>
Is the presidency more trivial than a pizza?<br>
<p>
I just happen to have a case or two of meat I picked up off this bull hauler<br>
friend of mine a few months ago.  Since it's "none of your business" what<br>
condition it is in I'm sure you'd just love to take it off my hands<br>
j....cheap..<br>
<p>
Or...if youre a vegitarian...that's ok...I was really lying about it being<br>
meat.  It's really soyburgers....<br>
