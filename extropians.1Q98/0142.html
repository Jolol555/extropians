Chemical life extension thusfar has show much promise though<br>
it suffers from many pitfalls.  The promise is that animal and<br>
human studies seem to prove that certain diet regimens and<br>
supplementation increase lifespan.  Also, as the chemistry of <br>
aging and dying are better understood, means of avoiding them <br>
are becoming better.<br>
<p>
There are several pitfalls, however.  These can be divided into<br>
two major areas.  The first is understanding the mechanisms of<br>
life extending chemicals.  Right now, there are several causal<br>
models of aging.  These models are not necessarily alternative<br>
models.  They do not always contradict one another.  Thus,<br>
aging does seem to occur from the accumulation of damage<br>
from free radicals and glycolisation (actually, two models) AND<br>
ALSO from hormal changes, etc.  Sometimes a link between<br>
a chemical - e.g., Vitamin E -- and a model -- here, free radical<br>
damage -- is made.  In this example, Vitamin E is a powerful<br>
antioxidant which prevents free radical damage among other<br>
things.  Even so, for the most part, there is no general system<br>
or systematic way of studying these processes.  (This is a bit<br>
of an overgeneralization and the human body is an extremely<br>
complex system, but it is for the most part true.)<br>
<p>
One would hope for models of aging processes to be developed <br>
then for means of chemical interruption and reversal of these <br>
same processes to be invented.  This more proactive approach<br>
would most likely spawn the creation of better antiaging<br>
therapies.  Further, interventions could be timed better so that<br>
such therapies would be engaged in when they would be the<br>
most beneficial and do the least harm.<br>
<p>
The second is developing other approaches.  Current delivery<br>
systems are not very advanced.  The body can take of itself<br>
mostly, so injecting or ingesting a chemical often does work at<br>
extending lifespan.  However, when the oil filter in your car<br>
gets old, you don't pour in some oil additives -- you change the<br>
filter.  Following the analogy further, when you can't replace a<br>
car part, often you can have it repaired.  Chemical life extension<br>
is more like filling up with detergent gasoline then do major auto<br>
repairs.  Of course, if nanotechnology arrives, this will be much<br>
easier...<br>
<p>
In the interim, we need strategies that are a bit more sophisticated<br>
than ingesting some neat chemicals, yet are not so advanced as<br>
to be only workable in computer simulations.  Where does this<br>
interemediary between current life extension techniques and<br>
nanotechnology lie?<br>
