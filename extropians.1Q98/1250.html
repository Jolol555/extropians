A few days ago, Ian Goddard posted on the Extropy<br>
mailing list a short message encouraging people to<br>
visit his web site concerning "zero mechanics".<br>
<p>
That was fine; little bandwidth was used, and I<br>
actually did visit his web site. While I had "mixed<br>
feelings" about it, I wasn't sufficiently moved to<br>
e-mail him, much less post a message to the Entropy<br>
list.<br>
<p>
However, more recently Ian continues to post the<br>
contents of his web site to this list. I was<br>
sufficiently annoyed to write a review of his web<br>
site in which I point out the mathematical sloppiness<br>
he and Frank Wiley employ to "prove" that infinity<br>
equals zero, and comment on his preposterous theory<br>
that gravity is due to thermal radiation, among other<br>
things.<br>
<p>
After writing it, I felt better, and in my less<br>
emotional state, it occurred to me that my review<br>
could also be construed as a waste of the Extropy<br>
list's bandwidth. Therefore, rather than posting it<br>
here, I provide the following link to it:<br>
