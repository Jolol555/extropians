<i>&gt;         &gt;Just out of curiosity: why do you object to painful capital         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;punishment? Wouldn't it be more logical (and fair) to match the         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;punisment to the crime?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think it's logical because fairness is a useless concept in this  </i><br>
<i>&gt; context.  </i><br>
<p>
Fairness just as useless/useful in this context as it is in any other. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A man becomes evil because of his genes or his environment or </i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps some random fluctuation in his brain, this in no way excuses his </i><br>
<i>&gt; actions because it doesn't matter why he's a monster, he's still a monster </i><br>
<i>&gt; and must be dealt with to ensure he doesn't commit more evil. </i><br>
<p>
Exactly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; "balancing the books" meme that sees virtue in the suffering of other people </i><br>
<i>&gt; is pointless,  a relic of Christian mythology about hell, " God is good and </i><br>
<i>&gt; if it's OK for him to burn people for eternity then it must be OK to torture </i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody I don't like for a few days before I kill him, God seems to enjoy it </i><br>
<i>&gt; and I do too". Such ideas belong on the ash heap of history.</i><br>
<p>
The "balancing the books meme" a/k/a "an eye for an eye" is independent<br>
from Christian or other mythology. That it happened to be included in the<br>
Christian-Judeo meme complex is irrelevant, it doesn't automatically make<br>
it a bad meme. On the contrary, it is the purest and most consequent form<br>
of justice that is humanly possible. Most people agree (and that's duly the <br>
way most legal systems work) that the bigger the crime, the "heavier" the <br>
punishment should be. You get a ticket for speeding, go to jail for stealing<br>
a car, go somewhat longer to jail for stealing several cars etc. Why then,<br>
would this perfectly logical system stop at capital punishment? People<br>
can get several life centences for murdering several persons, the logical<br>
equivalent with capital punishment would be more and longer suffering.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; That's the logical reason, but I have another reason and it's is purely  </i><br>
<i>&gt; emotional and therefore much more powerful. I simply become unhappy when I </i><br>
<i>&gt; see another living thing in pain, and if I'm the cause of that pain then I'm </i><br>
<i>&gt; even more unhappy. I don't claim there is any profound significance in my </i><br>
<i>&gt; attitude, it's just the way my brain is wired.</i><br>
<p>
Would you agree with a system where you can make a sort of last will in<br>
which you specify that, should you get murdered, whether or not you want<br>
capital punishment/crime-dependent c.p./or imprisonment for your murderer? <br>
In this way, we could all have our own kind of justice in an organized fashion.<br>
         <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;By the way, what would the rationale be against corporal punishment      </i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;for violent but non-lethal crimes?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I see insurmountable practical problems because I don't see how you could get  </i><br>
<i>&gt; the calibration right. Even if they commit the exact same crime, a 25 year </i><br>
<i>&gt; old 300 pound Olympic weight lifter and a 82 year old 89 pound grandmother </i><br>
<i>&gt; can not receive the same corporal punishment. You'd end up killing some </i><br>
<i>&gt; people for minor crimes and giving virtually no punishment to others who </i><br>
<i>&gt; commit major ones.  </i><br>
<p>
Alexander 'Sasha' Chislenko &lt;sasha1@netcom.com&gt; responded:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   10 year jail sentence for these people will also be perceived differently.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And so will forced abstinence from sex, prison environment, solitude,</i><br>
<i>&gt; separation from family, etc.  Calibrating people's psychological </i><br>
<i>&gt; perceptions does sound like an insurmountable problem, but it is never</i><br>
<i>&gt; taken into account.  Calibrating physical effects, such as tiredness and</i><br>
<i>&gt; pain, is extremely easy compared to that.  So by your very argument, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; should abandon all other types of punishment in favor of the corporal.</i><br>
<p>
John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;:<br>
<i>&gt; Tiredness and pain are psychological perceptions, heart failure, shock, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; massive blood loss are physical effects. You'd be giving one person a mild </i><br>
<i>&gt; irritation, a second person a lifelong crippling injury, and a third person a </i><br>
<i>&gt; death sentence, and all for committing the exact same crime.</i><br>
<p>
This doesn't change the fact that people can suffer horribly in prison too, not<br>
only psychologically (I'd rather have a caning than a year in jail btw) but also<br>
physically (rape with aids risk, beatings and even murder are pretty common<br>
in jails). You wouldn't be doing anyone a favour! <br>
<p>
There are thousands of ways to administer corporal punishment, and with the<br>
help of modern technology it should be quite feasible to control the damage <br>
done (and prevent any permanent damage, if so desired). <br>
<p>
Alexander 'Sasha' Chislenko &lt;sasha1@netcom.com&gt;:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   You can be unhappy punishing anybody, but the criminals will also be</i><br>
<i>&gt; unhappy.  That's the point - their unhappiness with the punishment will</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent them from committing [more] crime.</i><br>
<p>
John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Exactly, preventing future crime is the only reason for punishment, or at </i><br>
<i>&gt; least the only reason I would care to defend. My point was that if you're </i><br>
<i>&gt; going to kill a murderer anyway then you can be sure he will never kill again </i><br>
<i>&gt; so there is no purpose in torturing him before you do so. </i><br>
<p>
First of all I think that revenge is a valid reason to punish too. Why not?<br>
Also, it is only fair towards the victims and those who kill just one person <br>
that mass/serial murderers and especially cruel killers pay a higher price. <br>
Otherwise you'd be implicitely stating that you can kill for free once you've<br>
made your first victim (what is there to lose?) and that the lives of the other<br>
victims were somehow "irrelevant". On the other hand, knowing that every<br>
additional evil deed will cause you more suffering might make a potential<br>
multiple killer think twice.<br>
<p>
John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ok, an argument could be made about increasing the deterrent, but this effect </i><br>
<i>&gt; may not exist (it would probably just generate sympathy in the population for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the murderer and make him a martyr) however even if it did and the effect was </i><br>
<i>&gt; proven to be large I still wouldn't go for it because emotional revulsion </i><br>
<i>&gt; against torture would prevent me. Hey, I never said I was a paragon of logic.</i><br>
<p>
No-one is asking you to do the torturing, to watch or even otherwise participate<br>
(assuming the last will system would be adopted). The point is: would you<br>
(try to) stop others from seeking justice in a different way?<br>
<p>
Alexander 'Sasha' Chislenko &lt;sasha1@netcom.com&gt;:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Besides, if the punishment is known in advance, and you think that it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; too harsh on you personally, then you don't have to commit that crime, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you do, it's your own choice - maybe you thought that though the</i><br>
<i>&gt; punishment for you is more severe, but the chances to get caught and convicted</i><br>
<i>&gt; are smaller (we can't calibrate that for people).  So you made a free conscious</i><br>
<i>&gt; choice, and now get the promised payoff.  It will also be a lesson to others</i><br>
<i>&gt; not to do it.  Why do you thing old ladies commit fewer crimes ?  ;-)</i><br>
<p>
Exactly, if you can't take the heat, then stay out of the kitchen. And most violent<br>
offenders are young healthy males anyway...<br>
