<i>&gt;&gt;Hmm... just from this, it doesn't sound like a happy ending for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;extropian.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Curious - this is pretty much the way I recall the storyline and overall</i><br>
<i>&gt;tone from my reading of the novel several years ago.  Apologies to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;author if he's reading this, but it certainly struck me as pretty lurid,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Gothique and downbeat. I was quite taken aback when I heard that Mr James</i><br>
<i>&gt;is an extropian, and that Max More and others on this list regarded the</i><br>
<i>&gt;novel as supporting such views.</i><br>
<p>
I find the view of some extropians that Host the novel had a downbeat view<br>
on life extension and therefore is negative to extropians, to be rather<br>
disturbing, because this was never my intention.<br>
<p>
I wanted to make the point that immortality through science will happen<br>
whether we like it or not,and to make people realise that yet another<br>
development in science for which we are totally unprepared, is only just<br>
around the corner.   Science constantly gallops ahead of our ability to<br>
comprehend the issues it raises.  In Host, the scientist, Dr Joe Messenger<br>
is determined to replicate human consciousness in a computer, with the<br>
ultimate aim of humans being able to download (or upload...) their brains<br>
into it and live on either in a virtual state, and ultimately be uploaded<br>
back into new biological bodies.<br>
<p>
However, without giving too much of the story away (although the film<br>
ending is very different) although he achieves his aim, he is concerned<br>
that the human race is not yet ready to live forever.  I don't think this<br>
is so very different from Darwin holding back his theory of natural<br>
selection for thirty year, or from Einstein's quandry about helping to<br>
develop the bomb.  Surely it is a good thing for writers to creat<br>
characters who do have a moral consciences.  Joe Messenger is a decent guy.<br>
He realises he has achieved something that is too big a step for humans<br>
right now.  Surely this what writers should be doing?  Examing the issues<br>
of our times?<br>
<p>
When the book came out, in both is paper and electronic forms, I did over<br>
three hundred interviews, many on national television and radio in the UK<br>
and opened up a huge debate on the whole topic, one which up until then<br>
many people (often very eminent ones)  have chosen to ignore. I cannot in<br>
my heart belive this did anything but good for the extropian cause.<br>
