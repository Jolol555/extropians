I don't quite know why I was CC'd in on this discussion.  If I had to take a<br>
guess, it would be because I have previously expressed similar, but not<br>
identical, sentiments.<br>
<p>
The "Extropians" have formed a distinct culture containing its own rules,<br>
standards, art, terminology, and mailing list.  To the extent that this<br>
culture professes idealistic and technophilic goals, promotes the public image<br>
of AI, cryonics, and other frequently targeted technologies, provides<br>
psychological support for those researchers who happen to be Extropians, and<br>
encourages fresh blood to join the cause, Extropy can be viewed as a positive<br>
affector to the Singularity and its subgoals.  Extropian art, Extropian<br>
terminology, and discussions about such utterly useless subjects as sex and<br>
fashion should be viewed as supporting Extropy itself, rather than Extropy's goals.<br>
<p>
In other words, the causal structure is as follows:<br>
{ culture      }                 [ P.R.         ]    { uploading   }<br>
{ terminology  } TO "Extropy" TO [ recruiting   ] TO { Singularity }<br>
[ mailing list ]    {culture}    { psy. support }    { nanotech    }<br>
{ art          }                 [ forethought  ]    [ survival    ]<br>
<p>
There are more efficient paths, especially if you're willing to dedicate your<br>
entire life - which is why I am no longer subscribed to the mailing list.<br>
<p>
Have a nice day.  By the way, I now own a "Singularity 2005" T-Shirt<br>
[ T-Shirt ] TO [ conversations at cons ] TO [ psy. support ]<br>
which, to the best of my knowledge, is the first of its kind.  Do I own a<br>
priceless collector's item or an unoriginal followup?  Anybody know?<br>
