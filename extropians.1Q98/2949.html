I would.  And a country is a component of a free world.  And a world<br>
is a component of a free galaxy.  And a galaxy is a component of a<br>
free universe.  Just because some guys shouting off about the size of<br>
his super gun is no reason to think you're no longer free.<br>
<p>
Maybe a FMC system wouldn't have a *central* bank, but it would have<br>
several central systems for deciding currency.  And even if it is<br>
smaller, and there are more of them, and you can choose which one you<br>
want to use - it's still centralist.  And if each and every person<br>
decides the value of his or her own currency - it's still centralist.<br>
