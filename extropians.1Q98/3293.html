<i>&gt; Your bank always fills out paperwork everytime you take out money?</i><br>
<p>
They did until recently.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your account info only gets updated twice a week?</i><br>
<p>
It has long been updated many times per day (as needed) on the <br>
computer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Via paper printouts?</i><br>
<p>
They only bothered to reprint the lists twice a week.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe your bank won't be affected by any computer problems...</i><br>
<p>
They won't, at least not directly.  It's a small local bank (a credit <br>
union, actually) and I've talked to their technology guys.  Being so <br>
small (only three branches, and one of them is only open part time), <br>
it wasn't a big deal to replace their computer system.<br>
