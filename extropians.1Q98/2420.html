PRESS RELEASE<br>
Tel Aviv, Israel, 5 January 1998<br>
The Truster Is Avaliable <br>
<p>
<p>
"The long awaited controversial software is now available<br>
at $149. The Truster is an online Lie Detector that can analyze<br>
 the voice through a phone conversation and show you on the <br>
screen whether the person you are conversing with is lying, <br>
outsmarting you, exaggerating, unsure of his words or telling the <br>
truth.The product is patent pending and is the first in a line of <br>
products based on the same technology. The product was developed <br>
by Makh-Shevet in Israel and can be used in various situations in which <br>
you want to see the 'whole picture'. The Truster will surely mark a new <br>
era. Politicians will have to think twice on what they say in during their <br>
campaigns, voters will be able to check the speeches in their Trusters. <br>
Salesmen will have to be far more cautious when selling their wares <br>
over the phone. How about getting some real answers when you are <br>
shopping for your new home or car? No more 'Yes, I did my homework' <br>
over the phone to mom. Business people will have more of a clear view <br>
when they are told 'the check is in the mail' or 'this is my best price, it is <br>
pointless to go on arguing'. And how about the assertion 'I was in the <br>
pub with my friends last night'? "We are seeking to make a slight change <br>
in the world", said Tamir Segal, CEO of Makh-Shevet. "We realize that the <br>
product is controversial, but it lies in the hands of each user to apply it <br>
correctly.". <br>

This sounds like fun, assuming that the thing actually works. Any ideas?<br>
