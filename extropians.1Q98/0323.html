Hi,<br>
I am new to the list.  Been reading all posts for a weeks or so...<br>
Found this article on AOL today.<br>
.c The Associated Press<br>
<p>
CHICAGO (AP) - An independent scientist said today he plans to begin<br>
work on cloning a human being despite widespread opposition to using<br>
newly developed techniques on people.<br>
<p>
Richard Seed said he is still in the planning stages, but hopes to get<br>
started in a few months.<br>
<p>
Seed's plans were criticized by the White House as being reckless.<br>
<p>
``The scientific community ought to make it clear to Dr. Seed - and I<br>
think the president will make it clear to Dr. Seed - that he has elected<br>
to become irresponsible, unethical and unprofessional should he pursue<br>
the course that he outlined today,'' President Clinton's spokesman Mike<br>
McCurry said.<br>
<p>
Seed acknowledged he is unsure if he can accomplish his goal, and<br>
genetics researchers questioned whether human cloning is yet<br>
technologically possible.<br>
<p>
He said his project would cost about $2 million but take far less to get<br>
started.<br>
<p>
Seed, who says he has a doctorate in physics from Harvard but is not<br>
affiliated with any institution, told reporters outside his suburban<br>
Riverside home that wants to use cloning to help infertile couples, and<br>
that he has four couples willing to participate.<br>
<p>
Seed said he planned to use the same techniques that Scottish scientists<br>
used in 1996 to clone the adult sheep Dolly, the first cloned mammal.<br>
<p>
DNA would be removed from a woman's egg and replaced with DNA from the<br>
person to be cloned. Once the fertilized egg grows to 50 to 100 cells,<br>
the embryo would be transferred to a woman.<br>
<p>
Seed said earlier he hoped that within 1 1/2 years he would produce a<br>
pregnancy capable of lasting at least two months.<br>
<p>
A national panel recommended last year after Dolly's cloning that<br>
Congress ban human cloning, saying it poses unacceptable risks of<br>
mutations and raises troubling ethical questions.<br>
<p>
Several measures to ban cloning await congressional action.<br>
<p>
Seed today called himself a good Methodist who believes humans were<br>
created in God's image and said God intends them to become like him.<br>
This, he said, includes learning to live forever.<br>
<p>
``God made man in his own image. Therefore He intended that man should<br>
become one with God. Man should have an indefinite life and have<br>
indefinite knowledge. And we're going to do it, and this is one step,''<br>
Seed said.<br>
<p>
When a reporter told Seed some people would say he is ``nuts,'' he<br>
replied: ``That word has been used before. I prefer eccentric or<br>
brilliant or near genius.''<br>
<p>
A genetics researcher said today he thinks it is unlikely - but not<br>
impossible - that Seed can accomplish the task within his time frame.<br>
<p>
``We're still in a relative state of ignorance'' about how to make this<br>
work, said Dr. Robert H. Foote, a reproductive physiologist at Cornell<br>
University. ``We don't know it can even be done in humans.''<br>
<p>
Foote pointed out that researchers worked with 277 sheep before<br>
successfully cloning Dolly.<br>
<p>
``Maybe Seed will get enough money'' for the human-cloning experiment,<br>
Foote said, ``but all of my scientific friends are against this type of<br>
thing, not so much because it's technically impossible, but because they<br>
don't see any need to do this kind of thing.''<br>
<p>
Dr. Yury Verlinsky, director of the reproductive genetics institute at<br>
Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Chicago, called Seed's comments ``an<br>
irresponsible'' attempt to make news.<br>
<p>
Verlinsky said that while human cloning is theoretically possible, he<br>
doesn't think it can be done now because of ethical, technological and<br>
financial limits.<br>
<p>
Seed said he would like to locate his clinic in the Chicago area but is<br>
also considering opening it in another country.<br>
