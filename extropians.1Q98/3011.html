<i>&gt; &gt;We have all heard the libertarian and anti-libertarian arguments and</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I disagree.   While I have also heard these arguments many times before, this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the first time I have seen them discussed in depth by extropians.  When I joined</i><br>
<i>&gt; this list I was already convinced of the tech/trans humanist side of</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropianism but from lurking and occasionally contributing I have found that</i><br>
<i>&gt; even some of my political views have changed because of the well thought out</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguments presented here.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I for example, was slightly anti-abortion when I came to the transhuman list 3<br>
years ago. However, the libertarian discussions here and there, especially in the<br>
defining the differences between the concepts of rights by natural law and rights by<br>
force, I came to realize the erroneous basis for my beleif at the time.<br>
While many long time subscribers to this list may tire of discussing subjects that<br>
have been rehashed several, sometimes many, times before on the list, remember that<br>
we are not a static body. Not only do new subscribers come to the list all the time,<br>
but as new information is discovered by science, we can sometimes change or modify<br>
our most cherished ideas and beleifs. Many new subscribers come to the list full of<br>
memes supporting many statist and anti-tech, anti-freedom positions, and we are not<br>
helping them increase extropy in their lives if what they hear is a huge stream of<br>
"been there, done that already, bored to death" from people on a topic that may be<br>
entirely fresh to them, or on a topic for which the typical extropic position is<br>
completely new to them.<br>
<p>
Viewing the list as a personal clique is not very extropic. Viewing the list as a<br>
cooperative school of extropy is extropic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not that I had far to go anyway, I've got a pre-existing strong crypto-anarchist</i><br>
<i>&gt; tendency, but a good example is the issue of gun control.  Many would remember</i><br>
<i>&gt; that this featured for a while on this list.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I do not live in the USA, my country has only a small fraction of the crime and</i><br>
<i>&gt; violence, so I've always though that gun control is the best way of keeping our</i><br>
<i>&gt; country from following the USA down these roads.  As a result I have always</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposed wide scale  ownership of high-powered firearms.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know if I'm a better extropian for it, but Michael Lorrey has convinced</i><br>
<i>&gt; me to buy a gun and stockpile other defensive measures.  I'm still against</i><br>
<i>&gt; widespread ownership of guns, but only for *everyone else*, not for *me*.</i><br>
<p>
Wow. You mean somebody actually listens to what I say?<br>
<p>
Here in the Lorrey household, the family gun population went up by 5 just this<br>
month.<br>
<p>
For anybody in the New England area that is into or would like to try their hand at<br>
Skeet, my club up here in NH is running skeet, open to the public every Sunday,<br>
10-3, until the regular season starts, and more shooting days will then be<br>
available.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Bytes are cheap and easily recycled.  Let them chatter about welfare states a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bit more,  I've got some other long held beliefs that I think are in need of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; update.</i><br>
<p>
Good attitude.<br>
<p>
Essentially, any anarchist of any flavor who beleives that all political power comes<br>
from the individual (and if you don't, I think you may have your definition messed<br>
up), must beleive that there is no system or contract in the world that any one<br>
individual is obligated to without recourse. This includes the 'social contract'<br>
concept. The individual, from whome all power flows, should be able to critically<br>
examine every possible obligation and choose yea or nay on it. No individual should<br>
be compelled by external force to surrender any power involuntarily. This is the<br>
essential problem with democracy.<br>
<p>
Rule of the majority is as much a tyranny to the dissenting individual  as the<br>
harshest dictatorship. This is why so few democracies in history have remained in a<br>
stable balance between dictatorship and communist tyranny for very long, and why<br>
individual rights tend to erode over time in such democracies. The majority of the<br>
moment will always find somebody elses rights that need to be infringed upon for the<br>
'common good', the 'general welfare', or for any greater measure of security.<br>
Eventually, nobody is free any longer, except government is free to do what it<br>
wills, as it then becomes omnipotent.<br>
<p>
The solution is hyperdemocracy and total voluntary association. The internet is an<br>
excellent example of these two practices.<br>
<p>
For those of you who may not know what hyperdemocracy is, it is essentially<br>
different from standard democracy in that while democracy is 'one man, one vote',<br>
hyperdemocracy is 'one man, one veto'. It is a consensual system, where unless all<br>
agree, then nothing can be done as a whole. Only those who agree can form action for<br>
their own interests. Those who don't are not obligated, and cannot become obligated<br>
or violated by the decisions of those that do.<br>
<p>
There have been small hyperdemocratic proposals here in the US. There have been<br>
proposals for the tax system where an individual can declare in their income tax<br>
what programs they want to fund with their taxes, and those they don't want funded<br>
(of course, they have avoided the idea that one should be able to decide how MUCH to<br>
fund). These are good first steps, and should be encouraged.<br>
