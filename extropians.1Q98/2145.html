Great post!  I wanna come too!<br>

<p>
Of course, here in Australia, that's the *standard* use of `mate' - which<br>
might, if we can wake the sun-drenched buggers up, might make Aussies the<br>
perfect launchpad for transhumanism... [`buggers' is another standard use,<br>
with very little connection to the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras even now<br>
winding flamboyantly though the streets of Sydney - but then again...]<br>

<p>
When I was 15 and 16, I lived in a monastery (I was planning to become a<br>
Catholic priest).  I was glad to return to the outside world, but there<br>
really was a genuine win-win, meditative quality in that life which I think<br>
the busy-busy world could learn from.  Pretty quickly I moved into one of<br>
the earliest of the urban campus communes in Australia (in the mid-60s),<br>
and for years after that lived, on and off, in such households.  They fell<br>
apart when couples had kids, went professional, got jealous over sexual and<br>
affection issues.  For years now I've lived alone, despite periodic<br>
entanglements.  It has very many merits - but ah, those head rubs...!<br>
(Damien sobs quietly for a moment.)<br>
<p>
Thanks for the terrific post, Derek.<br>
