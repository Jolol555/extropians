Dear all,<br>
<p>
(sorry, no spelling checker)<br>
<p>
I've got some questions about, if what I wrote was<br>
just plain fun, or if I really wanted to pull something<br>
of like this.<br>
(freedombuilder, I signed up for the mailing list, so<br>
 I am eager to learn more....this mail is more like <br>
a thought experiment)<br>
<p>
Altough I didn't investigate all the "freedom" related<br>
issue's very well, so I might miss some things allready<br>
thought of, I wanted to present a vision closer to my heart.<br>
As far as I can tell, most of them focus on the "make a lot<br>
of money in a free enviorment". Don't get me wrong here, I<br>
am not against making money. But it's not why I would <br>
become involved in a project like this. My idea would start<br>
a bit smaller and more idealistic. I believe strongly in the<br>
"oil-spill" effect....build it step by step:<br>
<p>
Imagine:<br>
<p>
A tropical island of 5000 X 4000 meters (20.000.000 m2)<br>
(maybe you could start with a smaller one)<br>
<p>
Price: 30.000.000 usd (based on the selling price of <br>
 John Wayne's  Taborcillo-island near Panama (360.000 m2) for <br>
500.000 dollar.<br>
<p>
We will only use (at first) one half of the island. The rest is<br>
for public use, and is maybe not suitable for buildings, like<br>
the beaches, etc...<br>
<p>
 so: 30.000.000 / 10.000.000 m2  = 3,-- usd per m2<br>
<p>
 Double this so that we will have 30.000.000 to spend <br>
 on the public places.....so we sell for  6,-- us per m2<br>
<p>
This means, if I want to own 200 m2, I will pay 1200, -- usd<br>
I could build a small tent there in the begining....and visit<br>
it a few times a year to help building the society we want.<br>
People with (small) businesses will buy more m2, of <br>
course....... <br>
But I think you could be suprised by the amount<br>
of people, who just would like to own a small part....<br>
even students (beginners/idealists/etc....) can join...<br>
<p>
With the other 30.000.000,-- we will build, the harbour,<br>
the public liberay, activity-centre, web-conection,<br>
boats, a few cars...and other tools.<br>
<p>
Everybody can join the island IF they accept (sign)<br>
the Transhuman/Extropy rules (to be discussed)<br>
(the laws and penalty's...shouldn't be needed<br>
of course....but ..well....you know...)<br>
<p>
So, I imagine, small software start-up company's<br>
buying a few m2, were they live and develop.<br>
....An importer of goods/food/etc.....<br>
....An eco farmer, who will run a small food-chain<br>
based on new technollogy.......<br>
........a dutch bloke :-) running a camping for students....<br>
tents allready there, for low prices........<br>
....Biotech start-ups, expirimenting with new techniques<br>
...etc..etc.....<br>
<p>
<p>
It's a democtratic -webbased deciding/rule system.<br>
You can vote for everything concerning the public<br>
space of the island (for technical or difficult, things<br>
you have to do an "exam" so you will vote educated)<br>
Something becomes only a problem when one drops<br>
it in the "discussion group" and asks for a vote....<br>
e.g: a biotech firm, wants to expiriment with some<br>
dangerous viruses....then they first have to convince,<br>
the group that what they do will be save......<br>
<p>
When the island becomes to crowded, you could think<br>
of expanding to the sea with the suggested "oil-tankers"<br>
(how far do you own the sea ?)<br>
<p>
Of course among the first businesses I would <br>
expect the Cryo-firms.....you can die in peace,<br>
and you can be freezed as perfect as possible,<br>
this alone could generate some money, together<br>
with the "low-budget" tourism actions.....<br>
Just imagine a tropical island, with net-access,<br>
a lot of very interesting people, knowledge<br>
centre's.......and the fun of vacation.<br>
If I rent my tent to people for 100 usd a month,<br>
I have earned my investment back, within a year.<br>
...and I can start thinking of real house :-)<br>
<p>
At first it's a lot like starting a camping site.....<br>
But once, people come more often, actually <br>
build new things, companys start selling goods,<br>
etc.... it will grow step by step.....<br>
Get more scientiffic conferences. Have leaders<br>
of other country's visiting us, to see what we are doing<br>
(a new vision on the goverment) etc......<br>
<p>
:-)   OK....I will stop now with my idealistic (naive) <br>
day-dreaming....<br>
Still.....I am looking forward to other idea's, because<br>
it could be done :-)<br>
<p>
For the list-member, who think this is pure noise,<br>
I suggest that we use THC (TransHumanCountry), so you<br>
can delete it right away.......<br>
<p>
Have a great day!<br>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
<p>
