Which is why Tom's houserule #2 (Clothing permitted) shows he's a very<br>
tolerant person ;-)<br>

Speaking of women... It is interesting to see that in this thread<br>
particularly _all_ posts have been by humans who are genetically impaired<br>
to get pregnant (I don't mind personally but I suspect mr. Jones does -<br>
ever consider therapy?).<br>
<p>
Possibly the women on this list (and Natascha recently reminded us that<br>
there are plenty of them out there) are trying not to fall from their<br>
chairs laughing. All of us guys arguing over something that is more _their_<br>
business than almost any other thing ;-)<br>
<p>
What the hell are we thinking?  ;-)<br>
