This is the hazard I see as the most dangerous - the slow degradation of<br>
individual worth, the continuing pressure to see people as `products'.  It<br>
used to irritate me greatly when dumbed-down science fiction and horror<br>
movies/TV represented `clones' as mindless swarms of identical ant-critters<br>
that were frightening exactly because of this doppelganger quality, and<br>
deserved to be exterminated en masse without a moral qualm.  Now I'm<br>
starting to wonder if this tendency in the human mind might not indeed be<br>
activated by certain uses of human cloning.  <br>
<p>
It's now amusing and slightly uncanny to see identical twins, triplets and<br>
n-tuples.  But what happens when some polity really does deliberately and<br>
malignly manufacture hundreds or thousands of people who look almost<br>
indistinguishable.  Instant `racism'.  "Can't tell one of those<br>
chinks/coons/foreign devils from another," complacent colonials told each<br>
other... and indeed often they couldn't, because their feature detectors<br>
hadn't been wired to do so (quite the reverse).  There are many reasons why<br>
nobody would wish to create batches of xeroxed humans - they'd be<br>
vulnerable to the same diseases, all that - but by golly what a gift to<br>
anyone who wished to instantly dehumanise their labor force/army/fuckfarm etc.<br>
