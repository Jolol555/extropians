<i>&gt;&gt; way to view a technological singularity is as a mathematical</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; singularity.  In this sense, I view a technological singularity</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; not as a point</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As I seem to recall, Vinge himself spoke against such an</i><br>

<p>
If you'll look more closely you'll see that I am essentially in<br>
agreement with Vinge's comments in that interview.  Instead of<br>
envisioning a technological singularity event as some technological<br>
rocket ride spiralling towards infinity, one should view the<br>
asymptote of a technological progress time line as a paradigm<br>
shift. As you pointed out above, such a shift can be sudden or<br>
gradual.<br>

<i>&gt; There is no way how flesh would be able to persist even halfway</i><br>

<i>&gt; (as there are conservative cryonists, there are conservative upload</i><br>
<i>&gt; researchers) in a world rushing towards the new equilibrium (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; might well be a Red Queen equilibrium).</i><br>
<p>
Red Queen equilibrium?  What is that?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Can there be an isomorphy between an embryo in blastula stage and</i><br>
<i>&gt; an adult individuum?</i><br>
<p>
Genetically?  Sure.  But what happens when you achieve the status<br>
of a "Power" (as described by Vinge in "A Fire Upon The Deep")?<br>
You can enhance yourself in such a manner so that all the measures<br>
we use to gauge isomorphism could be radically altered to the<br>
point of nonrecognition.  If it begun with the human genome, a<br>
superintelligent agent might send the genome through rapid iterative<br>
vicissitudes until no measurable isomorphism remained.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; hinges on factors we have no real control over.  If a holocaust</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of humanity resides in the future then there is little we can do</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to avoid it.  Such a holocaust, if it is to happen, will ride in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; on the apparently inexorable tide of technological progress.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Er, what was that thing, what was it called.. Dynamical Optimism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; like?</i><br>
<p>
Optimism has no relevance in the face of inevitability.  We could be<br>
optimistic about entropy increase.  However, that would not change<br>
the second law of thermodynamics.<br>
