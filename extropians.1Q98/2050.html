<i>       &gt;&gt;Me:Even if these economic problems could be overcome we'd still only </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;exist at the whim of the superpowers, if we were not good little boys </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;they'd send a torpedo up our ass and sink the ship so fast it'd </i><br>
<i>       &gt;&gt;bounce off the bottom. </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;mark@unicorn.com </i><br>
<i>        &gt;This might be an opportunity for the kind of nuclear 'insurance</i><br>
<i>        &gt;policy' that Erwin Strauss wrote about in 'Basement Nukes';</i><br>
<i>        &gt;someone sets up a nuclear-armed insurance organisation and the</i><br>
<i>        &gt;ship-owners pay an annual fee so that if a nation does attack them, </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the insurance company will nuke  the capital of the attacking nation.</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
I see problems with this approach, even if you make the unlikely assumption  <br>
that the identity of the country that shot the torpedo and sunk the rust <br>
bucket could ever be determined. It's clear that if the directors of this <br>
nuclear insurance company are sane then their statement that they'd <br>
incinerating millions perhaps billions of people with H Bombs to avenge their <br>
late clients can be nothing but an empty threat. The success of the deterrent <br>
would hinge entirely on whether the directors were great actors or not, <br>
whether they could convincingly pretend to be insane. <br>
<p>
On the other hand, if they were sincere in their threat then they'd really be <br>
insane and so render contracts made with such a company problematic at best.<br>
                               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Obviously they must be decentralized enough that the nation can't         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;nuke them back         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The head of this insurance company would have to be a very brave man, and <br>
he'd have to buy life insurance from his own company because nobody else <br>
would sell him a police. He certainly wouldn't have to worry about the <br>
infirmities of old age, I'd give him a half life after the nuclear attack of <br>
about 3 hours.<br>
