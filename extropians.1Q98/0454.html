I read just this in a Nicholas Negroponte's recent Wired article about<br>
the upcoming Junior Summit:<br>
<p>
&lt;quote&gt;<br>
One topic on the table will be a proposal by five alumni of the first<br>
Junior Summit to start Nation.1 - a virtual nation for children, with<br>
its own voice, flag, and currency, but without borders or centralized<br>
government. This nation would apply for membership to the UN and make<br>
every effort to include children from developing nations. Here is an<br>
excerpt from Nation.1's first proclamation:<br>
<p>
As a kid growing up with computers, you have ideas, you see<br>
possibilities, but they don't count, you're just a kid. Adults need<br>
kids, they just don't realize it. They can't relate to what kids have<br>
to offer, because they don't understand technology the way kids do.<br>
Kids have valuable perspectives, but the world offers no mechanism to<br>
voice their opinions. They have no representation in world politics<br>
and they have no influence in the decisions that govern their future.<br>
<p>
So with the help of the second Junior Summit, a group of young, very<br>
wired individuals is going to bend, twist, and distort some barriers<br>
with the hope those barriers will come undone. We are going to create<br>
a country in cyberspace, not defined by geography or race, but by<br>
technology and age: Nation.1 - a country populated and run by kids.<br>
<p>
Nation.1 is just beginning, and we are considering how to create<br>
digital political systems, how to deal with language barriers, how the<br>
technology behind the country will work. We passionately believe it's<br>
worth it, because uniting kids changes their perspective, widens their<br>
understanding, and leads to a better world.<br>
<p>
Proposals like Nation.1 may seem outrageous, even unthinkable,<br>
compared with what we adults would have suggested. That's the way it<br>
should be: ultimately, the world must go past what adults believe will<br>
succeed. The global information society is ours only to dream - it<br>
will be up to these children to live it out.<br>
&lt;/quote&gt;<br>
<p>
What I want to know is - why only kids?  I want to have my very own<br>
virtual nation.  NOW! :-(<br>
<p>
So here's an idea - make an extropic virtual nation and get ourselves<br>
represented in the UN, how about TransNation?  or something similar. <br>
Anyone have any idea if this is possible?<br>
