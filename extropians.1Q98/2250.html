Considering that most primitive peoples still on the planet think that the rest of us<br>
passed beyond a singularity a long time ago, I think that our likely hood of going<br>
through the singularity largely unharmed is highly likely. Why? cause we are already<br>
in it. A singularity transcension is not an event, but an era that never ends. The<br>
only thing that changes is the gradient of change gets steeper. Those going through<br>
the events we currently view as 'the singularity' will not notice anything<br>
particularly strange, although those who will be getting left behind like stone age<br>
primitives as a matter of personal choice will notice the dislocation that they are<br>
getting left behind. The most noticable indicator that will also cause the most<br>
disruption is that the phenomenon now known as the 'generation gap' will tighten to<br>
the point where those who do not keep pace with the cutting edge will quickly find<br>
themselves out of touch with those that are. This is being seen now with computers.<br>
The 386 PC with the 2400 baud modem owned by one of my coworkers is unusable in<br>
dealing with 99% of current network technology. The people I am working with program<br>
in COBOL and do their mailstream processing on an old mainframe using SPRI and BIM.<br>
They sneakernet files from our NT network to the mainframe with 9track tape (at 1600<br>
bytes per inch, oh wow). We have these 'baloney slicer' hard drives the size of a<br>
refrigerator that carry a whole 100 megs. We even have an old PRIME. All of these<br>
people have absolutely no conception of the change that is being wrought by the<br>
internet. They look at it as a toy or a fad, yet while they are being outmoded by<br>
technology, they are not being harmed in any way, outside of their future earnings<br>
prospects.<br>
<p>
The one area that I think will be rather violent will be the reaction of outmoded<br>
individuals in positions of power to the threat of being replaced. They will use<br>
force, and rather willingly, against what they will see as abominations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; hinges on factors we have no real control over.  If a holocaust of humanity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; resides in the future then there is little we can do to avoid it.  Such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; holocaust, if it is to happen, will ride in on the apparently inexorable tide</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of technological progress.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Er, what was that thing, what was it called.. Dynamical Optimism, like?</i><br>
<p>
In order to prevent any huge die off from combat between generations in conflict, it<br>
will require the same sort of do gooder busybody attitude that I abhor and den Otter<br>
seems to embrace.<br>
