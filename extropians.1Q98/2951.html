<i>&gt; however, the paradigm you  posit of a "consumer </i><br>
<i>&gt; majority gathered around the supplier minority" </i><br>
<i>&gt; avoids the fact I highlighted, that consumer de-</i><br>

<i>&gt; consumer-demand implies exactly the opposite,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is control of the few (suppliers) by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; many (consumers). So your paradigm collapses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Free-market capitalism is true decentralization. </i><br>
<p>
Consumer/citizen/subject feedback is also 'many to few.'  Central does<br>
not have to mean "control of many by the few" it can be any 'many to<br>
few' relationship (i.e. control of few by the many.)  If you disagree<br>
with this then you own paradigm collapses, as a government cannot<br>
exist unless it responds to the demand of the people (even if that<br>
response means tear gas.)  By your definition a government is "true<br>
decentralisation" so the term "centralised" has no meaning.  You now<br>
have two choices - stop using the term or change you definition of it.<br>
<p>
Free-market capitalism is not true decentralisation.<br>
