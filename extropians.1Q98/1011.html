<i>&gt;It's called "The Architecture of Life" and Donald</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ingber describes his work at the MIT Center for</i><br>
<i>&gt;Bioengineering on applications of the architectural</i><br>
<i>&gt;principles of 'tensegrity' to biology. The point that</i><br>
<i>&gt;I find most relevant to singularities comes at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;article's conclusion where Ingber speculates: "the</i><br>
<i>&gt;fact that our expanding (tensing) universe contains</i><br>
<i>&gt;huge filaments of gravitationally linked galaxies and</i><br>
<i>&gt;isolated black holes that experience immense</i><br>
<i>&gt;compressive forces locally can only lead us to</i><br>
<i>&gt;wonder. Perhaps there is a single underlying theme to</i><br>
<i>&gt;nature after all."  In other words, tensegrity seems</i><br>
<i>&gt;to apply from the cell all the way up to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;structure of the universe.</i><br>
<p>
Phew! how could I have missed that one?<br>
<p>
While "tensegrity" is an interesting concept, and probably<br>
does have something to do with how cells hang together,<br>
that article was lacking in scientific rigor, to put <br>
it mildly. At one point the scientist takes a model<br>
of, I believe, 3 sticks and 6 strings, pushes it on <br>
some plastic, and sees some ripples in the plastic.<br>
This is presented as conclusive evidence that tensegrity<br>
explains how cells work.  Good grief.<br>
<p>
He even overstates the case for tensegrity in cells.<br>
Humans cells, other than blood cells, generally can't<br>
maintain their shape by themselves. They must get<br>
some outside thing to provide most of the support<br>
against compression.<br>
