<i>&gt;&gt; I think some of the motivation for the debate comes from an attitude</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which is not often stated but underlies the hostility towards artistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; endeavors.  It can be expressed baldly as:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   The discovery of penicillin has done more to increase the sum total of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   human happiness than all of the great literature, paintings, and other</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   forms of art, combined.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; And similarly with other scientific discoveries.  The idea is that art</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is fundamentally a form of entertainment, something to occupy the mind.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; But the real changes in the world, the ones which will totally reshape</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; human society over the next century, come from science and technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; All the transhumanist art in the world is not going to turn us into</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; transhumans.  Only technology can do that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'm not saying I share this attitude, but I think it is good to express</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; it in bold and even offensive terms just to get it out in the open and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; let people respond.</i><br>

Yup. That is the notion. But it's based on a dichotomy:<br>
<p>
Art ("over here")------------------Technology Engineering Science("over<br>
there")<br>
                                  ^<br>
                          &lt;societal fulcrum&gt;<br>
<p>
...when another way to look at it is:<br>
<p>
Art    Technology     Engineering                    History      Science<br>
---------------------------------                    --------------------<br>
What we can effect change through                    What we already know<br>
       (or think we can)                               (or think we do)<br>
    All of this is value-based                    All of this is value-free<br>
         (or should be)                               (or is said to be)<br>
<p>
(with a dotted line connecting Engineering, Science *and* Art.)<br>
<p>
Now, if art is just for entertainment (some crap on a wall with a frame<br>
around it), it's hard to appreciate the second model. If one gets handed a<br>
lot of crap by poseurs who only pretend to understand AND lie to one<br>
another about art, it's little wonder that the dichotomy that puts<br>
technology opposite art occurs: technology *works*.<br>
<p>
But technology is ART that works. :) Science isn't art, it's just what's so.<br>
The act of _doing_ science may be creative, but the dry facts distilled are<br>
not.<br>
<p>
( IMHO :) )<br>
