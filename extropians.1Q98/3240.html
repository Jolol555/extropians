<i>&gt;From today's Washington Post book review section.  A bit of news in </i><br>
the last two sentences:<br>
<p>
BODY AND SOUL ON ICE<br>
<p>
Cryonics is still in its infancy when Dr. Benjamin Franklin Smith <br>
decides to invest his future in it.  He has the money;  he wants to <br>
be resurrected in a future capable of overcoming age and disease.  <br>
Naturally, when he 'dies,' his family wants an autopsy and challenges <br>
his will.<br>
So far _The First Immortal_ by James L. Halperin fells like a mainstream <br>
courtroom drama.  Up to the trial, Halperin has focused rather <br>
convincingly on Dr. Smith's troubled relationship with his family.  <br>
However, once Smith has been safely put on cryonic ice, the character <br>
of the book changes to one of brave new optimism.  While the doctor <br>
sleeps on, the world strides boldly into a glittering utopia, and, as <br>
he hoped, technology arrives in time to resurrect him (sufficient <br>
funds rather than personal merit being his savior).<br>
At the end of this novel come seven pages enthusing about cryonics, <br>
with a bibliography, hopeful possibilities and encouragement.  The <br>
author says in the introduction that his book 'might well be the most <br>
thoroughly researched and scritinized novel ever written about our <br>
potential for biological immortality.'  The publisher says that _The <br>
First Immortal_ is 'soon to be a television mini-series.'  Will the <br>
sponsors be cryonic-vault companies?<br>
