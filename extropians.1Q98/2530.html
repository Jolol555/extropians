<i>        &gt;If so-called "rational" extropians cannot discuss the definition of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;human without resorting to vitriol, irrational ethical emotivism and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;kneejerk bigotry, what can we expect from the "irrational" general         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;public </i><br>
           <br>
Well, it would be nice to have an intelligent conversation on this subject <br>
without hysterics and somebody screaming insults in my face,<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;they [Extropians] condone cannibalism </i><br>
<p>
<p>
but it doesn't look like that's going to happen today.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I can't believe that self-proclaimed extropians [...]</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Since Extropians are the ones who invented the word it seems to me that they <br>
are perfectly entitles to call themselves Extropian if they want to.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There is *no* rationality involved in arbitrarily picking a line,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;only different levels of emotional squeamishness.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree with that 100% . I think all on this list would agree that a adult  <br>
human should be treated  with full human rights and that a sperm cell need <br>
not be. The gulf between the two is vast, but that doesn't mean there must be <br>
a sharp line where one suddenly changes into the other, the difference <br>
between night and day is big too but you can't point to a specific second<br>
where things change. Yes, birth is a somewhat arbitrary dividing line, but no <br>
more so than conception. No matter what line you choose things will become <br>
morally ambiguous when you get very close to it, so picking such a spot is an <br>
emotional matter not a logical one. Personally I can get worked up emotionally <br>
over a baby that was just born, but not over one microscopic fertilized cell.  <br>
Your mileage may vary.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;A Gallop poll conducted in the spring of 1990 found that 80 percent         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of Americans [believed something or another   blah blah blah]</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why should I care what 80% of people on a small part of the globe think or <br>
don't think, do or don't do, like or don't like? I do what I want, if 80% of <br>
my neighbors like it too that's fine, if they don't and want to punish me <br>
then I'll just have to try to make sure they don't find out.                <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If we desensitize our population through education and popular         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;culture, we can do anything we want.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Great, then let's do it!<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If we can eliminate enough squeamishness, we can deal with the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;minority who remain squeamish. For example, there'll be no more         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;messy frog dissections in high school biology. Rather, the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;dissections will be done on computer simulations of humans,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;encouraging the entropic view of them as "meat machines."  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
There is nothing entropic about the truth; we are meat machines.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>       &gt;I predict that those who oppose the oncoming world government's [...]         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Please tell me you're not one of those "the black helicopters are out to get <br>
me" people.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;forcing abortion, euthanasia and assisted suicide "rights" on         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;everyone, will in fact, be ghettoized      </i><br>
 <br>
<p>
I confess I have some sympathy with your diastase for late term abortion, I  <br>
don't want laws forbidding it but it's not one of my favorite things. On the <br>
other hand, I don't have the smallest particle of sympathy with your views on <br>
euthanasia. You've made some bold statements now it's my turn. <br>
<p>
Like nearly  all of the really important things in life I have no definition <br>
for the word "evil", however, if the word has any meaning at all then those <br>
who oppose assisted suicide are evil. Making a person live who wants to die <br>
is as horrendous as making a person die who wants to live, both are saying <br>
that my life is not my own and they can decide my fate, it's the moral<br>
equivalent of murder. Such dangerous monsters should not be ghettoized, <br>
they should be guillotined.<br>
<p>
             <br>
<i>        &gt;The key is in the concept of development. Development of the self,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;self-ownership, means others should stay hands off.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then how in the name of all that's holly could you oppose assisted suicide?<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This goes unanswered:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Are you saying that the possession of intelligence is the source of        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;rights?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Ok, I'll answer it then if nobody else has. Yes.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;And who determines whether ability is there or not, at what         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;threshold of ability?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The same person who told you that abortion must be outlawed. The same person <br>
who told you that a baby born without a brain and doomed to die before his <br>
second birthday, or a adult in a deep coma for 20 years has more rights than  <br>
a happy healthy chimpanzee.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This goes unanswered:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;What's wrong with commercializing all life, at all stages of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;development, including humans, intelligent or otherwise, conscious        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;or otherwise?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nothing.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Just make all life into products in the marketplace, all custom        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;designed for any use whatsoever?             </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
If we did that there would be less misery in the world. Child abuse would  <br>
drop dramatically, those who love their children would still do so and those <br>
who don't would nevertheless have reason to treat them well because you don't<br>
deliberately damage an asset that has value. The treatment of the sick would <br>
improve because there would be more organs for translation and hope would <br>
increase because of better research.<br>
