Talk of "ideal" Extropian communities sounds weird to me. How is that<br>
different from "the ideal Extropian job?" Surely what works best will vary<br>
from individual to individual and group to group. For that reason I would<br>
say there is *no* ideal Extropian community, nor will there ever be.<br>
Another reason is that "ideal" is a suspiciously Platonic notion. It's like<br>
companies advertising their products as the "ultimate" X. They don't really<br>
mean "ultimate", but merely "the best you can find today".<br>
<p>
So, rather than talking about ideal Extropian communities, I suggest we<br>
talk simply about Extropian communities, or even "optimal Extropian<br>
communities", since I take "optimal" to mean what is contextually the best,<br>
rather than best in all situations for all people.<br>
<p>
NEXUS: <br>
Traditionally (if I can use that term in an extropian context!) living<br>
spaces inhabited by Extropians have been referred to by the term "nexus". I<br>
first applied that term to the house on Burlington Avenue in Los Angeles<br>
where I lived with several Extropians -- Dave Krieger, and Adam Mackler.<br>
When I moved to Riverside and lived with Derek Strong, Ralph Whalen, Tanya<br>
Jones we had another nexus.<br>
<p>
MODEL GROUP NEXUS: If you want to know about how this kind of Extropian<br>
community works, you should know that the largest nexus that I know of is<br>
what used to be called the Pheonexus (since it was in Pheonix, AZ), but<br>
which moved to northern California and grew to five people (plus a sixth,<br>
Dave Krieger regularly visits). I suppose today it might be called the<br>
TransNexus, since it made a transition from AZ to CA. Or maybe: The ExNex.<br>
(Derek, what do you think of these? Or have you already come up with a new<br>
name for the moved Pheonexus?)<br>
<p>
Another Nexus, one where much frivolity, dancing, fun, sex, and other<br>
pleasures (including "the tent" -- say no more) is the Freeland Nexus where<br>
Extropy Institute has held a couple of fantastic parties.<br>
<p>
To return to the faulty idea of an "ideal" community, I should point out<br>
that a bunch of individuals living together, while great for some, will not<br>
work for others. For some couples, and for families, other models will<br>
often work better. There are several Extropian family Nexi/Nexuses, such as<br>
that of the Heward Family (which, when everyone is there, includes four ExI<br>
members, with the two youngers potential Extropians....)<br>
<p>
Finally, to me the term "Extropia" refers not to an ideal society, but to<br>
an evolving, open-ended process or framework for experimentation.<br>
Extropians are not utopians in the sense of trying to bring about some<br>
static, unchanging, "perfect" or "ideal" society or community.<br>
