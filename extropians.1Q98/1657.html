Since I have gotten so  *many* responses for more info on EM, I will <br>
post what I have written so far- <br>
<p>
Keep in mind that what I'm posting here is enough to get everyone <br>
started.  As you progress with this technique you will eventually want <br>
to adapt it to fit your own needs.  Therefore I can give additional <br>
advice to those on an individual level as to how you might progress if <br>
this method works for you.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!<br>
<p>
<p>
Energized meditation (EM) makes at least one assumption - that our <br>
psychological states (Circuits 1 and 2) are synonymous with actual <br>
physical tensions in the body.  That these tensions are in fact the <br>
neurosis and anxieties that we are all plagued with to some degree.  So <br>
the key to these techniques is to eliminate these tensions.<br>
<p>
Over the years, I found dozens of ways to practice this technique, but <br>
it all comes down to 2 basic things:<br>
<p>
1) Maximizing the stimulation of  bodily tensions through a liberal <br>
application of exercising and stretching.  This can be as simple as <br>
waving and wagging your arms about in as many ways as you can for 5 <br>
minutes.<br>
<p>
2) Circular breathing - any speed you want.  Although in most cases you <br>
want to reserve rapid breathing for those times that a deep tension <br>
seems ready to release itself.  To do circular breathing, just make sure <br>
that there are no pauses between your inhalations and exhalations.  Keep <br>
in mind there will be times during the warm up that we will do more <br>
counted and controlled breathing.<br>
<p>
These techniques can be very powerful.  So I think we should play it <br>
safe by starting with a less intense regiment. If you think your ready <br>
to attack the deeper and more blocked tensions please let me know.  I do <br>
however recommend that if you haven't done any type of body or breath <br>
work to stick with this first regiment for at least 3 months.<br>
<p>
Although I can now utilize these techniques regardless of my condition, <br>
I recommend that you start out by making sure your bladder and bowel are <br>
empty and at least 2 hours have passed since your last meal.  Also make <br>
sure that you will have 30-45 minutes of little or no interruptions.<br>
<p>
Note: The purpose of these exercises is to remove chronic muscle <br>
tensions.  You will experience "explosions" of energy and some clonisms <br>
(tremors or shudders) if you do the exercises properly.  Be prepared for <br>
this and do not be afraid when it happens.<br>
<p>
Step 1. Sit, lie down or stand up.  Make faces - stretch all the muscles <br>
in the face.  Open your mouth as wide as you can, move the jaw from side <br>
to side.  At the same time open your eyes as wide as you can.  Move your <br>
eyes up and down and from side to side.  This will begin to release <br>
tension, thereby removing obsessive thoughts that lie hidden in these <br>
areas. Make as many different faces as you can.  Use a mirror if you <br>
wish.  Do this for 5 minutes.<br>
<p>
Step 2. Hum and chatter - Hum from the depths of your belly.  Use Om or <br>
just Um.  Do this for 1-2 minutes.   Now stick your tongue out and <br>
chatter DADA, MAMA, BABA.  While doing this stick out your jaw as far as <br>
you can and continue humming and chattering.  Do this for 3 minutes.<br>
<p>
Step 3.  Pull your shoulders up as if you where trying to reach your <br>
ears.  Hold for several seconds feeling the strain then drop them as low <br>
as you can.  Repeat this for 2 minutes.<br>
<p>
Step 4.  With your mouth open take in a deep breath inflating your chest <br>
and pulling your stomach in and up.  Hold for a count of 5 and then just <br>
let the chest fall and the belly relax.  Repeat this 10 times allowing a <br>
count of 7 to elapse before your next inhalation.<br>
<p>
Step 5.  Turn your head from side to side as slowly and as far as you <br>
can.  Try deep breathing in rhythm to your motion.  Repeat for 1 minute.<br>
<p>
Step 6.  Lying down on your back, hold your legs about 4 inches off the <br>
ground and stretch arms and legs outward.  Hold this as long as you can <br>
then let them drop.  Repeat 2 times.  (If this bothers your back, try <br>
some kind of support - the key here is for your abdominal and leg <br>
muscles to be stimulated).<br>
<p>
Step 7.  **This step is by far the most important part**  With your <br>
mouth slightly open breathe rapidly, sighing as you exhale. Do this for <br>
2-3 minutes.  When you finish and or you start to feel lightheaded or <br>
dizzy slow your breathing down and lie on your back.  For the next 15 <br>
minutes relax and enjoy the experience.  Don't do anything other than <br>
experience and feel your body as deeply as you can.  If you feel your <br>
about to shudder don't stop it, just let it happen and breathe it out.<br>
 <br>
Step 8.  I'm a big believer in positive re-enforcement, so at this point <br>
go treat yourself to your favorite desert or goodie.  You deserve it!  <br>
