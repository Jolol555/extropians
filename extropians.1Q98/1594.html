<p>
[A couple of comments, upon being roused from my literary torpor by mention of<br>
my name . . .]<br>
<p>
I haven't read TFI (but soon will), but think Damien is probably on target, at<br>
least as far as expressing one part of a fairly wide-spread negative view of<br>
the role and result of jury trials.  The more generalized expression of that<br>
view is that "lay" juries (1) don't do a very good job of judging factual<br>
disputes involving complex or technical matters and/or (2) are too easily<br>
swayed by emotion.<br>
<p>
On the first point, opponents of the lay jury point to the increasingly<br>
complex and technical nature of matters brought before the courts, and bemoan<br>
the necessity of using expert witnesses to express such issues in "common<br>
sense" terms that sometimes lose essential matters.  Thus the development of<br>
the professional expert witness who may have a minimum of technical expertise,<br>
but who has "jury appeal".  And thus the recent spate of (I think laudable)<br>
judicial opinions creating a filter for scientific methodology on such expert<br>
testimony (although that just moves the preliminary assessment of methodology<br>
from the jury room to the bench).<br>
<p>
As I and others have written on this factor before, the use of private<br>
arbitration panels in which the arbitrators are people selected for (among<br>
other reasons) their experience and expertise in the field at issue is a<br>
developing trend arising from dissatisfaction with the lay jury as judge of<br>
technical fact questions.  The problem is that such arbitration is only<br>
available as a matter of contract: Juries are still the primary -- and,  in<br>
most cases, the only -- judges of facts made available by our current legal<br>
system in tort cases.  The one exception is the use of "special masters"<br>
appointed by the court (although a party may in some instances move for<br>
appointment of such a master).  Unfortunately, special masters are rarely used<br>
in jury trials.<br>
<p>
The second point is much less susceptible to rational argument and analysis.<br>
Opponents of the lay jury argue that lay jurors, with little or (usually) no<br>
experience in resolving important disputes between people with whom they have<br>
no personal connection, tend to base their decisions far too greatly on their<br>
"gut" reactions to the emotional aspects of the case.  The paradigm example is<br>
the apparently natural human tendency to be less than properly skeptical in<br>
deciding the question of liability when faced with evidence of painful<br>
personal injury.  The natural human tenancy to empathize with someone who has<br>
been badly injured causes most people to want to do SOMETHING for the injured<br>
party.  In the context of a trial, the only available remedy is the award of<br>
money damages.  All too often a clearly injured plaintiff is awarded damages<br>
out of sympathy, despite the fact that the defendant has made a compelling<br>
case that she was not the CAUSE of those damages.  Professional judges become<br>
quite literally (and, in my opinion, properly) "hard-hearted" in this<br>
connection: Having seen many similar disputes and having been schooled in the<br>
skepticism inherent in evidentiary law and the procedural due process inherent<br>
in the adversary legal system, they more easily reserve judgment and separate<br>
natural human empathy from the task of deciding causation.<br>
<p>
There are those who point out, perhaps ironically, that private arbitrators<br>
suffer from the same failings as the lay juror on this second point.  Most<br>
arbitrators perform that function only a few times in their lives.  Thus,<br>
while they may be more technically competent judges of complex factual<br>
questions, they tend to be less adept at isolating their own personal<br>
emotional response to the issue presented to them. This factor tends to be<br>
offset by the subject matter usually presented to professional arbitrators,<br>
which by and large tends to be in less emotional disputes to begin with (a<br>
construction contract or maritime charter dispute, for instance).<br>
<p>
Proponents of the lay jury advocate their use for two main reasons: (1) lay<br>
jurors represent a means of tapping a community's standards of common sense in<br>
deciding basic human disputes and (2) they serve as a check on the sometimes<br>
arbitrary exercise of power by a professional judge.  The first of these<br>
points is difficult to attack, as it is usually expressed in terms so closely<br>
allied with the democratic ideal of our age that to do so risks being labeled<br>
the tool of tyrants or plutocrats.  The second (closely related) point has<br>
more rational appeal, as it represents a systemic argument based on the ideal<br>
of a legal system characterized by procedural and substantive checks and<br>
balances.  On more than one occasion I have heard an otherwise conservative<br>
lawyer ruefully admit that she was glad of having a jury to protect her client<br>
from a cantankerous judge.  In any event, proponents of the lay jury<br>
ultimately appeal to essentially political concepts to support continuation of<br>
that institution.<br>
<p>
The extropian ideal of a polycentric legal system appeals to me because it<br>
holds out the promise of experimentation with all of the elements discussed<br>
above.  It isn't difficult to imagine many different procedural variants in<br>
which professional judges, technical arbitrators and lay jurors are mixed,<br>
matched and set in dynamic tension to achieve an optimal system of dispute<br>
resolution for disputes of different kinds.  The U.S. federalist experiment<br>
has been a beginning in this direction, as has the development of arbitration<br>
law as a regime of private law-by-contract.  The common law's and modern<br>
procedural codes' division of labor between judge and jury in matters of law,<br>
procedure and fact is another.  Abolition of lay juries in one of the states<br>
would be an excellent experiment and forum choice clauses would allow parties<br>
-- in contract disputes at least -- to engage in a determination of the merit<br>
of such an experiment.<br>
