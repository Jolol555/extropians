I thought some parts were quite funny, actually.  The scene where they cut<br>
off the girl's head was bizarre.  "Looks like it's about to come loose,<br>
grab hold of it, will you?"  Holding the wrapped head with his bare hands,<br>
hair dangling out of the wrapping, the cryonics tech tries to put it into<br>
the container.  It doesn't fit very well, and he kind of has to really<br>
jam it in.  It reminded me of something out of Plan 9 from Outer Space.<br>
I almost fell on the floor laughing.  Someday this will make ideal fodder<br>
for a Mystery Science Theater.<br>
<p>
The problem I had with the whole cryonics aspect is that the girl was such<br>
an unsympathetic character.  From the very beginning she was presented as<br>
a home-wrecker, a conniving, manipulative person.  Creepy music played<br>
when she was on the screen.  Her attraction to the researcher was never<br>
presented as an honest human emotion, she was just a symbol of temptation.<br>
So it was impossible to feel sympathy for the prospect of her losing<br>
her cryonic preservation.  We can't root for her, so when we see people<br>
working so hard to save her, it just seems stupid and pointless.<br>
<p>
Both instances of cryonic suspension mentioned end up tragically.  The<br>
researcher's father had been thawed when his cryonic company went bankrupt,<br>
and of course the girl got her head shattered.  This may further promote<br>
the image of cryonics as something that will not work.<br>
<p>
Philosophically, the movie did not strike a unified tone, but lurched from<br>
position to position.  We had speeches about the benefits of immortality<br>
and post-biological man, but then there was the one about how uploading<br>
can not work because you leave the spirit behind with the body.  Finally<br>
we have the apparently positive ending, which is inconsistent with what<br>
we have just been shown.  If the girl lost her humanity by uploading, why<br>
won't it happen to the guy?  Do we need the body, the soul, the spirit,<br>
or don't we?  The movie doesn't address these questions, so the ending<br>
just looks tacked-on to give something happy.  It doesn't make any sense<br>
in the context of what had been presented before.<br>
<p>
It would have worked better if, after the speculation about the need<br>
for a body/soul/spirit which is lost by uploading, the other character<br>
had challenged that explanation, saying that the girl had never seemed<br>
too stable to begin with, and that the changes relating to uploading<br>
had simply been too stressful for her to handle.  He could argue that<br>
the basic idea was sound, but that you need the right person as a subject,<br>
someone with a positive mental outlook (namely, himself).  This would have<br>
at least made the ending coherent.<br>
