<p>

<i>&gt;fact based, investigative study.</i><br>
<p>
You have a good point but it isn't functional and most of art is functional.<br>
For example, the architect has an idea, a vision, if you will.  She takes<br>
her vision to the computer and begins designing the structure.  Her<br>
mathematical computations must be accurate, and the suggested materials to<br>
build the structure must be chosen carefully, the geological location for<br>
the structure must be of a soil-texture that can afford the size and weight<br>
of the structure.  If all the requirements meat the goals, then the<br>
architects vision is realized and her space habitat on Titan is built.<br>
<p>
Similarly, if an author writes a novel and the plot is comprised of<br>
characters, tension or drama (plot point), the author must develop each<br>
character carefully, workout the direction of the story and make sure that<br>
all the pieces fit together in such a manner that allows his vision, his<br>
story, to become a novel that makes sense.  The components of the novel's<br>
plot can not happen only because of his whim or personal expression, but<br>
because he attentively and painstakingly plots out the story.<br>
<p>
Both art and science stem from ideas.  Both art and science require<br>
discipline and tenacity.  Both search out a truth.  However, interrelated<br>
the can be, they are clearly different disciplines. Whereas scientific<br>
method is the principles and empirical processes of discovery and<br>
demonstration considered characteristic of or necessary for scientific<br>
investigation, artistic method is anything you darn well please!:)<br>

More Art!<br>
