Not only a speedup, but a critical enabler. If<br>

solvated biopolymer bootstrap route. <br>

This is comparing apples and oranges. Producing a crude molecular<br>
assembler is a bootstrap tinkering thing, while (i)PFP is just (lots) of<br>
crunch. Engineering bacteria and jarvesting proteins in (k)g quantities<br>
from fermenters is not particularly hard. <br>

Apparently, they are investigating silicon clusters for building blocks.<br>

Doesn't _seem_. I do not see how I can engineer enzymes, and design<br>
good-fit complementary surfaces without a full-blown IPFP. Btw, granted<br>
how fantastically inert inner buckytube faces are, putting an infinite<br>
C=C=C=C-rope generating designer enzyme into a watery microenvironment on<br>
the other side of the (fluorine-terminated) buckytube, mounted onto an SPM<br>
cantilever in vacuo would seem to make a good hybride bootstrap for<br>
mechanosynthetic nanolitho.<br>

<p>
Very true. Consider the HUGO/pharma fields.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;there is a great deal of continuity in technological progress.  If you want</i><br>

(Un)fortunately, there are not too many of the latter out there.<br>
