----------<br>
<i>&gt; From: Reilly Jones &lt;Reilly@compuserve.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why should the public listen to individuals who represent themselves as</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropians, supposedly holding to principles of protecting and enhancing</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent life, when they condone cannibalism, when they condone the</i><br>
<i>&gt; murder and arbitrary use of developing selves until those selves are</i><br>
<i>&gt; capable of standing up and shouting "I claim rights for myself"?  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; children, born or unborn, have no rights until they can claim them,</i><br>
adults<br>
<i>&gt; can use them as resources for *anything* a twisted mind can conceive. </i><br>
The<br>
<i>&gt; general public is not brain dead yet, extropian credibility just took a</i><br>
<i>&gt; turn for the worse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I am taking this way to personal of course: but who are you to judge this<br>
black &amp; white on Extropians. May I remind you that we are individuals who<br>
care for one an other based on some similar principles........and that this<br>
discussion is so complex that you should be bit less drastically in jumping<br>
to conclusions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Will the world death-worshipping elites</i><br>
<p>
What on earth are you talking about !!?? IMHO, you need to read<br>
a lot more about a lot of things on several related sites of<br>
Transhumanism........<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; When I drive by the local abortion "clinic" every day, I am acutely aware</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I am driving by a Nazi or Stalinist death camp. </i><br>
<p>
I just can't believe this !! ....and this is from someone, who claims "we"<br>
address only issues based on emotional bias........<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Non sequitor.  What do the globally balanced, politically correct Nobel</i><br>
<i>&gt; prizes have to do with the definition of human?  Is the ever-so</i><br>
politically<br>
<i>&gt; circumspect Nobel prize committee who we go to in order to be granted</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights?  Do you grasp that you and your fellow travelers are arrogantly</i><br>
<i>&gt; forcing your definition on everyone else, with the exception of the one</i><br>
<i>&gt; ghetto you'll allow us, the Vatican?</i><br>
<p>
Well...I must admit, that's one way of putting it.<br>
Call me fainthearted.....but could you please try to be a little less<br>
arrogant in spreading your meme's<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is very intersting to see which of my points and questions go</i><br>
<i>&gt; unanswered.  The silence is deafening.  I don't count ethical emotivism</i><br>
as<br>
<i>&gt; containing any answers, only personal expressions of feelings, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals who use feelings as a moral guide are little better than</i><br>
slaves<br>
<i>&gt; responding to their masters' instruction of what *to* feel.</i><br>
<p>
......and what do you call your way of presenting the "facts" ?<br>
<p>
I think you have a very good point: we have to draw the line....and who is <br>
the judge of that. But claiming that it *has* to be right from the first<br>
"few:<br>
cells is as dogmatic as any other claim.............<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This goes unanswered:</i><br>
<i>&gt; RJ: &lt;Are you saying that the possession of intelligence is the source of</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights?&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; AK: &lt;The ability to have Intelligence &amp; consiousness.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; RJ:  &lt;And who determines whether ability is there or not, at what</i><br>
threshold<br>
<i>&gt; of ability?  Which individuals grant us our rights?  Can I talk to them?&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The ones who already posses Intelligence &amp; consciousness. <br>
And IMHO the one who actually carries this "life-potential" should<br>
be very high in this "deciding-hierarchy" if not on top. Bringing an<br>
"intelligent Information Entity" into the world makes you responsible<br>
for it's (well) being. So you have to judge up front (how hard that may be)<br>
if you can handle this. If you "can" oversee the scope of that impact<br>
on you and "the world" you may be the judge.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This goes unanswered:</i><br>
<i>&gt; AK: &lt;All consious beings should be treated with respect whether they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; humans, dolphins or computers.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; RJ: &lt;Why should I?  Who says so?&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Nobody say so.....<br>
But it's very simple: don't do to anyone/anything what you don't want to <br>
be done to you. I think it's almost a natural law. If you do good, you'll <br>
receive it (logical...not emotional)....If you do bad.....well expect that<br>
you <br>
hurt "people"......so keep looking over the back of your shoulder........<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This goes unanswered:</i><br>
<i>&gt; RJ: &lt;The key is in the concept of development.  Development of the self,</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-ownership, means others should stay hands off.  But development of</i><br>
<i>&gt; other selves, that is, non-consensual development, is ownership of other</i><br>
<i>&gt; selves.  Other selves have every right to question this activity and to</i><br>
<i>&gt; bring the activity into the political sphere.  The concepts of</i><br>
guardianship<br>
<i>&gt; and power of attorney evolved in society to champion the rights of</i><br>
<i>&gt; developing selves that are incapable of acting as their own champions....</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Developed is a static concept that I have never observed in living</i><br>
<i>&gt; entities.  Life is always "developing," from conception to death.  Even</i><br>
<i>&gt; with indefinite longevity, no one will ever be "developed," they will</i><br>
<i>&gt; indefinitely be "developing."&gt;</i><br>
<p>
What is the question ???<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This goes unanswered:</i><br>
<i>&gt; RJ: &lt;When you speak of the "source of the rule" all I see is the very</i><br>
<i>&gt; oldest rule of all, "might makes right."  Nature is red in tooth and</i><br>
claw. <br>
<i>&gt; If it is legitimate for the strong to prey upon the weak, sooner or</i><br>
later,<br>
<i>&gt; we will end up, not as a society, but as isolated systems of perfected</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-defense staring at each other across no-man's land.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Am I confusing opinions with questions ???<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; This goes unanswered:</i><br>
<i>&gt; RJ: &lt;What's wrong with commercializing all life, at all stages of</i><br>
<i>&gt; development, including humans, intelligent or otherwise, conscious or</i><br>
<i>&gt; otherwise?  Just make all life into products in the marketplace, all</i><br>
custom<br>
<i>&gt; designed for any use whatsoever?  "If destroying it is acceptable," why</i><br>
<i>&gt; would any use not be, living or dead?&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Intelligent life decides only for it self......or unless it's asked to<br>
decide for<br>
someone else....or if you are "the mother" of an "potential intelligent<br>
information<br>
entity"<br>
<p>
I too can't answer were to draw the line on "animal-use" or "lower<br>
intelligent beings"<br>
for using them, eating them, modifying them. But I think we can answer<br>
these<br>
questions in a democratic way. This will without a doubt lead to some<br>
"wrong"<br>
conclusions. But although I am an idealist, I am also realistic.....if we<br>
look <br>
at the past, I would say we make better judgements day by day....granted:<br>
in<br>
very small steps....and sometimes we even step back........<br>
But I think you don't have the answer as much as I do......And I'll respect<br>
you<br>
for your opinion.....could you at least do the same instead of calling<br>
me a death-worshipper<br>
<p>
