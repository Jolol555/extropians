  Why don't they prohibit alcohol and promote GHB then...  The still better<br>
effects of GHB, IMO, are that next morning you feel more energetic<br>
(due to extra GH secretion) and more optimistic (dopamin release) - the<br>
"positive ideation" together with energy allows you to do more and better.<br>
The effect may last for a day, though, so you'd have to take GHB regularly<br>
to sustain it (not such a bad idea[?]).  Fortunately, the *memory* of the effect<br>
lasts much longer.  If you have various experiences of what your personality<br>
features might be, you start liking some of them, and even identifying with<br>
them - and that's a long-term effect.<br>
<p>
Don't know what Ritalin does...<br>
<p>
  There seem to be many other chemicals that enhance various personality<br>
traits.  Steroids make one more aggressive; psychedelics give appreciation<br>
of sensory perception and artistic skills; Ecstasy dwarfs GHB's empathic<br>
effects, heightens one's feeling of touch, and the next day inhibits your<br>
respect to both internal and social restrictions - good acting-out aid to<br>
a beginning libertarian ;-)  And so on.<br>
Many of these things are risky for health though, or have other side-effects<br>
(such as decreasing cognitive functions).<br>
  Risks have always accompanied exploration.  In this case though, most<br>
of the population tries to attain effects I personally don't value - like building<br>
gigantic muscles or getting stoned at any cost to health and brain function;<br>
the information about use of any combinations of substances for personal<br>
growth is scarce and unreliable.    I assume that mild doses of steroids<br>
may increase one's strength of character and be worth the side effects for<br>
at least some people;  you can find suggestions to supplement mescalin<br>
with DMAE to get the perceptual effects without the loss of cognitive function,<br>
etc.  Some of these things may have only positive effects; others are worth<br>
the mild side-effects, at least for some people; most substances and their<br>
combinations should be avoided by everybody.<br>
  I do not really want to conduct experiments on myself - but I thought<br>
somebody on the list could know something...<br>
