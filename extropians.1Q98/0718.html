 : Im wondering, do the 10 dimensions include the 0 dimension,<br>
 : making 11 total?  (0-point, 1-line, 2-plane, 3-d etc..)<br>
 <br>
 If you like, but the "0 dimension" adds no dimensionality,<br>
 because it has no variation.<br>
 <br>
 The Cartesian product of a line (d=1) and a line (d=1) is a plane (d=2).<br>
 The Cartesian product of a line (d=1) and a point (d=0) is a line (d=1).<br>

<p>
and the product of a point and a point is a line<br>
if a point isnt a dimension and a line is, what is a point?<br>
i very much think that a point is a dimension.  dimensions dont start with a<br>
line, they start with a point i think, or maybe something else.<br>
<p>
if you had three points it would be a plane, and 4 would be 3d    ....(if they<br>
were randomly placed within 3d space, but what if they were randomly placed<br>
within a 4d space?  What is a 4d space? time? it seems that would also include<br>
movement and growth)  It seems a point would exist within all dimensions.<br>
