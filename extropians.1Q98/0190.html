Frozen baboons returned to life<br>
<p>
by Lois Rogers<br>
Medical Correspondent<br>
<p>
<p>
SCIENTISTS have unlocked the secret of suspended animation by<br>
successfully reviving baboons hours after their bodies were packed<br>
into crates of ice.<br>
<p>
The breakthrough, which holds huge implications for the battle<br>
against disease and ageing, will allow humans to preserve their<br>
ice-cold bodies in suspended animation and wake up years later in<br>
the same physical condition.<br>
<p>
It has aroused the interest of space scientists investigating the<br>
possibility of interstellar travel, allowing human exploration of<br>
galaxies many light years away.<br>
<p>
Military clinicians are also attracted by the prospect of allowing<br>
critically injured troops to be near-frozen on the battlefield and<br>
preserved for later treatment.<br>
<p>
The key to the technology is Hextend, a revolutionary plasma<br>
replacement fluid which is poured into the body through a vein in<br>
the upper thigh as blood is drained and the anaesthetised body is<br>
cooled to 1C. As the clear fluid permeates the tissues, it prevents<br>
the deterioration caused by extreme lowering of body temperature.<br>
<p>
The results from the baboon studies, carried out at Biotime, a<br>
California research company, were announced at the annual meeting<br>
of the American Association of Anti-Ageing Medicine.<br>
<p>
Hal Sternberg, Biotime's head of research, said work on the<br>
mechanisms of animal hibernation had provided much of the basic<br>
information on suspended animation.<br>
<p>
One type of North American frog can partially freeze its body while<br>
it shuts down during the winter months. Hamsters have been kept<br>
alive at 1-2C with no heartbeat in Biotime laboratories for up to<br>
seven hours before being successfully rewarmed.<br>
<p>
The long-term objective is to add freeze-protectant chemicals to<br>
the Hextend solution so human bodies can be stored at -196C, the<br>
temperature of liquid nitrogen. The principal barrier, however, is<br>
popular opinion.<br>
<p>
"It is like the public attitude to early organ transplants," said<br>
Sternberg. "Although everyone will love us when we announce we have<br>
reversibly frozen a human being, at the moment this area is not<br>
considered socially acceptable.<br>
<p>
"There is a limit to how far people think you should go to save a<br>
life: but we already have children being born from frozen embryos.<br>
If you are extending the beginning of life, why shouldn't you also<br>
extend it later on?"<br>
<p>
Sternberg and his colleagues expect to use their new techniques to<br>
put themselves into long-term hibernation while they await the<br>
development of life-extending techniques to cure and prevent<br>
cancer, heart failure and Alzheimer's disease.<br>
<p>
Doctors believe the technique can immediately be used in complex<br>
surgery, where best results can be obtained by cooling the body to<br>
a level which would otherwise cause brain damage.<br>
<p>
Clinical trials of Hextend led by Michael Mythen, a consultant<br>
anaesthetist who worked on the project in America, are to begin at<br>
University College hospital, London, this year.<br>
<p>
It will be used in complex orthopaedic, gynaecological and stomach<br>
operations where there is a danger of catastrophic blood loss and<br>
where better results can be obtained at low temperatures.<br>
<p>
Kelvin Brockbank, a British-born scientist in South Carolina who<br>
has received funding from the American government for his research<br>
work in the allied field of preserving transplant organs, said<br>
deep-freezing of human tissue would be possible within a year.<br>
"There will be a whole range of applications for the technology,"<br>
he said. "It will be up to people to decide how to use them."<br>

Did we ever establish an Extropian Investor list?<br>
<p>
Maybe an Extropian in the peoples republic could pay a visit and<br>
report back?<br>
