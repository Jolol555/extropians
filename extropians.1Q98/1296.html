<i>&gt; &gt; Point 1. The laser was not `invented' from the need for new surgical</i><br>

This is wrong at least in part. Radar was developed in a wartime crash<br>
program. Its first major application was anti-aircraft gun aiming <br>
systems. Those old funky wooden buildings on the MIT campus (are they <br>
still there? They were when I was a stoont) were thrown up during the <br>
early years of WWII to house the Research Lab. for Electronics (RLE) in <br>
which a lot of the radar work happened. Norbert Weiner solved the <br>
control problem and opened up the whole field of real-time control <br>
systems (thanks, Norbert! Working on real-time OS at DG was one of the <br>
best times of my checkered career).<br>
<p>
And what, pray tell, was behind the development of ICs besides the need <br>
to miniaturize and standardize circuits? I don't think that was a good <br>
example of pure research that found later application, either, although <br>
examples do abound. And because they do, commercial entities do <br>
sponsor quite a lot of "pure" research, which is probably part of the <br>
refutation you're looking for. IBM, Bellcore, and a few other large <br>
corporate labs have a lot of people doing "pure" research, while <br>
universities in general, including public ones, have a lot of <br>
professors who choose their research areas carefully to maximize useful <br>
patents.<br>
