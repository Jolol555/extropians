<p>
Well, yeah, that's why I didn't respond to that bit.<br>
<p>
Besides, as I see it it, it's not a security issue, it's more a matter of everyone being<br>
able to read mail.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I generally use elm on a linux box, but I'm using my Dad's win95 machine for a</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; to see differing fonts and colours (as if that will make a message more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; intelligible).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That even ascii based browsers like ALPHABrowser now support HTML email indicates</i><br>

<p>
hmm, I wasn't aware of this.  Do you have a url?<br>

<i>&gt; Its people, and their stubborn resistance to change that is the sticking point. As</i><br>

<p>
I entirely agree. However, I really don't think that plain-vanilla ascii email is<br>
"obsolete", and I'm not really sure why HTML is so vastly superior.  All I've seen so<br>
far is the ability to change fonts and colours. Woopee doo is my reaction to that.  It<br>
in no was changes the -content-, merely the presentation.  We're still reading text,<br>
it's just text prettified up slightly.<br>
<p>
I agree with what you are saying in principle, it's just that I don't think it applies<br>
to email. If even one member of the list cannot read HTML, why should the rest of us<br>
exclude this person, when it really serves no valid purpose? Is the ability to mix and<br>
match fonts going to make the list more useful than the opinions/thoughts/rants/agitprop<br>
of that individual?  I doubt it, although suffering through the interminable abortion<br>
thread makes me doubt this conclusion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'd thought that the umlauts in german can be swapped for a following "e"??</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most european accent systems can be replicated in an HTML compatible mail reader by</i><br>
<i>&gt; using tags that specify a standard international character set that is 7 bit, and is</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognised as an alternate font.. Microsoft has several as does DEC. Microsoft</i><br>
<i>&gt; International and DEC Multinational are two that I have come across regularly in</i><br>
<i>&gt; mail data files customers in other countries send me at work for processing. I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand, though, why Germans would use a capital B with a tail as a replacement</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the 'ss' in -strasse ??? Is it a different pronouncement?</i><br>
<p>
No, it's a double s.<br>
