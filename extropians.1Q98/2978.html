If better technology caused faster economic growth, optimism about new <br>
technologies suggests accelerating economic growth rates, perhaps even<br>
becoming so fast as to constitute a "singularity."<br>
<p>
The following analysis suggests, however, that if growth rates are limited<br>
by the average return on investment (ROI), growth rates may be relatively<br>
insensitive to technology, and hence long remain near historical levels. <br>
<p>
The basic argument is this: Interest rates are determined by the supply<br>
and demand for investment resources.  The supply curve seems to be <br>
basically flat at historical rates of 1-3%, and for good evolutionary <br>
reasons.  The demand curve rises with technology, but since there are <br>
effectively no property rights in investment projects, all the demand<br>
curve above the level where supply and demand meet is burned up in a race <br>
to be first.  So ROI should remain near historical rates until some new <br>
technology is so good that, even with most world income being saved <br>
and invested in related projects, the expected ROI for even the least<br>
attractive projects becomes much higher than historical interest rates.<br>
