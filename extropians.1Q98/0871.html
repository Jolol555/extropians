<i>&gt; God's domain and other pious platitudes throughout his book, </i><br>
<i>&gt; it seems to be the custom when discussing such matters, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; Jim is just too original for that and he refuses to pander to the </i><br>

Something (I think) you recently said inspired me to start scribbling<br>
down ideas for a potential screenplay/novel, it was something along<br>
the lines of you not caring if god does exist because he'd still be a<br>
manipulative authority that you have no respect for.  This gave me an<br>
idea - what if all these bible prophecies were true and our creator is<br>
going to come down in the next millennium and wreak havoc on anyone<br>
who hasn't lived their lives according to his word.  We'd have a fight<br>
on our hands, and a big sci-fi summer-release movie style fight at<br>
that.  So hands up anyone who wants to try and sell a movie about<br>
humanities war against God!  Not likely, might stand a chance as a<br>
novel though.<br>
<p>
I love being controversial.<br>
