<i>&gt;  why do you think [the consumption tax proposal] is inane?</i><br>
<p>
I am a tax lawyer here in the United States.  I have analyzed the various tax<br>
proposals (flat tax, consumption tax, national sales tax, VAT, etc. in a<br>
variety of vicissitudes) and have found them wanting.  A consumption tax is<br>
especially distasteful on a variety of fronts.  The central idea that people<br>
get hooked on when talking about replacing the current system is not what its<br>
being replaced with but the fact that its being replaced.  Most Americans hate<br>
the current system so much that they would take anything as substitute for it.<br>
This notion is misguided and unwise.<br>
<p>
A National Consumption Tax (NCT)<br>
<p>
A NCT sounds great when generalities are discussed.  It would reward saving and<br>
penalize consumption.  The capital generated from the additional savings would<br>
allow the economy to grow and so on.  But when this proposal is analyzed in<br>
detail it becomes obvious how completely ridiculous it is from a real-world<br>
standpoint.  For the NCT to raise as much revenue as the current income tax<br>
system, it would have to tax final sales at a rate of 28% (this rate does not<br>
incorporate the need to also raise funds that payroll taxes currently<br>
generate).  This is higher than many NCT advocates quote, but that is because<br>
their proposals include huge cuts in federal spending.  But there is a deeper<br>
problem with this 28% figure and that is the tax base that is used in deriving<br>
that rate.  The 28% rate would have to be imposed on every single expenditure<br>
by individuals.  This means that individuals would have to pay 28% tax on<br>
groceries, rent, house payments, automobiles, gas, auto repairs, donations to<br>
charitable organizations, health care, etc.  Everything.  Many proposals exempt<br>
several of the aforementioned categories from tax.  All this does is increase<br>
the necessary rate on the remaining taxable expenditures.  If you exclude<br>
"necessities" then you end up with a rate of 63% on all remaining<br>
expenditures.  So when you go to buy that $5,000 P6-300mhz computer,<br>
remember... it will cost you over $8,000.<br>
<p>
Regardless of the rate, there is another crucial problem with the rate that is<br>
initially determined.  The tax will reduce the amount people buy.  If you could<br>
buy $100 worth of "things" before the NCT and the NCT is 30%, you will only be<br>
able to buy $75 worth of "things" now.  Sure you'll have more money because you<br>
will not be paying income taxes but the average American pays only 16% federal<br>
taxes.  16% is lower than any estimate of the NCT rate needed meaning consumer<br>
demand will diminish.  What does this mean?  Tax revenues will go down which<br>
will result in higher NCT rates (which will consequently diminish spending<br>
more) or an explosion of the federal deficit (which will gobble up all the<br>
extra capital generated by the NCT and then some).<br>
<p>
The real push behind this is by ultra-wealthy individuals who would benefit<br>
from the NCT.  Steve Forbes would (based on his current financial position)<br>
save over $1 billion in federal taxes over his lifetime if the NCT was<br>
implemented.  No wonder he supports it and is willing to spend millions to get<br>
it implented.  Wealthy individuals, generally, do not consume most of their<br>
income.  They invest it.  Thus the tax burden on the wealthy will plummet while<br>
the tax burden on the lower and middle classes will increase dramatically.  The<br>
NCT will become an extremely regressive tax and have a severe negative impact<br>
on the economy.<br>
<p>
Ask any NCT proponent this question:  Why not simply the tax code in this<br>
manner:  Create a flat rate of 40% with a universal exemption of $100,000.<br>
This would reduce the tax code to a couple of pages and raise the same amount<br>
of revenue that the currrent system creates.  Consumer demand would skyrocket<br>
as hundreds of billions of dollars is put back in the hands of the lower and<br>
middle class thus creating wealth for the upper class.  They will balk at such<br>
a plan because it does one thing:  Raises the tax burden on the wealthy.<br>
