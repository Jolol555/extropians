What I've heard from graphite-coated steel balls (can't asess the truth,<br>
since coming from an electronic source -- probably the nanotech archives,<br>
yet plausible-sounding), they survived just fine.<br>
<p>
The typical inertia-confined nuke uses a massive metal lining to confine<br>
the fissible device kernal during about one the microsecond the nuclear<br>
reaction takes to completion (don't know much about thermonuclear weapons<br>
just now). Accompanying release of neutrons (anybody know the typical<br>
concentration?) flashes throught the device, and, getting absorbed, heats<br>
it quite suddenly. After that by many absorbance/reradiation steps the<br>
entire device turns into a more-or-less homogenous (?) ball of dense<br>
plasma of roughly 20-100 MK, which radiates mostly in the Xray region.<br>
Ignoring the effects of air, the graphite coated steel balls (few ten m<br>
from ground zero) experience assymetric explosive ablation due to absorbed<br>
EM radiation, and hence a strong acceleration. (It is probably not a good<br>
idea for human observers to persist up to this stage). If ever the spheres<br>
get engulfed by a nuke fireball, then at a much later, milder stage.<br>
<p>
Don't ask me about the exact size, location, and composition of these<br>
spheres, and on their weight loss after the experience, though. <br>

Well, ok, I have to admit that I'd rather be pretty far away from any such<br>
business. There is always some nonzero chance you wind up playing ground<br>
zero, and you can suffer death from explosive decompression due to<br>
hermetic hull puncture by debris, rad sickness (neutron nukes), etc. War<br>
is only fun in a movie, or in a theoretical treatise. Imo, the more<br>
theoretical, the better.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; get hit by a shock wave caused by the pressure of matter, but you would have </i><br>
<i>&gt; to worry about the enormous shock from radiation pressure. We usually think</i><br>
<p>
That would seem to assume the event is pretty close. The good thing about<br>
space habitats, especially orbiting ones, is that there is/have to be<br>
plenty of space inbetween. Your eggs are most assuredly not in a single<br>
basket.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; of radiation pressure as being very weak, after all, we'd need a solar sail</i><br>
<i>&gt; miles across to slowly accelerate a small space ship, the feebleness is </i><br>
<i>&gt; partly because the sun has a small angular size near the Earth but mostly </i><br>
<i>&gt; because the of the sun is so cold, less than 10,000 degrees at the surface. </i><br>
<i>&gt; When things get really hot the pressure becomes astronomical, literally </i><br>
<i>&gt; astronomical, because just a small increase in temperature means a huge </i><br>
<i>&gt; increase in radiation pressure, the two are related to the FOURTH power.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the very few things I remember from my Atkins, the energy radiated by</i><br>
a blackbody is proportional to T^4. However, the emission maximum gets<br>
shifted to short wavelengths with higher temperature, which makes matter<br>
far from being a perfect reflector/absorber. So you've got quite a few mm<br>
of material suddenly heated, comparatively slowly exploding into space. <br>
Moreover the effect is brief, the nuke fireball in space cooling very<br>
rapidly, I'd hazard a roughly exponential decay of the temperature.  Also,<br>
assuming wide habitat separation, on the average that means a few km<br>
between me and ground zero.<br>
<p>
I wouldn't want to face a nuke from that close while on a spacewalk (btw,<br>
anybody knows whatever happened to these NASA study suits made from<br>
several layers of thin rubber instead of bulky constant-volume-joint<br>
monsters which are used now?), but it sounds highly survivable while<br>
sitting in a large space habitat, shielded by several m of mineral/metal. <br>
It would be interesting to assess the impacts of a deep-burrowing nuke<br>
exploding in a few-km asteroid/comet kernal, the low density of the<br>
material considered. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you heat up a tin can to temperature T the Black Body radiation pressure  </i><br>
<i>&gt; inside the can is 1/3 [QT^4] , Q is the  radiation constant  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 7.56591* 10^-15 erg cm-3 Kelvin -4 . If you heated up the can to 90,000,000  </i><br>
<i>&gt; degrees the radiation pressure inside the  can would be equal to the total </i><br>
<i>&gt; pressure found at the center of the sun!   Yes your target wouldn't be </i><br>
<i>&gt; completely enveloped and would only receive the radiation from one side, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; on the other hand, an H bomb can produce temperatures well over 200,000,000 </i><br>
<i>&gt; degrees, and the shock would be further enhanced because the outer layer of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the target would vaporize and rocket outward and because momentum is </i><br>
<i>&gt; conserved the inner parts would rocket inward.</i><br>
<p>
Nothing new, so far.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Incidentally, without radiation pressure an H bomb wouldn't work, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; radiation from the fission trigger is the only way to compress deuterium </i><br>
<i>&gt; enough to achieve fusion. You might think that photons of light couldn't </i><br>
<i>&gt; evenly compress matter because of Rayleigh - Taylor instability, that's what </i><br>
<i>&gt; would happen if you tried to support heavy mercury with a column of water, </i><br>
<i>&gt; tiny tongs of mercury would force their way a small way into the water and </i><br>
<i>&gt; then grow exponentially until the mercury had entirely fallen through the </i><br>
<i>&gt; water. It's not at all obvious that the same thing wouldn't happen with light </i><br>
<i>&gt; and matter, however detailed calculations by the military on the largest</i><br>
<i>&gt; super computers of their day showed that this instability does not happen, </i><br>
<i>&gt; photons really can compress matter evenly. This fact was kept top secret for </i><br>
<i>&gt; many years, and when it was finally revealed, after painstakingly piecing it </i><br>
<i>&gt; together in the early 1980's from hundreds of unclassified documents and </i><br>
<i>&gt; after several people nearly went to jail, astronomers found it very </i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting.</i><br>
<p>
All very true, but really not applicable to my scenario described above. I<br>
must play Dr. Strangelove's flamboyant rodeo to really experience the<br>
dramatic effects you've just described. Antimatter pellets fired from a<br>
matter catapult into a small spacecraft would probably demonstrate such<br>
effects. <br>
<p>
Btw, anybody knows what the highest achieved current in a proton<br>
accelerator was? According data for record particle density in a neutral<br>
jet?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The interior of the sun is at a chilly 14 million degrees so radiation </i><br>
<i>&gt; pressure is not very important, the gas pressure is about 1700 times greater,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; the same is true for most stars but not all, it is vitally important in  </i><br>
<i>&gt; super giantstars, supernovas, the accretion cloud around Black Holes, and in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the H bomb it's the entire ball game.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;What we should worry right now are not nukes nor nerve agents, but       </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;engineered bioweapons (mostly viruses, not bacteriological bioweapons). </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That does worry me, another thing that worries me are the thousands of H bombs </i><br>
<i>&gt; in the former USSR guarded by angry unhappy men who drink too much and make </i><br>
<i>&gt; about a thousand dollars a year.</i><br>
<p>
All true, but these poor blokes haven't got the arming codes. Assuming the<br>
command-control structure is still centralistic, and the arming procedure<br>
is similiar to the U.S. model, the launch commands must come from someone<br>
standing pretty high in the hierarchy. Which, of course, doesn't mean it<br>
can't happen. <br>
<p>
Furthermore, the time fortunately works for us. As in the west, the<br>
devices have not been designed to be recyclable. Aged nukes don't have<br>
deterministic yield anymore (and are more dirty), nukes gone sour are<br>
highly unreliable. Modern high-performance nukes, being high-tuned<br>
devices, do not age gracefully. <br>
<p>
While the nuke dangers are admittedly nonnegliegeable, the militant<br>
molecular biologist Friends of the Earth or the walking virus bombs from<br>
Jihad Unltd. scenario does worry me significantly more. Then the shit<br>
hitting the fan always tends to hit you from an unexpected angle...<br>
