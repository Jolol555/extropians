We placed an ad in one small area of the Internet.  And when<br>
the dust started to settle we had over six thousand responses<br>
in ten days.<br>

For Immediate Release:   Denver, Feb 27, 1998<br>
<p>
COLORADO  MARKETING  FIRM  SHARES  MONEY<br>
GENERATING  TRADE  SECRETS  ON  THE  INTERNET!<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
<p>
Hello,<br>
<p>
My Name is Shannon Johnson.  I am CEO of The Advantage Group.  <br>
I have to tell you that I am really angry and upset about what is going <br>
on here on the Internet.  We at The Advantage Group are so angry, <br>
in fact, that we decided to do something about it.  Read on and you'll see.<br>
<p>
For three years I have lead my marketing firm in sales campaigns on<br>
the Internet and the other large online services which have yielded<br>
outstanding results!  We are now sharing the information we have<br>
gained over the last several years with other people who are desperately<br>
trying to figure out how to make a substantial income from their home<br>
computers.<br>
<p>
Do you know what it's like to turn your computer on in the morning to<br>
find an email box full of orders for your product.....Where it takes over<br>
an hour to sift through just the credit card orders alone?<br>
We do!<br>
<p>
Do you know what it's like to have the postman bring you a bag full of<br>
orders for products you have marketed on the Internet, and then hear<br>
him complain about all the mail you get?<br>
We do!<br>
<p>
Do you know what it's like to place a simple ad into a newsgoup or<br>
classified section on the Internet and have your Order Department's<br>
phone ring off the hook with people who want to buy your product.<br>
We do!<br>
<p>
Have you ever placed just one advertisement on the Ineternet and when<br>
the dust settled ten days later had over 6,000 responses by phone,<br>
fax, mail, and email?<br>
Well....we did in January of this year!<br>
<p>
Have you ever tried to market something simple on the Internet, only<br>
to have weeks or months of toil and effort result in only a few sales,<br>
if any?<br>
Well....that's happened to us too.  But not since we learned the secrets!!!<br>
<p>
You see, we found the "secrets" to marketing just about anything on<br>
the Internet.  And it is really quite simple, once you know them.<br>
<p>
Imagine this.  You decide to make a second, or even a primary<br>
income from the Internet.  So, you put up a Web Site, get a mess<br>
of email follow-up letters ready, put your Web Site in several hundred<br>
search engines (people gotta find your page...right), get in the News-<br>
Groups and advertise your site, and drop hundreds of classified ads<br>
all over the Net.  There ya go.....now you are going to rake in the cash!<br>
Two weeks later you have one sale and you are telling your spouse<br>
and your friends that "This will take time! "  Four months later you've<br>
made just enough to pay for your web space and your friends don't<br>
listen to you anymore.  They consider you an "Internet Marketer<br>
Wanna Be".  Sound familiar!<br>
<p>
We are not trying to rub salt in your wounds.  What we are trying to<br>
do is let you in on the TRUTH about doing business from your home<br>
on the Internet. Let's face it.  The vast majority of people who are<br>
trying to earn a living on the Internet are STARVING!!!  That's right!<br>
They don't have a clue of what to do first, second, third or fourth!  And<br>
even if they do have a clue they have been lead down the garden path<br>
with dreams and silly techniques which don't work and are breaking<br>
the hearts of thousands of people who are just trying to make a living<br>
from their home computers.  That is what we are so upset about at<br>
The Advantage Group!<br>
<p>
But, it doesn't have to be that way!  People don't have to really FAIL at<br>
making a good income on the Internet.  And it really doesn't have to<br>
take months or even years to learn how to do it.  Not if you have the<br>
right guide to show you what to do, and when to do it.<br>
<p>
    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)<br>
<p>
is the name of our informative guide to generating orders, money, cash,<br>
on the Net.  It was written with the "average" Netrepreneur in mind, in<br>
plain English, with straight to the point "How To" and "Why Do You Do"<br>
phraseology.<br>
<p>
In......<br>
<p>
    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)<br>
<p>
we expose all the traps WE fell into in our first year of Internet Marketing,<br>
but stay away from now.  We expose the lies and half truths which people<br>
have fallen for in the past.  We expose the SECRETS which most of the<br>
successful Internet Marketers really DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW!<br>
Because, when you know the secrets you will be off and running in...<br>
that's right......THEIR BACKYARD....the Cyberspace Marketplace!<br>
<p>
THERE IS ROOM FOR A LOT MORE OF US!<br>
<p>
There are millions of people on the Internet.  And there are millions<br>
of more people on the way here.  The pie which will be cut up is<br>
so huge that several hundred more people who know what they are<br>
doing will not even make a dent in our income level. It will just be a<br>
drop in the bucket so to speak.<br>
<p>
    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)<br>
<p>
will expose the Internet for what it really is, the marketplace which<br>
can provide you with a steady income.  It will literally show you what<br>
to do first, second, third, fourth, and so on.<br>
<p>
You are about to discover exactly what makes the difference between<br>
the "Internet success stories," and the obscure "Web Marketing Failures."<br>
<p>
This guide will give you all the details, the tools,  the ideas, and the<br>
resources to help you make all of your INTERNET DREAMS come true...<br>
<p>
Finally, the truth is revealed!  Find out the secrets that some of the<br>
wealthiest Internet marketers are using to propel their sales through the<br>
Cyberspace roof.<br>
<p>
    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)<br>
<p>
Will show you:<br>
<p>
** How to use Newsgroups to your advantage.  The tricks!<br>
Just placing a few ads just won't do it for you!<br>
<p>

you write your Sig correctly it can be a GOLD MINE to you. We generate<br>

<p>
Here is what some people who turned their Internet Marketing<br>
results from failure to success have to say about "The Guide":<br>
<p>
I thought all I had to do was place some classified ads on the Net for<br>
my flame retarding spray.  Every night after work I would place a<br>
few ads and answer some questions in email.  I never made much<br>
money at all.  Then I read THE GUIDE and everything turned around!<br>
I'm looking at leaving my job now.  And their newsletter keeps me up<br>
to date with all the new things I need to know to keep on track with<br>
my business.<br>
<p>

<p>
I started Internet Marketing in the Chat Rooms on AOL.  What<br>
a joke that was!  Nobody ever told me it would take so long to<br>
make any money that way.  Then I read the 'The Guide." The<br>
Chat Rooms, Internet Newsgroups, Web Sites, and email all<br>
make me money now.  And it wasn't all that hard either.  I just<br>
didn't know the secrets before.  But I do now!!!  The Internet is<br>
huge, and I've just started getting my share!<br>

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)<br>
<p>
is usually only offered to our marketing clients.  With all the garbage<br>
we have seen on the Internet in the past few months we have decided<br>
to offer "The Guide" to everyone reading this advertisement.  Our clients<br>
have paid $99.95 for "The Guide" and have felt that it was a real bargain<br>
for that price.  "The Guide" has now gone into it SECOND Edition and<br>
we feel that we should open it up to just about anyone's financial budget.<br>
At least for a limited time.<br>
<p>
    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)<br>
<p>
is being offered to you, for a limited time, for only $29.95!!!  That's<br>
correct!  That's a full $70 off the regular price.  Once a reasonable amount <br>
of orders  have been placed at this price we will take "The Guide"<br>
off of the sale counter and move the price back to $99.95.  But, why<br>
offer this for such a deep discount?  It's simple.  The Advantage Group<br>
feels that the time is right for this information to become more available<br>
on the Net.  But we aren't marketing fools either. The Guide holds a<br>
Copyright, and will only be offered at this very deeply discounted price<br>
for a very limited time.<br>
<p>
(There is some Joker on the Net who is trying to sell LESS information<br>
without our two bonus offers to follow for $395.00.  That is ridiculous!!!)<br>
<p>
FIRST BONUS OFFER:<br>
<p>
If you order within the next 3 days we will include:<br>
