to<br>

the<br>

I'm not completely sure how you apply the term "violate" to a person. <br>
If you mean "violate their rights" then I have to presume you're<br>
refering their rights as seen by you, as it is a purely subjective<br>
term.  A contract should be enforce by all who would benefit from it,<br>
and again I see no reason to think that all contracts *must* be<br>
fufilled.  I certainly wouldn't call it "bad" - even when I blieved in<br>
the concept.<br>
