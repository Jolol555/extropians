If there is a trend towards permeating our habitat with nosyware, a<br>
sudden fashion for face masks, flowing robes (is also great to conceal <br>
sharp threads (=kevlar), and EM-shield your wearable), neutral gaits<br>
or even totally anonymous teleremote bots should emerge. Interesting<br>
what strong state minions would make from it -- for harassing<br>
pedestrian X can suddenly become a dangerous job.<br>
 <br>
I have long wanted to create a thread with a Subject: like monkey, <br>
turbocharged, or, augmented ape (the latter shamelessly plagiarized,<br>
of course). Whadya think?<br>
<p>
I have a number of ideas how one could start a DIY wearable project, which<br>
would be 1) doable 2) affordable 3) really make a difference to an unaugmented<br>
mehum, protection gadgetry inclusive. Hopefully this topic will prove<br>
itself more accessable the bootstrapping lunatics.<br>
<p>
Shall we hold the discussion here, or on transhumantech@ ?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Apropos this interesting subject, I have heard that there are many</i><br>
<i> &gt; buildings in Holland deliberately surrounded by low hedges and with</i><br>
<i> &gt; large vindows allowing passers-by to see in, apparently part of some</i><br>
<i> &gt; kind of "we have absolutely nothing to hide" memeset. Is this true, or</i><br>
<i> &gt; just a misobservation from my source?</i><br>
