 <br>
Yes. Top-down control doesn't work well, except in situations where there's<br>
a clearly-defined goal to work towards -- which is not a characteristic of<br>
society at large.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But if political power is not concentrated, what people actually do </i><br>

 <br>
Er, yeah. And what's the goal of most of the participants? (Could it<br>
be, by any chance, the centralization of power? If for no other<br>
reason than the sentiment expressed in the old adage about shit sandwiches.)<br>
<p>

<p>
On the contrary. Why do people try to wheel and deal? Nobody holds a gun<br>
to their heads and says "you're gonna be a good capitalist todauy, boy,<br>
or I'm sending you to the People's Number Four Holiday Camp for<br>
re-education in Proper Corporate Behaviour," do they?  (Well, actually<br>
they _do_, in this here wonderful country -- the UK -- or at least<br>
that's what the government seems to be trying to do. But that's a rant<br>
of a different stripe ...) No: the reason people try to engage in<br>
free-market exchanges is because those exhanges seem to be beneficial to<br>
them. And usually they are, although this ain't invariably the case if<br>
one of the parties to the transaction is determined to rip off the<br>
other.<br>
<p>
This last point is important. You can argue until you're blue in the<br>
face that a free market is best, but unless you can ensure that it<br>
_stays_ a free market -- and functions properly, without abuse by the<br>
participants -- then you've got problems. (I classify as 'abuse'<br>
activities where one participant defrauds, suckers, or otherwise<br>
exploits another without their willing connivance. This includes <br>
attempts to establish a monopoly or manipulate the market itself <br>
in order to skew the 'level playing field'. Any problems with this <br>
working definition?)<br>
<p>
Now, as someone else pointed out here recently:<br>
<p>
	People are stooopid.<br>
<p>
Most people are bad as assessing risks. They tend to value short-term<br>
limited gain over long-term benefits. They view disastrous but rare<br>
risks as being more dangerous than smaller-scale but more common risks<br>
(for example, airliner crashes against car crashes).<br>
<p>
It's usually in your best interests to cooperate with other people,<br>
assuming they don't defect; but most people can be tempted into<br>
defecting by a prospect of short-term gain. This leads to the problem of<br>
common goods;   areas where it's in your interests if everyone else<br>
cooperates, but where it's also in your interests to defect.<br>
<p>
A pure market system doesn't recognize most commons because they don't <br>
have any component that's amenable to trade. If you introduce something<br>
that can be traded -- say, air polution permits that lets you emit CO2 --<br>
well, you can apply market economics to a commons problem (in this case,<br>
air polution). But to do so you've had to dilute the purity of essence<br>
of your market by essentially imposing a control on polution (that forces<br>
people to buy polution permits before they can emit CO2). Ergo, a<br>
big problem. Markets can't work in a vacuum ...<br>
