  You can be unhappy punishing anybody, but the criminals will also be<br>
unhappy.  That's the point - their unhappiness with the punishment will<br>
prevent them from committing [more] crime.<br>
<p>

punishment         <br>

<p>

<i>&gt;old 300 pound Olympic weight lifter and a 82 year old 89 pound grandmother </i><br>

<i>&gt;people for minor crimes and giving virtually no punishment to others who </i><br>
<i>&gt;commit major ones.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
  10 year jail sentence for these people will also be perceived differently.<br>
And so will forced abstinence from sex, prison environment, solitude,<br>
separation from family, etc.  Calibrating people's psychological <br>
perceptions does sound like an insurmountable problem, but it is never<br>
taken into account.  Calibrating physical effects, such as tiredness and<br>
pain, is extremely easy compared to that.  So by your very argument, we<br>
should abandon all other types of punishment in favor of the corporal.<br>
<p>
Besides, if the punishment is known in advance, and you think that it's<br>
too harsh on you personally, then you don't have to commit that crime, right?<br>
If you do, it's your own choice - maybe you thought that though the<br>
punishment for you is more severe, but the chances to get caught and convicted<br>
are smaller (we can't calibrate that for people).  So you made a free conscious<br>
choice, and now get the promised payoff.  It will also be a lesson to others<br>
not<br>
to do it.  Why do you thing old ladies commit fewer crimes ?  ;-)<br>
