Slapping the word "private" on to something doesn't make it any less<br>
centralist (that's what *they* would like you to believe :-), the<br>
concept of the 'road' is a very centralist notion.  Planning in<br>
general is centralist.<br>

<p>
I'm not entirely sure what a 'boom' or 'bust' would look like in a<br>
non-monetary system that had no specific goal (i.e. the systems goal<br>
is a result of the goals of the individuals involved.)  Would progress<br>
stop?  What is 'progress' anyway? The aim of a decentralised system is<br>
that the whole system cannot crash unless every component crashes -<br>
something that would be very hard to do.<br>

<p>
I'm not too familiar with the history behind this, but I wonder whom<br>
they were fixing it for.  When something goes "out of control" that's<br>
generally another way of saying "makes life harder."  And when a<br>
system gets a little chaotic (for better or worse) someone's their to<br>
step in to control it (for better or worse.)<br>

<i>&gt; Ah, like Mr. Halperin's devices from _The First </i><br>

<p>
I haven't read it, but as I understand it, he used some kind of<br>
voluntary surveillance for the greater good.  Mines more real-time<br>
autobiographical publishing for selfish greed.<br>
