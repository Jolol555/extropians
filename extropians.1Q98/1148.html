There will always be money (or some medium of exchange) because there will always be more desirable and less desirable places to live ("live" in whatever<br>
contradictory senses as things diversify and evolve).<br>
<p>
Government (in the sense of an accepted mechanism for arbitration with the power to enforce its rulings, if nothing else) will always have a use.<br>
<p>
Taxes, in one form or another, seem to cover pretty well any way you can think of paying for government.<br>
