In a message dated 98-01-30 22:45:05 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 That resource is creativity.<br>
 <br>
 And to pay for creativity, another resource which can already be <br>
 produced in very large quantities with essentially no resource input <br>
 but which, it appears, we will also never have enough of:<br>
 <br>
 respect. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
Some years ago James Hogan wrote a novel which addressed this concept.  I was<br>
greatly impressed by it and think it has significant bearing on a MNT future.<br>
If memory serves it was entitle "Voyage to Tommorow" or something similar. <br>
<p>
The "currency" was respect and the commodity was creativity.  <br>
