<i>&gt; From:          "Mark D. Fulwiler" &lt;mfulwiler@earthlink.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You may be correct that there are better alternatives to giving a</i><br>
<i>&gt; kid a few whacks in most cases. However, I still think it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; appropriate in cases of really bad behavior when all else has</i><br>
<i>&gt; failed.</i><br>
<p>
Our premise was that causing physical pain was sometimes justified <br>
when the kid did something likely to cause physical damage -- to <br>
herself (since both our kids are female) or to others, but very <br>
rarely in any other case.<br>
<p>
So when a kid pried a safety cap out of an electrical outlet and <br>
started probing with other devices -- we were determined that there <br>
*would* be real, unpleasant physical consequences to her, but also <br>
that the *natural* consequences were unacceptable in their <br>
unpredictability and potential severity.<br>
<p>
(On the other hand, we never spanked our kids with anything other <br>
than the open hand.  We figure that with a belt, if you really *know* <br>
how hard you are hitting, you are getting too much practice.)<br>
