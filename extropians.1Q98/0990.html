hara ra was overheard to say:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It takes a minimum of 5 years for a gummint to discover what's happening with</i><br>
<i>&gt;new stuff and attempt to shut it down. </i><br>
<p>
Five years?<br>
<p>
My favorite author, Vernor Vinge, at one time put forth a theory.  To<br>
summarize, hoping not to mangle it too badly, it is as follows.<br>
<p>
The power of government in growing...BUT....the power of individuals (thanks<br>
to technological advance) is growing at a FASTER RATE.<br>
<p>
To illustrate the point.<br>
<p>
Pick any area of interest. ( Communications, weapons, medicine,<br>
transportation...dairy farming....etc.) There is a time frame sometime in the<br>
not-too-distant past to which  it could be argued that a reasonably affluent<br>
individual of today..(the further in the past you go...the less<br>
affluent).....is NATION EQUIVALENT. <br>
<p>
That is:<br>
<p>
Transportation: I...an individual, own a truck...a tractor-trailer<br>
rig,...which has roughly the cargo capacity of any one of Christopher<br>
Colombus's ships,(48,000 lbs. due to government imposed restrictions...actual<br>
capacity is MUCH greater)... and it took the Nation of Spain to fund his<br>
expedition. True...I only have one truck.(and I DID use a bank to fund<br>
it...but some truckers don't...they pay cash)..and spain had many ships...but<br>
some individuals today have MANY trucks....Schnieder for example(which I<br>
beleive is NOT a public stock company)  has about 12,000. Did the Spain of<br>
Chris's time have that many ships?  To compound this analogy  (which struck me<br>
because I DO own a truck)...shipping now, as then, is the most effecient form<br>
of transportation (for non time-critical cargo).  I beleive that some<br>
individuals of today own ships...compare them to Spain's ships of that era.  I<br>
wouldn't be suprised to discover that ONE cargo ship of today could carry as<br>
much freight as all of the historical Spain's ships  put together...and<br>
probably need less men to operate...than ONE of the Spainish ships.  (might be<br>
wrong here..due to government imposed sanctions forcing the dispersion of<br>
individual wealth...and  thus the ascendency of corporations....but go back in<br>
time FAR enough...and I'm right)<br>
<p>
Communications: I...an individual, am at this moment  preparing a<br>
communication which will shortly be available to individuals in several<br>
different countries....surely as great a number of countries as it took the<br>
resources of the British Empire....only a couple of centuries ago....to<br>
likewise communicate with.  But my communication takes less minutes to reach<br>
it's destination(s) than the British Empire's took months. (now conside Ted<br>
Turner)<br>
<p>
Weapons?:  An individual of today...armed with weapons(s) available within his<br>
price range would be the match for an army of how long ago?  Three<br>
hundred...four hundred years...perhaps longer? (governments have always<br>
been...and remain...REAL GOOD at killing..especialy killing women and<br>
children...like at Ruby Ridge or Waco)  I strongly suspect that an L.A.<br>
gangbanger with an AK-47 could take out a Roman Legion...(as long as he didn't<br>
run out of ammo).<br>
<p>
Computer Programming.   My two year old grandson is an expert "electronic<br>
media entertainment facilitator" (he's a whiz with the VCR and the remote)<br>
better than the whole WORLD of less than a century ago...of course the world<br>
of a century ago didn't have VCR's, Television and remotes....which is the<br>
point.<br>
<p>
&lt;These (spur of the minute) examples may not be EXACTLY correct..your milage<br>
may vary....but I beleive that overall they  correctlly illustrate an<br>
(historically) observable trend.&gt;<br>
<p>
  <br>
This implies that sometime in the rapidly approaching future governments<br>
become extinct....&lt;the sooner the better&gt;..since corrupt as they are...they<br>
could NEVER compete on an equal basis with an individual or small<br>
group..todays's "war on drugs" in the US  for example. (communication lag for<br>
one thing..as well as laziness, stupidity, indecisiveness...and overall<br>
ineptitude)...like all bullies they require the use &lt;or threat&gt;  of<br>
overwhelming force to maintain their position, and inefficient use for that<br>
matter, (HOW many bullets to kill one Viet Cong? HOW many thousand of tons of<br>
bombs?...how much money spent)  to win. (or in the case of Viet Nam...to<br>
loose..)<br>
<p>
(A small country fighting a much larger country to a standstill....and then<br>
the larger country running like a scalded dog.   It's happened twice that I'm<br>
aware of....Viet Nam and Afghanistan..poor countries...paupers really ...and<br>
it took  a Coalition of countries to slap down (down but not out) a RICH small<br>
country....  Iran.....hmmmmmm.)<br>
<p>
This  implies an increasing "Balkanization"...as governments  break up into<br>
smaller and smaller pieces in order to improve their response time.    The<br>
first of which may have been the Soviet Union ....once the largest government<br>
on earth &lt;land area&gt; recently disintergrated. Perhaps the significant attempts<br>
of secession by Quebec in Canada...as well as a province in Spain &lt;can't<br>
remember it's name right now...the one with the  language unrelated to it's<br>
neighbors&gt;..a semi serious effort on the part of california and texas to<br>
"fission" into three and five states respectively are other examples of the<br>
balkanization process in the early stages.<br>
<p>
Five years did you say?  How many years  was it a decade ago, twenty years<br>
ago?  Can a curve be established? (WHEN can I break out the Champagne?)<br>
