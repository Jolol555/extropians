<i>&gt;&gt; Note: the Rev Falwell used to have a place (don't know if it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; still open) where unwed pregnant teens could stay untill their</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; babies were born, they were then (the babies) put up for adoption.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Monstrous....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly why is it monstrous for immature teenage mothers to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; encouraged to put their babies up for adoption where they can be raised</i><br>
<i>&gt; in two parent homes with more mature people? I think it is idiotic for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; teenage girl to think she is doing the best thing for her child (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; herself) by trying to raise it without a father.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; I never thought I would agree with Jerry Falwell on anything!</i><br>
<p>
Sounds like a good idea to me too; I can't imagine why anyone<br>
would think that offering young mothers this option was a bad<br>
thing in any way.  Now I do understand why some people would<br>
have a problem with the "pregnancy counseling clinics" set up<br>
by fundies that only counsel what the church approves of--that<br>
is being less than honest.  But if such an organization clearly<br>
acknowledges its religious affiliation, more power to them.<br>
It's not as if clinics like Planned Parenthood don't also have<br>
a strong religious bias--though pragmatism isn't generally<br>
recognized as the religious doctrine it is.<br>
