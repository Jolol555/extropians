This is an interesting point, but I don't think that it may be the case<br>
fore everyone. When I was in my early 20's, I spent a lot of my free time<br>
experimenting. As soon as it began seriously interfering with my the<br>
stability of my life, I moved on. I think that hemp falls into its own<br>
unique category. I wouldn't consider myself a casual user of this drug. Its<br>
important to me to keep usage connected to the creative process. I'm not<br>
saying that I use it when I want to be creative, but that sometimes, when<br>
it feels like a good idea, I'll indulge. In a way, it is very decedent. But<br>
then again, so is eating fine food.<br>
