<p>
&lt;&lt; but I  think "dynamic realism" would do the faithful better.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I resent this.<br>
<p>
  For a number of reasons.  To begin with the word "faithful" implies some<br>
kind of liberal slavish devotion to the party line.  Or a relegious fervor.  I<br>
try to avoid both cases andattempt to  view facts logically and make a<br>
decesion so based.  <br>
<p>
Secondly.  Why tie it to the death of Julian Simon?  Some people are sad (I<br>
among them) that he is gone.  It is an innappropriate time to trot out your<br>
relegious liberal dogma.<br>
<p>
Thirdly.  Such tripe shows that you have not read any of his works.  Julian<br>
Simon was noted for drawing conclusions from FACTS.  Anything and Everything<br>
he said he had document to the hilt.  Unlike the liberals he DID let mere<br>
facts get in the way of a "warm and fuzzy" dogma.<br>
<p>
<p>
To reply to your rant:<br>
<p>
 &lt;No one can honestly deny the environmental devestation we have wrecked on<br>
the planet, <br>
<p>
I can ...and do.  as many on the list are aware...I travel extensively.  In<br>
excess of a hundred thousand miles a year.  Not air miles either.  "Up close<br>
and personal...on the ground"....I see no evidence of the oft touted<br>
"enviromental devastation". <br>
<p>
Dixie Lee Rhea (former director of the Atomic Energy Commission) wrote two<br>
books on this subject. The title of one is "Trashing the Planet" in which she<br>
documents some of this silliness.<br>
<p>
&lt;the many species we have driven to extinction, &gt;<br>
<p>
species have a finite lifespan...perhaps you are blaming "us" ( I don't recall<br>
driving a species to extinction personally...) for something that occurs<br>
naturally.<br>
<p>
&lt;global warming,&gt;<br>
<p>
a political issue....based upon computer models that, given all relevant data,<br>
cannot even accurately predict the PAST. In other words they don't even have<br>
20/20 hindsight.  Physical data suggests that golobal cooling is more likely. <br>
<p>
 &lt;pollution,&gt;<br>
<p>
One species pollution is another species "natural resource"...once again I<br>
commend to you the works of the man you degrade.<br>
<p>
 &lt;and cancer.&gt;  <br>
<p>
That's pretty much of a leap of faith on your part.  IMHO cancer is as natural<br>
as bad breath.  There is evidence to suggest that it has always been<br>
around...and that it becomes more probable  with age.  We live longer now so<br>
the "degenerative " diseases are more noticed.<br>
<p>
&lt;You can't shrug that off as being "doom and gloom".&gt;<br>
<p>
I can...and do.  Read Julian Simon's "Wired" article.<br>
<p>
&lt; It's reality like it or not.&gt;<br>
<p>
It is NOT !<br>
<p>
<p>
 &lt;&lt;And as I receall, even Simon didn't say destroying Nature was a good<br>
 thing. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
At least you got that part right.<br>
<p>
<p>
And along the same vein Paul Hughes commented.<br>
<p>
&lt;Although I agree with your overall outlook James, can anyone argue that <br>
we have had a *gain* in biodiversity?  Over the years I've looked pretty <br>
hard for evidence in the literature of any new species coming into <br>
existence in the past 100 years. As far as I know, there is none. There <br>
is plenty of evidence of species lost on the other hand.&gt;<br>
<p>
The "coming into existence" of a new species is a gradual thing.  Its<br>
extinction is an abrupt one.<br>
<p>
To expound.  Suppose that an accelerated breeding process is undertaken to<br>
develope a new breed of dog.  The Doberman Pincher for example.  Over the<br>
years it  becomes somewhat distinct from it's forebears.  .... BUT in the<br>
short time that we've been paying attention to such things the difference is<br>
NOT such that a new species is differentiated.  Perhaps in another ten or<br>
twenty thousand years the Doberman Pincher (if the bloodline is kept "pure")<br>
would become a distinct species as opposed to merely a distinct "breed" as<br>
now.  <br>
<p>
I suspect that the same concept applies to all species differentiation.<br>
We've not had enough observational time to distinguish a "breed" from a<br>
"species".  So naturally we'd not notice a new arrival.  <br>
<p>
But I also suspect that there are many, many potential canidates waiting in<br>
the wings...look at all the different varieties of various domestic animals.<br>
(horses: Arabians, Clydesdales, shetlands.....cows: Holsteins, Brahma,<br>
Hereford....Goats:Nubian, Angora.....Dogs: chihuahua, Great Dane....etc. etc.<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
On second thought...perhaps we ARE seeing new species. (Consider the use of<br>
the word  "species" as used in the "Endangered Species Act"..I.e. two<br>
varieties of kangaroo mouse (or bird..or water spider)  are considered<br>
different species) Take the above mentioned examples.  Consider a Yorkshire<br>
Terrier and a St. Bernard.  Or a Boston Terrier and a Mastiff.   Now think<br>
about a German Shepard and a Timber Wolf.  The Shepard and the Wolf are<br>
considered different species are they not?  But they are observationally more<br>
similar than the dogs.  AND wolves and shepards can interbreed....whereas a<br>
Yorkie and a Great Dane cannot.(True...they could be HELPED to<br>
interbreed...testtube puppies?...but left to their own devices it can't<br>
happen....I've seen it. At one time I owned a 200 lb Great Dane Female and a<br>
11 lb Boston Terrier Male.....A VERY frusturated Boston Terrier)<br>
<p>
Perhaps we're seeing new species and just not calling them that.<br>
