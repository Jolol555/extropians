I believe the view of compensation as recently discussed is incomplete in<br>
another way; permit me to include both figure *and* ground:<br>
<p>
Because my productivity is likely to plateau (or worse!) after 40 hours<br>
*AND* because my time is all I have, it is a good use of prices as signals<br>
for me as an individual to set my over-40-hrs rate higher. Either in<br>
dollars, or in other compensation.<br>
<p>
This doesn't mean that the Gummit should step in, but collective bargaining<br>
is not against free market principles. If the competent labor pool is in<br>
short supply, the purchasers of my services will have to meet my terms or<br>
do without me. Couldn't be fairer.<br>
