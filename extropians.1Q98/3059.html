<i>&gt; From:          Jeff Fabijanic &lt;jeff@primordialsoft.com&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; So if one company has more money than the others, it should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; allowed to charge less than cost for it's product?</i><br>
<p>
Jeff, if somebody gives you a gift, do you return it and scold them <br>
for this horribly immoral and anti-competitive act?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Doesn't this</i><br>
<i>&gt; leads to a situation where, in order to compete in the short run,</i><br>
<i>&gt; other companies are forced to do the same or lose customers?</i><br>
<p>
If my competitor is selling at a loss, I need to maintain enough of a <br>
presence in the market that people don't forget about me; and I need <br>
to keep up my *capacity* for production.  But it's an excellent time <br>
to improve my *quality* and my *cost effectiveness*, because if some <br>
of that capacity is temporarily shut down for renovation it's no big <br>
problem: I *expect* my sales to temporarily drop.<br>
<p>
When my now-weaker competitor ceases to sell at a loss, I will be <br>
able to sell superior product (as compared to my own previous <br>
product) at a lower price (as compared to my own previous price), <br>
while keeping a larger profit margin.  This puts me in an excellent <br>
position to not only regain my former market share, but to take away <br>
market share from the company that voluntarily weakened itself.<br>
<p>
The only question is: do I have the reserves to survive the slow <br>
period -- or, failing that, can I convince bankers and venture <br>
capitalists to provide those reserves?  Most likely this will be a <br>
*lot* easier if I can convince them that my competitor is indeed <br>
selling at a loss.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Wouldn't that just mean that the company with the most money to burn</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the start of this cycle will probably last longest? And after the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other competitors starve, the consumers are left with fewer choices</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the long run.</i><br>
<p>
The long run is precisely why this sort of predatory pricing doesn't <br>
work.<br>
<p>
Suppose that a company manages, by selling at a loss, to become a <br>
monopoly (it has never happened, but let's suppose).  This is only <br>
beneficial if it can make up that loss through later extraordinary <br>
profits -- which creates a prime opportunity for some upstart to <br>
invade that market, breaking the monopoly.  And the "upstart" need <br>
only be an upstart in that particular industry -- it could be a truly <br>
huge pre-existing company in some other industry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And that sucks - monocultures are prone to atrophy</i><br>
<i>&gt; and catastrophic failure.</i><br>
<p>
Fortunately, they don't survive without government intervention to <br>
prevent capitalism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Most "Americans" get all bent out of shape when businesses of</i><br>
<i>&gt; another state (like Japan) try this trick on "us". Why should we</i><br>
<i>&gt; allow it within our own market system?</i><br>
<p>
The better question is, why should we get all bent out of shape when <br>
another country does it?<br>
<p>
Let's take a look at what Japan actually managed to do to the US, and <br>
for itself, by one of these alleged tricks.<br>
<p>
Reportedly, Japan was selling RAM at a loss, government subsidized, <br>
in order to take over the semiconductor business.  And you read <br>
reports that Japan managed to force all US companies out of the <br>
commodity RAM business.<br>
<p>
The truth is that Japan has yet to surpass the United States in terms <br>
of total RAM capacity produced.  IBM's US production for its own use <br>
has always been more by itself than any two Japanese manufacturers' <br>
total output.<br>
<p>
What Japan forced a bunch of US companies to do, was to stop <br>
producing RAM for the wholesale market.  But those companies did not <br>
shut down their production facilities -- they diverted the facilities <br>
to more valuable processes, increasing their profitability.<br>
<p>
Japan lost a bunch of money in this effort, and then discovered a <br>
few problems with their plan: (1) knowing how to make RAM chips with <br>
the old technology didn't help much on creating or using new <br>
technology; (2) the US companies hadn't been making much money on RAM <br>
chips anyway; (3) Korea and other countries with low labor costs <br>
(which Japan doesn't have any more) could make a *profit* selling RAM <br>
at the same price Japan was selling it at; (4) the core of the <br>
industry is the brains of chip design, not the fab plants; (5) new <br>
technology let US companies profitably re-enter the wholesale RAM <br>
business at Japan's sell-at-a-loss prices.<br>
<p>
Remember that when Japan started this effort, RAM was selling at <br>
hundreds of dollars per megabyte, wholesale.  Today it sells at <br>
dollars per megabyte, retail.  <br>
<p>
The damage done by Japan's exploitation of its monopoly is less than <br>
obvious...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not for excessive gubbamint regulation, but likewise, I wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; be in favor of any completely unregulated market scheme which didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; serve the ultimate interests of *individual humans* (ie consumers</i><br>
<i>&gt; and business people, not just the few richest businesses). I believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the goal of any market system should be to get the maximum</i><br>
<i>&gt; sustainable level of individual economic freedom and power for</i><br>
<i>&gt; *humans*, not corporations.</i><br>
<p>
Hm... start by eliminating the government interference in the free <br>
market that makes "corporations" possible...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd love to have you describe a method for avoiding this type of</i><br>
<i>&gt; positive feedback trap without any type of regulatory intervention,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and change my mind.</i><br>
<p>
