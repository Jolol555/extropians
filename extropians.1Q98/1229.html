Don't think of it as a cow, think of it as a "mobile cereal<br>
compression/archive device." (one that happens to be mighty tasty if<br>
you marinate it just right and then toss it onto the bbq :)  The food<br>
problem you allude to is not one of production but of distribution.<br>
It costs too much to move the grain to where it is needed.  We are<br>
much better at growing food than we are at processing and<br>
distributing it; we are so good at it that we have to pay people not<br>
to grow food to prevent over-production.  All of those resources go<br>
into producing meat because the animal converts the grain into a much<br>
denser package which is easier to transport.  The conversion is not<br>
even close to 100% efficient, but it is cheaper than piling the grain<br>
up at the elevator and then watching it rot.<br>
<p>
The whole "diet for a small planet" mantra reminds me of Karl Marx<br>
spending time in England and coming to the conclusion that production<br>
was everything because the transportation and distribution system was<br>
so well-developed (comparatively) that he didn't even notice it.  If<br>
you examine the food production system closely you will see that we<br>
have actually become damn good at it; at the beginning of this<br>
century the overwhelming majority of Americans worked on a farm or at<br>
a farm-related job, now fewer than one in a hundred have a job in<br>
agriculture and we still produce too much food.<br>
<p>
The urban greenhouse idea is nice, but it will require a major<br>
breakthrough to beat the efficiency of the current system.  You are<br>
adding all sorts of complexity to cut out a single step, namely the<br>
long-haul transportation.  Even if you can make the engineering work<br>
there is nothing to prevent the farmer from using the same methods to<br>
increase the efficiency of her farm and she will always have you beat<br>
on the energy costs (unless the government figures out how to<br>
regulate sunlight :)<br>

p.s. skip the veggie flames please.  I eat very little meat and have<br>
almost completely given it up for health reasons, but spent most of<br>
my childhood on a farm I know that the only reason cattle, sheep, and<br>
most livestock exist in the world today are because we keep them<br>
alive.  If it were not to become burgers and steaks then cows would<br>
have long since become another evolutionary dead-end (you cannot<br>
quite appreciate just how dumb these animals have been bred until you<br>
watch sheep trying to get out of the rain by hiding under the other<br>
sheep.)<br>
