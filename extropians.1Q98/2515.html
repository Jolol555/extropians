IMHO there is one fault in this extrapolation (I hope).<br>
Governements, at least democratic ones, are not<br>
autonomous-entities-that-have-no<br>
relation-with-the-populace-other-as-a-resource. They are representing their<br>
electorate in creation and excuting of policies. If their policies are<br>
undesirable for the populace these will get themselves a new set of<br>
representatives (I think this is how it works).<br>
<p>
Besides that there are certain safeguards like a constitition (most western<br>
countries have one) that guarantees certain basic rights (such as not to be<br>
killed and such). As long as a democratic, consitution abiding governement<br>
is in place and there is a general consesnsus that people should not be<br>
left to rot on the streets (even if they are ecnomically marginalised) I<br>
believe we'll be OK more or less.<br>
<p>
The proces of marginalization is already going of course, in the future<br>
more and more work will be done by machines, economic growth does not help<br>
here because the new products and services will also be created in an<br>
automated fashion. I know of no democratic country where unemployed people<br>
are killed or something, it seems to be working out ok so far. IMHO it is a<br>
question of reallocation of a growing amount of resources in a manner that<br>
ensures a minimum existance for every one (I realize that resource<br>
re-allocation is not a popular subject here). If anyone has better<br>
solutions, or finds faults in my reasoning....<br>
