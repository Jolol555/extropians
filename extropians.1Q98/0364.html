Hey David &lt;davidmusick@juno.com&gt;,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I was raised LDS, but have great difficulty believing many of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; religion's claims without sufficient evidence.  However, being a</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural extropian, I was most affected by the extropian aspects of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the religion.</i><br>
<p>
	This sounds exactly like me!  If It's not to prying, I'd like<br>
to know who you are?  Where you live?  Are you "active"?...  I wish<br>
there were more LDS extropians. I'm happy to know you.  We should<br>
probably take this off line since all extropians aren't necessarily<br>
interested in LDS stuff the way you and I probably are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Brent Allsop has obviously not delved very deeply into the Mormon</i><br>
<i>&gt; religion, or he would realize that its most basic doctrines are as</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropian as you can get.</i><br>
<p>
	It bothers me to hear you say this because, having been an<br>
active, seriously investigating, LDS member my entire life (so far at<br>
least).  You must have an absurdly stringent definition of what you<br>
mean by having "delved very deeply".  I think it is simply more that<br>
Mormonism is a lot of different things to a lot of different people.<br>
For example, you said that according to Mormonism:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The whole point of our existence is to learn, forever; to keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; advancing and maturing and becoming more intelligent and powerful.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This experience on Earth is only one of countless learning</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiences we've had.  And we will continue having more advanced</i><br>
<i>&gt; learning experiences, forever.</i><br>
<p>
	But Bruce R. McConkie's response to such would be:<br>
<p>
<i>] 	Heresy one: There are those who say that God is progressing in</i><br>
<i>] knowledge and is learning new truths.</i><br>
<i>] 	This is false--utterly, totally, and completely.  There is not</i><br>
<i>] one sliver of truth in it.  It grows out of a wholly twisted and</i><br>
<i>] incorrect view of the King Follet Sermon and of what is meant by</i><br>
<i>] eternal progression....</i><br>
<p>
	Which is a quote from his (in?)famous 1980 "Seven Deadly<br>
Heresies" talk at BYU.  Now, I know everything BRM says isn't<br>
necessarily true LDS doctrine, but he was one of the 12 and there are<br>
many LDS that think very much like him right?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The central core of Mormonism and Extropianism is the same --</i><br>
<i>&gt; Progress is the highest priority. Joseph Smith (the founder of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mormonism) wrote, "The glory of God is intelligence."  Sounds pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropian to me.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes exactly!  I, too, get very excited about all the extropian<br>
concepts in Mormonism.  I also think it is possible to, if interpreted<br>
very very losely and liberally, to believe that Mormonism can be taken<br>
as the same as extropianism.  Just like BRM has a different view of<br>
Mormonism than others, I always ask if we can interpret Mormonism to<br>
be Extropianism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The central core of Mormonism and Extropianism is the same --</i><br>
<i>&gt; Progress is the highest priority.</i><br>
<p>
	To me it's a bit different.  I would say, "achieving the best<br>
possible" is the central core.  The growth curve could turn out to be<br>
asymptotic, meaning we do indeed become omni-everything, before some<br>
given time; which would render more growth after crossing this<br>
asymptote in time meaningless.  I don't know if such would be better<br>
than "eternal progress", but I like to leave open such possibilities<br>
when expressing my "core" beliefs.  In fact, I like Tipplers idea of<br>
the "Omega Point" were we finally reach this omni-everything asymptote<br>
within some finite "real time", yet we are progressing eternally<br>
according to an accelerating "experiential time".  You get to have<br>
your cake and eat it too in that plan! ;)<br>
<p>
	One of the main problems I have with fundamental LDS beliefs,<br>
and other fundamentalist beliefs, is the way they seek to justify and<br>
accept evil wrather than hopping, and more importantly striving as if,<br>
it can be overcome.  Many LDS think that universal salvation is<br>
hopeless and they believe things like souls must experience death in<br>
order to become God and so on.  From this most LDS are anti cryonic<br>
and anti search for a cure for aging and so on.  It is simply such<br>
beliefs as these that I am working against. And many LDS seem to, as<br>
you say, focus on these kinds of things, wrather than the more<br>
extropian beliefs.  So much so that it seems impossible to me to<br>
really unite Extropianism with Mormonism in any kind of productive<br>
way.<br>
<p>
	Anyway, thanks for your reply, and I'm glad to know that I'm<br>
not the only Extropian LDS.<br>
