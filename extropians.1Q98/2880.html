Islands in the Clickstream:<br>
			Sneaking up on Ourselves<br>
<p>
It's pretty tricky, sneaking around a corner which is really the surface of<br>
a sphere until we are looking at the backs of our eyeballs with our own<br>
eyes. That's what happens, though, when we see ourselves seeing ourselves.<br>
<p>
That's a metaphor, of course, and metaphors are horses we can ride only to<br>
the limits of our thinking. Then they dissolve into thin air, and we ride<br>
on horseless like cartoon characters soaring off cliffs. <br>
 <br>
That may sound philosophical or even religious, but we really have to think<br>
like this at the dawn of genetic engineering. The practical applications<br>
are immense. We are beginning to engineer our very selves, to see our<br>
subjective ways of framing reality and being in the world as modular<br>
objects to be manufactured and enhanced.  In the next century, it's going<br>
to be bootstrapping big time for the human species as we see ourselves as<br>
an image in our own collective mind, an image to be designed and executed.<br>
Not exactly a computer program, but something very like.<br>
<p>
Subjectivity is hardwired into our brains. That's a way of saying that<br>
reality is an illusion, that even thinking we can slip outside the<br>
limitations of our minds - an experience that Zen adepts call enlightenment<br>
- and see what we are and what we are not, that is, see ourselves from a<br>
point of view outside ourselves - maybe that's an illusion, too.<br>
<p>
But think about this. A patient with a brain disorder was being probed with<br>
electric needles. Doctors were hoping to locate areas of the brain that<br>
were the source of her seizures. When the tip of the needle touched a<br>
particular area, the patient began laughing, laughing not at the needle or<br>
in response to it, but laughing enthusiastically and spontaneously because<br>
... well, because they were all so funny.<br>
<p>
Funny?  asked the doctor. What's funny?<br>
<p>
Well, she laughed, looking at them with sparkling eyes … the way you're all<br>
just ... standing around ... is ... so funny!<br>
<p>
I remembered a friend experimenting with hallucinogens. The drug induced a<br>
chemical change that enabled him to see clearly that everything in the<br>
world was ... show business! He couldn't stop laughing at the spectacle of<br>
role-playing human beings acting as if their social masks were real.<br>
Whatever anybody said, he cried out, "That's show business!" and dissolved<br>
into laughter once again.<br>
<p>
Another time he saw the earth as a marble, like the photograph of our<br>
planet from the moon or the world seen as a walnut in the hand of her Lord<br>
by Julian of Norwich in her anchorite's cell.  He saw the earth as a sphere<br>
from the center of which a million lines radiated to the surface, at the<br>
end of which walked tiny ant-like humans crying, "Mine! It's mine!"  Again,<br>
he laughed hysterically. And who can blame him? Humans, part of creation,<br>
acting as if they owned abstractions like "land" ... acting as if their<br>
consensual hallucinations were reality instead of a game they agreed to play.<br>
<p>
Stephen Hawking gave a lecture last week at the White House. Through the<br>
"wonders of modern technology," a RealAudio/Video feed played on my desktop<br>
as I worked late into the night. His electronic voice said that, unlike<br>
Star Trek or Star Wars, in which contemporary humans are projected pretty<br>
much as we are into the distant future, he believed we would recreate<br>
ourselves through genetic engineering in ways we can not even imagine.<br>
People think of obvious things - greater strength, longer lives, faster<br>
reactions - extensions of how we are today that make us more and better,<br>
but not significantly different.  The real differences will be created and<br>
discovered as we learn how laughter and sadness happen, how we construct<br>
reality, how we use mood-altering experiences like religion, therapy,<br>
entertainment, other kinds of cultural play, how we mean and be. <br>
<p>
Some religious sentiments - like wonder and awe - have been linked to<br>
particular genes, just as parts of the brain, altered by the use of<br>
spiritual tools, ingestion of chemicals, or electric probes, spontaneously<br>
generate visions that are ... so funny! Visions of human beings acting as<br>
if we are gods on a planet from the oceans and mud of which we have only<br>
recently crawled.  This civilization is a phase, not a conclusion, and this<br>
earth is just one of the millions of planets teeming with life that will<br>
teach us how we have evolved and maybe even why.<br>
<p>
Zen masters disdain the use of chemicals or electricity to induce<br>
enlightenment. They prefer traditions handed down for generations.  That<br>
perspective may soon seem quaint and archaic. Genetic engineering will<br>
enable us to say at a particular level of description - a level appropriate<br>
to biochemistry and biomechanics - what happens when we experience that<br>
which emerges in our subjectivity as awesome, wonderful, or funny. We will<br>
create emotional states of being that do not yet have names. The beings<br>
that feel, think, experience those states - our intentional progeny - will<br>
embody that unimaginable next step for the species of which Hawking was<br>
speaking.<br>
<p>
Ethical reflection never anticipates the breakthroughs that make us sit up<br>
straight, nor do legal niceties. What will we do when our mistakes exhibit<br>
behaviors we don't want? Put them in reservations or safari parks, use<br>
insect-like cameras to scuttle among them, amusing ourselves with their<br>
wacky antics? <br>
<p>
Will they vote? Will anyone? And will it matter?<br>
<p>
Self-transcendence is an emergent behavior, perhaps the beginning of a<br>
rising spiral of possibilities: The ability to see ourselves from a<br>
meta-perspective, sneaking up behind ourselves and watching ourselves think<br>
thoughts like these. The ability to experience the disappearance of what we<br>
call our "minds" as we realize that "no-mind" simply describes what's so.<br>
The ability to decide what's funny or whether to include humor at all in<br>
our genetic program ... some of our progeny roaring with laughter at the<br>
mere thought while others stare uncomprehendingly, wondering what's so<br>
blanking funny. <br>
