This is a slightly dated story (3 months old) but its interesting and a bit<br>
amusing.  In a contest of sorts, two competitors, one a human music professor<br>
and the other a computer program, were asked to write Bach-like musical<br>
pieces.  An audience then heard three pieces: one composed by the human<br>
professor, one composed by the computer program, and one composed by Bach<br>
himself.  The audience concluded that the piece actually written by the human<br>
professor was written by the computer program, the piece actually written by<br>
the computer program was written by Bach, and that the Bach piece was written<br>
by the computer program.  An interesting state of affairs... (pardon the size<br>
of the article)<br>

In a low-key, musical version of the match between Garry Kasparov and<br>
the<br>
chess-playing machine called Deep Blue, a musician at the University of<br>
Oregon competed last month with a computer to compose music in the style<br>
of Johann Sebastian Bach. Dr. Steven Larson, who teaches music theory at<br>
the university, listened anxiously while his wife, the pianist Winifred<br>
Kerner, performed three entries in the contest -- one by Bach, one by<br>
Larson and one by a computer program called EMI, or Experiments in<br>
Musical<br>
Intelligence.<br>
<p>
Larson was disappointed when the audience concluded that his piece - a<br>
simple, engaging form called a two-part invention - was written by the<br>
computer, but he felt somewhat mollified when the listeners decided that<br>
the invention composed by EMI (pronounced "Emmy") was genuine Bach.<br>
<p>
"Bach is absolutely one of my favourite composers," Larson said. "My<br>
admiration for his music is deep and cosmic. That people could be duped<br>
by<br>
a computer program was very disconcerting."<br>
<p>
The cybernetic pretender, which was invented by David Cope, a composer<br>
at<br>
the University of California at Santa Cruz, has been upsetting long-held<br>
assumptions by people in the music world because of its ability to scan<br>
pieces by famous composers, automatically distill some of their essence<br>
and then churn out imitations of the work.<br>
<p>
The cognitive scientist and author Dr. Douglas Hofstadter, who presided<br>
over the contest at the University of Oregon in Eugene, calls EMI "the<br>
most thought-provoking project in artificial intelligence that I have<br>
ever<br>
come across."<br>
<p>
"EMI forces us to look at great works of art and wonder where they came<br>
from," he said. "Nothing that I have seen in artificial intelligence has<br>
done this so well."<br>
<p>
The artificial composer was the focus of a recent symposium, organized<br>
by<br>
Hofstadter at Stanford University, which included two live concerts of<br>
EMI's music. In addition, a new CD of EMI's compositions, called<br>
"Classical Music Composed by Computer" is being released by Centaur<br>
Records.<br>
<p>
The collection includes not only artificial Bach inventions but also<br>
works<br>
imitating a Beethoven sonata, a Chopin mazurka, a Rachmaninoff suite,<br>
Mozart and Stravinsky and a Scott Joplin piano rag. Casual listeners<br>
could<br>
easily mistake many of the pieces for the real thing.<br>
<p>
On a more ambitious level, EMI recently composed a full-scale Mozart<br>
symphony and piano concerto, which were performed in April by the Santa<br>
Cruz Baroque Festival on period instruments.<br>
<p>
Linda Burman-Hall, who played the piano solo for the concerto, said, "It<br>
felt a little different than playing a normal Mozart work, but it was<br>
very<br>
much like a work of the same period. It was certainly in the ball park."<br>
<p>
All of this is rather disconcerting to music lovers who believe that the<br>
unique style of a composer springs from a deep well of emotion and<br>
experience, that the creator of a composition is speaking musically in a<br>
very special way.<br>
<p>
EMI is not trying to say anything. It has no passions, no memories and<br>
knows nothing about life. Its entire inner world consists of rules for<br>
how<br>
to sift through past compositions for characteristic patterns of<br>
melodies,<br>
harmonies and rhythms, and then to recombine them into plausible ( and<br>
sometimes beautiful ) music.<br>
<p>
The implication, which many composers and musicians emphatically reject,<br>
is that musical style might just consist of a collection of simple<br>
recipes, that the feelings and intent of the composer may not be so<br>
important after all.<br>
<p>
In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book "Godel, Escher, Bach," published in<br>
1979, Hofstadter speculated on whether uplifting music would ever be<br>
composed by an artificially intelligent machine.<br>
<p>
A program that could produce music as mesmerizing as the great masters',<br>
he concluded, would require more than simple routines for stringing<br>
together notes. The machine would have to learn what it feels like to be<br>
alive. It "would have to wander around the world on its own," he wrote,<br>
"fighting its way through the maze of life and feeling every moment of<br>
it.<br>
It would have to understand the joy and loneliness of a chilly night<br>
wind,<br>
the longing for a cherished hand."<br>
<p>
Now he is not quite so sure. "I find myself baffled and troubled by<br>
EMI,"<br>
he said. "The only comfort I could take at this point comes from<br>
realizing<br>
that EMI does not generate style on its own. It depends on mimicking<br>
prior<br>
composers, but that is still not all that much comfort. To what extent<br>
is<br>
music composed of `riffs', as jazz people say? If that is mostly the<br>
case,<br>
then it would mean that, to my absolute devastation, music is much less<br>
than previously thought."<br>
<p>
Not all of EMI's illusions are equally beguiling. The longer the program<br>
tries to sustain its masquerade, the more likely it is to stumble. "If I<br>
turn on three seconds of EMI and ask myself, 'What was that?' I would<br>
say<br>
Bach," Hofstadter said, "but if I leave it on for twenty or thirty<br>
seconds, it does not make sense. It is like listening to random lines<br>
from<br>
a Keats sonnet. You wonder what was happening to Keats that day. Was he<br>
completely drunk?"<br>
<p>
Burman-Hall said that EMI did its best renditions of composers like Bach<br>
or Mozart, whose style is "more Apollinian, restrained, logical and<br>
equation-like."<br>
<p>
The program is not so successful, she said, with less predictable<br>
composers like Beethoven or Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. "When<br>
I<br>
play C.P. Bach," she said, "I hear him having second thoughts, wandering<br>
off and then feeling remorse and coming back to what he said before."<br>
For<br>
now, anyway, some of these more subtle motifs seem to elude EMI's<br>
pattern-<br>
recognition routines.<br>
<p>
Cope concedes that real Bach, younger or older, is still better than his<br>
program's pseudo-Bach. "EMI produces beautiful music but maybe not<br>
profound music," he said, but then how many people, he asks, can come as<br>
close as EMI does to mimicking the greatest composers of all time?<br>
<p>
As he continues to refine the program, he expects the imitations to<br>
improve, incorporating more and more of the trademarks that make up a<br>
composer's musical personality.<br>
<p>
As a test of EMI's abilities, Cope likes to play its compositions to<br>
people who do not know that they are hearing music that was written by a<br>
computer. "When they assume that the music is human, they are obviously<br>
moved and speak in the same terms as if it had been composed by Chopin,"<br>
he said. They describe the emotions unleashed by the music and speculate<br>
on what the composer was trying to say.<br>
<p>
"When I tell them that there is nothing behind the music but cold hard<br>
machinery doing addition and subtraction," Cope continued, "then they<br>
will<br>
not admit that they were moved." These experiments have led Cope to<br>
believe that the meaning of a piece of music lies largely in the ear of<br>
the beholder.<br>
