<p>
So I can presume from this message that there is no evidence to<br>
support your claims.  So granted it has no scientific basis we need to<br>
find a rational way of looking at the current situation.  Let's have a<br>
look at current theory:<br>
<p>
Their exists an age above which a child matures to a point where he or<br>
she is 'emotionally ready' to have a sexual relationship.  How this<br>
age is determined I am unsure, and you (despite repeated requests)<br>
have yet to explain this.  But in order for there to be a way of<br>
proving such an age exists, we need to prove the following points:<br>
<p>
Children mature at the same rate - However, I'll let this one slide<br>
since having a "round about" age of consent is purely for reasons of<br>
ease of enforcement.<br>
<p>
Emotional Readiness is not a product of social trends, it can be<br>
proven to exist in a society that does not believe in "emotional<br>
readiness" and it can be measured.  How?<br>
<p>
A force other than a society that believes the 'crime' to be 'wrong'<br>
creates emotional trauma.  If so would you mind telling me what this<br>
force is?<br>
<p>
If society did not believe this 'crime' to be wrong, the victim would<br>
still suffer emotional trauma because they were not emotionally ready.<br>
 And that emotional readiness and need for emotional readiness is not<br>
a product of social trends.<br>
<p>
However, there exists no evidence to prove the existence of a specific<br>
age at which a person is emotionally ready.  There exists no research<br>
to find the cause of the emotional trauma (a victim's emotional trauma<br>
must, for you case to be sound, be caused by the perpetrator and not<br>
the societal "shunning" which occurs after the crime.)  The current<br>
theory has (from what you have led me to believe) no grounding in<br>
science, and is purely based on opinion.<br>
<p>
Added to this, different countries/cultures have different opinions of<br>
the subject of emotional readiness.  Thus, the idea is not objective<br>
and is purely subjective.  Countries that have a lower 'age of<br>
consent' and a more open attitude to sex/sexuality generally have less<br>
problems (emotional or otherwise) regarding sexual behaviour.  And<br>
countries with no age of consent have no paedophilic crime at all!<br>
<p>
So prove these right and I'll be willing to except your "current<br>
theory" (although perhaps not as religiously as you have.)<br>
