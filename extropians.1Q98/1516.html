I think it _is_ important to increase the appeal of the transhumanist <br>
philosophy to women. We've been thinking a bit about how the WTA <br>
could contribute that, so far without any very definite conclusions.<br>
<p>
One good way, I think, would be to capitalize on the women we <br>
already have (sorry for this way of phrasing it...). I mean, there <br>
are female contributors to this list, for example, who could serve as <br>
superb role models -- sucessful, strong, creative, confident. It <br>
is much easier to assimilate a philosophy if there is a person you <br>
admire who embodies it. And it would show that transhumanism is not <br>
just abstract words but also something that can be _lived_.<br>
<p>
It might also be true that there are some issues which are more <br>
"male" and some that are more "female". Perhaps, on average, men are <br>
comparatively more interested in molecular nanotechnology and women <br>
in, say, new forms of interpersonal relations. If that is so, then <br>
one could try to give more coverage to these "female" topics. (Or <br>
prehaps, I am just prejudiced.)<br>

Very true, and that is often the hardest part. I was doing a debate <br>
last Sunday on cloning. Afterward, many people came up and typically <br>
they would say that they were impressed by the arguments presented by <br>
our side. "Your presentation and your arguments were much better." -- <br>
Did you vote for us? --"OF COURSE not!".<br>

<p>
Thanks. I'm just a part of it, though. The initial response has been <br>
extremely encouraging :-)<br>
<p>
Let me also say, just to forestall any possible misunderstanding, <br>
that though the WTA is a separate entity from the Extropy Institute, <br>
it is not a rival or even competitor, but rather a symbiont and ally. <br>
The goal is to increase the outreach to include extropians and also <br>
those transhumanists who do not accept all features of extropian <br>
transhumanism. One important goal is to bring transhumanism to <br>
academic respectability<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I would like to contribute on, is the translation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; all these idea's, opinions and research to the majority.</i><br>
<p>
...which is another main goal, perhaps the most important one.<br>
