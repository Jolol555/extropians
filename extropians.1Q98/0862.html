I think we should just keep a) expanding the movement (get more<br>
people onboard the transhuman express:) and b) doing the hard<br>
work of advancing the ideas -- in terms of planning or developing<br>
them.  For the latter, one thing we can do which is low cost and<br>
not as hard to do, is try to find porfitable uses for any new<br>
technology that arises.<br>
<p>
Thus, when arguing for cloning, we should not confine ourselves<br>
to saying there's nothing morally repugnant with it or pointing to<br>
flaws in the logic of the horror stories, but also point out the<br>
benefits and opportunities.<br>
<p>
To digress, an interesting recent argument against cloning I ran<br>
into was that clones would be treated differently.  Perhaps they<br>
will, but my counter was that so are lots of different kinds of<br>
people.  Pick a minority in a given area, such as, in most of<br>
America, Blacks, short people, gays, and atheists.  Surely,<br>
these people are treated differently and often for the wrong<br>
reasons, BUT would one argue that they should be carted<br>
off and not allowed to mix because of this?  At the same time,<br>
the solution to such prejudice might be just to make more<br>
clones.  The mainstream will then come to see it as different<br>
but tolerable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Good to have a distribution network already in place, no?</i><br>
<p>
I agree, though we should evaluate the efficiency of various<br>
networks -- real or imagined.  We already have the internet,<br>
and it seems to be good at allowing us to chat, find information<br>
and spread the latest news.<br>
<p>
And some of the hacker community is no doubt in our ranks<br>
already.:)<br>
