<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; All of the above is very useful, but not a substitute for an autonomous</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; extropian nation. You might be relatively "free" while surfing the net,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is more-or-less, and also a lot easier to implement. It can also be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; testbed for nonvirtual Extropia (which, for the record, I must consider a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; yet another (and powerfully distracting at that) dream).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Distracting from what, exactly? Everyday life?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Me, I'd just be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; deliriously happy to survive the Singularity (i.e. having a continous</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; trajectory in persona space thru the Singularity).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless transhumanists get somehow organized the chances that any of</i><br>
<i>&gt; us will make it past singularity are close to zero; the powers that be will</i><br>
<i>&gt; crush us all like worms. Only (some of) the rich and powerful are going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make it.</i><br>
<p>
I propose that two foci for extropian communities, which already seem to be in the<br>
embryonic states: the California Enclave, focused on technology, and the Washington DC<br>
Focus, emphasizing the cultural and political, be recognised as necessary for further<br>
development of extropian goals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Btw, is the current ad</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hoc Californian Extropians enclave not sufficient/is a natural segregation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; focus? (Anybody in residence over there care to relate your experiences?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm sure the Exclave is a lot of fun, but hardly comparable to a sovereign</i><br>
<i>&gt; country...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; but you still live in the real world where you're pretty much at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; mercy of the often whimsical government and "society". Furthermore,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think the idealist escapist in you makes you gloss over the rough edges</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; far too easily.</i><br>
<i>&gt; No-one said it's *easy*, but it doesn't take a superhuman effort either. Others</i><br>
<i>&gt; have done it, so why can't we?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Unless a full-blown neoludd witchhunt is on (then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; presenting an easy target is definitely not a good idea),</i><br>
<i>&gt; The neoluddites are an insignificant bunch of morons, and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; the real problem. Organized crime and governments on the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; hand...</i><br>
<p>
Don't underestimate the threat. Its a statistical fact that the highest viewership of<br>
television evangelists is Washingotn DC. Who has the pulse of the powerful???<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the interference</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of state can only be considered a minor (albeit definitely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; resource-draining) nuisance. Yeah, it's not pretty, but it won't hinder</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; your plans enough to prevent the altogether. If yes, your plans may not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have been that robust after all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A lot of small nuisances still can make life miserable. Instead of enduring</i><br>
<i>&gt; decades of paying taxes, filling out forms for every stupid thing, waiting periods,</i><br>
<i>&gt; legal injustice, petty crime and all the other crap that's related to our societies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can focus on one major effort, and reap the fruits for many years to come.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A private nation is an investment that can ultimately save you a lot of money</i><br>
<i>&gt; and frustration. It's the embodyment of personal freedom and responsibility.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course things can go wrong, but then again you can also lose your job</i><br>
<i>&gt; and be unable to get another one, for example. Life is a risk, no matter what</i><br>
<i>&gt; you do.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; virtual networking is nice to chat and make initial contacts, but if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; *really* want to get something done you'll still need get togeter</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Does distributed project coordination, a focused newsfeed (time is money!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and digicash transfer strike a vein? The importance of _direct_ matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; manipulation may be further diminished if we consider minimal telepresence</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; capability expected to become available in the next two decades, or so. In</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; any case you could purchase the services desired, albeit efficiency might</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; suffer. Of course this is a just another sterile Geekonia dream. So sue</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Aren't all kinds of virtual activities best conducted from a safe haven with your</i><br>
<i>&gt; own sandy beach and waving palms? ;) For some very lucrative business like</i><br>
<i>&gt; new designer drugs (the "grey area" kind that's not yet universally recognized</i><br>
<i>&gt; as illegal) and virtual porn (apart from kids just about anything goes) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; world lotteries and other gambling activities (virtual or otherwise) a distant</i><br>
<i>&gt; retreat is highly recommended. Money &amp; fun in the sun, what else could</i><br>
<i>&gt; you want?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; IRL. Besides, a new nation is *adventure*, an energizing inspiration to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; all, a great service (refuge from persecution) and a potential source</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Also, it is a great resource sink, and just an invitation to having you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; all conveniently extinguished (yes, chronic paranoia _can_ become a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lifestyle).</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think you're a lot safer on your private island than in a big city, for example,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and *should* someone try to bother you (which is unlikely if you keep a</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonably low profile) you have at least the means to defend yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt; (your budget is the only limit).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Btw, anybody having a wager when we will see the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (sub)tactical nuke use, and by whom? Similiar bets as to bioweapons'?.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think Israel's gonna see some action within the next five years or so.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The former USSR is also a likely candidate, of course, and it wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; surprise me if some US city got a taste of home-brewn chem/bio before</i><br>
<i>&gt; the end of the century. All very predictable...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; of considerable income (something this movement is in dire need of).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Judging from the cryonics movement (at least two instances?) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Scientology dogma can be a great motivation for individual finance</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; resource accretion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, we need more dogma! Dogma inspires people, vague ideas don't...</i><br>
<i>&gt; (only half-joking).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Being a personal success beakon will make extropy look</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; like more than a yet another weird Californian cult. Imho. (And having ExI</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not permanently teetering at the edge of bankruptcy (feel free to correct</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; me) should also help to increase the memefection rate somewhat).</i><br>
<i>&gt; What's the alternative plan, then?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Founding a new nation gives a sense of direction to transhumanism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; and it's an useful drill for the next logical step: migration to space.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; By the time we are supposed to get hit by that fabled Singularity I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; expect only a few 10 k persons in (mostly, cislunar) space, if at all. A</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; malignant Singularity will thus have an easy time to having your systems</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; perverted, when looking for minimax paths into space. Autistic fugitives</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; at the periphery ought to have a fairly good chance, though. Call me</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Ishmael</i><br>
<i>&gt; How do autistic fugitives get access to the first body enhancers/upload devices?</i><br>
<i>&gt; They don't (unless they somehow build such a machine by themselves, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; is unlikely at best). Athough money will lose it's value in the singularity, it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be crucial to have plenty of it to get a good starting point. Whoever gets hyper-</i><br>
<i>&gt; enhanced first, wins. The rest might very well die, because the greatest</i><br>
<i>&gt; threat to a superpower is another superpower, and since all humans are potential</i><br>
<i>&gt; superminds they will need to be neutralized (and killing is probably the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficient way). Not pretty, but nontheless a reasonably likely scenario for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "singularity" if rich criminals and governments get this technology first.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Isolated cybergeeks don't stand a chance against these forces, but an</i><br>
<i>&gt; organization might pull it of (construct an "uploader" before anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; else does).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; This should be possible if all pioneer groups interested in this combine</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; their forces. Differences can always be settled once we're offplanet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Oh yes, and my augmented hamster is building a wormhole drive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I wish him the best of luck!</i><br>
