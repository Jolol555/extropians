Yes, I was reflecting on that when I wrote my posting. The Tithonus<br>
story, for example, shows that just immortality isn't what we want, we<br>
want eternal youth (plus it contains a clear example of why one should<br>
think through one's wishes carefully before implementing them).<br>
<p>
Many of the other anti-hubris stories aren't really about the futility<br>
of hubris, but rather of the form "look out for the Powers That Be,<br>
they don't like competition", i.e. hubris works perfectly well, but be<br>
prepared that some people will try to stop you. Prometheus, for<br>
example, clearly knew that the gods would punish him for his deed but<br>
accepted that and still went along with his plan (besides, to an<br>
immortal titan a few millennia of agony before a remote relative<br>
(Hercules) frees him might be a rather small piece to pay for giving<br>
fire to the humans). Gilgamesh lost his immortality because he didn't<br>
guard it well, Phaeton didn't see the limits of his competence and<br>
Arachne foolishly challenged a sore loser who she knew was<br>
significantly more powerful than herself.<br>
