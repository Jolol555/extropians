These types of comments have been bounced around on this list for a while<br>
and I have a few comments that I think are very relevant to the issues here.<br>
<p>
This community *is* large enough to effect significant change in the world<br>
of technology.  The big problem is that everyone on this list seems to want<br>
to make huge leaps in technology, rather than following a more incremental<br>
path.  While huge leaps are great, it is highly unlikely and financially<br>
unsound as an investment.  <br>
<p>
There are numerous, profitable markets between here and singularity.  Don't<br>
invest in nanotech, invest in a company that creates protein modeling<br>
software.  It is unlikely that we will invent nanotech before we can<br>
properly model complex organics.  As much as we would like to ignore it,<br>
there is a great deal of continuity in technological progress.  If you want<br>
to accelerate the outcome, work on fixing the more short-term technology<br>
problems and make a little money while you are at it.  Not only is it<br>
generally more profitable, but a lot more people will be willing to invest<br>
in your ideas.<br>
