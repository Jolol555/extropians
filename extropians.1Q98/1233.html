1. Design and construction of an assembler. There will<br>
soon be a web page where you can go and describe a nanosystem <br>
by shape and substance, and a Java applet will generate an <br>
atomic blueprint to those specifications. I base this <br>
prediction on discussions at nanocad@world.std.com. <br>
The core of the applet will be based on <br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.std.com/pub/wware/alg_gen.tgz">ftp://ftp.std.com/pub/wware/alg_gen.tgz</a>.<br>
<p>
Similar programs could be used to generate complete<br>
nonsense (from a chemical POV), but as time passes more<br>
and more chemical knowledge will be encoded in them,<br>
and the designs will become more robust. So we will<br>
shortly have a flood of DIY nanomachine designs. Maybe<br>
it'll be a standard feature on some homepages - "Here<br>
is my CV, here is my cat, here are my nanodesigns."<br>
<p>
The question then becomes, how do you actually build an <br>
assembler? The most promising path I've thought of would <br>
involve what I call a "buckybot", a nanobot built of <br>
fullerenes. This appears promising because we already <br>
have fullerenes, and the guru, Richard Smalley, expects <br>
nanotubes "to become available by the megaton, and to become <br>
available with precisely controlled terminating groups." <br>
(<a href="http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Update31/Update31.1.html">http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Update31/Update31.1.html</a>)<br>
<p>
Perhaps fullerenes with appropriate terminating groups can <br>
implement the Merkle toolset for mechanosynthesis of diamond <br>
(<a href="http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/hydroCarbonMetabolism.html">http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/hydroCarbonMetabolism.html</a>);<br>
then "all" we need is a way to position and move the tools<br>
with nanometer precision. (We don't initially need an onboard <br>
nanocomputer; that's only for *programmable* assemblers, as<br>
opposed to directly-controlled.)<br>
<p>
2. Developing useful applications of NT. I recently made<br>
a post to sci.nanotech, "Priority uses for nanotechnology",<br>
which says what I'd say here, namely that it's time serious<br>
design work began on the "utopian" applications of NT, so<br>
that we're ready to use the technology the moment it<br>
arrives. (Yes, I know "arrival" is not a literally instantaneous<br>
thing, but I think it will be a *very* fast climb from<br>
clunky limited assemblers to scary powerful world-class<br>
assemblers, thanks to the rapidity with which one will be<br>
able to build, test, and redesign. If nanotube mechanisms<br>
aren't the start of this process, it might come from<br>
biotech, through the use of ribosomes, as de novo protein<br>
design improves.)<br>
<p>
3. Picotechnology and spacetime engineering through the<br>
use of "Q-balls". Q-balls are (wholly hypothetical)<br>
solitons in scalar fields like the Higgs, inside of<br>
which these fields take different values from outside. <br>
To the extent that low-energy physics is governed by the <br>
values of scalar fields (and in some models all particle <br>
masses are set by the values of Higgs fields), physics can <br>
be different inside a Q-ball. For example, a proton entering<br>
a Q-ball might decay more quickly. Alexander Kusenko<br>
(<a href="http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~sasha/">http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~sasha/</a>) suggests<br>
using Q-balls as an energy source: drop them in water,<br>
tap the heat generated by proton decay<br>
(<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/ns/970830/nqballs.html">http://www.newscientist.com/ns/970830/nqballs.html</a>).<br>
He also says (in his papers) that Q-balls are a feature <br>
of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which is a <br>
conservative guess at physics beyond the Standard Model. <br>
Kusenko seems to be the main theorist of Q-balls, although<br>
they are originally the invention of Sidney Coleman.<br>
<p>
An example of the advantages one might accrue by<br>
modulating the values of the physical "constants":<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9703017">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9703017</a> tells us that<br>
the probability of a wormhole tunneling into existence<br>
depends on the value of the fine-structure constant<br>
(i.e. on the coupling constant of QED).<br>
<p>
See <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9707423">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9707423</a> for a more<br>
detailed exposition. "A Q-ball is essentially a new <br>
universe in a nutshell." This is the sort of remark<br>
that set me off. Q-balls may be an enabling technology<br>
for the creation of baby universes. Alan Guth <br>
(co-discoverer of inflation) says somewhere (reference<br>
not to hand, sorry) that it would only take a few Kg<br>
of mass-energy to create a new region of inflation.<br>
Of course, it needs to be concentrated into a *very*<br>
small area, and to do that might require huge forces,<br>
but do we really need to go as far as, say, stellar<br>
collapse? Perhaps we can do it using massive Q-balls,<br>
or mini black holes created through Bose-Einstein<br>
condensation of asteroidal quantities of rubidium,<br>
or some such thing.<br>
<p>
Gregory Benford apparently has a new novel, _Cosm_,<br>
in which there's a baby universe created; it will<br>
be interesting to see what mechanism he proposes.<br>
<p>
Something else we need: a map of the thousands of<br>
superstring vacua - what sort of structures can<br>
form in each, how difficult it is to get from one<br>
such state to another. Such transitions have been<br>
modelled, to a limited extent (hep-th/9504145).<br>
<p>
Another tangent: Planck-scale computers. Perhaps<br>
one could use Bekenstein-bound-saturating states (e.g.<br>
"BPS saturated states") as info-processors with <br>
physically maximal storage density and 10^43 Hz speeds.<br>
Greg Egan's "The Planck Dive" (Feb 98, "Asimov's<br>
SF magazine", not yet seen by me) apparently describes<br>
a related scenario.<br>
<p>
4. Boundless energy and computational speedup from <br>
networks of baby universes. People have been hazily<br>
aware of these ideas for a while, but I'm not aware<br>
of any quantitative exploration, probably because there's<br>
no exact theory available.<br>
<p>
If Tipler can get a boundless energy yield from the<br>
collapsing universe in his Omega Point theory,<br>
surely we can do the same from a boundlessly<br>
growing array of baby universes. [The nature of energy <br>
in GR still puzzles me; John Baez even says (in a recent <br>
post on sci.physics.research, 21/01/98 for those who want <br>
to look it up) it's not always conserved in GR!]<br>
<p>
5. Conceptualizing and planning for "infinite futures".<br>
For example:<br>
<p>
One can imagine a very fast computer connected to<br>
sensors and effectors throughout a baby universe.<br>
The computer maintains a model of the state of the rest <br>
of the universe, constantly updated via the sensors.<br>
There is always a particular finite range of actions<br>
open to it through the effectors. What it does is to<br>
model the effects of each possible action, some degree<br>
into the future, and selects an action on the basis of<br>
some criterion ('value system'?) applied to the various<br>
projected outcomes.<br>
<p>
Is such a system feasible? Is it desirable? I find it<br>
plausible that some such system is a feature of all<br>
infinite futures worth discussing, and that the <br>
interesting questions concern implementation and the<br>
'value system' to be used.<br>
<p>
6. Physics applets. I'd like to have pages where you<br>
could go and see elementary physics in action. Imagine<br>
applets implementing different physical models, for which<br>
you could select initial conditions, and witness some of<br>
the calculations involved. One might have each of the types <br>
of approximate model listed in _Nanosystems_, Table 1.4, and <br>
each candidate for fundamental theory from Newton through to <br>
QED (QCD might be intractable for a web browser). <br>
<p>
7. World models on the web. <br>
<p>
First, I'd like to see Club-of-Rome-style world models<br>
on the web. They should be incredibly easy to do, say,<br>
in Javascript, the problem lies in finding a model to use.<br>
I suspect that the most valuable ones are either proprietary<br>
or languish in dusty academic obscurity.<br>
<p>
Then, I'd like to see models which factor in things like:<br>
space colonzation and development, the existence of matter <br>
compilers, the growth of a new "humanly incomprehensible" <br>
sector of the economy, and so on.<br>
<p>
9. Net as a single distributed computational system.<br>
<p>
I think here of projects like www.distributed.net.<br>
I hope that it will eventually become a standard thing for<br>
a networked computer to be part of a number of distributed<br>
processing systems, to which it will donate computational<br>
power when idle.<br>
<p>
I also want to see intelligent 'query engines', to which<br>
one can pose a natural-language question, which the engine<br>
would answer by consulting knowledge databases scattered<br>
across the net. This could be helped along if there was<br>
a knowledge-representation equivalent of HTML: a language<br>
for the representation of facts, in a form suitable for<br>
computer manipulation. CycL (www.cyc.com) might be a<br>
candidate, others can be seen at<br>
<a href="http://mnemosyne.itc.it:1024/ontology.html">http://mnemosyne.itc.it:1024/ontology.html</a>.<br>
<p>
The QED Project (<a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov:80/qed/">http://www.mcs.anl.gov:80/qed/</a>) is an<br>
attempt to do this sort of thing just within mathematics -<br>
it could later be the nucleus of a more general-purpose<br>
effort.<br>
<p>
10. Quantum compiler. We need a way to turn programs<br>
into something that can be run on a quantum computer.<br>
<p>
11. Brain models. Data, maps, computational models.<br>
<p>
12. What it's like to be 'auto-omniscient' (knowing<br>
everything about oneself) and 'autopotent' (having <br>
the capacity to change any aspect of oneself - term <br>
due to Nick Bostrom).<br>
