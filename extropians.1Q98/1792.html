I disagree.<br>
<p>
It is designed. I am designing my body right now. Many other people are<br>
designing theirs, including bodysculptors.<br>
<p>
Oh. I see; you mean the human body in general has no design. That means<br>
that there is no detectable difference from the human body and everything<br>
in the universe that is not the human body? No detectable structure?<br>
<p>
Oh. I see. You mean you don't believe in a Creator; therefore there can be<br>
no design in anything that occurs naturally. Hmm. Could you please point to<br>
something you can find that is unnatural?<br>
<p>
Oh. I see. You think anyone who uses the word "design" to refer to anything<br>
that did not take the conscious effort of some human is a (perhaps closet)<br>
Creationist/Deist/Teleological BAD PERSON, and NEEEDS to have the faith<br>
reinstated, or a kick in the behind.<br>
<p>
Well then, you're just plain wrong, that's all. No way I can argue with that.<br>
<p>

My view: Design can and does exist without a designer. A watchmaker being<br>
blind is still a watchmaker. The blind watchmaker is the whole universe and<br>
its laws. It designs everything. (in effect and appearance). Slooooooowly.<br>
:) Then we come along. But we are part of it, so there's no paradox, no<br>
need for your fuzzy headed Humans versus universe dualism. :) QED.<br>
