Some lawyers recently pointed out that since the death penalty was<br>
revived twenty-odd years ago Illinois has carried out 8 death sentences<br>
-- and 9 convicts on death row have been cleared by new evidence.<br>

In Virginia a few years ago, a man died (still protesting his innocence)<br>
because his lawyer was a day late filing some paper or other.<br>

Larry Niven's novel _A World Out of Time_ has a brief depiction of a<br>
zero-time prison: a big temporal stasis box that amounts to a waiting<br>
room - since time only passes while a convict is coming in (or going<br>
out, but that's obviously more rare), there's no need even for beds!<br>
