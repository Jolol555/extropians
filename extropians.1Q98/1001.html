I had a discussion with somebody about the amount of <br>
information required to store a persons state of mind.<br>
I have written down my reasoning here...<br>
<p>
By the way, Hans Moravec used this same kind of reasoning: <br>
Estimate the amount of information required to describe <br>
the brain by estimating the total amount of information <br>
entering the brain.<br>
<p>
---------------<br>
<p>
First lets assume that every arbitrary state of the <br>
human brain can be approached discretely. <br>
<p>
The beginning state of the brain (at least before birth, <br>
or better, before any actual inputs arrive) we should <br>
in principle be able to deduct from the information <br>
stored in the DNA. (The DNA contains about 10^10 bits)<br>
<p>
Lets assume that the exact behavior of the brain can be <br>
predicted. However, we do not have to understand how <br>
the total system can behave as it will behave. <br>
It is sufficient to be able to exactly predict how <br>
the seperate elements from which the brain is constituted <br>
(i.e. the neurons) will behave (when you know how they <br>
are connected).<br>
<p>
Now, every new successive state should be derivable from <br>
the original state and the inputs it receives during the <br>
interval in between. (The inputs to the brain also include <br>
those originating from the rest of the internal body.)<br>
<p>
The question now is : how much is the total information <br>
input a person receives during his life. Or, on average, <br>
how much input does a person receive during a day.<br>
<p>
Of course this input enters via the sensory organs. You <br>
could try to estimate the amount of digital information <br>
per unit of time, required to discretely describe the <br>
(ordinary average) input for ALL seperate sensory nerves.<br>
<p>
However not all information that enters the brain (or the <br>
sensory nerves) is actually being used by the brain. It <br>
filters the information and uses only parts of it. We <br>
should be able to do this filtering beforehand. For <br>
example, the brain does not remember every detail of <br>
a picture it has seen (or even one it is seeing).<br>
<p>
<p>
Lets formulate it differently:<br>
<p>
Assumed we would connect all sensory nerves to a computer. <br>
Assumed the steps of the DACs are sufficiently small to <br>
not be noticed by the brain. The question then is: <br>
how much information per unit of time do I need to <br>
simulate the real life environment of a human individual <br>
in such a way that his brain will not notice the difference. <br>
<p>
I guess that, for example, 50 gigabytes per day should <br>
be sufficient to describe (simulate) all the sensory <br>
impressions our brains receive during a day, without <br>
our brains being able to notice the diffenrence between <br>
the real impressions and the simulated ones. <br>
<p>
An information input of 50 gigabytes per day results <br>
in a total of approximately 10^16 bits after an average <br>
human life time. The 10^10 of the DNA are much less and <br>
can thus be neglected.<br>
<p>
Of course these methods only indicate what could be <br>
achieved when optimal compression methods are being <br>
used. In what way (the algoritm by which) this compression <br>
can be obtained is another (much more complex) problem. <br>
<p>
However there is still some time left. After the arrival <br>
of the singularity a posthuman jupiterbrain could try to <br>
spend some time to come up with a good algoritm. :-&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
When molecular tape storage systems should arive that <br>
can store 10^22 bits in a cubic centimeter, this would <br>
mean that the identities of a 1000 human equivalent <br>
individuals could be stored in a cubic millimeter (the <br>
size of a grain of salt?). <br>
<p>
<p>
Can somebody detect a fault in this reasoning?<br>
