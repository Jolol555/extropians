That's true, but I'd say that the majority of real threats to civilization<br>
in future will be human-made, not natural (with the possible exception of<br>
nearby supernovas, etc, for which we can do little until we can dismantle<br>
stars). Assuming we get past the year-2000 bug, anyway.<br>

Hit the Earth with a lump of rock fired from a mass-driver at Alpha <br>
Centauri at 99% of the speed of light, and it dies. Earth wouldn't<br>
be an easy target to hit that way, but a habitat would be almost<br>
impossible.<br>

<p>
The same energy and resource problems still apply; there's still<br>
little point in colonising Mars rather than turning it into habitats.<br>
