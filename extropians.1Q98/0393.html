19. REGENERATION OF AXONS IN CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM WHITE MATTER<br>
When examining the gross anatomy of the mammalian brain and<br>
spinal cord, a striking feature is the presence of large regions<br>
with an opalescent ivory color. The color is due to myelin, the<br>
substance that sheaths many nerve fibers in the central nervous<br>
system. In the vertebrate central nervous system, the axons of<br>
nerve cells involved in physiological functions that require<br>
rapid signaling (for example, the neural control of voluntary<br>
muscle) are wrapped in myelin with a special consequence. The<br>
myelin sheath consists of concentric layers of electrically<br>
insulating lipid material, but the sheath is periodically<br>
interrupted, and at the points where the sheath is interrupted so<br>
is the electrical insulation interrupted. The result, predictable<br>
from the classical physics of electrical transmission lines and<br>
the electrical parameters of nerve fibers, is that the propagat-<br>
ion of an electrical pulse along such nerve fibers occurs at a<br>
velocity much higher than that found in unmyelinated fibers.<br>
Glial cells are cells of the central and peripheral nervous<br>
system that metabolically support neurons and produce the<br>
multiple membrane layers called myelin and enfold nerve cell<br>
axons with it. The glial cells are found everywhere in the brain<br>
and spinal cord, and one result of a localized injury to the<br>
central nervous system is a local proliferation of glial cells to<br>
form a scar matrix. Concerning brain and spinal cord injury, it<br>
has always been a canon of neurobiology that adult central<br>
nervous system neurons cannot regenerate after injury to re-<br>
establish the connections to other cells necessary for proper<br>
functioning. Davies et al (6 authors at 2 installations, US UK),<br>
using microtransplantation techniques, now report that adult<br>
central nervous system white matter can support long-distance<br>
regeneration of adult axons provided the reactive glial<br>
extracellular matrix at the site of the lesion can be bypassed.<br>
The authors suggest this is the first time this glial barrier to<br>
axon regeneration has been noted.<br>
