You make good points, Peter. Rants-although they are fun-rarely convince<br>
anyone of anything. But a little rightuous anger isn't all bad, is it? I<br>
love reading some of the arguments of the radical abolitionists of the<br>
early 1800's. They called slavery evil and slaveholders evil people.<br>
It's exhilerating to read them. They didn't make utilitarian arguments<br>
against slavery, but they did have some effect on public opinion. Would<br>
they have done better with an economic analysis of slavery which would<br>
have shown that it made the country as a whole and the slaves, but not<br>
the individual slaveholders, economically worse off?<br>

<p>
Well, I hope my moral views are open to refinement. However, the<br>
fundamentals (slavery is wrong, etc.) are not going to change. Your mind<br>
can be so open that your brain falls out.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  My moral beliefs are ultimately based on utilitarian arguments (e.g.</i><br>
<i>&gt; comparisons such as the U.S. vs. the Soviet Union have shown that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rule "if in doubt, avoid coercion" produces results that almost all</i><br>
<i>&gt; humans prefer). I see no sign that disagreements about things like</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether torture is nice explain much of the political disputes we see</i><br>
<i>&gt; (I think Robin Hanson has a paper on his web site arguing this better</i><br>
<i>&gt; than I can).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I would be curious to hear whether you have a justification for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious-style attitude towards moral rules, or whether your</i><br>
"coercion<br>
<i>&gt; is immoral" rule is merely shorthand for something like "I've studied</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough history to know that all coercion that has been tried in</i><br>
societies<br>
<i>&gt; like ours has been unneccesary and has produced undesired results, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; we should avoid coercion until we hear a fundamentally new argument</i><br>
for <br>
it".<br>
<p>
I suppose you have to ground all moral beliefs in some sort of<br>
utilitarianism, since you can't prove an "ought." However, many<br>
so-called utilitarians neglect freedom as a utility. I'm in favor of<br>
freedom even if it means I'll be slightly worse off economically.<br>
Utilitarianism has to mean more than economic bean counting. I think<br>
only in a free market will we maximize human happiness in general.<br>
Unfortunately, however, individuals can and do maximize their happiness<br>
by coercion. That's the problem. I could have a grand old time stealing<br>
$50 million from Bill Gates (if I didn't get caught and had no<br>
conscience) and he'd probably barely miss the money. (He's not even<br>
trying to spend all his money when he's alive anyway.)<br>
