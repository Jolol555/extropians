I've just completed reading "Prometheus Rising" by Robert Anton Wilson -<br>
and I am *very* impressed and inspired by that book. I'd really<br>
appreciate some opinions from other people on this list about that<br>
particular book, since it's one of the "top-ten" books in the Extropian<br>
Principles Reading List, and it basically says what you say. Of course,<br>
it says nothing about Extropians or anybody on this list... well, at<br>
least it says that extropy/negentropy is "good" - AND it says a lot<br>
more... maybe I should put it the other way round: what you say reminds<br>
me of some things I read in that book ;-)<br>
<p>
I wonder how many people have experienced, or at least are interested in<br>
- for example - the neurosomatic circuit mentioned in Prometheus Rising,<br>
which might be a more reliable means of life-extension than having to<br>
wait for better technology (I don't see it as an "alternative", though -<br>
becoming immortal is a matter of technology because mortality is a fatal<br>
hardware-bug that you can't overrun with even the best software). Or<br>
simply checking out different reality-tunnels (which looks very much<br>
like an important part of self-transformation to me, and it is fun).<br>
<p>
On the critical side, I can think of no way of "falsifying" most of the<br>
ideas in Prometheus Rising (except for Wilson's too optimistic view of<br>
the future which was falsified by time). I'm afraid any attempt of<br>
falsifying could be simply overcome by saying "this is dogmatic circuit<br>
3 (dogmatic rationalist) argueing". That puts up the question: how<br>
useful are the models explained, to people who use them?<br>
<p>
later,<br>
