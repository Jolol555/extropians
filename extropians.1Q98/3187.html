jeff@ultraviolet.com writes regarding Richard Hoagland.<br>
<p>
I read Hoagland's book about Cydonia many years ago, and it was completely<br>
unconvincing.<br>
<p>
The problem is that the shapes are not obviously artificial.  Yes,<br>
some of them are roughly pyramidal, but I can find rocks that have a<br>
similar shape.  You have to look at the weathering and erosion and other<br>
factors that carve these rocks.  The Martian experts who have done so<br>
believe that these shapes are the products of natural erosion.<br>
<p>
Jeff also mentions Hoagland's video tape analysis of events on a 1991<br>
space shuttle flight.  This is STS-48, and a good resource for information<br>
about the controversy is <a href="http://web2.airmail.net/yogi/sts-48.html">http://web2.airmail.net/yogi/sts-48.html</a>.<br>
You can read there the questionable reasoning of the UFO believers.<br>
James Oberg, a well known space expert, says that all the video shows is<br>
particles near the shuttle being pushed by its thrusters.  See Oberg's<br>
analysis at <a href="http://web2.airmail.net/yogi/oberg.html">http://web2.airmail.net/yogi/oberg.html</a>.<br>
<p>
Hoagland's web site at <a href="http://www.enterprisemission.com">http://www.enterprisemission.com</a> claimed shortly<br>
after the Mars rover landed that they had found all kinds of artifacts in<br>
the surface pictures: military vehicles, technical equipment, cannisters<br>
of various sorts.  Everyone else just sees rocks.  Hoagland has also<br>
claimed to have seen a crystal city on the moon by enhancing Apollo<br>
images.<br>
<p>
In my mind, Hoagland has no credibility.  He may be deluding himself,<br>
or he may just be deluding others, but either way he is not a reliable<br>
source of information.<br>
