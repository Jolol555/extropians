Dear all,<br>
<p>
I thought a lot about these aspects. To me they have a<br>
very obvious relation, and I've try to make this point several<br>
times. Please read this contribution as intended, I don't want<br>
to "ride" along on somebody else his effort............<br>
<p>
I have this discussion a lot with members of Tanscedo,<br>
members of the CroNet and other private mail. I think we<br>
have to actively spread the positive meme. I usually refer<br>
to our introduction page as "cold", but we will not change <br>
it, since we have to stick to the facts and worry about <br>
scarring of the true academic-world. They want cold hard<br>
facts and like to speculate along the way. This has an<br>
obvious reason. You want to keep the people aboard<br>
who really know what is going on.<br>
<p>
Still, you want to function as a group in this society.<br>
The society is everything but "cold", it's dynamic and<br>
does a lot based on emotions. (which we "hate" because<br>
they so often contradict with what we would like to achieve<br>
based on facts). I think the majority refers to "us" as <br>
science-"fiction"-nerds. Hooked up in their own fantasy and<br>
not living in the real world. And if they do look at what we<br>
"picture" for them, they see this "Cyberpunk" world, with lots<br>
of wire's, computers and biotech "monsters"......<br>
And since they don't have the scientific background (and in<br>
relation to that the required imagination) to cope with it,<br>
they want to stay as far a way as possible. Also they<br>
will strongly influence the political-opinion.<br>
(see cloning debate)....<br>
<p>
Since I often offered my help here, I noticed people are wondering<br>
if "they" should accept it. For clarity, I don't have a Ph.D. nor<br>
do I have the University diploma's required to really grasp what<br>
is going on. (nanotechnology is for me, gluing balls together :-).<br>
No serious, I know a lot of a lot, but not much of some specific things.<br>
And I think this goes for more people. The digital-generation is<br>
eager to incorporate the new technology in their life, but they <br>
can't grasps it to the full extend as a lot of you can.<br>
<p>
So what do I think I can contribute:<br>
I plead strongly for an organization that educates people<br>
"all of them". People like to think in visuals. Let's paint them<br>
this beautiful future that is coming. Let's show them that there<br>
is a real chance to make some thing out of this: with the environment<br>
, the world hunger, war. Not by shutting down science and go back<br>
to basic "this favorite spiritual mantra", but by embracing the new<br>
technology's for the good things they bring. Yes realistic and Yes,<br>
we look at the side effects of what comes along with them.<br>
I think if Extropie &amp; Transhumanism want to grow to a well known<br>
and respected philosophy (accepted as a realistic bunch of<br>
people by the world of science) we do have to work on Marketing.<br>
......and that's were I come in ;-)<br>
<p>
I think what Nick is doing is great and I will offer again all my<br>
help. What I would like to contribute on, is the translation of<br>
all these idea's, opinions and research to the majority.<br>
To gain the benefit of the doubt. I'm realistic, I don't expect "them"<br>
to join by the 1000nds. According to a lot of you, Jim's book the <br>
"The First Immortal" can do a lot for Cryonics. I say, let's use<br>
this moment to actively make use of this and present an<br>
institute were people can learn more. Try to find company's<br>
who would like to pay a fee for visibility and an active lobby for<br>
the fields they are working in to be accepted. Although this <br>
could mean "we" have to present our selves a bit less radical.<br>
But for the sake of the good cause.........<br>
<p>
I mean. So often we discuss here that "they got it all wrong...again!"<br>
But, shouldn't we try to do something about it. Present the alternative.<br>
Make them aware there is a realistic chance on a great future.<br>
I think you have to educate them in steps. So don't trough directly,<br>
uploading at their feet :-), it scares the hell out of them.......<br>
<p>
I guess it sounds a bit like founding a new religion and some <br>
of it may also sound very idealistic. I am also aware of the<br>
fact that many of you have already tried lot's of things and that<br>
what I say here probably isn't all that new. But I think I feel<br>
a "vibe" :-). There is a lot going on, I think if we harness the <br>
"power" that is here in all of us, we could pull of a organization<br>
for the future.<br>
<p>
Anyway I am more then willing to do my part, focussing on<br>
Marketing the issue's, educating people, look actively for<br>
sponsors, etc..... all those things, not so heavily relying on<br>
scientific knowledge. Building this Worldwide Transhuman Vision.<br>
<p>
Again: my intentions are pure, positive and open.<br>
So, if you "all" feel this is a waste of time, stick to what you<br>
do best.......and go back to school :-)..........I accept it<br>
with out a problem. I do feel very passionate for "everything"<br>
that goes on here, I think it has a fundamental truth that <br>
should be shared to all who are willing to listen. We have a<br>
great chance to actually build a great future and I would like<br>
to be a part of the building process. I think there is a lot of <br>
room for an organization, that holds the alternative for all the<br>
others (e.g. religion, and other spiritual groups)<br>
<p>
Anyway, I am very eager to learn all your opinions...........<br>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
