Biotechnology Industry Organization on Cloning Legislation<br>
<p>
The following memorandum was issued by Dan Eramian, Vice President,<br>
Communications of BIO, regarding cloning legislation. <br>
<p>
The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BI0) has steadfastly<br>
opposed the cloning of a human being. The Food and Drug<br>
Administration (FDA) has already asserted its regulatory authority<br>
over cloning and announced its intention not to allow such<br>
an unsafe and unwise procedure. Still, the Senate is scheduled to<br>
take its first vote on S. 1601, Tuesday, Feb. 1O -- legislation<br>
that would not only ban the cloning of a human being, but could<br>
inadvertently interfere with ongoing and vital medical research.<br>
To avoid this, legislative language must be extremely precise,<br>
after all you are talking about legislating the world of molecular<br>
biology, which can only be seen under a microscope. <br>
<p>
Attached please find background information on this important<br>
issue. If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to<br>
call BIO at 202-857-0244. <br>
<p>
ANALYSIS OF S. 1601 TO BAN CLONING OF HUMAN BEINGS <br>
<p>
The bill to ban cloning of human beings, S. 1601, sponsored by<br>
Sens. Lott, Bond, Frist, and Gregg, makes it a federal crime --<br>
with a ten-year prison sentence and substantial civil fines -- if<br>
any individual, with or without federal finding, engages in the act<br>
of ``producing an embryo (including a preimplantation embryo)''<br>
through the use of a specified technology, somatic cell nuclear<br>
transfer. It would ban the production of this embryo even if the<br>
production of such an embryo is for purposes completely<br>
unrelated to the cloning of a human being, including for research. <br>
<p>
The bill as currently drafted prohibits many uses of somatic cell<br>
nuclear transfer related to research, separate from the goal of<br>
banning the cloning of human beings. <br>
<p>
First of all, the bill bans research to generate ``customized''<br>
stem cells to treat disease if it involves somatic cell nuclear<br>
transfer. Not all stem cell research involves somatic cell nuclear<br>
transfer. If the stem cell research does not use this technique,<br>
the research would not be banned by the bill. (See attachment,<br>
``The Science at Risk.'') <br>
<p>
The bill bans the production of an embryo (1) if it contains a<br>
fertilized nucleus, not a cloned nucleus with DNA identical to that<br>
of an existing or previously existing human being, or (2) if it<br>
contains a nucleus which has been modified in some way and is not<br>
identical to that of any person. <br>
<p>
The bill's definition of somatic cell nuclear transfer is<br>
imprecise. The bill bans the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer<br>
to transfer a ``human somatic cell'' into an egg, but it does not<br>
state that this is limited to a somatic cell which contains nuclear<br>
DNA identical to that of an existing or previously existing person.<br>
This means that the bill is not limited to cloning (creating a<br>
person or embryo with nuclear DNA identical to that of someone<br>
else), but would also apply to the use of somatic cell nuclear<br>
transfer of nuclear DNA which is not identical. As currently<br>
drafted, it would, in fact, prohibit the use of somatic cell<br>
nuclear transfer where the nuclear DNA is the product of normal,<br>
sexual reproduction, which is the opposite of cloning. In addition,<br>
the bill would also prohibit the use of somatic cell nuclear<br>
transfer where the somatic cell had been modified in some way prior<br>
to the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer. <br>
<p>
Even if the legislation were limited to the transfer of somatic<br>
cells with nuclear DNA identical to that of an existing or<br>
previously existing human being (which is not currently the case),<br>
it would still ban one type of stem cell research. This is the type<br>
of stem cell research which would create stem cells ``customized''<br>
to treat an individual patient. In this case a researcher or doctor<br>
could create a human zygote to start a customized stem cell line<br>
with DNA identical to that of an existing or previously existing<br>
person through the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to treat<br>
the individual from whom the DNA was extracted. By using the<br>
same DNA to treat the individual, the stem cell would more likely<br>
be compatible and not rejected by the person when the stem<br>
cell is transferred back to the person for treatment. <br>
<p>
Finally, the bill would ban the use of somatic cell nuclear<br>
transfer to treat mitochondrial disease. For example, a<br>
nonidentical nucleus, such as a fertilized nucleus, is transferred<br>
from a person with mitochondrial disease into a healthy egg from<br>
which the nucleus has been removed. This treatment has already been<br>
successfully used to treat infertility. <br>
<p>
Section 5 of the bill is entitled ``Unrestricted Scientific<br>
Research'' which states, ``Nothing in this Act (or an amendment<br>
made by this Act) shall be construed to restrict areas of<br>
scientific research that are not specifically prohibited by this<br>
Act (or amendments).'' This provision uses circular reasoning. It<br>
merely states that the bill does what it does and does not do what<br>
it does not do. The provision does nothing to modify the<br>
prohibitions on research. <br>
<p>
To ensure that customized stem cell research is not banned by the<br>
bill, it must be substantially revised. One approach would be<br>
to include a broad exemption for biomedical research on stem cells<br>
and other technology to treat patients. <br>
<p>
The bill includes: <br>
<p>
 no preemption of inconsistent state laws; and <br>
 no sunset to ensure that it is reviewed. <br>
 It creates a new entity to review the ethics of this issue, an<br>
 entity which is separate from and duplicative to the National    <br>
 Bioethics Advisory Commission. <br>
<p>
The Science at Risk <br>
<p>
Pending legislation regarding human cloning includes over broad<br>
definitions which put the science described in this paper at<br>
risk. <br>
<p>
Scientists are developing an entirely new approach for treating<br>
human diseases that depend not on drugs like antibiotics but on<br>
living cells that can differentiate into blood, skin, heart, or<br>
brain cells and potentially treat cancers, spinal cord injuries, or<br>
heart disease. This research -- called stem cell research -- holds<br>
the potential to develop and improve cancer treatments by gaining<br>
a more complete understanding of cell division and growth and the<br>
process of metastasis. This could also lead to a variety of<br>
cancer treatment advances. <br>
<p>
The kinds of cells that make up most of the human body are<br>
differentiated, meaning that they have already achieved some sort<br>
of specialized function such as blood, skin, heart or brain cells.<br>
The precursor cells that led to differentiated cells come from the<br>
embryo. They are called stem cells because functions stem from them<br>
like the growth of a plant. Stem cells have the capacity<br>
for self-renewal, meaning that they can produce more of themselves,<br>
and differentiation, meaning that they can specialize into a<br>
variety of cell types with different functions. In the last decade,<br>
scientists studying mice and other laboratory animals have<br>
discovered powerful new approaches involving cultured stem cells.<br>
Studies of such cells obtained from mouse stem cells show<br>
that they are capable of differentiating in vitro or in vivo into<br>
a wide variety of specialized cell types. Stem cells have been<br>
derived by culturing cells of non-human primates and promising<br>
efforts to obtain human stem cells have also recently been<br>
reported. <br>
<p>
Stem cell research has been hailed as the ``(m)ost tantalizing of<br>
all'' research in this field. The reason for this is because adults<br>
do not have many stem cells. Most cells are fully differentiated<br>
into their proper functions. When differentiated cells are<br>
damaged, such as cardiac muscle when someone suffers a heart<br>
attack, the adult cells do not have the ability to regenerate. If<br>
stem cells could be derived from human sources and induced to<br>
differentiate in vitro, they could potentially be used for<br>
transplantation and tissue repair. <br>
<p>
Using the heart attack sufferer as an example, we might be able to<br>
replace damaged cardiac cells with healthy stem cells that<br>
could differentiate into cardiac muscle. Research with these stem<br>
cells could lead to the development of ``universal donor cells''<br>
of invaluable benefit to patients. Stem cell therapy could make it<br>
possible to store tissue reserves that would give health care<br>
providers a wholly new and virtually endless supply of: <br>
<p>
cardiac muscle cells to treat heart attack victims and degenerative<br>
heart disease; <br>
<p>
skin cells to treat burn victims; <br>
<p>
spinal cord neuron cells for treatment of spinal cord trauma and <br>
paralysis; <br>
<p>
neural cells for treating those suffering from neurodegenerative<br>
diseases; <br>
<p>
pancreas cells to treat diabetes; <br>
<p>
blood cells to treat cancer anemia and immunodeficiencies; <br>
<p>
neural cells to treat Parkinson's, Huntington's and Amyotrophic<br>
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS); <br>
<p>
cells for use in genetic therapy to treat 5,000 genetic diseases, <br>
including Cystic Fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease, schizophrenia,<br>
depression, and other diseases; <br>
<p>
blood vessel endothelial cells for treating atherosclerosis; <br>
<p>
liver cells for liver diseases including hepatitis and cirrhosis; <br>
<p>
cartilage cells for treatment of osteoarthritis; <br>
<p>
bone cells for treatment of osteoporosis; <br>
<p>
myoblast cells for the treatment of Muscular Dystrophy; <br>
<p>
respiratory epithelial cells for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis<br>
and lung cancer; <br>
<p>
adrenal cortex cells for the treatment of Addison's disease; <br>
<p>
retinal pigment epithelial cells for age-related macular<br>
degeneration; <br>
<p>
modified cells for treatment of various genetic diseases; <br>
<p>
and other cells for use in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention<br>
of other deadly or disabling diseases or other medical conditions. <br>
<p>
The use of stem cells to create these therapies would lead to great<br>
medical advances. We have to be sure that nothing we do in<br>
this legislation concerning human cloning would obstruct in any way<br>
this vital research. <br>
<p>
Note: A researcher/doctor might want to ``create a human zygote<br>
with DNA identical to that of an existing or previously<br>
existing person through the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer''<br>
in order to create a customized stem cell line to treat the<br>
individual from whom the DNA was extracted. By using the same DNA<br>
the stem cell would be more likely to be compatible and not<br>
rejected by the person when the stem cell is transferred (back)<br>
to the person for the treatment. The language in brackets would<br>
prohibit this technology even though its sole purpose is to provide<br>
medical treatment for the individual, not for reproduction<br>
(cloning) of that individual. <br>
