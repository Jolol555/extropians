I agree, with the reservation that pleasure/contentment/joy can also be<br>
something that is gained 'on a higher level' whilst doing something you<br>
don't specifically like (in helping out someone else for instance).<br>
<p>
<p>

"why" <br>

<i> &gt;purpose, this conscious life we have been given, but at least we can</i><br>
enjoy the <br>
<i> &gt;ride.</i><br>
<p>
And a good thing too, I dread the day that someone figures out 'the meaning<br>
of life'. 'Cause next thing you know it'll turn out that some things I<br>
enjoy doing most are not in accordance with some 'greater purpose'. One<br>
cannot go against the will of God so I'm happy he is either non-existent or<br>
not showing himself.<br>
(and _of course_ I will give disobedience my best shot if he ever does show<br>
up without some very good answers for certain things ;-)<br>

Happily agnostic (sort of),<br>
