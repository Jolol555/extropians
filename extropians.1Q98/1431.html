I thought that extropy in its classical formulation was precisely a<br>
measure of intelligence, information, energy, vitality, experience,<br>
diversity, and opportunity for growth, and so that the<br>
broadening and complicating of ethical perception would pretty<br>
self-evidently be extropian.  It's an ethical analog to pancritical<br>
rationalism.   It is an embracing of the moral  richness of the<br>
world.  To say that you "accept" complexity when its "unavoidable" <br>
suggests that it is scarcely a value at all.  I agree that it is possible<br>
to overcomplicate situations from time to time, with the consequence that<br>
you are, say, sometimes more hesitant to act or less confident in acting<br>
than you need to be.  But this seems like a reasonable tradeoff for<br>
cultivating the widest possible appreciation of the world.  One of the<br>
reasons I am a vegetarian is that I found the world became more<br>
interesting and more beautiful when I started thinking of nonhuman animals<br>
less as putty and more like peers.  <br>
 <br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
I said vegetarian practice was an ethical *laboratory*, by which I meant<br>
the kind of thinking that happens when you try things out in practice as<br>
well as in thought.  A person who decides to become an ethical vegetarian<br>
faces lots of unexpected decisions -- what about fish? leather? wool? <br>
medical services? etc. -- that have a special urgency and clarity that you<br>
are not likely to face simply thinking about these things in the abstract. <br>

Best, Dale<br>
