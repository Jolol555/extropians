With all this talk about "Virtual Obsession" spreading memes, it makes me<br>
wonder if people on this list have watched episodes of "The Outer Limits"?<br>
I have been taping them weekly for a couple of months.  They have had<br>
episodes about the following subjects:<br>
<p>
- Cryonics, being frozen and coming back<br>
- Transferring consciousness to a new body before death, including<br>
transferring multiple consciousnesses into a single body<br>
- An AI program that becomes sentient and demands equal rights, and finally<br>
decides to ignore the physical human and deciding that the VR people are<br>
more real, and the last physical human is irrelevant<br>
- A world where everyone is in communication on a giant network with neural<br>
chips built right into their heads from birth<br>
- Many episodes where humans are extinct or close to extinct and replaced<br>
by robots who continue society<br>
- Lots of genetic engineering episodes, or end-of-the-world episodes where<br>
only genetic engineering can make humanity survive in an altered form<br>
- Lots of episodes where final humans turn against other humans in favor of<br>
aliens, robots, AIs or other forms of life, deciding that humans aren't<br>
automatically superior that other forms of life<br>
- etc.<br>
<p>
Some of these show the horrors of the technology.  Some of these are too<br>
fluffy-sweet showing that technology is so wonderful that we were idiots to<br>
ever have war, disagreements, or boredom because technology solves<br>
everything.<br>
<p>
My favorite part about the series is that each episode is written by a<br>
different author and has a different point of view and different<br>
characters.  Unlike Babylon 5, Star Trek(s) and X-Files, which are all<br>
locked into the same characters and the same tired points of view, these<br>
are different points of view every time.<br>
<p>
It may be more effective to spread memes via a TV series rather than<br>
individual movies.  Then we could have a different author and story idea<br>
every week.<br>
