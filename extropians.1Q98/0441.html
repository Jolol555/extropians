<p>
If by "rejecting" you mean not bothering to think about it any more, and I <br>
can't imagine of what else you could mean, then I disagree, contradictory  <br>
evidence is only one reason to send an idea to the junk heap. Given the fact  <br>
that there are an infinite number of potential theories and only a finite <br>
amount of time, any theory that complicates things, predicts nothing new, and <br>
can never be proven wrong, does not deserve further consideration. Time spent <br>
on a barren theory means time not spent looking for something better. <br>
<p>
At any rate, the theists can't say their idea was not given a fair hearing, <br>
it has obsessed billions of people for thousands of years and produced <br>
nothing. There must have a hardware bug in many human minds that makes them <br>
go into an endless loop when exposed to the "God" meme.<br>

<i>	&gt;There is a huge variety of God concepts. [...] regarding omnipotence </i><br>

<i>	&gt;every God concept includes God being omnipotent and omniscient.</i><br>
	    <br>
<p>
It sounds to me like you have a stronger commitment to the word "God" than <br>
the idea of God. If you make the God concept fuzzy enough then I would be <br>
unable to disagree with it, and be even more unable to find a use for it.<br>

<i>	&gt;The idea that our universe was created by an intelligent being is </i><br>
<i>	&gt;very attractive to most people.</i><br>
	    <br>
<p>
Apparently, and the intelligent being would doubtless find the idea <br>
attractive to explain His own existence too.<br>
	    <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;I prefer not to close my mind prematurely on any subject.  </i><br>
	    <br>
<p>
The important word is "prematurely". A totally open mind is no better than a <br>
totally closed one, both are equally sterile. There are no guaranties, all I <br>
can say is that a creative mind uses judgment to sort those ideas that might <br>
produce something interesting from those ideas unlikely to do so.<br>
