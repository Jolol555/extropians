Sorry if I over generalized. A reference to a movie like Contact is a poor<br>
reference at best.<br>

<i>&gt; If you speak for the majority, ok. But somehow I don't think this is a</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; misuse of advancements in science which have led to one of the worst eras</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It ain't quite the scientist's fault, nicht wahr? An advancement in the</i><br>

<i>&gt; braindead implementation of the principle which causes measurable impact.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We can hardly abscond the whole idea of doing scientic research if the</i><br>

<p>
Politicians, lobbyists and corporate directors don't have the scientific ability<br>
(usually) to execute an operation, they still leave this privilege to science.<br>
Just because someone asked you to design a nuclear reactor, this doesn't somehow<br>
remove your responsibility from the process. I'm certainly not saying that ALL<br>
scientists have contributed directly, but once again, I was making a loose<br>
generalization.<br>

Where are my smart drugs. I want two pills, one which will give me photographic<br>
memories and another which will diffuse memories within the past two days.<br>
