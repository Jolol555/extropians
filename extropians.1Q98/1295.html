Well, the Earth did not have an environmental conflict with the human<br>
species until a large percentage started evolving, (genetically or<br>
memetically does not matter) toward an herbivore lifestyle. It has since<br>
pushed out and occupied most of the most ecologically viable land area in<br>
the world, and is making a good attempt at exterminating the rest within<br>
the nexx half century. If humans had remained hunter gatherers, the earth<br>
would not be in the environmental fix it is in. While it is now making an<br>
attempt at stabilizing its current environmental damages, it is not making<br>
any attempt at limiting the population growth, which is the main problem.<br>
Any ecologist will tell you that the way to stabilize a large population<br>
of herbivores is to introduce and support a population of predators, and<br>
if that is not viable, then to use such measures as hunting to manage the<br>
herd. If this is the case with other herbivores, why are environmentalists<br>
not applying the same standard to humans?, why do environmentalists<br>
typically take the exact opposite stand with humans when such culling<br>
activities like war and sickness are involved? Charlie Stross, in another<br>
message, contests my standard of not eating intelligent beings, which is<br>
where environmentalists seem to also be setting their hypocritical line in<br>
the sand, yet he cannot recognise the blinders that he is wearing.<br>
<p>
Granted, I don't like the idea, I'm just demanding that people with<br>
certain stands demonstrate consistency and integrity with their policies.<br>
I demand the same from myself. I personally like eating meat, as do other<br>
members of my family. We also are honest enough that we take part in<br>
hunting activities to manage wild herds of herbivores. We also have an<br>
current average life expectancy of my grandparents generation that is up<br>
in the 90's, so given better health current care technology, I'll easily<br>
expect to live over 100 without any new fangled life extension techniques,<br>
while still living a carnivorous lifestyle.<br>
<p>
If people are going to be vegan AND be such ardent environmentalists, then<br>
they honestly must recognise that since humanity is mostly drifting toward<br>
an herbivorous lifestyle, then for environmental stability's sake, there<br>
must be a predator(s) to occupy the top spot in our food chain to manage<br>
the herd.<br>
