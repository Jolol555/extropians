<i>&gt;From the White House press office--Al Gore's latest attempt to cast</i><br>
himself as a futurist, by proposing a feel-good, wasteful diversion<br>
from other exploration projects. (Not to mention the retrograde <br>
symbolism of gazing nonstop on the Earth after a year in which humans <br>
achieved their deepest sightings into the far reaches of the galaxy, <br>
with Hubble and Deep Field.)<br>
<p>
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Friday March 13, 1998<br>
<p>
VICE PRESIDENT GORE CHALLENGES NASA TO BUILD A NEW SATELLITE TO <br>
PROVIDE LIVE IMAGES OF EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE<br>
<p>
Vice President Gore proposed today that NASA scientists and engineers <br>
design, build and operate a satellite that will make available a live <br>
image of earth 24 hours a day on the Internet.<br>
<p>
In a speech at the National Innovation Summit at MIT, the Vice <br>
President proposed that NASA launch a new micro satellite that will <br>
provide live images of the earth from space by the year 2000.  This <br>
satellite will depict the motions of changing clouds, the advance of <br>
hurricanes, large-scale fires in oil fields or forests and other <br>
phenomena at the precise moment they occur.<br>
<p>
'This new satellite, called Triana, will allow people around the <br>
globe to gaze at our planet as it travels in its orbit around the sun <br>
for the first time in history' Vice President Gore said.  'With the <br>
next millenium just around the corner, developing this High <br>
Definition TV quality image of the full disk of the continuously lit <br>
Earth and making it available 24 hours a day on the Internet will <br>
awaken a new generation to the environment and educate millions of <br>
children around the globe.'<br>
<p>
'This new space craft will be carred into low earth orbit where a <br>
small motor will place it in orbit 1 million miles from earth at the <br>
L1 point (short for the Langrangian liberation point), the point <br>
between the earth and sun where gravitational attractions are <br>
balanced.  The satellite will carry a small telescope and camera to <br>
provide these new compelling images.  In the history of space <br>
exploration there are only a few photographs of the full earth that <br>
have resonated with the public.  Christmas 1968 was an epiphany for <br>
many Americans, when they first saw the image 'earth rising'.  It is <br>
considered one of the fundamentally profound images of this century.  <br>
Another photograph, the Blue Marble, taken in 1972 during Apollo 17, <br>
began an era of global awareness.'<br>
