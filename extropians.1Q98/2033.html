I was recently introduced to a very interesting variation of socialism that<br>
many people on this list may find interesting.  From what I have been able<br>
to determine, this model fixes several of the most disagreeable aspects of<br>
the traditional socialist model.  As an extra bonus, this model has been<br>
very successfully implemented in the United States (though not under the<br>
auspices of the US govt) for the better part of a century.<br>
<p>
<p>
The model is essentially the application of commercial corporate entities<br>
as social welfare agents.  The history of the specific example I was<br>
introduced to is as follows (regretfully I can not remember the specific<br>
names of many of the entities involved):<br>
<p>
Earlier this century, a community received a large windfall from the<br>
federal government.  But rather than spending the money, the community used<br>
the money to form a commercial corporation with the intent of doing<br>
business.  Every member of the community was given a single share in the<br>
corporation.  Every child born to a member of the community was also given<br>
a share, but the share was not vested until the child became an adult,<br>
iirc.  Additionally, since new shares are issued to every generation, when<br>
a person dies, their share is voided.  The community made a conscious<br>
decision not to start issuing dividends for 10 or 15 years after the<br>
initial formation of the corporation.<br>
<p>
Anyway, the bottom line is the corporation in question (the name escapes<br>
me) is currently a large multi-national and issues dividends of $20-30k<br>
(and growing) annually to every adult shareholder.  The corporation is for<br>
all intents and purposes the local government for this community.  The<br>
corporation "donates" a significant amount of resources to its community<br>
(which doubles as a benefit and a tax write-off), but only so far as it<br>
doesn't damage the bottom line of the corporation.  However, unlike most<br>
governments, the corporation does not give preferential treatment or<br>
employment to members of the community (it *is* a commercial business),<br>
regularly employing qualified outsiders.  <br>
<p>
<p>
There are a number of interesting ramifications and aspects of this as a<br>
model of government.<br>
<p>
First, because payouts to the community are based on the profitability of<br>
the corporation/government (not on tax distributions), it is in the<br>
interest of the community to minimize plundering as this leads to<br>
short-term and long-term cuts in payouts to the individual shareholders.<br>
This is especially effective because every member of the community has an<br>
equal vote; any special minority interests are strongly out-weighed by the<br>
community at large because there is no real means under corporate law by<br>
which any small interest could gain any significant advantage in this<br>
scenario.  Additionally, because payouts are not linked to taxes, there is<br>
far more interest in minimizing the expenses of the corporation rather than<br>
trying to recover taxes already payed.<br>
<p>
Second, because government/corporate payouts are issued as dividends rather<br>
than "programs", this allows members of the community to take customize<br>
their benefits to their wishes.  Any public benefits given by the<br>
corporation are only done when optimal i.e. allowing the community to use<br>
resources of the corporation at no significant loss to the corporation, or<br>
as a long-term investment in future profitability of the corporation (like<br>
making useful donations to the local schools to build a better employment<br>
pool).<br>
<p>
Additionally there is the obvious benefit of government without<br>
politicians.  If a employee of the corporation or board of directors<br>
doesn't do their job, it shows up in the profitability (something the<br>
community feels directly) and incompetent individuals can be replaced<br>
readily at any time.  The only way an individual can make a career at this<br>
is if they do a good job (people are not hired based on ideology).<br>
<p>
The key points here are that there is more accountability in this type of<br>
government, although there isn't a whole lot of governing going on;<br>
everything is driven by the economic self-interest of the community.  Also,<br>
with a profit-based government there appears to be something of a virtuous<br>
cycle that develops as opposed to the vicious cycle of a taxation-based<br>
government.  And while this model looks similar to socialism in many ways,<br>
it leaves a lot more to the choice of the individual rather than the<br>
"government knows best" attitude of traditional socialism and distributes<br>
resources much more equally without leaving anyone out or taxing the wealthy.<br>
<p>
<p>
I thought this might be an interesting topic of discussion.  As I mentioned<br>
at the top, this model has been applied very successfully on at least one<br>
occassion (I actually learned about this from my father, who knows a couple<br>
people who are shareholders of this corporation).<br>
