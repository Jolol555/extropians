<i>&gt; I would think also urine analysis, perhaps done spectrally or through a</i><br>

<i>&gt; How about finding out what basically goes wrong -- i.e., what chemical</i><br>
<i>&gt; changes happen in blood, urine, etc. -- and developing simple solution</i><br>
<i>&gt; tests for those?  In other words, mix 1cc of blood with the kit's blood test</i><br>
<i>&gt; solution A and depending on what color it changes, this tells you if blood</i><br>
<i>&gt; LDL levels are too high?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Something like this might prove marketable now.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, although drawing blood is a problem for the market (can you draw<br>
1 cc blood yourself without hurting you?). If you need a blood test,<br>
it must be able to work on just a drop of blood to be<br>
marketable. Urine tests are easier, but urine doesn't contain all the<br>
stuff we would like to measure.<br>
<p>
There are a lot of information in the blood. Kinase levels tell about<br>
muscle damage (esp. infarcts), there are several marker molecules for<br>
liver or kidney diseases, LDL and antibody levels are interesting and<br>
so on. But to interpret these results well you need some expertise,<br>
even 100% healthy people tend to have at least some odd values. <br>
<p>
Anyway, I think there really exists fairly simple tests for many of<br>
these chemicals. What is needed now is packaging them together,<br>
creating a simple user interface and marketing it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can imagine doing very simple tests, such as those of reaction time to</i><br>
<i>&gt; visual stimuli combined with a measurement of neurotransmitter levels...</i><br>
<p>
Yes, and a glucose level test together with some memory tests (this is<br>
something I actually plan to do later this spring).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is not as glamorous as the other two you mention, but if we start</i><br>
<i>&gt; out with a simpler goal we might achieve it, market it, and move on to</i><br>
<i>&gt; some more complex/interesting.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. <br>
