<i>&gt;to identify with the prison guards.  It is an act of survival</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the part of the prisoner: by identifying with his captors,</i><br>
<i>&gt;he can withstand the torture and violence that he is subject</i><br>
<i>&gt;to.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This well-identified mechanism, known as "The Stockholm</i><br>
<i>&gt;Syndrome" may be readily used to explain why NSPIC becomes</i><br>
<i>&gt;so deeply ingrained in the psyche of most individuals.</i><br>
<p>
NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic Political Illusion Complex.<br>
NSPIC consists of pemes (political memes) plus the<br>
Peme Rules.  See '#TL07E: NSPIC DEBATE #1' --<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm</a>&gt; and<br>

<i>&gt;I believe that there are strong similarities between</i><br>
<i>&gt;the cases of:</i><br>
<i>&gt;[class 1] individuals in an overtly hostile situation,</i><br>
<i>&gt;such as overt prisoner situation, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;[class 2] those who live under a government where the</i><br>
<i>&gt;immediate threat of violence is somewhat less apparent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;These two classes are described as follows:</i><br>
<i>&gt;-----</i><br>
<i>&gt;Class 1: The individual's safety and life is at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;mercy of cruel and unpredictable captors.  The captors</i><br>
<i>&gt;threaten to kill the individual and are perceived to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be capable of doing so.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Class 2: The individual perceives his safety and</i><br>
<i>&gt;life to be at the mercy of unpredictable terrorcrats</i><br>
<i>&gt;who may use violence to enforce their wishes.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;terrorcrats threaten to kill, imprison, or take away</i><br>
<i>&gt;everything valuable to the individual and are perceived</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be capable of doing so.</i><br>
<p>
"Terrorcrat" = terrorist bureaucrat or coercive political<br>
agent -- usually written "terrocrat."  Phobocrat is used<br>
in the same sense.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;-----</i><br>
<i>&gt;Class 1:  The individual cannot escape.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Class 2:  The individual believes that he cannot escape.</i><br>
<i>&gt;----- </i><br>
<i>&gt;Class 1:  The individual is isolated from support, or in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the case of hostages, the knowledge that other people are</i><br>
<i>&gt;trying to help them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Class 2:  The individual is isolated from support, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;discredits any support that he might see.</i><br>
<i>&gt;-----</i><br>
<i>&gt;Class 1:  The captor shows kindness as well as violence,</i><br>
<i>&gt;increasing the individual's sense of being totally</i><br>
<i>&gt;dependent on the captor.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Class 2:  The bureaucrats show kindness as well</i><br>
<i>&gt;as violence and unpredictability, increasing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual's sense of being totally  dependent</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the government.</i><br>
<i>&gt;-----</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In this syndrome, all the individual's attention is</i><br>
<i>&gt;focused on survival. The individual clings to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;captor because the captor has complete power over</i><br>
<i>&gt;him. If the captor doesn't use this power, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual feels grateful and in his mind the</i><br>
<i>&gt;abuser becomes a good guy.  The individual also</i><br>
<i>&gt;knows that any expression of anger, resentment,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or challenge to the captor's power will result</i><br>
<i>&gt;in violence.  (Sound familiar?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are four stages in Stockholm syndrome:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Disbelief and denial.  "This isn't happening."</i><br>
<i>&gt;The person refuses to believe the evidence that</i><br>
<i>&gt;he sees.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. Acceptance.  The person comes to identify</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the captors/terrorcrats, and believes that</i><br>
<i>&gt;his life depends on them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. Escape/release from situation, accompanied</i><br>
<i>&gt;by depression and post-traumatic stress.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual is separated from the source of his</i><br>
<i>&gt;identity, and feels lost without it.  In addition,</i><br>
<i>&gt;he may continue to identify with the former captor,</i><br>
<i>&gt;going to such lengths as trying to defend the</i><br>
<i>&gt;captor, and even re-entering the previous </i><br>
<i>&gt;relationship.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;4. Integration of the experience; re-establishing</i><br>
<i>&gt;personal identity; acknowledgement of the horror</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the captor's acts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Stage 3 may be correlated with f-prime's description</i><br>
<i>&gt;of some libertarians, who have managed to lose some</i><br>
<i>&gt;of their "surface pemes," but are still have an</i><br>
<i>&gt;intrinsic commitment to their captors.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Stage 4 hints at potential processes to discover and</i><br>
<i>&gt;release the deeper beliefs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;----------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;How we burned in the prison camps later thinking:  What</i><br>
<i>&gt;would things have been like if every police operative,</i><br>
<i>&gt;when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been</i><br>
<i>&gt;uncertain whether he would return alive?  If during</i><br>
<i>&gt;periods of mass arrests people had not simply sat there</i><br>
<i>&gt;in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;had understood they had nothing to lose and had boldly</i><br>
<i>&gt;set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen</i><br>
<i>&gt;people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else </i><br>
<i>&gt;was at hand? -- the organs would very quickly have</i><br>
<i>&gt;suffered a shortage of officers -- and, notwithstanding</i><br>
<i>&gt;all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have</i><br>
<i>&gt;ground to a halt. -- Alexander Solzhenitsyn</i><br>
<p>
This is a great contribution to understanding why so<br>
many freedom lovers support the terrocrats at the<br>
most fundamental or semantic level.  Peme Rule 19:<br>
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary<br>
peme purveyors) communicate -- although<br>
they may question, attack, and expose a<br>
few surface pemes -- they shall make a<br>
special effort to use deep pemes in their<br>
language -- in order to maximize peme<br>
survival and propagation."<br>
<p>
The word "government" is one of the most pernicious deep<br>
pemes.  The falsely-called "constitution" is a fraud, hoax,<br>
and sham.  The hucksters who masquerade as "president,"<br>
"congressmen," etc. are liars and imposters.  The false<br>
notion that these terrocrats constitute "the government"<br>
is central to NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic Political Illusion<br>
Complex.  To habitually call these phobocrats "government"<br>
(using the word as if valid) is a lie, a gross and harmful<br>
misrepresentation of reality.<br>
<p>
To use the word "government" as if valid, is to conceal<br>
the fact that the entire "political system" is a hoax,<br>
fraud, and sham.  It's a form of identifying with the<br>
terrocrats.<br>
<p>
The power of terrocrats depends most fundamentally on<br>
words such as "constitution," "government," "state,"<br>
etc. not being challenged, i.e., using them as if valid.<br>
<p>
(Caveat: Most people operate at a level such that it's<br>
not appropriate to challenge the terrocrat lexicon in<br>
their presence -- they'll simply think you're crazy<br>
and you'll lose your audience.  Great care needs to<br>
be taken to challenge basic terrocrat words (deep<br>
pemes) when it's appropriate to do so.)<br>
<p>
Report '#TL50C: Bought-Into-The-System' expands on<br>
several issues relevant to this topic.  Interestingly,<br>
it includes a section on "Identifying with the Enemy"<br>
