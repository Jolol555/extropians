What I find interesting, is why haven't IT workers, especially 'Microserfs' formed<br>
some kind of union or protection scheme to save themselves from increasing<br>
exploitation and possible termination?  One thing is for certain, there has never<br>
been a more prosperous or intelligent workforce as exists withing the IT<br>
industry.  You would think that as soon as Microsoft proposes to eliminate<br>
overtime pay, that 20,000 workers would then go on strike and essentially shut<br>
down Microsoft - wouldn't this be crippling?  After all isn't there a severe IT<br>
shortage that we all keep hearing about?<br>
