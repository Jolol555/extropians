<i>&gt;&gt; June 20, 1998 - The FDA authorizes human trials on a robot to assist</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in brain surgery.  The one-tenth-inch-diameter robotic probe, which uses</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; neural net software to survey the brain, is equipped with pressure sensors</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; allowing it to locate edges of tumors without damaging arteries or nerves.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm guessing, since he put this so near, that there is such a device</i><br>
<i>&gt;under development in the lab.  I don't know anything about it, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would be very surprised if we had human trials on a brain surgery</i><br>
<i>&gt;robot in 6 months!  The FDA is known to be extremely cautious about</i><br>
<i>&gt;new technologies.  I'd want a robot helping with an appendectomy long</i><br>
<i>&gt;before I'd trust it to do brain surgery.</i><br>
<p>
 I think he's only off by a small amount here. From _Barron's_, 1/5/98,<br>
page MW9 blurb on Computer Motion (NASDAQ:RBOT):<br>
 "The FDA cleared the sale of the company's voice-controlled surgical<br>
 robots, called the Aesop 3000, which are used in minimally invasive<br>
 heart surgery."<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; January 11, 1999 - Michigan sees new economic growth, possibly the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; result of having recently eliminated juries in all nonfederal civil</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; trials.</i><br>
<p>
 I'm puzzled by the connection between economic growth and jury trials.<br>
I guess I need to read the book.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I can't believe that any state would remove the right to trial by jury,</i><br>
<i>&gt;even in civil trials, not within this next year, anyway.</i><br>
<p>
 The 6th and 7th amendments look clear enough that there shouldn't be<br>
any risk of this; however, this quote from a 1996 story makes me wonder:<br>
<p>
	WASHINGTON, June 24 (UPI) -- The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 Monday a  <br>
defendant who is prosecuted in a single trial for multiple petty <br>
offenses does not have a constitutional right to a jury trial, even if <br>
the penalties add up to more than six months. <br>
	But at least four justices issued warnings about the dangers of  <br>
straying too far in the direction of trials by judges only. <br>
	Under Supreme Court precedent, a jury is not required in general when  <br>
a single crime is punishable by less than six months in prison. <br>
	In a New York case, however, a former mail carrier faced multiple  <br>
charges, each punishable by less than six months in prison. <br>
	The Supreme Court said Monday that is constitutional.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; July 5, 2005 - Over half the world's population, and nearly 98% of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; American households, are now hooked to the Internet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's going to have to be a lot of wiring in China over the next 7.5</i><br>
<i>&gt;years for this one to come true.  There's a big fraction of the world's</i><br>
<i>&gt;population who don't even have electricity now, let alone telephones.</i><br>
<p>
 Wiring isn't the only way to get there - direct satellite communications<br>
are possible. Although his numbers sound high even after accounting for that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;He also has over 30,000 people being cryonically suspended during the</i><br>
<i>&gt;year 2005, while we know there will probably be no more than a dozen</i><br>
<i>&gt;or so in 1998.  Granted, in the story, there is a famous artist whose</i><br>
<i>&gt;father and niece both get cryonically suspended, leading to a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;publicity about it, so maybe in that fictional world it makes sense.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But it seems like a real long shot in our world.</i><br>
<p>
 I think that a discovery in the next few years of a cryoprotectant good<br>
enough to revive mammals might attract that many people, but publicity<br>
alone clearly won't.<br>

<i>&gt;Science fiction authors often succumb to the temptation to have their</i><br>
<i>&gt;future characters talk about the mistakes of the 20th century - if</i><br>
<i>&gt;only they'd taken care of the environment, or if only they'd been more</i><br>
<i>&gt;socialist, no, if only they'd been more capitalist, etc.  I never find</i><br>

<i>&gt;the 1890's?), and even when it does fit, I don't necessarily think the</i><br>
<i>&gt;future characters are right (people today disagree over the morality</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the "robber barons" of the 19th century, even with 100 years of</i><br>
<i>&gt;hindsight).</i><br>
<p>
 I'd suggest the question "why were people so complacent about the Nazi's<br>
in the 1930's?" as a good example. Or why weren't blacks treated like<br>
human beings in the south.<br>
 Or things like opposition to anesthesia research. See a long list in:<br>
&lt;a href="<a href="http://www.foresight.org/News/negativeComments.html">http://www.foresight.org/News/negativeComments.html</a>"&gt;Erroneous Predictions&lt;/a&gt;.<br>
 Of course it takes an unusually good SF writer to get this right.<br>
