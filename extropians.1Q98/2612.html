Michael Lorrey wrote 3/7/98: &lt;That being said [namely that everything can't<br>
be digital], when people refer to the digital vs. analog dichotomy, they<br>
really mean binary vs. analog.  When people think 'digital' they mean that<br>
they are thinking in terms of b&amp;w, on/off, flip/flop, rather than the many<br>
shades of grey that most people prefer to muddy their thinking with. This<br>
is why Mr. Jones objects to seeing AI's as 'human' since they will be much<br>
more logical and straightforward than humans, and will not be prone to the<br>
grey muddy thinking that he sees as the hallmark of 'human' intelligence.&gt;<br>
<p>
Digital v. analog is useful up to a point, in that in our computer-besotted<br>
age, that's the metaphor "in the air" that gives rise to kooky notions of<br>
ourselves as information processors, just as previous ages foolishly<br>
thought of us as mechanical clocks or thermodynamic heat engines or<br>
cybernetic feedback controllers.  As a species, we are always trying to<br>
turn ourselves inside out, to externalize concretely what is in us.  We<br>
produce the theoretical and technological systems, then turn around and<br>
say, yup, that's us.<br>
<p>
The digital v. analog metaphor stands in place of whatever is really going<br>
on at the ontological level, which in a very clumsy fashion, since I have<br>
not developed the proper concepts for it yet, I will attempt to get across.<br>
 The digital stands in for the succession of indivisible Planck moments,<br>
the passage of time.  The analog stands in for the infinitely divisible<br>
atemporal microcausality leading up to the selection of the next Planck<br>
moment, the formation of continuous space.  Consciousness is made up of<br>
both parts.  Higher consciousness developed with improved memory, both<br>
genetic and conceptual, but from the beginning of its evolution,<br>
consciousness had access to the atemporal microcausality in the<br>
backwards-in-time direction to develop purposes independent of the purposes<br>
given it.  A purely digital mechanism cannot access this, it would be,<br>
metaphorically, memory only, not imagination.  Correspondingly, "muddy"<br>
thinking is the only thinking possible since imagination precedes and<br>
guides rationality.<br>

Gary47 wrote 3/7/98: &lt;Obligations are enforced by ones own conscience. <br>
Moral imperatives must not be enforced by the state.&gt;<br>
<p>
Laws are theoretical moral imperatives, obviously.  Enforcement of laws is<br>
enforcement of moral imperatives.  Where the subject population has a<br>
highly developed conscience, laws are virtually unnecessary.  Laws<br>
proliferate when consciences are underdeveloped, as in our barbaric time.<br>
<p>
G47: &lt;The moral bankruptcy of the welfare state is self-evident, when you<br>
consider that it would not exist without the police power of taxation.  If<br>
it were truly the solution to the problems it proposed to solve, then the<br>
welfare state would be instituted by the voluntary charitable giving of<br>
those with more to those with less.&gt;<br>
<p>
Obviously, only morally bankrupt voters could have brought the welfare<br>
state into being and they continue to prop it up.  The voters' moral<br>
bankruptcy is not self-evident to them.  This is a big reason abortion is<br>
tolerated.  As to what worked quite well along the voluntary charitable<br>
lines you present, look at the example of the Western Church in the later<br>
Middle Ages.  Nothing has surpassed it yet in this respect.  Taxation was<br>
virtually entirely related to defense and nothing else, and through the<br>
concepts of fealty and homage, taxation was essentially voluntary.<br>
<p>
G47: &lt;&lt;Actually, Africa has a long tradition of free markets and<br>
decentralized power. Recent events are a historical aberration.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;What Africa actually has is a history of ineffectual statecraft, so the<br>
lack of a state made the markets appear free.  In fact, Africa culture is<br>
tribal and strongly communal, so what westerners think of as a free market<br>
and decentralized is not an accurate description.&gt;<br>
<p>
Thank you for correcting this bit of historical revisionism.<br>

John Clark wrote 3/7/98: &lt;What somebody does is more important than how<br>
they do it.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is a restatement of tyranny's favorite rationalization for dealing out<br>
mayhem and injustice.  The original is "the ends justify the means."  It is<br>
barbaric in the extreme.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;consciousness must access the entire universe, not just 50% of it.&gt;<br>
<p>
JC: &lt;I have no idea where you got that figure but I have a very strong<br>
hunch that everything is digital.&gt;<br>
<p>
John, I have been down to your ontological basement before, to your bits of<br>
information as the foundation of all.  It is false.  Information only<br>
exists when there is a knower and a known.  I assumed you were holding a<br>
harmless religious belief about some "knower" at an ontological level<br>
imbuing bits of substance at the Planck scale, the known, with an<br>
informational status.  You never explicitly made known who the knower was.<br>
<p>
Michael Lorrey wrote 3/7/98: &lt;It is unfortunate that today's mass media<br>
doesn't give us the ability to repeat the success that was the British<br>
colonial era. I daresay that the British in that era did more to spread<br>
civilization than anyone before, or possibly since.&gt;<br>
<p>
Nostalgia for the good ol' pre-politically correct days.  I doubt if your<br>
One World Government, a requirement in order to force legalized abortion on<br>
everyone, will spread civilization.  I think it will spread nihilism and<br>
tyranny.  BTW, the Romans did more to spread civilization and the British<br>
themselves were echoes of that previous civilization.<br>
<p>
ML: &lt;non- citizens are legally seen as 'honorary' citizens under agreements<br>
between governments that establish diplomatic relations. Granting any<br>
rights to the unborn in terms of citizenship is a sticky wicket that it<br>
seems nobody wants to try, as it will create a nightmare of immigration and<br>
extradition situations.&gt;<br>
<p>
Interesting food for thought.<br>
<p>
Mark Miloscia wrote 3/7/98: &lt;Having obligations (family, social groups,<br>
community, state, nation, foreigners, etc.), doesn't make one a slave, it<br>
make one responsible.&gt;<br>
<p>
It seems difficult to believe that such a basic truth has to be articulated<br>
in this day and age.  And without responsibilities, rights lose any<br>
meaning, becoming mere idle wishes and animal desires.<br>
<p>
Anton Sherwood wrote about Ian Goddard's holistic claims 3/7/98: &lt;if I read<br>
Brian right, he objects not to your *choice* of primal truth, but to your<br>
claim of priority for one end of the axis - it doesn't matter which end. <br>
As for me, I think you confuse description... with identity.&gt;<br>
<p>
I think you've pegged this correctly.  Neither end has priority, both are<br>
needed in conjunction for existence.  The parallel to my assertion that<br>
nothing purely digital (or binary) can have conscious existence, is that<br>
priority cannot be given only to digital (or what Mr. Goddard calls<br>
atomism), but must be given to holism and atomism equally, and equally in<br>
the form of their conjunction.  Confusing description with identity is what<br>
I mean by "reality exceeds our semantic grasp."<br>
<p>
Anton Sherwood wrote 3/6/98: &lt;Relations between a mother and a fetus are<br>
nonconsensual because the latter is incapable of consent - that's obvious. <br>
But why is this more legitimately a political matter than our relations<br>
with cats, or potted plants?  (Or would you grant them political protection<br>
too?)&gt;<br>
<p>
As I said, our relations with cats (animal rights) has been cast as a<br>
political question for hundreds of years.  Potted plants, I don't know, you<br>
might ask Prince Charles about this, he talks directly to the source.  I<br>
know there are a lot of tree-huggers in the Northwest, many of whom would<br>
prefer to see an unborn child murdered than a 300-yr old Douglas Fir<br>
chopped down to make toilet paper.<br>
<p>
AS: &lt;Well, you know, machines in the real world are analog, just highly<br>
nonlinear.  Now would you mind addressing the issue, rather than derailing<br>
it with analog-chauvinism?&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't mean to be chauvinistic, I just don't see that anything purely<br>
digital can access the spatial, wave form of reality, the microcausal<br>
backward-in-time portion (transactional QM interpretation) or pilot wave<br>
(ontological QM interpretation) in the way consciousness does.  The<br>
coordination dynamics of machines are, in fact, essentially the same as the<br>
coordination dynamics of our own motor actions.  But they are not similar<br>
in intentionality, in altering purposes from within the spatial, wave form<br>
of reality.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;the Constitition said slaves were only counted as 3/5 of a person,<br>
less than fully human.&gt;<br>
<p>
AS: &lt;Oh, please - get it right.  Seats in the House of Representatives are<br>
apportioned according to the population of each State, counting a slave as<br>
3/5 of a free resident.&gt;<br>
<p>
I did get it right.  They were constitutionally less than fully human. <br>
Then, after the Civil War, they were constitutionally, hey presto! fully<br>
human.  Purely a matter of defining human, just as the abortion matter is.<br>
<p>
AS: &lt;What you really mean, I assume, is that you're offended that others<br>
draw the boundary more narrowly than you do, in one respect.  I'm similarly<br>
offended that you exclude most AIs.&gt;<br>
<p>
I'm appalled at the on-going holocaust, the slaughter of the innocents.  It<br>
is not right.  What is illicit cannot be made licit by definitional sleight<br>
of hand.<br>
<p>
AS: &lt;I find genetics a piss-poor criterion for personhood.  Unfortunately,<br>
any objective criterion I can think of (e.g. the Turing Test) is fuzzy, and<br>
the right to life is binary.&gt;<br>
<p>
I have never claimed that genetics is a criterion for personhood.  The<br>
moment the self begins to develop is what defines human.  The right to life<br>
is binary, this is a useful phrase, thus we have big fights over it instead<br>
of compromises.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;If it is legitimate for the strong to prey upon the weak, sooner or<br>
later, we will end up, not as a society, but as isolated systems of<br>
perfected self-defense staring at each other across no-man's land.&gt;<br>
<p>
AS: &lt;This resembles Ayn Rand's argument against polycentric law.  Might<br>
does make right, but there are many kinds of might, and some of the most<br>
important are impersonal - the laws of nature itself.  Ability to attract<br>
the sympathy of the strong is also a kind of might.&gt;<br>
<p>
Interesting observation about Rand, I hadn't thought of it that way.  I<br>
like what Pascal said, might makes right so let's make sure the mighty are<br>
right.  Ability to attract sympathy is important, another way of saying<br>
this is that fraternity and equality are utterly imcompatible ideals. <br>
Fraternity must trump equality for society to avoid the isolated systems<br>
result.  Polycentrism is closer to fraternity than to equality.<br>
<p>
AS: &lt;It's not that I "cannot begin to understand" your position on<br>
abortion; I believe I understand it, but I also believe it's based on<br>
either an error of fact or an arational preference - in either case, not<br>
binding on anyone else.&gt;<br>
<p>
The Supreme Court's arational preference or error of fact is binding on all<br>
those who define human the way I have.  It is tyranny of a most brutal<br>
kind.<br>
<p>
AS: &lt;A number of time travel stories touch on the tragedy of erasing<br>
someone (a child, a lover, a hero) from history by preventing their<br>
conception.  Whether that amounts to murder is an interesting question.&gt;<br>
<p>
Time travel is ridiculous.  The staggering number of murders occurring here<br>
and now is what's interesting.<br>
<p>
John Clark wrote 3/6/98:<br>
RJ: &lt;If we desensitize our population through education and popular<br>
culture, we can do anything we want.&gt;<br>
<p>
JC: &lt;Great, then let's do it!&gt;<br>
<p>
This is self-evident barbarism on the tyrannical side of the political<br>
spectrum, the ordered realm.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;encouraging the entropic view of them as "meat machines."&gt;<br>
<p>
JC: &lt;There is nothing entropic about the truth; we are meat machines.&gt;<br>
<p>
Machines have no rights, machines may interact in a dumb physical way with<br>
each other, but they do not have relations between subjective "I's" in any<br>
sense.  This is an entropic death-worshipping worldview, no humanity is<br>
contained in it whatsoever.  It is self-fabricated license to murder and<br>
send humans to chop shops.  Again, the premise is inherent in totalitarian<br>
regimes, the ordered realm of despots and tyrants.  Any abhorrent action at<br>
all can be and has been rationalized away with "meat machine" as the<br>
central premise of human life.<br>
<p>
JC: &lt;Like nearly  all of the really important things in life I have no<br>
definition for the word "evil", however, if the word has any meaning at all<br>
then those who oppose assisted suicide are evil. Making a person live who<br>
wants to die is as horrendous as making a person die who wants to live,<br>
both are saying that my life is not my own and they can decide my fate,<br>
it's the moral equivalent of murder. Such dangerous monsters should not be<br>
ghettoized, they should be guillotined.&gt;<br>
<p>
But John, you are all for late term abortion, you support murder.  Your<br>
embrace of the culture of death blinds you to the fact that assisted<br>
suicide is licensing doctors to murder developing selves of a greater age<br>
than the unborn.  Individuals can die on their own, they just need to wait,<br>
no one is stopping them by not granting doctors a license to murder.  The<br>
whole culture of death is all about the privileged place murder has in<br>
society.  In Oregon, the logic of the statist establishment of<br>
death-worshipping as the official religion means that my tax dollars are<br>
now being reallocated to the poor so they can pay a doctor to murder them<br>
on demand.  I am soiled by this and have no effective recourse except to<br>
move.  I will not move, this is my home, I take my stand here because the<br>
culture of death, through the logic of globalism will be imposed everywhere<br>
just as soon as they can get away with it.  There's no place to run.<br>
<p>
When you declare that it is a moral imperative to guillotine opponents to<br>
the culture of death, at least you've dropped that "non-coercion" palaver<br>
that so many others who share your worldview pretend to.  "Non-coercion"<br>
often serves as cover for the purpose of duping what's left of civil<br>
society, while doing as you please willfully heedless of the negative<br>
consequences within society of your actions.  This intentional ignorance of<br>
secondary consequences is what the philosopher David Stove called "autism"<br>
in a quote I posted last March: "...No ideal could be more destructive of<br>
human life than the ideal of non-coerciveness.  [The only way] of producing<br>
a non-coercive human being is to produce an autistic one."  It is clear<br>
that amongst competing irreconcilable worldviews that someone is going to<br>
be coerced, to try to pretend otherwise is inellectually dishonest or lazy.<br>
 48% of Oregon voters, including me, voted against doctor-assisted suicide,<br>
aka, licensing doctors to murder.  You'd better crank up your guillotine,<br>
because you have a lot of work "cut" out for you.  To you, of course,<br>
you're just pitting one machine against another, a "meat machine." <br>
Guillotining half my state to you is no different than unplugging a<br>
toaster.<br>
<p>
Albert Camus accurately described the nature of society when purpose and<br>
its derivative, values, are absent.  Values are absent in the worldview of<br>
scientific nihilism which denies the presence of purpose in the universe,<br>
and they are absent in John's "everything is digital" universe because raw<br>
values (unmeasured) are not digital.  This quote is from "The Rebel":  "if<br>
we can assert no value whatsoever, everything is permissible and nothing is<br>
important.  There is no pro or con; the murderer is neither right nor<br>
wrong.  One is free to stoke the crematory fires, or to give one's life to<br>
the care of lepers.  Wickedness and virtue are just accident or whim.  We<br>
may then decide not to act at all, which comes down to condoning other<br>
people's murder, plus a little fastidious sorrow over human imperfection. <br>
Or we may hit upon tragic dilettantism as a substitute for action; in this<br>
case, human lives become counters in a game.  Finally, we may resolve to<br>
undertake some action that is not wholly arbitrary.  In this case, since we<br>
have no higher value to direct our action, we shall aim at efficiency. <br>
Since nothing is true or false, good or bad, our principle will become that<br>
of showing ourselves to be the most effective, in other words the most<br>
powerful.  And then the world will no longer be divided into the just and<br>
the unjust, but into masters and slaves.  Thus, whichever way we turn in<br>
the depths of negation and nihilism, murder has its privileged position." <br>
Thus, the digital and the human-as-information-processing-machine worldview<br>
wends it way over to the guillotine sooner or later.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;Are you saying that the possession of intelligence is the source of<br>
rights?&gt;<br>
<p>
JC: &lt;Yes.&gt;<br>
             <br>
RJ: &lt;And who determines whether ability is there or not, at what threshold<br>
of ability?&gt;<br>
<p>
JC: &lt;The same person who told you that abortion must be outlawed. The same<br>
person who told you that a baby born without a brain and doomed to die<br>
before his second birthday, or a adult in a deep coma for 20 years has more<br>
rights than a happy healthy chimpanzee.&gt;<br>
<p>
But, who is that?  I don't get it.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;What's wrong with commercializing all life, at all stages of<br>
development, including humans, intelligent or otherwise, conscious or<br>
otherwise?&gt;<br>
<p>
JC: &lt;Nothing.&gt;<br>
<p>
Slaves were property, you are promoting the return of slavery here. <br>
Slavery and abortion really are the same issue of defining human.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;Just make all life into products in the marketplace, all custom<br>
designed for any use whatsoever?&gt;<br>
<p>
JC: &lt;If we did that there would be less misery in the world. Child abuse<br>
would drop dramatically, those who love their children would still do so<br>
and those who don't would nevertheless have reason to treat them well<br>
because you don't deliberately damage an asset that has value.&gt;<br>
<p>
But John, in this barbarian nihilistic world, twisted "meat machines" find<br>
the value in an asset (that is, child) to be in the abuse and destruction<br>
itself.  There are always plenty more where that one came from, they're<br>
only machines (products) after all.  Once you're purchased a product you<br>
can do whatever you wish with it, you could practice your guillotining<br>
skills on babies, children, whatever product you desired.  This goes<br>
against the grain of the core ethics of Western Civilization that have<br>
worked well for centuries on end, namely, humans are not to be used as<br>
means because they are ends in themselves.  This would not produce less<br>
misery, only tyranny of the most brutal kind.<br>
