You're right they are rare, there must be more but just off the top of my <br>
head I can only think of two, one of course is 2001, the other is a wonderful <br>
comedy made by Albert Brooks about 5 years ago called "Defending your life". <br>
It's a fantasy comedy not science fiction, but it does have a lot of  <br>
Extropian ideas in it and they're very strongly stated, such as " the point <br>
of eternal life is to keep getting smarter", that's not an exact quote but <br>
it's close, it's also a very funny movie. Incidentally Albert Brooks changed <br>
his name, he thought his real name was hard to live up to and not good for a <br>
comedian, his real name is Albert Einstein.<br>
