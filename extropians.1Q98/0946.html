<p>
Probably because that's true, that's why. (Moreover, 'out of control' is<br>
such a vague term that you can lump a gadzillion issues under this<br>
label. If you think of it, a lot of things are 'out of control'. My<br>
shoelaces, for example). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; difficult to control? For some of the problems you identify, explore</i><br>
<p>
Technology is impossible to control, for it would require concerted action<br>
of a large, heterogenous agent population (the probabilistic argument). <br>
Also, a subpopulation treading the hitech path tends to have higher<br>
fitness (military prowess, can better memefect due to its better media).<br>
On the short to medium run technology promises excellent ROI. (Of course,<br>
on the long run technology can be terminal to Life As We Know It). <br>
<p>
In other words, technology is good.<br>
