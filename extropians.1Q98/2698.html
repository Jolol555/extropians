<a href="http://www.jsb.com">http://www.jsb.com</a>  The stand alone browser app JSB has licensed to WYSE. JSB packages it as<br>
part of their AlphaWindows office package.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; extropians, we need to get the anti-change meme out of our systems through regular,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; habitual purging of obsolete techniques, tools, etc. from our regular use.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I entirely agree. However, I really don't think that plain-vanilla ascii email is</i><br>
<i>&gt; "obsolete", and I'm not really sure why HTML is so vastly superior.  All I've seen so</i><br>
<i>&gt; far is the ability to change fonts and colours. Woopee doo is my reaction to that.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; in no was changes the -content-, merely the presentation.  We're still reading text,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's just text prettified up slightly.</i><br>
<p>
At this point. Much more interesting stuff is possible. For those of you who have browsers<br>
that are 'shocked', check out:<br>

This guy is really on the edge. He is the new standard we should all shoot for for web<br>
content....IMNSHO<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with what you are saying in principle, it's just that I don't think it applies</i><br>
<i>&gt; to email. If even one member of the list cannot read HTML, why should the rest of us</i><br>
<i>&gt; exclude this person, when it really serves no valid purpose? Is the ability to mix and</i><br>
<i>&gt; match fonts going to make the list more useful than the opinions/thoughts/rants/agitprop</i><br>
<i>&gt; of that individual?  I doubt it, although suffering through the interminable abortion</i><br>
<i>&gt; thread makes me doubt this conclusion.</i><br>
<p>
Flip it. Why should the rest of us who are moving ahead be held back by the stubborn<br>
intransigence of those opposed to progress? This list is for forward thinkers.<br>
