Finally!  Someone recognizes me in this thread!<br>

<p>
My point is that if things get that far, there is probably no hope for the child<br>
anyway.  Some corporal punishment might avoid him from doing it in front<br>
of his parents again, but the child has already demonstrated he has little<br>
value for life and is willing to lash out at innocents.  My question: since most<br>
kids don't do this sort of thing, why did he?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I also believe that parents should have broad discretion regarding how </i><br>

<i>&gt;are paying the bills! If that includes an occasional whack on the butt, </i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not going to interfere. </i><br>
<p>
I never claimed I'd interfere.  There is a difference between believing<br>
something is wrong and believing it should be forcibly prohibited.  I<br>
often think wholesale slaughter of politicians is wrong, yet I doubt I<br>
would lift a finger to stop it.  (OK, I would cheer it on!:)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Also, when I was hit, I never thought I was wrong, I just thought I needed</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to get even.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, were you wrong? If so, I guess being hit was not effective. When I </i><br>
<i>&gt;got belted, it was always for a good reason and it impressed on me (pun </i><br>
<i>&gt;intended) the fact that if I misbehaved there would be unpleasant </i><br>
<i>&gt;consequences. </i><br>
<p>
At least your parents were consistent then.  My own experience, and not<br>
mine alone (I also mean seeing how other abusive parents behaved) was<br>
that punishment was inflicted for any number of reasons and almost never<br>
fit the crime in its intensity and duration.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; In the example that Mark D. Fulwiler used, of a kid kicking a cat into</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; unconsciousness, we should ask Why did the kid think this would</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "work" as a solution to not getting his way?  I think it is because the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; kid was spoiled already.  I've noticed that parents who abuse tend</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; also to spoil.  They go through cycles of heavy abuse and spoiling</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; permissiveness, often because they feel guilty about the abuse.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The child then grows up with unreal expectations -- he or she does</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; not know if any encounter will be injurious or indulgent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, maybe. However, there are excellent parents who sometimes have </i><br>
<i>&gt;problem children despite their best efforts. I would be interested in </i><br>
<i>&gt;why the kid kicked the cat, but wouldn't you agree that the kid should </i><br>
<i>&gt;get some punishment (and a severe one at that) for this really vile act? </i><br>
<p>
I agree here.  Of course, something should befall the child.  I just hate to<br>
see these things brought up as isolated incidents.  Sometimes, parents<br>
do have a problem child and only massive intervention might ever change<br>
that, but I feel in most cases this is not so.  I think the family is the<br>
training<br>
ground for how the child deals with the rest of the world and life.  Ergo,<br>
that's why I ask why that child would do what he did.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Shouldn't actions have consequences? If not, I'm afraid this awful </i><br>
<i>&gt;little kid may be in Juvenile Hall at age 14 for murder.</i><br>
<p>
Do you really think a few beatings from now 'til then will change his<br>
path in life?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I believe a few books have been written on these phenomena.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you can cite one, I'd appreciate it.</i><br>
<p>
The one that first comes to my mind is Mazlish and Faber's _How to Talk<br>
so Kid's will Listen and How to Listen so Kid's will talk_ (or is it vice<br>
versa?).  It proved helpful in my life.<br>
<p>
Anyway, would you be willing to admit there must be some limits on the<br>
ways and intensities of force used by parents?  I'd hate to see someone<br>
say, "Hitting is okay, therefore the next time Junior steals a strawberry<br>
from the fridge, I'm going to beat him into a coma."<br>
