I doubt that efficient tiny reactors can be built. There are two<br>
possibilities, one being cold fusion (which seems to be doubtful at the<br>
moment) and the other is based on sonoluminescence (SL). SL is still a<br>
macroscopic process but I could imagine a SL reactor in the kilogram<br>
size range.<br>
<p>
OTOH, using nanotech for waste disposal, including body waste, for full<br>
oxidation would provide quite a bit of energy and keep the campsite<br>
clean too. The tent could be made of a kind of diamondoid foam with<br>
vacuum within the foam (like a super aerogel) giving the tent a<br>
reasonable R value (15 or so) so staying warm in the tent would be easy.<br>
The nano could also collect the evaporated water (and its heat of<br>
condensation stays in the tent). Going nuclear seems a bit excessive for<br>
this app which has many non nuke solutions.<br>

<i>&gt; the fusion reactor. Most of atoms will eventually transform to stable</i><br>
<i>&gt; isotopes under additional exposure to fast neutrons.</i><br>
<p>
Well, at least the early verions of nano will only be able to<br>
distinguish elements, not isotopes. Also, any nano working with<br>
radioactive elements is subject to considerable damage. As for neutrons,<br>
well, they are oblivious to nanotech, and will happily wander through<br>
all kinds of matter. I surely wouldn't want a neutron emitting fusion<br>
reactor in my tent!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The tiny percentage</i><br>
<i>&gt; that do not can be separated (again by nanotech)</i><br>
<p>
So, how do you catch these anyway??<br>
<p>
 and deactivated in a<br>
<i>&gt; tiny</i><br>
<i>&gt; particle accellerator.</i><br>
<p>
Even nano accelerators will not be very efficient.<br>
