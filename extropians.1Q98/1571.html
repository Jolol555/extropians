         <br>
<p>
True, and equally true is the fact that the data in a computer's memory that <br>
a photo cell has received a photon of 700 nm light is nothing like that light. <br>
I don't know if that data is anything like my idea of red, and I don't know <br>
if your red is the same as mine either.<br>

          <br>
<p>
All bits are abstract whether in a brain or a machine, and if computers  <br>
contained nothing but non unified set of bits they would produce only <br>
gibberish. They don't.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
<p>
To exist information must be in a context, otherwise a hole in a paper tape <br>
is not data it's just a hole, but there is nothing unique about the human <br>
mind in that regard.<br>
<p>
As for Searle's Chinese Room, it only proves one thing, a very small part of <br>
a mechanism does not have all the attributes of the whole.<br>
