This is a problem. I think many adherents to the circuits hide too<br>
much behind "it is just a model" - in science a model must be useful,<br>
i.e. testable/falsifiable, make predictions etc. <br>
<p>
I think it is fairly clear that the first two circuits are on a fairly<br>
solid ground, most theories of personality seem to involve security<br>
vs. exploration and aggression vs. submission factors. And the third<br>
circuit seems almost as well founded. I don't have my textbooks within<br>
reach, but one could probably make a good case for these circuits<br>
being central factors of personality. I don't really grok the fourth<br>
circuit as a whole, but it seems easy to deal with too. The circuit<br>
model just says that these factors are fairly independent aspects of a<br>
working mind, and that they are in general static except during<br>
imprinting. This seems testable.<br>
<p>
The fifth "rapture" circuit is less well understood, but I think it is<br>
fairly clear that these states appear so often in the literature (both<br>
mystical and psychological) that they can be said to be real. They are<br>
however not well understood, and it is by no means clear that they are<br>
all due to the same circuit.<br>
<p>
Mystical experiences may be grouped together, but I'm not sure they<br>
form useful circuits.<br>
<p>
As a neuroscientist I'm interested in the neural correlates of these<br>
circuits. Note that the monoaminergic projections might correlate;<br>
serotonin and the first circuit, noradrenaline and stress hormones the<br>
second, possibly acetylcholine for the third, oxytocine, vassopressin<br>
and others for the fourth, and *maybe* dopamine for the fifth. But now<br>
I'm just guessing and waving my hands :-)<br>
