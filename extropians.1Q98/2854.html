<i>&gt;&gt; "My socialist buddies in China"? I don't know anyone there except one</i><br>
fellow<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; who asked me if he could have the source code of my text2html converter.</i><br>
The<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; description 'socialist' hardly fits here, though. It's a capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; dictatorship with a red flag.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;So it isn't free enterprise, right? Its an oligopoly. They claim to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;socialists as a general matter of propaganda, but so did the communists...</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nothing is really different with the minor exception that they don't shoot</i><br>
<i>&gt;foreign reporters as spies anymore.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Free enterprise in the way you define it cannot exist. When liberating an<br>
economy, existing economic power structures will try to manifestate their<br>
powers in other forms of government or the same form as before, because they<br>
need a tool to exploit the majority of the population. One of the other<br>
forms of government is a dictatorship like that in China.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Freedom, in the words of a former US President, is "The right to choose</i><br>
between<br>
<i>&gt;working and starving."</i><br>
<p>
Not even this very castrated form of freedom always exists in a "free<br>
market". Take a look at Germany, about 5 million people, if you believe the<br>
government statistics, are without work. If you don't believe them and do<br>
more precise calculations which implement temporary government work<br>
measures, you get about 7 millions. The US employment statistics often work<br>
with the number of jobs, not the number of employees. You got a poverty rate<br>
of 15 %, and 20 % for youths. Your president cuts new holes into the social<br>
"net" each year in order to assure that freedom is really only the freedom<br>
to choose between working and living badly and starving. Sometimes, you<br>
should take look at the real world, besides your great leisure activities<br>
and high income.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Take Cuba for example. Its economy is now open to most of Europe and</i><br>
Canada, and<br>
<i>&gt;all the rest of the world who doesn't necessarily cowtow to US policies.</i><br>
Yet it<br>
<i>&gt;is still a shithole. The claims of high life expectancy are totally false,</i><br>
as<br>
<i>&gt;the government continues to repress and mismanage the economy which is now</i><br>
<i>&gt;dollar driven, not peso driven, and malnutirtion is still rampant, as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;pathetic agricultural sector has all but collapsed (with absolutely no help</i><br>
or<br>
<i>&gt;hindrance from the US), for it is still centrally driven by a bureaucracy</i><br>
that<br>
<i>&gt;still thinks along the lines of producing the maximum amount of sugar for</i><br>
export<br>
<i>&gt;to a now non-existent Soviet Union.</i><br>
<p>
Cuba, besides Chile, is still one of the healthiest nations in Latin<br>
America. I have posted statistics on this before, but you have rejected them<br>
because they were obviously from too "liberal" sources (United Nations and<br>
such). By saying that something is "totally false", however, and thereby<br>
making yourself the source for your claims, you don't do much to refute my<br>
statements. Actually, you, John Clark and others have not posted a single<br>
source, a single document to support your claims. True believers, as John<br>
said (referring to me).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The best definition of freedom probably comes from the</i><br>
anarcho-socialists.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Not being oppressed by power structures while, at the same time, helping</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; advance evolution. Such a freedom is entirely impossible in a "free</i><br>
market".<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Evolution of what? And how?</i><br>
<p>
Evolution of humanity. Through progress. By spreading information.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You cannot create change without force and the use</i><br>
<i>&gt;of power. Human nature is wired against change, for the most part.</i><br>
<p>
Your main problem is that you don't have much fantasy. Your worldview is<br>
much too limited. I have said it about 283475 times: You can only advance<br>
evolution if you bring the necessary information to those who are "in<br>
command" or will be someday. It's absolutely irrelevant whether these people<br>
are economic or political leaders, it's just important that they have the<br>
power to change things and the intelligence to understand what you tell<br>
them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;ROTFL to you. Having 30% of the population in slavery is NOT 'more social</i><br>
and<br>
<i>&gt;economic freedom' (although to an avowed socialist, I can see why one might</i><br>
<i>&gt;think so).</i><br>
<p>
You're talking about the time of the Republic. This time was, in some ways,<br>
as bad as the Dark Ages. But there was much slavery in the Middle Ages, too.<br>
<p>
And in the Empire, conditions for slaves got much better. Tiberius made<br>
slave participation in arena battles with wild animals dependant on<br>
permision by the authorities. Claudius equated the killing of weak or sick<br>
slaves to murder. Domitian disallowed to castrate slaves in order to sell<br>
them as eunuchs. Hadrian prohibited selling slaves to brothels. Diocletia<br>
put the abandonment of slave children under punishment. [1] It was not even<br>
allowed to take slaves from within the empire.<br>
<p>
It was still slavery, but the Middle Ages were much worse. When you were a<br>
slave of a land-owner there, you didn't have any rights. Life or death<br>
didn't matter to the slightest degree. If you're a slave to a major bank<br>
today, your situation is not much better either. Or you work in a privatized<br>
prison. Possibly for taking drugs -- I know that you would like to remove<br>
such legislation, but as a matter of fact, it exists.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The Roman ships were decidedly NOT better built than the Caravels and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Galleons of the Middle ages, or of even the Viking ships. A Roman boat was</i><br>
<i>&gt;barely able to navigate the Mediterranean, and piracy was a scourge</i><br>
throughout<br>
<i>&gt;the empire that little was done to suppress, as pirates provided the main</i><br>
slave<br>
<i>&gt;supply.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
This is utter nonsense.<br>
<p>
Pirates: Not in the Empire. Caesar and Pompeiius eliminated them completely.<br>
<p>
Ships: One of the largest Roman wheat cargo ships, the "ISIS", had a tonnage<br>
of 1200 tons. The largest known Middle Ages ship had a tonnage of 150 tons.<br>
The big Roman harbours had restrictions that disallowed the entry of ships<br>
under a tonnage of 150 tons. That means that the largest MA ship wasn't even<br>
big enough to dock at a major Roman harbour. Actually, you managed to build<br>
in more than one mistake into each sentence. Great effort!<br>
<p>
The numbers above are from memory. We (meaning an expert on the subject and<br>
myself) will put up a temporary page about the Roman ships on my homepage.<br>
There's already a Rome page at <a href="http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/rome">http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/rome</a>, it deals<br>
mainly with Roman harnessing, which was, contrary to claims by famous MA<br>
researchers, not inferior to the MA, but actually superior.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the empire, 'bread and cicuses' were the only thing that kept the plebes</i><br>
in<br>
<i>&gt;check from revolting against the government.</i><br>
<p>
Utter nonsense, too. This started only with the decline of the Empire.<br>
"Bread and circuses" were, in the beginning, more a recruitment mass media<br>
for the legion. Later, the population was held under control with<br>
religion -- that's why the Jesus story was created. Indeed, the tax<br>
structure led to the impoverishment of the majority of the population. These<br>
taxes were not really used for investments by the state -- it was just like<br>
today: A small minority exploited the majority.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;On the contrary, the Church was the only thing that preserved the knowledge</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt;the Romans.</i><br>
<p>
99 % of all books and important information from the Empire were destroyed<br>
later. Of the aquaeducts, they built houses and bridges. Of the chalk<br>
remains in them, they built altars. The Roman water tanks were more<br>
impressive than any MA cathedral. If we would get another decline like this<br>
today, that would mean building habitats out of cars, altars of computers.<br>
Really clever guys, your MA "buddies".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While the Empire was stagnant, the middle ages was not caused by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the church, but by the pillaging and destruction of the Mongol Hordes, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Viking incursions, and the general migratory habits of the various tribes</i><br>
of<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;'barbarians' such as the Vandals, the Visigoths, the Angles, the Franks,</i><br>
etc.<br>
<p>
<p>
Without the money concentration that occurred in the empire, they would have<br>
had no problems in assimilating these tribes. They have managed to defeat<br>
stronger enemies than these. The Middle Ages were caused by the hierarchical<br>
religous mysticism that followed the Roman Empire. Millions of pagans were<br>
murdered after the downfall of Rome. Millions were killed in the crusades,<br>
too. Because they didn't manage the logicistics, they even had to eat their<br>
enemies on the way. And because of the same failure, the crusader state was<br>
lost. Stupidity is not a good prerequisite for a war.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And who is gonna do that distributing, you?</i><br>
<p>
Some intelligent, educated individuals who have the power to do so. Doesn't<br>
matter if it's me or you. It just has to be done, that's all. As long as the<br>
Roman emperors did some kind of correct redistribution through just tax<br>
systems, everything worked fine. But then, the minority had to pay less and<br>
less, the majority more and more, and everything collapsed. Pyramid systems<br>
don't hold very long.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sorry, in order for the transhuman to become reality, it is gonna take</i><br>
individuals who amass sufficient wealth to<br>
<i>&gt;pay for the research for themselves, for the operations on themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Redistributing hard earned wealth to people who didnt earn it is driving us</i><br>
down<br>
<i>&gt;the same 'bread and cicuses' path that the Roman Empire took.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You and your definitions. Here you say that a transhuman is not reality yet.<br>
In the next paragraph:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Oh, so you are a spiritualist. Sorry, wrong list for you. A Transhuman is</i><br>
an<br>
<i>&gt;individual who decides to and undertakes the individual work necessary to</i><br>
move<br>
<i>&gt;beyond the common human state. There are already such transhumans around,</i><br>
and<br>
<i>&gt;most don't know that the label applies to them. People like Hawking,</i><br>
Freidman,<br>
<i>&gt;Dyson, Feynman, etc.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, so transhumans already exist.<br>
<p>
You see, there was a reason why we decided to call "Homo Excelsior" "The<br>
Transhumanist's Magazine". A transhumanist is someone who strives to become<br>
transhuman. A transhuman is someone who has managed to transcend human<br>
conditions. A posthuman is someone whose conditions are so entirely<br>
different from that of a biological human or transhuman that it cannot<br>
really be called human anymore. Are these definitions OK for you?<br>
<p>
But for the content of the first paragraph: It doesn't really matter who<br>
pays for it. If you have an economy based on money, you need people who have<br>
wealth, right, but this wealth doesn't need to be accumulated. It can be<br>
pooled by people with the same interests -- this doesn't contradict with<br>
equal distribution of wealth. Redistributing the "hard earned" (you? earning<br>
your money hard? hardly.) money to people who didn't "earn" it avoids<br>
driving us down the money concentration path the Roman Empire took.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is no fixed 'goalpost' to define a human vs. transhuman state.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, first, they don't exist. Then they do. Then, nobody can say. You're a<br>
bit moody, wouldn't you say?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The human race 100 years from now will consist mostly of people who we</i><br>
would today regard<br>
<i>&gt;as 'transhumans', but they  would merely regard as 'human'. We would be</i><br>
seen as<br>
<i>&gt;barbarians.</i><br>
<p>
More you than me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; That's the failure, you know. The Americans didn't become a superpower</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; because they were so clever. They've earned a golden nose with both World</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Wars, whereas the British Empire was eliminated as a superpower already</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; after WW I. The German economy didn't fare so well after WW II because</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; politicians were so intelligent, but because it was greatly funded by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; US.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Which, you must admit, is a far far different thing than winning a war,</i><br>
n'est<br>
<i>&gt;pas? When ever in human history has a victor so completely rebuilt a former</i><br>
<i>&gt;enemy (nay, three former enemies, Germany, Italy, and Japan) so that they</i><br>
become<br>
<i>&gt;less than 40 years after the war, economic rivals once again? This is the</i><br>
genius<br>
<i>&gt;of the generosity and magnanimity of what you call 'selfish, greedy,</i><br>
capitalist<br>
<i>&gt;Amerika'. Winning a mere war was not the trick. Winning the peace was.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You aren't employed by the NSA propaganda section, are you? You should write<br>
reports about the gulf war, too.<br>
<p>
Of course, it was the same selfish attitude that made the Americans fund the<br>
biggest losers of the war that made them also fund the two wars themselves.<br>
Any credits given by the US to Japan and Germany could not be paid back in<br>
hard currency, because these countries were practically ruined. That's why<br>
they were paid in naturals. Buildings, companies, the whole infrastructure.<br>
But what's this worth if the country is ruined? But if it gets big again, it<br>
can earn you lots of money. Which was why it happened. Another crackpot<br>
theory? Sure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; History could also look completely different, if, after WW I, Germany had</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; decided to cooperate with Russia. Such a plan was made, by Weimar state</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; secretary Rathenau. Remember the contract of Rapallo? It allowed the</i><br>
Germans<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to quit reparation payments and to build and test weapons in the SU.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately (probably), Rathenau was assassinated in 1922.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;All that would have meant would be that the US would have come into the war</i><br>
<i>&gt;earlier on the side of Britain, and when we won, we would have also been</i><br>
able to<br>
<i>&gt;get the damn Soviet Union out of the way then rather than 50 years later.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, there would have been no war. *If* there would have been a war in<br>
Europe, it would not have lasted long. (Germany and the Soviet Union<br>
combined, without the stupidity of Hitler and his followers -- good night).<br>
Actually, the power would probably be much more distributed: Still a British<br>
empire, a powerful Soviet Union, a rising Germany and an increasingly less<br>
relevant America.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, Lee Harvey Oswald was assassinated two days later.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Who was saying something about crackpots..?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No comment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So you admit that cultural evolution is "a long row of bad coincidences,</i><br>
<i>&gt;backstabbings, and battle for power"? If this is so, why do you say that</i><br>
"power<br>
<i>&gt;structures need to end" for human evolution to occur?</i><br>
<p>
When did I say that power structures need to end? That's just your wild<br>
interpretation, because you would like to stamp me as a socialist or crazy<br>
anarchist or something like this. As an Extropian, you need to make reality<br>
as simple as possible in order to avoid stumbling over contradictions in<br>
your worldview.<br>
