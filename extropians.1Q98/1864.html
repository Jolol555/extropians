I must admit to being a little surprised, I was sure someone would<br>
mention last nights X-files episode.<br>
<p>
Co-written by William Gibson, the story revolved around an AI that<br>
had been released onto the net to evolve, when it no longer<br>
responded to it's creators summons, they try to track it down and<br>
incapacitate it.<br>
<p>
 It reacts predictably by defending itself, sometimes in an<br>
ingenious fashion, sometimes in a more predictable way.<br>
<p>
The lead character was a women (INVISIGOTH) who I would class as<br>
definitely extropian, she was reputed to have a PHD in AI, was<br>
extremely streetsmart, and in the words of one of the lone gunman,<br>
she was hot!<br>
<p>
 She reveals to the agents that her and her lover were planning on<br>
uploading themselves onto the net, but he has disappeared while<br>
searching for the home node of the AI.<br>
<p>
I don't want to spoil the rest, but if you didn't see it, call your<br>
friends and look for a tape.......<br>
