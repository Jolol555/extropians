I believe that due to time being  relative the effect of the space <br>
expanding infront of the light beam is cancled out but the relative <br>
change in time dialation.<br>
<p>
E.G. The object sending out the light wave can not be traleving away <br>
from us at a speed higher than the speed of light no matter of how <br>
far away it is!  Therefor the light will allways reach us.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; It may be that the universe expansion is worse than I thought.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Consider that the computer must, as time goes on, be composed more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and more of empty space, since the density of space is decreasing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (exponentially?).  We must signal from one side to the other by sending</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; something that takes energy, whether gravitational radiation, photons,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or particles.  Suppose we send a particle.  The problem may be that if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; give the particle too small an initial speed, that it never gets there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It loses ground due to the universe expanding out from under it, and at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; some point it actually starts to go backwards.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I had a similar thought the other day.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I started out with the following idea. Suppose we construct probes </i><br>
<i>&gt; that fly out in all directions, and when they reach a lump of matter, </i><br>
<i>&gt; they use some of the energy it contains to shoot fragments back to </i><br>
<i>&gt; origo (Earth). Some fragments have to fly in the opposite direction </i><br>
<i>&gt; to conserve total  momentum, but there should be a constant fraction </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the energy in a lump of matter that we can send back to origo at a </i><br>
<i>&gt; certain speed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As the colonization wave spreads, the frontier surface that they </i><br>
<i>&gt; harvest matter from increases as the square of the radius of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; colonization bubble. My idea was that even if the average density of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the universe decreases over time as a result of expansion, this </i><br>
<i>&gt; decrease might slow enough so that amount of matter that </i><br>
<i>&gt; could be sent back to origo at any moment would diverge as t goes to </i><br>
<i>&gt; infinity. This could allow an infinity of computations at origo.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I did some back of the envelope calculations. I think the expansion </i><br>
<i>&gt; rate of the universe (if it is open) will asymptotically approach a </i><br>
<i>&gt; constant (could anybody confirm this?). So the density of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; universe would decrease as t^3, for large values of t, and the volume </i><br>
<i>&gt; from of the space where we can have harvested a constant fraction of </i><br>
<i>&gt; its matter content grows as t^3 (if the probes have constant speed </i><br>
<i>&gt; ans since the volume of a sphere is proportional to R^3). So far, </i><br>
<i>&gt; things look bright.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But then I thought of this problem. Suppose the probes travel with </i><br>
<i>&gt; the speed v. Then there must be some distance d such that if the </i><br>
<i>&gt; probes start at that distance, they will never return to origo. For </i><br>
<i>&gt; if d is big enough, then by the time the probes have traveled 10% of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the way, the remaining 90% will have grown larger than the original </i><br>
<i>&gt; 100%, due to the expansion of space inbetween. So if that expansion </i><br>
<i>&gt; rate settles down to a constant, then there must be a sphere centered </i><br>
<i>&gt; around Earth such that nothing that is outside of that sphere can </i><br>
<i>&gt; *ever* affect Earth, even if it travels with the speed of light. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hence the above proposal fails, unless somebody can point to some </i><br>
<i>&gt; mistake in this reasoning.</i><br>
