[Silly anti-capitalist drivel and rebuttal omitted]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Mind you, being a bit of a romantic (former member of the Society for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Creative Anachronism), I confess I do find "High-Tech-Middle Ages"</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather appealing.  Everyone a noble, with machines for peasants; every</i><br>
<i>&gt; noble living in a semiautonomous fief, with banner flying ...</i><br>
<p>
It does seem an interesting phenomenon that many of the most<br>
forward thinkers I know have romantic attachments to particular<br>
anachronisms: Friedman was in the SCA as well.  I have a strange<br>
fondness for bow ties (and not those clip-on monstrosities) and<br>
dry Martinis.  AI have a friend who invests in private space<br>
exploration stocks while driving a restored Studebaker.<br>
<p>
I suppose for some it is just homage to the best of past while<br>
replacing what needs to be replaced, but I think it's more than<br>
that in most cases.  What evolutionary advantage was conferred<br>
upon those of us who invented the concept of "classic" that made<br>
it such a common meme?<br>
