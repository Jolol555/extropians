I suppose I should be equally unsurprised by the lack of reading comprehension<br>
on the list. Let's recap shall we?<br>
<p>
  One of the Dutch subscribers was arguing for welfare and big government,<br>
  and his final pro-welfare argument seemed to come down to 'give the poor<br>
  money or they'll come and take it by force'.<br>
<p>
  My point was simply that if things were really reduced to that level,<br>
  then why did he imagine that the rich would let them do so when they<br>
  could easily afford to defend themselves? If he couldn't come up with<br>
  a better argument than raw force, then welfare was doomed.<br>
<p>
This is nothing new on this list; we've seen many arguments in the past that<br>
the vast majority of people would be worthless to the first post-humans and<br>
would be wiped out. The only difference seems to be that I'm pointing out<br>
that the situation is different today only in scale.<br>
<p>
In any case, what do you intend to do if riots occur? Just sit around and<br>
wait for them to burn your business down? I've seen several photos of <br>
shopkeepers defending their stores with AR-15s during the LA riots. You<br>
think the cops and army wouldn't shoot rioters?<br>
