----------<br>
<i>&gt; From: Anders Sandberg &lt;asa@nada.kth.se&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The last weeks this list has honestly been rather non-extropian and</i><br>
<i>&gt; uninteresting (but loud). I think it is time for each of us to take a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bit of responsibility and try to increase the quality level and</i><br>
<i>&gt; relevance here.</i><br>
<p>
It's more fun to discuss nonsense with interesting (and more or less <br>
like-minded) people than it is to discuss interesting stuff with shallow people.<br>
But I suppose you're right...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Here is a suggestion for something well worth discussing:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How to integrate the various enhancement technologies that interests</i><br>
<i>&gt; us into a working lifestyle? There are lots of useful pieces out</i><br>
<i>&gt; there: caloric restriction, wearable computers, cognitive tools,</i><br>
<i>&gt; nutrient supplements, external tools and useful habits. How to</i><br>
<i>&gt; integrate them into our lives in a flexible manner (we will want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; replace them with better versions later and add more as they appear)</i><br>
<i>&gt; to maximize our potential in the hear-and-now? What strategies work</i><br>
<i>&gt; best, how do we motivate ourselves to change our lives?</i><br>
<p>
Well, here are some ideas:<br>
<p>
First of all, if you haven't done it already, sign up for cryonic suspension.<br>
This is just about *the* most transhuman thing to do right now, not just because<br>
it's a practical solution to a serious problem (death), but also a statement of<br>
personal empowerment and a tangible 'commitment' to transhumanism.<br>
<p>
Also, it might be a good idea to wear miniature cameras and microphones on<br>
your clothing (preferably well hidden) whenever possible, and especially during<br>
important events like signing deals, making bets etc. You never know when<br>
this hard evidence might come in handy.<br>
<p>
When in dangerous areas (like the USA), wear a kevlar vest as often as<br>
possible. It may not be a force field, but it can prevent some nasty injuries.<br>
<p>
Learn some simple street fighting skills, and/or carry mace and a stun gun/<br>
knife. If possible, learn to use and carry a gun.<br>
<p>
Use food supplements like Green Magma (young barley leaf powder that can <br>
best be mixed with fizzy mineral water) with every meal to compensate for<br>
lack of vegetables.<br>
<p>
Smoke MJ every now and then for fun, as an aphrodisiac, and to permanently<br>
enhance critical thinking skills and sensory imput.<br>
<p>
Buy your own tropical island (some are as cheap as $ 50,000) and live <br>
autonomously (or use for vacations). Of course, this is not for everyone.<br>
<p>
Use DHEA and/or carnitine for fat control, muscle buildup without training and<br>
increased fitness (among other things).<br>
<p>
Note: I don't do all the above myself, although I should. Just too damn lazy. Any<br>
tips on how to increase one's motivation?<br>
