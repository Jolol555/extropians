<i>        &gt;Property is whatever you can stop someone else from taking.          </i><br>
            <br>
True, without a doubt.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;They've committed the crime, you lost out, and any "justice" incurred         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;beyond that point is by definition, revenge.</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
You're using private definitions, apparently for you the ASCII string <br>
"revenge" means "justice" and "justice" means "revenge", that's your right,  <br>
one definition is not intrinsically better than another; however, for <br>
effective communication a common definition is useful and that's why I use <br>
the standard one.<br>
<p>
Justice means finding whatever needs to be done to minimize most suffering in <br>
most people. I admit that the best solution is often far from obvious, but at <br>
least the problem is clear. <br>
<p>
Revenge means entertainment obtained by causing pain in somebody else. <br>
<p>
Example:<br>
<p>
I take your banana. When I'm not looking you steal the banana back.<br>
Justice.<br>
<p>
I take your banana. When I'm not looking you steal the banana back, pour <br>
gasoline on me, set me on fire and laugh at my screams of agony as I burn <br>
alive and beg for death.<br>
Revenge.<br>
              <br>
<i>        &gt;It may be bullshit, but it's inspired bullshit</i><br>
<p>
Well, I half agree.<br>
