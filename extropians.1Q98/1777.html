SOMERS, N.Y., (Feb 13) - International Business Machines Corp. said<br>
Friday it signed an $85 million contract to build the world's<br>
fastest supercomputer.<br>
<p>
The computer giant said it won the contract from the U.S.<br>
Department of Energy and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory<br>
located in Livermore, Calif.<br>
<p>
U.S. Secretary of Energy Federico Pena announced the contract<br>
Thursday in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington.<br>
<p>
The IBM RS/6000 SP, the technology behind Deep Blue's successful<br>
challenge of chess grand master Garry Kasparov, will be capable of<br>
10 trillion calculations per second upon its installation at<br>
Livermore in the year 2000.<br>
<p>
The computer, when complete, will be capable of calculating in a<br>
single second what would take 10 million years using a hand-held<br>
calculator.<br>
<p>
The contract, announced under the DOE's Accelerated Strategic<br>
Computing Initiative (ASCI), is the third IBM award in a program<br>
designed to build systems capable of tera-scale (trillion<br>
calculations-per-second) computing,<br>
<p>
HREF="<a href="http://www.rs6000.ibm.com/resource/pressreleases/1998/Feb/d">http://www.rs6000.ibm.com/resource/pressreleases/1998/Feb/d</a><br>
oe.html"&gt; IBM said.<br>
<p>
These systems will enable the DOE to conduct complex modeling and<br>
simulation to ensure the safety and reliability of the nation's<br>
nuclear stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing.<br>
<p>
This new technology will also offer the DOE an eight-fold increase<br>
in simulation detail compared to what is available today.<br>
<p>
''Banks, retailers, insurers, manufacturers, health care, and<br>
communications providers are among the industries that stand to<br>
benefit from technological advances resulting from ASCI,'' the<br>
company said in a statement. <br>
