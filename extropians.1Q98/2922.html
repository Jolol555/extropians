I think Charlie means (and I agree) that increasing the severity of<br>
punishments, as our posturing politicians like to do, is pointless so<br>
long as the robber is confident that punishment is unlikely.  (And<br>
remember that crooks tend to underestimate the likelihood of getting<br>
caught, anyway).  Rather than jacking up the (nominal) length of<br>
sentences and building more prisons for the minority who get caught,<br>
we'd be better off devoting those resources to catching more of the<br>
crooks.<br>
