Me?  Cryptic?  Heh.  Well, to alleviate at least a little bit of mystery, I've<br>
finally posted "The Last Free Place" on the web, available off of my homepage<br>
at: &lt;<a href="http://members.aol.com/T0Morrow/T0Mpage.html">http://members.aol.com/T0Morrow/T0Mpage.html</a>&gt;.  You'll find the shallow-<br>
water location that I'd mentioned to Greg, the Mascarene plateau, described in<br>
the paper's footnotes.<br>
<p>
For now, at least, my longer essay, "Extropia," remains in editing.  The legal<br>
and geographic details in "The Last Free Place" will, however, probably make<br>
it of more use to would-be nation builders than the philosophical musings of<br>
"Extropia."<br>

<i>&gt;[T]his "last free place on earth" could be very important.  As far as I</i><br>

<p>
I've corresponded with government officials in the vicinity of the Mascarene<br>
Plateau about just that question.  But on that count I will for now remain<br>
cryptic.  It's less a function of cloak-and-dagger stuff than of time<br>
commitments, however.<br>
