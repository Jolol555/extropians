<p>
Your premise that "most violent people were treated violently as <br>
children" is probably true. However:<br>
1. Research has shown that most children who were treated violently as <br>
children do NOT become violent as adults.<br>
2. A higher percentage of those mistreated DO become more violent as <br>
adults than those who were not abused, but this higher percentage is <br>
STILL a minority.<br>
3. So the so-called "cycle of violence" really does not happen in most <br>
cases. (I can provide evidence of this study, if you want, but I'll have <br>
to do a little digging.)<br>
Although a higher percentage of abused children are predisposed to <br>
become more violent as adults, I am a firm believer in free will (except <br>
in very young children), and group statistics are not relevant to <br>
individuals. It's like saying most white males in the U.S. are <br>
Protestants, even though I am not a Protestant, or men commit most <br>
violent crimes, but that fact has no relevance to me personally. I <br>
choose not to engage in murder and mayhem. This does not mean abuse is <br>
OK, so the "abuse excuse" does not impress me when used by adult <br>
sociopaths. <br>
<p>
You may be correct that there are better alternatives to giving a kid a <br>
few whacks in most cases. However, I still think it is appropriate in <br>
cases of really bad behavior when all else has failed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;(Actually, even most kids who really are abused do not turn</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; violent-there is ALWAYS a choice involved.)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Go back and read Alice Miller. I am not convinced that decisions made &gt;in</i><br>
<i>&gt;childhood represent true choices.</i><br>
<p>
I think that once children reach seven or so, they are capable of making <br>
some choices and should generally be held accountable for what they do. <br>
How do you define "childhood" (the legal definition is generally anyone <br>
under 18) and how do you define "true choice?"<br>
I am not familiar with Alice Miller.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'm very happy you never</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; have hit your kids. Good for you. However, do you really think your</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; child rearing methods will work with any and all kids?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I only have to deal with a single case here, which works.</i><br>
<p>
Fine. I don't argue with success.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; At any rate, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; idea that giving a kid a few whacks on the bottom once in a while</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; (especially after the kid has been really bad, in this case he</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; practically killed the family pet!) "perpetuates a cycle of violence" </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; just one of those cliches</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that I really don't find any empirical support for.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your posting certainly had the rhetoric which comes from those who</i><br>
<i>&gt;espouse abuse as justified.... So I responded to that.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I just don't see an occasional whack on the butt as abuse.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; How do you explain</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the low crime rates in the U.S. from 1932-60 when many, if not most,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; parents were giving their kids an occasional spanking?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think violence statistics have many more causes than occasional</i><br>
<i>&gt;spanking. I can't remember the logical fallacy here, does someone on &gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;list know the name of it??</i><br>
<p>
Well, in a way the issue is complex, but in another way it isn't. People <br>
are violent because they see some personal advantage in it for them. As <br>
Von Mises points out, all human action is an attempt to end a state of <br>
unease, discomfort or dissatisfaction.<br>
<p>
I have taken Statistics and I know that correlation does not prove <br>
causation, but it can suggest some relationship.<br>
<p>
As an example, obviously it would be silly to say the Britain has a <br>
lower murder rate than we do because they have a Queen and we don't. <br>
There are other variables that account for the difference. However, it <br>
is not silly to say that there is a cause and effect relationship <br>
between democracy and peace. (Democratic states do not go to war against <br>
each other anymore, and no other variable other than democracy can <br>
account for this.) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; However, I really don't understand people who</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; think that parents who have a different philosophy of discipline than</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; they do are evil monsters who are turning their kids into sociopaths.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think you are reading more into my post that what I was saying.</i><br>
<p>
Ok, I accept that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; By the way, I don't have kids. "Good", I'm sure you are thinking , </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Mr.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Ra.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well if you ever do so, be sure to examine the nonviolent child rearing</i><br>
<i>&gt;options available so you don't have to whack them...</i><br>
<p>
I'd be happy to look into it. :-)<br>
