<i>&gt; From: Peter James &lt;scary@pavilion.co.uk&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I wanted to make the point that immortality through science will happen</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether we like it or not,and to make people realise that yet another</i><br>
<i>&gt; development in science for which we are totally unprepared, is only just</i><br>
<i>&gt; around the corner.   Science constantly gallops ahead of our ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt; comprehend the issues it raises.  In Host, the scientist, Dr Joe Messenger</i><br>
<i>&gt; is determined to replicate human consciousness in a computer, with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ultimate aim of humans being able to download (or upload...) their brains</i><br>
<i>&gt; into it and live on either in a virtual state, and ultimately be uploaded</i><br>
<i>&gt; back into new biological bodies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, without giving too much of the story away (although the film</i><br>
<i>&gt; ending is very different) although he achieves his aim, he is concerned</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the human race is not yet ready to live forever.  I don't think this</i><br>
<i>&gt; is so very different from Darwin holding back his theory of natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; selection for thirty years, or from Einstein's quandry about helping to</i><br>
<i>&gt; develop the bomb.  Surely it is a good thing for writers to create</i><br>
<i>&gt; characters who do have a moral consciences.  Joe Messenger is a decent guy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; He realises he has achieved something that is too big a step for humans</i><br>
<i>&gt; right now.  </i><br>
Is it? Of all possible discoveries, "immortality" must be about the *least*<br>
threatening one. People just stop dying of old age. That's hardly going to<br>
bring about the end of civilization, IMO. On the contrary, life might start <br>
to get valued some more once death is no longer an absolute certainty. <br>
I don't think it would be moral to withhold such an important invention, but <br>
rather extremely *immoral* because millions of lives are lost in the "waiting <br>
period", only because the scientist(s) in question *assume(s)* (in his/their <br>
limited wisdom) that others are too stupid to deal with extended<br>
lifespans. Personally, I'd rather risk suffering and death as a result of <br>
my own decisions, than to be coerced "for my own good". In the case <br>
of immortality the choice is easy...let's have it NOW! :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Surely this what writers should be doing?  Examing the issues</i><br>
<i>&gt; of our times?</i><br>
I agree, but they can also help to shape history by presenting important<br>
technologies in a very *positive* way (like Jim Halperin does with cryonics <br>
in The First Immortal) instead of the usual doom &amp; gloom moral high horse <br>
stuff.<br>
