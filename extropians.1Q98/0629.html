Yeah, everyone should start coding in Perl :-) It rocks!<br>
Seriously, it would seem to require some kind of AI to get<br>
any farther than what we have now ?<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What I was thinking would be a high priority for software development</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies is a form of semi-automated programming software.  Basically,</i><br>
<i>&gt; this would be a very high-level programming language which could help the</i><br>
<i>&gt; programmer do in little time what previously took hours of coding.  Since</i><br>
<i>&gt; it isn't likely that we'll see a significantly higher percentage of</i><br>
<i>&gt; people becoming computer programmers, what we need are tools to help</i><br>
<i>&gt; those programmers be much more productive with their time.  Also, tools</i><br>
<i>&gt; like these will likely get rid of much of the more boring aspects of</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer programming, which are boring because they require very little</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought and could be better done by a computer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I know a lot of you on this list are computer programmers; do any of you</i><br>
<i>&gt; know about developments in very high level programming languages?</i><br>
