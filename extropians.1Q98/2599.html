From: Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;<br>

<i>&gt;Stephen Hawking gave a talk at the White House tonight.  According</i><br>
<i>&gt;to news reports, he predicted that the next century would see the</i><br>
<i>&gt;human race substantially altering itself.</i><br>
<p>
I only caught half of his talk, but was very impressed, if only<br>
Billary (the Bill, Hillary symbiote) would have kept quiet.<br>
<p>
Does Dr Hawking have an E-mail address? A snailmail address? I<br>
would be delighted to guest sponsor him (basic) as a member of the<br>
Extropy Institute. <br>
<p>
Imagine Dr Hawking at the EXI conference!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Hawking's failing body has no doubt made him more aware than most</i><br>
<i>&gt;people of the substantial need for improvements in our biological</i><br>
<i>&gt;nature. Maybe all the "medical ethicists" who shudder with horror</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the thought of cloning and genetic engineering would have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;different view if they could spend a few days in Hawking's</i><br>
<i>&gt;wheelchair.</i><br>
<p>
An excellent point, Christopher Reeve has done an excellent job as<br>
well, I nominate both for "Extropian of the year." (maybe Mr Reeve<br>
would like to join us as well.)<br>
