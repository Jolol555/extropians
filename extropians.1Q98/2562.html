More and more companies are downsizing.<br>
<p>
More and more people are working for themselves, and many are [or want<br>
to] work out of their homes.<br>
<p>
There are something like 80,000,000 users of the Internet today.  The<br>
Net is a wild, crazy, ever-changing baby that seems to be living in the<br>
days of the old west.  There are no rules because technology keeps<br>
changing the playing field.<br>
<p>
So how can an individual work from home and take advantage of this Dodge<br>
City that surrounds us?<br>
<p>
Its hard.  Really hard.  If you are selling a service, or a product, and<br>
you are not a large company, what can you do?<br>
<p>
Email.<br>
<p>
Spam?  No - responsible email, with no hype, no lies, no bull.  Yes,<br>
there are some who say that ANY form of unsolicited email is illegal.<br>
Wrong!!!<br>
__________________________________________________________________<br>
<p>
  A landmark decision in the State of Washington recently determined<br>
that bulk email<br>
  advertising is absolutely legal and proper.  No state or federal court<br>
has ruled otherwise.<br>
__________________________________________________________________<br>
<p>
So, by using responsible email, you can reach that huge market at a<br>
fraction of the cost of traditional bulk mail.  As low as 1/10th of a<br>
cent per address....<br>
<p>
If you are interested in learning more about this, please call<br>
561-835-4077, or send a fax to 561-835-0690 and be sure to leave your<br>
name, phone and email address.  No obligation, no push, no hype.  Just<br>
honest information.<br>
<p>
Thanks for your time, and we hope your day is filled with quality time.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Dave<br>
