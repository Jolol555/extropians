In the interest of moving the disscusion along, if one 95% agrees with a<br>
responding post does one let it go? If not, John I made an observation<br>
of my trips, I said that the peoples views are directly relational to<br>
the official news media and that there used to be a strata of economic<br>
levels but that now there is just desperate poverty. I will now add that<br>
in my opinion that is macro economically bad.  I find it difficult to<br>
sumarize large complex sweeping issues as you do, honest your's was a<br>
good and interesting post, it is just me.  I am uncomfortable in<br>
discussing in depth my experiances because I do respect the fact that<br>
Cuba is a police state and I would not want to put at risk people I<br>
spoke with other than to say they were, I believe, frank with me. I did<br>
not agree with much of there views, personally, but understand their<br>
position. Equally while I am not a US citizen I spend much time there<br>
and while perfectly in my right to do business with Cuba it is not in my<br>
interest to directly disrespect US laws, even if I personally disagree<br>
with them.  I will finish by by adding that the result of my due<br>
diligence on Cuba is that I suggested that we pass on putting funds in<br>
now. In my opinion  Castro has bought time for HIS government by his<br>
policies and using the US as the excuse for all their woes, but  have<br>
only postponed and magnified the economic dislocations to come when he<br>
is gone.  The primary reason, of many, as reported to me, was that those<br>
that left who were the former middle class or rich  have the resources<br>
to  "buy" Cuba many times over and those who are still there know it,<br>
resent it bitterly, and are powerless to do any thing about it. I<br>
believe all will work out, painfully, but I do not want to be at risk<br>
during the process.  <br>

I still stand by my "feeling" on the pertinence of this thread but admit<br>
it sure has got more interesting of late.<br>
