Three levels of freedom are relevant to<br>
this article:<br>
<p>
1. The freedom philosophy level;<br>
<p>
2. The practical living-free level;<br>
<p>
3. The complete peme-free level.<br>
<p>
(Other freedom levels are beyond the<br>
scope of this article.)<br>
<p>
[Note: Earlier parts of this "peme debate"<br>
-- including the "peme rules" -- can be found<br>
at &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm</a>&gt;.]<br>
<p>
<p>
1. The freedom philosophy level<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<p>
The first level is that of the "typical"<br>
libertarian, anarchist, egoist, etc.<br>
Typically at this level, you change<br>
your belief system from believing in<br>
statism to believing in freedom.  You<br>
discuss, debate, and argue freedom issues<br>
with others.  You may work as an activist,<br>
promoting the Libertarian Party, writing<br>
letters to editors and politicians, etc.<br>
You probably live largely as an "obedient<br>
citizen" and you probably "pay your taxes."<br>
<p>
At this level, you clear most or all<br>
surface pemes from your brain.  You may<br>
believe that in order to enjoy the degree<br>
of freedom you desire, "the system has to<br>
be changed" -- a peme near the surface?<br>
<p>
At this level, you probably follow peme<br>
rule 19:<br>
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary<br>
peme purveyors) communicate -- although<br>
they may question, attack, and expose a<br>
few surface pemes -- they shall make a<br>
special effort to use deep pemes in their<br>
language -- in order to maximize peme<br>
survival and propagation."<br>
<p>
I must emphasize that it's perfectly OK<br>
to operate at freedom level 1.  Given the<br>
nature of "the system" and the relative<br>
difficulty of earning a living in level<br>
2, at this time it's more appropriate<br>
for most freedom lovers to operate in<br>
level 1.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. The practical living-free level<br>
----------------------------------<br>
<p>
The second level is that of people who<br>
have decided to "exit the system" --<br>
most notably the "tax system."  At this<br>
level, you seek to not only talk freedom,<br>
but to also live freedom.  You may have<br>
been influenced by Harry Browne's 'How I<br>
Found Freedom in an Unfree World.'  You<br>
learn what I call "Freedom Technology":<br>
The practical knowledge, methods, and<br>
skills to live free; the street-smart<br>
know-how to outwit bureaucrats and their<br>
agents, running rings around them; etc.<br>
<p>
Browne's 'How I Found Freedom' is available from<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.bookzone.com/bookzone/10001105.html">http://www.bookzone.com/bookzone/10001105.html</a>&gt;.<br>
See also &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/ffp05.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/ffp05.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
To operate at this level, you need to<br>
overcome *fear* of "the system."  You<br>
also *disobey* "the system" in practical<br>
and profitable ways.  You may also take<br>
some risks that would be unacceptable to<br>
someone who decides to remain in level 1.<br>
You probably experience "the system" as<br>
far less powerful than the way it tends<br>
to be perceived by a level-1 person.<br>
<p>
You may also learn a few "tricks" about<br>
stopping bureaucrats who attack you --<br>
for a real-time example, see<br>
&lt;<a href="http://colossus.net/wepinsto/store/freetech/irscase/intro.html">http://colossus.net/wepinsto/store/freetech/irscase/intro.html</a>&gt;.<br>
This is a former "federal employee" who<br>
decided to "exit the tax system."  The<br>
great merit of this example is that it's<br>
real-time -- as soon as any communication<br>
is received or sent, it's posted to the<br>
website.<br>
<p>
You may also learn a great deal about typical<br>
bureaucrat behavior, and how to outwit them --<br>
see &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl10a.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl10a.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
At this level you may discover that you<br>
are free by nature, by dint of the fact<br>
that you and only you control the energy<br>
that animates your body -- see 'The<br>
Discovery of Freedom' by Rose Wilder Lane<br>
-- &lt;<a href="http://www.laissezfaire.org/in0001.html">http://www.laissezfaire.org/in0001.html</a>&gt; and<br>
'The Mainspring of Human Progress' by Henry Grady Weaver --<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1572460644/1694-5051060-378695">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1572460644/1694-5051060-378695</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
You may also discover that you have power<br>
of choice and that this is an awesome power<br>
-- though it may require strengthening.<br>
<p>
"PTs" also tend to operate at this level.<br>
PT = "permanent tourist," "prior taxpayer,"<br>
etc. -- see &lt;<a href="http://www.britnet.co.uk/scope/">http://www.britnet.co.uk/scope/</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
People who operate at this level tend to<br>
invest considerable time and effort in<br>
improving their ability to assess relative<br>
risks.<br>
<p>
At this level, you probably still follow<br>
peme rule 19:<br>
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary<br>
peme purveyors) communicate -- although<br>
they may question, attack, and expose a<br>
few surface pemes -- they shall make a<br>
special effort to use deep pemes in their<br>
language -- in order to maximize peme<br>
survival and propagation."<br>
<p>
[Warning: For some there could be what I call<br>
"patriot traps" in level 2.  For some heroes<br>
it's appropriate to get rid of SSNs, driver's<br>
licences, car registration, etc.  If they<br>
know what they're doing and they have the<br>
courage, skills, and support system to<br>
confront the bureaucrats head-on and win,<br>
I salute them.  The trap is that such<br>
strategies can result in impoverishment<br>
and jail time for the ill-prepared.]<br>
<p>
<p>
3. The complete peme-free level<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<p>
The third level is that of people who have<br>
decided to "exit the system" at the deepest<br>
level of intellect.  They have cleared the<br>
deepest pemes from their brains.  At every<br>
*appropriate* opportunity, they question and<br>
attack the pemes that appear in the thought<br>
and communication of those they associate<br>
with.<br>
<p>
The "appropriate" above must be stressed.<br>
Most of the time it's inappropriate to<br>
question or attack deep pemes -- it tends<br>
to destroy conversations and even friendships;<br>
and most of your audience will simply think<br>
you're crazy -- in accordance with peme rules:<br>
"11. Any humans who attempt to clear any deep<br>
pemes from their brains shall experience a<br>
strong and compelling inner voice telling them,<br>
"I've got to stop this or I'll go crazy!"<br>
12. Any human who attempts to question, attack,<br>
or expose any deep peme shall be ignored,<br>
ridiculed, or vilified by other humans."<br>
<p>
At this level, your perception of "the system"<br>
changes dramatically.  The example of Simon<br>
Baker illustrates this -- see<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm</a>&gt;.<br>

<i>&gt;The original idea </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[i.e., "The peme program seems to consist of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"peme rules" -- or a similar set of rules (could</i><br>
<i>&gt;also vary from person to person) -- together with</i><br>
<i>&gt;a set of "surface pemes" and a set of "deep</i><br>
<i>&gt;pemes"]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;seemed to be a promising one - then one gets to the specifications. With</i><br>
<i>&gt;the exception of # 14 and 24 these purported "rules" don't seem to have any</i><br>
<i>&gt;substance, but that has been rather typical of the "magic formula"</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggestions of Mr. Mann in the past. Let me just suggest what some of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;substantive rules look like, at least in this society:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(1) Education requires public schools. Without such schools we would all be</i><br>
<i>&gt;illiterate and there would be no social unity. Unfortunately, public</i><br>
<i>&gt;schools today are sufferring from a short sighted policy of underinvestment</i><br>
<i>&gt;and require significantly greater funding. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(2) Our physical safety requires a strong government police force, the duty</i><br>
<i>&gt;of which is to suppress, imprision or kill the "bad guys" who would rape,</i><br>
<i>&gt;plunder and kill we good guys if allowed to run around unchecked. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(3) The Judges who sit on our Courts invariably act in the public interest</i><br>
<i>&gt;without regard to who issues their paycheck or their other personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;interests. Hence, more control should be given to reliable Judges and taken</i><br>
<i>&gt;away from unreliable lawyers and juries. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(4) Lawyers are, in any case, vile and evil and out to plunder everyone.</i><br>
<i>&gt;They are justifiably the most hated profession in the society. Probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;lawyers should become public employees so that they would share the</i><br>
<i>&gt;disinterested character of judges. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(5) Families, churches, business firms and all other sorts of associations</i><br>
<i>&gt;or institutions that are not formed for the purpose of charity per se</i><br>
<i>&gt;[preferably the currently trendy charity] are suspect, and should be</i><br>
<i>&gt;closely monitored and controlled by the government. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(6) The government represents all of us, whether or not we voted for those</i><br>
<i>&gt;currently in power or  whether or not we agree with what those in power are</i><br>
<i>&gt;doing. If we don't like what is being done, we should vote differently next</i><br>
<i>&gt;time. [Yes, I know it's self-contradictory.]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(7) When discussing public matters the term "we" [or other appropriate</i><br>
<i>&gt;royal plural] is always used to refer to views "we" like.    </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I could go on for about another 40-50 points, but I'm late for work......</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps Mr. Mann will help with the list [NOT]......</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From what I know about Curmudgeon Corner, he operates at</i><br>
freedom level 1; he has stated that it's too risky for<br>
him to operate at level 2; and he believes "you can't use<br>
paperwork to stop bureaucrats" -- in contrast to the example at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://colossus.net/wepinsto/store/freetech/irscase/intro.html">http://colossus.net/wepinsto/store/freetech/irscase/intro.html</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
Curmudgeon's rules are typical of the surface pemes<br>
someone in freedom level 1 has erased from his brain.<br>
Those familiar with deep pemes will recognize that<br>
Curmudgeon's rules are heavily infested with deep<br>
pemes -- in accordance with peme rule 19:<br>
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary<br>
peme purveyors) communicate -- although<br>
they may question, attack, and expose a<br>
few surface pemes -- they shall make a<br>
special effort to use deep pemes in their<br>
language -- in order to maximize peme<br>
survival and propagation."<br>
<p>
My peme communications are not aimed at persuading<br>
the "man in the street" to advance to freedom level<br>
1.  They are aimed at freedom lovers operating at<br>
levels 1 and 2.  There is more you can do to expand<br>
your freedom.  You may even discover something about<br>
the most basic factors on which the power of tyrants<br>
depends, and what needs to be done to collapse that<br>
power.<br>

I suspect that Bill operates in freedom level 1.<br>
<p>
Bill, you free yourself by changing certain belief<br>
systems (surface pemes), and by acquiring the knowledge<br>
and skills to live free -- see Harry Browne references<br>
above.  Then you go beyond that by clearing deep pemes<br>
from your brain.<br>
<p>
Power is often a two-way street.  Consider a relationship<br>
between a strong person and a weak person.  The strong<br>
person has a great deal of power over the weak person.<br>
The weak person can reduce that power in two ways:<br>
(1) Reducing the power of the strong person;<br>
(2) Increasing his own power.  (Or both.)<br>
The same applies to any relationship you may have<br>
with any "powerful group" you feel oppressed by.<br>
<p>
My wish is that you will increase your personal<br>
power to the point that you will regard the statement,<br>
"An individual, no matter how enlightened, is powerless<br>
without the co-operation of of a large group," as one<br>
of the silliest things you've ever said.<br>
<p>
Part of the process of increasing your personal power<br>
will consist of clearing both surface and deep pemes<br>
from your brain.  Maybe you can get some inspiration<br>
from someone who lives in your part of the world: David<br>
T. Freeman -- see &lt;<a href="http://www.mind-trek.com/index.htm">http://www.mind-trek.com/index.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
