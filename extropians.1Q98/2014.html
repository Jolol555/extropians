"If you upload your mind into a computer by means of copying brain<br>
waves,(I don't know how, it just seems like that work) or however else<br>
you would do it, you'd still have a hard copy of your mind inside your<br>
body.  My point is, the mind in the computer would be a seperate entity<br>
that just thought like you do.  It wouldn't be you inside the computer,<br>
just a copy.  You'd wouldn't control the computer, the thing controlling<br>
the computer would only be similar to you.  Anyway, I'm just a student<br>
and probably am way out of my league, but it sounds like a load of crap<br>
to me.  Please reply."<br>
<p>
Remember that since your mind is copied into the computer, the computer<br>
would actually think it is you; it would have all your memories, your<br>
disposition, your beliefs.  It would in fact be you, from it's point of<br>
view, and the body of flesh and blood would in fact be you, from it's<br>
point of view.  They would both be instances of your mind supported by a<br>
physical configuration of matter.  From your point of view in the<br>
computer, you were in the meat-brain, and now you are here.  From the<br>
point of view of you in the meat-brain, you were subjected to the<br>
scanning device, and that's it.  You in the meat-brain would have doubts<br>
about whether you are also in the computer, but you in the computer would<br>
have no doubts about that, although, you may wonder if the copying<br>
process did something to the meat-brain, so that it's not really you. You<br>
would't be controlling the meat-brain, the thing controlling the<br>
meat-brain would only be similar to you. It's simply a matter of<br>
perspective.<br>
