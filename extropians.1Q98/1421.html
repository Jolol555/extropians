<p>
This (the follow email) makes perfects sense, the thing that confuses me<br>
is:<br>
<p>
(excuss my incoherent rambling, I do become repetative)<br>
<p>
1. person undergos perfect suspended animation<br>
2. half their atoms ( randomly picked ) are plucked out of their body and<br>
brain and replaced by other atoms. The plucked out atoms are joined to new<br>
atoms<br>
3. net result<br>
  two individuals in suspended animation that are perfect copies of each<br>
other and only differ in<br>
	1) what random assembly/reassemble mistakes were made<br>
	2) and which suspension vat they are in.<br>
<p>
4) What happen when they wake up. Who went to sleep, who woke up, who was<br>
"born"<br>
<p>
It makes me slightly dizzy, but that doesn't mean there is a problem, or<br>
any need to invoke the supernatural, but I'ld feel better if I wasn't<br>
cloned (mind and body) in suspension, even though we'ld become two totally<br>
differnt people (with shared memories) And there is certainly nothing<br>
wrong with that, its just creation of another person. But what happened to<br>
the old one ? I'ld rather be a new twin and think I had been frozen<br>
earlier than be a person going into a freezing and duplication process and<br>
being confused about how a person can be split in two and become two<br>
differnent individual. <br>
<p>
Can anyone explain away this apprehension in a logical/scientific manner ?<br>
