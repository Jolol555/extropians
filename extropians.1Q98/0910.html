<i>&gt;      Landlords charge rent: States charge taxes.  Most states let you </i><br>
<i>&gt;leave, most of the time.  Most landlords ditto.  I had the following </i><br>
<i>&gt;argument with David Ramsay Steele, an anarcho-capitalist theoretician.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Agorism and anarcho-capitalism are fundamentally different ideas, so we </i><br>
<i>&gt;argued a lot...  He attacked me and threatened to kill me once or twice.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From Konkin's writings, I got the idea that agorism is just </i><br>
anarcho-capitalism in practice right now.  Is your version <br>
different?  How would an a-c theoretician justify attacking you, <br>
anyway?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      It seems to me, I said playfully, that any crafty group of </i><br>
<i>&gt;capitalist could replicate the evils of government in a pre-existing </i><br>
<i>&gt;anarcho-capitalist society by focusing their resources on buying a key </i><br>
<i>&gt;resource, then imposing conditions of use on it:  i.e. fervent Islamic </i><br>
<i>&gt;capitalists could buy the roads, then make adherence to Islam a</i><br>
condition <br>
<i>&gt;of use for all the customers. They aren't interested in selling the</i><br>
roads <br>
<i>&gt;again, remember, nor do they care about maximizing their _financial_ </i><br>
<i>&gt;return on capital.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      So how would we address this problem?</i><br>
<p>
If it were to become a real problem, some other crafty capitalist<br>
would build more roads. &lt;shrug&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      David Ramsay Steele just shrugged this off by saying "We would </i><br>
<i>&gt;have </i><br>
<i>&gt;a revolution, and reassign the property rights."   Oh, right...</i><br>
<p>
An alleged anarcho-capitalist said this?  Not *my* property<br>
rights, and I'll defend my neighbors' too, no matter what their<br>
religion.<br>
