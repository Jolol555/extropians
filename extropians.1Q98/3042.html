For what it's worth (perhaps not much), here's a mass-market newspaper<br>
review I published some months ago of Pinker's book and another by Per Bak.<br>
 Bottom line: I endorse Greg's view, not Roderick's.<br>
<p>
===========================<br>
<p>
HOW NATURE WORKS<br>
The Science of Self-Organized Criticality<br>
by Per Bak<br>
Oxford University Press, 212pp.<br>
HOW THE MIND WORKS<br>
by Steven Pinker<br>
Allen Lane, 660pp<br>
<p>
In the 1980s, `chaos' was science's sexy topic, although people kept<br>
misunderstanding it.  Chaos dynamics found that the world's rich and<br>
unpredictable confusion hid simple rules.  By the early 1990s, the buzz<br>
word became `complexity'.  Interesting things (life especially) exist<br>
mostly on a boundary between frozen order and hissing chaos.  Now there's a<br>
new spin: the spontaneous emergence of those complicated and lovely things<br>
is due to `self-organised criticality'.  <br>
<p>
Criticality occurs when all the parts of a system impact on each other<br>
holistically.  Its emblem is a pile of rice.  Trickle long-grain rice<br>
steadily onto a flat surface and it builds into a cone, shedding as many<br>
specks as it gains - but in jolts and avalanches, small and large.<br>
<p>
Despite Per Bak's enthusiasm, his beguiling book should be titled `Some of<br>
the Ways Nature Works Some of the Time'.  Still, in its brief account, he<br>
offers a startling new unified picture of many wildly different phenomena:<br>
word use frequencies, the size and number of earthquakes, the surprising<br>
computer program called the `Game of Life', dinosaur and other extinctions,<br>
the limits of planned economies, and why we will never get rid of traffic<br>
jams.  Oh yes, and he thinks he's learned how the brain works.<br>
<p>
It's all due to those avalanches.  For Bak, a frequent visitor to the Sante<br>
Fe Institute, home of complexity studies, the secret of life is a<br>
mathematical peculiarity called 1/f (`one-over-f') noise.  Unlike chaos,<br>
which has a boring `white noise' signal, this key regime creates a weirdly<br>
universal pattern.  Mapping it, you get a tall spike on one side, tailing<br>
off quickly as the curve moves to the right.  Consider urban scales: for<br>
every megalopolis of ten million inhabitants, there are roughly 10 cities<br>
with a million, 100 with 100,000, and a thousand towns with only 10,000.  <br>
<p>
It's the same with earthquakes, as measured by the Gutenberg-Richter law.<br>
Most are barely detectable.  Some shake villages.  Very few are dangerous<br>
monsters.  Snow avalanches follow much the same pattern.  Graph such<br>
frequencies on a logarithmic chart and you get a straight line,<br>
representing a neat equation.  This is Bak's key to how nature works, and<br>
you'll need to read his little book with some attention to see why he might<br>
be at least partly right.<br>
<p>
Does it matter if he is?  Indeed it does.  Systems poised at<br>
self-organising criticality (SOC) are neither too hot nor too cold,<br>
bubbling with novelty.  Every now and then, an awful avalanche is triggered<br>
by some tiny event that can't be identified in advance.  It doesn't take a<br>
killer asteroid from space, Bak claims, to wipe out the dinosaurs.  SOC<br>
gives us eco-catastrophe for free, the downside of complexity.  Sante Fe's<br>
Stuart Kauffman says of such ideas: `I have a feeling that all this shit<br>
links together in some wonderful way.'  Couldn't put it better myself.<br>
<p>
Or does it link together just because the human mind is a gadget designed<br>
by natural selection to extract (and impose) patterns or features on the<br>
confusion of the world?  Yes and no, according to Steven Pinker's superb<br>
new book.  Three times as stout as Bak's, a paperback well worth its thirty<br>
dollars, Pinker's romp through cognitive science's current portrait of the<br>
mind covers an immense amount of territory.  It's terrifyingly up to date -<br>
900-odd apposite references take up 37 pages.  Luckily Pinker wears his<br>
learning lightly and with appealing whimsy.<br>
<p>
"I want to convince you," he says at the outset, "that our minds are not<br>
animated by some godly vapour or single wonder principle."  Rather, mind is<br>
a complex package of small dedicated specialists, "and thus is packed with<br>
high-tech systems each contrived to overcome its own obstacles".  The mind,<br>
Pinker argues, is what the brain does.  Even if complexity theorists like<br>
Bak are right, even if mind emerges only in certain self-organising regimes<br>
of criticality, the way it arises is heavily influenced by the solutions<br>
history has imposed on its evolving development.  We are each parliaments<br>
or coalitions of small neural experts.<br>
<p>
The ancients suggested that inside each human was a homunculus, a `little<br>
man' who watched, as it were, from behind the eyes.  That idea hindered<br>
science and philosophy for ages, and was eventually hustled out of both<br>
biology and literary theory.  Now the homunculus has returned, although in<br>
a new guise.  The brain is built of numerous agents, some of them<br>
genetically hardwired, each with limited but focussed powers, compiled<br>
together into characteristic modes of sensing, feeling and reasoning - into<br>
faculties, another discarded term making a comeback.<br>
<p>
Forcing this reappraisal are many quite recent experiments, using<br>
astounding new technologies to peer inside the working parts of humans and<br>
less complex animals.  Pinker leads his charmed reader through a series of<br>
exemplary case histories in `reverse-engineering'.  We know what vision<br>
does, for example, and what parts of the brain and optic tract are involved<br>
- but to understand the entire impossible process it's necessary to probe<br>
backwards, using evolutionary insights as a guide.<br>
<p>
A central chapter picks apart what's going on when you gaze at one of those<br>
weird computer-generated pictures made up of squiggly lines.  Let your eyes<br>
defocus, and an elephant or T. Rex pops out in three dimensions.  As it<br>
happens I don't have the neural machinery to perform this useful trick,<br>
because my brain wasn't wired up correctly in infancy.  Hence, like a few<br>
percent of the population, both stereograms and reality are quite flat to<br>
me (although luckily I can use other cues to stop myself running into the<br>
back of the car ahead).  Pinker's story takes some small effort to follow,<br>
but I recommend the trip, because it's a delightful exploration of... well,<br>
of how minds work.  Angry minds, family minds, coarse, subtle and<br>
artificial minds.  Plus, in the final chapter, the meaning of life.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, don't expect more than is reasonable.  Pinker states<br>
candidly at the start: "we don't understand how the mind works - not nearly<br>
as well as we understand how the body works".  Even so, "dozens of<br>
mysteries of the mind, from mental images to romantic love, have recently<br>
been upgraded to problems" rather than impenetrable mysteries.  But what<br>
about the teachings and verities of the past?  "Our old ideas," he observes<br>
stingingly, "were too vapid to be wrong."<br>
<p>
Pinker's enjoyable treasure-trove, perhaps even better than his excellent<br>
The Language Instinct, meets the goal he set: "to get you to step outside<br>
your own mind for a moment and see your thoughts and feelings as<br>
magnificent contrivances of the natural world".  If you're looking for a<br>
summer book to expand and explain your mind at the same time, this is it.<br>
