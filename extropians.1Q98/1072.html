I'm curious how China is dealing with the Asian Market Flu. Did they cause<br>
it to discredit free markets? Will they use it to justify more control in<br>
Hong Kong? Has the level of international money basically voting with its<br>
dollars on the asian concept of a "different, asian form of human rights"<br>
showed that their arrogance is misplaced?<br>
<p>
Certainly their current military modernization program is ominous, but they<br>
haven't really done much in blatant agression in a long time, with the<br>
exception of the 'exercise' they had near Taiwan a couple years ago in<br>
response to the elections there. That they seem to be taking such a long<br>
term strategy for eventual, peaceful reintegration of Taiwan with mainland<br>
China indicates to me that they are at least a bit more rational than other<br>
tyrants in the past. What I really worry about is 30 years down the road.<br>
The population control program in China is having the effect of a much<br>
larger percentage of the population being born as males. Sociologists have<br>
commented in the past on the relative levels of agression of societies with<br>
balanced versus imbalanced populations of genders. I wonding if having so<br>
many frustrated males in the population 20-30 years from now will wind up<br>
with a much more militarist regieme coming to power.<br>
