Hello all,<br>
<p>
Last April, the Council of Europe drew up and opened for signatures, the<br>
Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.<br>
[<a href="http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/168e.htm">http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/168e.htm</a>] So far, only one country<br>
(Slovakia) has signed it.<br>
<p>
In designing this Convention, the Council intended to build upon the<br>
original European Convention on Human Rights<br>
<a href="http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/e-dh.htm#conv-dh">http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/e-dh.htm#conv-dh</a>) with a stated intent to<br>
'protect the dignity and identity of all human beings and guarantee<br>
everyone, without discrimination, respect for their integrity and other<br>
rights and fundamental freedoms with regard to the application of<br>
biology and medicine.' [Article I, Conv. on Biomedicine]<br>
<p>
Building upon this intent, in the wake of Richard Seed's announcement<br>
that he would attempt the first human clone, the Council drew up a<br>
Additional Protocol to the Convention on Biomedicine called the<br>
Additional Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings<br>
(<a href="http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/164e.htm">http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/164e.htm</a>). So far, no countries have<br>
signed it.<br>
<p>
The Human Cloning Protocol's main intent is to make explicit that human<br>
clones are prohibited by the Convention on Biomedicine. And for the most<br>
part, the Convention on Biomedicine seems relatively common-sense<br>
ethics-wise (e.g., no experimentation on humans without consent, no<br>
discrimination based upon genetic heritage, etc.) <br>
<p>
But buried, it seems, among the common-sense articles, in Chapter 4,<br>
Article 13 we read, 'An intervention seeking to modify the human genome<br>
may only be undertaken for preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic<br>
purposes and only if its aim is not to introduce any modification in the<br>
genome of any descendants.'<br>
<p>
Notably absent in this list of allowable uses is modification of the<br>
genome for *augmentative* purposes. It is technically prohibited<br>
(barring some rhetorical gymnastics) to intervene in the human genome<br>
such that a descendant human is *better* than his/her parent. While it<br>
*is* feasible that an augmentative intervention may be designed such<br>
that it falls into the allowable 'preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic<br>
purposes,' this becomes difficult given that the provision requires an<br>
'aim' other than 'modification . . . of any descendants'.<br>
<p>
Fortunately, this is not yet an international law in Europe. And it<br>
doesn't seem that Member States are running to Strasbourg with their<br>
pens in hand to sign it. However, it is extremely disheartening for me<br>
to see that an institution whose goals I think are of the noblest<br>
variety (rights and freedoms for all humans) is willing to deny those<br>
same humans the untold benefits of genetic augmentation because of risks<br>
that are as yet inchoate, and still hardly understood. <br>
<p>
Furthermore, underscoring the prematurity of this treaty, Chapter 11,<br>
Article 29 of the Biomedicine Convention takes an unprecedented step in<br>
allowing the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to give 'advisory<br>
opinions on legal questions concerning the interpretation' of the<br>
Convention even in the absence of a ripened legal issue that implicates<br>
its provisions.<br>
<p>
I am curious to hear from our European friends concerning their<br>
reactions to this, now that it has had time to season. Have there been<br>
any rumblings in the European genetics community? Have any European<br>
governments (members of the Council of Europe) offered position<br>
statements on this? Why is there only one country which has signed the<br>
Biomedicine Convention so far? Why hasn't anyone signed the Cloning<br>
Protocol? Might these government-types be smarter than we give them<br>
credit for?              <br>
