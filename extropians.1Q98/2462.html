<i>&gt; &gt; The reason why I think developing sea based enclaves now is a good idea is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  is an excellent and low cost test bed/training center for long term</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  habitation/colonization in space. For example the figures I believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; John</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Clark contributed of supertanker costs indicates that these are relatively</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cheap.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  A couple tens of millions for a whole supertanker? wow.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, I think John was saying that he thought it might cost ten times the</i><br>
<i>&gt; approximately $100 million figure I supplied to make a supertanker liveable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know if it would be that much, but the all-in cost of acquiring and</i><br>
<i>&gt; converting a very large tanker would surely be more than $200 million and</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably at least $300 million.  To my subjective sense of economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; proportion, this seems like such a high threshold of investment that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefits offered by such an extra-national enclave would have to be VERY great</i><br>
<i>&gt; in comparison to continuing a business within the confines of existing</i><br>
<i>&gt; national territories.</i><br>
<p>
I was talking with a freind of mine today who is an oil wildcatter. He said that<br>
the reason tankers are in such demand today isn't for their transportation<br>
capability, but merely for their storeage capacity, due to the present glut<br>
overextending the present capacity of land based storeage for crude. He said that<br>
a short three day war in Iraq would completely dry up this glut, and send tanker<br>
prices down again.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; As to "claiming" things off Earth, the only certain legal regime at this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; time</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; is the UN Outer Space Treaty [snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  However, since the US never signed or ratified this treaty, then any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; operations</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  originating from the US are not bound by this treaty. This includes any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; launches</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  originating from ANY U.S. posession, like the Marianas Islands, Puerto</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rico,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Even if you launch from another site, if you 'reflag' once you get into</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; space,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  then you are sitting happy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A few points here.  Unlike the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt; has formally ratified the UNOST.  This isn't surprising, since the U.S. is one</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the three sponsoring or "repository" countries for that treaty.  The U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt; signed the treaty on January 27, 1967, the very first day it was opened for</i><br>
<i>&gt; signature.  (<a href="http://www.acda.gov/treaties/space5.txt">http://www.acda.gov/treaties/space5.txt</a>)  However, note that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; U.S. accepts UNCLOS as the codification of "customary international law" on</i><br>
<i>&gt; all but one point (the "common heritage of mankind" provisions relating to</i><br>
<i>&gt; seabed resources beyond the 200-mile EEZ limit).  UNOST doesn't contain the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "common heritage" idea.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It is my understanding that while we may have signed it, the Senate never ratified<br>
it. Signing it doesn't mean jack. Also, how does this treaty apply to the same<br>
issues as covered by the Moon treaty, which I know the US has no interest in.<br>
