My point was that the fact that my father hit me a few of times (and on <br>
all occasions it was for a good reason) did not turn me into a violent <br>
person.(Actually, even most kids who really are abused do not turn <br>
violent-there is ALWAYS a choice involved.) I'm very happy you never <br>
have hit your kids. Good for you. However, do you really think your <br>
child rearing methods will work with any and all kids? At any rate, the <br>
idea that giving a kid a few whacks on the bottom once in a while <br>
(especially after the kid has been really bad, in this case he <br>
practically killed the family pet!) "perpetuates a cycle of violence" is <br>
just one of those cliches <br>
that I really don't find any empirical support for. How do you explain <br>
the low crime rates in the U.S. from 1932-60 when many, if not most, <br>
parents were giving their kids an occasional spanking?<br>
<p>
Please note: I am not defending parents who cause physical damage or hit <br>
their kids for any idiotic thing.(I do not admire Joan Crawford in <br>
"Mommie Dearest.") And I have no problem with anyone who never, ever <br>
spanks their children. However, I really don't understand people who <br>
think that parents who have a different philosophy of discipline than <br>
they do are evil monsters who are turning their kids into sociopaths. <br>
Sorry, I don't buy it.<br>

By the way, I don't have kids. "Good", I'm sure you are thinking , Mr. <br>
Ra.<br>
