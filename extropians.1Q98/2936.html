No: I'm _not_ saying that we should eliminate punishment. What I'm saying<br>
is that the severity of punishment -- be it a week in prison or a year,<br>
or ten years, or a hanging -- is not the factor that deters people from<br>
criminal behaviour; it's the _certainty_ of punishment. Therefore, given<br>
finite resources, we would achieve a better deterrent effect by putting<br>
resources into catching criminals and clearing up crime reports,  rather <br>
than locking them up for long (and expensive) prison sentences. <br>
<p>
A burglar is more likely to be deterred by a 1 year prison sentence, and<br>
an 80-90% probability of capture and conviction, than by a 10 year<br>
sentence but a mere 10% probability of apprehension. (This is one reason<br>
why some parts of europe have low crime rates _and_ light prison<br>
sentences -- but very efficient police forces who catch most criminal<br>
very rapidly.) Of course, it's a lot easier for a grandstanding<br>
politician to pass a law mandating twenty year prison sentences for<br>
burglars than it is for them to up the police crime clear-up statistics,<br>
so we get stupid laws, draconian punishments, and an effectively zero<br>
probability of arrest -- exactly the conditions that bring the law into<br>
disrepute and disregard!<br>
