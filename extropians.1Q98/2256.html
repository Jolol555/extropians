After making the original posting, I was able to dig up a little<br>
information on the 'net based on what I could remember.  The information<br>
available is really very scant.  I learned about this second-hand from my<br>
father, so I didn't have a terrible lot to go on.<br>
<p>
The company in question is the Haida Corporation, which has very large<br>
timber holdings, as well as significant mining and energy holdings in the<br>
Pacific Northwest.  They are also invested in numerous smaller businesses<br>
including fishing and tourism.  They own a fleet of large cargo ships<br>
(which I have seen in Washington and Alaska) and, from what I hear, have<br>
annual revenues of several hundred million dollars.  From what my father<br>
was telling me, they are a very influential and respected company in the<br>
Pacific Northwest and are well-known for their business prowess.<br>
<p>
The community is Hydaburg, composed almost exclusively of Haida Indians<br>
(pop. ~2,000).  As is typical for these communities, only ~60% of the<br>
population is employed, with ~20% unemployment.  It appears that this is in<br>
fact some sort of tribal corporation.  <br>
<p>
What *is* interesting is the business wisdom and general success of this<br>
particular group.  I have lived on more than one Indian reservation and in<br>
my experience, native Americans are usually not the sharpest business<br>
people around.  However, in this case, the history of the Haida tribe is a<br>
bit unusual.<br>
<p>
Although currently a coastal tribe, they have only lived there for a couple<br>
hundred years.  Apparently the Haida indians historically enjoyed<br>
prosperity as an aggressive merchant tribe from what is now inland British<br>
Columbia.  In the 18th century, they embarked on a series of conquests<br>
along the Pacific coast in order to control important coastal resources.<br>
Through deft political, military, and economic maneuvering they quickly<br>
became one of the wealthiest tribes in the region (until the arrival, in<br>
force, of Europeans).<br>
<p>
<p>
What interested me was that I find the corporate government model to be<br>
superior to traditional models in many ways.  While I am not sure whether<br>
it would scale well to really large populations, the feedback mechanisms in<br>
the corporate model are much quicker, more responsive, and generally better<br>
lubricated than traditional models.  The improved feedback mechanisms<br>
create a much more efficient organism, IMO.  Also, a government that<br>
functions primarily as an economic entity is very unlikely to embark on any<br>
actions for strictly political reasons if it would hurt its bottom line and<br>
would almost never embark on any actions against its own shareholders.  A<br>
corporation that got out of hand could be sold off or dissolved by the<br>
shareholders with minimum difficulty.  Additionally, the prospect of<br>
economic competition keeps the bureaucracy in check.<br>
<p>
Ironically, it would appear that this would work best in an environment<br>
were the corporation is not sovereign in and of its self i.e. there exists<br>
a more powerful entity that exists to enforce the corporate structure.  Or<br>
alternatively, a sovereign constitution could be written that essentially<br>
embodies the corporate law structures.<br>
<p>
I find the corporate government model interesting because it appears to be<br>
a relatively effective model and it is one that hasn't been discussed in<br>
great detail.  One aspect that should appeal to some on this list is that<br>
allows you to, in many ways, set up your own virtual government/society<br>
within an existing sovereign entity.  A corporation is to its shareholders<br>
what a government is to its citizens.  When implemented like this, the<br>
corporation replaces virtually all the roles of a traditional government,<br>
but without many of the negative side effects.<br>
