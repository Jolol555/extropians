Well, I just spent the day shooting with my freind, a retired Air Force Colonel,<br>
who spent 30 years in military intelligence, and is a consultant to the South<br>
Korean CIA. He told me that once when he was testifying to the Senate<br>
Intelligence  Committee, the gentleman in charge of all classification of<br>
information was testifying with him, and he told the committee that 95% of all<br>
information that is classified is done merely so as to keep from embarassing the<br>
government...<br>
<p>
This guy's conclusion after three decades in the highest levels of our nation's<br>
intelligence operation around the world, and many years since consulting with<br>
many governments, is that there is not one single government in the world that<br>
has as its prime goal to improve people lives. All governments are only concerned<br>
with is perpetuating their power and opressing the people, and everywhere he has<br>
been the biggest problem people have in life is varying levels of government<br>
dragging them down.....<br>
