ABC's "Virtual Obsession" that aired Thurs. night, 2/26/98, dumped fresh<br>
particulates into the kultursmog.  How did the producers, writers, and<br>
sponsors all let such a contradictory, jumbled mish-mash of special effects<br>
images and half-baked moralizing reach the air?  Well, they can't think<br>
straight themselves, compost-modernism has done them in.  In addition,<br>
those older guys in marketing who might still be able to think straight<br>
probably figured that with all the contradictory moral assertions, they<br>
were probably pretty much covering the highly fragmented market. <br>
Certainly, the movie took for granted that there is no consensual moral<br>
polity left anywhere on the horizon; there is no more "one nation, under<br>
God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."  Divide-and-conquer<br>
has succeeded wildly.  The movie took for granted that the viewers are<br>
sheep, incapable of sustained objective moral logic, only capable of<br>
entertaining jukebox ideas of the moment.  The disrespect for the viewers<br>
shown by serving up truly atrocious acting is obvious.  But why shouldn't<br>
they disrespect viewers who are merely machines?  The machine view is<br>
clearly predominant, in that no human character gets developed beyond a<br>
stereotypical cartoon level, but the special effects - machine art - get<br>
all the sophisticated development.  This has been Hollyweird's trend for<br>
many moons.<br>
<p>
The male scientist is, as usual, morally crippled; stereotypically male in<br>
that he only thinks with his hormones and is incapable of anything more<br>
than an adolescent "gee whiz, ain't that cool" response to the greatest<br>
scientific achievement in history.  The model is probably the producer. <br>
The husband is a dork and so is the wheelchair guy.  Their interaction is<br>
dork factor nine.  The female scientist is, as usual, morally crippled;<br>
stereotypically female in that she is a slut who only thinks of<br>
manipulating men to her own evil ends and turns sociopathic when her vain<br>
will is thwarted.  The model is probably the producer's mistress.  The wife<br>
is a painful caricature of what Hollyweird thinks of domestic bliss.  A<br>
clinical psychologist who says she's going to leave and then doesn't?  A<br>
wife who left a brilliant career to stick her head in washing machines and<br>
toilet bowls nonstop?  A brain who's a dud in the marital bed and looks<br>
like a Midwestern wreck of a woman, apparently unaware of the existence of<br>
the cosmetics industry?  But, hey, gee whiz, those computer effects were<br>
cool, y'know?  The overnight ratings amongst Generation Duh were quite<br>
respectable.<br>
<p>
Part of the contradictory manipulations is due to the inherent tension<br>
between the very large neo-luddite contingent in Hollyweird and the very<br>
large special effects technophile contingent.  The word-bursts (I can't<br>
bring myself to use "plot") alternated between muddled semi-religious<br>
jargon about souls and the sacred, and irrational claptrap about humans as<br>
machines, the mind as a computer.  The writers probably go for the<br>
mind-as-a-computer schtick because they write on a word processor, but why<br>
mention anything religious at all?  Are the neo-luddites vaguely aware of<br>
the unknown precipice we all stand on, as we begin to technologically<br>
twiddle with other human's volitional freedom?  Is the mention of religion<br>
a form of Pascal's wager, just in case we need something to guide us<br>
through the labyrinth of political decisions that lie ahead?  Certainly the<br>
father of the slut is the most cartoonishly developed of all the<br>
characters, muttering half-baked dogmas in a rigidly wooden monotone.  The<br>
writers clearly lack religious imagination and knowledge, yet feel<br>
compelled to say something religious, covering their bets.  The casting of<br>
the Man From U.N.C.L.E., an actor previously pigeon-holed into cold-blooded<br>
hired gun roles, as the token theist, was not credible.  Nor was it<br>
credible that such a morally absolute man would give a rip about a slut<br>
daughter.  Oh well, at least the writers quickly and bloodily killed him<br>
off, lest anyone think they might *really* give credence to his<br>
semi-religious utterances.<br>
<p>
Speaking of killing off, the writers at least are well attuned to one area<br>
of the zeitgeist, the cheers heard throughout neighborhoods all over the<br>
country when the judge fell down the elevator shaft were amazing!  Take<br>
note, Hollyweird, there's gold in them thar hills...<br>
<p>
Along the lines of the contradictory, allow me to be a bit technically<br>
nit-picky.  Everyone knows that due to the dendritic properties of calcium<br>
in the skull, frozen heads bounce like bowling balls, they don't shatter<br>
like ice cubes.  The lamebrain writers must've been thinking about that<br>
scene in "Terminator II" where the broken liquid nitrogen tanker shatters<br>
the motorcycle cop calcium-less terminator.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, to be in the hologram, the wheelchair must've been downloaded<br>
into the computer, also.  Did it die along with the dork?  What about<br>
non-coercion and wheelchair rights?  I mean, if humans are machines, so are<br>
wheelchairs.  How could one machine have more intrinsic value than any<br>
other (excepting my microwave oven, of course)?  If the aneurysm killed the<br>
slut scientist because it was downloaded, how could the ADA dork stand up,<br>
since the brain is contiguous with every scrap of neural tissue in the<br>
body?  The brain's motor-cortical global maps are intrinsic to volitional<br>
consciousness, how could they be summarily lobotimized without the<br>
downloaded entity ending up vegetized like Ted Kennedy's sister?<br>
<p>
It would be easy to view this as a morality tale where technology is the<br>
villain when attractive psycho-sluts get downloaded but the hero when<br>
harmless dorks get downloaded and can leave their wheelchair, an electronic<br>
version of Benny Hinn's TV faith-healing.  The real moral has to do with<br>
Hollyweird's obsession with the perfect body:  it's better to be dead than<br>
to be halt, lame or blind - I mean, crippled (or is it handicapped, or<br>
differently abled, or physically challenged; whatever the anointed's mascot<br>
is called these days).  This is standard 'culture of death' morality, any<br>
entity less than perfect - in fact, less than comfort-inducing - is<br>
preferably terminated; abortion, euthanasia, genocide all are<br>
fellow-travelers on this bus.<br>
<p>
The final analysis is that Hollyweird strung together contradictory<br>
snippets about religion, sex and death from a standard recipe, but they<br>
forgot the amount of the ingredients and the order they are supposed to go<br>
in.  The producers, writers and sponsors let it go out in that incoherent<br>
form because they think incoherently themselves, they figure they covered<br>
bases in many fragmented markets, and the special effects were, like, cool<br>
and stuff.  They all think, "whatever," because they share the machine view<br>
of humanity, the brain as computer processor, and why ought anyone care one<br>
whit about one machine over another?  They're all equally disrespected. <br>
They disrespect themselves or they couldn't have placed this junk in the<br>
public square.<br>
