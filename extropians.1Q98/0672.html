<p>
I can attest to the opportunities here. When I got out of the Air Force, I was<br>
unemployable. My skills with aircraft were not needed, as airlines and aircraft<br>
mfrs. were laying people off. I was also broke. I lived a rather scarce existence<br>
for about 3-6 months, until I was working 3 really BS jobs. A short time later, I<br>
went into business with two other guys based on a device I invented. That lasted<br>
for 5 years until the bottom fell out of the energy conservation industry in '95.<br>
Then I was again difficult to employ, but I built up the computer skills I had<br>
learned while running my business, and now I'm working for a software company,<br>
making more money than before, and learning all sorts of new stuff. I do computer<br>
consulting on the side, and am working on another invention. Change is difficult,<br>
but good, and it makes life interesting. At get togethers, I've always got lots<br>
of stories to tell because I've done a LOT of different things.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; One thing is for certain:  the government does very little to help people</i><br>
<i>&gt; work harder or make intelligent decisions.  Therefore, it should be no</i><br>
<i>&gt; surprise that the attempts of government to control poverty (by programs</i><br>
<i>&gt; like Welfare) do little to change the socio-economic status of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual involved.</i><br>
<p>
At the same time, as I've been unemployed several times, not once have I received<br>
government support. I've applied a few times, but since I'm an able bodied white<br>
male with no dependents, they always find a loophole to exclude me, and they try<br>
to make the experience so humiliating that you just want to go out and shoot<br>
yourself (which could be good or bad: if people don't like the experience, they<br>
might be more motivated to get off their asses, as I have, but the treatment<br>
could also act as a vicious cycle, keeping poor people too depressed with poor<br>
self esteem to think that they can get off their asses.)<br>
