<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; A few people on this list, myself included, have commented on taking</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; illegal research underground and possibly attempting to control</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; political movements that may counter progress.  And while it may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; futile to even try this, it has a certain undeniable appeal.  Besides,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; why do we all seem so intent on obeying the law?  Nobody's holding a</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; At least in the U.S., it is a felony to participate in a conspiracy. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you make</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; an exhortation in an e-mail that somebody else do simething illegal, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the person enetes into a discussion with and subsequently performs that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; illegal act, then you have technically committed conspiracy. I'm less</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; clear</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; on whether or not the other participants in the discussion are also guilty</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of consciracy, but they might be. In light of this, please hold such</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; discussions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; only among those who wish to be involved. Thanks.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since it isn't illegal right now for private citizens to clone, then it can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; be conspiracy to do so right now.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed, in this case. However Yak's statement was general. Clearly,it cloning is<br>
not illegal, then advocacy of cloning is not illegal and discussions<br>
are not illegal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Besides, there can be a decent case made that the federal prosecution of</i><br>
<i>&gt; public email discussions as conspiracy, if and when it becomes illegal, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; cloning in private could be found to be capricious enforcement, since the past</i><br>
<i>&gt; few years millions, if not billions of email messages have been sent across</i><br>
<i>&gt; the US, and across our internaitonal borders which contained the</i><br>
<i>&gt; RC4-3lines-PERL encryption algorythm. That they have not prosecuted one person</i><br>
<i>&gt; who engaged in this mass act of civil disobedience is a significant precedent</i><br>
<i>&gt; against their use of public mail list messages as evidence of conspiracy. That</i><br>
<i>&gt; this discussion is public, and not private, indicates that this is more of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; forum for public protest than secretive conspiracy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The Johnson and Nixon administrations prosecuted the "Chicago Seven"<br>
on criminal conspiracy charges, even  though some of them had never<br>
met or communicated with each other person-to-person. They engaged<br>
in their conspiracy using the news media. Apparently, secrecy is not<br>
a requirement. I personally thought this was a farce, but I'm not a<br>
prosecutor. I devoutly hope that e-mail discussions and all other forms<br>
of speech remain as free as possible. I'm merely pointing out the<br>
law as I (a layman) understand it.<br>
