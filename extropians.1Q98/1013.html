<i>&gt; Consider these questions:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Human Strengths</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;---------------</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;1. What are the most important human strengths?</i><br>
<p>
Intelligence, Intuition, Creativity, Critical Reflection<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;2. Why do we (or at least some of us) have these</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;strengths?</i><br>
<p>
Because we trust these strengths.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;3. Why do some of us not have these strengths?</i><br>
<p>
Because they don't trust themselves.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;4. How can these strengths be further strengthened</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and spread more widely?</i><br>
<p>
By making people understand that it's easy and profitable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;5. How can these strengths be best applied to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;improve the general "human condition?"</i><br>
<p>
By using one's own intelligence, intuition, creativity and critical<br>
reflection to spread the right memes ("right memes" are those that make<br>
people aware of their own capabilities - and once they're aware, they<br>
should spread those memes, too)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Human Weaknesses</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;----------------</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;1. What are the most important human weaknesses?</i><br>
<p>
Irresponsibility - for themselves and the world around them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;2. Why do some people suffer from these weaknesses?</i><br>
<p>
Because at first sight, it looks like the path of least resistance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;3. If applicable, why do some people not suffer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;from these weaknesses?</i><br>
<p>
Because they know that their life is really much easier if they don't<br>
give in to irresponsibility. They prefer making their own choices<br>
instead of letting others make decisions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;4. What are the consequences of these weaknesses?</i><br>
<p>
Failure. Not always, but quite often irresponsibility lets people become<br>
addicts (any sort of addiction is probably the perfect state of<br>
irresponsibility).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;5. How can people overcome these weaknesses?</i><br>
<p>
Give them responsibility (suppose your name is King John "Government").<br>
Basically, they just have to make that one first decision that they will<br>
make their own decisions. They need to practice discipline a lot (that's<br>
probably the hardest part), they need to educate themselves - more<br>
knowledge will make decisions somewhat easier.<br>
<p>
Actually, I think the major problem is finding out about one's<br>
weaknesses (whatever they are) - consciously understanding what kind of<br>
weakness one is dealing with, and consciously working on improving<br>
oneself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Originally, I was only going to ask about weaknesses.</i><br>
<p>
Not a good idea in my point of view - instead of looking for weaknesses,<br>
I'd rather look for strengths. It's much easier for people to try to<br>
improve their strengths than fighting their weaknesses. Even considering<br>
something a "weakness" is demotivating already - if you look at the same<br>
thing from the perspective "ok, what have we here, I can still be<br>
somewhat better at that", you've almost got it done...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I need to write a report on the "basic human problem."</i><br>
<p>
Sounds like quite an interesting challenge - good luck!<br>
<p>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt; I mentioned my idea of asking "weakness questions" on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Internet to a teacher friend.  She suggested that</i><br>
<i>&gt; I should also ask about strengths.</i><br>
<p>
That was a very good idea - you'll find whatever you look for. When you<br>
look for weakness, or any "negative" things - you'll find them, and the<br>
more you look, the more you'll find. Especially when looking at people,<br>
this is quite tricky - personally, I tend to have quite a negative<br>
opinion of the "general public", but the more I look for positive<br>
things, the more I find - the more I can learn (I don't have any<br>
interest in learning negative things).<br>
<p>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt; An important consideration is my thinking that progress</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the direction of greater freedom could be accelerated</i><br>
<i>&gt; if more freedom activists could identify their greatest</i><br>
<i>&gt; strengths and find out how to best utilize them.</i><br>
<p>
Definitely - the more people actively spread the right memes, the<br>
better!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It would also be useful to us to identify important</i><br>
<i>&gt; weaknesses and find out how to overcome them.</i><br>
<p>
Hm... same as above. If you identify the skill contrary to a weakness,<br>
you're already half-way there...<br>
<p>
later,<br>
