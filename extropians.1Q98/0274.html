U.S. scientist poised to clone humans, radio says<br>
<p>
A Chicago-area scientist is poised to start experiments on<br>
cloning human beings to create babies for infertile couples,<br>
National Public Radio (NPR) reported Tuesday. It said Richard<br>
Seed, a physicist who has done fertility research in the past,<br>
was proposing setting up a clinic that would clone babies for<br>
would-be parents. NPR said Seed had been negotiating with a<br>
Chicago area clinic, which it declined to name, that had all the<br>
equipment needed to try the procedure. Seed could not be<br>
immediately reached for comment.<br>

Nothing worth doing is completed in our lifetime; <br>
therefore we must be saved by hope.<br>
Nothing true or beautiful or good makes sense in any immediate <br>
historical context; therefore we must be saved by faith. <br>
Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone;<br>
therefore we are saved by love. <br>
