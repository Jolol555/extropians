PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         <br>
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News<br>
Number 363 March 23, 1998   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein<br>

NANO-ELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS (NEMS) will be<br>
faster, smaller, and more energy efficient than the present day<br>
micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), an example of which is<br>
the accelerometer that triggers airbags in cars.  At last week's<br>
American Physical Society meeting in Los Angeles, Michael<br>
Roukes of Caltech (626-395-2916) described the leading edge of<br>
NEMS research.  Using lithography and etching techniques, he has<br>
fabricated a 10x10x100-nm suspended beam of silicon which<br>
oscillates at an estimated frequency of 7 GHz (although no detector<br>
can yet "hear" the vibrations). Such a resonator will eventually be<br>
used in microwave signal processing (for modulating or filtering<br>
signals).  The speed and stability of nanoscopic silicon arms might<br>
even facilitate the advent of some new kind of Babbage-type<br>
computer in which mechanical levers once again serve as processing<br>
or memory elements.(In other words, a machine with "moving<br>
parts" may not be so bad.)  Silicon structures in this size regime will<br>
also be used as cantilever probes in magnetic resonance force<br>
microscopy (the goal being atomic-resolution NMR imaging; see<br>
Update 313) and as calorimeters for the study of quantized heat<br>
pulses (Update 320).  Roukes' colleague, Andrew Cleland of UC<br>
Santa Barbara, described a paddle-shaped silicon structure (whose<br>
smallest lateral feature was 200 nm) for detecting very small<br>
amounts of electrical charge, with a potential application in high-<br>
sensitivity photodetection (see also Nature, 12 March 1998).  At the<br>
same APS session, Rex Beck of Harvard reported a NEMS force<br>
sensor which integrates a field effect transistor into a scanned probe<br>
microscope. The present sensitivities are about 10 angstroms for<br>
displacement and 5 pico-Newtons for force (per square root of the<br>
frequency), but Beck expects improvements as the size of the device<br>
shrinks. The smallest transistor-probe structure Beck reported had<br>
dimensions of 3x2 microns x 140 nm.<br>
<p>
DNA WIRES, only 12 microns long and 100 nm wide, have been<br>
strung between gold electrodes.  DNA is attractive as a potential<br>
component in nano-design applications because of its molecular-<br>
recognition, self-assembly, and mechanical properties.  DNA does<br>
not, however, conduct electricity. In an experiment at the Technion-<br>
Israel Institute of Technology, researchers first spanned the gap<br>
between two electrodes with a tiny DNA causeway and then<br>
exposed the structure to silver ions, which made a conducting path. <br>
