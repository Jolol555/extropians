rules" -- can be found at &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm</a>&gt;,<br>

In 1990, Max More, cofounder of the Extropy movement<br>
(see &lt;<a href="http://www.extropy.com/">http://www.extropy.com/</a>&gt;), wrote the article<br>
'DEEP ANARCHY -- AN ELIMINATIVIST VIEW OF "THE STATE"'<br>
-- see &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
This article includes, in my opinion, some of the steps<br>
one might take in the early stages of clearing deep<br>
pemes from one's mind.<br>
<p>
To me, "Deep Anarchists" are Anarchists who have cleared<br>
all or most deep pemes from their minds.  They're always<br>
alert to the possibility that there might be more statist<br>
baggage at the deepest intellectual or conceptual levels<br>
that needs to be eliminated.<br>
<p>
In 'The Ego &amp; Its Own' Max Stirner wrote:  "The decision<br>
having once been made not to let oneself be imposed on any<br>
longer by the extant and palpable, little scruple was felt<br>
about revolting against the existing State or overturning<br>
the existing laws; but to sin against the *idea* of the<br>
State, not to submit to the *idea* of law, who would have<br>
dared that?"<br>
<p>
Stirner pointed the way to becoming a Deep Anarchist.<br>

<i>&gt;Hi Freespeak,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I speculate that the power, survival, and expansion of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;coercive political systems depend on "subjects" acting</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;more or less in blind obedience to their peme programs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;To the extent that individuals free themselves from their</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;peme programs, coercive political systems lose their</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;power over these individuals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;I agree --</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And I can't agree: if individuals free themselves from their 'peme'  </i><br>
<i>&gt;programs, they receive their power to reject political systems. The  </i><br>
<i>&gt;political systems don't lose their power over these individuals,</i><br>
<i>&gt;because the other individuals don't free themselves from their 'peme'  </i><br>
<i>&gt;programs. 'Let the king alone, and his power will leave him!' by</i><br>
<i>&gt;La Boethie mean: if *all* individuals free themselves from their</i><br>
<i>&gt;'peme'programs, coercive political systems lose their power over</i><br>
<i>&gt;these individuals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
The notion of being "personally powerless compared<br>
to the overwhelming power of "the state" or "the<br>
government"" is a near-surface peme many subject<br>
themselves to needlessly.<br>
<p>
Also relevant here is the theme expressed by Davidson<br>
&amp; Rees-Mogg in their excellent 'The Sovereign Individual':<br>
As a result of technological advance, the returns on<br>
violence by bureaucrats diminishes, reducing their<br>
power.  Politicians and bureaucrats apply violence to<br>
earn returns in the forms of obedience, money ("taxes"),<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
In my personal case, through the application of Freedom<br>
Technology, the returns politicians and bureaucrats get<br>
from me are negligible.  The power they have over me is<br>
extremely limited, largely because of my understaning of<br>
their thinking and behavior, my ability to operate outside<br>
their systems, the advance of technology, and because I've<br>
cleared all the harmful pemes I've been able to find from<br>
my mind.<br>
<p>
However, because of deeply-entrenched pemes, inertia,<br>
and tradition, many freedom lovers still grossly<br>
underestimate their own power while also grossly<br>
overestimating the power of politicians and bureaucrats.<br>
<p>
Centuries after the so-called "Roman Empire" collapsed,<br>
many people continued to behave as if "it" still existed<br>
and continued to obey "it."  Because of "belief inertia"<br>
and pemes, we can expect a similar phenomenon in our era.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is a problem attending massive withdrawal of tacit consent and </i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's a bit of a conundrum, this!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
If the "withdrawing group" is largely unorganized,<br>
they maximize their power as individuals.  Most of<br>
us need only relatively small support groups to<br>
live free to a considerable degree.<br>

As far as I know, there are only about a dozen Deep<br>
Anarchists in the world.  Most of them are subscribers<br>
to the Advanced Freedom Solutions list.  To subscribe:<br>

the number of Deep Anarchists might be to publish a<br>

<i>&gt;Your articles are memetic... and they're certainly political...  but</i><br>
<i>&gt;somehow you seem to think that you're clearing away pemes rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt;replacing them with your own.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your meme, which happens to be political, has several traits which make it</i><br>
<i>&gt;fairly adaptable.  It appeals to other deep memes, notably freedom (in this</i><br>
<i>&gt;case, from pemes), self-ownership, and levels of development.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt;circumvents serious criticism with Peme Rule 12:  "Any human who attempts</i><br>
<i>&gt;to question, attack, or expose any deep peme shall be ignored, ridiculed,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or vilified by other humans."  It emphasizes the malicious nature of pemes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;thus harnessing the very deep meme of self-preservation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Consider this:  if you were to erase all political memes from your mind</i><br>
<i>&gt;tomorrow, you would have no political opinion, because you would have no</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas about politics.  No freedom thoughts, no authoritarian thoughts, no</i><br>
<i>&gt;thoughts at all about government and/or its value to society (if any).</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's what it means to have no memes:  you have no ideas.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Freedom is a peme, too, ya know.  It's especially adaptable because its</i><br>
<i>&gt;meaning is so ambiguous, yet it seems to appeal to everyone.  We get</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom of speech, freedom of choice, freedom from choice, peme-freedom,</i><br>
<i>&gt;meme-freedom, free-markets, economic freedom (a term sadly appropriated by</i><br>
<i>&gt;communists), degrees of freedom, and free energy...  all from the same word.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So I put it to you again:  you're selling a meme, and it's political.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;conclude that you're selling me a peme.  You're not crazy... or even wrong,</i><br>
<i>&gt;per se.  But you aren't eliminating pemes...  you're just replacing them</i><br>
<i>&gt;with deeper ones which aren't open to criticism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(If you now go on to tell me that I operate at peme freedom level 1, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;will have missed the point of this post.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
As "Who Is John Galt?" &lt;johngalt@veil.net&gt; indicated earlier,<br>
there is a tongue-in-cheek element in my "peme rules!"<br>
<p>
Earlier I provided some definitions:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Pemes are political memes.  They consist of ideas, concepts,</i><br>
<i>&gt;phrases, and terms, the use of which increases the power of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "masters" who operate coercive political systems; while</i><br>
<i>&gt;their use reduces the power of the "subjects" of coercive</i><br>
<i>&gt;political systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are surface pemes and deep pemes.  Surface pemes are</i><br>
<i>&gt;relatively easy to identify and invalidate.  An example of</i><br>
<i>&gt;a surface peme is "mandate from the people."  This is used</i><br>
<i>&gt;by politicians and bureaucrats to "justify" their coercive</i><br>
<i>&gt;actions.  It increases their power.  "Subjects" who accept</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "mandate from the people" peme, effectively reduce their</i><br>
<i>&gt;own power because they "authorize" politicians and bureaucrats</i><br>
<i>&gt;to take coercive actions against "subjects."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Deep pemes are much more difficult to identify as such and</i><br>
<i>&gt;to invalidate.  Deep pemes are generally accepted as valid</i><br>
<i>&gt;by practically all people, including freedom lovers.  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt;try to question, attack, or invalidate a deep peme, most</i><br>
<i>&gt;people will think you're crazy.</i><br>
<p>
And:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Two questions may help us identify the pemes:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(1) Which words/concepts -- if I accept and use</i><br>
<i>&gt;them the way most people habitually do -- place</i><br>
<i>&gt;me at a disadvantage in relation to the political</i><br>
<i>&gt;"masters?"  (Which words tend to increase the power</i><br>
<i>&gt;of politicians and bureaucrats, while reducing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;power of their victims?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(2) Which words, if the political "masters" didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;have them nor any equivalents for them, would</i><br>
<i>&gt;dramatically reduce the power of politicians and</i><br>
<i>&gt;bureaucrats?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
So it's not all political memes that need to be<br>
eliminated.  It's those that satisfy the above<br>
definitions and questions.  It's a matter of<br>
replacing pemes harmful to you with pemes more<br>
useful to you -- pemes that increase your personal<br>
power, while decreasing the power of "political<br>
systems" over you.<br>

<i>&gt;I would suggest that the question of "pemes" be reframed. We have no</i><br>
<i>&gt;"political genes" as such --- until approximately 10,000 years ago,</i><br>
<i>&gt;our ancestors lived in VERY small groups -- 50 was probably a huge</i><br>
<i>&gt;group until quite recently. And 10,000 years is a VERY short time</i><br>

<i>&gt;time Homo Sapiens has been around. This means that any genetic basis</i><br>
<i>&gt;for political manipulation must have evolved in the pre-history period</i><br>
<i>&gt;and been designed for navigation in VERY small groups.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Look to your own experiences in small family, etc. groups for clues</i><br>
<i>&gt;to what these genetic tendancies might be.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would suggest that what has happened is that the political sub-groups,</i><br>
<i>&gt;political cliques, and those individuals with "hierarchical tendancies,"</i><br>
<i>&gt;easily kept under control in small groups, have hijacked these small-group</i><br>
<i>&gt;tendancies and learned to manipulate the rest of us networkers using them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The most obious example is the constant excuse for everything from</i><br>
<i>&gt;government agents killing kids at Waco to protect them from alleged</i><br>
<i>&gt;molestation to FBI agents posing as 13 year-old girls in chat rooms:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   "Bob Dole says that if you listen to President Bill Clinton speak</i><br>
<i>&gt;   for five minutes, you will hear him use the word "children" at</i><br>
<i>&gt;   least fifteen times."  -Nadine Strossen, President ACLU, July 5,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   1996, addressing the Libertarian Party Presidential Nominating</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Convention, CSPAN I, ~12:30 EST A</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are many other examples of the government cliques learning to</i><br>
<i>&gt;hijack our small-group instincts to manipulate us. To the extent that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the general population buys the con, we freedom lovers are going up</i><br>
<i>&gt;against human hard-wired programming -- and that's usually a losing</i><br>
<i>&gt;proposition.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;When you expose the deepest cons, not easy since they are intertwined</i><br>
<i>&gt;with our deepest group instincts, people often recognize government </i><br>
<i>&gt;cliques as the enemies and parasites they are.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One reason we freedom oriented folks get so frustrated is that we believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;the version of the "common man" presented in the media, and toward which</i><br>
<i>&gt;the media must, for economic reasons, direct their programming. I've rarely</i><br>
<i>&gt;met such a "common man!" People are much better than that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;At any rate, if you redefine "pemes" as mostly hijacked small-group</i><br>
instincts,<br>
<i>&gt;I would suggest you will be more likely to be able to map what's really</i><br>
<i>&gt;happening, and deal with it much more effectively.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Pemes are not "political genes."  They are political<br>
*memes*.  See the definitions and the two questions<br>
above.  Another term for the combination of harmful<br>
pemes and the peme rules is NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic<br>
Political Illusion Complex -- see<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
Deep pemes are the most fundamental political enemies<br>
and mind parasites.  As long as freedom lovers continue<br>
to perpetuate and spread pemes, they help to reinforce<br>
and perpetuate "political systems" at the deepest and<br>
most powerful level.  Hence I formulated peme rule 19:<br>
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary<br>
peme purveyors) communicate -- although<br>
they may question, attack, and expose a<br>
few surface pemes -- they shall make a<br>
special effort to use deep pemes in their<br>
language -- in order to maximize peme<br>
survival and propagation."<br>
<p>
Robert Ringer, in 'Restoring the American Dream,' in<br>
Chapter 8 -- "Keeping It All in Place" -- indicates<br>
how "political systems" are kept in place primarily<br>
by pemes.  He exposes many surface pemes and a few<br>
deep pemes.  But he doesn't go all the way to Deep<br>
Anarchy.  He still communicates according to peme<br>
rule 19, above.  Nevertheless, he does open the door<br>
to Deep Anarchy.  'Restoring the American Dream' --<br>
which I highly recommend -- is available from<br>

In order to clear harmful pemes from your mind,<br>
it helps not only to clear from your mind the<br>
notion that concepts prescribe, but also the<br>
notion that they describe.  This is related to<br>
the illusion that "words have meanings," as<br>
opposed to "people have meanings for words."<br>
<p>
In themselves, concepts don't describe.  However,<br>
people can use concepts to describe to others,<br>
provided they have similar meanings for the same<br>
concepts.<br>

How much power to coerce and control would politicians<br>

words?<br>
