This is not a new idea, simply the old cosmological constant.  Einstein<br>
found that his new theory of general relativity predicted that the<br>
universe would be expanding or contracting (or expanding then contracting).<br>
Since it was thought to be static, he found that he had to modify the<br>
equations.  Rather than all forces being caused by matter/energy, he<br>
had to assume that there was an inherent force in the vacuum itself.<br>
This could counter the attractive force of gravity and make the universe<br>
stable.<br>
<p>
Later, when the universe was found to be expanding, he made his famous<br>
comment about this being his greatest blunder, otherwise he could have<br>
claimed the prediction of an expanding universe as a success of general<br>
relativity.  (BTW it's kind of curious that one man's decision can change<br>
whether a theory is considered a success or not.  Why isn't "GR minus<br>
CC" considered to have successfully predicted the universe's expansion,<br>
regardless of whether Einstein chose to present it that way?  Do theories<br>
make predictions, or people?)<br>
<p>
The recent measurements show that the rate that the universe is expanding<br>
appears to be speeding up, while GR would predict that it is slowing<br>
down due to the attractive effects of gravity.  This would indicate that<br>
there is a CC which is so strong that it is overcoming the attraction due<br>
to the mass.<br>
<p>
Recall a month ago that there were reports that there was insufficient<br>
mass to slow the universe's expansion.  I believe that was based on<br>
similar measurements to these more recent results.  If there actually is<br>
a strong CC, then we can no longer conclude that there is a lack of mass;<br>
there may be plenty of mass, but it is simply that the CC is stronger.<br>
This could imply that the universe is spatially closed (if you go far<br>
enough in one direction you come back where you started) but will still<br>
never collapse back on itself.<br>
<p>
Most physicists really dislike the CC, which appears as an ad hoc fudge<br>
factor in the equations of GR.  I'm sure there will be a lot of work done<br>
to try to disprove the recent results, or find a way to fit them into a<br>
more elegant theory.<br>
