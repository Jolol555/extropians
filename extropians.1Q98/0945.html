A strong suggestion ... go root out a copy of FUTURE SHOCK by Alvin<br>
Toffler, pub. 1970 or thereabouts. Read it.<br>
<p>
Yes, the book is obsolescent. Yes, things have moved on a long way since<br>
it was written (and published). Many of the themes in it seem dated,<br>
quaint, or just plain silly. But it lends a valuable perspective --<br>
namely, it shows what attitudes to technology being 'out of control'<br>
were like in 1970. People were feeling bewildered because of the rate<br>
of change of technology back then. The anti-science shtick was visible<br>
already. Things have accelerated a lot since 1970, and some new themes<br>
have emerged, but the broad picture seems to me to be consistent, and<br>
it can be summed up quite simply: most people can't adapt easily to<br>
change.<br>
<p>
As far as the central concept -- technology being 'out of control' -- I<br>
suppose the only valid response is that it was never _under_ control in<br>
the first place. Technological progress this century has almost all been<br>
driven by market forces, which are blind to long-term prospects (else<br>
we wouldn't have had leaded petrol or CFCs in aerosol cannisters -- or<br>
microprocessors or aeroplanes for that matter). Moreover, government<br>
policy regulators might _want_ to regulate the social impact of new<br>
technologies (I doubt they could give a damn for technology in isolation,<br>
were it not for the effect on their constituents), but they can't predict<br>
where the next outbreak will occur. (If they could, they'd be investing<br>
in it themselves, as individuals.)<br>
<p>
Have fun telling 'em it's time to surrender ...<br>
