&lt;trivial trolling/sarcastic crap elided&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I never understand the whole Creativity vs. Science thing, surely the</i><br>
<i>&gt;act of science is creative and is an art form.  Taking a look at a</i><br>
<i>&gt;dictionary, art is described as "imitative or imaginative... in which</i><br>
<i>&gt;skill can be expressed."  It doesn't exclude science until, "certain</i><br>
<i>&gt;branches of learning as distinct from sciences" which kinda rains on</i><br>
<i>&gt;my parade.</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;So here's the BIG question:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1) What is the difference between science and art anyway?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Pish.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;--Wax</i><br>
<p>
&lt;Metacomment, personal, to Wax; all others, please ignore: <br>
Wax, if I'm going to bother thinking about what you say, I'm going to have<br>
to assume you're not just listening to yourself talk when you ask those<br>
sorts of questions. Should I invest my time elsewhere?&gt;<br>
<p>
Well, science as humans practice it includes the active discovery of "real"<br>
things not immediately evident. For "real", I use Dick's Definition: "what<br>
doesn't go away when you stop believing in it". The active discovery part<br>
can involve creativity in design, hypothesis and perhaps other things.<br>
<p>
So my working model is, roughly: The way humans do science, there is art<br>
involved. _But the art is not in the "scio" (~="knowledge")_. The art is<br>
value added by the human practitioners. <br>
<p>
A dry collecting of facts, as by a weak-weak AI, possibly still having some<br>
"activity" (e.g., "trying" things, but brute force) _might_ count as "doing<br>
science". I consider the art content of such activity to be vanishingly small.<br>
<p>
So mooshing art and science together appears to me to be of low utility.<br>
<p>
Art, among its (not-science) distinguishing characteristics, appears to be<br>
the way we humans create nonzero sum, win-win situations. While such<br>
situations might be considered to exist outside the influence of humans,<br>
new ones don't seem to crop up rapidly "in the wild". Science, so far as I<br>
know, does not create these situations, although knowledge has power to<br>
contribute value to them. Science is supposed to be value-free; art is<br>
about nothing _but_ value. Thus engineering is art, and engineering a lab<br>
setup is art, and (perhaps) making sense of the data is art.<br>
<p>
But the data compiled in the CRC handbook, or even the Encyclopedia<br>
Britannica, is not art, it's just (we hope) valid information. That has<br>
value, of course, but it's a static pattern of value. Art is about dynamic<br>
patterns of value.<br>
<p>
Of course, that win-win vs value-free thingy could just mean that we are<br>
all only  kidding ourselves about win-win; the scientific universe is<br>
pretty much zero-sum. Alternately, it could be evidence for "As a Man<br>
Thinketh". Or both at once.<br>
<p>
Go figure.<br>
