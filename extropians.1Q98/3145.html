<i>&gt; &gt;  I hope my criticism didn't convince you that debating fundamental ideas</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; beliefs (rather than promote solidarity within your side of the debate, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; many arguments seem designed for), you need to understand why they reach</i><br>

<i>&gt; You make good points, Peter. Rants-although they are fun-rarely convince</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone of anything. But a little rightuous anger isn't all bad, is it? I</i><br>
<i>&gt; love reading some of the arguments of the radical abolitionists of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; early 1800's. They called slavery evil and slaveholders evil people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's exhilerating to read them. They didn't make utilitarian arguments</i><br>
<i>&gt; against slavery, but they did have some effect on public opinion. Would</i><br>
<i>&gt; they have done better with an economic analysis of slavery which would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have shown that it made the country as a whole and the slaves, but not</i><br>
<i>&gt; the individual slaveholders, economically worse off? </i><br>
<p>
Why not point out that in the long run it made the individual <br>
slaveholders worse off?<br>
