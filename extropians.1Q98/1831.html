With respect, _my_ well being is not my ultimate goal. I have loftier<br>
aspirations. I'd rather uplift the whole race than beat them to the finish<br>
line. :)<br>
<p>
Also, your argument about crisis driving solutions is indeed a<br>
characteristic of human action patterns. I suggest it support's de Bono's<br>
rubric that "the primary purpose of thinking [in terms of the mass of<br>
humanity--MMB] is to abolish thinking [and get back to the comfort zone<br>
ASAP--MMB]".<br>
<p>
Trotsky and many terrorcrats agree. That doesn't make you wrong, but it<br>
does mean that you should take a close look at who your eschatological<br>
bedfellows are.<br>
<p>
Me, I plan to develop the field of _Elective_ Eschatology. :)<br>

<p>
Very well: I declare that my well-being is influenced positively by<br>
increased diversity in my environment. Prove to me that I err. :)<br>
<p>
I would argue that everything else is *not* a tool--it is _raw materials_;<br>
but some of it is reserves, and some of those are raw material for<br>
experiences that I can't have if it is destroyed (the Grand Canyon, Mount<br>
Fuji, Jack Russell Terrier puppies, pet ferrets, potential lovers,<br>
Barringer Meteor Crater, my wonderful nieces and nephews, etc. etc.).<br>
<p>
If everything else is a tool, then all you are is a user.<br>
<p>
Go ahead, prove I'm wrong. :)<br>
<p>
Peace,<br>
