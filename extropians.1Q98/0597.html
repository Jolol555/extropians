<i>&gt; Date:          Sun, 11 Jan 1998 16:29:05 -0800</i><br>
<i>&gt; From:          Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure how to take into account the fact that different models</i><br>
<i>&gt; may allow for the creation of life only with some probability.  My</i><br>
<i>&gt; preference would be to consider models in which the creation of life</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a certainty.  Then you are comparing apples to apples when you count</i><br>
<i>&gt; the size of the theory.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think there would be any problem factoring in the <br>
consideration that some models just probabilistically imply the <br>
creation of life. That's a fairly simple technical move. What is <br>
philosophically more tricky, however, is to decide what to do about <br>
the fact that different models would have different numbers different <br>
types of living things. Would my existence be more probable given the <br>
universe contains many observers than given it contains few <br>
observers? The assumtion that it would be more probable if the <br>
universe contains many observers is the Self-indication axiom. In my <br>
paper on the Carter-Leslie Doomsday argument, I give some arguments <br>
in favour of the negation of the Self-indication axiom. The bad thing <br>
about holding the negation true, though, is that it makes it hard to <br>
see how to escape the conclusion of the Doomsday argument.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Two possible theories, as I mentioned, are first that you create all</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible universes with all different variations on the parameters</i><br>
<i>&gt; we observe.  This is probably a pretty simple theory.</i><br>
<p>
The problem with this theory is that our univers is not what we <br>
should expect it to be if this theory were true. If all locally <br>
possible worlds are instantiated eqully numerously, then we should <br>
not expect to find ourselves in one that is so highly ordered as <br>
ours. For every possible world like this one, there are countless <br>
ones where pink elephants sometimes materialize out of nowhere or <br>
random  blue blobs form over houses whose street addresses are prime <br>
numbers. If all these possible worlds were actual, then why are we <br>
not in one of these irregular ones?<br>
