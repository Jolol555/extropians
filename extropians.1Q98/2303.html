&lt;&lt; There may be a<br>
 shortage, but not enough of one to increase the $incentive for students to<br>
 choose a high-tech career over other options.  Or even for experienced<br>
 engineers to remain engineers.  Elite? Hardly.  And who can say that they<br>
 should make more than some foreigner of equal skills?  I can't justify a<br>
 foreign hiring cap even though it's to my short-term benefit.<br>

 There has never been a talent shortage, just a shortage of cheap talent.  No<br>
 shortage of cheap, crafty businessmen. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
FYI:....this article could have just as easily been about truck<br>
drivers.(foreign national hiring cap.  Low wages.  Perceived Nationwide<br>
shortage)  All the essential points apply.  Perhaps there is a fundamental<br>
principal rearing it's ugly head here?<br>
