revenge, I<br>
<i>&gt; call it evolution in action.</i><br>
<p>
Any form of justice (imprisonment, death penalty, lynching, shunning,<br>
etc.) has two additional functions: <br>
<p>
A) They impose the idea that the "crime" is unjust which, although it<br>
may act as mild deterrent, also leads people to believe that the crime<br>
is "wrong" and "shouldn't happen" which hinders their want to defend<br>
themselves.  We have been made to believe that criminal behaviour<br>
isn't meant to happen, the problem is just because we say something<br>
isn't meant to happen it doesn't go away.  Our legal system relies<br>
solely on the blind faith of all people in the system - you have to<br>
abide by these laws, and hope that everyone else does the same.<br>
<p>
B) They cause more of the behaviour that has been deemed "criminal" in<br>
the first place.  Enforcing law creates enough lawlessness to break<br>
the system.<br>
<p>
Justice is the need for revenge - when someone commits a crime against<br>
you, what reason do you have to contact the police?  The crime has<br>
been committed, and unless the assailant has taken something<br>
irreplaceable you have little or no reason (other than revenge) to do<br>
anything.<br>
