The evidence you site doesn't seem to me to provide strong support for<br>
rejecting caloric restriction for human life extension. Two reasons:<br>
<p>
(1) Simply comparing BMI (Body Mass Index?) to death rate can be<br>
misleading. There are millions of people who die of cancer and other<br>
wasting diseases who lose weight and die with a lower BMI. It doesn't seem<br>
like the study allowed for that.<br>
<p>
(2) Apparently smoking cigarettes reduces appetite. I would expect smokers,<br>
especially heavy smokers, to have a lowe BMI and to die earlier, on<br>
average, of heart disease, cancer, and other diseases.<br>
<p>
(3) I suspect that most or many of those who have a low BMI and who don't<br>
live as long, may not have maintained the high nutrition diet specified by<br>
caloric restriction advocates. Low calorie intake with low nutrient intake<br>
is not claimed to extended life.<br>

Thoughts?<br>
