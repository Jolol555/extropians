        <br>
<p>
I can't prove I wasn't at the scene of most murders, neither can you.<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
You seem to think that what's relevant and what is not is a simple matter to<br>
determine, it's not, not in criminal investigation and not in scientific<br>
research. In the real world when you're confronted with a puzzle you always<br>
have far more information than you can deal with, and much of it is<br>
contradictory. It's easy to see that part of the information must be wrong,<br>
but what part? Knowing what data to ignore is one of the keys to creativity<br>
and it's not easy, if it was home PC's running on DOS would be winning Nobel<br>
Prizes. They're not.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The central justice computer simply </i><br>
<p>
<p>
There is nothing simple about finding the truth, it's hard work and it takes <br>
a brain, that's what the organ is for.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;presents all the facts of a particular case in a comprehensive</i><br>
<i>        &gt;matter. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's a matter of opinion, some will say something is a fact, others will say<br>
it's a fancy. And the facts are never comprehensive, the holes must be filled<br>
in with conjecture. There is a name for this procedure, judgment, and it<br>
takes intelligence that PC's don't have yet.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If the points of the prosecution haven't been refuted, then the</i><br>
<i>        &gt;conclusion is simple: guilty. It's basically the same system we use</i><br>
<i>        &gt;today, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not where I live, and not where I want to live.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;only a guilty person would be nervous if the police brought him in</i><br>
<i>        &gt;for questioning [...]  like dripping water on forehead -- doesn't</i><br>
<i>        &gt;leave a mark and is extremely effective. [...]  There is a clear</i><br>
<i>        &gt;limit to this process (say a week or two). If there still are no</i><br>
<i>        &gt;results the suspect is released (and monitored) while the police</i><br>
<i>        &gt;re-evaluate the case.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Guilty or innocent it makes no difference, when your police knock on my door<br>
in the middle of the night I would feel utter terror. I would also feel<br>
hopeless despair, because I'd know that my nightmare is only beginning and<br>
will never end this side of the grave. If I'm lucky I will undergo two weeks<br>
of Chinese water torture and then be released, for a while. My ordeal could be<br>
repeated many times and at any time. If I'm unlucky I will be painfully and<br>
horribly tortured by skilled professionals until death finally sets me free.<br>
Do you really find it hard to understand why anybody and everybody would be<br>
more than nervous when police bring them in?<br>
                                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;if you can beat the lie detector that doesn't mean you can go home</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No kidding. After seeing the inside of one of your torture chambers few would<br>
ever go home again.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>        &gt;although it can be used as minor supporting evidence to your</i><br>
<i>        &gt;innocence.</i><br>
<p>
And major supporting evidence of my guilt if I fail no doubt.<br>
                                                             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If the servants of justice really thought you were innocent they</i><br>
<i>        &gt;wouldn't have arrested you in the first place, now would they?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Your faith in the intelligence and integrity of polatitions, the judges<br>
they appoint, and other such servants of justice is touching but not entirely<br>
realistic.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the slanderer should _prove beyond reasonable doubt_ in a court of</i><br>
<i>        &gt;law that the accusations (slander) are true</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The court can issue any decision it likes on the truth or falsehood of a<br>
book and it would not change my opinion of it in the slightest. The slanderer<br>
should prove beyond reasonable doubt to the reader (not to a court) that his<br>
statements are true, if he fails the slanderer is simply Ignored.<br>
            <br>
<i>        &gt;Is this so unreasonable????</i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Words _can_ hurt people directly </i><br>
                              <br>
Then hurt them back the same way, with words.<br>
