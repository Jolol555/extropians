Darl'n Nick!  I love this idea!  Especially the capitalize part!  <br>
<p>
Yes, there are many strong, confident extropian transhuman women, to be<br>
sure.  We can find admirable examples on this list as well as in the in the<br>
news, media and writings.  Check our Wendy McElroy, Carla Sinclair and Celia<br>
Pearce whose books ring of transhumanity. And, Judith Lewis whose writings<br>
on technology hit the headlines. Not to mention Linda Chamberlain who<br>
co-founded Alcor Foundation, the leading cryonics organization. And, Amara<br>
Graps, a favored media-alert astronomer.  Also, there are Chris Peterson and<br>
Pattie Maas whose spear-heading techno-know-now set the pace.  Then there's<br>
Sandy Stone - an exemplar transgender lady who peaks the international<br>
conference circuit.  Let's not forget Tanya Jones, an Extropy Institute<br>
Director who organizes projects at the Foresight Institute. Also, Sarah Marr<br>
whose transhuman savvy has won many a debate, and Kathryn Aegis whose<br>
knowledge about genders is formidable.  And of course Nadia Reed who is an<br>
accomplished artist and well-known extropians Carol Shaw, Kennita Watson,<br>
Ailing Freeman and Sunah Caroline Cherwin who founded the zine "Slippery<br>
When Wet!"<br>
<p>
Shall I go on?<br>
<p>
And "Dr." Fiorella Terenze's accomplishments and forever glamour and media<br>
attention has been an uplift to anyone enthusiastic about astro-physics.  Or<br>
Regina Pancake whose special effects company produces the designs for<br>
Hollywood's major science fiction films!<br>
<p>
And Lee Close, who in the 1970's was a top Hollywood beauty and SF film<br>
actress, and how writes about transhuman beauty and practices it as well!<br>
<p>
OH!  I'm out of breath!<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
