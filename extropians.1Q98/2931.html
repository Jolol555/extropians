<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; You should look at the political arena as more of an x/y coordinate system,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I would argue that it has a potentially infinite number of dimensions. Political</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; decisions are rarely made on the basis of one or two variables.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sure, but as a general axiom, most issues are either a matter of social freedom or</i><br>
<i>&gt; economic freedom, or a combination thereof, or can be framed within that system.</i><br>
<p>
I thought we were trying to transcend all of this dualist<br>
nonsense? People find it incredibly easy to separate reality into<br>
"us" and "them", "good" and "bad" etc.  This doesn't make it<br>
accurate, merely convenient.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; It also</i><br>
<i>&gt; delineates between merely 'conservative' and 'liberal' labels which are often  painted</i><br>
<i>&gt; with rather broad brushes, so much so that in many cases, parties are insulted to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; under the same roof as another given the same label. An American Libertarian is about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the furthest you can get from a Nazi, yet both are labeled as 'right wing'. Populists</i><br>
<i>&gt; have more in common with Nazis than Libertarians do, yet Populists are frequenly given</i><br>
<i>&gt; the liberal label (except in the case of Pat Buchanan, who proved the similarity between</i><br>
<i>&gt; the two messages).</i><br>
<p>
My impression of this list is that it is populated by a majority<br>
of people who either consider themselves superior to the common<br>
herd, or are trying to attain a position of superiority (I make<br>
no moral arguments for or against the word "superior", it's just<br>
a label), so the fact that most people do something doesn't<br>
really do a lot to convince me that this is the way to operate in<br>
general. Quite the opposite, in fact.<br>
<p>
I understand what you are saying, it just strikes me as<br>
sophistry, isall.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Really, funny, the native Americans might have something to say about the idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; that natural selection doesn't apply to cultural evolution, especially the dead</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; ones. So might the Nazis, the Communists, and today, the French, as their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; uncompetetive little culture is getting overrun by Americanization (as most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; other undynamic cultures are today). As tacky as you might think it is, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; current American Culture seems to presently be the most competetive culture in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; current existence (Or North American culture, as a Canadian would say ;)). Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; course that could change, and if it does, we could all be eating tofu.....</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Well, from the outside, the way I (and i assume most of the rest of the world) see</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it, the US did not "win" world war II or the post-war period, it did what it has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; done most of this century, which is wait for the combatants to wear each other out</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and then to step in.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And you think that that doesn't demonstrate capable leadership?</i><br>
<p>
No, not at all. It demonstrates rat cunning.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The US entered world war I in 1917 (!), and would undoubtedly have entered world war 2</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; later on in the piece if the Japanese hadn't seen the writing on the wall and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tried to get in first. The US is more competitive than the French. Sure. the french</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have also fought three major wars on their own territory in 100 years, whereas the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; US has merely exported such.  This attitude you have is akin to someone stepping in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; at the late part of a fight, kicking the victor in the head several times while they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are trying to get off the floor, and then telling everyone how tough they are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or busting down the door to the bar where two drunken bullies are pummeling each other,</i><br>
<i>&gt; breaking them up, and making them go sit in the corner.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah. Sure. Go ahead and convince yourself that this is the case.<br>
You can tell yourself that this is the way it operated as much as<br>
you like, but I have yet to see a posting from someone outside<br>
the US who agrees with you. What does this suggest?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; No</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one believes it. Sure, the US has nukes. The US developed it's nukes with the help</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of the rest of the allies, and then used it's undamaged economic base, maintained on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a war footing throughout the 50s to run about and bully the rest of the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is said that what caused the US superiority after the war was the nazi policy towards</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jews. </i><br>
<p>
And we all know how much credence to lend hearsay.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The dozen most brilliant men in Europe fled to the US as a result. Thus, the Nazis</i><br>
<i>&gt; helped us to gain post war superiority far more than any of our allies. The British</i><br>
<i>&gt; could have done the same using Canada as a base if they had the capability, but they did</i><br>
<i>&gt; not. </i><br>
<p>
Having just fought a major war and being preoccupied in<br>
dismantling an empire, I find it difficult to comprehend how they<br>
could have done this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The French had the earliest start in the race with Madame Curie's work, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; preferred to collaborate with the Nazis. Stalin initially looked on nuclear physics as</i><br>
<i>&gt; mere jewish quackery that violated socialist principles, and was therefore suppressed</i><br>
<i>&gt; until spies in the Manhattan Project indicated its use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; While I have a lot of friends in the US, and on the whole most of the americans I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have come across are very nice people, this bullshit manifest destiny attitude is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; incredibly annoying, and I remind you of what happened to Rome when the empire fell,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and consider the gunboat diplomacy the US has been practising for most of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; century, and the widespread resentment it has engendered.  if the US way of life was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; so incredibly superior, why is it that no-one else feels this way? I don't see the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; american way of doing things taking over the world. Democracy is not an american</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; invention, neither is capitalism. What purely american systems have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; successfully exported overseas?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the US way of life is so inferior, why is it that everyone wants our lifestyle and</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard of living?</i><br>
<p>
Oh? So why exactly does the rest of the world still live in the<br>
rest of the world, then?<br>
I would agree that the rest of the world does want your standard<br>
of living. Yes.  Not your way of life, certainly not your<br>
international relations, but I will grant you that the rest of<br>
the world would like the opportunity to be as rich as the united<br>
states. But this is simply a measure of wealth, it in no way<br>
validates the american way of life.<br>
<p>
I live in Australia. We have one of the highest standards of<br>
living in the world. I can't honestly think of a single person I<br>
know who in any way envies life in the United States. [thinks<br>
hard]  Nup.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While most other democratic governments utilize a parliamentary system of government,</i><br>
<i>&gt; these have proven to be rather unstable and prone to rapid populist influence (bread and</i><br>
<i>&gt; circuses),</i><br>
<p>
Oh. Okay. You are of course referring to something other than the<br>
Westminster System which as far as I know is quite a robust<br>
parliamentary system.<br>
<p>
Two words: Ronald Reagan.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the US uses a republican system with, as you must know, three equally</i><br>
<i>&gt; powerful branches that are capable of checking the other. This system provides a measure</i><br>
<i>&gt; of negative feedback that helps hold in check the most contagious of populist fads and</i><br>
<i>&gt; foolishness.</i><br>
<p>
You are of course joking. The President of the United States has<br>
as much power as the other two branches of government. This has<br>
always struck me as dangerously absurd, but given that it was<br>
created in the wake of a monarchy, understandable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In a century where europeans and asians heralded the end of the age of the individual,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the advent of the collective, only to be proven in the 1980-1990 period to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; hopelessly wrong by the US, the US has stood out as a lone beacon of continued</i><br>
<i>&gt; individualism, self reliance.</i><br>
<p>
you really do have it bad, don't you? Do you really believe this<br>
propaganda? I'm not sure that anyone outside your country does,<br>
and I wonder what the rest of this list from the US thinks. I'd<br>
have thought this list would be discussing solutions and<br>
strategies for the post-statist reality, instead I find myself<br>
sucked into a foolish argument about the "superiority" of the<br>
american way of life, laced so far with very little real<br>
evidence, and an awful lot of opinion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We have successfully purged the welfare state from our</i><br>
<i>&gt; federal system, and most of our state governments.</i><br>
<p>
Congratulations. How many million homeless people do you have?<br>
What percentage of your population is locked up? Well done, I<br>
must say.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Other nations that have followed suit</i><br>
<i>&gt; now enjoy stronger economies than their stagnant socialist neighbors.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I'd rather live in a poor but free country than a rich one<br>
where huge proportions of the population is locked up. Waa hoo<br>
free enterprise, where you are free to work hard but do little<br>
else. No thanks, I'd rather stay in my happy little socialist<br>
nation where we don't lock people up -quite- as much.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The main groups objecting to the 'US way' are the east asian tyrannies and dictators in</i><br>
<i>&gt; China, Indonesia, Singapore, Burma, Vietnam, etc.. </i><br>
<p>
Oh? Where are they on this list? So far the objections have come<br>
from germany, russia, australia and uruguay.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They have claimed for the past eight</i><br>
<i>&gt; years that their Cunfucian culture is superior and can successfully be melded to an open</i><br>
<i>&gt; market, yet as recent asian markets indicate, this does not seem to be so. While asian</i><br>
<i>&gt; markets continue to hit new lows, the US market has rebounded nicely and is now setting</i><br>
<i>&gt; new highs. The 'Asian Flu' seems to be more systemic of asian systems than western style</i><br>
<i>&gt; economies.</i><br>
<p>
Western money prompted the huge development projects, and the<br>
withdrawal of western money created the collapse, and now western<br>
money is buying the place up at bargain basement prices.  the<br>
coming century will be an unlucky time to be white, I feel, when<br>
the rest of the world gets its shit together and realises what<br>
the west has done over the last couple of hundred years, and is<br>
continuing to do.<br>
<p>
Bah, I'm over this thread.<br>
