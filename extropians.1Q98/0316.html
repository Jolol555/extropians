True. but the original question was (more or less) "can we build<br>

I disagree. There are two major perceived dangers of nuclear energy:<br>
waste isotopes and massive energy release. If nanotech can permit us to<br>
build tiny reactors, the massive energy release goes away: your "mister<br>
fusion" is more like your gas tank than like a supertanker or an oil<br>
refinery in this regard.<br>
 If, as you say, nanotech can permit complete recovery of<br>
the dangerous isotopes generated<br>
by neutron activation, then all that remains is deactivation of those<br>
same isotopes. This is also perfectly feasible, because these isotopes<br>
can be exposed to still more fast neutrons by recycling them back into<br>
the fusion reactor. Most of atoms will eventually transform to stable<br>
isotopes under additional exposure to fast neutrons. The tiny percentage<br>
that do not can be separated (again by nanotech) and deactivated in a<br>
tiny<br>
particle accellerator. These processes are on balence highly exothermic,<br>
so<br>
the entire process of deactivation should yield a substantial net gain<br>
in useable thermal energy. All of this hold true even if your reactor<br>
must use D-D or D-T, both of which produce a lot of primary fast<br>
neutrons<br>
and therefore a relatively large amount of isotopic transformation.<br>
Remember<br>
that nanotech is likely to permit the use of diamondiod structural<br>
components<br>
instead of steel, so the reactor will be activating carbon instead of<br>
iron:<br>
that is, most of the resulting isotopes will be fairly benign. Now, if<br>
nanotech<br>
permits us to use the H-H reaction instead of D-D, we won't have much<br>
of a problem to solve, because there are no fast neutrons generated in<br>
the primary reaction.<br>
