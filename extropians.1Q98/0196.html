<i>&gt; Hi,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If any of you were watching the Discovery Channel program called "Shoot</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; NOT to Kill" last night, you'd notice a device I had developed back in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the late 80's is now being bandied about as a law enforcement tool. They</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; discussed the use of short range contact and focussed beam EMP weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to easily stop automobiles. I had built a device exactly like they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; discussed and demonstrated back in '89 and used it successfully against</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; police trying to stop me for speeding. It shot a focussed EMP pulse in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cone behind my vehicle to a range of about 150 feet that would toast the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; engine control chips of a pursuing vehicle....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; how often were you able to use this device?  did the police ever find out?</i><br>
<i>&gt; If so, what did they do?</i><br>
<p>
The local pigs never figured it out. I got put out of business by a<br>
bigger gun:<br>
<p>
I was driving to work (I was stationed at Cannon AFB at the time) and<br>
drove under the approach path to the runway when an F-111 came over.<br>
There had to be some sort of automatic system that recognises signals<br>
that resemble jamming signals or some such (which was what my device<br>
looked like from several hundred yards away, radio wize) on the<br>
Aardvark. I guess it tried to burn through the signal, which wound up<br>
toasting my device. Good thing the capacitor was in the back of the<br>
pickup's bed with stuff in between it and me with nobody behind my<br>
vehicle. It blew up with what had to be the force of a grenade, messed<br>
up the back of my pickup bad, and I was lucky it didn't get the gas<br>
tank...<br>
<p>
Fun fun fun.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While being fascinated by such devioces, I'm even more fascinated by their</i><br>
<i>&gt; active use, as most of the people I know just put up with the police like</i><br>
<i>&gt; good little citizens (including me, generally).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I know, but I had really gotten sick of the jackboot attitude of these<br>
New Mexico hicks, so I just decided to eliminate the threat<br>
peacefully....<br>
