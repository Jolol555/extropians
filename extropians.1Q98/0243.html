This seems exactly right.  And I agree that kalyptic extropianism (say,<br>
"lifestyle extropianism") is indeed pleasant and useful for its<br>
participants.  But one gets the impression from more strident postings to<br>
the list here and there, that a number of people feel that there is<br>
already a "regal extropianism" they are a part of.  This has always<br>
confused me, and I have been curious to hear about what it consists of<br>
exactly.  <br>
	The details have been slow to emerge.  However, I am beginning<br>
to think that there *is* a place for a regal mode of extropianism (say,<br>
"movement extropianism").  This is not because I think any of us are<br>
looking to "belong" to an orthodoxy -- that's something surely most of us<br>
would resist.  But I think that the preoccupations of "lifestyle<br>
extropianism" produce certain perceptions and sensitivities that put<br>
extropians in a position to see the world and especially the onrushing<br>
future with unique insights.  We see promises and dangers that few people<br>
are thinking about (isn't that what draws us here in the first place?)... <br>
and this means we are in a position to strategize in the face of that<br>
future in completely unique ways.  <br>
	The agenda emerging from this strategizing could very well yield<br>
the regal extropianism you speak of. Of course, kalyptic and regal<br>
extropianism would comfortably coexist, and there would be no necessity to<br>
choose the one over the other, or to demand that the one evolve or devolve<br>
into the other.  If kalyptic strategies are indeed as vulnerable as you<br>
suggest, perhaps one of the functions of regal extropianism would be<br>
precisely to protect kalyptic extropianism as a free lifestyle from<br>
memetic competitors in the first place, despite its necessary and<br>
delightful resistence to the hierarchization and hardening of the<br>
orthodoxies that works to preserve other meta-memetic regimes (e.g.,<br>
religions, justice discourses, etc).  <br>
