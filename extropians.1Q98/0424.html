Rick Rossi asked:<br>
<p>
"What would be the legal argument for making the cloning of humans illegal<br>
in the United States"?<br>
<p>
<p>
Dear Rick and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
There is no valid legal argument for banning cloning in the United States.<br>
<p>
The issue is entirely political and primarily influenced by the quasi-moral<br>
fantasies of the so-called "religious right", and promoted by the mass<br>
media.<br>
<p>
As usual the popular media has latched on to this as a headline grabber<br>
designed to attract a scientifically ignorant mass audience. Regrettably,<br>
most of the editors in the mass media seem to be as scientifically ignorant<br>
as their readers and viewers. As to the general morality of most of the<br>
editors of the media, I somehow doubt that many of them even know the<br>
meaning of the word.<br>
