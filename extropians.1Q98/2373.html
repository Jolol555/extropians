Hello Reilly, Ian and Extropians All,<br>
<p>
<p>
What a great discovery [this list]!   Since I have no material contribution<br>
to make I credit myself with 'discovering' this fab group and its concepts,<br>
pretending to a sort of ownership.   Cheap trick, I'll admit.   However, I do<br>
have a marginal aside to the present discussion; a poem I wrote in<br>
appreciation of Reilly's mind on this matter.<br>
<p>
Blue<br>
<p>
If I think blue and ask you too<br>
You will but then again you won't<br>
For I've seen skies you've never seen<br>
And you've said things I've not<br>
<p>
So since my blue is blue to me<br>
And yours to me is not<br>
Then I'll think blue and so will you<br>
But we'll be blue, apart<br>
<p>
The poem - just a sentiment - merely touches on the discussion at hand, of<br>
course.  But it is a step up from my usual trick of pretending to have<br>
co-discovered Extropian concepts.<br>
<p>

Hello Reilly, Ian and Extropians All,
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What a great discovery [this list]!&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I have no material
contribution to make I credit myself with 'discovering' this fab group
and its concepts, pretending to a sort of ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheap
trick, I'll admit.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I do have a marginal aside to the
present discussion; a poem I wrote in appreciation of Reilly's mind on
this matter.
