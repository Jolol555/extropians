Lets not get distracted by and react to only the "sex scandal" aspects of<br>
the Clinton administration's many scandals.<br>
<p>
The Clintons and their supporters (the vast left wing conspiracy) must be<br>
relieved to have the media and the American people wasting their time and<br>
energy talking about "sex scandals" among "consenting adults" or how evil<br>
Ken Starr's methods are (please ignore any and all evidence of wrongdoing<br>
that may be found in the process).<br>
<p>
But, under our legal and governmental system, I think we have to care<br>
whenever someone lies to us and lies under oath. We have to care if they<br>
tell others to lie and advise them on how to get away with it. We have to<br>
care if they pay others off for lying by getting them undeserved jobs<br>
that others should have.  All that and more has to be investigated to<br>
determine the truth. <br>
<p>
What ever happened to investigating the way the Clinton's persecuted<br>
the travel office employees and illegally used the FBI and IRS to do it<br>
(Billy Dale et al scandal). How about the misappropriation of all those<br>
FBI files; how about payoffs by Tyson Chicken via cattle futures, or<br>
payoffs by Indonesia, or China (John Huang) .... on an on it goes... (But<br>
it really is "just a little sex scandal" and nothing we should be<br>
concerned about).  <br>
<p>
For your entertainment, further allegations (high crimes and misdemenors)<br>
that should be investigated (to determine the truth) follow:<br>
