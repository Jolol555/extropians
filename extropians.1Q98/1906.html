When I published an opinion piece in a newspaper recently, following the<br>
reported telomerase breakthrough, I made these points explicitly - that<br>
critics routinely cite myths, legends and horror fiction *as if these were<br>
reports rather than inventions*, and that the actual long-term scientific<br>
goal is rejuvenation plus longevity.  Despite this, the comments I got back<br>
were mostly blind to these qualifications.  Who would wish to go on living,<br>
people bleated, when it meant eating slimy medicated gruel in an old folks'<br>
home - forever? Who was supposed to pay for all these deathless people on<br>
the old-age pension if they lived for 200 years?   How awful if the world<br>
became ruled by a deathless gerontocracy of sclerosed brains in withered,<br>
passionless bodies?  Ugh, not for me, no sirree, Bob!<br>
<p>
I get very annoyed by this sort of unimaginative response, except that--<br>
<p>
--after all, it's the kind of realistic extrapolation you'd be inclined to<br>
make if you knew only linear change and hadn't got hold of the idea of<br>
exponential progress.  And lifespan extension in this century *has* just<br>
been of the `add another couple of years of decrepitude every half decade'<br>
type.  Old people's homes *are* filling up with brain-ruined ghosts with<br>
damaged bodies.  No wonder realists (as people generally regard themselves)<br>
experience a profound anxiety about all this scary science stuff that is<br>
making our last years a purgatory, both for the old themselves and for<br>
those who have to watch over their suffering (and see their savings bleed<br>
away uselessly).<br>
<p>
Nor is appeal to myth and legend altogether as stupid as it might seem.<br>
These *are* the distilled repositories of cultures' hopes, fears,<br>
statements-of-what-cannot-be-said-directly...  Maybe transhumanist thinkers<br>
need to look more carefully at Tithonus and his buddies and learn what the<br>
implicate order of those stories might have to tell us.  (Possibly nothing.<br>
 Maybe just outdated night terrors.  But maybe there's some stuff there we<br>
could benefit from.)<br>
