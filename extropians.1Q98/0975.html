Just read a great SF novel called Kaleidoscope Century, by either John or<br>
Stephen Barnes. He really went nuts with memetic warfare, even developing an<br>
era in the next century which he calls the Meme Wars, in which 7 or 8 memes<br>
are the controlling intelligences of the populace, and are engaged in warfare<br>
with each other, using people as their proxies.<br>
