Do you ask me for evidence for something economically impossible? It's<br>
actually<br>
you who has to prove either by history (which should be possible) or by<br>
economic facts<br>
that the removal of governments will lead to the free market you imagine. You<br>
never post<br>
sources, you never quote statistics -- you don't need this because your belief<br>
is good<br>
enough. It's time to get real, kiddo. And please, stop using caps.<br>

Thanks. I can't get enough of these insults. Give me more, I'll make a book of<br>
them. "Extropian Reasoning".<br>

Eurofighter increases no one's power. Vietnam War didn't increase US gov's<br>
power, actually it caused a lot of havoc there (but not as much as where it<br>
happened). WW II was nominally supposed to increase Hitler's power, but it was<br>
obvious that he stood no chance against the US &amp; the Soviets. Had they wanted<br>
to, the US could have quit the war right after it started, the Holocaust would<br>
never have happened. But they remained rather speechless until the Soviet<br>
Union was in ruins.<br>
