I'll answer 'Yes'. And then I have a big problem. Because if that's so. if<br>
that is what I say I believe... Then what am I doing waisting my time<br>
typing E-mails when I should be clearing mines in Aghanistan or<br>
volunteering for Medicine Sans Frontiers in Namibia?<br>
<p>
It's easy to state we have a moral responsibility, living up to it to that<br>
responsibility could very well cost you a years of recovery therapy, a limb<br>
or your life. I speak from up-close &amp; personal expercience.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; In any case, what is good for my wife or Hillary should then be good enough</i><br>
<i> &gt; for the rest of humanity. We can stop or reduce the dying, we just don't</i><br>
<i> &gt; think a million Ethiopians are worth one spouse. That is immoral.</i><br>
<p>
When you think about it rationally (whatever that still means in this<br>
context...) it seems to me clearly immoral to allow all kinds of suffering<br>
when we have the means to end it (or most of it). When you're in a public<br>
place and someone has a heartattack what do you do? Surely it's not your<br>
fault that this person has a bad heart but that does not mean you have no<br>
obligation as one human to another to do the best you can (even if this is<br>
not much). <br>
But how many people have volunteered for Red Cross activities in Africa or<br>
something like that? Are all those people immoral? I think not. So what's<br>
wrong with this picture?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Which brings us to abortion. When do those cells become human and worth</i><br>
<i> &gt; protecting? Are they equal to Etiopians? The proverbial gray area seems</i><br>
<i> &gt; to be one mircosecond after conception to one microsecond before conception</i><br>
<p>
Why? Respectfully, I still do not understand what is so special about this<br>
biological event. It is stated again and again as a 'fact' but I don't see it.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; (though some old-fashioned Chinese peasents push the boundry a little</i><br>
<i> &gt; further). I honestly believe that no one here, or anywhere else, has put</i><br>
<i> &gt; forth a good arguement that at "________" (period of time) after</i><br>
<i> &gt; conception, you become a human and then get this special protection. </i><br>
<p>
The fact that we cannot pinpoint this down to the second does not mean<br>
there can be consesus about an certain 'time-window' during wich the status<br>
of 'fetus' changes to 'human'. Under Dutch law the the status of fetus<br>
lasts untill several months (I have no exact figures) before the child can<br>
survive outside the womb.<br>
The overwhelming majority of Europeans citizens agrees with this law as<br>
being ethical (are they all primitive barbarians?).<br>
<p>
S0:<br>
<p>
On one side we have a group of people claiming that one is human after<br>
conception because 'something' happens then even though they don't don't<br>
know what that something is.<br>
<p>
On the other side we have a group of people saying that somewhere during<br>
the growthproces a fetus becomes a human even though they are not sure when<br>
precisely.<br>
<p>
Neither side seems to be able to bring 100% solid scientific or ethical<br>
'proof' for their opinion (at least I have't heard it). It then becomes a<br>
question of who's is going to force their opinion of who. No-one is forced<br>
to have an abortion (AFAIK). I respect the fact that some people would<br>
never have an abortion because they feel 'it would not be right'. That's<br>
OK. However, I do not think that gives anyone the right to enforce their<br>
opinions on others.<br>
<p>
The _problem_ is of course that those who are against abortion feel that<br>
the fetus being aborted is a human who is killed based on the opinion of<br>
others.<br>
<p>
And then we're full circle.<br>
<p>
I do not know if it's possible to break this so I'll choose for individual<br>
freedom of choice.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; I am</i><br>
<i> &gt; then left to weigh the relative importance of curtailing for a few months</i><br>
<i> &gt; a persons right to make a certain decision (and the ensuing discomfort of</i><br>
<i> &gt; childbirth) vs the possibilitity of taking a human life. Believing in</i><br>
<i> &gt; mandatory seatbelts, DWI laws, and other minor loss of freedoms,</i><br>
<p>
Having a baby when you're 16 is not a 'minor' loss of freedom. I will<br>
problably define the rest of such a persons life. And the fact that the<br>
baby has a mother who may not yet be ready for the task of raising a child<br>
could very well define a large part of the baby's life too. So with all due<br>
respect I would say that there is a bit more involved than wearing a seatbelt.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt; I vote (dare I say choose) life over discomfort.</i><br>
<p>
See above, clearing mines is _very_ uncomfortable and could very well cost<br>
you your life. Is it worth it?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; However, my mom always taught me that "the good guys always win in the end"</i><br>
<i> &gt; and my Christian faith also teaches me the same. So I just fight the good</i><br>
<i> &gt; fight, don't worry to much and try to be happy :-)</i><br>
<p>
Allow me to say "Amen" (in spite of the fact that I'm the 5th generation of<br>
Atheists in my family ;-)<br>
