I have often wondered about this point. "Elegance" of theory may be<br>
a red herring at times. How much of the typical negative reaction to<br>
new theories is based in aesthetics instead of appropriate critical <br>
thinking? Imponderably, how many times have scientists missed seeing <br>
something really useful because the math was getting ugly?<br>
<p>
By elegance here, I don't mean merely simplicity, in the sense of<br>
choosing between two theories of equivalent power because one is<br>
simpler. That is just economy, Ockham's Razor, or constructive<br>
laziness if you will, and is a Good Thing. <br>
<p>
The question can be turned around, too, and maybe doing this answers <br>
it: scientific aesthetics could be seen as informed and evolved <br>
intuition about what fits and what makes sense in a theory, just as<br>
artistic aesthetics are at least in part based in intuition about what<br>
fits and makes sense in an artistic composition. So then if aesthetics<br>
leads a scientist astray, it's a fault in his fitness function. If <br>
scientific aesthetics falls prey to mere intellectual fashion or to <br>
_idees fixes_, then the effect is worsened.<br>

&lt;a href="<a href="http://www.scienceweek.com/">http://www.scienceweek.com/</a>"&gt;Science Week&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a<br>

article from American Scientist, Mar/Apr 1998 on this subject by James<br>
W. McAllister &lt;mcallister@rullet.leidenuniv.nl&gt;. The summary gives<br>
some famous examples without going into any depth. The &lt;a<br>

only an &lt;a<br>

excerpt&lt;/a&gt; as well. I may have to get off my lazy butt here and find<br>
the "real" world magazine :-)<br>
