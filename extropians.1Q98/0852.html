BEVERLY, Mass. -- A radical new approach to system-on-a-chip architecture<br>
and design is under development by Improv Systems, a startup launched here<br>
recently by several EDA veterans. If this company's Programmable System<br>
Architecture (PSA) and Java-based design system take hold, 21st-century<br>
chip design will bear little relationship to any methodology known today.<br>
Improv Systems is headed by several recent employees of Cadence Design's<br>
Alta Group, including Cary Ussery, president and chief executive officer;<br>
Oz Levia, vice president of engineering; and Ray Ryan, director of PSA<br>
hardware. The new company, which has no relationship to Cadence, plans to<br>
make its money by licensing PSA to semiconductor vendors and will offer<br>
its Windows NT-based design system without charge.  Improv Systems is<br>
proposing a new approach that changes the very vocabulary of design. There<br>
is no notion of "hardware" vs.  "software" design; instead, one uses a<br>
Java compiler to map a binary image onto a PSA chip. Synthesis, simulation<br>
and layout as we know them today don't exist, nor does intellectual<br>
property in the form of soft or hard cores.  While it might be tempting to<br>
think of a PSA chip as a kind of glorified SRAM-based field-programmable<br>
gate array, it's actually unlike anything that now exists. Billed as a new<br>
alternative to the von Neumann/Harvard computer architecture, a PSAing<br>
paper-thin computers, tiny digital still cameras and other digital<br>
multimedia systems [...].<br>
<p>
'gene{ Of course this approach is not exactly new, and not all that<br>
radical. It still uses static (architecture does not change significantly<br>
during the run), rational (similiar to VHDL silicon compilers) design.<br>
<p>
However, for the first time reconfigurable hardware has stepped out of the<br>
ivory tower labs into industry R&amp;D. Via circuitry block paging, the path<br>
to protean-flux architectures is now open, even though this substrate is<br>
definitely not suitable for low-level Darwin in machina. This must be a<br>
fine-grained architecture, potentially capable of bad-block remapping at<br>
production and operation stage -- hence a deep-submicron<br>
wafer-scale-integration-enabling key technology. (We have been waiting for<br>
WSI far too long, methinks). <br>
<p>
Even more important is the imminent paradigm change in the heads of system<br>
designers -- more radical approaches as evolvable hardware and CAMs<br>
suddenly stop sounding like unintelligible noise. <br>
<p>
The Wintel technology road block may suddenly give, granting us a few<br>
frantic years of progress before saturation sets in again.<br>
<p>
Even though limited to 2d architectures, and being still quite grainy, the<br>
new architecture boosts _nondedicated_ performance by orders of magnitude,<br>
augmented by the boons WSI will be granting us.<br>
<p>
The arbitrary boundary between hardware and software will go away, opening<br>
large-scale free projects even wider vistas. The primate of design may<br>
emerge, the first harbinger of the revolution molecular manufacturing is<br>
promising us. <br>
<p>
Somewhat more unfortunate will be the growing impact of outfit size (Intel<br>
would be a nice example for a semimonopoly), as future market success will<br>
depend on investments in inherently costly R&amp;D, as new processes and wafer<br>
fabs. <br>
<p>
On a more lunatic note, a malignant, Blightlike Singularity (artefacts<br>
awakening as a global whole) appears to become a bit more possible. }<br>
