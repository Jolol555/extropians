I just wrote some answers to a Swedish transhumanist survey. <br>
If you see something wrong in this text, please help me improve it.<br>
You can also take part in this survey by sending your own answers<br>
to Jonas Roren &lt;jonas.roren@eden.grace.se&gt; within the next week.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Do you consider yourself transhuman[ist], extropian, both or neither of</i><br>
<i>&gt;these?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
  I do consider myself an extropian. I would call myself a transhumanIST,<br>
meaning that I agree with the general idea of transcending human limits,<br>
and spend considerable time trying to understand related issues, and<br>
advance my own personality.  I have made some success working on my<br>
own personality architecture, taking increasing control over many  of<br>
its elements, and actively pursuing growth on a rational foundation<br>
of disciplines from cognitive science to advanced supplements - I would<br>
say, that the extropian approach here is qualitatively different from<br>
both traditional Western and Oriental ideas on self-improvement, though<br>
partly it is based on both.  Still, no matter how satisfied I am with<br>
my personal progress, I do not think my current state rises far enough<br>
above the conventional human plain to qualify me for any trans-human status.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. Do you believe that the human consciousness has been mapped out to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;extent that it has been made clear that mind uploading theoretically can</i><br>
<i>&gt;be accomplished?</i><br>
<p>
The understanding of the workings of the human consciousness is in a very<br>
primitive state at this point, but I think methodologically we understand<br>
its nature enough to know that eventually it can be learned, modeled, and<br>
replicated in an external medium.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3. Do you have any ideas about in what form(s) an uploaded person would</i><br>
<i>&gt;carry on living? (Artificial worlds, mechanical bodies, colonisation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the outer space, merger of several individuals and multiple copies has</i><br>
<i>&gt;been mentioned)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Uploading is the very first stage of liberating conscious beings from<br>
dependence on legacy substrates and architectures.  Actually, partial<br>
uploading has been going on for thousands of years: people have been<br>
creating external tools for acquisition, storage, transmission, and<br>
processing of information, and relying on these external tools to carry<br>
functions originally performed by their brains.  Even a straightforward<br>
upload, without any personality hacking, would have some dramatic<br>
immediate benefits: real immortality assured by incremental personality<br>
backups, instant cheap travel (it's just transmission of information now,<br>
right?), ability to greatly speed up all mental functions (or slow them<br>
to any level, that effectively gives one infinite patience), etc.<br>
Then, the person could switch between multiple external sensors, so<br>
all the world's telescopes, microscopes, microphones, thermometers, and<br>
other devices would become people's shared sensory organs.<br>
With better understanding of the structure of the uploaded consciousness,<br>
the post-human beings would be able to redefine parts of their personality,<br>
access other people's knowledge as their own ("remote thinking"), trade<br>
internal mental images, accept arbitrary artificial extensions, and do many<br>
other things that will make all our current notions of personality and<br>
identity obsolete.<br>
I theorize in greater detail about the possibilities of the distributed<br>
"liquid intelligence" of the post-human future in my essay "Networking in<br>
the Mind Age". - see <br>

indage.html&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;4. How would society be shaped in a future where mind uploading is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;reality? Is it desireable to have all means of control abolished?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
  The architecture of the global cognition system will be very different<br>
from the current collection of individual bodies with downloaded social<br>
knowledge.  The role of "personalities" would be transferred to "nodes of<br>
influence" and then to what I call "Teleological threads" - sequences<br>
of structures modifying themselves to achieve certain (also drifting)<br>
goals.  Goals will be more persistent than structures in the time of<br>
architectural self-control.  Of course, some methods of control are<br>
absolutely necessary, as they have always been in all systems.  Others<br>
would be detrimental to stability, growth, or efficiency of different<br>
parts of the system. The set of control structures will never be optimal,<br>
as it has never been. In any case, neither subjects, nor objects of control<br>
will look anything like [collections] of personalities, in today's sense of<br>
the word. The closest entity that I envision to the current concept of<br>
personality, would be a set of interconnected contractual relationships<br>
between various functional units (that at the same time can also engage<br>
in other sets of relations), working on a coordinated set of projects - <br>
an advanced analog of a "virtual corporation".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;5. For whom should mind uploading be possible? What factors will</i><br>
<i>&gt;determine, economical, moral? Will any form of control be needed?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I think the first interesting question is for whom it *could* be possible.<br>
People who cannot perceive themselves separated from their bodies and do<br>
not have courage, intelligence, and experiential flexibility to accept<br>
such a dramatic change (and that includes practically everybody currently<br>
alive) could be uploaded, but for as their personalities cannot "digest"<br>
such a transition, it would be destructive for them.  "Destruction through<br>
improvement", is "death forward" of sorts.  It's not a new phenomenon,<br>
we do this to the personalities of our children by raising and educating<br>
them, which changes them beyond recognition, but here the transition would<br>
be a lot more immediate, unexpected and traumatic.<br>
<p>
Even when uploading becomes both technologically possible and personally<br>
acceptable for some individuals, the transition to new forms and necessary<br>
changes in social structures would be very serious, and would require and<br>
cause a lot of control issues.  Most likely, the traditional power centers<br>
will exercise their control against the requirements of progress, as it <br>
is happening today.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;6. Isn't there an imminent risk for overpopulation if humanity gains</i><br>
<i>&gt;immortality?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
  The Universe is pretty large.  Immortality doesn't increase population,<br>
making new individuals beyond necessity and reason does. If the population<br>
of advanced countries was today granted eternal youth, there probably would<br>
be little change in the population. Sure, old people would die less (except<br>
suicides, accidents, etc.) - but younger people will delay having children,<br>
as they can always do it later, and we would see a great drop in birth rates.<br>
In any case, prohibiting immortality, that is, killing some people so that<br>
some others could bring currently non-existent people to life, doesn't seem<br>
more ethical than feeding old neighbors to your children.<br>
<p>
In more distant future, post-uploads inhabiting artificially expanded<br>
Multiverse, will take care of this problem.  Meanwhile, if every person<br>
makes only the children s/he knows she can raise, their won't be any problem. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;7. What will be the further challenges for man if one could live forever?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Aggressive self-modification.  Immortality is a very conservative goal.<br>
Nobody would just like to preserve themselves in the same state.<br>
Those who do not change as aggressively as it is technologically possible,<br>
will effectively drown in the rising tide of intelligence.  Even if they<br>
are kept alive by sentimental hyper-transcendent entities, nothing will<br>
depend on them, and they will not be able to discover anything new or do<br>
any useful work for themselves or others.  As these things are fundamental<br>
to humans, being human in the transhuman company will be also impossible.<br>
So man will not live forever.  Our descendants will, hopefully, but they<br>
won't be human. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;8. Do you see mind uploading as a step in the evolution of man?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it may be its final step.  I am not sure it would or should be done<br>
though.  If we learn to build new intelligent structures before we figure<br>
out how to replicate the brain, we could just build new and better entirely<br>
artificial minds, and then nobody will need to preserve humans  :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;9. Mind Uploading would lead to a generation (the one in power) becoming</i><br>
<i>&gt;immortal. Isn't there a risk that this would lead to some form of</i><br>
<i>&gt;stagnation?</i><br>
<p>
The power structure always tries to use new inventions to better keep<br>
its old positions.  I do not think it would be a great factor here though.<br>
The society changes so rapidly now that it is very difficult to be relevant<br>
for long.  Old people are under-represented in leadership of frontier<br>
social movements (take extropians) or cutting-edge science and technology<br>
partly because they are less numerous and physically and mentally able,<br>
but mostly because their experiences are largely irrelevant in today's<br>
world, and appear actually detrimental to their ability to contribute to,<br>
or control emergent directions.  In Japan, with life-time employment of<br>
industrial managers, they have a whole class of "sitting near the window"<br>
old executives still holding nominal control positions, luxury offices,<br>
and high salaries, but not understanding, and not controlling anything<br>
anymore.<br>
<p>
  Old entities always have greater power, and always eventually lose, now<br>
sooner than ever.  This applies also to humans.<br>
