Virtual Obsession<br>
<p>
by Bill Harris <br>
<p>
On February 26, ABC airs "Virtual Obsession," the imaginative thriller from<br>
Director/Producer Mick Garris ("Stephen King's The Stand", "Stephen King's<br>
The Shining"). Peter Gallagher ("While You Were Sleeping") and Mimi Rogers<br>
("Someone to Watch Over Me") star in what is being called a "romantic<br>
thriller." <br>
<p>
Dr. Joe Messenger (Gallagher) is a happily married man living with his<br>
wife, Karen (Rogers) and his young son, Jake (Jake Lloyd). Messenger is a<br>
brilliant researcher in the fields of artificial intelligence and<br>
immortality. One of his projects is an AI super computer that controls and<br>
monitors much of Salt Lake City, where the Messengers live.<br>
<p>
Messenger's team seeks a means by which a human personality may be uploaded<br>
into a super computer. One of the members of his staff is Juliet Spring<br>
(Bridgette Wilson), a brilliant, beautiful young woman. Messenger and<br>
Spring begin a torrid extramarital affair, complicated by Spring's terminal<br>
medical condition. Knowing she is going to die, Juliet proposes to be the<br>
test subject for Messenger's work. <br>
<p>
Joe realizes that his affair could cost him his family, and breaks off the<br>
affair - or at least he tries to. Juliet succeeds in uploading her mind and<br>
personality into the super computer. With nearly limitless power at her<br>
disposal, Juliet seeks to eliminate all that stands between her and Dr.<br>
Messenger. Imagine Glenn Close in your PC. Yikes!<br>
