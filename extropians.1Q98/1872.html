<i>&gt; &gt;bestial nature of the people it dismisses.  Muddying these categorical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;waters and so depriving this rhetorical tactic of its sting would possibly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be a salutary thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I don't know. How likely is it that people who are open to racist rhetoric</i><br>
<i>&gt; will also be open to adopting your ethics in a consistently principled way?</i><br>
<p>
I think that a prior indifference to the suffering of beings<br>
conspicuously capable of experiencing it has a lot to do with what you<br>
describe as the "openness" of some people to racism in the first place.<br>
Fwiw, there is actually quite a lot of evidence that pathological<br>
criminality is very often preceded by childhood torturing of animals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Where do racist vegetarians like Hitler fit into this?</i><br>
<p>
Ah, Hitler.  Well, there is little doubt that Hitler's vegetarianism was a<br>
hygenic rather than ethical fastidiousness.  I read recently in an animal<br>
rights rag (I think it was the inaptly named "The Animals Agenda")  an<br>
article that suggested Hitler's vegetarianism is exaggerated anyway, and<br>
that in fact he regularly ate pork and fish.  There is also research to<br>
suggest that the specific practices and institutional arrangements of the<br>
death camps bore in mind "advances" in then-recent factory farming<br>
techniques (transport, storage, hygiene, slaughter, disposal, etc.) <br>
Brrrr.  But the force of your point is mostly secure after these quibbles<br>
and caveats of mine.  Yes, it's not like vegetarianism provides any<br>
guarantees. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My impression is that xenophobic intolerance rarely depends in any important</i><br>
<i>&gt; way on classifying others as subhuman. </i><br>
<p>
Really?  I am actually quite shocked how often I hear people say of their<br>
enemies or their presumed inferiors that they are "animals".  It pays to<br>
remember in this regard that the characteristic gesture of liberation<br>
struggles is the demand that "we will no longer be treated *as* animals!"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It appears to be largely an</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolutionary adaptation for creating tribal unity that is most powerfull</i><br>
<i>&gt; when the objective differences between the tribes are smallest (i.e. when</i><br>
<i>&gt; the danger of tribe members defecting is largest).</i><br>
<p>
This makes me think of the totemic consolidation of tribal identity, and<br>
of how often the totem figure is a (nonhuman) animal.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hatred towards, say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; mosquitos, seems to be much more subdued than hatred between Catholics</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Protestants in Northern Ireland.</i><br>
<p>
Read about the Dirty Protests and tell me that the theme of the "merely"<br>
animal versus the "true" human has no place in the maintenance and<br>
invigoration of hatreds between the Catholics and Protestants of Northern<br>
Ireland.<br>
<p>
Best, Dale<br>
