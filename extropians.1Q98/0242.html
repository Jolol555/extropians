This seems right to me.  An organization or public agenda devoted<br>
specifically to these tasks would look pretty extropian to me.  Although<br>
the conspicuous future-orientation of extropianism remains pretty implicit<br>
in this agenda as it stands.  Isn't a movement to clear a space for<br>
self-transformation only half the extropian battle though?  We also want<br>
to safeguard against potential *dangers* that almost nobody else is in a<br>
real position to perceive.  Foresight's BioArchive project may be an<br>
example of this sort of activism.  I'd be interested to hear ideas for<br>
others as well.  Is it useless to anticipate and work to protect ourselves<br>
against some of the worst threats implicit in a technological singularity,<br>
for example?   Best, Dale<br>
