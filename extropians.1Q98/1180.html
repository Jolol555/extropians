As Leno suggested, the title of her next book will be "It Takes a Village to Keep<br>

Today, the White House was complaining that all of these sexual scandals are<br>
interfering with Clinton's ability to govern the country. I have just one<br>
question and a statement  in response:<br>
<p>
Why didn't you think of that BEFORE you unzipped?<br>
<p>
and: If its such a problem, theres an easy answer: RESIGN!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's see if we have a mandate for _that_. Hmm, what is the etymological</i><br>
<i>&gt; root of the word "dork"?</i><br>
<p>
The root of the word dork is that it is meant to describe someone who tries to<br>
open doors in the wrong direction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; PO: Let's not impeach him, let's just pass a "white Kryptonite" federal law</i><br>
<i>&gt; that removes all his powers until he steps down. Hmmm. Or he has to wear a</i><br>
<i>&gt; dunce cap except in his sleeping quarters as long as he remains in office.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or a law that enforces a novelty condom cap portrait shot required during</i><br>
<i>&gt; every photo op. Heck, how about anyone that lets the Secret Service pat</i><br>
<i>&gt; them down gets to pie him or pants him?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's find a new way, every day, to mock Slick Willie until he wilts!</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...IF he deserves it.</i><br>
<p>
This weekend I saw "Wag the Dog" and I was just STUNNED by the parallels to the<br>
current story. Keep your hats on and get out your New World Order detectors when<br>
we start bombing Albania..... ;)<br>
<p>
If the current scandal IS manufactured, I give them a big aesthetic thumbs down<br>
for complete unoriginality in that they are reduced to stealing the plot of a<br>
movie.<br>
