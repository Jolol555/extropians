Here's one more who agrees.<br>

<p>
If by that you mean Roe v. Wade was the first ruling ever that abortion<br>
is not necessarily murder, you're out of your tree.<br>

For the same reason it's not immoral to allow people to suffer the<br>
presence<br>
of unSaved neighbors.<br>

Or not, depending on one's beliefs about murder.<br>
