This will probably make me sound like more a quack than I already am, but<br>
how many people here have heard Richard Hogland's presentation about this<br>
set of structures?<br>
<p>
Not being a scientist, I felt his ideas compelling. Does anyone know who<br>
or what I'm talking about??<br>

If you scroll to the bottom of his site:<br>
<a href="http://www.enterprisemission.com/stores.html">http://www.enterprisemission.com/stores.html</a> you can order his video<br>
and/or buy his book which have more details. The video is what I<br>
experienced, but those who read the book said that it was difficult to<br>
turn away from his calculations.<br>
