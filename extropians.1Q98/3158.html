Further to my report that I was<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; astounded to hear Lovelock's claim that after his</i><br>
<i>&gt; unpatented invention (in the '50s? ' 40s?) of the microwave oven - or at</i><br>
<i>&gt; least of using microwaves to thaw frozen stuff - certain researchers in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; '50s successfully revived small frozen mammals by that method.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How pristine the animals' neurology was and how long they lasted after</i><br>
<i>&gt; revival wasn't made clear, but Lovelock was explicit about their chilly</i><br>
<i>&gt; temporary state - frozen hamsters, he said, were quite solid; you could</i><br>
<i>&gt; knock them against the lab bench.  After thawing, they'd run around.</i><br>
<p>
Paul Wakfer responded, and allowed me to cc to these lists:<br>
<p>
========================<br>
<p>
The people at Biotime do this regularly. Don't forget the hamsters are<br>
"designed" to hibernate and go to very low temperatures in the winter.<br>
Yes, they can actually withstand a percentage of their brain water<br>
turned to ice (I forget how much). In addition, any mammal when cooled<br>
to near the ice point becomes stiff as a board and might appear to be<br>
quite solid. This is because the body's structural elements are mostly<br>
lipid and get very vicous/solid at that temperature. The dogs that 21CM<br>
does deep hypothermia experiments on (5+ hours at 2-3'C) feel like that.<br>
And yes you could probably knock them against a lab bench without much<br>
damage to them (merely a small surface bruise when they were rewarmed)<br>
because the flesh is neither brittle nor very crushable.<br>
<p>
However, unfortunately, this and frozen frogs, fish, etc. are very<br>
little help to our needs in cryonics. The main reason for this is that<br>
chemistry, metabolism and biology are still proceeding and degradation<br>
is still taking place. For example, if you took any of the species which<br>
freeze and kept it in that state for even twice as long as the longest<br>
that it normally is in that state, the vast majority would not survive.<br>
Certainly, if you went out to 10 times, *none* would survive. In fact,<br>
the only animals which can stand very long periods of "suspended<br>
animation" are very small species which can completely desiccate (brine<br>
shrimp, tardigrades, etc).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have a lot of respect for Lovelock's integrity and ingenuity.  Yet this</i><br>
<i>&gt; claim appears to surpass anything that current cryonics specialists seem</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to replicate.</i><br>
<p>
That's only because we believe that this approach is a waste of our<br>
scarce resources. If we had enough money for suspended animation<br>
research, we would certainly be looking into the possibility of using or<br>
modifying animal anti-ice compounds.<br>
<p>
===================<br>
<p>
Charles Platt told me (and I quote without explicit permission):<br>
<p>
===================<br>
<p>
Undoubtedly the experiments he is referring to were Audrey Smith's, with <br>
hamsters. Extremities of the hamsters were indeed frozen solid, but <br>
internally the hamsters had to contain less than, I think, 60 percent <br>
ice, otherwise they didn't revive. Even the hamsters that were revived <br>
tended not to live very long, as a result of many ruptured blood vessels <br>
and gastrointestinal bleeding.<br>
<p>
A "diathermy" unit was used to thaw the hamsters. As I recall, this was <br>
an early device using radio-frequency (RF) radiation. I think it's <br>
actually a little lower in the spectrum than microwaves, but is virtually <br>
the same thing. Originally it was used to apply heat to injured joints <br>
and muscles (I think).<br>
<p>
===================<br>
<p>
I replied:<br>
<p>
According to Lovelock, they started out by applying a red-hot spoon to the<br>
chest of the chilled animal to kickstart its heart.  Left nasty burns<br>
(d'oh), so he came up with his kinder, gentler gadget.<br>
<p>
Thanks to both gentlemen for their information.<br>
