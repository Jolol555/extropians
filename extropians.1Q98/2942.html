Hello, fellow extropians. I enjoy bouncing biological ideas on all of<br>
you, I usually get great responses! I am working on a new idea (at<br>
least, I have not been able to find anything like it in the literature)<br>
on non-coding DNA. I have enclosed a copy of my abstract.<br>
<p>
I am hoping those of you interested in junk DNA would be so kind to<br>
reply to me with comments.<br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>

                                Abstract<br>
<p>
All eukaryote cells posses extremely large amount of non-coding DNA,<br>
which does not appear to be directly or indirectly involved in<br>
transcription. A number of models (i.e. junk DNA, selfish DNA, skeletal<br>
DNA, and nucleotypic DNA) have been proposed to explain the existence of<br>
these non-informational sequences. Genomes are complex entities and it<br>
should be noted that the division between coding and non-coding<br>
sequences is an artificial simplification of the real-world situation.<br>
It is likely that the various kinds of non-coding sequences such as<br>
introns, pseudogenes, transpons, and teleomeres all have different<br>
evolutionary histories. Since there is a great diversity of non-coding<br>
sequences, the above hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive.<br>
I would like to offer a new model that might explain the maintenance of<br>
non-coding sequences in the genome. The mutation buffer hypothesis<br>
suggests that non-informational DNA has a passive functionality and can<br>
confer a selective advantage to an organism. This model proposes that<br>
the non-coding sequences act as a huge buffer in order to absorb the<br>
majority of mutations to the genome. Since most of the mutations within<br>
coding sequences would be deleterious and potentially lethal to progeny,<br>
the existence of "buffer DNA" could prevent decreases in fitness. With a<br>
large buffer, many mutations would not have any negative effects on the<br>
next generation because they would not alter coding sequences. Although<br>
the mutation rate would remain constant, the number of mutations that<br>
actually influenced the fitness of offspring would be reduced in<br>
proportion to the non-coding:coding ratio. The mutation buffer<br>
hypothesis makes the following assumptions:<br>
        1) Point mutations are random events that can happen anywhere<br>
           within the genome. <br>
        2) The probability of one nucleotide being altered from "X" to<br>
           "Y" via mutation is identical for coding and non-coding<br>
           regions. The bases A, T, C, and G can be substituted for any<br>
           X or Y where X is not the same base as Y.<br>
        3) If we compare two genomes with identical loci, the one with<br>
           the higher percentage of non-coding sequences will also act,<br>
           on average, as a stronger mutation buffer. <br>
If the mutation buffer hypothesis can explain the C-value paradox, it<br>
would be expected that K-selected species would have more non-coding DNA<br>
(and a larger buffer) than r-selected species. This is the general<br>
trend. Prokaryote species possess very little, if any, non-coding<br>
sequences while multicellular eukaryotes have extremely high levels of<br>
non-coding sequences. The high cost of replicating, maintaining, and<br>
storing huge genomes would regulate the upper limit of genome size and<br>
the amount of buffer DNA.<br>
