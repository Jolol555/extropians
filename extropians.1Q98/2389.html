<i>        &gt;What is the energy flux upon a square meter of surface 300 m away         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;from a 10 m-radius sphere radiating as a 100 MK blackbody? </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
Let's see, we can find the energy density at the surface of the hot sphere at  <br>
temperature T with the formula <br>
(8PI^5)*(kT)^4/(15h^3 * c ^3) = (2.27*10^-7 watts/M^2*K^4)*T^4 . <br>
<p>
If T is  10^8 degrees Kelvin then  the sphere would radiate 2.27 *10^25  <br>
watts per square meter, that's over 22 million billion  billion watts per  <br>
square meter!<br>
<p>
A sphere of 300 meters has a radius 30 times greater than one of 10 meters, <br>
30^2 = 900 so at 300 meters the energy density would be 900 times weaker, or <br>
2.52 * 10^22 watts per square meter, just a little over 25 thousand billion <br>
billion watts per square meter.<br>
            <br>

<i>        &gt;Are you really proposing that the peak forces generated are         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;sufficient to deformate a macroscopic object made of, say, 1 cm         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;sheet steel? </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Yes. Near the Earth the radiation from the sun is only about a thousand watts <br>
per square meter, that's why solar sails have to be so big, in this case our <br>
target 300 meters from the H bomb would experience radiation pressure <br>
25 billion billion times greater, and that would be a hell of a jolt. <br>
<p>
Remember I'm only talking about the radiation pressure of the light, the <br>
rocket effect would substantial add to the pressure the target received  but <br>
it's not as easy to calculate. <br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I thought the Russies peaked that on Novaya Zhemlya (20 MT expected,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;60 MT estimated real yield). This has been no ground blast, though.</i><br>
<p>
True.<br>
       <br>
<i>         &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>         &gt;&gt;Maybe, but then the design would be inefficient because if the foam         </i><br>
<i>         &gt;&gt;was that ephemeral then most of the X rays energy would pass </i><br>
<i>         &gt;&gt;through all the foam and be wasted, it would not be available to </i><br>
<i>         &gt;&gt;compress the fusion cylinder. Why not use radiation pressure?</i><br>
         <br>
<i>         &gt;Maybe all they wanted was to compress the material to the critical         </i><br>
<i>         &gt;density  to be ignited by the fission primer. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Doesn't seem likely, if that was all that was needed then you wouldn't need  <br>
a primary trigger, it could be done with chemical explosives. <br>
