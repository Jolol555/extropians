<p>
Er, yes, but it's not quite that simple, is it?<br>
<p>
1) Cryonic suspension costs $30,000 - $100,000 dollars or more. <br>
   Do you have that kind of money lying around?<br>
<p>
2) Euthanasia is illegal in most countries in the world, and is <br>
   expensive and takes a long time in places where it isn't. If <br>
   you're suicidal for purely psychological rather than <br>
   physiological reasons, you likely don't want to wait around <br>
   whilst a judge signs you off.<br>
<p>
In practical terms, when a real, every-day person is rational but suicidal,<br>
I think you either have to let them go, or lock them up. I wondered whether<br>
the group would favour me in imposing my will on someone else because I<br>
don't want them to die.<br>
<p>
