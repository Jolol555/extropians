Thanks for the clarification. I'm interested in growth of the corpus of technical<br>
knowledge and its rate of increase. Your argument appears to apply to growth<br>
of the measured economic value of the technology, and may be very valid.<br>
Leading edge technical products los value very quickly. This is also true of a lot<br>
of leading edge intellectual property. This may mean that your slow (economic)<br>
growth and my explosive (technical) growth occuring concurrently.<br>
<p>
I'm sure you are aware of the recent reports of a fear of deflation, and I'm sure<br>
you understand them better than I. However, technical areas the technological<br>
deflation is far greater than the economic deflation. As I understand it, one major<br>
<p>
reason tht deflation is "bad" is that consumers will defer pruchases to wait for<br>
the<br>
price to come down, but for PCS and other hi-tech items, the price is coming down<br>
anyway and always has been.<br>
