I'm not here to be on the cutting edge of everything.  I'm here to *discuss* the cutting edge of<br>
everything. If I were to follow your logic, I would refuse to read anything not written in<br>
lobjan, or some other "cutting edge" language.<br>
<p>
Luckily I don't. I don't follow any logic when it comes to discussion fora such as this one, as<br>
it strikes me as silly to allow some pointless ideal to get between me and those I wish to<br>
discuss things with. I'm here to learn things, to discuss things, to be part of a conversation,<br>
and it seems to me that rather than looking into "progress"-ive standards, we should support<br>
standard standards: something *everyone* can understand, not the 3l33t few. At this point in<br>
time, it seems that  english expressed in ascii work pretty well. Maybe that will change<br>
eventually, but for now it strikes me as ludicrous to say to someone "I'm not interested in what<br>
you have to say because your text isn't 'cool' enough".<br>
<p>
I fail to see how using ascii is holding you back.  I understood perfectly well your point. How<br>
would HTML have made it clearer?<br>
