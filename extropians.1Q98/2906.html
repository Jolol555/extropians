<i>&gt; &gt; You should look at the political arena as more of an x/y coordinate system,</i><br>

<i>&gt; I would argue that it has a potentially infinite number of dimensions. Political</i><br>
<i>&gt; decisions are rarely made on the basis of one or two variables.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, but as a general axiom, most issues are either a matter of social freedom or<br>
economic freedom, or a combination thereof, or can be framed within that system. It also<br>
delineates between merely 'conservative' and 'liberal' labels which are often  painted<br>
with rather broad brushes, so much so that in many cases, parties are insulted to be<br>
under the same roof as another given the same label. An American Libertarian is about<br>
the furthest you can get from a Nazi, yet both are labeled as 'right wing'. Populists<br>
have more in common with Nazis than Libertarians do, yet Populists are frequenly given<br>
the liberal label (except in the case of Pat Buchanan, who proved the similarity between<br>
the two messages).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Really, funny, the native Americans might have something to say about the idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that natural selection doesn't apply to cultural evolution, especially the dead</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ones. So might the Nazis, the Communists, and today, the French, as their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; uncompetetive little culture is getting overrun by Americanization (as most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other undynamic cultures are today). As tacky as you might think it is, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; current American Culture seems to presently be the most competetive culture in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; current existence (Or North American culture, as a Canadian would say ;)). Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; course that could change, and if it does, we could all be eating tofu.....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, from the outside, the way I (and i assume most of the rest of the world) see</i><br>
<i>&gt; it, the US did not "win" world war II or the post-war period, it did what it has</i><br>
<i>&gt; done most of this century, which is wait for the combatants to wear each other out</i><br>
<i>&gt; and then to step in.</i><br>
<p>
And you think that that doesn't demonstrate capable leadership?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The US entered world war I in 1917 (!), and would undoubtedly have entered world war 2</i><br>
<i>&gt; later on in the piece if the Japanese hadn't seen the writing on the wall and</i><br>
<i>&gt; tried to get in first. The US is more competitive than the French. Sure. the french</i><br>
<i>&gt; have also fought three major wars on their own territory in 100 years, whereas the</i><br>
<i>&gt; US has merely exported such.  This attitude you have is akin to someone stepping in</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the late part of a fight, kicking the victor in the head several times while they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are trying to get off the floor, and then telling everyone how tough they are.</i><br>
<p>
Or busting down the door to the bar where two drunken bullies are pummeling each other,<br>
breaking them up, and making them go sit in the corner.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No</i><br>
<i>&gt; one believes it. Sure, the US has nukes. The US developed it's nukes with the help</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the rest of the allies, and then used it's undamaged economic base, maintained on</i><br>
<i>&gt; a war footing throughout the 50s to run about and bully the rest of the world.</i><br>
<p>
It is said that what caused the US superiority after the war was the nazi policy towards<br>
Jews. The dozen most brilliant men in Europe fled to the US as a result. Thus, the Nazis<br>
helped us to gain post war superiority far more than any of our allies. The British<br>
could have done the same using Canada as a base if they had the capability, but they did<br>
not. The French had the earliest start in the race with Madame Curie's work, but<br>
preferred to collaborate with the Nazis. Stalin initially looked on nuclear physics as<br>
mere jewish quackery that violated socialist principles, and was therefore suppressed<br>
until spies in the Manhattan Project indicated its use.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While I have a lot of friends in the US, and on the whole most of the americans I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have come across are very nice people, this bullshit manifest destiny attitude is</i><br>
<i>&gt; incredibly annoying, and I remind you of what happened to Rome when the empire fell,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and consider the gunboat diplomacy the US has been practising for most of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; century, and the widespread resentment it has engendered.  if the US way of life was</i><br>
<i>&gt; so incredibly superior, why is it that no-one else feels this way? I don't see the</i><br>
<i>&gt; american way of doing things taking over the world. Democracy is not an american</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention, neither is capitalism. What purely american systems have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; successfully exported overseas?</i><br>
<p>
If the US way of life is so inferior, why is it that everyone wants our lifestyle and<br>
standard of living?<br>
<p>
While most other democratic governments utilize a parliamentary system of government,<br>
these have proven to be rather unstable and prone to rapid populist influence (bread and<br>
circuses), the US uses a republican system with, as you must know, three equally<br>
powerful branches that are capable of checking the other. This system provides a measure<br>
of negative feedback that helps hold in check the most contagious of populist fads and<br>
foolishness.<br>
<p>
In a century where europeans and asians heralded the end of the age of the individual,<br>
and the advent of the collective, only to be proven in the 1980-1990 period to be<br>
hopelessly wrong by the US, the US has stood out as a lone beacon of continued<br>
individualism, self reliance. We have successfully purged the welfare state from our<br>
federal system, and most of our state governments. Other nations that have followed suit<br>
now enjoy stronger economies than their stagnant socialist neighbors.<br>
<p>
The main groups objecting to the 'US way' are the east asian tyrannies and dictators in<br>
China, Indonesia, Singapore, Burma, Vietnam, etc.. They have claimed for the past eight<br>
years that their Cunfucian culture is superior and can successfully be melded to an open<br>
market, yet as recent asian markets indicate, this does not seem to be so. While asian<br>
markets continue to hit new lows, the US market has rebounded nicely and is now setting<br>
new highs. The 'Asian Flu' seems to be more systemic of asian systems than western style<br>
economies.<br>
<p>
Likewise, the French have similarly been rather stubborn about keeping their welfare<br>
state intact, leading even to widespread rioting and violence, yet the conservative<br>
government policies of the last several years can be credited with the recent slow<br>
easing of inflation and unemployment there, though this past weeks elections would seem<br>
to indicate this will end and France will fall further down the tubes, and possibly out<br>
of the EU common money system for the time being. Those European nations that have<br>
mirrored the US economic policies are sitting in the best positions for leadership in<br>
the new economy there.<br>
