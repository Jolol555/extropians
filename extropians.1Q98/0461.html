<p>
What "God concept" are you talking about?  I do not believe that there<br>
is a pink invisible hippo dressed in a tutu dancing on my keyboard, which<br>
I will refer to as PIHDT.  Just because there are many different PIHDT<br>
concepts, are you stating that I am not rational for rejecting the<br>
entire set of PIHDT concepts?  I suggest that you take your original<br>
message and do a global replace of "God" with "a pink invisible hippo<br>
dressed in a tutu dancing on my keyboard" and then read it again.<br>
<p>
If you are claiming that I should give some special consideration to some<br>
concept, exactly what type of consideration are you talking about and why<br>
I should give different consideration to "God concepts" than to PIHDT<br>
concepts.  Mickey Mouse, PIHDT, and God are all fictional concepts,<br>
sometimes I consider these concepts but I consider these concepts as fictional<br>
concepts.  If you think there is a relevant difference between Mickey Mouse,<br>
PIHDT and God, please state it in detail.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is a huge variety of God concepts.  Probably the most familiar to</i><br>
<i>&gt;those on this list are the Judeao-Christian God concepts.  Many people,</i><br>
<i>&gt;including atheists, have a hard time thinking about God without using</i><br>
<i>&gt;these limited concepts.  But there are countless other ways to invent God</i><br>
<i>&gt;concepts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The idea that our universe was created by an intelligent being is very</i><br>
<i>&gt;attractive to most people.  Of course, that intelligent being could have</i><br>
<i>&gt;many possible characteristics and motivations.  Many atheists continue to</i><br>
<i>&gt;use the tired argument, "if there is a God, why all the suffering?",</i><br>
<i>&gt;without realizing that there is no connection between creating a universe</i><br>
<i>&gt;and ensuring that no suffering occurs within that system.  They have</i><br>
<i>&gt;placed the unnecessary restriction that God must care about suffering and</i><br>
<i>&gt;is able to do anything about it.  That's also true for their arguments</i><br>
<i>&gt;regarding omnipotence or omniscience.  *Some* people's Gods have those</i><br>
<i>&gt;qualities, but not every God concept includes God being omnipotent and</i><br>
<i>&gt;omniscient.</i><br>
<p>
It is the believers in God who came up with the all knowing, all loving,<br>
and all powerful stuff.  The persons who have criticized these silly ideas<br>
should not be condemned, rather praised for calling attention to the errors<br>
in these ideas.<br>
<p>
I am not going to comment on the rest of the post, I don't have the time<br>
or patience.  My strong suggestion is that before people go arguing religion<br>
and theology, they do some basic study in the field.  The best place to <br>
start is the following book:<br>
<p>
 TITLE:     The Retreat to Commitment<br>
 AUTHOR:    W.W. Bartley, III<br>
 PUBLISHER: Open Court<br>
<p>
I hope this does not seem overly harsh, however this is the Extropian email<br>
list and my expectation of a high level of discourse.<br>
