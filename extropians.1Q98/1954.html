<i>&gt;Here's what my TV Guide has to say about it:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thriller 3:00 Virtual Obsession: "A scientist and his family become the</i><br>
<i>&gt;targets of a vindictive young woman who downloadas her brain into a</i><br>
<i>&gt;supercomputer and stalks them after having her heart broken."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hmm... just from this, it doesn't sound like a happy ending for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropian.  Is this movie really going to open people's minds to the idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;of uploading/extropian ideas, or just make them associate it with</i><br>
<i>&gt;"vindictive young stalker women"? (or can you answer that question without</i><br>
<i>&gt;giving way too much of the plot?)</i><br>
<p>
I don't want to give too much away of the plot and spoil the (hopefully!)<br>
entertainment and enjoyment for you, but I can honestly say that there is a<br>
very upbeat denoument for extropians - in fact there are some terrific<br>
pro-extropian arguments throughout the film, and in particular one fine<br>
scene when the hero, scientist Dr Joe Messenger pleads desperately with the<br>
religious bigot father of his dead girlfriend to allow her last wishes of<br>
being cryonically suspended to be carried out.<br>
<p>
The "vindictive" woman referred to in the TV guide is indeed the dead<br>
girlfriend, but she makes a truly wonderfulpro-extropian speech (written by<br>
Preston Sturges and Mick Garris, not me, so I can say that!)  that is going<br>
to make anyone who watches this think about the subject.<br>
