<i>&gt;It seems to me that it is likely (I'll check this) that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;species that are "immortal" live a fairly dangerous life but where</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is possible to find safe niches. Then selection would favor</i><br>
<i>&gt;long-lived individuals who produced offspring all life.</i><br>
<p>
I remember reading some time ago that an insurance company<br>
actuarial sat down and computed how long the average person would<br>
live, if we didn't have an defined lifespan. As I recall, he<br>
computed the average to be around 734 before one accident or<br>
another did us in. If we intend to live longer, we will have to<br>
look at this......  ;)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;For other animals the basic strategy is simply making sure enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;offspring survive, and the fate of the parents after that is</i><br>
<i>&gt;irrelevant; genes leading to a gradual breakdown but increasing</i><br>
<i>&gt;survival in adolescence would be promoted. Of course, this means</i><br>
<i>&gt;we can gradually select away at least some aspects of aging by not</i><br>
<i>&gt;having children before 30, then 40, then 50... (but I doubt</i><br>
<i>&gt;anybody here has the patience for that scheme :-)</i><br>
<p>
I believe we are seeing this now as technology prolongs the period<br>
human females remain fertile. Recent experiments in egg freezing<br>
will increase this. We are also seeing an increase in latter<br>
pregnancy by feminists who pursued careers first. I have two<br>
friends who didn't have there first till 40. (both happy and<br>
healthy by the way). So we are seeing this as a social phenomenon<br>
as well.<br>

Another excellent post Anders.....<br>
