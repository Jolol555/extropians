Yes, it's not immediately obvious that this model doesn't raise more<br>
difficulties than it resolves.  Luckily, David Deutsch addresses this topic<br>
in his THE FABRIC OF REALITY (pp. 216-7):<br>
<p>
`I said that [Shor's algorithm] requires only a few thousand arithmetic<br>
operations.  I meant, of course, a few thousand operations *in each<br>
universe* that contribute to the answer.  All those computations are<br>
performed in parallel, in different universes, and share their results<br>
through interference.'<br>
<p>
That much, of course, is the basis for John Clark's claim.  The interesting<br>
point follows:<br>
<p>
`You may be wondering how we can persuade our counterparts in 10^500-odd<br>
universes to start working on our factorization task.  Will they not have<br>
their own agendas for the use of their computers?  No... Shor's algorrithm<br>
operates initially only on a set of universes that are *identical* to one<br>
another, and it causes them to become differentiated only within the<br>
confines of the factorization engine. ...  There are, no doubt, many other<br>
universes in which we programmed different numbers or never built the<br>
factorization engine at all.  But those universe differ from ours in too<br>
many variables - or more precisely, in variables that are not made to<br>
interact in the right way by the programming of Shor's algorithm - and so<br>
do not interfere with our universe.'<br>
<p>
Is that the sort of issue you were thinking about, Mitch?<br>
