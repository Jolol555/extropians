Hello, sorry it took so long to respond.  First of all our live online auction site, wildauction.com,  is up and running.  <br>
However, we are currently in our final phase of testing.  It is open for business but we have done no advertising and our <br>
first email list won't go out until this weekend (After the USA today story about it).   If you can keep hush hush about it <br>
check it out at <a href="http://www.wildauction.com">http://www.wildauction.com</a> .  Please note, due to our new SSL features some users (In particular AOL and <br>
IE3.x Users), Will have to use the unsecure registration. As a bonus to our first customers we are offering free shipping.  <br>
You asked about what makes us different from the competition.  That's easy!<br>
<p>
No minimum bids!<br>
No Reserve prices!<br>
On a dedicated T3!<br>
Secure registration!<br>
Loaded with computer products!<br>
<p>
Again, the password protections have been removed so check it out.  You might even get a pentium 233MMX for <br>
around 40 bucks. (there aren't that many bidders yet :)<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
John<br>
