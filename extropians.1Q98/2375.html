What is the energy flux upon a square meter of surface 300 m away from a<br>
10 m-radius sphere radiating as a 100 MK blackbody? (Of course these<br>
parameters are ad hoc, and emitting sphere surface grows bigger while<br>
cooling off, &amp;c&amp;c, but this should give us at least some ballpark<br>
figures).  Are you really proposing that the peak forces generated are<br>
sufficient to deformate a macroscopic object made of, say, 1 cm sheet<br>
steel? If we assume above energy flux to persist for 0.5 s, what would the<br>
final travel velocity of a 1 x 1 x 0.01 m steel sheet be? I'd say<br>
negligeably small, few 10 cm/s at best. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the photon's momentum and its energy too.</i><br>
<p>
Ok, I have a cloud of excited atoms over the surface (=not part of it<br>
anymore) which relaxate by radiation into vacuum. How much of it sees the<br>
target?<br>
                  <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;causing the surface material to turn into a gas cloud exploding         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;outwards. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Right, and that will cause the inner material to implode inward and compress.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ouch.                  </i><br>
<p>
What I am saying that this effect contributes 99.999% of the pressure the<br>
surface sees. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Surface turned into gas expands into vacuum, relaxating by EM        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;radiation into the environment, which, if not sol-proximal, is few-K         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;(Big Bang echo) cold space. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but so what?</i><br>
<p>
Excited atom, not part of target, emits a photon. Photon whizzes off, atom<br>
whizzes off. Probability of any of them striking the surface below is &lt;1. <br>
In any case the half-life time must be taken into account, diluting the<br>
energy spike temporally.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [...]                        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Is 100 MT small enough? The difficulties we are talking about is         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;hitting a flurry of habitats/mosaic of subterranous settlings         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;semisimultaneously, requring a large number of brilliant warheads.                         </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Going underground won't help much, during the gulf war bunker busting bombs </i><br>
<i>&gt; penetrated 30 feet of steel reinforced concrete to destroy installations, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; they just had chemical explosives, H bombs could do much better. I suggest </i><br>
<p>
You are talking about direct hits again. What I was saying is that, say, 1<br>
Gpeople distributed over vacuum-separated spatially distributed 100 k<br>
habitats (lunar surface would offer an enrichment, and ground would allow<br>
energy coupling while also enhancing shielding) are drastically more<br>
difficult to kill with nukes since essentially requiring direct habitat<br>
hit each. Since, contrary to antimatter nukes, fissible material requires<br>
a noticeable critical mass (using other transurans than Pu won't help<br>
much) the resulting kill efficiency will be too low for practical use.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; you visit the island of Elugelab, that's where the USA detonated a bomb that </i><br>
<i>&gt; was expected to be of less than 5 megatons but actually produced 15 megatons.</i><br>
<p>
I thought the Russies peaked that on Novaya Zhemlya (20 MT expected, 60 MT<br>
estimated real yield). This has been no ground blast, though. <br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; They blew it up in 1954 on top of a short tower, it produced a fireball 4 </i><br>
<i>&gt; miles in diameter, it terrified the scientists who set it off and trapped </i><br>
<i>&gt; them in their bunker for several days on an island 10 miles away, and it </i><br>
<i>&gt; killed the Japanese sailors on the fishing boat Fukuryu Maru- The lucky </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dragon, who were far from the official danger area and well inside the </i><br>
<i>&gt; "safety" zone.  Actually I'm being unfair, you can't visit Elugelab anymore, </i><br>
<p>
Uh, wasn't that lethality supposed to be due to the fallout solely<br>
(activated coral sand)?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but if you have a submarine you can look at the crater on the sea floor 250 </i><br>
<i>&gt; feet deep and 6500 feet across where Elugelab once was.</i><br>
<p>
A typical atoll's elevation is just few m above the sea surface. Even the<br>
largest devices do not change the landscape noticeably -- you could level<br>
only a very small mountain with them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe, but then the design would be inefficient because if the foam was that </i><br>
<i>&gt; ephemeral then most of the X rays energy would pass through all the foam and  </i><br>
<i>&gt; be wasted, it would not be available to compress the fusion cylinder. Why not </i><br>
<i>&gt; use radiation pressure?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe all they wanted was to compress the material to the critical density<br>
to be ignited by the fission primer. <br>
<p>
I must take your word for that that the radiation pressure is the<br>
determinant, as I cannot prove your numbers. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I found a quotation that gives some support to my theory that the polymer </i><br>
<i>&gt; foam's main function was to protect vital parts made of heavy atoms for a few  </i><br>
<i>&gt; extra nanoseconds, and its use as a plasma generator of only secondary  </i><br>
<i>&gt; importance. Jacob Wechsler was a H bomb engineer and he's talking about  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Carson Mark, the chief designer of the first H bomb:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  "He was really concerned about higher Z materials [elements with higher </i><br>
<i>&gt;   atomic number] being exposed. In a radiation environment with high energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;   radiation  coming down from the primary, anything like steel because it's </i><br>
<i>&gt;   so dense will cause a pressure spike when it vaporizes. Carson was trying </i><br>
<i>&gt;   to sustain a deuterium burn and he was afraid that if things blew off at</i><br>
<i>&gt;   higher Z that  might chop up the fuel, its temperature wouldn't stay high </i><br>
<i>&gt;   enough [...]  the surface of the lead would blow off so we covered the lead </i><br>
<i>&gt;   with plastic, with polyethylene. That was low Z, just CH2  [hydrogen and </i><br>
<i>&gt;   carbon]. From a time point of view the radiation ionization of the heavy </i><br>
<i>&gt;   materials with all that shielding would be so late that it would have </i><br>
<i>&gt;   zilch effect on the overall system."</i><br>
<p>
Interesting quote. Are you aware of any high-quality online resources?<br>
      <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;There's a reason thermonuclear devices are so difficult to build. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I wonder, are they difficult to build? Over 100,000 of the damn things have </i><br>
<i>&gt; been made and several hundred have exploded in tests, some with very unusual </i><br>
<i>&gt; designs, and yet there has not been one dud and most turned out to be more </i><br>
<i>&gt; powerful than expected.                         </i><br>
<p>
Yeah, but while I could build a working crude gun assembler nuke on a very<br>
modest budget, the threshold for a fusion nuke from scratch is worth<br>
man-centuries of high-paid experts. <br>
