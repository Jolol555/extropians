<i>&gt; Yes, *very* interesting! Where can you order one of those? ;-)</i><br>

<p>
it took a capacitor the size of a large thermos to store a charge (don't<br>
remember the value). Took about 5 minutes of charging time off the<br>
alternator, which I had custom installed to provide an extra 15-20 amps.<br>
It used a radar detector type horn with a souped up magnatron from a big<br>
microwave, and a large voltage ladder/network (4 ladders in parallel,<br>
each 20 steps, at around 10-15 kv per step) fed from a custom built<br>
flyback and flip/flop operated SCR feeder from the capacitor.<br>
<p>
I kept the ladders soaked in an oil bath, rather than the typical<br>
RTV/silicone coating, as I frequently needed to replace diodes.<br>
