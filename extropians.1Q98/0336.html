<p>
This is not valid.  You posit that if I attack you, I do so under the<br>
"threat" that you will defend yourself.  If I decided that you defending<br>
yourself was a significant threat to my attack, then the proper term would<br>
be "deterrent" (assuming basically rational players).  A deterrent is<br>
simply a "defensive threat" that is of significance to the attacker.<br>
Obviously when applied to government, individuals do not possess a<br>
deterrent capability since, at best, they represent a non-significant<br>
defensive threat to the government.  <br>
<p>
When the government is involved, individuals may represent a "threat", but<br>
never a "deterrent".  In a social interaction, there is *always* someone<br>
who can kick the aggressor's ass.<br>
