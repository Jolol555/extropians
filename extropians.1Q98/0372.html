I agree that it's a bad thing to violate a person or a contract (uh, duh),<br>
but even someone who doesn't agree with that would surely have to agree<br>
that to undertake such a violation is to do *something*, and that this<br>
something can be recognized as such.  If civil society is the sum of<br>
ongoing voluntaristic associations (for simplicity's sake, I'll let it go<br>
at that), then to violate a person or a contract is to "communicate" one's<br>
separation from that civil society.  Civil society properly responds to<br>
this "communication" by listening to it -- either literally separating the<br>
criminal from the society she or he has separated from by means of the<br>
violation (exile, imprisonment), or specifying the terms under which the<br>
criminal can return (restitution, rehabilitation).  I'll add that since a<br>
*robust* civil society would recognize the extent to which it thrives on<br>
diversity -- even such diversity as is represented by those who in moments<br>
of weakness or confusion or whatever temporarily fail to live up to its<br>
stipulations -- the terms for re-entry into civil society should be pretty<br>
generous.  I don't see why revenge should enter into these transactions at<br>
all particularly.  Best, Dale<br>
