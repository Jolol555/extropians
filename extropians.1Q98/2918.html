<p>
<p>
  IAN: Right, well-stated. To define crackpot<br>
  as such puts everyone to some degree and at <br>
  some time into that category. I think that the<br>
  dictionary definition of "crackpot" I cited is <br>
  good enough. Beyond that I'd define a crackpot<br>
  as someone who keeps promoting a theory and/<br>
  or claim to truth even though there is either<br>
  no evidence for such or overwhelming evidence <br>
  against such. This puts those who believe in <br>
  a Biblically defined God and those who believe<br>
  in a flat Earth into the "crackpot" category.<br>
  In sum: belief sans or contrary to evidence.<br>
<p>
  A crackpot is one who would be perpetrating <br>
  a fraud by promoting a claim except that they <br>
  are doing so due to some psychological fixa-<br>
  tion, such that they actually believe that <br>
  which they promote. People try to stuff the <br>
  TWA-800-missile theory into the "crackpot"<br>
  category because the Govt has rejected the<br>
  theory. However, if dozens of people saw a<br>
  streak of light rise up from the surface and <br>
  take the plane down, and if the directions <br>
  that these people point to when indicating<br>
  the "launch site" is the same spot, even as<br>
  these witness are spread across many miles,<br>
  that alone is sufficient evidence to prevent<br>
  the TWA800-missile theory from being defined<br>
  as a "crackpot" theory, not to mention that<br>
  it's heavily supported by physical evidence.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The difference between a crackpot and a non-crackpot making an </i><br>
<i>&gt;error is that the non-crackpot realizes the #1 reason for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"fatal flaw" is that they've misunderstood the theory. A non-</i><br>
<i>&gt;crackpot checks the literature and talks to people knowledgeable</i><br>
<i>&gt;about the theory, trying to see if this has already been addressed</i><br>
<i>&gt;somehow. A crackpot goes straight to the public.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: The problem I see with that definition <br>
  is that if X has an idea or theory and in-<br>
  stantly declares "Eureka" and goes public, <br>
  that fact alone does not mean the idea is <br>
  a false idea, and being false is a primary <br>
  prerequisite of "crackpotdom." <br>
<p>
  Also, defining a "crackpot" as someone who<br>
  runs out to proclaim a new idea prior to <br>
  getting all the facts is problematic to the<br>
  extent that nobody has all the facts, so if<br>
  that's the definition of "crackpot," then <br>
  everyone falls into the definition, more or<br>
  less, and that makes the term rather null.<br>
<p>
  Also, the idea that going public is bad<br>
  (in the age of the Internet) but going to<br>
  those with expertise first is good, is <br>
  problematic because going public on the <br>
  Internet may be the fastest way to reach <br>
  the largest numbers of experts, and there-<br>
  fore your definition leads to a contradic-<br>
  tion. The style of presenting an idea as <br>
  "this must be true," is also simply a bold <br>
  way of provoking counter argumentation --<br>
  such as "Oh ya..." -- which is, once again,<br>
  a means of seeking feedback from others.<br>
<p>
  I think that a "crackpot" is simply one<br>
  who promotes X where X is without and/or<br>
  contradicted by physical evidence, and <br>
  specifically who promotes it after such <br>
  evidentury problems have been made known.<br>
  And by that definition I proclaim that the<br>
  atomist theory of identity is "crackpot."<br>
