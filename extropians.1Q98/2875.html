This is not true. There are many things the Romans invented.<br>
Sure, they borrowed a lot.  All cultures do.  But to say that<br>
rome was not an inventor is a fallacy.  The arch is a good<br>
start.  As was an effective civil service, factory production<br>
lines, codified laws, etc. Greek civilisation was moribund and<br>
stagnant by the times the Romans marched in.  Rome is still an<br>
example to the world.  The fact that an empire so large was ruled<br>
effectively for so long (the imperial period was the longest<br>
continous peaceful period in Europe's history, by something like<br>
a factor of 5) with such an incredibly slow communicatiosn system<br>
suggests that they *did* invent something magnificent: how to<br>
govern such a widespread, diverse and numerous body of people.<br>

<i>&gt; It might be interesting to go back in time and prevent the rise of</i><br>

<p>
This is true, rome had an economic structure based on continual<br>
expansion.  This is what killed it more so than tax structure,<br>
that and environmental change.  It is interesting to look at the<br>
current economic ideology and it's reliance on continuous growth,<br>
and consider the fate of the Romans.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; .... The Americans didn't become a superpower</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; politicians were so intelligent, but because it was greatly funded by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; US.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Agree in part - but, you know, it wasn't by mere chance that Americans</i><br>
<i>&gt; won the wars.  </i><br>
<p>
Of course not.  They waited for the moment to jump in and attain<br>
the maximum return for the minimum effort. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why didn't Brazil (for example), which had similar</i><br>
<i>&gt; advantages of size and isolation, win them?</i><br>
<p>
Brazil in no way had the industrial base of the US. What a silly<br>
example.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I like to think it's not *only* military power that makes Americana</i><br>

<p>
What on earth makes you think "americana" is *fashionable*?? <br>
American military prowess and money are *desired* around the<br>
world, but "fashionable" "americana"??<br>
<p>
I find it amusing in the extreme that a collection of people who<br>
declare themselves anti-statist are defending the US so<br>
vigorously...<br>
