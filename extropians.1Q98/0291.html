I think you are kidding yourself when you are comparing internalized<br>
knowledge with an external database. Even a mental index of a treekiller<br>
library is much better than a hardcopy of it.  With an external database,<br>
you have the knowledge absorption bottleneck.<br>
<p>
This bottleneck is also my chief objection against the often claimed<br>
limitlessness of the human/machine synergy -- imo there are limits to how<br>
far even an optimal GUI can take us. Without gradual/incremental uploading<br>
there obviously cannot be a continuous, traversable trajectory to godhead.<br>
<p>
Bottlenecks can also cause a division into Us and Them (internal and<br>
external systems), which is at least deletorious, and can even provoke<br>
strife if the external systems grow too autonomous. Since we cannot claim<br>
to have their protean qualities, we would probably lose. <br>

Less tiring is certainly true. I know not how other people are feeling,<br>
but I choose firing up a search engine over a (often frustrating) session<br>
in the library, even if the scope is less broad, and the quality of<br>
obtained material dubitable. I've done some evangelizing about the virtues<br>
of the Internet and online publishing at the local faculty (Moscow State<br>
University, Polymer Science Dept.), but I have a strong feeling that the<br>
majority has still not grasped its full implications. Reluctancy to do<br>
some experimenting goes in hand with unreasonable expectations to find<br>
free high-quality online resources, imo a strange attitude for an<br>
ex-socialist culture. <br>
