The subject of first or at least early space colonies has developed out of the<br>
ocean enclave thread, with two basic issues being discussed: 1) how<br>
will/should the first space colonies be built 2) claiming of property off<br>
Earth and 3) where should they be situated.  (I leave the last subject for<br>
another post.)<br>

<p>
Even tongue in cheek, there are a couple of basic questions here: "Claiming"<br>
extraterrestrial territory or resources and what sort of launching platform,<br>
physical and otherwise, would be needed here on Earth for such an enterprise.<br>
<p>
As to "claiming" things off Earth, the only certain legal regime at this time<br>
is the UN Outer Space Treaty, which clearly prohibits claims of sovereignty<br>
over the territory in or zones of space.  This primary function of the UNOST<br>
is an artifact of Cold War rivalry but, in the mid- to long-term may well be<br>
one of the most important legacies of that period, keeping terrestrial nation<br>
states out of the business of legislating off Earth as much as we could hope<br>
for had we set up the legal regime ourselves.<br>
<p>
The treaty also provides for the possibility of private ownership of resources<br>
"extracted from" extraterrestrial objects, but makes no provision for private<br>
territorial property.  If you're interested in these subjects, a good overview<br>
of BASIC space law can be found in:<br>

The Archimedes Institute maintains a nice library of space law and space<br>
development materials at:<br>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.permanent.com/archimedes/">http://www.permanent.com/archimedes/</a><br>
<p>
Plans exist now for testing the regime of law that would govern claims that<br>
amount to private property in the "territory" of an asteroid.  The most<br>
developed such plans appears to be SpaceDev, Inc.'s "NEAP" (Near Earth<br>
Asteroid Prospector):<br>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.spacedev.com/">http://www.spacedev.com/</a><br>
<p>
NEAP will make a claim of ownership to the rock it visits, thereby explicitly<br>
attempting to set a precedent for such ownership claims elsewhere.  In this<br>
connection, the Archimedes Institute is attempting to establish a regime of<br>
property claims.  I recommend visiting their claim registry site, as they<br>
propose an interesting hierarchy of claims based on physical human visitation<br>
("Class A" claims), physical robotic visitation ("Class B" claims),<br>
observation of a previously unknown body ("Class C" claims) and any other kind<br>
of claim ("Class D" claims).  Claims of higher class trump claims of lower<br>
class and no claims for open space are provided for and are therefore<br>
presumably prohibited under the regime they propose.<br>
<p>
This seems like a well thought out, but very basic, framework for private<br>
territorial property rights.  Matters for further development would surely<br>
include the issue of lapsing of unused claims or, as we call it here on earth<br>
(err, I mean in the Anglo-American legal system), the law of "adverse<br>
possession".  As I think about it this morning, I can't see any reason why the<br>
existing body of law relating to adverse possession wouldn't work on<br>
extraterrestrial bodies, but of course that whole chain of thought leads<br>
immediately to the need for a juridical system for resolution of conflicting<br>
claims beyond the merest registry.  Nevertheless, a registry for claims is a<br>
vital first step.<br>
<p>
The bottom line: If you want some dirt off Earth, you gotta find it and go<br>
there.<br>
<p>
As to getting there, den Otter rightly points out that getting up out of this<br>
gravity well is the first step and that there might be a role for the maritime<br>
environment in that effort.  Fortunately, the last few years has seen a<br>
flowering of private development in this arena.  I've collected at least some<br>
links to such efforts in the launch systems section of my own space page, "The<br>
Deep Black":<br>
<p>

<p>
Boeing's Sea Launch program is premised on what has always been a natural<br>
connection between the maritime environment and space systems:<br>
<p>

<p>
Launch vehicles and their associated equipment are BIG machines and no better<br>
medium exists for moving large masses of stuff on Earth than the ocean.<br>
Likewise, boosters continue to have a nasty habit of careening off course and<br>
blowing up, so doing things at sea or near it is also a good idea.  Sea Launch<br>
takes advantage of both factors and adds a third, offering the ability to<br>
position their launch platform just about anywhere they can find sufficient<br>
draft and decent weather.  They will loft a Hughes satellite aboard a Russian-<br>
built Zenit booster off of their Norwegian-built semi-submersible mobile<br>
launch platform from the equatorial seas south of Hawaii some time this year.<br>
The use of a mobile semi-sub employing buoyancy, stability and positioning<br>
technology proven in the offshore drilling field is brilliant.  And best of<br>
all, although this is BIG business, it's by and large non-governmental and<br>
will be available for hire.  It's possible (but I think unlikely) that someone<br>
else will try the same thing.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, more exotic land-based launch systems are moving ahead from design<br>
to implementation.  The Rotary Rocket project and a couple of innovative<br>
spaceplanes will be making LEO much more accessible in the 2005-2015 time<br>
period, at least for relatively small payloads.<br>
