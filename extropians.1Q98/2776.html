Nice, but huperzine doesn't strike me as that wonderful really. It is<br>
just a new acetylcholinestrase inhibitor. Of course, it opens up the<br>
possibilities of a new spectrum of AChIs and might exist in a<br>
convenient form, but I still think manipulating the ACh levels is a<br>
fairly crude way of modulating memory (you temporarily increase<br>
learning *and* forgetting, at least in my memory model). I want<br>
something more specific, ideally active during memory<br>
consolidation... hmm, anybody trying nootropics just before going to<br>
bed?<br>

[ The original article Eugene cited seems awfully close to an<br>
advertisment for General Nutrition Corp. Its scientific content was<br>
not very strong, the usual bunch of medline abstracts mixing animal<br>
and Alzheimer studies with impossible-to-find articles that give<br>
nootropics a bad name among sceptics. Sure, huperzine likely has the<br>
effects the abstracts point at, but that doesn't make it a good<br>
nootropic. ]<br>
