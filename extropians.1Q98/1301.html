Untrue. I have never encountered, nor have I ever heard of anyone who has<br>
encountered, a valid 680x0 (not 86xxx, btw) instruction that did not run<br>
correctly on a PPC chip (albeit in emulation).<br>
<p>
As to your assertions re Rhapsody - the "Blue Box" layer of Rhapsody is a<br>
fully-implemented MacOS layer. "Yellow Box" provides a similar<br>
implementation layer for Windows 95 and NT. Note that these are fully<br>
native implementations, not emulation layers. That means that a machine<br>
running Rhapsody OS can run MacOS native apps, Windows NT apps and Rhapsody<br>
apps, all at the same time.<br>
<p>
Rhapsody is being developed in versions that run on both PPC and Intel<br>
chipsets (and perhaps some others as well...). Rhapsody coded apps should<br>
be fully portable between processors - everything I've seen so far leads me<br>
to believe that Apple can accomplish this and will do so ontime or darn<br>
near to it.<br>
<p>
 I'd go on but a) this topic isn't really salient to this list, and b) I'm<br>
under NDA and really shouldn't get too enthusiastic about sharing what I've<br>
been working with til it's released.<br>

Anyone interested in Rhaposody should check out<br>
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macos/rhapsody/">http://www.apple.com/macos/rhapsody/</a> for starters.<br>

<i>&gt;If something is "99.999%" compatible and executes thousands of</i><br>

<i>&gt;incompatibility issue?</i><br>
<p>
Depends. If an instruction that can cause an error is rarely called, then<br>
it may be years or never at all. It's not like a computer executes every<br>
possible instruction just for yucks.<br>
