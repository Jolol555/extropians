What he was trying to show is that no one man who wasn't in a position of<br>
authority in a government has ever been able to pull off the kind of power stunts<br>
he listed, Indonesia's claims about George Soros aside (which is simply more<br>
tyrannic fear mongering). Take Bill Gate's for example. He's the richest guy on<br>
the planet, yet if the DOJ gets the supreme court to tell him to hup too, he'll be<br>
a shuckin' and a jivin' like any bum on the street pushing an idiot stick.<br>
Somebody like Clinton, on the other hand, can evade civil litigation, criminal<br>
investigation and prosecution, having both his former best freind as well as his<br>
Commerce Secretary assasinated, do FBI background checks on 300 private citizens<br>
with no due process or probable cause, while taking more bribe money than any<br>
organization man in history as well as bombing and invading a few countries while<br>
he was at it, yet Clinton is worth tops, maybe $2 million personally (and bankrupt<br>
if you talk to his accountant). Tell me that government doesn't give people in<br>
authority excessive power.<br>

Actually, despite the nasty rumors of the European Powers, medeival europe was a<br>

around.<br>
