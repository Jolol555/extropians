<p>
All the pitfalls you mention do exist.<br>
<p>
Nonetheless, all the studies you've mentioned sound to me as if they lack<br>
enough of an individual motivator to really test the creativity hypothesis.<br>
Set and setting, remember?<br>
<p>
But if all a truly creative person lacks is just a _little_ tweak to their<br>
serotonin and dopamine sites, and they apply their changed state to<br>
projects which truly matter to them...<br>
how to test that?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm very wary about doing hedonic engineering (or deep</i><br>
<i>&gt;metaprogramming) without *very* careful planning. </i><br>
<p>
Eminently reasonable. And not contradicted by anything I've said. :) I did<br>
_fail_ to say that. The people I know who get value are people who do<br>
indeed plan before they act. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When you modify your</i><br>
<i>&gt;own motivational structure, you can easily get trapped in unexpected</i><br>
<i>&gt;or unplanned behavior-attractors. These attractors will since they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;attractors, appear natural or pleasant for you, but they might not be</i><br>
<i>&gt;in accordance with your original goals.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed. This is particularly at issue because cannabis appears to affect<br>
what I call "flow of the first kind"--absorption. A consequence of this is<br>
that one can become absorbed in _anything_, and if one has an agenda, it's<br>
important to check for mismatch during the experience and redirect<br>
attention appropriately.<br>
<p>
It's also important to get perspective by comparing your results with your<br>
intentions _after_ you're back at baseline.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, flow of the first kind is _rudimentary_ flow. I have a lot<br>
more to say about this, but it's not ready for publication yet. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I</i><br>
<i>&gt;worry about is that so many simply accept that the subjective very</i><br>
<i>&gt;positive results correspond with real positive results</i><br>
<p>
That's a toughie, because of the set and setting issues. White lab coats<br>
and arbitrary goals can squeeze all the results flat. The missing piece<br>
here is, I suspect, a kind of discipline that some so-inclined people<br>
manage to work out for themselves. Codifying this as part of a long-term<br>
study might provide more evidence than was obtained feeding students<br>
cookies in a lab and giving them a test.<br>
