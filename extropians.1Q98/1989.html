Actually, I was disappointed with the episode.  Of course, I loved<br>
seeing an episode written by Cyberpunk authors.  I enjoyed seeing<br>
similarities with their previous work.<br>
<p>
INVISIGOTH was rude to Scully, saying that she was too dumb to<br>
understand the network.  Unfortuneately, she didn't really get to<br>
demonstrate any great skill in the episode.  She didn't do anything<br>
special or figure anything out to solve the case.  She just stated that<br>
she was a superior intelligence without demonstrating it.<br>
<p>
The hacker friends of Mulder quoted ancient history in Computer Lore and<br>
then seemed to approve of INVISIGOTH because she was "hot".  They didn't<br>
analyze how great her work was, except in the vaguest of terms as being<br>
"very advanced".  I wish they would have demonstrated more to the<br>
audience.<br>
<p>
At one point they needed "someone in the Government" to track down the<br>
T3 connection.  Shouldn't the network/hackers/cyberpunks have been able<br>
to do that?  This probably was a plot device to allow Mulder to track<br>
down the chicken-farm trailer and get there first, but if a non-network<br>
government man can trace a network connection to its source faster than<br>
the cyberpunk/chic who wants to upload and live in the net, then it<br>
doesn't show a superior knowledge of the network.<br>
<p>
I also wish the street-smart attitude was explained as resulting from<br>
hiding from the government and/or avoiding industrial espionage. <br>
Without a proper background explanation, INIVISIGOTH appeared to be a<br>
homeless corporate drop-out living in a box and surfing the net all<br>
day.  She also didn't appear very street smart to me, just tough and<br>
rude.  She played her music so loud that Mulder and Scully could zoom in<br>
right to her box, etc.  She had no defenses and could be completely<br>
taken over by Mulder and Scully with a handgun.<br>
<p>
I also wish there was more technology being used by the cyberpunks. <br>
Except for their connections to the Internet and their taking-over of<br>
other people's computers and satellites, they didn't seem to have much<br>
of their own personal stuff.  I wish they would have faught back more<br>
via the computer and network, and relied less on guns, handcuffs, and<br>
FBI agents to respond.  When the satellite was zooming in, I wish they<br>
would have faught back on the computer more.  I wish there were more<br>
weapons than the telephone calls in the beginning and the satellite.  I<br>
wish the network entity could track them by credit card purchases,<br>
cameras in stores, records in the FBI, or anything more than just<br>
tapping their phone line.  As long as they stayed off the phone, the<br>
network entity was helpless, which is unrealistic given how much of our<br>
lives are recorded by computers.<br>
<p>
I know I'm being picky.  I loved the episode for personal reasons. <br>
However, as a tool to educate the public, I don't expect nonExtropians<br>
to have learned much if anything from this episode.  It didn't<br>
demonstrate or prove any points.  It just alluded to most things that<br>
only insiders applauded with all their ramifications.  Outsiders just<br>
watched with little interest.<br>
<p>
Of course as Dennis Miller says, That's just my opinion...  I could be<br>
wrong...  (Maybe I'm just greedy and want more, more, more!)<br>
