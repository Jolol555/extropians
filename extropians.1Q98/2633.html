<i>&gt; &gt; British merely overlaid systems of parliamentary government, judicial systems, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; undertook to educate the best and brightest of the natives. If you looked at a list of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; countries today that were once British colonies, and compared them to the former colonies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of other former great powers, you would find that the former British colonies are today</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; much more stable, and developed economically, politically, and culturally, by and large.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Just curious:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Given that, as you say above, the British colonised north america and australia in the "early</i><br>
<i>&gt; period", which countries did it colonise later?</i><br>
<p>
India, Ceylon, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Rhodesia, Belize (then British Honduras), Pakistan,<br>
Bangladesh, Burma.<br>
<p>
India and SA are notably the nations still in the best shape, and which took to being colonized<br>
rather well. While SA had the Dutch blight of apartheid to deal with, it is coming out of it<br>
rather nicely (note that that did not exist until SA was indpendent), India on the other hand is<br>
the shining light of the third world for stability and industry, as well as cultural diversity.<br>
