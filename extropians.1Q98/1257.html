Could someone please give me some good examples of how private scientific<br>
research is "better"(interpret that as you will) than public research.  I<br>
am presently involved in a debate with my university peers and professors,<br>
and I need some more ammunition.<br>
<p>
The following e-mail is an example a response against my argument.  I am<br>
arguing in  particular that private research is better, and that only<br>
private universities should have tenure, since researchers at public<br>
universities should be held accountable to the public.<br>
<p>
Thanks a lot,<br>
<p>
Geoff.<br>
<p>
(ps. feel free to aim your arguments specifically at the e-mail below...)<br>

<i>&gt; Date: Wednesday, January 28, 1998 8:00 AM</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dear Sci-Oners, SOSers, et al,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Let me `wet my oars' this Science Week with four brief comments in</i><br>
<i>&gt; support of unfettered pure research in the continuing debate about</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Point 1. The laser was not `invented' from the need for new surgical</i><br>
<i>&gt; instruments, nor the nanotube from the need of new fibres, nor radar</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the need to detect enemy aircraft, nor the chip for the purpose</i><br>
<i>&gt; of miniaturization, nor, nor, .....</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most fundamental advances have emerged from `pure' curiosity-driven</i><br>
<i>&gt; research, not from goal-directed pursuits. The rapid publication of</i><br>
<i>&gt; unfettered research in the open literature leads to its free use for</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological development by business, industry, government or</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual entrepreneurs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Point 2. The Private Sector is inefficient at producing basic advances</i><br>
<i>&gt; because of the proprietary secrecy and patenting which accompanies</i><br>
<i>&gt; it. This secrecy leads to considerable duplication of research effort</i><br>
<i>&gt; across an industry, such as pharmaceuticals. It is because such research</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not openly published for all to take advantage of, that I think such</i><br>
<i>&gt; research has no place at a university. [Suppose the laser had been</i><br>
<i>&gt; invented by Laser Corporation: they would have kept silent about it</i><br>
<i>&gt; until all THEIR ideas were patented, and we would have missed-out on</i><br>
<i>&gt; most of the developments of the laser these past 38 years.]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3. Industry tends to be short on altruism: the CEO of a major</i><br>
<i>&gt; automobile manufacturer said recently, "we are not here to make cars</i><br>
<i>&gt; or employ people, but simply to make money for our shareholders,</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever it takes". And just this week, MacBlo closed its R &amp; D</i><br>
<i>&gt; centre in Burnaby because of short-term bottom-line myopia.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 4. We, the public, pay for Government operations through `tax'</i><br>
<i>&gt; dollars and for the Private Sector with `after-tax' dollars (as</i><br>
<i>&gt; consumers). Why do we seem to get so hot under the collar about a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; dollars spent by governments on pure research at universities, while</i><br>
<i>&gt; shrugging our shoulders at the excesses and extravagances of major</i><br>
<i>&gt; businesses and industries -- whose costs we absorb on the ticket of</i><br>
<i>&gt; items such as food, housing, travel, hair-dying and E-mailing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Gung hay fat choy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
