Personal Computers were designed as multipurpose machines, yet all<br>
mine seems to do is run software!  Windows 95, a huge monolith of a<br>
program, does nothing more than DOS.  It may contain libraries of code<br>
used by the programs that it runs, but it does nothing else but run<br>
them.  Its interface is so minimalist - a start bar, some windows -<br>
that I would be happy saying it doesn't have one.<br>
<p>
My operating system on the other hand (let's call it Wax OS) is truly<br>
multipurpose.  You can take it home, install it, boot up, and write a<br>
letter.  Or, for that matter, any number of other things without once<br>
having to stop to buy software.  The interface is a work of art - it<br>
dynamically represents interaction between the user and a document<br>
(and nothing more.)  This isn't a "graphic" interface this is a<br>
"visual" interface.  If you can load a document and you can edit it,<br>
these two processes are now the same.  The document IS the interface,<br>
and the interface IS the application.<br>
<p>
The "document" can be anything from some text to Quake 2, the<br>
interface is a bunch of components that are visually represented, and<br>
the application is a combination of the two.<br>
<p>
User-centric Design<br>
