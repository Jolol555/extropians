<i>&gt; &gt; I use animated GIFs,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But why? I've yet to see more than a couple of animated GIFs that are</i><br>
<i>&gt; worth downloading. Most of them take an age to download and then sit</i><br>
<i>&gt; there wasting my CPU time. I use Netscape for research while I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; compiling drivers, and the last thing I want is to waste 95% of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; available CPU cycles on some pointless 'ain't this cute' animated</i><br>
<i>&gt; graphic.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know what modem speed you are using. I'm on a 33.6, but usually I'm hooked up at<br>
24.4-28.8k, and I have no problems, unless a page is just full of animation. However,<br>
I've noticed that shockwave graphics are much faster. If you are at 256k, geez, cut your<br>
whining. Unless its a VR presentation, if you are having speed problems, then its cause<br>
your video card can't handle it, its not your CPU. Get a matrox card<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;as well as only java that is usable on all major browsers (ALHPABrowser,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;btw,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in the words of its lead programmer to me: "gracefully ignores java", which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fine for a dumb terminal network environment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Except when you hit a web site which refuses to work if you don't run</i><br>
<i>&gt; Java, but gives you a 'helpful' little 'click here to download Internet</i><br>
<i>&gt; Explorer' button.</i><br>
<p>
I know, that is a complaint I also have. People should use open standards or none at<br>
all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;However, I will remind you that most business on the web is done in a graphical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;environment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And my web-browsing is under (cough, spit, ack) Windows 95/98 over a 256k</i><br>
<i>&gt; link with a stonkingly fast 2D/3D graphics accelerator. But that doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; mean that I want to waste 90% of the time downloading pointless images. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually use the Net for finding information; and I want to find that</i><br>
<i>&gt; information as fast as possible, not sit back and watch the scenery go</i><br>
<i>&gt; by. Not to mention that I'm one of the people who do actually *buy*</i><br>
<i>&gt; things over the Web, rather than just window-shop.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
If you look at your resource meter while you are loading pages, unless your computer is<br>
slower than a 133 Pentium, they will take a small fraction of its resources. Win98 alone<br>
would take up much more space....  I take it that 98 is a dog?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Those of you who are still stuck in ascii-land are WAY behind the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;curve, sorry to say. Now, it has its place, but still, you shouldn't be driving</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;your Yugo on the Autobahn at 45 mph and expect me to slow down my Passat, &gt;Volvo,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;SAAB, BMW, or even a Ferrari, down for you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; No, you have the analogy completely backwards. Netscape with Java, Shockwave</i><br>
<i>&gt; and all the other cack is the Yugo; my browser with all that disabled is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ferrari. If I want some information I hit full throttle and blast through the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Web to it, getting annoyed when some stupid 'neat graphics, huh?' site forces</i><br>
<i>&gt; me to slow down.</i><br>
<p>
I dunno, gabo's corp site loads rather quickly over my 33.6 link, and runs very quickly.<br>
If he actually used it for presenting information other than to sell his webauthroing<br>
services, it would be awesome. If it didn't require the shockwave plugin to run, it<br>
would be even better, but shockwave is rather widely used, so its really not that big of<br>
a deal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This, I think, is where Gibson's cyberpunk went hideously wrong. The future</i><br>
<i>&gt; console cowboys won't be using slow, CPU-consuming 3D VR interfaces; they'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; be reserved for the normal folks, and the hackers will be using command line</i><br>
<i>&gt; interfaces so they can stay close to the machine.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, some will use commands to control the backgrounds, but the interfaces will be mind<br>
generated interpreting simple markup commands which speak volumes when referencing<br>
already loaded, commonly used kernels. Vinge's True Names was the most accurate, though<br>
I doubt that one could actually suffer any damage other than an epileptic seizure from<br>
an attack over VR.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Why, because all those cobol programmers reading their email in vi, browsing &gt;with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;lynx,  etc on their 3151 unix terminals, who make $100,000 plus a year and need &gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;shop from the computer are too stubborn to get with the technological curve?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Depending on where I am, I read my mail with vi, pine, Netscape, Internet</i><br>
<i>&gt; Explorer, Privtool, Microsoft Outlook (cough, split, ack), elm, /bin/mail</i><br>
<i>&gt; or 'more /usr/spool/mqueue/df*'. I much prefer pine because it's fast and</i><br>
<i>&gt; simple; I'm just too stubborn to waste my time with pointless fancy graphics</i><br>
<i>&gt; when I'm looking for information.</i><br>
<p>
Ever hear the saying "A picture is worth a thousand words"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Commerce on the net comes from selling unique products to many people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Ascii is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;horrendous sales medium.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why? I want a copy of Adobe Premiere; what do I need other than price</i><br>
<i>&gt; and availability?</i><br>
<p>
If you've not heard anythign about it but mail list gossip, I would hope that you did a<br>
little more research than just going to the site to buy it. Maybe you like blowing money<br>
on things you may not use. I don't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I mean, seriously, what do I gain from spending five minutes downloading</i><br>
<i>&gt; some huge animated presentation when I just want to find the cheapest</i><br>
<i>&gt; supplier and hand over my credit card number? Particularly when Netscape</i><br>
<i>&gt; will probably tell me that I don't have the right plug-in, make me waste</i><br>
<i>&gt; ten minutes downloading that, then after installing tell me that I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to reboot my machine!</i><br>
<p>
If you are at 256k connection, I sure hope that that is one hell of a demo if it takes<br>
you 5 minutes to download.  Thats a 10 meg file, compressed. As much as 100 megs of<br>
programming unpacked.--<br>
