There are two separate problems here. One is to verify that the <br>
machine functions as it is supposed to. The thought experiment <br>
assumes that this is possible. Another problem is to make sure that <br>
the criminal code, compliance with which the subject is tested for, <br>
is a good criminal code. (As long as there is free entry and exit <br>
from a society, then libertarians would presumably not have anything <br>
against a "Stalin-spaceship" (using Hal's spaceship terminology), <br>
where people could sign in who wanted to live under a Stalinisque <br>
dictature with perfect mind-scanning techniques. This does not mean, <br>
of course, that the Stalin-spaceship would be a "good" society, one <br>
where the libertarians would want to live.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another problem: someone commits a heinous crime, then doses eirself with</i><br>
<i>&gt; (say) a Rohypnol-Scopolamine cocktail that scrambles long term memory</i><br>
<i>&gt; fixation. Chemically-induced amnesia. What does a brain scan reveal?</i><br>
<p>
Realistically, mind-scans will probably not be possible until we are <br>
digital, and then it would be even easier to forget at will. So one <br>
could only scan for evil intentions, not for memories of commited <br>
crimes.<br>
<p>
One can imagine a sci-fi plot as follows. A wants to become The <br>
Leader, but every candidate for the leader role will have to undergo <br>
repeated psycho-scans. So A splits into B and C. B is designed to run <br>
for the presidency with pure methods and a good intentions. C  on <br>
the other hand will break into the opposition canditate office and <br>
plant false evidence of some scandalous event. In the end, B becomes <br>
president, and, having only socially accepted intentions, hunts C <br>
down and puts him in prison.<br>
