Ahh, the "copy paradox" again. <br>
We seem to inevitably run into this when discussing uploading. IMHO, it<br>
cannot be resolved with our present knowledge, since we seem to arrive at<br>
different conclusions when deciding if the uploaded mind is "you" or<br>
"someone else", depending on how (by which criteria) we distinguish "you"<br>
from "anybody else". See the mailing list archive for threads on this<br>
topic.<br>
<p>
Bye, <br>
         F.P.<br>
<p>
P.S.: Lem (who else could it be :-) has already discussed this in his<br>
"Dialogs" as early as 1961. Can't remember, however, at what conclusions<br>
he arrived, have to re-read it.<br>
