Erik,<br>
<p>
	I think you will find that most, or all individuals on this list share<br>
your concerns of state interference with personal choice matters (drugs,<br>
etc); and that most, or all are also appalled at the depths to which<br>
GOVERNMENTS have sunk. <br>
	Your nightmare scenario of funcloning is close to what I would envision if<br>
elitists (governments) are left in control of technologies such as cloning<br>
(FDA). Except in the case of the elitists I see the technology being used<br>
to create and control soldiers who are never exposed to any social<br>
interaction beyond their highly trained tightly knit units. I wonder if,<br>
without any interaction with average individuals, these clones would have a<br>
normal resistance to initiating violence. Sadly, the past points to many<br>
examples of people who were raised in semi civil societies turning out<br>
extremely violent due to destructive memes ( fascism, socialism, statism,<br>
luddism). Just imagine what the Marine of the future could be like!<br>
	Due to the above argument, I propose that the future will be much safer<br>
with cloning available on the free market rather than controlled by the<br>
elite. It is kinda like computers; the more widespread and available they<br>
are, the less likely it is that they will be used to oppress us.<br>
	You seem to speak out of both sides of your mouth when you rail against a<br>
prison state and attack the freemarket in the same letter. If not a<br>
freemarket what? A prison market?<br>
	Here's the applicable quote for the day: <br>
"It's a far easier thing to have a firm anchor in ignorance than to set out<br>
on the troubled seas of thought."<br>
	I have no clue who I am quoting, just felt it fit in with any response to<br>
your letter.<br>

<i>&gt; From: Erik Moeller &lt;flagg@oberberg-online.de&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; To: extropians@extropy.com</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject: The Cloning Debate (again)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Date: Saturday, January 10, 1998 1:27 PM</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Of course this is perfectly in the line of</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking of a free market capitalist. In his view, humans have always</i><br>
been<br>
<i>&gt; products, and this is also true even today. We prostitute ourselves when</i><br>
we<br>
<i>&gt; offer our services for money, making us loan-slaves. If we don't agree</i><br>
with a<br>
<i>&gt; society of loan-slavery, we must either depend on charity (provided by</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; state or local organizations in an always decreasing level) or starve.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And a human is just a product.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which means, of course, that the clone we've bought might be a nice toy</i><br>
today,<br>
<i>&gt; especially if it's made of DNA of a famous personality. But it might get</i><br>
<i>&gt; boring tomorrow and be disposed. You'd buy a clone not because you want a</i><br>
<i>&gt; child, but because you want a toy. And who keeps his modern teddy bear</i><br>
<i>&gt; forever? Who cares for it when you don't want it anymore? Would you send</i><br>
your<br>
<i>&gt; teddy bear to a school? No? So what does the clone do when he has grown</i><br>
up and<br>
<i>&gt; nobody wants him anymore?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, history has shown what humans can do to other humans when they're</i><br>
given<br>
<i>&gt; the right to do whatever they want to do to them. For example, at times</i><br>
war.<br>
<i>&gt; In WW II, a brothel was created for female Jews who were later (after</i><br>
being<br>
<i>&gt; used, as the products they had become) disposed in the gas chambers. Ah,</i><br>
I<br>
<i>&gt; guess we'll find some fellows who doubt this on this funny little mailing</i><br>
<i>&gt; list, too. After all, you seriously discuss "child rearing" and the right</i><br>
for<br>
<i>&gt; the possession of guns here. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Back to the present. The main problem with free cloning is what I've</i><br>
described<br>
<i>&gt; as "Funcloning" in my article. Clones as products/toys for a privileged</i><br>
(for<br>
<i>&gt; biological cloning will always be expensive) minority seem much more</i><br>
likely<br>
<i>&gt; than clones as a good means of reproduction for infertile humans or</i><br>
homosexual<br>
<i>&gt; pairs. In addition, even clones used in deadly gameshows are imaginable.</i><br>
Or in<br>
<i>&gt; a human zoo.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Already today, humans are enslaved in American prisons to provide</i><br>
services.<br>
<i>&gt; These prisons are getting a major competitor on the free market. And what</i><br>
do<br>
<i>&gt; you do when you need more workers? You recruit them, by spreading a</i><br>
little<br>
<i>&gt; crack or selling a few weapons and having the police already at hand when</i><br>
it<br>
<i>&gt; gets interesting. A prison state is not just a dark fantasy anymore, some</i><br>
<i>&gt; already *call* America a prison state.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Eugene Leitl, you have described what I call Funcloning as "neoluddism".</i><br>
<i>&gt; Another fancy keyword. But who's the one who has fun here? Progess is</i><br>
fine.<br>
<i>&gt; Cloning is OK if it is used by those who need it. But humans must not be</i><br>
made<br>
<i>&gt; more product-like than they already are. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Otherwise your beloved singularity will remain a wet dream for your</i><br>
lifetime.<br>
