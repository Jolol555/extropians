Yes, and what this advantage is is not really clear. As with many<br>
objectionable things, there are reasons for their existence, and until<br>
these reasons are known, it is not possible to design better<br>
alternatives.<br>
<p>
So far, I haven't heard much on this that makes much sense. The<br>
Extropian knee-jerk libertarian and privatization notions just don't<br>
quite cut it for me, and I admit I am a bit unclear as to why. I could<br>
post a list of annoying questions, and expect that I would get lots of<br>
references to the anarchic and libertarian press, but AFAIK, these ideas<br>
don't seem to be very popular, and seem even harder to implement. I<br>
suspect this difficulty lies in other areas than libertarianism or the<br>
free market. My tendency is to think in terms of depth psychology, but<br>
that too has its problems.<br>
<p>
So, what is the REAL function of gummint monsters?? Really..<br>
