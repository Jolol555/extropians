No; nobody has solved the problem. I assert, however, the libertarians<br>
_should_ be interested in the issues, because if they _can_ propose a<br>
workable solution they'll gain a lot of converts from among the (large!)<br>
body of people who agree that the current system ain't working, who<br>
don't like big government, but who don't think that an unrestricted<br>
free market is the ideal answer. Otherwise, all you're going to do is<br>
carry on preaching to the choir.<br>

It works better than any of the known alternatives, I'll concede that<br>
much. Question: why the hell isn't anyone looking for new, hitherto-unknown,<br>
alternatives?<br>
