<i>&gt;You're really grasping at straws at this point.  Several areas on </i><br>
<i>&gt;earth (old world civilized floodplains) have had their natural </i><br>
<i>&gt;ecosystems obliterated millenia ago, and apart from salinization</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the Tigris-euphrates system, they all work fine.  You also</i><br>
<i>&gt;omitted my point that our current crops have been well</i><br>
<i>&gt;demonstrated to have no need at all for biodiversity.</i><br>
<p>
I would take issue with the idea that our current crops have<br>
demonstrated there is no need for biodiversity. As I am part Irish,<br>
I will remind you of the historical lesson of the potato famine of<br>
1847 (remember less we repeat). The vast portion of the country was<br>
dependent on a single strain of potato, the "lumper." When a blight<br>
was accidently introduced the whole country was devasted, millions<br>
died or fled. Agricultural experts around the world warn daily that<br>
we are repeating this historical mistake.<br>
<p>
 I share your admiration of hydroponic/nutrient film techniques<br>
however.<br>
<p>
 The "smart-money" is taking a different course than the one we<br>
have been talking about so far.<br>
<p>
Enter the new agricultural world spawned by the hobbyists known as<br>
"heirloom gardeners." In searching for the fondly remembered fruits<br>
and vegetables of their youth, groups of gardeners have been<br>
searching out the varieties they seek amongst various ethnic<br>
groups. These seeds have been contiually propagated and passed from<br>
generation to generation, hence the name "Heirloom."<br>
<p>
To these people biodiversity is everything. Heirloom seed<br>
catalogues list hundreds of varieties of such simple things as<br>
beans, corn, or tomatoes. (and yes potato's!) Not only have they<br>
mamaged to preserve and repropagate these plants but they are<br>
creating new varieties that self-polinate. (non-hybrid)<br>
<p>
Where is this headed? Not only are new seed companies being<br>
created, reversing a disturbing trend, but they are selling and<br>
growing these varietys. Farmers, forced to change by current<br>
economics, are turning to these techniques, growing new, and old<br>
varietys all of which offer better taste and nutrition. Former<br>
hobbists, the heirloom gardeners are now becoming "market<br>
gardeners" growing large quantities under contract for specific<br>
restaurants. Here in northern Illinois farms that were close to<br>
being lost are expanding to meet the ever growing demand for these<br>
products, enjoying the advantage of being close to there market,<br>
and earning greater profits on these high value added items. <br>
<p>
<p>
This is a global, multicultural trend, good news all around I'd<br>
say. <br>
