<i>&gt;  Making the ability to experience pain an important basis for respecting</i><br>

<i>&gt; dissimilar to us experience makes it easy for people who rely on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; rule to rationalize almost any treatment of those beings that happens</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be convenient. How does your moral system handle these:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  - fish</i><br>
<i>&gt;  - clams</i><br>
<i>&gt;  - humans genetically engineered so they say they feel no emotional</i><br>
<i>&gt;  reaction to things that would be painful to us</i><br>
<i>&gt;  - uploaded humans</i><br>
<i>&gt;  - AIs</i><br>

All excellent points.  I'm still not sure whether I think we should regard<br>
another's pain as a kind of "rights" claim.  I think it may be disastrous<br>
to extend the rights framework in this way.  Part of the problem with<br>
treating pain as the ethical ground-zero disvalue is that it suggests we<br>
might achieve utopia simply by anesthetizing the world.  Clearly, pain<br>
stands in too complicated a relation to pleasure, achievement, and<br>
flourishing to reject it out of hand.  Further, there is something<br>
patronizing about carping constantly about the suffering of others,<br>
without speaking about their capacity for joy and self-reliance.<br>
Nevertheless, I think *indifference* to suffering is crippling to the<br>
spirit.  Sometimes (as with medical experimentation) it may be necessary<br>
to value the benefits of nonhuman animal exploitation over our sensitivity<br>
to their pain -- however, I think it is a kind of blindness to the rich<br>
range of possible values to treat this state of affairs as one without<br>
costs both to the exploited animals *and to ourselves*. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  My idea of a moral rule that can handle these better is based on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ability to agree to respect each others rights. However, I'm still</i><br>
<i>&gt; dissatisfied with the difficulties in dealing with beings who can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; communicate well with us.</i><br>
<p>
Me too.  It is only in articulating my intuitions here that I realize how<br>
unsatisfied I really am about these issues and how best to think them<br>
through.  Best, Dale<br>
