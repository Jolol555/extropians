Yes, I have found that with the exception of large environmental disasters<br>
(which wouldn't have occured if governments had not been in collusion with<br>
and sheilded big corporations in the first place), most environmental<br>
protection is more effective if it is done by individuals working on their<br>
own property with their own assets. Private land trusts have done more to<br>
protect wilderness here in the Northeast US far more than the federal<br>
government has. It also allows for more neighborliness.<br>
