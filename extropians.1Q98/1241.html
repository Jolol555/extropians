Smiley or not, try this thought-experiement on for size:  No, go ahead,<br>
think of it as a *cow*, a "device" which experiences a great deal of<br>
absolutely unecessary suffering so as to satisfy your unhealthy hankering<br>
after the sensation of its "tang" on your tongue and its corpse rotting<br>
away in your tummy.  Concerns on the list about how sentient machines will<br>
be treated in the future are well justified by awareness of the ways in<br>
which sentient machines like nonhuman animals (not to mention most human<br>
ones) are treated in the present.  Uh, the vegetarian meme marches on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The whole "diet for a small planet" mantra reminds me of Karl Marx</i><br>
<i>&gt; spending time in England and coming to the conclusion that production</i><br>
<i>&gt; was everything because the transportation and distribution system was</i><br>
<i>&gt; so well-developed (comparatively) that he didn't even notice it.</i><br>
<p>
The whole carnivorist mantra reminds me of nothing so much as the<br>
transparent rationalizations for self-destructive and morally<br>
indifferent behavior one finds tripping from the mouths of any substance<br>
abuser you happen to meet.  And the same judgments apply, as far as I'm<br>
concerned: Should be legal, morally shunned, and laughed at as stupid.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; p.s. skip the veggie flames please.  I eat very little meat and have</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost completely given it up for health reasons, but spent most of</i><br>
<i>&gt; my childhood on a farm I know that the only reason cattle, sheep, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; most livestock exist in the world today are because we keep them</i><br>
<i>&gt; alive.  If it were not to become burgers and steaks then cows would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have long since become another evolutionary dead-end (you cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite appreciate just how dumb these animals have been bred until you</i><br>
<i>&gt; watch sheep trying to get out of the rain by hiding under the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; sheep.)</i><br>
<p>
PS: Sorry for the veggie flame-broiling.  I daresay a meat-cow would just<br>
as soon become a literal evolutionary dead-end then experience the<br>
privilege of prolonged abuse and subsequent consumption. <br>
<p>
Best, Dale  <br>
