I stand by my position. Hummel points out that the return on an<br>
investment in slaves ranged between 8 to 12 per cent, comparable to the<br>
return on capital from an investment in railroads or textile mills.<br>
<p>
You are wrong in assuming that slavery absorbed investment income. <br>
Slavery just resulted in a transfer of funds from slaveowners to<br>
slavetraders. Trading slaves no more absorbed savings than trading land<br>
or any other real asset.<br>
<p>
The lack of industrialization in the South did not reflect a cost of<br>
slavery. Even without slavery, it still would have been more beneficial<br>
for the South to specialize in agriculture. It's extremely unlikely<br>
textile mills would have sprung up in Mississippi even with a totally<br>
free labor market.<br>
<p>
Most of the benefits of the vastly improved productivity of Northern<br>
factories accrued to consumers in the form of lower prices. Investors<br>
benefitted, but no more so than Southern slaveholders.<br>
<p>
Why in the world would well educated Southerners invest in slaves if<br>
they could receive a far higher return on their money by investing in<br>
Northern factories or other investments? You are arguing that they were<br>
fools, totally unaware of business and markets. I disagree. <br>
