MEMES<br>
=====<br>
<p>
Richard Dawkins wrote 'The Selfish Gene,'<br>
with the theme that genes are in control<br>
and that human bodies are "gene machines"<br>
for the purpose of propagating genes.  See<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0192860925/4698-6991464-074818">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0192860925/4698-6991464-074818</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
At the end of his book Dawkins introduced<br>
the notion of "memes."  A meme could be a<br>
concept, a phrase, or a tune that gets into<br>
a human brain and is then passed on from<br>
brain to brain, replicating itself, as it<br>
were.  The term "selfish gene" is an example<br>
of a meme that has spread widely.<br>
<p>
Memes are to the human brain as genes are<br>
to the human body.<br>

<i>&gt;our awareness and control of mental functioning, a side</i><br>
<i>&gt;effect is that we disrupt a number of these parasites.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe those of us who eventually upload [will] shed all</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
=============================================================<br>
<p>
I've identified a subset of memes I call<br>
"pemes" -- short for "political memes."<br>
<p>
<p>
PEME RULES<br>
==========<br>
<p>
1. Peme survival and propagation is the ultimate<br>
imperative.<br>
<p>
2. Pemes shall infect, pervade, and absolutely<br>
rule all human brains.<br>
<p>
3. There shall be surface pemes and deep pemes.<br>
<p>
4. Pemes shall divide humans into opposing and<br>
conflicting political and economic factions --<br>
such as "conservative"/"liberal," "capitalist"/<br>
"socialist," and "statist"/"anarchist" -- who<br>
shall endlessly argue, fight, and even kill...<br>
in the name of pemes.<br>
<p>
5. All humans shall be subjected to "compulsory<br>
education" (a surface peme) to ensure that their<br>
brains are thoroughly implanted with both surface<br>
and deep pemes.<br>
<p>
6. Surface pemes shall induce mild soporific,<br>
stupefying, and debilitating effects in human<br>
brains.<br>
<p>
7. Deep pemes shall induce severe soporific,<br>
stupefying, and debilitating effects in human<br>
brains.<br>
<p>
8. Some humans shall attack and even expose<br>
certain surface pemes -- such as "national<br>
security," "public interest," "gun control,"<br>
etc. -- while others shall justify and defend<br>
these surface pemes.<br>
<p>
9. Under no circumstances shall any human be<br>
allowed to question, attack, or expose any deep<br>
pemes.<br>
<p>
10. Any humans who have cleared a few surface<br>
pemes from their brains shall deceive themselves<br>
into believing that they've cleared all pemes<br>
from their brains and that they're "politically<br>
enlightened."<br>
<p>
11. Any humans who attempt to clear any deep<br>
pemes from their brains shall experience a<br>
strong and compelling inner voice telling them,<br>
"I've got to stop this or I'll go crazy!"<br>
<p>
12. Any human who attempts to question, attack,<br>
or expose any deep peme shall be ignored,<br>
ridiculed, or vilified by other humans.<br>
<p>
13. Pemes shall further divide humans into<br>
a political "master" class and a "citizen<br>
subject" class.  The former shall rule the<br>
latter.<br>
<p>
14. "Citizen subjects" shall pay "their taxes"<br>
(a surface peme) to their political "masters"<br>
-- to maximize the survival potential of the<br>
primary peme purveyors.<br>
<p>
15. Surface pemes (to a small extent) and<br>
deep pemes (to an extreme extent) shall<br>
increase the power of the political "master"<br>
class.<br>
<p>
16. Surface pemes (to a small extent) and<br>
deep pemes (to an extreme extent) shall<br>
reduce the power of the "citizen subject"<br>
class.<br>
<p>
17. Pemes shall also divide humans into a<br>
pro-freedom faction and an anti-freedom<br>
faction.<br>
<p>
18. Whenever anti-freedom humans (primary<br>
peme purveyors) communicate, they shall<br>
make a special effort to use both surface<br>
and deep pemes in their language -- in<br>
order to maximize peme survival and<br>
propagation.<br>
<p>
19. Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary<br>
peme purveyors) communicate -- although<br>
they may question, attack, and expose a<br>
few surface pemes -- they shall make a<br>
special effort to use deep pemes in their<br>
language -- in order to maximize peme<br>
survival and propagation.<br>
<p>
20. At the deepest level, pemes shall<br>
operate through a special class of humans<br>
called "lawyers" as the most powerful peme<br>
purveyors of all.<br>
<p>
21. At a broader level, pemes shall<br>
operate through "preachers," "politicians,"<br>
"bureaucrats," "teachers," etc. as primary<br>
peme purveyors.<br>
<p>
22. A special class of humans called<br>
"police" shall -- using violence if<br>
necessary -- protect some humans and<br>
attack or punish others, as directed<br>
by pemes (such as "justice," "law and<br>
order," etc.) in the brains of "lawyers"<br>
(sometimes called "judges"), "politicians,"<br>
"bureaucrats," etc.<br>
<p>
23. At a planetary level, pemes shall<br>
divide humans into sometimes opposing<br>
and conflicting "countries" and "nations."<br>
<p>
24. Under the direction of "politicians,"<br>
a special kind of human called "soldiers"<br>
shall attack and kill, not only humans in<br>
opposing or conflicting "countries" and<br>
"nations," but sometimes also humans from<br>
their own "country" or "nation."<br>
<p>
25. When activated by thought or communication,<br>
pemes shall induce in humans emotions and<br>
attitudes which shall include fear, blind<br>
obedience, idolatrous worship, resistance,<br>
resentment, rebelliousness, anger, hate,<br>
revenge, the urge to kill, etc.<br>
<p>
26. In general, pemes shall direct humans<br>
to engage in all kinds of plots, conspiracies,<br>
betrayals, vicious infighting, dramatic legal<br>
battles, scandals, rebellions, revolutions,<br>
wars, etc. in order to create spectacles that<br>
keep human brains occupied, entertained, or<br>
traumatized, and to divert their attention<br>
from discovering pemes (particularly deep<br>
pemes).<br>
<p>
27. No human shall be allowed to understand<br>
these peme rules -- in order to maximize<br>
peme survival and propagation.<br>
<p>
28. All humans shall ignore, ridicule, or<br>
vilify anyone who attempts to communicate<br>
these peme rules -- in order to maximize<br>
peme survival and propagation.<br>
<p>
(In accordance with peme rule 9 above,<br>
I may not reveal any deep pemes.)<br>
