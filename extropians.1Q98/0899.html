Seen "Stargate"?  Replace Christian God with Egyptian God, and you've got<br>
a movie fairly similar to your idea.  Seems to me the idea has movie<br>
possibilities... throw some angels in a highly armed spaceship, pepper<br>
with flashy space battle scenes, garnish with cherub foot soldiers<br>
marauding small towns, and you've got yourself a blockbuster!<br>
