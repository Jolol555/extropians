I suspect that the weight of even a tiney "mister fusion" will be more<br>

I've heard that traditional Korean houses are heated by a wood-burning<br>
stove under the house whose chimney is a meandering ceramic pipe buried<br>
in the floor. A high-tech version of this might let you put the burner<br>
outside the tent while still getting nearly all the heat into the tent.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; - Forget about the tent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   And buy the thickest goose-down sleepingbag you can find (mummie).</i><br>
<i>&gt;   1400 gramms of down and a pertex/nylon outershell should keep you</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
As I recall, the problem is to keep the heat in while letting the<br>
moisture out. There are many super-lighe and cheap insulators, but<br>
most also trap moisture. What about using a super lighe insulator<br>
such as bubble-wrap in conjunction with a counter-flow heat exchanger<br>
to let the moisture out?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even better would be a fusion-pile that uses snow/water/air as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; hydrogensource,</i><br>
You don't need an ambient source. you can seal in enough fuel when you<br>
manufacure the thing to meet any reasonable energy demand.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; this could also be used to generate electricity to charge</i><br>
<i>&gt; the battery's of my cell-phone (works very well now in the Alps) and GPS.</i><br>
<p>
Why carry heavy batteries? just run wires to your "mister fusion".<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Would it be (at least theoretically) possible to contain the radiation of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; fusion-reaction inside an object the size of a 2-liter bottle? What kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; material would that take? </i><br>
<p>
I can think of four three approaches, but they all pretty much require<br>
nanotech.<br>
  One approach starts with small amount of hydrogen held at an extremely<br>
high<br>
static pressure and then imploded using lasers or sound waves. The<br>
pressure<br>
is developed at the center of a set of concentric diamondoid shells,<br>
each of which<br>
can likely deliver a megabar of relative pressure differential. The<br>
maximum<br>
pressure that can be applied this way depends on the pressure at which<br>
the<br>
diamondoid loses its tensile strength.<br>
  The other approaches are reduced versions of magnetic-confinement,<br>
inertial confinement, and beam fusion, all of which may be feasible<br>
using nanotech.<br>
