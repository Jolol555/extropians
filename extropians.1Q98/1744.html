apologize for glossing over such an interesting point).<br>

Then, while you're checking the archives for FI<br>
stuff, you might want to glance at my post of Tue, 3<br>
Feb 1998 Re: Creativity and Artificial Intelligence<br>
where I wrote:<br>
&lt; As I noted back in December, there is an essay by<br>
Patricia Churchland called "Feeling Reasons"<br>
available on the Web as part of an ARS Electronica<br>
symposium from September 1997 at<br>
<a href="http://www.aec.at/fleshfactor/subs/reasons.html">http://www.aec.at/fleshfactor/subs/reasons.html</a> which<br>
explains why autonomous reasoning requires an<br>
'affect' or 'feeling' system in order to function<br>
properly. &gt;<br>
<p>
Much of her essay is based on the neuroscience work<br>
of Antonio Damasio.<br>
