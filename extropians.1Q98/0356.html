'Mr. Fusion' as in 'Back to the Future'? Not with hot fusion (while the<br>
cold one being still mythical). Reactor volume way too small (even JET is<br>
too small).  Perfect diamondoids (which are as susceptible to rad ageing<br>
as everything else) are no Unobtainium. <br>

<p>
Yes. But massive energy release and waste isotope release are combined in<br>
a catastrophic failure. To prevent catastrophic failure you must operate a<br>
a sensor-permeated system way out the critical regime, scrapping, and<br>
rebuilding it when it grows brittle enough.  Continous autorepair is<br>
impossible due to high fluxes (thermal, rad) in a small volume. At these<br>
hellish conditions your nanoagents will drop as flies, faster than you<br>
could remake them. (As a side note, design of radresistant nanosystems is<br>
an absolute prerequisite for the really fast interstellar probes, both<br>
because of the relativistic interstellar medium rad load and due to the<br>
nuclear propulsion and/or energy source emissions.  (Then there is laser<br>
propulsion, and Forrester's nanoprobe catapults)). <br>
<p>
As I already said, you can quantitatively reclaim nuclear ashes. Question<br>
is, can you safely exclude catastrophic failure of the reactor device? Not<br>
convinced. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; build tiny reactors, the massive energy release goes away: your "mister</i><br>
<i>&gt; fusion" is more like your gas tank than like a supertanker or an oil</i><br>
<i>&gt; refinery in this regard. If, as you say, nanotech can permit complete</i><br>
<p>
The smaller the reactor, the more critical the operation regime. The<br>
enrichened uranium high-flux research reactor currently being erected in<br>
Munich, Garching has a core the size of a wastebasket. Its energy density,<br>
and large surface of the cooling vents at a record neutron flux do not<br>
seem to make for a passively safe system. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; recovery of the dangerous isotopes generated by neutron activation, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; all that remains is deactivation of those same isotopes. This is also</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfectly feasible, because these isotopes can be exposed to still more</i><br>

<p>
This is a feature I also do not like about planned fusion tritium<br>
breeders. Though power density of a hypothetical production tokamak will<br>
be relatively low, the wall radiation load will be quite demanding. We<br>
have already miles and miles of tritium-contaminated liquid lithium pipes,<br>
now we must also intertwine them with hot waste ducts. I do not see how<br>
this will limit the total waste curie output.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; atoms will eventually transform to stable isotopes under additional</i><br>
<i>&gt; exposure to fast neutrons. The tiny percentage that do not can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; separated (again by nanotech) and deactivated in a tiny particle</i><br>
<p>
Not by nanotech. It just makes conventional isotope separation cheaper,<br>
and increases the yield. It is difficult to see how dirt cheap but precise<br>
macroscopic structures could make such a big difference. <br>

<p>
Why tiny? I do not see how nanotech can decrease the accelerator size<br>
significantly. Novel acceleration principles do not rely on nanotech for<br>
implementation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; entire process of deactivation should yield a substantial net gain in</i><br>
<i>&gt; useable thermal energy. All of this hold true even if your reactor must</i><br>
<i>&gt; use D-D or D-T, both of which produce a lot of primary fast neutrons and</i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore a relatively large amount of isotopic transformation. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Remember that nanotech is likely to permit the use of diamondiod</i><br>
<i>&gt; structural components instead of steel, so the reactor will be</i><br>

<p>
Do diamond vacuum chamber walls age gracefully under high<br>
thermal/radiation load? I think not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; isotopes will be fairly benign. Now, if nanotech permits us to use the</i><br>
<i>&gt; H-H reaction instead of D-D, we won't have much of a problem to solve,</i><br>
<p>
I don't see how a chemical-energy-level technology could significantly<br>
assist nuclear reactions, besides increasing cheapness of construction,<br>
enhanced supervision and waste recycling yield.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; because there are no fast neutrons generated in the primary reaction. </i><br>
