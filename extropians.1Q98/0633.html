<i>&gt; : Who sells the weapons? The government? Who earns money when a war has</i><br>
<i>&gt; : started? The government?</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Not money: power.  The state always expands during wartime,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and rarely if ever retreats afterward to its former size.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ("War is the health of the state.")</i><br>
<p>
The state spends a lot of money during wartime, money extracted from its<br>
population through taxes. It spends this money in buying weapons, paying<br>
transports etc. So the state does not get more powerful, those who are paid by<br>
the state do. And in effect, those who *own* these companies are the ones who<br>
earn from war. That's the big investment banks. Example: First National Bank<br>
during the Vietnam War. Right after this bank had allowed Textron to buy the<br>
Bell Helicopter Company, the extensive use of helicopters in the war started.<br>
[Prouty, L. Fletcher: "JFK - The CIA, Vietnam and the Plot to Assassinate John<br>
F. Kennedy", NY 1996]. First National Bank also participated in Boeing, which<br>
had dramatic increases of sales (1965: $ 2 billion, 68: $ 3.3 billion, 70: $<br>
3.7 billion). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To blame "Businessmen" for wars, you must ignore the fact that MOST</i><br>
<i>&gt; of them, on either side, LOSE money in wartime.</i><br>
<p>
I don't ignore it, it's true. But the really big enterprises, of course<br>
especially arms industry, usually profit from war -- and the big banks behind<br>
them do as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : Who profits from a tax policy which burdens the majority and favours</i><br>
<i>&gt; : the minority? The minority, of course. Which is not the government.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hah!  Government is the most favored minority of all!</i><br>
<p>
In which way?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : John Clark, one of the more intelligent free market advisors, would</i><br>
<i>&gt; : answer: "If you remove governments, all this corruption will disappear</i><br>
<i>&gt; : and the free market will bring up only efficient companies." The problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; : is that by removing government, you only remove a cover under which the</i><br>
<i>&gt; : true power elite hides. The power structures remain - and before you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; : say "Jebediah", your country will be ruled directly by big enterprises.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Evidence?</i><br>
<p>
For the power structures, there's lots of evidence. US history is full of it.<br>
Start with JFK, go over to Vietnam, look at Watergate, look at how Reagan was<br>
put up as a strawman for Bush and how Bush (former CIA-boss, coming from a<br>
rich family, good connections to investment banks, big in the oil industry<br>
with Zapata Oil), how Bush started the Gulf War etc. <br>
<p>
For what happens after you remove the cover: The fact that nothing you call a<br>
free market has ever existed. And the above facts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you're right, wouldn't it be better in some ways to have the beast</i><br>
<i>&gt; made naked, so all can see its true nature?</i><br>
<p>
Your rhetoric doesn't help here. Major parts of the population are controlled<br>
through mass media, unless anyone shows them a "beast" on TV, they won't<br>
believe in it. People in the Middle Ages (another fine Free Market) followed<br>
the church. This is an example of direct influence through a true power elite<br>
and of what people do in this case.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : Luddism is a perfectly understandable reaction in capitalism. Because in</i><br>
<i>&gt; : a capitalist society, progress in production efficiency will often hurt</i><br>
<i>&gt; : the population. The more efficient you are, the less workers you need.</i><br>
<i>&gt; : More unemployment. 4,5 million registered in Germany today, and rising.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So why did employment in the Nottingham textile industry (origin of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; term "Luddite") increase with mechanization?</i><br>
<p>
Short-term development because of cheaper and better goods and still high<br>
demands (sometimes the market laws indeed apply). Working conditions, however,<br>
worsened dramatically. That's why the Luddite movement was started - not<br>
because people were just technophobic, but because they suddenly had to do<br>
more work for less money and/or work under extreme conditions. The Luddites<br>
never attacked humans in the beginning. Still, the industrial Horsfell ordered<br>
to shoot a group of Luddites. Horsfell was murdered, and maybe it was not the<br>
Luddites who did it but the industry who now had a justification for a true<br>
witchhunt. First, the destruction of machines was punished with death, later<br>
with deportation. <br>
What's better, getting roasted by a gov for killing a kid or getting hanged<br>
for destroying a machine?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course there are no state regulatory barriers to employment,</i><br>
<i>&gt; only reactionary "libertarians" believe that, right?</i><br>
<p>
Right. German industry complained about the oh-so-high loan costs from<br>
1995-1996 and promised to create jobs when they would not have to pay so much.<br>
Further cuts in the social system were made. Now German industry complains<br>
about the oh-so-high loan costs again. Further cuts in the social system are<br>
made. Then ... Get the idea? And all the time, unemployment has not decreased<br>
a bit, instead it has risen. And neither in 1995 nor in 1999 the German<br>
industry was in a bad situation. Fact is, each year they make record profits.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : About military: Why do you think we have it? Because some bums in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; : government think we need it to defend our country?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Because military forces have been around longer than anyone can remember,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and few dare question their necessity?  I dunno, you tell us.</i><br>
<p>
No, I won't. Give me a rational explanation. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : Most extropians despise governments, but at the same time, they are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; : perfect democrats. Because they really believe that democracy works the</i><br>
<i>&gt; : way it is intended to work - they just think that this way is not right.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well, let's have a show of hands.  How many here believe there's no fraud</i><br>
<i>&gt; in democracy as it is, in your respective city or country?</i><br>
<p>
No, how many believe, that elections are not manipulated, that people choose<br>
politicians freely and that the politics are just wrong?<br>
