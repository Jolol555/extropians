<i>          &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>          &gt;&gt;Polarization is digital.                   </i><br>
          <br>
<i>          &gt;Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;         </i><br>
<i>          &gt;Do we have to go over this again? </i><br>
         <br>
looks like it.<br>
                    <br>
<i>        &gt;If this were so, John, when you put a polarization filter at a 1         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;deg. angle to a vertically polarized light source, you would get no         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;light through it. Since you don't then this isn't so. </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
But it is so, sometimes you get no light because the photon doesn't get  <br>
through the filter, in this case there is only a 1 degree angle difference so <br>
it will probably pass through completely unharmed, but there is a .0346%   <br>
probability the filter will stop the photon because  SIN^2(1) =.000346.  <br>
<p>
Regardless of how you set your polarization filter you will find that any <br>
photon will always be at the exact same angle you set the filter and pass <br>
through totally undiminished, OR it will be polarized at right angles to it <br>
and be stopped entirely, there is no middle ground.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Polarization is an x/y polar vector combination </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You're talking about classical electromagnetic theory and useful <br>
approximations when dealing with large numbers of photons like those in a <br>
beam of light, I'm talking about Quantum mechanics and what actually happens <br>
when a photon encounters a polarization filter.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;you are going to get the square root of -1 in there somewhere, which         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;is hardly binary.         </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
Then how is it possible that computer programs like Mathematica have <br>
absolutely no trouble in dealing with the square root of -1, and just about <br>
any other mathematical concept you care to name?        <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If it weren't, and what you said was true, then we'd be able to tell         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;by the polarization of light which way was absolutely up in the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;universe.         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not so because as I said, you will always find a photon to be in one of two <br>
states. You can make "up" be any direction you want because a photon will be  <br>
polarized in exactly the same direction you set your filter or exactly 90  <br>
degrees from it and it makes not the slightest difference what direction you  <br>
pick.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, in 1957 it was found that there is an objective difference <br>
between right and left, the law of conservation of parity is violated in weak <br>
nuclear reactions.              <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;That being said, when people refer to the digital vs. analog        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;dicho tomy, they really mean binary vs. analog.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
If you're saying that a deep idea can not be communicated digitally unless <br>
the base number used is large, I remind you that you just communicated that <br>
idea over a line that has the smallest possible base, 2.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;When people think 'digital' they mean that they are thinking in         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;terms of b&amp;w, on/off, flip/flop, rather than the many shades of grey         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that most people prefer to  muddy their thinking with. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Shakespeare is not noted for having a lot of shallow black and white  <br>
characters in his plays, yet every day his works are sent over digital wires,  <br>
the genetic code of living creatures too.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This is why Mr. Jones objects to seeing AI's as 'human'since they         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;will be much more logical and straightforward than humans, and will         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;not be prone to the grey muddy thinking that he sees as the hallmark         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of 'human' intelligence.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Unfortunately humans don't have a monopoly on muddy thinking, I tried one of <br>
the new translation programs the other day, I translated the sentence <br>
"Jay Edgar Hoover was the director of the FBI" into German and then back into <br>
English, it came back as "Jay Edgar vacuum cleaner was the director of the <br>
FBI".<br>
