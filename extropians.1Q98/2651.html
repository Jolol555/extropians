<i>&gt;Its sad indeed to see neo-neo-luddites on an extropian mail list who think</i><br>
<i>&gt;that '7-bit ascii should be enough for anybody'.  I think that using HTML</i><br>
as<br>
<i>&gt;an email standard is an excellent step up in the quality of communication.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Here's words for warning to this reactionary attitude: "Why would anyone</i><br>
ever<br>
<i>&gt;need more than 640k of RAM?", so sayeth Chairman Bill Gates, in 1981.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As one of the most technophilic mail lists on the net, we should be</i><br>
<i>&gt;encouraging the use of as high a quality communications medium as possible,</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt;push the standards forward.</i><br>

Good old Mike, still jumping on every train that has the words 'NEW' on it,<br>
no matter which direction it heads.<br>
<p>
HTML postings allow me to<br>
<p>
    - determine whether you have read a message by me or not, including<br>
information about your browser and operating system,<br>
    - execute malign JavaScript code on your machine and exploit documented<br>
bugs in the language which have not yet been fixed in all its<br>
implementations, and especially the mailing programs are a bit slow in<br>
reacting to such issues,<br>
    - give mails which would have no content otherwise a cool look to make<br>
them more important. The CAPS LOCK key for the lamers, so to speak.<br>
<p>
I dunno whether M$ supports ActiveX in messages, but if they do, that's<br>
another point.<br>
<p>
Who needs more than 7-bit to exchange content? The only drawback is German<br>
umlauts and other special characters, which I would have executed once and<br>
for all about 20 years ago anyway. Unicode may offer some new possibilities<br>
here, but HTML for a mailing list is really unnecessary. Did it ever occur<br>
to you that there might still be some people using PINE or stuff like that?<br>
