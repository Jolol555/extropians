<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Aging is caused by this errors and the ones mentioned ahead.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Sounds unlikely, but what is the evidence for your theory?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My first evidence is that our ancestrals did not age (bacteria don't age</i><br>
<i>&gt;and most of the non-aging species are quite primitive in an evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt;scale).</i><br>
<p>
OK.  I'd have to agree given what I know.  Of course, bacteria do age in a<br>
sense, but their generations are so quick that the issue is one of semantics.<br>
I.e., they do not age as we do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If aging "evolved", it can be caused by two types of errors: (1)</i><br>
<i>&gt;old processes that started to fail; or (2) new processes that are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;perfect yet.</i><br>
<p>
The second implies a telos, which is okay by me, but should be pointed out<br>
nonetheless.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;About the evolution of aging species towards non-aging species, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;question might be asked of weather these species suppressed aging or</i><br>
<i>&gt;their evolutionary "relatives" in more hazardous positions evolved</i><br>
<i>&gt;aging?</i><br>
<p>
Good way of framing it.  It's the polar bear question all over.  (Are polar<br>
bears descended from a white bearlike ancestor or a nonwhite one?<br>
Most would assume the latter, though without any evidence, either might<br>
be the case.  The case comes from _Phylogeny, Ecology, and Behavior_<br>
by Daniel R. Brooks and Deborah A McLennan (1991).)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think it can go either way, the best evidence I have supporting</i><br>
<i>&gt;the first option is that there is some evolutionary pressure against</i><br>
<i>&gt;aging in species who live non-hazardous lives. For example, in mammals,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the species with the longest life span (ours), is the one with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;longest maturation time, something that can only be achieved by being on</i><br>
<i>&gt;top of the food chain.</i><br>
<p>
In some cases, you might be right.  I'm not sure about the human one<br>
having to do with ecological niche.  Even so, there does seem to be<br>
some evidence that developmental times are sensitive to environ-<br>
mental (boundary) conditions.  I read a few years ago of a comparative<br>
studies of possums in the Carolinas.  They found that the ones that<br>
live on the coastal islands developed more slowly than the ones that<br>
lived on the mainland.  The reason seemed to be that they were less<br>
likely to be run over by a car on the islands.:)  (The differences were<br>
in years -- I believe a one versus a three year developmental cycle.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyway, the best is to read my article about the evolution of aging.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's a long and boring (yes, very boring, I intend to change that soon</i><br>
<i>&gt;by making it smaller) article, the URL (after saying it is boring you</i><br>
<i>&gt;probably won't be interested but...) is:</i><br>
<i>&gt;<a href="http://homepage.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/science/why.htm">http://homepage.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/science/why.htm</a></i><br>
<p>
I'll take a look.<br>
