So here's the BIG question:<br>
<p>
1) What is the difference between science and art anyway?<br>
<p>
<p>
Hmm, interesting question. The line between art and science can blur<br>
depending on how you look at the two. I would say that they interleave to<br>
some degree but if your considering fine-art, then the goal is a good<br>
place to start. The goal of a fine artist is a personal expression or<br>
ideas based on personal experience with the human emotion. Science is a<br>
fact based, investigative study.<br>
<p>
Hmm, perhaps this is best answered by one of the More's..<br>
