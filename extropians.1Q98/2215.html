OK, I should have watched the whole thing, my mistake.  The first two<br>
hours seemed to play out the technophobia themes that are so common in<br>
TV and movies.  I get upset with plots that promote the sense that the<br>
average individual is being suffocated by computers and technology.  The<br>
elevator and escalator scene for example.  The idea that computers/AI<br>
can and will reach out and destroy any decent person's life, and there<br>
is no escape!  I know that wasn't the point of the movie, but that is<br>
what turned me off.  <br>

Well I can't speak for the last hour, but from what I watched, the<br>
general public was left with idea that cryonics is a joke because,<br>
<p>
1. the cryonics company will go broke and you will end up a rotting<br>
corpse in some warehouse, which was displayed very graphically in the<br>
movie<br>
2. your family will go to court and have you planted anyway  <br>
3. the cryonics company will readily hand over your frozen head to some<br>
one unqualified to maintain the suspension equipment<br>
4. the equipment will break down and you will end up in a basement<br>
freezer next to the ice cream and frozen fish, or worst yet, out on the<br>
street<br>
<p>
For Extropians, these aspects of the movie are silly and we ignore<br>
them.  But how will the general public view this?<br>
