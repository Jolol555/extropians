Not that I disagree with your other overall points, Michael. But a lot of<br>
your specifics are in error...<br>

Untrue. Most of the universities that are part of the Internet were<br>
not part of the original ARPANet project. Neither are the many thousands<br>
of privately-owned servers that still make up a large minority of<br>
internet sites. Corporate (ie commercial) sites have a higher<br>
profile, but are have not been as intergral as the aforementioned<br>
parties. Most new hosts are still placed on the Net via academia.<br>

Although this may too often end up being the case, it is not what<br>
law enforcement officials would claim. Real mileage may vary, but<br>
their stated aims almost always include crime *prevention*. They<br>
spend a lot of time (and money) talking/training/etc about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;New Hampshire, which has open borders with three other US states</i><br>
<i>&gt;(one of which has one of the highest crime rates in the US, btw)</i><br>
<p>
I love New Hampshire, but if New Hampshirites have a failing, it's<br>
that they love to slam the Commonwealth, usually for the wrong<br>
reasons. The 1995 census says that MA is ranked 15th in violent<br>
crime. One third of the way down hardly qualifies as "one of the<br>
highest". In fact MA's *rate* is almost exactly the National average<br>
(685 per 100K). And MA's rate is dropping faster than NH's (which<br>
admittedly, doesn't have as far to go).<br>

tschau,<br>
