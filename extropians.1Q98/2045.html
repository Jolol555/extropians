	Abstract:<br>
<p>
	By proving (a) that the nature of the identity<br>
	of the number one is binary and as such is com-<br>
	posed of two symmetrical attributes the sum of<br>
	which equals zero, (b) that all numbers derive<br>
	their primary identity by relation to zero, (c)<br>
	that all non-zero numbers are subsets of zero,<br>
	and (d) that the source and the sum of all num-<br>
	bers and of all difference between all numbers<br>
	is zero, it is proven that zero is the supreme<br>
	number, the Alpha and Omega, and the universal<br>
	constant from which there can be no deviation.<br>
	Zero-sum law expresses universal equilibrium.<br>

	    YOU CAN NOT GET SOMETHING FROM NOTHING<br>
<p>
<p>
	    (-)--  THE ZERO-SUM OF IDENTITY  --(+)<br>
<p>
	The primary identity relation forming the basis<br>
	of all mathematics is the  relation  of 0 and 1.<br>
	The number 1 is the symbolic arising of identity<br>
	establishing the foundation of difference, rela-<br>
	tion, and identity. To understand logic and the<br>
	truth we must first understand the 0,1 relation.<br>
<p>
	If there was no difference between 0 and 1, then<br>
	there would be no number 1, thus it follows that<br>
	the identity 1 is the difference between 0 and 1<br>
	and the difference between 0 and 1 is what 1 is.<br>
	The difference between 0 and 1 is  symmetrical ,<br>
	and thus 1 is 1 more (+1) than 0 and 0 is 1 less<br>
	(-1) than 1. Here's that symmetrical difference:<br>
<p>
	         The Difference That Is One<br>
<p>
	                 0---&gt;1 = +1<br>
	                 0&lt;---1 = -1<br>
	                 0&lt;--&gt;1 =  0<br>
<p>
	      1 is 1 from 0 and 0 is -1 from 1<br>
	         The difference that is one<br>
	              is zero in total<br>
<p>
	The double arrows express the whole 0,1 relation.<br>
	As we can see, the difference between 0 and 1 is <br>
	symmetrical, and therefore, as the identity of 1 <br>
	IS this difference, the number 1 is  symmetrical.<br>
	The difference that is 1 is not more +1 than -1, <br>
	it is equally both, and is therefore symmetrical.<br>
	We may also prove the 0,1 symmetry as follows:<br>
<p>
	          The Identity Matrix Shows<br>
	        The Difference Between 0 and 1<br>
	        (found at their intersections)<br>
<p>
	                     0  1<br>
	                    ______<br>
	                 0 | 0 +1 |<br>
<i>	                   |      | = 0</i><br>
	                 1 |-1  0 |<br>
	                   --------<br>
<p>
	             0 is -1 relative to 1<br>
	             1 is +1 relative to 0<br>
<p>
	As the difference between 0 and 1 is symmetrical,<br>
	the 0,1 relation simultaneously defines + and -1.<br>
	The identity of 1 is this symmetrical difference.<br>
	Proving that 1 is the  symmetrical relation of 1 <br>
	to 0 is the fact that in the identity matrix the <br>
	intersection of 1 and 1 is 0 (and when  the iden-<br>
	tity matrix is expressed as logic functions, the<br>
	relation of 1 to 1 yields a null function), this <br>
	proves that 1 derives no identity attribute from <br>
	the relation of 1 to 1.  The number 1 exists ex- <br>
	clusively within the 0,1 relation, and therefore<br>
	is nothing but that entire symmetrical relation.<br>
<p>
	The number 1 is, like a coin that has two sides,<br>
	a binary entity that is composed of equal yet op-<br>
	posite components (1,-1) the sum of which equals <br>
	that from which 1 arises,  which is 0. This para-<br>
	dox may be referred to as the "nonarising of 1." <br>
	As 1 cannot escape 0, the number 0 is absolute.<br>
<p>
	 YOU CANNOT GET SOMETHING (1) FROM NOTHING (0)<br>
<p>
	        0 = (...-1 &lt;--&gt;0&lt;--&gt; +1...) = 0<br>
<p>
	The number 0 gives us 1 and takes it away. Where<br>
	"1" is something and "0" is nothing, we can say,<br>
	in light of the nonarising of 1, that you cannot<br>
	get something (1) from nothing (0). So identity,<br>
	like energy, is conserved -- and as we will see,<br>
	this conservation law is the universal constant.<br>

	THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE WHOLE TRUTH<br>
<p>
<p>
	    (-)--  THE HOLISTIC NUMBER ONE  --(+)<br>
                                             -  +<br>
	If the identity of 1 is symmetrical (0&lt;--&gt;1) yet<br>
	our notation of 1 implies only an asymmetry that<br>
	expresses either +1 or -1 but not both, then our<br>
	notation of 1 expresses only  half of the actual<br>
	and  true nature of the difference that is 1. If<br>
	half of the truth works for us, that's fine, but<br>
	should we decide to express only the whole truth<br>
	and noting but the whole truth, then logic dic-<br>
	tates that we must express BOTH of the sides of<br>
	the symmetrical coin that is the identity of 1.<br>
<p>
	          1 = (difference) = (+)+(-)<br>
<p>
	So the notation that  expresses the whole truth<br>
	about the number 1 will express the symmetrical<br>
	1,-1 structure of the difference-derived iden-<br>
	tity of 1. Let that notation simply be "1h."<br>
<p>
	                 0---&gt;1 = +1<br>
	                 0&lt;---1 = -1<br>
	                 0&lt;--&gt;1 = 1h<br>
<p>
	             1h = (1 + (-1)) = 0<br>
<p>
	+1 expresses 50% of the symmetrical difference<br>
	that is 1, and -1 expresses the other 50%, but<br>
	only 1h expresses 100% of the  difference that <br>
	is 1. Expressing the  Whole Truth about the na-<br>
	ture of identity requires that the 1h notation<br>
	replace all instances where "1" and "-1" are <br>
	denoted. Here is such a uniform conversion:<br>
<p>
	 Conversion Of Half Truths To Full Truth<br>
	 Via Uniform Holistic Number 1h Conversion<br>
<p>
	 HALF Truth:  1 * 2 + 1 = 3  <br>
	 convert to 1s<br>
	 HALF Truth:  1 * (1+1) + 1 = (1+1+1)<br>
<p>
	 convert all 1s to 1h and sum to 100% truth<br>
<p>
	 FULL Truth:  1h * (1h+1h) + 1h = (1h+1h+1h)<br>
	 100% Truth:  0 * 0 + 0 = 0<br>
<p>
	Notice that because 1h = (1+(-1)) and because the <br>
	definition of 1h logically (and as such properly) <br>
	defines every instance of the numbers "1" and "-1"<br>
	to be expressions of the whole difference that is <br>
	the implicit identity structure of each and every <br>
	instance of the number 1 and -1, it follows there-<br>
	fore that by definition, the number 1h implies an <br>
	infinite series of conversions of each 1 and each <br>
	-1 to 1h within the 1h statement itself. Thus the<br>
	holistic number "1h" defines the existence of an<br>
	infinite series of self-similar entities within<br>
	itself. The holistic number 1h expresses a spon-<br>
	taneous universe. 1h defines an entity that is<br>
	simultaneously all of 0, 1, -1, and infinity:<br>
<p>
	 Infinite Series Of Definition-Dictated<br>
	 Replacements Of The 1 and -1 Within 1h<br>
<p>
	 where ( =&gt; ) = (implies)<br>
<p>
	 IF +1 =&gt; 1h, and<br>
	 IF -1 =&gt; 1h, and<br>
	 IF 1h = (1+(-1))<br>
	 THEN (1+(-1) =&gt; ((1+(-1))+(1+(-1))) =&gt;<br>
	 (((1+(-1))+(1+(-1)))+((1+(-1))+(1+(-1))))<br>
	 unto Infinity....<br>
<p>
	 ERGO: 1h &lt;=&gt; 2h &lt;=&gt; 4h &lt;=&gt; infinity(h) = 0<br>
<p>
	The infinity of the universe arises only because<br>
	something can come from nothing IF it = (1+(-1)),<br>
	which shall be proven by universal conservation.<br>

	Expressing the holistic structure of the number 1 <br>
	while describing his multiverse theory (which pos-<br>
	tulates a multitude of universes emerging from no-<br>
	thing), the theoretical physicist Dr. Michio Kaku <br>
	states in the May '96 issue of Astronomy magazine:<br>
<p>
	    "Creating universes out of nothing may <br>
	    seen to violate cherished conservation <br>
	    principles, until we realize that it <br>
	    takes no energy to create a universe.  <br>
	    If the universe is closed like a bubble,<br>
	    then the energy content of its matter <br>
	    is positive, while the energy of its <br>
	    gravity is negative. THE SUM IS EXACTLY <br>
	    ZERO (because it requires positive en-<br>
	    ergy to lift an object out of its grav-<br>
	    itational well, the object's gravita-<br>
	    tional energy is negative). Thus it <br>
	    takes NO NET energy to create new bub-<br>
	    bles, which are constantly being creat-<br>
	    ed in the sea of nothing. Universes <br>
	    are for free." [1] [ emphasis added ]<br>
<p>
	We can express the zero-sum of a universe, and<br>
	in so doing express the nature of 1h, as such:<br>
<p>
	             Pre-Universe = 0 <br>
	            Universe = (1+(-1))<br>
<p>
	               Pre-U = U = 0<br>
<p>
	In harmony with Kaku's multiverse theory, the<br>
	holistic number 1h simultaneously describes the<br>
	zero sum of each universe in the multiverse and<br>
	of each  entity found in every single universe.<br>
	The holistic number 1h defines  everything for<br>
	every universe is the  infinite series  of 1h;<br>
	a self-similar fractalized infinity that = 0.<br>

	 (-)-- RESOLUTION OF ALL NUMBERS TO ZERO --(+)<br>
<p>
	None of the many varieties of numbers, such as <br>
	rational,  irrational,  imaginary, complex, ect,<br>
	constitute a deviation from the zero-sum law and<br>
	the  conservation of identity simply because all<br>
	number varieties are  founded  upon the primary<br>
	unit that is the identity 1, even the fractional<br>
	numbers, for the number 1 itself can be thought<br>
	of as a 1/10 (.1) fraction of the number 10. <br>
<p>
	Imaginary numbers are based upon the square root<br>
	of -1, an operation that might be said to exceed<br>
	the one-to-one relational  symmetry of 0,1. That<br>
	proposition fails, however, because the holistic<br>
	number 1h  logically  replace all instances of 1<br>
	and -1 due to the symmetrical nature of 1 and -1,<br>
	and the square root of 1h is 0. Yet this doesn't<br>
	mean we cannot construct a system of imaginary <br>
	numbers, for it is simply a useful invention.<br>
<p>
	If we express the system of real and imaginary<br>
	numbers using the Argand diagram which displays<br>
	the real numbers along the x axis and the imagi-<br>
	nary numbers along the  y axis of a  Cartesian<br>
	coordinate system, we can see the symmetrical<br>
	relations of 1 and 1i (imaginary 1) to 0:<br>

<p>
	A complex number (which is a number containing<br>
	one real and one imaginary number) contains the<br>
	symmetrical relation of each of those numbers to<br>
	0 (as we can see above), and thus the sum of all<br>
	complex numbers will equal zero. So to sum this <br>
	up to the conclusion: logical dictates that no <br>
	number-type or expression can deviate from 0<br>
<p>
	because...<br>
<p>
	(a) all numbers are naught but multiples of the <br>
	numbers 1 or -1 or of the fractions .1 or .-1, <br>
<p>
	(b) the entire nature of the identity-superstruc-<br>
	ture of each one of the numbers 1, -1, .1 and .-1 <br>
	is expressed logically as a numeric symmetry that <br>
	contains both (1 and -1) or both (.1 and .-1), <br>
<p>
	(c) that symmetrical-identity structure equals 0,<br>
<p>
	it follows that...<br>
<p>
	(d) the sum of the identity of all numbers must <br>
	equal 0. (Heretofore, the  real numbers  are to <br>
	be representative of all varieties of numbers.)<br>

	Every number attains its primary identity attri-<br>

	entity attribute of 4 is 4), by relation to the<br>
	number 0. Yet 0 is the only number that attains<br>
	its primary attribute by relation to itself and<br>
	thus is the only absolute number. 0 is not only<br>
	the source but the  sum of all numbers  and the<br>
	sum of all  identity attributes  of all numbers.<br>
	These facts, which shall be proven below, prove<br>
	that all numbers are subordinate subsets of 0.<br>

	By relation to 0, number 1 attains its primary <br>
	identity attribute, which is 1, yet 0 attains a <br>
	secondary identity attribute -1 by relation to 1.<br>
	0 attains its primary attribute of 0 from itself.<br>
	This means that 0 can precede the existence of 1,<br>
	and thus 0 is an absolute, not relative, identity.<br>
<p>
	0 = that which attains its identity from itself.<br>
	And the identity attribute all numbers attain by<br>
	relation to themselves (as the matrix shows) is 0.<br>
	Because 0 attains its identity from 0, and both 1 <br>
	and -1 attain their identities from relation to 0,<br>
	it follows that all identities are derived from a <br>
	symmetrical relation to 0, and thus: (a) 0 is the <br>
	source of all identities and (b) zero is the end<br>
	sum of all identities = Alpha &amp; Omega. Proof:<br>

	All numbers listed vertically below a number along <br>
	the top are the identity attributes of that number <br>
	as derived from its relation to the numbers listed <br>
	along the side, outside the matrix box.  So number<br>
	-2 is an identity of the number 4 because number 4 <br>
	is 2 less than number 6. In the same way, -2 is an<br>
	identity attribute Mr. Jones if and only if Jones <br>
	is 2 feet shorter than Mr. Smith or anything.<br>
<p>
	As the identity matrices above clearly show us, the <br>
	primary identity attribute of each number, which is <br>
	itself, is derived from its relation to 0, and thus <br>
	0 is the source of all numeric identities, which is <br>
	also expressed by the fact that 0 is the beginning: <br>

	               &lt;-------|--------&gt;<br>
<p>
	As we can also see, all the numbers listed in the<br>
	matrices, and by  extension all numbers, are iden-<br>
	tity attributes of 0, and thus 0 contains all num-<br>
	bers as attributes.  We can conclude that all num-<br>
	bers are subsets of the absolute number 0 because:<br>
<p>
	 (a) 0 precedes all other numbers,<br>
	 (b) 0 is the only absolute number,<br>
	 (c) 0 is the source of all numbers,<br>
	 (d) 0 is the sum of all numbers, and<br>
	 (e) 0 is the sum of all identity attributes.<br>

	It follows thus that 0 contains all numbers and <br>
	thus all numbers are subsets of 0 and 0 is thus <br>
	the superset that contains all numbers. The set<br>
	of all numbers is 0:<br>
<p>
	         0 = {1,-1,2,-2,3,-3...} = 0<br>
<p>
	       0 = {the set of all numbers} = 0<br>
<p>
<p>
	              - &lt;-----0-----&gt; +<br>
<p>
	In addition to the algebraic proof that the dif-<br>
	ference between any two numbers equals 0, we can<br>
	also prove the same by the rules of set theory.<br>
<p>
	The definition of "difference between two sets"<br>
	is: the difference of sets A and B is the set of<br>
	elements which belong to A but don't belong to B.<br>
	[2]  The definition of an "identity set" is: the <br>
	identity set of A is  the set that  contains all <br>
	the attributes of the identity of A. An example:<br>
	-2 would be a member of the  identity set of Mr.<br>
	Jones if Jones is 2 feet shorter than Mr. Smith,<br>
	and also of the number 4 if 4 is 2 less than 6.<br>
<p>
	To determine if two numbers, for example 1 and 4,<br>
	are different we must identify all the members of<br>
	the identity set of 1 that are not members of the<br>
	identity set of 4.  Because every number contains<br>
	every other number as an  identity attribute as a<br>
	consequence of its relation to every other number<br>
	(as the identity matrix proves), the identity set<br>
	of every number is equivalent to the identity set<br>
	of every other number. For example, where "--" <br>
	expresses the set notation for "difference":<br>
<p>
	    The Identity Sets Of Numbers 1 and 4<br>
<p>
	    1 = {0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,4,-4,5,-5...}<br>
	    4 = {0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,4,-4,5,-5...}<br>
<p>
	    ERGO: 1 -- 4 = null<br>
<p>
	So logic dictates that there is no difference bet-<br>
	ween the numbers 1 and 4. This is consistent with<br>
	the zero-sum of their difference, in which 1 is 3<br>
	less (-3) than 4 and 4 is 3 more (+3) than 1. How<br>
	can this be? Obviously 4 is somehow unique from 1.<br>
<p>
	The difference between 1 and 4 is simply a product<br>
	of their sequential location, 4 comes after 1 and,<br>
	as an example, 1 attains its identity attribute of<br>
	-2 from 3  but 4 attains its identity attribute of<br>
	-2 from 6. These differences do not, however, con-<br>
	stitue any deviation from zero-sum law, since all<br>
	components of these differences are symmetrical. <br>

	(-)-- ZERO: THE UNIVERSAL PHYSICAL CONSTANT --(+)<br>
<p>
<p>
	The Law Of Space-Time-Motion Conservation:<br>
<p>
	Every unit of forward (+) space-time-motion corre-<br>
	sponds to a symmetrical unit of backward (-) space-<br>
	time-motion such that net space-time-motion always <br>
	equals zero.<br>
<p>
	Just as the numeric unit 1 contains both +1 and -1<br>
	a unit of space-time-motion contains both +1 and -1.<br>
<p>
	          Logical &amp; Physical Symmetry<br>
<p>
	                  0---&gt;1 = +1<br>
	                  0&lt;---1 = -1<br>
	                  0&lt;--&gt;1 =  0<br>
<p>
	How is this physical symmetry so?  The relativity<br>
	of space-time motion. If object X moves forward 1<br>
	unit of space --&gt; relative to a coordinate system,<br>
	it is also and simultaneously true that the coor-<br>
	dinate system moves backward &lt;-- -1 unit of space<br>
	relative to X. The sum of the net motion equals 0.<br>
	Since we  measure space by motion  across it, all<br>
	our measurements (when  all aspects of the motion<br>
	are summed) must equal 0. For a more comprehensive<br>
	review: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/0-space.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/0-space.htm</a> <br>
<p>
	      net space-motion = (--&gt; + &lt;--) = 0<br>
	      net space-motion = ( 1  +(-1)) = 0<br>
<p>
	The very same symmetry holds for time motion. Our<br>
	motion forward in time is forward motion --&gt; only<br>
	relative to points in time,  such as this moment,<br>
	moving backward &lt;-- into the past.  Those moments <br>
	in time that travel  backwards  into the past are <br>
	the  hash marks on the  ruler of time relative to <br>
	which forward time-motion is measured as the for-<br>
	ward time-motion that it is. Without the backward<br>
	motion of moments in time into the past, the mea-<br>
	sure of forward motion toward to the future would<br>
	not be possible.  Therefore, just as the number 1<br>
	is symmetrical, time-motion is  symmetrical, and <br>
	thus the measurement of net time-motion equals 0<br>
	such that the complete calculation of time is:<br>
<p>
	 We have just advanced one (1) second into the <br>
	 future; the nature of this advance was the <br>
	 passage of one second (-1) into the past.<br>
	 ERGO: net time = (1+(-1)) = 0<br>
<p>

	motion: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/0-time.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/0-time.htm</a> <br>
<p>
	As we can see, the structure of space-time-motion<br>
	and of the logical entity number 1 are identical:<br>
	each primary unit of space and of time are, just<br>
	like the primary logical unit, composed of two<br>
	symmetrical components the sum of which = 0. <br>
<p>
	Showing an identity between the structure of the<br>
	primary logical unit 1 and single units of space-<br>
	time-motion is a critical aspect of proving the<br>
	validity and universality of the zero-sum law.<br>
<p>
	Additional to the zero-sum of space-time-motion,<br>
	as we read in the quotation by physicist Michio <br>
	Kaku, the net sum of all energy in the universe <br>
	equals 0. Indeed, 0 is the universal constant.<br>
<p>
	All logical and physical structures, however com-<br>
	plex and  seemingly asymmetrical, are invariably <br>
	built upon the symmetrical structures of the pri-<br>
	mary 0,1 identity relation and space-time-motion,<br>
	and therefore nothing can deviate from zero-sum.<br>
<p>
	0 = (1+(-1)) + (1+(-1)) + (1+(-1)) + (1+(-1)) = 0<br>
