Yes, this is an interesting question I've thought of before. Remember she's<br>
followed around all day by body guards which look like college students. A<br>
better question might be, when is she going to get away with anything that<br>
they don't know about??? Sex? Dating? Drugs? She's a perfect target for<br>
terrorists. What if someone was to dose her with MDMA or LSD or something?<br>
What about just poison her..<br>
