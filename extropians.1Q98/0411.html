<i>&gt; I would say no, the book is not me.  It may be a blueprint or set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; instructions for rebuilding me.  If someone follows the instructions in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the book and somehow brings me back, then I would be back as me.  But I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't think the information about me or about rebuilding me equals me.</i><br>

<i>&gt; I am signed up at Alcor for suspension.  I would feel cheated if instead</i><br>
<i>&gt; of freezing my body they published a book entitled "All About Harvey</i><br>
<i>&gt; Newstrom."</i><br>
<p>
This brings to mind Hofstadter's essay "A Conversation with Einstein's<br>
Brain", in The Mind's Eye, by Hofstadter and Dennett.  In the essay is<br>
a book which is all about Einstein, having a complete model of his brain.<br>
Here is a brief description I found on the web:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A typical conversation might go something like the following: A person</i><br>
<i>&gt; writes down the statement,"How are you feeling?" onto the first page. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; person then reads and carries out the indicated rules for transforming</i><br>
<i>&gt; the written statement into simulated auditory stimuli and then into</i><br>
<i>&gt; a myriad of neuron and synapse firings and inhibitions. Finally the</i><br>
<i>&gt; responses from the speech generation centers are translated back into</i><br>
<i>&gt; the written message, " I'm not feeling anything you idiot, I'm a book!"</i><br>
<p>
(Actually I don't think the book would say that, since it would not<br>
be initially aware that it was a book, and it would in fact at least<br>
simulate feeling things.  Rather, it would say something like, "I can't<br>
see and my body feels strange, but I hear you OK and my thinking seems<br>
normal enough.")<br>
<p>
If Alcor restored you as a book, it would not be fundamentally different<br>
from restoring you as an upload who was not currently being run, or<br>
as a person who was still in suspension.  The flaw is not in the fact<br>
that you are a book vs software vs meat, but that there may not be any<br>
provision to actually run the program and allow you to experience life.<br>
<p>
If Alcor did provide such a means, some person or robot who would<br>
go through the process of updating the book and allowing you to have<br>
conversations and experiences, you might complain about your slow speed<br>
compared to the rest of the world, or possibly the limited quality of<br>
your I/O (depending on how much was incorporated in the book) but you<br>
would not have the right to complain that your resurrection had failed.<br>
