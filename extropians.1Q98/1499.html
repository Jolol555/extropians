The "trickle down" Reaganomics theory for less progressive taxes has already<br>
failed once.  See <a href="http://epn.org/prospect/22/22wolf.html">http://epn.org/prospect/22/22wolf.html</a> for a cogent<br>
discussion on the effects of the "trickle down" theory.  Wealth simply<br>
gravitated towards the upper eschelons of American society.  The theory of<br>
"trickle down" economics is that it would help the lower and middle class by<br>
creating benefits that would "trickle down" to them from the upper class (who<br>
would reap benefits from lower taxes).  The exact opposite occurred.<br>
Ironically, the deficit ballooned and the monies that the wealthy saved in<br>
taxes they then in part loaned to the American government in the form of<br>
treasury bonds to fund the deficit created by the tax savings.  Ironic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This "tax the rich" meme is destructive to the lower economic classes in the</i><br>
long run.<br>
<p>
On what basis do you make this statement?  Please refer to<br>
<a href="http://www.scruz.net/~kangaroo/4Inequality.htm">http://www.scruz.net/~kangaroo/4Inequality.htm</a> for a good discussion of how<br>
"trickle down" resulted in real dollar decreases in the incomes of the lowest<br>
60% of American society.  During the 1960s when the tax system was decidely<br>
progressive (with the highest marginal tax rate exceeding 70%) all portions of<br>
American society experiencd real wage growth.  And what about countries such as<br>
Switzerland and Sweden that have very high marginal tax rates?  They some of<br>
the highest income per capita figures in the world and they're lowest quintiles<br>
of society are not suffering or being "destroyed".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I am one of those people who makes more than $100k, but I worked and</i><br>
invested to make every penny.<br>
<p>
I also make in excess of $100k annually.  However, you good fortune and mine is<br>
a result of the capitalist system in America.  Is it untenable to be expected<br>
to pay back some of the rewards we have wrought?  How much money would we be<br>
making if the lower and middle class were not there to work and consume?  I<br>
doubt it.  Furthermore, (and these are questions of personal opinion), is it<br>
unreasonable that the ones who reap the most from the American system pay a<br>
higher portion (though still retaining ample amounts unto themselves) in return<br>
for that opportunity?  I say no.  If the tax system was such a dire spectre<br>
then people would not make money, people would not take risk... but they do.<br>
Why?  Because despite the tax system there is still significant rewards to be<br>
wrought from taking risk.  The rewards are still there.  Taxing them is not<br>
unfair.  But hording your gains to the detriment of the system that gave you<br>
the opportunity to reap them is, in my opinion, unscrupulous.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  It is government of the parasites, by the parasites, for the parasites.  I</i><br>
would rather opt out, thank you.<br>
<p>
Monaco has no income tax.  Perhaps you should try there.  I suppose you also<br>
think philanthropy is complete nonsense.  Rockefeller giving his money away for<br>
the benefit of the "parasites", Gates funding the installation of Internet<br>
access in Alabama libraries, and other such nonsense?<br>
<p>
I find it extremely ironic that on a list that looks to the future (where the<br>
concepts of sharing information and resources is generally viewed as optimal)<br>
that the spectre of individual greed rears its ugly head.<br>
