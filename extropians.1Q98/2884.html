I don't think this is due to just hating castro, but more to do with the<br>
fact that the (perceived, at least) standard of living of the US is much<br>
better than Cuba's, or any other place in latinamerica.  The fact that<br>
they go to the US is because the US let them, and so would 25% of the rest<br>
of latinamerica go if they would let them.  Open the border to mexico and<br>
see how many move north.  Even when this is quite a dangerous and heavily<br>
guarded border, millions go through.  In other words, if they would be<br>
going because they hate Castro, they could just go in a much safer way to<br>
a country where they speak the same language, but very few do.  They go<br>
instead, to a country which doesn't give them entry VISA's so that the<br>
only way left to go is sneak in in small boats or rafts.<br>

I would love to see some reference for that interesting bit of<br>
information, or preferably ten.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;              </i><br>
I never really understood the problem in there.  Didn't (or doesn't) the<br>
US have nuclear weapons pointed at Cuba? (my question is real, even though<br>
i'm guessing an answer)<br>

<p>
Not a government but an entity which is designated by some method by the<br>
voluntary members of the group or commune which the entity is going to<br>
direct.  This is a very broad definition, and this is due to the fact that<br>
anarchism in general is very ambiguous and broad.  Anarcho-capitalism is<br>
just a special case of this by setting group is equal to each indivual.<br>
In the common case, the commune is a group of people that choose to live<br>
together, and the entity that directs them are the people themselves, and<br>
usually they don't do any enforcing since there is nothing to enforce cos<br>
most private property is abolished.  (Usually means in most of the cases<br>
i've read of village setups during the spanish revolution)<br>
