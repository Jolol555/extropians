Truth Machines and Open Networks<br>
<p>
Although I’m sure this would make a nice tie-in with Jim Halperin’s<br>
“The Truth Machine” I haven’t read it, so I can’t comment.  Well I<br>
can, but that wouldn’t be fair.<br>
<p>
Imagine for a minute that the Internet is thriving, and for<br>
organisational purposes we now “mirror” real-life events, places and<br>
people inside the computer.  Mirroring a real world event, place or<br>
person inside the computer is basically the autonomous production of<br>
meta-information (see www.mirrorworlds.com).  This information can be<br>
easily organised by agents.  For instance, if I go and fill my car<br>
with petrol the transaction can be automatically made.  This is<br>
because somewhere within the network environment I’ve created a piece<br>
of information stating that I used the pump.  This just happens to be<br>
the way the World Wide Web is progressing (and if you don’t believe me<br>
ask the W3C.)<br>
<p>
All this information is then linked together and presented in a<br>
“machine-readable” fashion.  As the potential of these “mirror worlds”<br>
is realised, more and more information will be created on the network.<br>
 Eventually, every single thing you do will be stored on the network. <br>
As is the nature of the Internet, all this information will be stored<br>
in an “open” format (encryption and fast machine-based organisation<br>
doesn’t mix) on a non-centralised network.  What this means is that<br>
anyone can find out anything about anyone at anytime.  And therefore<br>
it is impossible to lie (falsifying one piece of information means<br>
falsifying *every* piece of information, as is the nature of complex<br>
hyperlinked networks.)  Concerns that this may lead to lack of privacy<br>
are, to an extent, correct.<br>
<p>
Solving crime becomes easy.  Actually, “crime” ceases to exist. <br>
Seeing what caused the crime is just as easy as seeing the crime<br>
itself.  Secrecy is no longer possible, as I’ve said this is<br>
*absolute* truth, if something is happening we will know about it.  At<br>
first this may mean the “moral majority” goes on the rampage, but<br>
where to?  There neighbours, their local politicians, their own homes?<br>
 How long will it take them to realise that their morals have become<br>
overwhelmed by this new-found openness?  How long before we all become<br>
tired of making petty judgements?  Besides, who can say what I do is<br>
wrong when I clearly see that they indulge in it every night at 8:00PM?<br>
<p>
Of course, you’re going to have to forget “Intellectual Property<br>
Rights.”  If it’s been thought of, it need never be thought of again<br>
(only improved on.)  A completely “open” economy (or Open Market) has<br>
already made a small emergence on the Internet (with several freeware<br>
products.)  Software will be the first to undergo this transition,<br>
because it can already be easily copied and distributed (piracy is a<br>
good thing.)  <br>
<p>
So would you mind giving up privacy for absolute truth?<br>
<p>

It may be bullshit, but it's inspired bullshit<br>
