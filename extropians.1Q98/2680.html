<p>
My error: I was thinking they came a bit later.  But anyway, the<br>
Articles certainly constituted "United States of America" and used that<br>
name.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This Confederation lasted</i><br>
<i>&gt; throught the war, and in 1787, a Constitutional Convention to draft a formal</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitution. The Constitution of the United States, passed by the convention in</i><br>
<i>&gt; September of 1787,was ratified in 1791 by the 9th ratifying state, New Hampshire,</i><br>
<p>
Nope.  That happened June 21, 1788.  The First Congress assembled March<br>
4, 1789.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; which also ratified the Bill of Rights, a Document of Constitutional Amendments that</i><br>
<i>&gt; was passed not by the Contitutional Convention, but by the first Congress under that</i><br>
<i>&gt; Constitution.  [...]</i><br>
<p>
Congress could not propose any Amendments before the ninth state had<br>
ratified the Constitution!<br>
<p>
Congress proposed a dozen Amendments on September 25, 1789; ten of them<br>
received the last of the necessary ratifications December 15, 1791. <br>
(The remaining founder states - Massachusetts, Georgia and Connecticut -<br>
ratified them in 1939.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So it took 15 years for the US Constitution to come into effect.</i><br>
<p>
Um, okay -- this is true in one sense, but false in at least three<br>
better senses.  The first constitution of the United States of America<br>
was adopted within five years; the second was adopted within thirteen<br>
years; it was slightly modified two years later, as you so rightly point<br>
out; it has been more deeply modified several times since.  Not to<br>
belittle the Bill of Rights, but it has little or no effect on the<br>
*structure* of the government.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; so it has very little in relation to the Constitution other than sharing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; same author.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Well, the institutional author of the Constitution was a successor</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to the institutional author of the Declaration, but that's about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And Thomas Jefferson was both the Author of the D of I as well as the Preamble of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Constitution.</i><br>
<p>
Neat trick: in 1787 he was in France.<br>
