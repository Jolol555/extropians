<i> &gt;a year earlier than expected!</i><br>
<p>
It gets even better:<br>
Many Management Information Systens and logistical/inventory programs and<br>
such use future dates for all kinds of operations. Depending on their (lack<br>
of) Y2K readiness and the customizing done by users these programs will<br>
start failing anytime now and some already have.<br>
I posted a rather juicy example to the list in oktober:<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;A few months ago a large European distributer lost several million dollars</i><br>
<i> &gt;because their inventory system labeled product for destruction that had an</i><br>
<i> &gt;experation date 2000 or later (the system interpreted this as 1900 so the</i><br>
<i> &gt;product were several decades over-date). The labeled products were</i><br>
<i> &gt;automatically moved from the warehouse to a container bound for a</i><br>
<i> &gt;destruction-site.</i><br>
<i> &gt;This company had received a letter warning them for this problem in 1988,</i><br>
<i> &gt;the management just sat on it and now they are implementing a new system</i><br>
<i> &gt;round-the-clock in 3 8-hour shifts. The company won't be making much profit</i><br>
<i> &gt;this year, or next year.</i><br>
<p>
But it's not just computers, all kinds of electronic appliances nowadays<br>
have integrated circuits. Often these are bought from small subcontracting<br>
companies and by now no-one knows the exact design of many of these<br>
circuits. Is your VCR Y2K compliant? The hardware of your PC? The time-lock<br>
of your bank (it stays closed on sundays)?<br>
<p>
I also read somewhere (but have not been able to confirm it) that the<br>
GPS-navigation satellites will 'run out of dates' by the end of _this_<br>
year. It seems their calender is based on counting weeks since 1-1-1980 and<br>
by next september or something they will run out of memory. Can anyone<br>
confirm this story?<br>
<p>
Greetings &amp; don't worrie _too_ much ;-)<br>
