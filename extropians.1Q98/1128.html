I don't want to exchange Dynamic Optimism for Dynamic Pessimism, but I've<br>
heard this song before...   Slave labor was supposed to do this, then steam<br>
engines, then electricity, then nuclear power, then solar power, and now<br>
computers, robots, nanites and genetic engineering.  It ain't gonna happen!<br>
<p>
In the super-future, I with my Jupiter-sized brain will reconfigure whole<br>
galaxies in a day's work.  My boss will yell at me for not remaking two<br>
galaxies in that time.  I will only have enough money to buy a small<br>
sub-universe, and will have to mortgage my next 47 galaxy remakes to pay<br>
for my coveted universe enlarger upgrade.<br>
<p>
No matter how much more power we get, we'll want more.  No matter how much<br>
work we can produce, our bosses will want more.  No matter how much profit<br>
we make, there will be more things to spend it on.  It's like network<br>
bandwidth.  For every doubling in network speed, we quadruple our data<br>
bandwidth with more 3-D animated graphics and full featured sound.  The<br>
more powerful the network gets, the slower our web browsers go.  The more<br>
choices we have in our life, the harder it is to choose.<br>
<p>
I am rushing toward the future as fast as I can, but it will be a fast and<br>
furious future.  There will be no time for sitting on our<br>
Boundlessly-Expanding Butts while robots feed us grapes.<br>
<p>
. . . Or, am I just reading to much Cyberpunk?<br>
