<i>&gt; Mark, what was the purpose of your libertarian rant? Do you think Mr. Bailey</i><br>

Well, let's just say I get a little hot under the collar when someone promotes a <br>
form of slavery. I think I'm entitled to get a little emotional, just as the <br>
anti-slavery people were in the early 1800's. I suppose I should assume that the <br>
people on this list are familiar with libertarianism, unlike the general public.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; There's a reason why debating the basics on this list is discouraged: few</i><br>
<i>&gt; of us learn anything from it. This is especially true of messages that agree</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the prevailing ideology on the list.</i><br>
<p>
OK, you make a good point. I won't bring up the topic again. <br>
