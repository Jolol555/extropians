<i>&gt; based only on his original brain state. The man does the opposite of</i><br>

I think this is true.  The whole argument about people who do the opposite<br>
of what you predict doesn't shed much light on free will, in my opinion.<br>
<p>
Imagine a computer program which outputs a 0 or 1.  You are supposed to<br>
type in your prediction of what it will output, and then it prints out<br>
its choice.  Now write the program so that regardless of what you input,<br>
it prints out the opposite value.  This is a trivial program, about three<br>
lines long.  Most people would agree that it does not have free will.<br>
<p>
Or, imagine an even simpler system, a pendulum which swings from left<br>
to right in one second.  Back and forth it goes.  You are supposed to<br>
predict where it will be in one second.  If you think it will be at the<br>
right, you "tell" the pendulum this by setting the bob to the right,<br>
and similarly if you think it will be at the left.  But, it appears that<br>
your prediction is wrong, because whichever side you set the bob at,<br>
after one second it is at the opposite side.<br>
<p>
This does not reflect any true inability to predict the future of these<br>
systems.  It simply means that the system has the property that when the<br>
prediction is input in a certain way, it affects the output.  Even quite<br>
trivial systems have this property, and it doesn't have anything to do<br>
with free will.<br>
