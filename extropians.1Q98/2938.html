Michael, where do you find your informations? In what kind of "reader's<br>
digest"-like  tabloid ? By "rioting" do you mean the traditional use of<br>
strike (which is part of worker's rights in any democratic country)?  By<br>
"violence" do you mean the few burned cars (without any corporal<br>
violence) which occured last year (under the precedent, right winged<br>
government, by the way). If those events were rioting and violence how<br>
do you call the riots of Los Angeles a few years ago ? Nuclear war?<br>
Apocaplyptic grey goo ???<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;yet the conservative</i><br>
<i>&gt;government policies of the last several years can be credited with the</i><br>
recent slow<br>
<i>&gt;easing of inflation and unemployment there,</i><br>
<p>
unemployment grow steadily during the conservative governments, which,<br>
btw increased the taxes (you, libertarian ? or are there "good taxes" ,<br>
conservative ones which affect middle class people, and "bad ones",<br>
liberal ones, which concerns big fortunes and big enterprises ?).<br>
Inflation was stopped by the socialist government before 1993,but this<br>
was perhaps, according to some economists,  a cause for unemployment<br>
(but being not an economist, and not having the arrogance to rant<br>
constantly about topics I know nothing about, I have no idea on this).<br>
Unemployment has been slowing down for the four last monthes now, and<br>
economy is getting better. (this has been noticed by independant<br>
organizations, generally unkind with the government: they are not "cuban<br>
statistics"). Frankly, I doubt the present governement can be the cause<br>
of this(I repeat: I'm not an economist), but, sure, at least it didn't<br>
kill this new slow renewal by persecuting the middle class, which is<br>
precisely the one which consumes goods.(a thing that even a<br>
non-economist like me can understand, but seems completely new to a<br>
french conservative, too busy to flatter his rich clients)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;though this past weeks elections would seem</i><br>
<i>&gt;to indicate this will end and France will fall further down the tubes,</i><br>
and possibly out<br>
<i>&gt;of the EU common money system for the time being. Those European</i><br>
nations that have<br>
<i>&gt;mirrored the US economic policies are sitting in the best positions for</i><br>
leadership in<br>
<i>&gt;the new economy there.</i><br>
<p>
Two monthes ago, europeans financial institutions confirmed that France<br>
had succesfully reduced its deficit toward the goal of 3 1/2 %(a thing<br>
the precedent  conservative governement, was totally unable to do) and<br>
will be able to be among the first group of nations for the 1999<br>
rendez-vous of Euro.<br>
I heard Tony Blair saying in an interview that England (which mirrored<br>
the most US policies) was for the moment unable to do it . I don't know<br>
if it's true, but at least I quote my sources.<br>
<p>
Ah, I promised myself to stay away from this noisy discussion. Too<br>
late...<br>
<p>
Remi<br>
