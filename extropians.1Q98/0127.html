hand... <br>
<p>
I disagree on the one-third-of-the-populace-behind-them argument.  I think you<br>
need much less, but you also must be certain that the rest of the people are<br>
less<br>
united and don't care.  In other words, if 10% of the people support you and<br>
have<br>
the will and dough while the rest have neither and don't care, I think you'd<br>
have a<br>
good chance.  The problem is that today most people who contemplate revolution<br>
are not the sort of people I'd like to see succeed.  In fact, they look a<br>
little too much<br>
like the current rulers!  (Recall Timothy McVeigh was a decorated veteran of the<br>
Persian Gulf War.)<br>
 <br>
In real life, I'd rather see a revolution of the peaceful sort, especially<br>
of changing<br>
enough people over to our side.  And keep others neutral.  Someone once said,<br>
no everyone needed to be enlightened during the Enlightenment, and look what<br>
came from that.  (Can you tell me who said this?:)<br>
<p>
But my original point was that there is a difference between morality and<br>
legality --<br>
or what is right and wrong and what should be up to the law -- whether enforced<br>
by a government or what have you -- to decide.  Does anyone agree with me<br>
on this?<br>
