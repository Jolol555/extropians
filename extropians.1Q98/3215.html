<i>&gt;Two possibilities (AFAIKT):</i><br>

<i>&gt;explain why there are still many people smoking cigarettes, climbing</i><br>
<i>&gt;mountians and riding bikes without a helmet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. Libertarianism is not in the best interest of most people and they vote</i><br>
<i>&gt;accordingly (for a minority group it is, or seems to be, in their best</i><br>
<i>&gt;interests and they also vote accordingly).</i><br>
<p>
You forgot the third possibility:<br>
<p>
3.  People don't believe that it is in their long term interests.  Either<br>
they have never heard arguments for libertarianism or they simply believe<br>
these arguments to be incorrect.<br>
<p>
The third is a highly relevant factor in this situation; after all, we're<br>
having this discussion, aren't we?  Of course, Possibility 3 alone is<br>
sufficient to kill elections, which may explain why the libertarian party<br>
isn't as large as it might be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Personally I think it's a combination of both. If a true libertarian party</i><br>
<i>&gt;wins a national election in the US or a major European country and that</i><br>
<i>&gt;country is still well (preferrebly better) after few years I'll change my</i><br>
<i>&gt;opinion and congratulate everybody on this list who had more foresight than</i><br>
<i>&gt;I did.</i><br>
<p>
This is a good policy; the economy is rather complex and there may be some<br>
factors which I have not yet thought of.  My bet is on that state which<br>
chooses libertarianism growing rich within about twenty or thirty years.<br>
<p>
Best of luck!<br>
