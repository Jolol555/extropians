I've been thinking a _lot_ about this since I joined this list last august<br>
and I'll try to explain my viewpoint as it is now. Philosophically speaking<br>
I can't justify forced income redistribution by a state (even a democratic<br>
one). But:<br>
<p>
If the state can't redistribute income, the state can't exist, it needs<br>
resources to provide the kind of high-level services single individuals<br>
can't buy and most companies can't provide (see my example below).<br>
Redistributing income is much more than welfare, tax-funded security<br>
(police) is also a kind of income-redistribution, the rich paying for the<br>
security of the poor to some extend. So, if I'm not mistaken, you're saying<br>
that you want no governement whatsoever.<br>
<p>
OK.<br>
To this I can only say that AFAIKT absence of some kind of governing body<br>
leads to a very unconstructive chaos that makes it very hard for people to<br>
actually do what they're good at. Instead they are kept busy with personal<br>
security and ensuring all kinds of other basics that we can take for granted.<br>
<p>
I'll be the first to aknowledge that states themselves have done some<br>
pretty bad things throughout history but I can also give some examples<br>
where people seem to be reasonably happy with their state. Democratic<br>
representation and a 'trias politica' seem to be the lesser evil (IMHO). I<br>
know of no example where stateless situations have lead to stable,<br>
high-tech, prosperous communities (but am willing to listen to interesting<br>
examples). <br>
<p>
Of course it can be argued that untill now the conditions have always been<br>
wrong for an anarcho-capitalistic society to succed but this is pretty much<br>
the same arguments that hard-line communists use when they defend their<br>
system: "No, no, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot weren't true communists, but when<br>
we take power things will be different." We've had a whole bunch of<br>
large-scale social experiments this century and almost everyone some form<br>
og genocide occured.<br>
<p>
Structural changes to a complex system as society should be done gently and<br>
_very_ carefully. A system-crash can (and has) cost millions of lives.<br>
<p>
I'll try to give an example of problem I think only a state-like<br>
organisation can solve (it's a bit nationalistic but bear with me ;-).<br>
<p>
In 1953 a large part of Holland was flooded when a combination of<br>
high-tides and storm occured. The dike system protecting<br>
lower-than-sea-level land was breached and about 2000 people drowned. I<br>
response to this the Dutch governement implemented the Delta-plan. Over a<br>
perion of 33 years over a $10^12 was invested in upgrading all dike-systems<br>
so that an occurrance like the '53 flood could never occur again. The final<br>
construction was finished last year, two giant doors that can close a<br>
canal's opening into the sea.<br>
<p>
I've been trying to think how a commercial organisation could have achieved<br>
such a thing. Who would invest in such a project? Who would 'buy' the end<br>
product?<br>
I believe that only a state has the means and the organisation to pull<br>
something like that off. Can anyone think of a scenario where companies<br>
would have made something like the Internet? (a free-to-use-for-all utility).<br>
<p>
I don't like the fact that a state is needed so that people can live<br>
together but for now I firmly believe it is the lesser evil.<br>
<p>
