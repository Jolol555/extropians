<i>&gt;  &gt;"at conception". If so, I'd like to hear the reasoning behind it.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Developing our own selves is our own business. Developing other selves is</i><br>

<i>&gt;  &gt;ownership of other selves is quite another. I will take the question of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;when "fetal tissue" - a dehumanizing definition, as Anders said, propaganda</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;developed against the enemy</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What enemy? I'm sorry, but this sounds like you're picketing in front of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; clinic or something (or maybe it's just my reli-fanatic-alarm going off?).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;The process of developing another self begins with</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;conception,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since the fetus at this stage is nearly indistinguisable from most other</i><br>
<i>&gt; mammals and many other vertebrates that would mean that a pig fetus has the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same value &amp; rights as a human, after birth the fetus somehow loses that</i><br>
<i>&gt; value/those right and it's ok to use it as a source of protein. Unless, of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course, you believe that a human fetus has something called a 'soul' from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the moment of conception.</i><br>
<p>
I find it most hypocritically ironic that liberals who would go into apopleptic<br>
fits if I shot a wild animal don't even sniff if a human fetus is aborted  in a<br>
rather gruesome manner minutes prior to birth.<br>
<p>
I approve of abortion, the death penalty, the right to suicide, legality of<br>
assisted suicide, self defense with deadly weapons, and the hunting of and<br>
consumption of animals. At least someone here is consistent.<br>
<p>
My cousin's doctoral adviser's 8 year old said at dinner the other day,"If God<br>
didn't want us to kill and eat animals, he wouldn't have made them out of meat."<br>
