<i>&gt; We had an interesting discussion today at a course in biological</i><br>

<i>&gt; that Prozac makes people feel better and gets them out of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; depression, but they have a large probability of relapse. CBT on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other hand works even better and has a fairly good prognosis</i><br>
<i>&gt; afterwards. The combination of CBT and Prozac isn't synergetic, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; just as good as CBT alone. On the other hand, Prozac can help people</i><br>
<i>&gt; out from the really deep depression so that they can start with</i><br>
<i>&gt; CBT. What makes the difference is that Prozac doesn't give you any</i><br>
<i>&gt; strategies of keeping out of the depressive state, while CBT attempts</i><br>
<i>&gt; to.</i><br>

That's the thing about "genius chemicals" vs. set and setting: I don't<br>
think any chemical substance, even a complex mixture of different<br>
neurotransmitters can really help you achieve new insights. The only<br>
thing chemicals can do is change the mood you're in, or even change the<br>
way how your brain works - but not what kind of thoughts your brain<br>
produces. That's what set and setting are all about...<br>
<p>
For technologically changing "the kind of thoughts" your brain produces,<br>
you probably need to stimulate the brain much more directly (like<br>
inducing certain types of neurotransmitters in certain parts of the<br>
brain - or finally connecting neurons to computers ;-) )<br>
