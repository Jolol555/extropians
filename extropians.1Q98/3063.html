You may want to watch this program on the Discovery Channel today at 9<br>
I have not seen it, but here's a review from usenet:<br>

-------------------------------------------------<br>
My experiments with the "BEAM-type" neural-cores, as described in Mark<br>
Tilden's patent, that I did 2 years back convinced me that it was basically<br>
a chaotic process that a human could read "order" into, and that the<br>
"problems" it "solved" were merely solved *BY* the trying of randomly<br>
selected interference with a circulating trigger pulse train in a loop of<br>
RC delay circuits, and that any random process would tend to LOOK<br>
"organized" if it periodically accidentally did the "right thing", whereas<br>
when it did the "wrong thing", it simply didn't suffer as much failure,<br>
since the chance of a robot with its legs bent backwards "ratcheting"<br>
itself "backwards" in an "anti-progress" direction were less than going<br>
"forward", so it "LOOKS LIKE" it's solving a "problem"! But it doesn't<br>
maintain that rhythm once "learned", and it only happens upon it again when<br>
it is similarly challenged. That might look "purposeful" to you, but any<br>
ratcheting device, when shaken, will go in one direction only!! The overall<br>
principle has "SOMETHING" to do with Complex Adaptive Systems, and they're<br>
cute as hell, but that's about all the "robotics" *I* happen to think is<br>
truly in the design!! And as for the photo-charging-triggering circuit, it<br>
is really rather an old concept used in relaxation oscillators from tubes<br>
to UJT's!! It's now cheap and feasible, but there's nothing truly new at<br>
all technically! I would hate to call Mark Tilden and Brosl Hosslacher at<br>
LANL charlatans, but they don't seem to have explained much, and certainly<br>
seem to have snowed the hell out of the producers of "Robots Rising" on<br>
the Discovery Channel, aired on last weekend and due to be aired again this<br>
weekend, leading off with the insipid old analog vs digital chestnut which<br>
everybody knows is a fairytale who knows electronics and set theory!! They<br>
spouted some genuine nonsense about the complexity being Sagan's and<br>
Sagan's of times more promising than "nasty old binary digital", when they<br>
have no more idea how it works or how to program it than they did when they<br>
popularized it, it sure seems to me!! I see nothing "smarter" or "newer"<br>
in his 'Robotic Jurassic Park' than was seen several years ago. I am having<br>
trouble figuring out why he gets paid at all to do this stuff, or for how<br>
long he might go on fooling people, without showing us what the heck the<br>
grant money and Nationally Owned Facilities he has been using have netted<br>
us, the taxpayers!! Los Alamos National Labs seems to think there's promise<br>
there, but for the life of me I don't know why they think so!! Looks like a<br>
hobby or artform to me! Now "ALife" at Santa fe Institute looks FAR more<br>
promising, and the show gave it short shrift as to content or explanation.<br>
I think they figured it wouldn't "hold an audience" if it all "happened<br>
inside a computer's mind", which isn't true at all if you've seen the<br>
motile evolution simulations in three space fluids and on a gravitic<br>
surface!! It came up with most LIVING forms of motility in a startlingly<br>
small number of generations! I have it on videotape off yet ANOTHER<br>
special probably off Discovery Channel, which, if a bit underinformed, at<br>
least has NEW stuff ONCE in a great while!! They need some advisors to tell<br>
them what is really worthy of a hard look and what is overblown!! So what<br>
ELSE is new for a bunch of journalistic film majors!! It's all sci-fi to<br>
them anyway!!<br>
