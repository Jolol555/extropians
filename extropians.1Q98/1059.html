Minor point: even insulin-dependent diabetics who receive treatment<br>
are prone to occasionally losing track of their blood glucose level<br>
and going hypo. You can be receiving treatment and still screw up --<br>
that's all.<br>

The real linguistic mangling is in this one:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;"...not-too-uncommon cause of auto accidents"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "...causes lots of road accidents"</i><br>

<i>&gt; I'm not trying to put words into your mouth, just rephrasing what you</i><br>

<p>
Lots.   The  two statements are not equivalent, because one effectively<br>
asserts "there are lots of accidents" and the other boils down to "of<br>
those accidents that happen, many are caused by ..."<br>
<p>
<p>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On the contrary, I often help out friends who need money. But I strongly</i><br>

 <br>
Well, yeah. (I think we agree on this.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I dunno. The free market _may_ be the optimal mediational method, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;all I know;  but what I see here isn't people trying to _prove_ it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;or, alternatively, trying to invent something better: what I see </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is people taking it as a forgone conclusion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This whole century has been a series of grand experiments in finding</i><br>
<i>&gt; better ways to organise a society than a free market, and they've all </i><br>
<i>&gt; proven far worse.</i><br>
<p>
I will agree that the overt experiments -- fascism, communism -- were<br>
disastrous. But I assert that nobody has tried a 100% free market,<br>
either; while markets exist, they're all controlled. And those attempts<br>
at finding better ways to organise society haven't exhausted the<br>
space of possible solutions -- they haven't even scratched the surface!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Noone has ever done any better, but as I've said</i><br>
<i>&gt; many times before, the great advantage of a free society is that those</i><br>
<i>&gt; who wish to try alternate ways of living can go off and set up their</i><br>
<i>&gt; own voluntary communities to test them out. If one of them turns out</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be better than a free market then you can be sure that most people</i><br>
<i>&gt; will soon join them.</i><br>
<p>
What about network externalities? How do you test a new system for <br>
viability within the scope of an existing system?<br>
<p>
(My head aches ... )<br>
