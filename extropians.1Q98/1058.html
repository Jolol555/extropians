Dead right it isn't; becuase the letter "l" is fairly simple. Instead,<br>
try looking at a very high-resolution true-colour image of the<br>
Mandelbrot set. You can fit it inside the 2% or so of your visual<br>
field that the fovea covers, and you'll see a lot more detail on it<br>
than that nice courier-medium letter "l" on your terminal ;-)<br>

<p>
The fovea handles about 50% of the sensory bandwidth of the entire<br>
retina, if I remember correctly. The rest isn't just "motion sensors",<br>
but it's not far off. (You can get an idea of this by wandering around<br>
in the near-total dark; the cones in your fovea are no use in low light<br>
levels, so you're reduced to using your peripheral vision (mostly rods).<br>
