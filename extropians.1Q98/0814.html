eyehi &lt;eyehi@geocities.com&gt; asked:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What kind of light?</i><br>
<p>
	I don't recall anything being said about the kind of light in<br>
the NPR report I heard.  Just light.  The subjects having some kind of<br>
heatless light (so they wouldn't know when the light was on or off)<br>
being directed to a pad covering the back of the knee through fiber<br>
optics I believe.  The subjects being in a sunless environment so the<br>
didn't know what time it was or something like that.  Supposedly they<br>
were able to reset their time clocks at will by properly controlling<br>
the timing of the light to the back of the knee.  They talked about<br>
the possibility of having such devices on long airplane flights and<br>
such.<br>
