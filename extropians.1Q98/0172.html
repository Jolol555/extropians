I agree that organ transplants is not a good solution (too dangerous and<br>
impossible in many cases -- the brain). Puting some bacteria to work is<br>
not a bad idea, but I don't think that to be enough. My best option is<br>
gene therapy. If we could just make a few cells immortal, these cells<br>
would spread in the body because they would be in advantage when<br>
compared to the normal aging cells. All we have to do is find a way to<br>
turn our cells immortal and improve our gene therapy techniques -- and<br>
this might not be very far away.<br>
<p>
Also on the subject, I recently wrote an article for a magazine called<br>
"Longevity Report" about the applications of gene therapy on controlling<br>
aging, it can be found at:<br>
