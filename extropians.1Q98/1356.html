I think the fears that the NSA monitors everything are somewhat<br>
overstated. <br>
<p>
First, the line-eater (the system storing all emails containing "hot"<br>
words) is an old myth (there are line-eater annoying sigfiles filled<br>
with hot words dating back to the early days of the net). The problem<br>
with it is that it is too unselective, you get far too much junk which<br>
has to be eyeball-scanned (imagine just wading through alt.conspiracy<br>
daily) - it is not cost effective even with a lot of personell. And<br>
the real terrorists and subversives of course do not email their<br>
master plans over the net in plaintext (how many terorrist groups rely<br>
on postcards for internal communication?). It is trivial to use<br>
another phrase ("Let's greet the king with the blue bolts") or<br>
encryption (not even strong encryption is needed against a<br>
line-eater).<br>
<p>
Second, large scale trawling is as far as I know an inefficient way of<br>
finding the ones you are looking for, it is a brute force<br>
search. There are better ways, which the net *does* make easy. There<br>
is great interest in finding out who communicates with whom, since<br>
this is usually much more useful to know than what they<br>
say. Clustering algorithms can easily derive your social network by<br>
checking your mail headers. A little intelligence goes a long way - if<br>
you know a suspicious person, check his network and mail, and use that<br>
information to trace further.This is apparently how the Swedish secret<br>
police SAPO tried to track down Kurdish terrorists, although that was<br>
by checking phone calls.<br>
<p>
As for Netscape sending data to the FCC, that is most certainly a myth<br>
too. Likely it is a mix up between FCC the organisation and FCC the<br>
protocol. If there was such a routine in the program, it would be<br>
trivial to dig it up and make public (remember the Microsoft trick?)<br>
and it would definitely not display what it was doing :-)<br>
 <br>
When it comes to NSA access to european phone networks, that is an<br>
interesting matter. I seem to recall that in the aftermath of WW II<br>
the US was given extremely far-reaching authority to intercept phone<br>
calls in the Bundesrepublik. How much of that access remains is a good<br>
question. When it comes to France it seems more unlikely that its<br>
government would ever allow NSA access (remember that DSDG (or<br>
whatever it is called) have been quite active when it comes to<br>
counter-espinage against the US, especially in the areas of industrial<br>
espionage). As for the rest of the continent, I think the likeliehood<br>
of outside access varies just as much (I read some semi-paranoid texts<br>
a few years back about the backdoors in BTs telephone systems; much of<br>
it seemed possible to do like the peacetime use of military routing to<br>
eavesdrop). The problem is that it is not a homogenous system, with<br>
far too many competing interests, to be consistently<br>
eavesdropped. Personally I don't worry as much about NSA as I worry<br>
about all the *other* groups who are likely trying to exploit the<br>
systems.<br>
<p>
Paranoia can be useful. But only if it is combined with critical thinking. <br>
<p>
[neuropsychology theory of the day: paranoia is caused by insufficient<br>
inhibition of little supported but threatening scenarios. Scenariosare<br>
generated all the time, but normally only the realistic ones remain to<br>
be acted on. However, if the realism-inhibitioon is weak, the scenario<br>
has a high threat value and if it can provide support for itself (even<br>
if this is through circular reasoning) it will become more active and<br>
reach the conscious level where it will cause the person to seek<br>
evidence for it, leading to paranoia. Even lover levels of inhibition<br>
will make even non-threatening scenarios more active, causing<br>
delusions. Hmm, I wonder how this fits with the models of spreading<br>
activation in semantic networks which seems to be regulated by<br>
dopamine...]<br>
