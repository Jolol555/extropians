They eliminated overtime pay for contractors making more than ~$27/hr.  As<br>
a former contractor myself, I don't see what the big deal is.  Here in<br>
California I never got overtime pay as a contractor.  Realize though, that<br>
if I chose to work a full year, I can pull in between US$150k-200k a year<br>
on a W-2.  While I think the cutoff point should be higher in this<br>
particular case (say, $40/hr) this would create a condition where you could<br>
make more money earning a theoretically smaller wage.  I actually<br>
disapprove of overtime pay in principle.<br>
<p>
Why does a person's labor become suddenly more valuable after 40hrs/week?<br>
As far as I can tell, it doesn't and therefore should not receive<br>
compensation above the usual.  If at some point you feel that your work is<br>
not being fairly compensated, you can complain, stop working, or quit.<br>
Making unusual compensation compulsory after a certain number of hours is<br>
unwarranted interference.  <br>
