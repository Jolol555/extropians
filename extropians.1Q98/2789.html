I do not think that any minister can require a teen mother to give up<br>
her child. A judge could order it, if it was determined she was "unfit"<br>
or unable to care for it.<br>

I will have to track down some specific sources for you. However, I do <br>
think it is well established that kids from single parent homes are more<br>
likely to end up in prison. Of course, most kids from single parent<br>
homes turn out fine, but that doesn't mean it's the optimal situation.<br>
Didn't you ever wish you had a father? I'm sorry you didn't have the<br>
experience. Provided he's a decent fellow, it is good for kids to have<br>
one around. <br>
