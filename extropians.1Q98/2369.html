Reilly: I should know better than to get involved in an abortion<br>
discussion. However, I find you and I are usually in agreement<br>
philosophically, so I'm curious to discover why we diverge so clearly here.<br>

<i>&gt;Enemy?  Why, the mother's unborn child and how it's viewed, </i><br>
<p>
I don't know any defender of the legality of abortion who views fetuses as<br>
"the enemy". I think this is a straw man. Yes, an unwanted pregnancy can<br>
interfere with life plans, but that doesn't one views the embryo as an<br>
enemy. One might have the abortion with regret that it happened.<br>
<p>
Personally, I do regard abortions as nasty things, to be avoided as much as<br>
possible. Abortions should not be the choice of birth control. But other<br>
forms of birth control can fail, despite responsible use. And, even more<br>
certainly, women who have been raped should not have to see through a<br>
pregnancy. I assume you disagree, even in such a case. Is that correct?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;to this, in fact, I think I heard the pilot light on the camp ovens turn</i><br>
<i>&gt;on.</i><br>
<p>
Let's keep this on a less emotive level. Otherwise the other side will<br>
start painting you with the anti-woman brush.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;Since the fetus at this stage is nearly indistinguisable from most other</i><br>
<i>&gt;mammals and many other vertebrates that would mean that a pig fetus has the</i><br>
<i>&gt;same value &amp; rights as a human, after birth the fetus somehow loses that</i><br>
<i>&gt;value/those right and it's ok to use it as a source of protein.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This may be true for very primitive humanity, but for many moons now,</i><br>
<i>&gt;enlightened humanity can tell quite easily which is pig and which is human.</i><br>
<p>
Of course. A fetus is fully human in a genetic sense from fertilization.<br>
But why is this relevant? What does genetic humanity have to do with moral<br>
standing or the granting of rights? Beings of at least human personality<br>
who are not genetically human (possible ETs, genetically altered<br>
descendants of humanity, and -- you may not grant this -- future AIs) could<br>
have as strong a moral standing as you or I. Conversely, someone who is<br>
utterly brain dead, in the sense that their brain has been physically<br>
destroyed beyond all possibility of preservation and repair, may still be<br>
human but is not morally much more than a piece of meat. (A bit more simply<br>
because the physically resemblence to the former person may provide<br>
emotional reasons for according a different status to the body).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Interestingly, the same groups that want animal rights typically support</i><br>
<i>&gt;mothers murdering their unborn children.</i><br>
<p>
Interesting, yes, but that's not necessarily inconsistent. That depends on<br>
the grounds for bestowing rights, and the legitimacy of overriding those<br>
rights. Personally I don't accord rights to animals (at least not in the<br>
same sense or to the same degree). The reasons for this are the same as<br>
those for not according rights to (early) fetuses.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Likewise, the same groups that</i><br>
<i>&gt;lobbied to have alcohol and tobacco warnings for pregnancy typically</i><br>
<i>&gt;support the right to murder what the warnings are meant to protect.</i><br>
<p>
I don't see the slightest inconsistency here. If the embryo has no right to<br>
life, or that right is overriden by the self-ownership rights of the<br>
mother, abortion should be allowed. But if the intent is to keep the child<br>
and let it develop, looking to its future it may be seen as an offence to<br>
the person who it is to become to negligently cause damage. In this case,<br>
you are doing damage to the person who will exist. In the case of abortion,<br>
you are preventing a person from coming into existence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If the unborn child is just fetal</i><br>
<i>&gt;tissue, why not genetically engineer it in vitro or in utero to become a</i><br>
<i>&gt;slave or worker drone?  </i><br>
<p>
That's a different issue. Even if the fetus has no right against this, we<br>
may have other reasons not to allow such a process. I would choose a<br>
polycentric system in which genetic engineering of slaves was not allowed.<br>
But that's not because I believe such alterations violate the right of the<br>
fetus.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;The parallel-server that I'm working on has no intelligence and thus no</i><br>
<i>&gt;value&amp;rights as a consious being.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can't make sense out of this.  Are you saying that the possession of</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence is the source of rights?  How much intelligence is enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt;get on the rights wagon?  Who defines intelligence and why is it the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;as consciousness?</i><br>
<p>
Are *you* saying that the mere possession of DNA in the form of something<br>
that could develop into a human person is the source of rights? I find that<br>
very puzzling. Why should we grant rights on that basis? While I wouldn't<br>
equate intelligence and consciousness, I do think they are closely related<br>
(since I believe consciousness is a matter of degree). And yes, I suggest<br>
that rights are most sensibly according according to degree of<br>
intelligence, above some minimum. In general it isn't wise to give some<br>
adult humans rights that others don't have, though there are exceptions --<br>
deeply mentally retarded humans will not have all the usual rights, such as<br>
agreeing to contracts.<br>
<p>
I don't believe that rights are entities that exist in themselves. They are<br>
simply principles that we agree on that regulate the use of force. We<br>
*could* grant fetuses full rights, but why should we? Why should we grant<br>
them full rights any more than we should grant such rights to birds, bees,<br>
or beetles?<br>
<p>
BTW, I find it implausible grant full rights even to a newborn baby. They<br>
are no more a person than is a seven-month old fetus (though either of<br>
these are much closer to being a person than is a month-old fetus).<br>
Nevertheless, I grant the view that it should be illegal to kill such<br>
babies now that they are biologically separate -- but the source of that<br>
rule does not have to be a right of the baby.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;Maybe all it takes is a processor-upgrade and smarter software? That would</i><br>
<i>&gt;mean that this 'lump of metal' is a potential consious being. O dear. What</i><br>
<i>&gt;right do I have feeding it all these problems that I want to have solved.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is strange reasoning.  Where do you think rights come from?  If we are</i><br>
<i>&gt;unconscious, say when we're sleeping or in a coma, do our rights go away?</i><br>
<p>
That's a strange question. :-)  Do you cease to a person when you sleep?<br>
No. But a fetus is not yet a person. When you're asleep you still have your<br>
abilities and capacities, and you are still in the middle of your projects<br>
and activities.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;If everything that has the potential of becoming a human has the rights of</i><br>
<i>&gt;a human then we're comitting mass-murder every time we have sex.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't know who you are arguing against here, but it's certainly not me. </i><br>
<i>&gt;A fertilized egg with a normal full set of chromosomes is the starting</i><br>
<i>&gt;point for human development, not earlier.</i><br>
<p>
True, but it's not the beginning of development of personhood, and it's<br>
personhood to which rights should attach, not genetic humanity. The early<br>
fetus is not only not a person yet, it's not even a human being, since it<br>
doesn't have all the parts of a human, especially the brain. I still don't<br>
see that you have given any reason why we should accord rights to this<br>
clump of tissue. You can call this language "dehumanizing" if you like, but<br>
I would say your use of "murdering children" is inappropriating humanizing.<br>
So there!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My alternative is polycentrism, or particularism, many jurisdictions trying</i><br>
<i>&gt;out many different treatments of the issue.  The judiciary cannot usurp the</i><br>
<i>&gt;legislative role.  Individuals should have the choice to move to</i><br>
<i>&gt;jurisdictions that honor life, or that worship death.  </i><br>
<p>
Reilly, it's not a fair tactic to call advocates of abortion rights death<br>
worshippers. That's just obviously false, and will only mean those who<br>
disagree won't take your views seriously.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;disincentive for movement, but I know from moral reasoning from first</i><br>
<i>&gt;principles that families trying to raise children will be drawn towards</i><br>
<i>&gt;jurisdictions with an ethic of protecting and enhancing life.</i><br>
<p>
But protecting and enhancing life includes the lives of the parents. These<br>
are not well protected or enhanced by making abortion illegal. That would<br>
be true even if abortions would not carry on anyway, with nasty<br>
consequences. Life is not only about survival. A developed person's right<br>
to life must include the right to remove interferences with that life when<br>
that interference results from something that is not a person.<br>
<p>
I want to make clear here that I dislike abortion. I would like to see<br>
solutions that ensure ALL pregnancies are wanted. I would also counsel<br>
anyone considering an abortion to think long and hard about it. For many<br>
people I think the best choice is to have the baby and give it for<br>
adoption, if the parents do not want to raise it. I would certainly (if in<br>
possession of the facts) criticize morally some couples who opt for<br>
abortion instead of adoption, especially if pregnancy resulted from<br>
irresponsibility. But even in such cases I would not use the force of the<br>
law to prevent abortion.<br>
<p>
BTW, according to my mother, I was a mistake my parents made when she was<br>
35 (quite old for a pregnancy in the '60s). They didn't abort my precursor,<br>
and I'm glad. But I'd hate to think that, if they had, someone would come<br>
and drag my mother to jail for protecting her own life and purposes by<br>
removed a small lump of biological matter than didn't have a personality<br>
and didn't think and didn't have goals and projects.<br>
