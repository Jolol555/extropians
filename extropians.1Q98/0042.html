<i>&gt; &gt;There's a better example in his "Diamond Age" but I forget what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;they were called....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Funny you should mention  "The Diamond Age", I have it at my elbow</i><br>
<i>&gt; (re-reading) Are you refering to the neo-Victorians, the Ashanti,or</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of the many other "Phyles" mentioned.</i><br>
<p>
The Ashanti I think. As I recall they were stateless (?) but would rapidly<br>
congregate in support of a citizen, or to avenge the citizen, if such were<br>
the case.<br>
<p>
I may be wrong about the statelessness of the phyle. There was also the<br>
distributed nation who kidnap one of the characters, which strikes me as<br>
being very close to an ideal nation, if you feel you need to belong to some<br>
sort of extended social grouping for defense or other purposes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't recall what phyle is short for, if I remember I'll let you</i><br>
<i>&gt; know. </i><br>
<p>
My brother is in a mediaeval re-enactment group, doing viking stuff<br>
(Varangian Guard stuff, actually, but anyways), and they train in "files",<br>
a "file" being (I think) seven men and a "file" leader. It's seven or eight<br>
or so.<br>
<p>
Curious. I thought it might be a biological term, or some sort of<br>
graeco-latin phrase.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you recall from the book our skull gun packing friend Bud</i><br>
<i>&gt; assaulted a member of the Ashanti (who were a tribe and not just a</i><br>
<i>&gt; phyle) as a result of which a large team of Ashanti flew in and</i><br>
<i>&gt; searched out the perpetrator, and placed him under "personnel</i><br>
<i>&gt; arrest". They immediately sought out the proper authorities and you</i><br>
<i>&gt; recall the rest. (no spoiler here) This is one possibility.</i><br>
<p>
aha! Yes. But did they have an actual state? I seem to recall that they<br>
were more of a mobile distributed mutual self-defense league, or federation<br>
of independent individuals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nicely done I might add.</i><br>
<p>
It set off all sorts of idea-storms in my head, that book. Aside from being<br>
a fairly good author, he excels in coming up with new ideas as well as<br>
making established ideas seem very familiar and commonplace, which made the<br>
whole book hang together as a very believable near-future story.<br>
