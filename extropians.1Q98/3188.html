<i>&gt; From: =- deluxe -= &lt;jeff@ultraviolet.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Personally, I'm shocked at the lack of press coverage over the Y2k</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem. As many of you CS know, its only a matter of time now before</i><br>
<i>&gt; our country and many of the worlds economic structures take their worst</i><br>
<i>&gt; beatings in history. Does anyone know of a website which organizes the</i><br>
<i>&gt; information in a professional/scientific assessment?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've only heard a little in the press. This is probably because they</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't want to exacerbate the problem by having people with lots of money</i><br>
<i>&gt; withdrawing their portions from the world banks.. but that's only a</i><br>
<i>&gt; small part of the hysteria this computer malfunction could bring on..</i><br>
<p>
But how bad will it really be? How will the y2k problem affect simple <br>
things like your PC, web access and email? For example, can we <br>
expect this list to crash? (now *there's* something really serious)... <br>
<p>
Something else: everybody's talking about the negative sides of this<br>
alleged crash, but as with most disasters there must be ways to<br>
(greatly) profit from it. Although most people got hit in for example<br>
the crash of '29, some became millionaires overnight. There must be<br>
ways to profit from the (potential) chaos that will follow the y2k<br>
problem, and not just as a programmer. It would be stupid to let<br>
a golden opportunity like this one pass...Any suggestions? ;-)<br>
