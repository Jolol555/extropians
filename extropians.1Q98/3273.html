It might be profitable  to deal with those entities which are slacking in<br>
their duties. Remember if enough people are harmed, you can form a class<br>
action lawsuit. It woud be very useful to fund extropian projects from the<br>
lawsuit profits taken in punitive damages won in court from corporations or<br>
government agencies which are not fulfilling their legal responsibilities to<br>
keep current. Make it too expensive to run those agencies due to the legal<br>
liabilities in the dockets and the gov't might even shut down and disband<br>
those bureaucracies... the possibilities for mischeif dazzle the mind. Even<br>
if losses are insured, in court you can stilll sue for damages and have the<br>
fact that you've already been recompensed excluded from evidence.<br>
<p>
Using the system against itself for acheiving extropian ends and in helping<br>
to increase the obsolescence of the old order is something that the legal<br>
minded amongst us might look into.....Your thoughts, Mr. Burch???<br>
