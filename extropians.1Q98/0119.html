<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I think we disagree on what constitutes child abuse. I do not consider a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;few whacks on the butt after a kid has just about killed a cat (an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;action that I believe would be considered a crime in all states) to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;abuse. Now if this father hits his kid 5 times a day for any old reason,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;well, then I might agree with you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My point is that if things get that far, there is probably no hope for the child</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway.  Some corporal punishment might avoid him from doing it in front</i><br>
<i>&gt; of his parents again, but the child has already demonstrated he has little</i><br>
<i>&gt; value for life and is willing to lash out at innocents.  My question: since most</i><br>
<i>&gt; kids don't do this sort of thing, why did he?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think 7 is too late to turn a kid around. (And I don't believe anyone of any <br>
age is ever totally hopeless, do you?) OK, a few whacks on the butt alone is not <br>
likely to do turn the kid around, but obviously this kid needs some severe <br>
punishment and should be brought in to see a good therapist. Have you heard about <br>
the "tough love" concept? The idea is that you take away all privileges from a <br>
misbehaving child and gradually give them back when the kid starts behaving again. I <br>
understand this approach often works.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I also believe that parents should have broad discretion regarding how</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;they raise their kids, not because they are stronger , but because they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;are paying the bills! If that includes an occasional whack on the butt,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'm not going to interfere.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I never claimed I'd interfere.  There is a difference between believing</i><br>
<i>&gt; something is wrong and believing it should be forcibly prohibited.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; often think wholesale slaughter of politicians is wrong, yet I doubt I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would lift a finger to stop it.  (OK, I would cheer it on!:)</i><br>
<p>
OK, however, there are some nut cases at Social Services who would like to take kids <br>
away from their parents because they got a spanking. As for the wholesale slaughter <br>
of politicians-well, you are justified in killing people in self defence if there is <br>
no other way to protect your liberties. However, you are a damn fool if you go on <br>
the Internet and advocate specific people be knocked off.<br>
<p>
To digress a bit-take the Oklahoma City bombers- please. What cowardly morons! Do <br>
they try to take out anyone important? (I am not advocating this.) Nope, they <br>
indiscriminately kill innocent children and low level government officials. Also, <br>
they didn't have the sense to realize that in order to start a violent revolution, <br>
you need about a third of the population on your side to have any chance at all. <br>
George Washington, for example, had about a third of the colonists on his side and <br>
he knew damned well that there was a hangman's noose in store for him if he lost. He <br>
took full responsibility for what he was doing. You don't see many people of such <br>
high character these days. Yes, he had his major faults-he owned slaves( which, to <br>
his credit, he freed after his death) and he wasn't a pure libertarian, but the man <br>
had mostly good principles and a lot of courage. Contrast William Jefferson (I gag <br>
associating him with our 3rd President) Clinton. But back to the topic at hand... <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, when I was hit, I never thought I was wrong, I just thought I needed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; to get even.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Well, were you wrong? If so, I guess being hit was not effective. When I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;got belted, it was always for a good reason and it impressed on me (pun</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;intended) the fact that if I misbehaved there would be unpleasant</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;consequences.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; At least your parents were consistent then.  My own experience, and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; mine alone (I also mean seeing how other abusive parents behaved) was</i><br>
<i>&gt; that punishment was inflicted for any number of reasons and almost never</i><br>
<i>&gt; fit the crime in its intensity and duration.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that inconsistent and arbitrary punishment is worthless.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; In the example that Mark D. Fulwiler used, of a kid kicking a cat into</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; unconsciousness, we should ask Why did the kid think this would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; "work" as a solution to not getting his way?  I think it is because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; kid was spoiled already.  I've noticed that parents who abuse tend</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; also to spoil.  They go through cycles of heavy abuse and spoiling</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; permissiveness, often because they feel guilty about the abuse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; The child then grows up with unreal expectations -- he or she does</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; not know if any encounter will be injurious or indulgent.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Well, maybe. However, there are excellent parents who sometimes have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;problem children despite their best efforts. I would be interested in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;why the kid kicked the cat, but wouldn't you agree that the kid should</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;get some punishment (and a severe one at that) for this really vile act?</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I agree here.  Of course, something should befall the child.  I just hate to</i><br>
<i>&gt; see these things brought up as isolated incidents.  Sometimes, parents</i><br>
<i>&gt; do have a problem child and only massive intervention might ever change</i><br>
<i>&gt; that, but I feel in most cases this is not so.  I think the family is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; training</i><br>
<i>&gt; ground for how the child deals with the rest of the world and life.  Ergo,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's why I ask why that child would do what he did.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Shouldn't actions have consequences? If not, I'm afraid this awful</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;little kid may be in Juvenile Hall at age 14 for murder.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Do you really think a few beatings from now 'til then will change his</i><br>
<i>&gt; path in life?</i><br>
<p>
Probably not, but it's not outside the realm of possibility. In any event, I think <br>
you would agree that there has to be some major intervention here.<br>
<p>
I don't see the father as being a "child abuser" based on this one incident. Of <br>
course, none of us probably knows the real story here. News reports often leave out <br>
many important facts.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; I believe a few books have been written on these phenomena.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If you can cite one, I'd appreciate it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The one that first comes to my mind is Mazlish and Faber's _How to Talk</i><br>
<i>&gt; so Kid's will Listen and How to Listen so Kid's will talk_ (or is it vice</i><br>
<i>&gt; versa?).  It proved helpful in my life.</i><br>
<p>
I'll check it out.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, would you be willing to admit there must be some limits on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ways and intensities of force used by parents?  I'd hate to see someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; say, "Hitting is okay, therefore the next time Junior steals a strawberry</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the fridge, I'm going to beat him into a coma."</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Daniel Ust</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Absolutely. I don't approve of doing any real physical damage and a kid should only  <br>
get a few whacks in extreme circumstances when everything else has failed. And, as I <br>
said, I have no problem with parents who don't believe in corporal punishment under <br>
any circumstances. However, I do believe there always should be serious consequences <br>
for serious bad actions. Parents who let their kids practically commit murder and <br>
then shrug it off drive me nuts.<br>
