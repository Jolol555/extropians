SPACECRAFT DETECTS LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER ICE ON MOON<br>
By Warren E. Leary<br>
New York Times, March 6, 1998<br>
<p>
Washington -- An American spacecraft has found evidence that<br>
relatively large amounts of frozen water exist on the Moon, scattered<br>
in craters over vast spans of the north and south poles, scientists<br>
announced Thursday.  Rather than being an entirely dry wasteland, the<br>
scientists said, the Moon may have enough water, in the form of small<br>
ice crystals mixed in loose dirt, to sustain lunar colonies and<br>
provide fuel for rockets exploring the solar system.  The<br>
preliminary findings from the Lunar Prospector spacecraft, launched<br>
on Jan. 7 to study the composition of the Moon, inspired excited<br>
scientists to speculate about returning humans there after a<br>
quarter-century absence.<br>
<p>
'We have found water,' said the mission's principal scientist, Dr.<br>
Alan Binder of the Lunar Research Institute in Gilroy, Calif. <br>
Binder said the orbiting spacecraft's measurements of atomic<br>
particles escaping from the Moon were the 'first unquestionable<br>
results' showing water at both lunar poles.  In 1996, a Defense <br>
Department craft called Clementine was diverted to the Moon and <br>
bounced radar signals off the surface that suggested deposits of <br>
water ice lay in deep craters near the south pole.  Researchers <br>
working with Clementine said they thought they had found ice but were <br>
not positive.  Their interpretation of radar signals indicated that <br>
110 million tons to 1.1 billion tons of water ice could be contained <br>
in an area of up to 5,500 square miles.<br>
<p>
Preliminary estimates of Lunar Prospector data suggest that there are <br>
11 million tons to 330 million tons water ice in sun-shielded craters <br>
scattered over as much as 25,000 square miles of lunar surface, <br>
scientists said.  The new results also suggest that there is water <br>
ice on both poles, they said, and almost twice as much at the north <br>
pole as at the south.  Dr. William Feldman, a co-investigator from <br>
Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, said data from the <br>
spacecraft's neutron spectrometer instrument 'are consistent with the <br>
presence of water ice in very low concentrations across a significant <br>
number of craters.'  In areas where water ice is found, it appears to <br>
make up only 0.3 percent to 1 percent of the Moon's rocky soil, known <br>
as regolith, the scientists said at a news conference at the Ames <br>
Research Center, a NASA field installation near Mountain View, Calif. <br>
Still, they said, scattered over such a wide area, this could <br>
represent 2.6 billion to 26 billion gallons of water.  NASA noted <br>
that a typical person uses 100 gallons of water daily for drinking, <br>
food preparation, bathing and washing. &lt;snip&gt;<br>
