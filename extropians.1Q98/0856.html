<i>&gt; appear to be much longer lived than the pro-technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; ones.</i><br>
<p>
This seems to be because of the shape of the subjective utility<br>
function and the way people deal with risks; we seem to regard threats<br>
as more dangerous than equivalent rewards, and evaluate more dramatic<br>
disasters as more likely than they really are. So the subjective<br>
effect of listing a long list of benefits of something and adding one,<br>
very unlikely but spectacular risk is to make people concentrate on<br>
the risk, and after a while they will remember mainly the risk. Silly?<br>
Yes - but that is human cognitive psychology for you.<br>
<p>
What to do about it (beside rewiring our cognitive structure at the<br>
earliest opportunity)? One possibility is to create counter-images for<br>
the disaster scenarios, just as vivid and showing clearly why they are<br>
not valid. For example, the image of a dictator cloning an army can be<br>
counter-imaged by pointing out that the dictator will have to wait<br>
around 18 years for the babies to grow up - and few dictators want to<br>
have an army in two decades, when they usually need it today. In<br>
short, we should work to defuse the irrational disaster scenarios by<br>
showing how they can be avoided or why they are so silly. Of course we<br>
need good arguments for our positions too, but when it comes to<br>
dealing with downright propaganda techniques like this are handy.<br>
