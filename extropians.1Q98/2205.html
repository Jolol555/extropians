If you have felt lately that the world was just moving 'too fast'<br>
for you, you have company throughout the universe, according to the<br>
High-z Supernova Search team, which reported a set of startling<br>
measurements in today's _Science_ journal (for information on this<br>
journal, see below)  The team, working with Serl Perlmutter of the<br>
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Brian Schmidt of the Mount<br>
Stromlo, Alex Filippenko of the University of California, and<br>
astronomers on the three largest continents, have been tracking<br>
variations in the brightness of distant supernovae as they travel<br>
further from Earth.  They utilized the Hubble telescope and<br>
observatories in Chile, Australia and Hawaii to conduct their<br>
observations, and their measurements show an accelerated rate of<br>
dimming, leading them to believe that the rate of expansion of the<br>
universe has actually increased since its inception.  Of course, to<br>
account for an increase in the speed of expansion, a force must<br>
counteract gravity, and the team has proposed that a countervailing<br>
force that they are calling 'antigravity'.  They stressed in a press<br>
interview this morning that by the term 'antigravity' they do not<br>
mean a force in exact opposition to gravity, but rather a force that<br>
counteracts the effects of gravity.  <br>
