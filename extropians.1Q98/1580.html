<i>&gt; I'm a newbie to this list, and have a lot of reading to do.</i><br>

Welcome!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm looking for a lay working group, of bio-medical engineers and</i><br>
<i>&gt; practical theorists, to discuss the current state of the art in</i><br>
<i>&gt; artificial organ development, and to be a springboard for new ideas.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with the recent comments by Natasha Vita More, this group=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; if full of highly intelligent people all going down their own paths</i><br>
<i>&gt; with zeal.  Surely, practical (and marketable) ideas can find their</i><br>
<i>&gt; birth here.</i><br>
<p>
Artificial organs are a fast-approaching technology.  Biologists have<br>
found ways to induce cells to grow on artificial substrates so that they<br>
can control their shape and many of their characteristics.  I don't<br>
think we'll see artificially grown hearts for a while, but artificial<br>
skin and other connective tissues are under heavy development.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sociologically humanity will accept and embrace small steps where</i><br>
<i>&gt; large ones would be feared.  Should I come from the operating room</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a Borg, I fully expect to be stoned to death on a street corner.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If I instead, get a second or third heart, no one will care.  If I</i><br>
<i>&gt; get an artificial gill tucked neatly inside my Henley, no one will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be the wiser.</i><br>
<p>
One of the stories on the extropian reading list is Marc Stiegler's<br>
"The Gentle Seduction", which explores this theme.  People reject the<br>
wild dreams of technophiles like ourselves, but when presented in small<br>
steps, each one seems reasonable.  James Halperin's new novel _The<br>
First Immortal_ has some similar ideas.<br>
<p>
Somewhere I have a machine readable version of Stiegler's story, so it<br>
must have been online at one time, but I can't find it now.<br>
