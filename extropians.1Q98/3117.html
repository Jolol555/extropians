Kick Graybull:<br>
<i>&gt;Sorry, but English inherited *none* of its grammatical structure from</i><br>
<i>&gt;either Latin or Greek, &lt;snip&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, but I took three solid years of linguistic and grammatic <br>
theory at university, and I doubt that our professors and our <br>
textbooks were making up facts.  Up until partway through 16c English <br>
relied upon Germanic grammatical structures until a few <br>
cultural heavyweights on the British islands decided that enlightened <br>
and civilized humans spoke Latin, and therefore set up new <br>
grammatical rules for English that relied upon Latin grammatical <br>
structures, with some vestiges of German.  In modern form, much of <br>
the tripartite gender structure has fallen away.  We tend not to <br>
consider objects as having any sort of gender.<br>
<p>
As for references, any good English dictionary gives the period in<br>
which a word entered the language, and many dictionaries base that<br>
information on the OED.  As I look up the word 'man', I discover<br>
that the entymology has a break in it (ME, from OE, akin to OHG),<br>
meaning that it fell out of use in Old English and was revived into<br>
the language in the Middle English period.  My Shakespeare and <br>
Chaucer concordances indicate a variety of meanings in use at the <br>
time, not just the one.<br>
