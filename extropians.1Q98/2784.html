<i>&gt; &gt;&lt;ANTIRANT&gt;My Libertarian views are not reactionary, at least not now,</i><br>

<i>&gt; They</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, the nazis approved something *they* called assisted suicide. It was</i><br>
<i>&gt; called Euthanasia.</i><br>
<p>
and it was hardly voluntary. I would hardly call the way your socialist buddies<br>
in china harvest organs from prisoners as 'assisted suicide' either.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are different conservative groups. One is the religous-right,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Republican group. You're hardly part of that group. But there's also a group</i><br>
<i>&gt; of technology freaks that argue based on ideas that were refuted a long time</i><br>
<i>&gt; ago. I call this conservative. You call it Extropy.</i><br>
<p>
You should look at the political arena as more of an x/y coordinate system,<br>
rather than just a right left spectrum. One axis represents relative social<br>
freedom, and the other represents relative economic freedom. While American<br>
conservatives occupy the high economic,low social freedom corner, and nazis and<br>
communists occupy the low economic, low social freedom corner, libertarians<br>
occupy the high, high corner, while the international anarchists typically are<br>
in the high social, low economic corner.<br>
<p>
Categorizing me in with religiouys conservatives is as insulting as puttin an<br>
anarchist in with Stalin. Please be more discrete in your definitions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Not a bad analogy, but possibly more renaissance, depending on what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;characteristics of the middle ages you are referring to. If you are talking</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;about free enterprise, low tax, self reliant, spirit of exploration and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;adventure, then I wont argue.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Spirit of exploration and adventure. ROTFL. A good way to describe the</i><br>
<i>&gt; crusades in an advertising of the vatican.</i><br>
<p>
A good way to describe the age of exploration, or of the Viking era. My own<br>
family lived in Nova Scotia prior to Jamestown and the Mayflower, at least part<br>
of the year.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;To a transhuman, the sum of the self extends beyond the mere flesh body.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and Material tools and resources are merely extensions of the self. As</i><br>
<i>&gt; property</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;defines ones resources, property defines the self of a transhuman.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;was developed in order to more easily expand the size and utility of ones</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;property.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't disagree with this. I disagree, however, with the assumption that</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun ownership and protection of non-transhuman property with deadly force is</i><br>
<i>&gt; even worth discussing. I also disagree that natural selection applies to</i><br>
<i>&gt; cultural evolution.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree, as the idea that the state has the right to use deadly force in<br>
redistributing my property which they confiscate from me without due process or<br>
proper Constitutional authority is not even worth discussing.<br>
<p>
And what is "non-transhumanist property" anyways? Just what you define it as, or<br>
the state? Property is property. Whether it is "non-transhumanist" or not is<br>
merely due to whether it is in the hands of a transhumanist or not. Nobody else<br>
has the authority to decide otherwise.<br>
<p>
Really, funny, the native Americans might have something to say about the idea<br>
that natural selection doesn't apply to cultural evolution, especially the dead<br>
ones. So might the Nazis, the Communists, and today, the French, as their<br>
uncompetetive little culture is getting overrun by Americanization (as most<br>
other undynamic cultures are today). As tacky as you might think it is, the<br>
current American Culture seems to presently be the most competetive culture in<br>
current existence (Or North American culture, as a Canadian would say ;)). Of<br>
course that could change, and if it does, we could all be eating tofu.....<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Sure, which is why I enjoy playing with my new rifle, or my new fly rod, up</i><br>
<i>&gt; at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the family cabin in the North Country, driving my red Jeep Cherokee 4.0</i><br>
<i>&gt; liter</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;4x4 to get there, or just staying in town for the weekend and shooting a</i><br>
<i>&gt; few</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;rounds of skeet, or going skiing. When I'm home, I like to play on my PC</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;equipped with an Intel P II 233 with 64MRAM, 4.8G of hard drive space, 6x</i><br>
<i>&gt; CD rom</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and 2x/4x CD writer, 4800dpi 24 bit color flatbed scanner, HP color</i><br>
<i>&gt; printer, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with my Casio digital camera. I can't decide, though, what to buy this</i><br>
<i>&gt; summer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;though, either an ultralight plane, or a share in an oil well in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Louisiana....</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;decisions, decisions, decision.....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; All play and no work make Mike a spoiled brat :-). By playing, I don't mean</i><br>
<i>&gt; this kind of entertainment (I won't even comment on your rifle mania). I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking about playing with ideas, concepts, perception. You can do this with</i><br>
<i>&gt; an Apple II. Or even with a pencil and a sheet of paper. Your Pentium II is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not yet connected to your brain. Using your own brain is therefore more</i><br>
<i>&gt; effective than using this "extension".</i><br>
<p>
Depends. Check out my new art exhibit when it comes out.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; This</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; planet could live much better with such 'forward thinkers'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Why thank you very much.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You're welcome. You know my position on the economic problems of today's</i><br>
<i>&gt; society.</i><br>
<p>
And as off base as I think you are, you're still a nice guy.<br>
