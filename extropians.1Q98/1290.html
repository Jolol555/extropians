  IAN: Well, hemp will grow in the worst soils, <br>
  and it will even raise the level of nitrogen.<br>
  Hemp seed is second only to the soy bean in<br>
  protein, and unlike the soy bean is not known<br>
  to be an allergen. Hemp seed oil is also high<br>
  in the varieties of fat that increase the<br>
  good cholesterol and decrease the bad, LDL.<br>
<p>
  As I understand, it takes 9 pounds of gain <br>
  consumed by a cow to yield one pound of meat.<br>
  Of course the meat may have a higher concen-<br>
  tration of protein than most grains, yet soy<br>
  and hemp are sufficiently protein rich to <br>
  meet and exceed human protein needs. <br>

  I did a report back in high school calculating<br>
  how much more food we would have if the food <br>
  that livestock ate was not devoted to feeding<br>
  animals born to be killed for human consumption.<br>
  I'd have to dig up that report to get the exact <br>
  numbers, but I recall that the amount of food <br>
  in the world would increase about 4X or more.<br>
  If I recall, almost 70% of grains grown go to <br>
  the feeding of livestock to support the <br>
  system of meat-eating mass murder.<br>
<p>
  I've been a vegetarian for 19 years without <br>
  any health related problems, and probably <br>
  many health related benefits, although it's<br>
  impossible to determine the bad health you've<br>
  avoided since you cannot be both the subject <br>
  and the control of your own experiment. But<br>
  studies suggest that a vegetarian diet is<br>
  far healthier than nonvegatarian diets.<br>
  And anything that is more healty and<br>
  more ethical is more extropian.<br>
