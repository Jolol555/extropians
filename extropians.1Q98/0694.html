This is a letter to the editor I plan to send to my local paper<br>
(Sacramento, CA) and a few other places (including the Pres.<br>
himself, of course), and to place on my web site.  It is, like<br>
all of my work, in the public domain, and I encourage everyone<br>
to disseminate it as widely as possible, or edit and paraphrase<br>
it to your liking, in the hope that some papers will have the<br>
courage to print it.  Perhaps some will even read and understand it.<br>

President Clinton and the Age of Ignorance<br>
<p>
On May 25, 1961, President Kennedy called on the American<br>
people to work toward the goal of landing a man on the moon,<br>
expressing his hope that the nation would "move forward, with<br>
the full speed of freedom, in the exciting adventure of space."<br>
The age of discovery that followed his visionary goal saw not<br>
only the moon landing itself but a cornucopia of advances in<br>
science and industry that were side-effects of space research.<br>
Diets improved, diseases were cured, cars and airplanes became<br>
safer and cleaner, communication became faster and more<br>
universal, and "space age" became the preferred description for<br>
anything new and modern that made life better.<br>
<p>
On January 10, 1997, President Clinton called on Congress to<br>
ban the use of cloning technology on humans; the age of<br>
discovery is now in danger of becoming the age of ignorance<br>
and fear.  With science on the edge of discoveries in<br>
biotechnology that promise to improve our diets, cure and<br>
prevent disease, clean the environment, give hope to infertile<br>
parents, and make life better in a thousand ways no one could<br>
possibly predict, Clinton has allowed the irrational fears of<br>
the Religious Right and the Luddite Left to put the brakes on<br>
this exciting adventure before it has even begun.<br>
<p>
Fear of the unknown is no excuse.  Much more is known now about<br>
cloning--the form of reproduction used by most species on our<br>
planet--than was known about space in 1961.  Identical twins<br>
have been studied for decades.  Anyone who thinks a cloned child<br>
is any different from a perfectly normal human baby is letting<br>
bad science fiction stories cloud his understanding.<br>
<p>
Clinton justifies his stance by saying that "scientific<br>
advancement should not take place in a moral vacuum."  I<br>
wholeheartedly agree.  It would be morally wrong for the<br>
scientific community to stand idle and let the legislature<br>
stifle research that could save thousands of lives.  It would<br>
be morally wrong to tell two parents who carry a genetic disease<br>
that they must abandon hope of having a child instead of using<br>
a safe technique of science to bear a healthy, natural child of<br>
their own without risk.<br>
<p>
Morality and reason must be partners, not enemies.  If there are<br>
dangers in the technology, we will find them by research, not by<br>
wild speculation.  Shutting down reasearch will close off a new<br>
generation from the benefits of this technology--and the possible<br>
benefits are well known and too many to list here.  The possible<br>
dangers are in mostly in the imagination of the uneducated.  But<br>
even if the benefits were not well known, the research itself will<br>
create new discoveries and opportunities the way space research<br>
did in the past four decades.  I call on the American people, and<br>
Congress, and the President, to look forward to a new age of<br>
discovery in biosience, and all the miracles that it could bring.<br>
I call on the scientific community to educate the people with<br>
greater emphasis on real-life applications.  Let us all move<br>
forward with the full speed of freedom toward better lives.<br>
