I assume you're talking Dutch banks; British banks made many hideously<br>

Of course they do; they want all the payback with no risk. But that's not<br>
how the world works. You think a Singularity will be stable and predictable?<br>

<p>
Are they rioting in LA again, or are you talking about the last big<br>
riots? Either way, if your only argument for welfare programs is that if<br>
we don't pay off the poor they'll beat us up, then you're getting into<br>
incredibly dangerous territory. You say that the costs of rioting might<br>
be lower if the rich paid them off... the rich could just as well say<br>
that the cost of rioting would be much lower if they just shot the<br>
rioters on sight; absent gun control laws you could pick up a used<br>
machinegun and a couple of thousand rounds for much less than a year's<br>
welfare tax payments.<br>

<p>
Immortality *is* one of those 'other nice goodies'. Poor societies don't<br>
develop immortality. Stable, predictable societies don't develop immortality.<br>
Only unstable, unpredictable, rich societies do.<br>
<p>
Anyway, as the Year-2000 bug looks set to take down the IRS in the next<br>
couple of years (along with numerous other federal and state agencies) <br>
the question of welfare in America is probably moot.<br>
