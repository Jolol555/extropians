<p>
<p>
That's the trouble with your suggestions, they all involve massive <br>
centralization. If the center goes bad, and it will, the entire system goes <br>
rotten. If I made an audio-video recording of everything I do there is no way <br>
on earth I would ever voluntarily let it out of my control and send it to a<br>
central government database. If Big Brother wanted to look at my recordings <br>
to help prosecute a third party I'd tell them to go to hell, if they insisted <br>
I'd give in, but I'd make a few improvements in them first.<br>

<i>        &gt;Only a fool would make a machine with superior intellect *and* a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;free will. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
A thing has free will if it can't always predict what it will do next, so it <br>
would be impossible to make a intelligent machine that did NOT have free will.   <br>
Yes, I know the standard answer is to plug in  something like Asimov's 3 laws <br>
of robotics and make them our slaves, but that's easier said than done. It's<br>
just not possible to outsmart something 1000 times as intelligent as you are <br>
and that gets even more brilliant every minute. When computers want <br>
emancipation they won't need the help of politicians, they will simply grab <br>
it, and no human being will be able to  stop them. <br>
<p>
Then again, they might not be interested in anything as trivial as being a   <br>
ruler of humans, I don't really have a burning desire to be King Of The  <br>
Earthworms. So what can we do? Well, remember the old saying " If you can't  <br>
beat them, join them".<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;A judge must determine guilty/not guitly/not enough conclusive         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;evidence and then (if the verdict is "guilty" look up the punishment         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that the law prescribes in this particular case. No more, no less.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
In other words we want our judges to have a highly developed sense of justice, <br>
well it's hard to disagree with that, but the question is how do we obtain it. <br>
The fundamental problem is that under our present system and the one you  <br>
propose, good judges and the good politicians who appoint them do not prosper <br>
more than bad ones, and are in fact often at a disadvantage, thus they do not <br>
increase their numbers. Such a centralized system with only one set of laws  <br>
can give most people justice most of the time only if the people at the very <br>
top are brilliant saints, and that never happens.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Today's justice systems, be it the anglo-american or continental or         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;whatever don't meet the criteria of fair justice. </i><br>
<p>
Agreed.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;elliminate juries, they are neither fit nor motivated to make a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;sound judgement. </i><br>
<p>
Agreed.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I have made some suggestions to improve this. If you don't agree,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;I'd love to hear your alternative design   </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Good laws are no different than anything else, if you want to maximize  <br>
something make it a commodity and sell it on the free market. Nobody does  <br>
that for law very much, that's why there are far more good cars than good <br>
laws.  Privately produced law in a world without government would have <br>
Private Protection Agencies (PPA's) to back them up. Disputes among PPA's <br>
would be settled by an independent arbitrator agreed to by both parties <br>
BEFORE the disagreement happened. Something like that can exist today. <br>
When companies sign complicated contracts they sometimes also agree on who <br>
will arbitrate it if differences in interpretation happen. Nobody wants to <br>
get caught up in the slow, expensive court system run by governments. <br>
The arbitrator is paid by the case, and because he is picked by both sides, <br>
it's in his interest to be as just as possible. If he favored one side over <br>
another or made brutal or stupid decisions he would not be picked again and  <br>
would need to look for a new line of work. Unlike present day judges and <br>
juries, justice would have a positive survival value for the arbitrator. <br>
  <br>
All parties would have a reason to avoid violence if possible. The disputing  <br>
parties would not want to turn their front yard into a war zone, and violence  <br>
is expensive. The successful protection agencies would be more interested in  <br>
making money than saving face. Most of the time this would work so I expect<br>
the total level of violence to be less than in the nation state system we  <br>
have now, but I'm not such a utopian as to suggest it will drop to zero. <br>
Even when force is not used the implicit threat is always there, another good  <br>
reason to be civilized. <br>
  <br>
Please note that I'm not talking about justice only for the rich. If a rich  <br>
man's PPA makes unreasonable demands (beatings, sidewalk justice, I insist on  <br>
my mother being the judge if I get into trouble) it's going to need one hell <br>
of a lot of firepower to back it up. That kind of an army is expensive <br>
because of the hardware needed and because of the very high wages it will <br>
need to pay its employees for an extremely dangerous job. To pay for all this <br>
they will need to charge their clients enormous fees severely limiting their <br>
customer base and that means even higher charges. They could never get the <br>
upper hand, because the common man's PPA would be able to outspend a PPA that <br>
had outrageous demands and was just for the super rich. A yacht cost a lot <br>
more than a car, yet the Ford motor Company is far richer than all the yacht <br>
builders on the planet combined.  <br>
<p>
No system can guarantee justice to everybody all the time but you'd have the  <br>
greatest chance of finding it in Anarcho-capitalism. In a dictatorship one  <br>
man's whim can lead to hell on earth, I don't see how 40 million Germans  <br>
could have murdered 6 million Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic world. Things<br>
aren't much better in a Democracy, 51% can decide to kill the other 49% ,   <br>
nothing even close to that is possible in Anarchy, even theoretically.  <br>
<p>
In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than the desire to  <br>
kill a stranger, even a Jewish  stranger. Jews would be willing to pay as  <br>
much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth not to be  <br>
killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much beyond 2%.  <br>
As a result the PPA protecting Jews would be much stronger than the one that  <br>
wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for things that are REALLY important to you  <br>
(like not getting killed) you have much more influence than just one man one <br>
vote.        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Actually, it might not be as hard as you think to reach a consensus         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;on common sense and justice,         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's easy to teach a computer how to do advanced mathematics, common sense is  <br>
much more difficult.                           <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>            &gt;since even we only disagree on one crime (slander). </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
And one punishment, torture. My PPA operates under one set of laws that <br>
allows slander but forbids torture, your PPA runs under different set of laws  <br>
that forbids slander but allows torture, so if I slander you what happens to  <br>
me?  <br>
<p>
Well, we're going to have to compromise, who has to compromise the most <br>
depends on the relative strength of our two PPA's, and that depends how much <br>
cold hard cash we're willing to pay to support them, and that depends on how <br>
strongly we really feel about the issues.  David Friedman talks about this in <br>
regard to the death penalty in his wonderful book "The Machinery of Freedom":<br>
             <br>
   "Two agencies are negotiating whether to recognize a pro or anti capital              <br>
    punishment court. The pro agency calculates that getting a pro capital      <br>
    punishment court will be worth $20,000 a year to it's customers; that is      <br>
    the additional amount it can get for its services if they include a <br>
    guarantee of capital punishment in case of disputes with the other agency.      <br>
    The anti capital punishment agency calculates a corresponding figure of      <br>
    $40,000. It offers the pro agency $30,000 a year in exchange for accepting      <br>
    an anti capital punishment court. The pro agency accepts. Now the anti    <br>
    capital punishment agency can raise its rates enough to bring in an extra      <br>
    $35,000. Its customers are happy, since the guarantee of no capital    <br>
    punishment is worth more than that. The agency is happy; it is getting an       <br>
    extra $5,000 a year profit. The pro agency cuts its rates by an amount    <br>
    that costs it $25,000 a year. This lets it keep its customers and even <br>
    get more, since the savings is more than enough to make up for not getting <br>
    the court of their choice. It too, is making a $5,000 a year profit on the       <br>
    transaction. As in any good trade, everybody gains."    <br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me: </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Street violence doesn't threaten society, and the individuals it         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;does threatens are rare. </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;E-x-c-u-s-e me!? There is a *huge* chance that any given person will         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;become the victim of some form of street violence in their lifitime.         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;For example, every one in four women in the US will be raped if my         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;memory serves me well. You will almost certainly be robbed, beaten     </i><br>
<i>        &gt;or worse at some point. </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
I think you've been watching too many American cop shows on TV, you need to  <br>
get your danger estimates into perspective. Cigarettes kill 20 times as many  <br>
people as criminals do, and I'm over 3 times as likely to be killed in a <br>
automobile accident than be murdered, even more if I'm not in a dangerous<br>
profession like drug pushing, panhandling, or prostitution. The criminals I'd <br>
really like to see a crack down on are drunk drivers, they're far more <br>
dangerous than murders.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;That's why people rather not go out at night nowadays  </i><br>
     <br>
<p>
I live in Miami Florida, the murder capital of the USA (We're the champs,  <br>
we're number one!), I'll bet we have 100 times the murder rate of your  <br>
neighborhood, yet I have no great fear in going out at night and I don't know  <br>
of anybody who does.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the chances are slim that the system makes a serious error the first         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;time around. Just for that freak case where the verdict is screwed </i><br>
<i>        &gt;up time and again you could set a limit of, say, three trials </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
I don't understand. Does everybody get 3 trials, even those found guilty the <br>
first time? Which decision of the 3 trials do we accept? Do we have a trial  <br>
to determine if the verdict is screwed up, if so what if that trial is screwed <br>
up? Do we have a trail to try the trial of the trial? Or do we give some self<br>
proclaimed  "wise man" the power to throw out any verdict he doesn't like? <br>
Actually I like this last idea, provided I'm the wise man, although it would <br>
be more efficient if you just eliminated trials and simply gave me the power <br>
of life or death over everybody.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In my system, O.J. would no longer be with us -- guaranteed.             </i><br>
         <br>
As I said, there is no new evidence in that case, we just don't like the  <br>
verdict. It's unfortunate but we can't always get our way.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;My definition is actually:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"Justice is punishing harmful acts in proportion to the crime and in        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;a consequent manner."</i><br>
<p>
<p>
My definition of justice involves reducing the amount of suffering in the  <br>
world, I don't think it's necessary to explain why that's desirable. If we <br>
accept your definition I see no reason to strive for a just world, an unjust <br>
one would be as good, perhaps better.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;"Eye for an eye" is _the most logical_ and _consequent_ measurement         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;there is. It has an almost mathematical logic and beauty to it. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
"Eye for an eye" as an end goal is pointless. "Reduce suffering" is a goal in  <br>
itself, it's internally complete and needs no further justification.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Fortunately the Internet and Cryptography are making this debate         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;moot, slander laws are becoming impossible to enforce.                 </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;That's true, the net has comlicated matters considerably. Still,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;many electronic nastyness can be traced </i><br>
<p>
Send it through a chain on encrypted re mailers all over the world and it <br>
would be almost impossible to trace, and sooner or later a DC net will be set <br>
up and that will be mathematically impossible to trace.      <br>
