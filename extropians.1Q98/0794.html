Yes, but my point, in some post, was that whole-body levels of<br>
telomerase are probably already close to optimal.  If the gains<br>
from increasing telomerase exceeded the risks, evolution would<br>
already have cranked it up.  In order to get big gains from<br>
toying with telomerase, we will probably have to use it with more <br>
precision than evolution can usually manage.<br>
<p>
A whole-body activation of a cancer-limiter is dangerous in the <br>
extreme.<br>
<p>
Also, although genetic manipulation of removed cells is expensive,<br>
we can usually get a few cells successfully manipulated.  Thanks<br>
to the glories of exponential growth that may be all that's <br>
required.  If rejuvenation also increases response to growth<br>
factors (probable) then just a few skin cells could eventually<br>
replace a whole skin via faster reproduction.  <br>
