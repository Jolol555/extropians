<i>&gt; &gt; [quoting someone]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A draft ("consultation version") of a report by the European Parliament's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Office for Scientific and Technological Option Assessment (STOA) entitled</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "AN APPRAISAL OF TECHNOLOGIES OF POLITICAL CONTROL" has been submitted to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the EuroParl's Civil Liberties and Interior Committee. Several IT-relevant</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; excerpts are now available at John Young's widely respected crypto-politics</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; website: &lt;&lt;<a href="http://www.jya.com/atpc.htm">http://www.jya.com/atpc.htm</a>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "[...] Within Europe, all e-mail, telephone and fax communications are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; routinely intercepted by the United States National Security Agency,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; transferring all target information from the European mainland via the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; strategic hub of London then by satellite to Fort Meade in Maryland via the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; crucial hub at Menwith Hill in the North York Moors of the UK."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This causes my bullshit alarm to ring loudly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1)The bandwidth of "all e-mail, telephone and fax communications" in Europe</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be quite high--higher than any feasible satellite channel.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) Where are the signals intercepted by NSA? nearly all are land-line</i><br>
<i>&gt; only, with no radio component, so physical taps would be necessary. This would</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly require colusion of the European PTTs, which are mostly run by</i><br>
<i>&gt; European governments. Why would they permit NSA to do this?</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) With serious compression, a phone call can be squeezed to an average of</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps 500bytes/sec. There are probably an average of at least one million</i><br>
<i>&gt; simulatneous phone calls in europe at any time. This is 500 megabytes (4 gigabits)</i><br>
<i>&gt; per second, requiring 43.2 terabytes of storage per day. the compression would</i><br>
<i>&gt; require roughly one million very competent DSPs. automatic keyword recognition</i><br>
<i>&gt; equipment would require at least an additional 2 miooion DSPs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I might believe that NSA attempts to intercept as much military microwave voice</i><br>
<i>&gt; as they possibly can in Russia, and that they used to do a lot more of that in</i><br>
<i>&gt; eastern Europe, but modern commercial landlines are a different story entirely.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From what I saw in the story, they have some sort of filter that automatically tags</i><br>
traffic that can be classified as 'target information' that only mentions, say,<br>
certain technologies, or certain groups, or activities, like attacking political<br>
figures, etc..  Having a number of these sort of filter taps in main switching<br>
centers, with forwarding to the mentioned center in England for transmission to the US<br>
is entirely within the known current capability of the NSA. It is already used by US<br>
based law enforcement when the appropriate court orders are issued, and generally for<br>
such threats as that to the president's life. For example, my typing here the phrase<br>
(NOTE TO THE NSA:  this is a test, not a real threat) 'kill the president' will set<br>
off certain triggers in the filters that oversee email traffic. Currently here in the<br>
US, this is done via the FCC. Those of you using Netscape 3.02 will notice when you<br>
send email messages that in the bottom bar of the mail window there will be displayed<br>
a message of the current status of transmission. If you are fast, and you have a<br>
particularly slow computer, you'll notice that a message will flash quickly saying<br>
that your message was posted to the FCC. From what I've seen, the message duplications<br>
go to the FCC for a filtering. Those that contain no 'target information' are tossed.<br>
SInce only messages containing 'target information' is saved, the actual archiving<br>
requirements are far far less than thought by the previous poster, and this operation<br>
could be managed by a few good Alpha servers, maybe a Cray or two.<br>
