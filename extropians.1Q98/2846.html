<i>        &gt;Justice is punishing harmful acts in proportion to the crime and in         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;a consequent manner.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Justice is doing what is needed to prevent harmful acts from being repeated.<br>
<p>
                   <br>
<i>        &gt;Punishments can be fully "customized" and monitored so that no-one        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;is hurt worse than intended. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If you could prove that then I'd have no objection to corporal punishment, <br>
but I don't think it's possible, or at least not  practical.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;if you can't take the heat then *stay out of the kitchen*! No-one         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;is forced to become a violent offender </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
My point is that people should not be punished differently for the trivial <br>
reason of having different physiques, and that nobody should receive the <br>
equivalent of a death sentence for committing a very minor  crime.<br>
                   <br>
                                    <br>
<i>        &gt;Primitive man pesumably acted even more on impulse than we do, and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;feelings of hate and revenge might have helped him on his way to        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the top. </i><br>
<p>
                   <br>
Certainly, but so what? My genes have their agenda and I have mine, besides, <br>
I'm a lot smarter than my genes, even they know that, that's why they gave me <br>
a brain. If you look for wisdom or morality in Evolution you will not find it. <br>
Evolution is brutal and stupid, it has no foresight and can't design worth a <br>
damn, that's why biological creatures are so poorly made.<br>
<p>
                   <br>
<i>        &gt;Vicious slander can ruin someone's reputation for life, and can lead         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to loss ofjob(s), family problems, severe mental damage (sometimes         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;suicide) due to rejection by the community/society etc.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
If your skin is that thin then never say anything controversial, be just like <br>
everybody else, make sure  you don't do anything  creative, don't be too good <br>
at your job and don't make a lot of money, such people are so dull the <br>
tabloids would never dream of slandering them. Nobody is forcing you to <br>
aspire to more and if you can't  take the heat then *stay out of the kitchen*! <br>
<p>
A word about reputation, my reputation is an opinion on the value of my past <br>
actions that's useful in determining the probability that my future actions <br>
will be of value too, but my reputation is not set by me nor is it used by me, <br>
it is used and set by others. This is fortunate because if I could set my<br>
reputation there is no reason I would do so accurately, I would inflate it. <br>
On the other hand it's to your advantage (unless you're a  competitor) to set <br>
my reputation at what it's really worth, set it too high and you'll pay more <br>
for  my services than they're worth, set it too low and you won't hire me <br>
even though I could be of value to you. It's true that a competitor would<br>
want to  set my reputation to a lower value than I should have, but everybody <br>
knows that and takes it into account when he bad mouths me. Nothing is perfect <br>
when you deal with fallible venal human beings, but most people have the <br>
reputation they deserve most of the time, and Big Brother getting into the <br>
act with slander trials is not the reason why.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;People don't really care about the truth, they want dirt </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then these people are fools, and I don't care much if a fool thinks I'm a <br>
fool. If you feel differently and their opinion is that easy to sway then <br>
just sway them back.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;No amount of oral or other defense can fully reverse the effects of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;slander</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Especially if the "slander" is true. If there were an all powerful oracle <br>
that could always tell truth from untruth then it might be a good idea to <br>
stop those who spread ideas that are untrue, and if politicians always knew <br>
how to make the correct decision I'd be in favor of a strong central <br>
government, but pigs can't fly and such oracles are a little hard to find.<br>
