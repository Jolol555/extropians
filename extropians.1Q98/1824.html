Your statement strikes me as naive.  Our understanding of the complex <br>
web of interconnections between food chains is limited at best. It may <br>
turn out that there is no connection.  Howerver, our you willing to risk <br>
your survival on a hunch there is no connection between biodiversity and <br>
the *sustainability* of farming?<br>
<p>
First, the so-called green revolution that we have had over the last 30 <br>
years has come at a cost - the depletion of top soil.  Nitrogen <br>
fertilizers have helped us grow more food, but have also accelerated the <br>
rate at which that same land can't grow again without the introduction <br>
of ever greater and more potent fertilizers.  It doesn't take a genius <br>
to realize that this trend can't continue forever - there is only so <br>
much nitrogen one can add to the soil.  What is missing is the rich and <br>
biodiverse topsoil that must be sustained by adding to the soil exactly <br>
what is taken away (i.e. compost).  Suprisingly very few farmers <br>
actually practice this type of composting.<br>
<p>
Secondly, the use of pesticides is a war that is slowly being lost.  <br>
What is missing is a complex understanding of the *biodiversity* among <br>
the insect community that is essential for the pollination of countless <br>
species of edible plants.  Sustainable farmers have realized this and <br>
have taken great measures to eliminate pesticides; and instead foster <br>
the growth of certain populatons of insects who are vital to either <br>
pollination or as predators to those insects who find the crops <br>
delicious.<br>
<p>
My point is this:  the connections between most species we have studied <br>
are sublte yet profound (i.e. if one species goes, so do others.)  I do <br>
not know of any connection between say a peruvian beatle and the human <br>
community.  But my ignorance of this, is no reason to gamble on their <br>
not being one.  As an extropian I want to expand myself *indefinitley*.  <br>
So until I have a better undertanding of the complex web of <br>
interconnections that is this bioshpere, I am not going to rush out and <br>
kill some species that may turn out to be essential later for my long <br>
term survival.<br>
<p>
Besides, the destructiion of biodiversity is not a very extropian thing <br>
to do as it is a net decrease in overall complexity.  Isn't extropianism <br>
about increasing complexity?<br>
