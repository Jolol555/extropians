Mark Crosby wrote 3/8/98: &lt;Cariani explains: "Digital systems are useful<br>
for high degrees of reliability and combinatoric multiplication of states;<br>
analog systems are useful for retaining the richness of perceptual inputs,<br>
in keeping around all those aspects of the sensed world that might not be<br>
readily relevant, but which could become so".&gt;<br>
<p>
There is a large and growing body of scientific research on tacit<br>
perception and tacit knowledge that support this quite well.<br>
<p>
MC: &lt;I conclude that a cognitive science for intelligent technologies needs<br>
such a biosemiotic framework if it is to keep from wandering in<br>
hermeneutical circles!&gt;<br>
<p>
I share your conclusion.  It needs other things in addition, but this is<br>
useful.<br>
<p>
MC: &lt;I see, not an abstract population being drawn and quartered by<br>
polarities but, instead, a *natural-historic* host of individuals enacting<br>
this drama under some 'global laws', but mostly 'local rules',<br>
autopoietically self-maintaining the potentialities in an unpredictable but<br>
robust and ongoing, middle-out way (also known as the Tao).&gt;<br>
<p>
Predictions, like biological theories, are if-then in nature.  If the trend<br>
line continues, then blah, blah, blah...  I do not see the global culture<br>
of death prevailing in the long run, I believe the forces of the culture of<br>
life, which, as you allude to, tend to be particularistic, will prevail.  I<br>
am dynamically optimistic, but this does not mean they will prevail without<br>
a nasty fight.  Entropy never goes away, nor does nihilism nor does<br>
tyranny.  The fight is forever.  The Tao is squarely within the liquid<br>
realm of polycentric political structures.  As long as we keep recentering<br>
here when we drift to the ordered realm or the chaotic realm, we'll be<br>
fine.  "Natural-historic host of individuals enacting this drama under some<br>
global law" sounds like Hegel's "cunning of reason," life evolving "at the<br>
edge of chaos."  We must be active, we cannot all fall asleep and hope the<br>
laws will bail us out, they won't.<br>
