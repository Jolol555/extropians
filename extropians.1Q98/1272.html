The human body is really not designed to process a lot of meat with the <br>
high level of fat common in modern farm animals. The wild meat the <br>
cavemen were eating is nothing like the fat laden stuff you see in your <br>
local supermarket. It's pretty well established that a high fat diet is <br>
not good for you. Yes, there are bad high fat vegetarian foods, but <br>
limiting (or eliminating) your meat intake and eating low fat vegetarian <br>
fare seems to be a healthy way to go.<br>
<p>
Frankly, I do not care what anyone on this list eats, but you do not <br>
need to eat meat.<br>
<p>
However, I would question the idea (expressed by Max More) that we would <br>
have more food on the market if we didn't eat meat. There are three main <br>
reasons some people do not have enough to eat:<br>
 <br>
1. They don't have money to buy food<br>
2. Political interference in agricultural production. <br>
3. War.<br>
<p>
My food buying habits will change none of these factors. Just because I <br>
stop eating meat, it does not follow that more grain will now go to feed <br>
a starving child in Africa. Almost certainly, total grain production <br>
would just decrease in response to decreased demand. <br>
