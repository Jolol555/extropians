I'm presuposing a new ICF fusion reactor based on starting at extreme<br>

That a fission system. While I feel that traditional fission systems are<br>
safer for the environment than any current alternative, I'm not willing<br>
to argue the point. It's irrelevant to "mister fusion."<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; recovery of the dangerous isotopes generated by neutron activation, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; all that remains is deactivation of those same isotopes. This is also</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; fast neutrons by recycling them back into the fusion reactor. Most of</i><br>

<i>&gt; This is a feature I also do not like about planned fusion tritium</i><br>

<i>&gt; be relatively low, the wall radiation load will be quite demanding. We</i><br>
<i>&gt; have already miles and miles of tritium-contaminated liquid lithium pipes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; now we must also intertwine them with hot waste ducts. I do not see how</i><br>
<i>&gt; this will limit the total waste curie output.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I concur. So do most nuclear engineers, but they don't talk about it<br>
much. the public still believes fusion is clean, and the engineers<br>
know that fusion (and fission) are a whole lot cleaner than fossil<br>
fuels, so the engineers try to avoid tainting fusion with the<br>
irrationality<br>
associated with radioactivity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; atoms will eventually transform to stable isotopes under additional</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; exposure to fast neutrons. The tiny percentage that do not can be</i><br>

<i>&gt; and increases the yield. It is difficult to see how dirt cheap but precise</i><br>
<i>&gt; macroscopic structures could make such a big difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
But "cheaper" and "yield" are the two main points. "Cheaper" makes a<br>
concept econimically feasible. "high yield" means you can eliminate<br>
essentially all the waste.<br>

<i>&gt; significantly. Novel acceleration principles do not rely on nanotech for</i><br>
<i>&gt; implementation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
No, but nanotech should permit extreme precision. This generally permits<br>
extreme efficiency, which may permit significant size reduction.<br>
