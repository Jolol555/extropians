<p>
 No. I think the injunction "don't write to a file without permission of<br>
its owner" is less abstract, and most rights that will be important to<br>
uploaded beings can be built out of such injunctions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;  I don't agree that power/knowledge-assymmetries neccesarily makes shared</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; rights unreliable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do you agree that an historical case can be made for the claim that</i><br>
<i>&gt;massive power/knowledge assymmetries often *have* permitted or even</i><br>
<i>&gt;encouraged systems of rights to perform less reliably?</i><br>
<p>
 Yes, this is what makes this discussion important. Some systems of rights<br>
magnify this problem, others deter it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think mutual respect for property rights is a kind</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of right which, once firmly established, essentially all participants have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; an incentive to defend the system, and adding mechanisms to discriminate</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; between entities that want to use it would detract from the system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Isn't the problem that what will constitute "respect for property rights"</i><br>
<i>&gt;(think of state "takings" or urban squatting, etc) is always open to </i><br>
<i>&gt;interpretation, and in the face of the kinds of *massive* power/knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt;assymmetries we're talking about when we're talking of Power/mehuman</i><br>
<i>&gt;"relations", it's a safe bet just whose "interpretations" will stick.</i><br>
<p>
 No, one point I was trying to make when I referred you to the Agorics<br>
papers is that the ambiguities that cause such disputes can be avoided<br>
if the adjudication method consists of software. The Unix filesystem is<br>
an example of a system of property rights which is not open to differing<br>
interpretations (at least as long as only one person has the password to<br>
each account).<br>
 For other ways of seeing the same point, read Nick Szabo's smart contracts<br>
paper or Mark Miller's Extro 3 talk Computer Security as the Future of Law.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not to suggest that there aren't obvious differences in play here, but I</i><br>
<i>&gt;scarcely imagine you feel the diversity of your diet is challenged by a</i><br>
<i>&gt;refusal of cannibalism?</i><br>
<p>
 It seems pretty obvious to me that my diet would be less diverse,<br>
although that wouldn't be much of a challenge.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I don't see how valuing diversity implies giving plants a different </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; status than animals. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Part of valuing diversity is respecting sentience and the forms it takes</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the world.  That animals are sentient and plants are not is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;difference in status that isn't exactly arbitrary to take note of, surely? </i><br>
<p>
 It's not arbitrary, but I don't see how it's relevant to diversity.<br>
I gather you use "diversity" to mean something more than I do. I'm<br>
trying to use the standard definition I got from ecology textbooks<br>
back in the 70's when I studied that kind of thing, which is roughly<br>
"no single species occupies a large fraction of the available space"<br>
(for many meanings of species, including "people with memeset X").<br>
What do you mean by "diversity"?<br>
