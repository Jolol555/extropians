<p>
As stated before, I'm not an economist, but I wonder if growth solely<br>
related to private investments? Or is the businees 'environment' also a<br>
factor? The educational level of employees, infrastructure, strikes (or<br>
lack thereof). All these have no influance?<br>
<p>
I think having some sort of 'support system' increases the stability of a<br>
society because there's no 'underclass' that has nothing to lose. <br>
<p>

<p>
OK, I can find no principal argument against that.<br>
<p>
Then the problem becomes to quantify 'good-in-the-short-run' and<br>
'bad-in-the-long-run'. Is the technical/economic progress gained in 5,10 or<br>
50 years from now worth abandoning welfare now and letting a part of the<br>
population slide down to extreme poverty, disease (or maybe starvation)?<br>
<p>
Can we attach numbers to these values somehow? So how much technical<br>
progress is a human life or human suffering worth these days?<br>
<p>
Dan, I think you have cut to the core of the discussion, thanks.<br>
