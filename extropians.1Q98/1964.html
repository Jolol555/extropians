<i>&gt; While I agree that the kind of absent-minded foresight exhibited by Tithonus</i><br>

<i>&gt; not so sure.</i><br>
<p>
I just read Poul Anderson's _The Boat of a Million Years_. Highly extropian....very<br>
immortalist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Immortality would:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "be the downfall of religions":  I think this underestimates the concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; religions and the grip they have on the general populace.  Religions do more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than just offer a solace from that "death thing".  Religions give people a way</i><br>
<i>&gt; to get along in an otherwise incompehensible (from their point-of-view)</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe.  In my opinion, religions are also some of the most powerful memes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; existence and "mere" immortality would not spell their end.  It would be more</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting to speculate what the effect immortality would have on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolution of memes.  Immortality might intensify the competition between memes</i><br>
<i>&gt; since they could no longer rely on the historical amnesia of ephemeral humans</i><br>
<i>&gt; to forget problematic pasts.</i><br>
<p>
I would think that successful religious memes in an era of immortality would be<br>
ones of great evangelical fervor, that would look on the world as a physical<br>
culmination of the prophesies of long ago. That we did it ourselves will not matter<br>
(God helps those who help themselves). What will matter will be the seeming<br>
establishment of the long promised New Jerusalem. Once Lamarkian memetic<br>
propagation becomes the predominate evolutionary force, people will less and less<br>
beleive in the 'obsolescent' theory of darwinian evolution. (If its not on TV, it<br>
ain't true). Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "allow humans to achieve higher levels of understanding of the universe around</i><br>
<i>&gt; them":  I'm not sure about this one either.  Aged people are not necessarily</i><br>
<i>&gt; more enlightened than younger people.  Most revolutionary concepts are born in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the minds of the young not the old.  Older people are considered "wiser" but</i><br>
<i>&gt; not necessarily "enlightened".</i><br>
<p>
But if people are young in mind and body forever, or at least for a much longer<br>
period, would they not retain this youthfull imagination and enlightened viewpoint?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not a memory expert but without memory augmentation, immortality might not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a big advantage.  To the extent that our memories and experiences (to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; extent we can recall them) represent who we are and how we relate to our</i><br>
<i>&gt; external surroundings, immortality would only benefit it us to the extent that</i><br>
<i>&gt; it allowed people to utilize the memory capacity of the brain to its maximum.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Additionally, old people are generally rigid in their beliefs and outlooks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps they've tried lots of lifestyles but eventually they settle on a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; beliefs and they become very set in their ways.  Imagine trying to change the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind of a 400 year old codger.</i><br>
<p>
Rather than looking at that 400 year old as a wrinkly shriveled codger, imagine<br>
someone who looks 25 but is actually 400 years old.<br>
