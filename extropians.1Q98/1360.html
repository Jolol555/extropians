This is incorrect for approximately 90% of the population.  Your<br>
liver synthesizes about 1 gm/day of cholesterol and downregulates<br>
production based on consumption: eat 200 mg/day more, it makes<br>
200 mg/day less.  For this 90%, cholesterol consumption has no<br>
effect on cholesterol levels.  What does affect cholesterol is <br>
fat and calories.  Many cholesterol-high foods are also high in<br>
fat and calories as well (e.g. eggs) so they do indeed raise<br>
cholesterol; this confounding correlation is part of the reason<br>
many think that consumed cholesterol makes a big difference for<br>
blood cholesterol.<br>
<p>
I eat meat, and my cholesterol level is 135.  My family history<br>
for heart disease is absolutely hideous, with three of four <br>
grandparents dying of atherosclerosis and both parents having<br>
highly elevated cholesterol.  I get this with a low-fat diet<br>
and fairly casual CR.  You can get a great cholesterol level<br>
on animal products.<br>
