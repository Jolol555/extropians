I am not the person duplicating postings on this list.  I was merely<br>
commenting upon the same duplicate postings that you commented about<br>
earlier.  I do not have my reader set to send duplicates back to myself<br>
or anybody else.  You are diagnosing a problem in my software that I am<br>
not having.<br>
<p>
But, I can see how your scenario would cause duplicate postings. <br>
Anybody with their mailer set up in the manner you describe would indeed<br>
send duplicate postings to the list.  I had not thought of your<br>
scenario, and it certainly could explain some of the duplicates.  I am<br>
describing a second and entirely different scenario.  This second<br>
scenario is definitely happening for some of the duplicates I have been<br>
seeing.  There may be multiple possible causes for duplicate postings.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the reason why this is happening is NOT because you are responding to all</i><br>
participants,<br>
<p>
Selecting "Reply-To-All" to a posting sent through<br>
"extropians@extropy.ORG" will definitely result in duplicate postings.<br>
Selecting "Reply-To-All" to a posting sent to "extropians@extropy.COM"<br>
will not result in duplicate postings.<br>
<p>
Instead of questioning, here is how to test it for yourself:<br>
<p>
To confirm duplicate postings through extropians@extropy.ORG:<br>
1.  Send e-mail to extropians@extropy.ORG<br>
2.  Your e-mail should have "To: extropians@extropy.ORG", just one<br>
address<br>
2.  The List software will add a header "Reply-To:<br>
extropians@extropy.COM", adding the second address<br>
4.  All participants on the list will see a single posting with headers<br>
referencing both e-mail addresses for this list<br>
5.  Do a "Reply-to-All" on this posting, and you should reply to BOTH<br>
addresses<br>
6.  Your e-mailer should say "To: extropians@extropy.ORG,<br>
extropians@extropy.COM"<br>
7.  The list software will receive e-mail to each address<br>
8.  The list software forwards both of these addresses to the same List<br>
9.  All participants on the list will see two postings, one "To:<br>
extropians@extropy.ORG" and one "To: extropians@extropy.COM"<br>
10. Flame war about duplicate postings starts<br>
<p>
To confirm nonduplicate postings through extropians@extropy.COM:<br>
1.  Send e-mail to extropians@extropy.COM<br>
2.  Your e-mail should have "To: extropians@extropy.COM", just one<br>
address<br>
2.  The List software will add a header "Reply-To:<br>
extropians@extropy.COM", using the same address<br>
4.  All participants on the list will see a single posting with headers<br>
referencing only one e-mail addresses for this list<br>
5.  Do a "Reply-to-All" on this posting, and you should reply to the one<br>
and only address<br>
6.  Your e-mailer should say "To: extropians@extropy.COM"<br>
7.  The list software will receive one e-mail at one address<br>
8.  The list software forwards the one e-mail to the List<br>
9.  All participants on the list will see one posting, one "To:<br>
extropians@extropy.COM"<br>
10. Flame war about an unrelated subject starts<br>
