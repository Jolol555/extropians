It, IMHO, seems rather to indicate that since tachnology is non-moral, its<br>
benefit or detriment to society are entirely dependent on what side of 'The<br>
Force' the individual using that technology is on. A machine that can be<br>
reprogrammed by others can be made to do any evil desired. This is what Vader<br>
intimates when he says to Luke earlier, in bot Empire Strikes Back and Return<br>
of the Jedi, "It is too late for me.", as by then he was totally imprisoned by<br>
the machine programming of his android side to remain enslaved to the evil<br>
Emperor Palpatine. Perhaps the severing of his machine hand reduced the<br>
control of the machine side of him long enough for his human side to revolt<br>
and kill the Emperor.<br>
