<i>&gt;...there still is a subjective "I" separate from everything else in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;universe. This separation is what makes it impossible for anyone to ever</i><br>
<i>&gt;produce a valid scientific theory of consciousness, each individual</i><br>
<i>&gt;consciousness is utterly unique and totally inaccessible. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: OK, so you posit that because an identity is<br>
  unique it is separated and not connected to other<br>
  identities. <br>
<p>
No, Ian, that is not what I am positing.  You broke into my quote after my<br>
inherent agreement with you.  My quote began: "I agree with you that the<br>
self, through consciousness, freely roams the universe.  Consciousness may<br>
be a point aspect of the backwards-in-time microcausality from Cramer's<br>
transactional QM interpretation.  However, there still is a subjective "I"<br>
separate from everything else in the universe...."  Spatially, our<br>
consciousness travels every possible backwards-in-time microcausal history,<br>
in so doing, it is one with the local universe (local meaning the universe<br>
as constructed at the Planck scale, not constructions at other scales). <br>
So, no separation spatially in this sense.  Again, however, we do have an<br>
internal subjective unique "I" that is separate from each other and from<br>
external reality.  It is separated and yet connected.  The biggest<br>
connection is through language, Eric Voegelin posits this connection to be<br>
"community substance," a separate entity than either the subjective "I" or<br>
external reality.  I have termed it "consensual reality" on the list<br>
before, but people got tired of it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You, Ian, cannot ever feel what I feel inside, nor can any experiment </i><br>
<i>&gt;test any theory about what I feel, subjectivity is impenetrable. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: True, but that limitation only defines a <br>
  limit on my nervous system, not my identity/self.<br>
<p>
That "my" in "my nervous system," why isn't there just a universal nervous<br>
system?  Why do you use the term "my" if "my" isn't separate?  You simply<br>
cannot define away subjectivity with any set of axioms or predicates.  The<br>
axiom-making or predicate-making entity precedes the axioms and predicates<br>
and that entity is unique and impenetrable, a point source of force. <br>
Sometime, pick up Wittgenstein's "Philosophical Investigations" (1953). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There really is something that gives coherency to the subjective </i><br>
<i>&gt;"I" and that something constructs a boundary between one quark</i><br>
<i>&gt;or bit of substance and the quark immediately next to it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: What is this "something."<br>
<p>
You brought this up when you wrote 3/1/98: &lt;The most persuasive argument<br>
about the nature of the individual "soul" that I've heard is that it is<br>
more than the atoms of which the brain is composed, but this "more" is not<br>
a supernatural spirit, it's simply the ordering of those atoms.&gt;<br>
<p>
Rather than "ordering," which is a more static term, I think "coherency" is<br>
a more dynamic term.  But if you like the term "ordering" better, what were<br>
you referring to, what provides the ordering?<br>
<p>
Phil Chapman wrote this lovely poem 3/3/98: <br>
<p>
Blue<br>
<p>
If I think blue and ask you too<br>
You will but then again you won't<br>
For I've seen skies you've never seen<br>
And you've said things I've not<br>
<p>
So since my blue is blue to me<br>
And yours to me is not<br>
Then I'll think blue and so will you<br>
But we'll be blue, apart<br>
<p>
Ah, the beauty of the analog!  How I weary of this digital age, where half<br>
of reality is sampled out of existence, and with algorithms and compression<br>
techniques, more than half.  What a paucity!  How threadbare!  And if I<br>
find out that "Phil Chapman" is really a computer, hacking poetry together,<br>
well then, I'll delete this file and move on to something meaningful.<br>
