<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  1) When technology is primitive it's difficult to create wealth;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;     wealth is not conserved it can be created, and there are easier</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     ways to get power and money.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  2) The power of offensive weapons has increased enormously while the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     increase in defensive weapons has been much more modest. War is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     no longer profitable.</i><br>
<p>
This point would indicate to me that war has become enormously profitable, to the<br>
winner. Witness the Gulf War, which cost the US less than $5 billion (while US<br>
weapons industries raked in $60 billion, mostly from other countries, a handy<br>
return on investment...). If the US were more interested in becoming an empire,<br>
it really would not have much opposition. Numerically yes, but technologically<br>
not in any way, shape or form.<br>
<p>
Fortunately Americans have found, and proven to most of the rest of the world<br>
that it is much easier to build an empire through business shenannigans than<br>
through outright force, its more stable in the long run, and nobody gets shot.<br>
<p>
I would say that the reason why nations like Imperial Japan, nazi Germany, and<br>
the USSR are no longer in existence is that the rest of humanity know how rude it<br>
is to be a military agressor nation, and cooperated to bring down the first two,<br>
while they defeated the third by simply giving it the silent treatment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; An interesting factual tidbit to ponder: no two countries that</i><br>
<i>&gt; both have a Macdonald's franchise have ever gone to war against</i><br>
<i>&gt; each other.</i><br>
<p>
What I worry about is when The Corporate Republic of MacDonalds declares war on<br>
the Corporate Republic of Burger King. To be known as The Food Fight, it will<br>
kill more bystanders from indiscriminate use of second hand cholesterol<br>
weapons.....<br>
