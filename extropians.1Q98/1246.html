I hear your challenge and raise you one Hellen Keller. Failing that, try<br>
looking into the treatment of blind people back before Braile was invented,<br>
or deaf-blind people for that matter. <br>
<p>
Human beings are sentient and can communicate. The organs of communication<br>
are not essential for sentient existence. Ergo, here is an existence<br>
proof for sentience in the absence of communication.<br>
<p>
Of course, using this as an argument against eating cattle is highly<br>
suspect; it can be taken to ridiculous extremes. ("Here's my pet rock, <br>
Elmer. Say hello to Elmer. Sorry he can't hear you, but I assure you he's <br>
pleased to meet you.") However, I'm deeply uneasy about arguments based<br>
on the idea that anything that can't talk or write isn't worthy of some<br>
consideration; and I suspect that if she could form grammatically correct<br>
structures and communicate them my pet cat would agree with me.<br>
<p>
(As an aside, however, I _do_ apply your communication/sentience argument<br>
to the oxymoronic topic of "animal rights". Rights imply a contractual<br>
arrangement; if I can enter into an agreement with another species, then,<br>
well, I'll concede it has rights. If it can't enter into an agreement with<br>
me, though, any concessions I make to it can't, by definition, be contractual <br>
rights.)<br>

<p>
Eh?<br>
<p>
You're assuming a rights-based transaction between humans and their prey.<br>
But what's to stop the humans simply voluntarily conceding that they * will<br>
not eat meat *, no matter what? Like, maybe, because they don't like the<br>
taste? They need concede no rights whatsoever to the animals in order to<br>
justify not eating them.<br>
<p>
My cat is a carnivore. She 'thinks' anything that moves and is smaller<br>
than her is food -- simple as that. (I have no _idea_ what she thinks I<br>
am.) I am an omnivore, but I don't feel any urge to eat my cat, even though<br>
I'm told cats are edible. Just to add to the picture, my girlfriend is<br>
a vegan, _but_ when quizzed about it confesses to not knowing how she'd<br>
react if anyone came up with a way of farming anencephalic cattle (which<br>
opens another can of worms, as genetically engineered anencephalic frogs <br>
and mice are yesterday's headlines).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If the human race becomes all herbivores, what species will then claim the job</i><br>
<i>&gt; of top carnivore???</i><br>
 <br>
The species that have already got it. Remember, we're all food for the<br>
prokaryotes in the end. (At least until we manage to develop uploading.<br>
And even then, we might find there's something that eats human minds ...)<br>
