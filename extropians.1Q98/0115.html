<i>&gt; &gt; Two messages illustrate the point I was trying to make about kneejerk</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; What legitimate reason could anybody</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; device in order to find out if he had commited a crime?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Rights of the accused seem to function mostly as insurance against</i><br>

<i>&gt; 100% accurate, then there may be no reason for the accused to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights. But 100% accuracy is impossible. Even if the probability of error</i><br>
<i>&gt; is very small, it may be that most people are risk-averse enough to want</i><br>
<i>&gt; the accused to have the right of refusing being scanned.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

I think you are exposing your miscomprehensions of prejudices. Just<br>
because you are accused does not make you guilty, and if in the event<br>
such technology were approved for use, I sincerely hope that it were<br>
only used AFTER a jury had convicted. This way, the person is legally<br>
guilty at that point, and the scan would only be used to a) give a quick<br>
way for the accused/convicted to clear themselves without a long appeals<br>
process, or b) to affirm that the convicted is truly guilty, so that the<br>
jury can then feel comfortable with imposing the death penalty, to know<br>
that the convicted is truly guilty, that they actually guessed right.<br>
<p>
If one is accused, one is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty to<br>
whatever shade of doubt, therefore, if one is innocent, they they should<br>
be accorded all extension of rights of privacy. If this is not done,<br>
you'll get a mob mentality going where people think they can accuse<br>
anybody and just go around scanning people at will. Now, if someone were<br>
accused, and didn't want to go through a long and expensive court<br>
process, it could be their right to waive privacy and agree to the scan,<br>
but this should only be available for use with units that are totally<br>
sheilded and isolated, and their entire systems designs and construction<br>
are available for public scrutiny to verify no possibility of violation<br>
of privacy beyond the query of guilt for the crime with which the person<br>
is accused.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another possible answer is that we want law-enforcement to be less</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficient, not more. In an ideal world where all relationships are</i><br>
<i>&gt; consensual, no law (unless it's unanimous) would be enforceable.</i><br>
<p>
THe problem with quick and easy justice methods, is that they tend to<br>
encourage the proliferation of laws into all aspects of one's life. This<br>
has been seen when the guillotine was used during the French revolution.<br>
Mere suspicion of something?? "off wit dere eds". THis method of quick<br>
justice paved the way for wholesale slaughter of thousands on nothing<br>
but grudges...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you could extract a single bit from someone's mind-state, what would</i><br>
<i>&gt; the bit encode, and whose mind would it be?</i><br>
<p>
And how would you know that the act of observation did not interfere<br>
with the state of that which was observed????<br>
