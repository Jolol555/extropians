&lt; But did [Tipler's] ideas really require that the<br>
*entire* universe collapse into a singularity?  Or<br>
would it work if only a sufficiently large,<br>
life-filled part of it collapsed into a singularity? <br>
What if life does, as Nick Bostrom suggested, send<br>
devices out into the universe which send matter back<br>
to some area.  If enough is sent back, the mass will<br>
collapse into a black hole.  If life organizes this<br>
right, will it be able to accomplish Tipler's ideas? <br>
Is there enough energy in the creation of this<br>
singularity to simulate a universe of infinite<br>
(subjective) length, as Tipler proposes there would<br>
be if the entire universe collapsed? &gt;<br>
<p>
What you describe here sounds similar to what Life<br>
already does with each individual organism. It may<br>
also reflect how the cosmos already works as well.<br>

Check out the cover story of the Jan 1998 Scientific<br>
American at<br>
<a href="http://www.sciam.com/1998/0198issue/0198ingber.html">http://www.sciam.com/1998/0198issue/0198ingber.html</a>.<br>
It's called "The Architecture of Life" and Donald<br>
Ingber describes his work at the MIT Center for<br>
Bioengineering on applications of the architectural<br>
principles of 'tensegrity' to biology. The point that<br>
I find most relevant to singularities comes at the<br>
article's conclusion where Ingber speculates: "the<br>
fact that our expanding (tensing) universe contains<br>
huge filaments of gravitationally linked galaxies and<br>
isolated black holes that experience immense<br>
compressive forces locally can only lead us to<br>
wonder. Perhaps there is a single underlying theme to<br>
nature after all."  In other words, tensegrity seems<br>
to apply from the cell all the way up to the<br>
structure of the universe.<br>
<p>
Tipler's "physics of immortality" always struck me as<br>
being 'rather' totalitarian.  Gregory Benford's novel<br>
_Sailing Bright Eternity_ describes the possibilities<br>
for Omega-pointish 'computation' at the somewhat more<br>
benign 'distributed' level of galactic black holes<br>
(definitely an essential novel for the Extropian book<br>
shelf - BTW, Benford's term is KENE, not KEME, as the<br>
other thread keeps putting it.)<br>
<p>
As for Tipler's idea of infinite subjective time;<br>
well, that's a more subjective subject ;-)<br>
<p>
I find it amusing to note that some mystics like this<br>
idea as well.  I'm thinking, in particular, of Carlos<br>
Castaneda who, by the way, now gives fitness seminars<br>
and sells videos that incorporate the tensegrity<br>
concepts!  In Castaneda's 9603 "Readers of Infinity:<br>
A Journal of Applied Hermeneutics", he explicitly<br>
tries to bring the concept of black holes to the<br>
personal level: "[Don Juan's] contention was that<br>
this vibratory, agglutinating force that holds<br>
together the conglomerate of energy fields that we<br>
are is apparently similar to what modern-day<br>
astronomers believe must happen at the core of all<br>
the galaxies that exist in the cosmos".  And,<br>
somewhere in his earlier books, Castaneda also wrote<br>
this, about a 'Warrior's Last Stand':<br>
<p>
"... when his time on earth is up ... his spirit<br>
which is always ready, flies to the place of his<br>
predilection and there the warrior dances to his<br>
death ... If a warrior has limited power, his dance<br>
is short; if his power is grandiose, his dance is<br>
magnificent.  But regardless of whether his power is<br>
small or magnificent, death must stop to witness his<br>
last stand on earth. Death cannot overtake the<br>
warrior who is recounting the toil of his life for<br>
the last time until he has finished his dance".<br>
<p>
Linda Nagata's story _Tech Heaven_ even wonders<br>
whether something similar might happen to a<br>
cryonically-preserved person...<br>
