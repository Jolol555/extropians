Of course. But what if you really aren't yourself at that time, i.e. in some kind of<br>
fit that has blocked out your "normal" consciousness? Maybe the libertarian<br>
solution would be to make a deal with others while fully conscious that allows<br>
them to act on behalf of your primary persona during a fit or longer period<br>
of insanity. There are however some problems with this, like what are people<br>
to do during your first fit (no instructions), or what about strangers who see<br>
you running around a busy highway naked and screaming etc. Sometimes<br>
coercion can be really for one's own good (but I agree, it should be kept to<br>
an absolute minimum).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A drunk</i><br>
<i>&gt; or addict cannot get sober solely through the actions of others, but only through</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; personal will to do so, </i><br>
Maybe this is more or less true at the moment(?), but I suppose that future medics<br>
will<br>
be able to correct any mental problem, whithout requiring your co-operation. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; nor should a person who has decided to end their lives be</i><br>

people for<br>
<i>&gt; doing so. </i><br>
Well, if you assume that there are in fact multiple personalities, of which one (or<br>
more)<br>
want(s) to live while the other(s) want(s) to die, then at least a part of that<br>
person will<br>
be truly grateful for saving him from the alter ego(s) that hijacked his mind. The<br>
only <br>
problem could be: which one of the multiple personalities is the "real" one? Or:<br>
who's<br>
rights should be respected? Maybe forcibly curing the person isn't such a bad idea<br>
after all, because this is in fact the only way to please *both* personalities: the <br>
suicidal one gets removed (his deathwish is granted) while the other, non-suicidal <br>
one stays alive. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just as the freedom of speech means that one has the freedom to NOT speak, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; right to life guarrantees that the individual has the right to decide when NOT to</i><br>
live,<br>
<i>&gt; otherwise, it is no right at all.</i><br>
I agree, but with the mentally ill things are somewhat more complicated (see above).<br>
