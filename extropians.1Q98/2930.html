Sounds like it might become quite popular. Unfortunately, it might<br>
become rather useless: the postmodern eclecticism ("let's mix<br>
everything, it is just cultural constructs anyway") goes well with the<br>
a-rational aspects of zen, and the drugs and techno will of course<br>
make it a hit with the ravers.<br>
<p>
Before trying to come up with a modern form of zen, we might ponder<br>
what we want to achieve instead.<br>
<p>
I think the old systems for mental training have a lot going for<br>
them. Unfortunately they are filled with plenty of junk<br>
(i.e. ideas/settings that are unsupported, but passed down as great<br>
revelation or dogma since nobody has dared question them) and<br>
non-scientific thinking. Science is the organized search for<br>
knowledge, many of these systems actually try to reach knowledge<br>
through fairly formalized structures, but they lack the interest in<br>
making the results accessible, replicable and useful. A modern mental<br>
system ought to include that.<br>
<p>
As for myself, I have begun thinking a bit on "The Way of Science", in<br>
analogy to budo ("The Way of the Warrior"; what would the TWoS become<br>
in japanese?). Nothing solid yet, but I think it is a worthwhile<br>
exercise.<br>
