The divergent-trajectories-future is unpredictable, the future of<br>
superintelligences is doubly unpredictable. Engineering the Singularity to<br>
make it more benign may well be a dream. The Singularity itself may well<br>
be a dream. Get real.<br>

I don't think that this community is capable of making a major difference. <br>
(Please prove me wrong). Don't forget, the whole industrialized world is<br>
our fifth column.<br>

Instead of 'criminal' I'd say 'incomprehensible'. Do you feel like a<br>
monster just because you have made the clay autoreplicators, or a world of<br>
lithobacteria impossible? It's lonely, at the top of the food chain.<br>

_Should_ it be unavoidable, being disturbed is not exactly constructive. <br>
Just lay back, and think of England. If it happens at all, it will be over<br>
real quick.<br>

No evidence of anysuch within our light cone.<br>

<i>&gt; **Please understand that I am trying very hard not to label such acts of global</i><br>

How good that you are talking about purely hypothetical acts only.<br>
