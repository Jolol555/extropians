Alas, many systems are intrinsically brittle in regards to mutations (no<br>
neutral mutations, most mutations catastrophic -- the system randomwalks<br>
in a chaotic fitness landscape). E.g. mutating processor instructions is<br>
worse than mutating a subset of the same instructions, which is worse than<br>
mutating a subset of SEXPR's. Which is worse than.. say mutating<br>
connectivity in automaton networks with a certain Hamiltonian. The chance<br>
of an ad-hoc system being near-optimal in regards to GA-optimization is<br>
nil. If you allow the mutation function to mutate (quis custodiet...), it<br>
will just gloss over the ugly edges with time. However, simply (well, it<br>
is maybe not sooo simple) searching for the optimal system's parameters,<br>
subsequently implementing them in dedicated hardware appears easier. As an<br>
aesthete, I just don't believe in long-term usefulness of systems with<br>
hidden holes.<br>

Speed is another _major_ bottleneck. However, speed without proper<br>
mutation fitness landscape brings nothing.<br>

Of course. While coding a robot arm GA-learn the inverse kinematics<br>
appears easy, higher problem-solving skills are not.<br>
