When I lived in rural Nebraska from '85-'87 "ditchweed" (as it was indeed<br>
called) was as abundant as ever.  What I found really interesting was that<br>
none of the locals collected or smoked it despite the fact that it grew<br>
absolutely everywhere.  However, people from the East and West coast would<br>
frequently come out and harvest it, occasionally getting busted for their<br>
effort.<br>
