I've always liked the ole balinese saying:<br>
<p>
"we have no art, we do everything as best we can."<br>
<p>
In a society where the ability to draw, to paint, to sculpt, to<br>
carve, to weave, to make pottery, to sing, to dance, and to play a<br>
variety of musical instruments, is considered to be the skill set<br>
of any normal member of the society, what is art?<br>
<p>
Checking the above list I can see where I'm currently lacking some<br>
of these abilities to some degree. Rather than to sit and wag an<br>
insolent finger at those responsible for my early education, I now<br>
take responsibility for completeing this list myself, as well as<br>
expanding the list! I also look forward to enhancing the education<br>
of any youngsters/oldsters who cross my path.<br>
<p>
Wandering around Chicago's Art Institute this weekend, I had reason<br>
everywhere I looked to stay around a few more hundred years at<br>
least.......<br>
