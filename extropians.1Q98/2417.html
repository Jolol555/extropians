     As a member of the 'right to life' movement, I could venture a<br>
guess.  It would utterly destroy the movement (fragment completely) if I<br>
were able to convince the rest of the 'movement' to expand it's<br>
political scope beyond just the one issue and support (my opinion) the<br>
moral and consistent position.  That is, to support birth control and<br>
the opposite of what Michael Lorrey approves "the death penalty, the<br>
right to suicide, legality of assisted suicide, self defense with deadly<br>
weapons, and the hunting of and consumption of animals."  You quickly<br>
loose all support and are soon politically marginalized..  However, I<br>
expect the movement to be more consistent (WAG) within 25 years.<br>
    A person can be consistent on this issue (either side) today,<br>
however everyone will label you a kook.  They are probably right.<br>
