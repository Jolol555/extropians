Machine is not a proper thing to label a human.  Because we as humans are<br>
more than machine or animal yet <br>
we are very much both.  When a computer becomes aware, it will become<br>
more than a machine, and most likely be insulted if we were to call it a<br>
machine."<br>
<p>
I don't understand how "awareness" magically makes a machine not a<br>
machine or more than a machine.  Its fundamental processes are still the<br>
same; it's mechanisms for going from one state to another are still<br>
fundamentally the same.  If we are fundamentally machines, then being<br>
sentient doesn't make us not machines or more than machines; it puts us<br>
in a different category of machines, sentient machines.  I think your<br>
reluctance in labeling humans "machines" is that your concept of machine<br>
is based on currently existing human artifacts, rather than the abstract<br>
category of machine, which loosely includes any physical system which has<br>
"rules" governing its change from one state to another.  So, unless<br>
there's something mystical going on (and if the mystical is not<br>
rule-bound), then humans are machines.  <br>
<p>
We are who we are whether we call ourselves "machines" or not.  But if we<br>
understand ourselves to be machines, then that gives us great hope about<br>
what sorts of machines we may be able to create.  And if we are machines,<br>
then how could knowing our true nature be insulting?  <br>
