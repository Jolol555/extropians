There is a rapid growth of salary levels for high-tech/computer<br>
professionals, and a growing number of positions that companies just can't<br>
fill at any reasonable price.  This is what makes this market very different<br>
from that of, say, janitorial services.  Companies are greedy, of course,<br>
nut there are good reasons why they are exercising their greed in this<br>
domain rather than any other.  Another point is the exterritorial nature<br>
of high-tech jobs.  Janitors, manicurists, etc. work for the local market;<br>
there is no sense in collecting all of them from all over the world, to<br>
work in U.S.  However, if all developers of frontier information technology<br>
immigrated into U.S., they would still serve the same - global - market,<br>
but enrich American corporations, American government, and local businesses<br>
with results of their work, taxes, etc.<br>
