You are right in some respects.  There is much more to it than you <br>
are taking into account, though.  From my personal knowladge on <br>
automotive auto sound.  100 bit d/a converters are available and are <br>
in use though not very widely.  i belive there is a home theater <br>
company in England that has produced and marketed a DVD player with <br>
"true" sound capibility.  Many car stereos have 20 bit d/a <br>
converters, even a couple.  The main reason the 100 bit's are not <br>
used is the cost to sound quality ratio.  It just is not practical to <br>
have absolutley clear sound when the human cannot recognize the <br>
differance.<br>
A few companys are venturing into the digital environment, Kef Kar, <br>
Pioneer, Alpine, Clarion, Eclipse, ect...  these companys have made <br>
it possiable for the average consumers to purchase digital audio <br>
systems.  New to even the digital system and a great improvement of <br>
it is Kef's new 5.1 converter.  It is a device that takes DVD like <br>
disks and replayes the sound on five chanels and a subwoofer chanel.  <br>
<i>&gt;From what I have read it is a spectacular sound, as it should be.</i><br>
Another advantage to the digital world is fiber-optics, a grand <br>
invention that I love so dear.  The use of fiber-optic wire has a <br>
land-slide advantage over conventional ofc.  The greatest of these is <br>
no distortion and no loss of signal power.<br>
<p>
hopefully this is the topic you were on.  If not, well you learned <br>
something.<br>
