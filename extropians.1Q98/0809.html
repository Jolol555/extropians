This is not meant to explain or protest on behalf of anarchism, just to<br>
present an interesting analogy:<br>
<p>
There is no Protestant party line.  Different types of protestants<br>
believe different sorts of things.  The one thing they have in common is<br>
a belief that an intermediary between God and People isn't needed.  There<br>
is no protestant alternative to the Pope except personal prayer and good<br>
living, variously defined.<br>
<p>
Similarly, all an anarchist believes, all anarchism says, is that<br>
government isn't needed to intervene between reality and people.<br>
We don't all believe in the same things.  We offer no alternative to<br>
government except various ideas about things people can do on their own.<br>
<p>
In this light the progress of Western Thought is a slow painful<br>
simplification.<br>
