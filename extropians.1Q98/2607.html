<i>&gt; &gt; A few people on this list, myself included, have commented on taking</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; So, how about some people share their wisdom as to why it wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; work, what such an organisation should do if it could work, and how to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; go about implementing it.  I have some ideas of my own, but for now</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'm going to keep them shadowy and elusive...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; At least in the U.S., it is a felony to participate in a conspiracy. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; you make</i><br>
<i>&gt; an exhortation in an e-mail that somebody else do simething illegal, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the person enetes into a discussion with and subsequently performs that</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegal act, then you have technically committed conspiracy. I'm less</i><br>
<i>&gt; clear</i><br>
<i>&gt; on whether or not the other participants in the discussion are also guilty</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; of consciracy, but they might be. In light of this, please hold such</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussions</i><br>
<i>&gt; only among those who wish to be involved. Thanks.</i><br>
<p>
Since it isn't illegal right now for private citizens to clone, then it can't<br>
be conspiracy to do so right now.<br>
<p>
Besides, there can be a decent case made that the federal prosecution of<br>
public email discussions as conspiracy, if and when it becomes illegal, for<br>
cloning in private could be found to be capricious enforcement, since the past<br>
few years millions, if not billions of email messages have been sent across<br>
the US, and across our internaitonal borders which contained the<br>
RC4-3lines-PERL encryption algorythm. That they have not prosecuted one person<br>
who engaged in this mass act of civil disobedience is a significant precedent<br>
against their use of public mail list messages as evidence of conspiracy. That<br>
this discussion is public, and not private, indicates that this is more of a<br>
forum for public protest than secretive conspiracy.<br>
