<i>|3rd Expert Claims Probe of Brown's Death Botched</i><br>
<i>|By Christopher Ruddy</i><br>
<i>|FOR THE TRIBUNE-REVIEW</i><br>
<i>|January 13, 1998</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Washington - The head of the Armed Forces Institute of</i><br>
<i>|Pathology's forensic photography unit, like two other</i><br>
<i>|senior officials before her, has come forward to</i><br>
<i>|publicly claim that the military improperly handled the</i><br>
<i>|investigation of the death of Commerce Secretary Ron</i><br>
<i>|Brown.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Chief Petty Officer Kathleen Janoski, a 22 year Navy</i><br>
<i>|veteran, also says she was told missing evidence of a</i><br>
<i>|possible homicide had been purposely destroyed.</i><br>
<i>|Janoski, the senior enlisted person at AFIP's</i><br>
<i>|Rockville, Md., offices, was present when Brown's body</i><br>
<i>|was examined by military pathologists at Dover Air</i><br>
<i>|Force Base in Delaware.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|The examination of Brown's remains took place four days</i><br>
<i>|after an Air Force CT-43 jet carrying him and 34 others</i><br>
<i>|crashed into a mountainside near Croatia's Dubrovnik</i><br>
<i>|airport on April 3, 1996.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Janoski had initially declined to be interviewed but</i><br>
<i>|changed her mind shortly before a gag order was issued</i><br>
<i>|to AFIP staff. She came forward, she said, because AFIP</i><br>
<i>|had failed to properly investigate possible wrongdoing</i><br>
<i>|by its own officials in the Brown case, and because of</i><br>
<i>|the way the military treated two AFIP pathologists, Air</i><br>
<i>|Force Lt. Col. Steve Cogswell and Army Lt. Col. David</i><br>
<i>|Hause. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|In Tribune-Review articles last month, Cogswell and</i><br>
<i>|Hause both went public about a small circular hole</i><br>
<i>|found in the very top of Brown's head. Both</i><br>
<i>|pathologists contend it looked like a gunshot wound and</i><br>
<i>|should have prompted an autopsy. No autopsy was</i><br>
<i>|performed.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Janoski said she was disturbed by criticism of the</i><br>
<i>|lieutenant colonels and suggestions that their actions</i><br>
<i>|may be politically motivated. She described both</i><br>
<i>|pathologists as "serious professionals" and</i><br>
<i>|"competent." </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Partisan politics has nothing to do with the issues at</i><br>
<i>|hand, she suggested, noting that she has been a</i><br>
<i>|lifelong and active Democrat, beginning with volunteer</i><br>
<i>|work for the 1972 presidential campaign of George</i><br>
<i>|McGovern. She says she voted for Bill Clinton and is</i><br>
<i>|proud to receive a White House Christmas Card each year</i><br>
<i>|for having worked as a volunteer at the Clinton White</i><br>
<i>|House.  </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|INTERNAL PROBE </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|After Cogswell's allegations first surfaced in the</i><br>
<i>|Tribune-Review, AFIP launched an internal investigation</i><br>
<i>|of Cogswell and others to find out why and how the</i><br>
<i>|information about Brown's head wound got to the press. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Janoski said she was stunned that AFIP inquiry focused</i><br>
<i>|on the actions of Cogswell when she felt the real issue</i><br>
<i>|was AFIP's handling of Brown's death. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|"The investigation is nothing more than a witch hunt.</i><br>
<i>|(AFIP) should be investigating what happened to the</i><br>
<i>|missing head X-rays. No one at AFIP seems to care that</i><br>
<i>|Brown did not receive an autopsy," Janoski said.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|On Easter Sunday, 1996, the task of examining Brown's</i><br>
<i>|body fell to Col. William Gormley, the highest ranking</i><br>
<i>|AFIP officer at Dover that day. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|While Gormley conducted an external examination of</i><br>
<i>|Brown's body, Janoski was busy photographing and</i><br>
<i>|documenting his injuries. Brown was still partially</i><br>
<i>|clad in a his torn trousers. His body was intact, with</i><br>
<i>|chemical burns to his torso and face and several</i><br>
<i>|noticeable lacerations on the front, sides and top of</i><br>
<i>|his head. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|As she continued to shoot photos, she noticed a large</i><br>
<i>|area of torn skin that left the top of Brown's skull</i><br>
<i>|exposed. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|She was startled to find another injury. Dead center in</i><br>
<i>|the top of the head she observed what appeared to her</i><br>
<i>|to be a gunshot wound: a perfectly circular hole in the</i><br>
<i>|skull. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|"Wow, look at the hole in Ron Brown's head. It looks</i><br>
<i>|like a gunshot wound," Janoski recalls exclaiming.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Janoski has served as chief of forensic photography for</i><br>
<i>|2 (1/2) years, and has, by her account, handled</i><br>
<i>|numerous cases involving either gunshots or plane</i><br>
<i>|crashes. She received training at the FBI Academy and</i><br>
<i>|elsewhere in observing, identifying and photographing</i><br>
<i>|gunshot and other wounds. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Janoski's comments caused an immediate hubbub in the</i><br>
<i>|morgue facility, and several pathologists came over to</i><br>
<i>|view the wound. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|One was Hause, a former Gulf War combat surgeon with </i><br>
<i>|significant plane accident and gunshot experience.</i><br>
<i>|Hause examined the hole and said it looked like a .45</i><br>
<i>|caliber gunshot entry wound.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Gormley, who has approximately 25 years of experience</i><br>
<i>|in pathology, has said that he, too, identified the</i><br>
<i>|wound as a "red flag" and that he consulted with other</i><br>
<i>|pathologists present, including Hause and Navy Cmdr.</i><br>
<i>|Edward Kilbane.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|"They agreed it look like an entrance gunshot wound,"</i><br>
<i>|Gormley recalled in a recent television interview. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|In two interviews with the Tribune-Review, Gormley</i><br>
<i>|maintained he ruled out the possibility of a gunshot</i><br>
<i>|because he observed, on closer inspection, that the</i><br>
<i>|circular hole did not penetrate Brown's skull into the</i><br>
<i>|brain. He said the brain was not visible, and had a</i><br>
<i>|bullet struck Brown's head, it would have penetrated</i><br>
<i>|the skull. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Soon after the Tribune-Review published a photograph of</i><br>
<i>|the wound as well as photos of X-rays that showed the</i><br>
<i>|skull had been penetrated, Gormley changed his story. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|During a television appearance, he admitted that the</i><br>
<i>|photo and X-ray indeed showed the skull was penetrated</i><br>
<i>|and brown's brain was visible.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Gormley noted it had been more than a year and a half</i><br>
<i>|since the Brown crash, and said he had simply forgotten</i><br>
<i>|what the wound looked like. In his initial report on</i><br>
<i>|the examination, Gormley noted the bullet had</i><br>
<i>|penetrated the skull. He maintained that the hole</i><br>
<i>|definitely wasn't a gunshot wound because X-rays showed</i><br>
<i>|no slug or metal fragments in the head, and there was</i><br>
<i>|no exit wound.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|In a recent press statement, AFIP said extensive</i><br>
<i>|"forensic tests" disproved a bullet theory. Janoski</i><br>
<i>|said she was present for the entire examination and she</i><br>
<i>|did not observe any forensic tests, such those for</i><br>
<i>|gunpowder residue around the wound. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|MISSING X-RAYS</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|In addition to pictures of the corpse itself, Janoski</i><br>
<i>|took photos of the original head and body X-rays while</i><br>
<i>|they were pinned to a lightbox.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|After her slide film was developed, Janoski said she</i><br>
<i>|stored the images, which are typically used by</i><br>
<i>|pathologists for lectures and are not part of the</i><br>
<i>|official case file, in her office desk.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Almost six months later, Janoski said she was prompted</i><br>
<i>|to review the film after Brown's name surfaced during a</i><br>
<i>|discussion with Jean Marie Sentell, a naval criminal</i><br>
<i>|investigator assigned to the AFIP. Sentell had also</i><br>
<i>|been present when Brown's body was examined. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Janoski alleges Sentell told her the original X-rays of</i><br>
<i>|Brown's head had been replaced in the case file.</i><br>
<i>|Janoski said she remembers that Sentell specifically</i><br>
<i>|told her "the first head X-ray that showed a 'lead</i><br>
<i>|snowstorm' was destroyed, and a second X-ray, that was</i><br>
<i>|less dense, was taken."</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Janoski said she had to ask, "What are you talking</i><br>
<i>|about?" in reference to Sentell's phrase "lead</i><br>
<i>|snowstorm." According to Janoski, Sentell explained</i><br>
<i>|that a lead snowstorm is the description of a pattern</i><br>
<i>|of metal fragments that appears on an X-ray after a</i><br>
<i>|bullet has disintegrated inside a body. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Janoski said Sentell did not say who destroyed the X-</i><br>
<i>|rays. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Sentell did not respond to repeated Tribune-Review</i><br>
<i>|phone messages seeking comment, even after being</i><br>
<i>|informed of Janoski's statements. An AFIP spokesman</i><br>
<i>|said Sentell declined to be interviewed. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|After the conversation with Sentell, Janoski said she</i><br>
<i>|rummaged through her own desk and found the slide film</i><br>
<i>|she had taken of the original head X-rays. She gave the</i><br>
<i>|film to Cogswell to review. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Cogswell contends the original frontal X-ray of Brown's</i><br>
<i>|head indeed showed an apparent "lead snowstorm" of</i><br>
<i>|metal fragments in brown's head. Cogswell has stated</i><br>
<i>|that the suspicious hole and the X-ray should have</i><br>
<i>|prompted AFIP to notify the FBI that Brown's death was</i><br>
<i>|a possible homicide.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Cogswell, too, has alleged that he heard that the first</i><br>
<i>|X-rays were destroyed. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Still curious about the matter, Janoski pulled out</i><br>
<i>|Brown's official case file and discovered that the file</i><br>
<i>|contained only 15 X-rays of Brown, none of which were</i><br>
<i>|of the skull. She found neither of the original X-rays</i><br>
<i>|that she had photographed on the lightbox. </i><br>
<i>| </i><br>
<i>|Janoski said she became terrified when she realized</i><br>
<i>|that "I  possessed the only physical evidence that</i><br>
<i>|those X-rays ever existed."  </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|AFIP director Col. Michael Dickerson has acknowledged</i><br>
<i>|that all  skull X-rays of Brown are missing from the</i><br>
<i>|case file. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Gormley has stated that the initial head X-rays did</i><br>
<i>|show possible fragments that concerned him at the time,</i><br>
<i>|but that Brown's head was X-rayed again and he</i><br>
<i>|discovered the pattern of fragments on the initial </i><br>
<i>|X-ray was actually caused by a defect in the </i><br>
<i>|reusable film cartridge. </i><br>
<i>|     </i><br>
<i>|The new images did not show any fragments in the head,</i><br>
<i>|but they, like the originals photographed by Janoski,</i><br>
<i>|have disappeared.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|One of the pathologists involved questions the timing</i><br>
<i>|of AFIP's explanation.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|"I find it interesting that this explanation about the</i><br>
<i>|film cartridge defect came after Lt. Col Cogswell made</i><br>
<i>|his allegations, and not at the time we were at Dover,"</i><br>
<i>|said Hause. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Hause, who made these comments to the Tribune-Review</i><br>
<i>|before a gag order had been placed on AFIP staff, said</i><br>
<i>|he does not recall ever being told there was problem</i><br>
<i>|with the X-rays. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Janoski noted that the photos she took of other Brown</i><br>
<i>|X-rays on the light box did not show any such pattern.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Gormley and AFIP have not offered any explanation for</i><br>
<i>|how the  X-rays disappeared. Gormley referred calls to</i><br>
<i>|AFIP spokesman Chris Kelly,  who said that Gormley</i><br>
<i>|would not grant an additional interview.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|In recent days, Janoski was contacted and asked if she</i><br>
<i>|stood by her earlier comments. She said she did and</i><br>
<i>|added that AFIP officials are determined to "turn Lt.</i><br>
<i>|Col. Cogswell into scapegoat."</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|She said AFIP investigators recently presented her with</i><br>
<i>|a list questions that focused on how the photographic</i><br>
<i>|images had found their way to the press. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|"I was never advised of my rights, and the tone and</i><br>
<i>|manner... was threatening and coercive," she said. </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Janoski reiterated to the Tribune-Review that she had</i><br>
<i>|done nothing improper, and that AFIP should be</i><br>
<i>|concentrating on why Ron Brown "did not receive a</i><br>
<i>|proper death investigation."</i><br>
