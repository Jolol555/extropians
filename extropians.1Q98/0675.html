IMHO, cloning in and of itself is not bad, what has to be considered is <br>
what you do with the clone afterwards. If you clone a Sheep, Dog or a <br>
Human, what do you do then, just chop it up for food or parts? The party <br>
involved should have a Parent's responsibility for that new organism. If I <br>
had a clone made of myself, and of course it would not grow to full size <br>
for many years, I would want to bring it up as a full person, not just a <br>
"body bag of parts". People seem to attach to much _religious_ topics to <br>
it, and not enough _natural_ topics.<br>
<p>
Whether it is Cloning, Abortion or Genetics/Eugenics, you would think <br>
people would apply parenting to the problem first. If you are stopping an <br>
organism from becoming fully alive, changing it's genetic life or even <br>
creating a new life, it is still deserves a modicum of respect. It just <br>
seems that the news blows it up as a threat to society?<br>

Fortunately enough, the mundanes understand effects of<br>
only few technologies that directly relate to their<br>
world (I do not expect any government to pass a ban<br>
on certain classes of QM theories, for example).<br>
Also, they ban the work when it mostly done, and<br>
is just about to produce a "scary" effect.<br>
  Even with these restrictions, they still work on<br>
biotech, crypto, etc., because they produce things<br>
the mundanes and their governments actually need now;<br>
this both creates a foundation for transformations<br>
of extropian interest, and raises the level of public<br>
acceptance (I find the levels of synthetic supplements<br>
consumption among regular athletes and New Age folk<br>
just amazing).<br>
  And then, at some point, there will be more ways to<br>
hide interesting research from the government, and<br>
people may have increased interest in it - if now<br>
millions of people risk severe punishment for using<br>
chemicals to build muscles or get high, just imagine<br>
what they'd do for dramatic health improvement and<br>
life extent ion.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile - could somebody build a cloning facility<br>
outside the "civilized" countries?<br>
