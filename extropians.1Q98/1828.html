<i>&gt; This is beginning to be alleviated. For thousands of years, humans have</i><br>
<i>&gt; supported their agricultural habit by using their own excrement for</i><br>
<i>&gt; fertilizer along with that of their cows and horses and pigs. This practice</i><br>
<i>&gt; ended early in this century with the Progressives pushing through the FDA</i><br>
<i>&gt; acts which made such use of human waste illegal. Since that time, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; topsoil in this country has steadily declined.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure that is the main reason, but it most likely contributes<br>
significantly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, in Texas and a few other places, this is beginning to be reversed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Biosolids (class B types, not the toxic class C) from New York City ("NEW</i><br>
<i>&gt; YORK CITY?" the Texans decry....) are being shipped to a few towns in Texas</i><br>
<i>&gt; and being spread over the land. The land is fully capable of handling as</i><br>
<i>&gt; much agriculture as we want if we put back our wastes.... This is not being</i><br>
<i>&gt; done, instead it is being drained into the oceans.</i><br>
<p>
[ I remember reading about the fertilizer trade in Stockholm during the<br>
ninteenth century. The waste was transported to two small islands<br>
outside of the harbor, where farmers bought it. The piles from<br>
different parts of the city were differently priced; the waste from<br>
the poorer southern parts were much better since it didn't contain so<br>
much toilet paper... :-) ]<br>
<p>
More seriously, an idea: we have problems with nutrient drainage into<br>
the oceans, which upsets local ecosystems, causes algae blooms and<br>
anaerobic sea bottoms. Are there some useful process to extract the<br>
nutrient from the over-fed water? For example, a large part of the<br>
bottoms of the Baltic Sea is utterly devoid of life except possibly<br>
sulphur bacteria. Would it be possible to economically use the<br>
sea-sludge for fertilizer?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If a species cannot cut it, then it either needs</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be improved or allowed to die out if it cannot, to be replaced with</i><br>
<i>&gt; another than can compete.</i><br>
<p>
This depends on your goals and values. If you value the *ecosystem* as<br>
a whole, then there is no point in preserving non-competitve<br>
species. But if you value the individual species and the information<br>
they contains, then it makes a lot of sense. After all, many people<br>
still value information and objects that have long since lost their<br>
relevance to ordinary life or competitiveness on the market (like<br>
veteran cars, many books, antiques and historical archives). <br>
<p>
Maybe there will one day be a market for antique ecosystems?<br>
