Is this a troll or what?  <br>
(Actually, i believe the proper word is "trawl", but this misspelling seems<br>
common.)<br>

I could have turned on CNN and heard what you just wrote.  You are spouting<br>
the party line of the concensus-based "science" of the general public.<br>
Your "devastation" has very marginal validity when evaluated rationally<br>
(and these issues have generally been discussed in great deal on this<br>
list).  I hope for your sake that you have a great deal of evidence to back<br>
up your claims of this omnipresent "doom and gloom", because few people on<br>
this list will accept it on your word or the concensus of the general<br>
population.<br>
