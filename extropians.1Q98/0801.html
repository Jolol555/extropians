The prevailing wisdom (and the one I know), is that the clock is reset by<br>
something called the retinohypothalamic tract, which is *supposed* to be a<br>
circuit that connects the retina/suprachiasmatic nucleus/hypothalamus/and<br>
pineal gland.  What happened to this circuit?  Do the auther's propose<br>
that is a fig newton of neuroscientist's imagination? (or an ancillary<br>
mechanism?) This seems very plausible to me... I've always wondered how<br>
moles have their clocks reset by light when they're blind!<br>
<p>
This whole blood thing makes a fair amount of sense.  It seems to me the<br>
clock must be generated by some chemical negative feedback mechanism,<br>
maybe this mechanism's chemical constituents are altered by the transfer<br>
of high energy electrons from a light-excited hemoglobin molecule?<br>
