On the one hand, nanotechnology renders traditional economic models obsolete until<br>
another (transient) resource limit is hit.  The "haves", having reached a high<br>
degree of self-sufficiency, would have no 'economic' reason to keep the<br>
"have-nots" around, as the they are not only potential competitors for shared<br>
resources but also possible future threats to their power.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, you suggest a good point about keeping the "have-not" majority<br>
around to provide a more interesting world.  This is certainly the case when it<br>
comes to memetic complexity, novelty and diversity.  Imagine what kind of world<br>
the nobility of England in the 16th century would have, had they achieved<br>
self-sufficiency and killed off the rest of Europe.  There would be very few left<br>
to tell new stories and perform and write new plays. The impact that the<br>
renaissance had on england would have never come to be. With few other creative<br>
entities still alive, a very boring world results.<br>
<p>
Thus, the technologically superior may have reason to keep the rest of the<br>
"have-nots" alive, if for nothing else than as a memetic resource to be tapped for<br>
their own pleasure and entertainment.<br>
<p>
One might argue, by saying that the same techno-elites could just as easily<br>
achieve sufficient AI running a genetic algorithmic 'difference' engine.  This<br>
engine would  mutate, create and engage them in a continuos stream of novelty and<br>
complexity, which through direct neuro-feedback, could increasingly tailor its<br>
stream to the maximum pleasure of the user.  The ultimate narcissist (wire head).<br>
