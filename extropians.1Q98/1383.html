Er, isn't this a bit of an over-simplification? I am not an astrophysicist,<br>
however I vaguely recall reading a fair bit lately about head-scratching<br>
over the initial era of expansion, and some suggestions (does the name<br>
Linde mean anything?) that it was driven by a one-off particle which<br>
subsequently disappeared behind an event horizon, creating yet another<br>
universe, to repeat the process all over again ad infinitum -- indeed,<br>
that our universe is just one of an infinite fractal foam of universes,<br>
all budding off one another whenever and wherever a singularity is<br>
formed. There's also been some muttering along the lines that this<br>
implies that universes that spawn lots of black holes are evolutionarily<br>
fit and will give rise to lots of children, and that our particular<br>
set-up (which permits massive stars, atomic nucleosynthesis, and <br>
supernovae) is particularly well-tuned for this.<br>
<p>
Or have I grasped the wrong end of the stick ...?<br>

"For me, the best thing about cyberpunk is that it taught me how to<br>
enjoy shopping malls, which used to terrify me. Now I just imagine the<br>
whole thing is two miles below the moon's surface, and that half the<br>
people's right-brains have been eaten by roboticized steel rats. And<br>
suddenly it's interesting again."<br>
