<i>&gt; There are several pitfalls, however.  These can be divided into</i><br>
<i>&gt; two major areas.  The first is understanding the mechanisms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; life extending chemicals.  Right now, there are several causal</i><br>
<i>&gt; models of aging.  These models are not necessarily alternative</i><br>
<i>&gt; models.  They do not always contradict one another.  Thus,</i><br>
<i>&gt; aging does seem to occur from the accumulation of damage</i><br>
<i>&gt; from free radicals and glycolisation (actually, two models) AND</i><br>
<i>&gt; ALSO from hormal changes, etc.  Sometimes a link between</i><br>
<i>&gt; a chemical - e.g., Vitamin E -- and a model -- here, free radical</i><br>
<i>&gt; damage -- is made.  In this example, Vitamin E is a powerful</i><br>
<i>&gt; antioxidant which prevents free radical damage among other</i><br>
<i>&gt; things. </i><br>
<p>
Let's not forget the possibility that there are underlying systemic or<br>
genetic causes for this (like a decreasing ability to produce<br>
anti-radical scavenger enzymes or decreasing cell repair). I have the<br>
feeling that there are several causal loops involved, not just some<br>
nice primary cause.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The second is developing other approaches.  Current delivery</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems are not very advanced.  The body can take of itself</i><br>
<i>&gt; mostly, so injecting or ingesting a chemical often does work at</i><br>
<i>&gt; extending lifespan.  However, when the oil filter in your car</i><br>
<i>&gt; gets old, you don't pour in some oil additives -- you change the</i><br>
<i>&gt; filter.  Following the analogy further, when you can't replace a</i><br>
<i>&gt; car part, often you can have it repaired.  Chemical life extension</i><br>
<i>&gt; is more like filling up with detergent gasoline then do major auto</i><br>
<i>&gt; repairs.  Of course, if nanotechnology arrives, this will be much</i><br>
<i>&gt; easier...</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately replacing aged organs doesn't seem to help much,<br>
especially since the organs we really would like to rejuvenate (immune<br>
system, endocrine system and possibly the brain) are not easy to<br>
transplant or replace.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the interim, we need strategies that are a bit more sophisticated</i><br>
<i>&gt; than ingesting some neat chemicals, yet are not so advanced as</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be only workable in computer simulations.  Where does this</i><br>
<i>&gt; interemediary between current life extension techniques and</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology lie?</i><br>
<p>
Biotechnology? I'm quite interested in the work that is being done<br>
with neural precursor cells, which could help repair the brain. Maybe<br>
we could use cloning to create totiopotent cells to replace our old<br>
(delivery is still a problem, of course). Another possibility is<br>
geneticly engineered cells or tissues that produce necessary hormones<br>
continually inside the body.<br>
