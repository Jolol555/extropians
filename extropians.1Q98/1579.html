I'm a newbie to this list, and have a lot of reading to do.  The<br>
current spat of mail seems to be mainly concerned with the efficacy<br>
of hemp and why more women are not extropians.  I have been a closet<br>
libertarian since college so I have no qualms about a discussion<br>
as to the medical uses of THC.  But quite honestly, while I believe<br>
the current controlled substance laws are ridiculous, I think it is<br>
a waste of time fighting for its legalization, or developing religious<br>
type zeal over spurious benefits it may or may not provide.  My goal<br>
in life is to help make the transhuman and extropian dreams come true.<br>
=20<br>
I am drawn to this group, because I am convinced that Dr. More has<br>
the same goals.  He also has his Sociology right.  Humanity is=20<br>
already on the road to transhumanism.  Easy examples can be found in<br>
my own family.  My daughter has a tooth implant to replace one<br>
that never developed.  My ex-wife has breast implants to enhance<br>
her sexuality (not that I personally have benefited from them).<br>
My mother is a Prosaic and Ritalin televangelist.  She's always trying<br>
to prescribe them to anyone she meets.  Thank goodness she is no<br>
longer a Valium queen.  The list goes on and on.  From pacemaker<br>
implants to nicotine patches, humankind is already on the road.<br>
=20<br>
While I dream about physical enhancements that will eventually<br>
change the course of human evolution, or rescue us from the<br>
devolution I believe has already begun, I think the first priority<br>
should be those devices and pharmacological substances that might<br>
extend our life-spans.  Exciting research is underway on the Telemerese<br>
magic bullet.  Tremendous research is going on to find mechanical<br>
replacements for our organs.  These are the efforts that will<br>
eventually make our transhuman dreams real.<br>
=20<br>
I'm looking for a lay working group, of bio-medical engineers and<br>
practical theorists, to discuss the current state of the art in<br>
artificial organ development, and to be a springboard for new ideas.<br>
I agree with the recent comments by Natasha Vita More, this group=20<br>
if full of highly intelligent people all going down their own paths<br>
with zeal.  Surely, practical (and marketable) ideas can find their<br>
birth here.<br>
=20<br>
Sociologically humanity will accept and embrace small steps where<br>
large ones would be feared.  Should I come from the operating room<br>
as a Borg, I fully expect to be stoned to death on a street corner.<br>
If I instead, get a second or third heart, no one will care.  If I<br>
get an artificial gill tucked neatly inside my Henley, no one will<br>
be the wiser.<br>
=20<br>
As I can think of no enhancement that could possibly make Natasha<br>
more perfect than she already is, I will concentrate my efforts<br>
on the one defeatable enemy...Death.<br>
