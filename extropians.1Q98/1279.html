<i>&gt; The human body is really not designed to process a lot of meat with the</i><br>

<i>&gt; limiting (or eliminating) your meat intake and eating low fat vegetarian</i><br>

<p>
Or you can hunt for your meat, and eat healthy protein, as well as be honest<br>
and ethical about it, rather than depend on a guy in a slaughter house to<br>
carry your karma for you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Frankly, I do not care what anyone on this list eats, but you do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to eat meat.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, I would question the idea (expressed by Max More) that we would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have more food on the market if we didn't eat meat. There are three main</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons some people do not have enough to eat:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. They don't have money to buy food</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2. Political interference in agricultural production.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3. War.</i><br>
<p>
Also : 4. Distribution inefficiencies. This is actually the biggest cause of<br>
wasted food. Even the American system which is from what I've heard the most<br>
efficient food distribution system in the world, waste and spoilage accounts<br>
for up to 40% of all food 'consumption'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My food buying habits will change none of these factors. Just because I</i><br>
<i>&gt; stop eating meat, it does not follow that more grain will now go to feed</i><br>
<i>&gt; a starving child in Africa. Almost certainly, total grain production</i><br>
<i>&gt; would just decrease in response to decreased demand.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly, or because you dont eat meat, the price of meat will go down a<br>
minute fraction, making it more affordable for others to buy more....<br>
