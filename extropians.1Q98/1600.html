<p>
I only mentioned "Mirror Worlds" once, don't get all hung-up on it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I just linked from Amazon to UPS to track my book</i><br>
<i>&gt; order and saw that the package was scanned in my</i><br>
<i>&gt; local post office this morning.  This is useful</i><br>
<i>&gt; information but is supported by strictly commercial</i><br>
<i>&gt; interests and it is not available to everyone,</i><br>
<i>&gt; besides, who else would care?</i><br>
<p>
Exactly, it's a lot easier just to dump that information somewhere<br>
than it is to secure it, so why not?  Besides, that information isn't<br>
about you it's about the package.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [snip] When I purchased</i><br>
<i>&gt; my groceries, the company recorded the scanned</i><br>
<i>&gt; information in a private database, which they will</i><br>
<i>&gt; aggregate with millions of other transactions and</i><br>
<i>&gt; sell as purchasing trends information back to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; consumer products companies - they're not about to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make this data freely available.</i><br>
<p>
Again, that information isn't about you it's about the company.  Make<br>
your own records freely available and nobody can make money from<br>
unsolicited information.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Eventually, every single thing you do will be stored on the network.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why and where?  It's one thing to have 'everything'</i><br>
<i>&gt; being transmitted over 'The Net', it's quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; something else again to have everything *stored*</i><br>
<i>&gt; somewhere that anyone can access.</i><br>
<p>
Well any form of computer storage is likely to be accessible, we're<br>
talking about the effects of a global distributed network.  If you<br>
can't think of any advantages that you would get out of having your<br>
lifes information stored on computer then you lack imagination.  And<br>
what about it being machine-readable and linked to all other<br>
information?  Wouldn't that make your life a little easier to<br>
organise?  And it doesn't have to be all input (your actions creating<br>
meta on the network) it can be output (the network creating meta<br>
information in the real world.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The only thing I</i><br>
<i>&gt; can see that would make Gelernter's 'ideal' a reality</i><br>
<i>&gt; is for a world government to mandate that all</i><br>
<i>&gt; transactions and transmissions by stored centrally -</i><br>
<i>&gt; just think of all the 'optimizing' 'mechanism design'</i><br>
<i>&gt; policies the central planners could then dream up!</i><br>
<p>
I wasn't preaching Gelernter's ideal (I just gave the web address!) <br>
Thus I don't care what would make it a reality, I was predicting a<br>
trend, the word "mirror" happened to fit what I was talking about.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the other hand, read Greg Bear's novel SLANT for</i><br>
<i>&gt; some ideas on who might have commercial interests in</i><br>
<i>&gt; tracking all the urinalysis samples collected by</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent toilets attached to the Net.</i><br>
<p>
Most information would be collected for personal use.<br>
