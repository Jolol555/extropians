<i>&gt; From: Anders Sandberg &lt;asa@nada.kth.se&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, some kind of "responsibility Turing test" might be needed. Maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt; it could consist of several scenarios the requester is confronted</i><br>
<i>&gt; with, and its actions are studied, especially when asked to predict or</i><br>
<i>&gt; extend the scenario.</i><br>
<p>
While the Turing test is fairly safe from cheating, a responsibility<br>
test carried out like a Turing test would be very susceptible to it.<br>
You would not know whether the persons being tested tell you what they<br>
believe or simply what you want to hear.<br>
<p>
When AI systems will be available, you will of course have the tools<br>
to read their whole minds directly, which would solve the problem above,<br>
but this method would violate their rights.<br>
<p>
Moreover, a responsibility test performed today would not give you any<br>
certainty that the person would not turn bad in a year or so because of<br>
certain influences.<br>
<p>
Finally, if such a test came into existence, who would define what<br>
would be ethically acceptable and who would assure that the rules of<br>
the test would be adapted according to changes in the ethical standard?<br>
Would it even be possible for the test not to lag behind the ethical<br>
standard?<br>
