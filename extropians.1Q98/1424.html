<p>
OK.<br>
<p>
This is not a 'popular' case to argue (civil liberties seldom are).<br>
<p>
There's an academic study, 'Child Loving' written by (ISTR) William <br>
Kinkaid [publ. RKP].  It attracted a lot of flack in the reviews -- I <br>
haven't read it.<br>
<p>
<p>
Let's look at this seriously.<br>
<p>
Firstly, at a methodological level:  (Pardon my French!)<br>
<p>
<p>
Following Alfred Tarski, we can say:<br>
<p>
"The statement 'Les pedophiles sont particulierement dangereuse aux les <br>
membres de public' is thrue if -- and only if - paedophiles are, in fact, <br>
particularly dangerous to members of the public."   Ironically, such <br>
relationships are known in French as 'Special friendships.'  There's a <br>
novel of that name, by Roger de Peyrefitte, which is on this topic.  No <br>
sex in it, BTW.<br>
<p>
<p>
We do not have a good statistical basis for knowing how many members of <br>
the population are 'paedophiles.'  The American Academic Hypertext <br>
Encyclopaedia by Grolier [1993] describes people who find pre-pubescent <br>
children sexually attractive.  But consider: such preferences are not <br>
binary.  They range from being completely erotically indifferent to <br>
pre-pubescent children, through to finding them (or some of them -- but <br>
which? One?  All of them?) sexually _irresistable_.<br>
<p>
<p>
Sexual attraction can only properly apply to a context of reproductive <br>
acts. So we're not dealing with 'sexuality' at all -- pre-pubescent <br>
girls cannot reproduce, and boys and men cannot reproduce at all, except <br>
in conjunction with fertile females.<br>
<p>
So we're really considering unilateral eroticism -- an internally <br>
experienced erotic attraction, which ranges from (say) zero to a hundred <br>
percent -- we have no _metric_ for it, anyway -- and reciprocated erotic <br>
interactions.<br>
<p>
But erotic feelings are internally-experienced 'World II' phenomena -- <br>
again, there is no external (or internal) metric.  And they can therefore <br>
have _no impact whatsoever on other people_ (except insofar as other <br>
people can sense them at some tacit level).<br>
<p>
Insofar as pre-pubescent children really have no capacity -- knowledge and <br>
experience -- of and for for erotic arousal, they can hardly either sense <br>
it in other people, or understand it either.<br>
<p>
So we just don't know.  The positivist assertion must therefore be false.<br>
<p>
But is it perhaps objectively true, all unbeknownst to us?<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
Cut to the chase.<br>
<p>
<p>
People are understandably very concerned about strangers who forcibly <br>
inflict unwanted physical assaults (of varying degrees of severity) on <br>
children who never sought out such behaviour.  But this is very rare -- in <br>
the case of grave genital or anal assaults.  <br>
<p>
Insofar as grave physical abuse by strangers _does_ occur, it <br>
predominantly occurs in situations where the children are deprived of <br>
liberty -- i.e. in childrens' 'homes' and schools.  There is much <br>
empirical evidence for this.  Vastly more grave assaults on children <br>
(genital and/or anal) occur at the hands of their parents, in the home: <br>
people who have 'legitimate' power over them.<br>
<p>
In almost all cases, these assaults can actually be completely prevented <br>
and stopped, and children need no longer suffer, or -- like Jonbenet Ramsey, <br>
aged 6, be hideously tortured and then murdered.<br>
<p>
Either one or other of her parents killed her, or -- vastly more probable <br>
-- it was a carefully staged 'demonstration' killing, carried out by paid <br>
psychopaths.  The investigating authorities are not making it very easy to <br>
discover the facts in this matter.<br>
<p>
Asking 'What powerful people has John Ramsey upset?' might prove a <br>
most fruitful line of inquiry.  The 'moral panic' brigade are obvious <br>
candidates -- his daughter was intelligent, good-looking and clearly <br>
enjoyed appearing before the public.  Hateful, to some minds...<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
        The real-world solution is simple:  equip all children with <br>
personalized miniature radio 'search-and-rescue' beacons, to be activated <br>
in crisis situations and emitting a personalized radio alarm signal,  This <br>
can be instantly picked up, the source location triangulated and given <br>
Global Positioning Coordinates, and appropriate rescue services sent to <br>
the scene immediately, by the fastest possible means.<br>
<p>
<p>
        The small units can be worn as pendants, bracelets, on a belt.  <br>
Anywhere accessible to the child should they be in a crisis situation.  <br>
Training children to use them is simple. They're very cheap to manufacture. <br>
Come to think of it, we could all do with these -- it results in <br>
incident-driven policing at the behest of the person under threat. This <br>
would be most fruitful in reconfiguring policing to be a system of <br>
delegated self-defence, rather than a means of social control operated by <br>
the governing hierarchical authorities.<br>
<p>
Microlert was offering such a service for US $30 a year in California, in <br>
the Seventies.  <br>
<p>
Advocates of authoritarian and violent parenting and schooling (Gillick, <br>
Howard, Shephard) _hate and detest_ this sort of idea, which is now <br>
actually being made available to children under threat within their <br>
homes in America...<br>
<p>
Ask yourself why it is, that the 'authorities' seem to have so little <br>
concern for the phyical, psychological and emotional well-being of each <br>
and every one of us -- children _and_ adults.<br>
<p>
The exaggerated 'AIDS' propaganda backfired on the 'moral' authoritarians, <br>
resulting in a vast proliferation of erotic non-penetrative activity -- <br>
so-called 'safe sex.'<br>
<p>
The social-control freaks are _really pissed off about this failure.  A  <br>
lot of effort and resources went into the scare.<br>
<p>
Stuff called BHT (E321) -- a near-perfectly-safe food preservative and <br>
anti-oxidant -- zaps all lipid-coated viruses it's so far been tesed on, <br>
in 250 mg. oral daily doses. No side-effects, no immunocompromize effects.<br>
<p>
It's generic, and sells for around five bucks a kilo.<br>
<p>
Do a WWW search on 'Fowkes' and 'BHT'<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
The idea of children remaining 'innocent' in the context of modern <br>
tobacco, confectionery and newspaper shops is quite risible, insofar as <br>
there are all that many children incapable of erotic responses left. Go <br>
look at the magazine racks in any shop. Just look at the cover pictures <br>
and text.<br>
<p>
        Orchestrated witch-hunts against mostly harmless and inoffensive <br>
people is much nearer what the 'authorities seem to want to go in for.  <br>
Coercion. Wonder why?<br>
<p>
No civil libertarian should have much of a problem answering that: -- <br>

                       MORE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
I'm hardly any kind of  'paedophile' -- my idea of 'attractive' is the <br>
glorious Olivia Newton-John.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
But I did see my best friend lying in a mortuary, with ice crystals on his <br>
face, stone dead.  He liked emotional involvement with -- and on occasion <br>
mutual erotic play with -- good-looking boys between the ages of twelve <br>
and fourteen.  They seemed to welcome it, AFAIK.  If I'd had any reason to <br>
think that they didn't, he wouldn't have been a friend of mine for a <br>
moment longer.   We were just 20 years old...<br>
<p>
<p>
With me was another good friend with similar inclinations.  He went on to <br>
become a top Royal Navy carrier pilot and a gifted 'TOP GUN' air combat <br>
trainer.  He ceased to have any interest in younger boys as he grew older, <br>
but is still an 'out' gay.<br>
<p>
I have no reason to think that either of them ever did any kind of harm to <br>
anyone.  I don't have friends who are like that.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
One of the parents resented their son's attachment to my best friend, and <br>
'sweated' a 'confession' out of their son... The police were summoned, <br>
and very commendably seemed suprisingly unconcerned, and he was charged <br>
with 'indecent exposure', ISTR.  However, they told him he couldn't expect <br>
to go on 'doing it.'<br>
<p>
All too true.<br>
<p>
<p>
A little later, he was found dead, by his mother and his sister.<br>
