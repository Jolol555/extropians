<i>&gt; Well, I think that the number one goal should be working to maximize</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual human freedoms everywhere. Not just censorship here or womens</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights there. I mean, the ACLU, as much as I hate their damliberal</i><br>
<i>&gt; stance of avoiding protecting the 2nd amendment, I do respect greatly</i><br>
<i>&gt; for their willingness to at least fight for the 1st amendment rights of</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who even directly oppose what most ACLU members stand for. We</i><br>
<i>&gt; should take a similar stance, only with regard to ALL political rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In the US, I think this means we should publicize the 9th Amendment as</i><br>
<i>&gt; much as possible, as that is what gives the most and broadest power to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the people. I kinda look at the 9th as the Curley of the Bill of Rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It never gets the attention or respect it deserves, and its always</i><br>
<i>&gt; getting slapped around by the autocrat, Moe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But in general, we should really emphasize that we don't look at rights</i><br>
<i>&gt; as something that can be treated with a buffet style attitude. Take them</i><br>
<i>&gt; all or take none. BY making this the issue, we paint both sides of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; current political spectrum as extremists, and us as the mainstream that</i><br>
<i>&gt; is for maximizing freedom for the most people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think with a general, but firm message like this, we can attract good</i><br>
<i>&gt; PR, support from flighty and often vacuous celebrities (so what its the</i><br>
<i>&gt; message that counts) who can even understand so basic a concept, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; appeal to the broadest range of people. The technological implications</i><br>
<i>&gt; are implicit and can be soft pedalled. We know that it will get here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What we need to do is prepare the body politic to be receptive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology is a way that is not opressive, and to prevent forces from</i><br>
<i>&gt; using technology to yoke mankind firther into slavery.</i><br>

Okay.  I have a few quibbles here and there, but the main question, the<br>
question I keep returning to, is this:  What makes the organization you<br>
are outlining here *extropian* rather than just fairly conventionally<br>
American libertarian?  Your claim seems to be that the best preparation<br>
for the technological future extropians anticipate is to spread as widely<br>
as possible a respect for rights and liberty in their libertarian<br>
formulations.  This is arguable, and I wouldn't mind seeing the arguments<br>
so long as they didn't veer too much into Basics.  But the thing that is<br>
most relevant to the topic at hand is that the organization you are<br>
outlining would be pretty indistinguishable from a libertarian<br>
organization and I can't see why it wouldn't represent an unecessary<br>
duplication of services.  Is there a uniquely *extropian* agenda and space<br>
of activism that remains to be filled, one that might actually deserve the<br>
moniker "the extropian *movement*"?  Best, Dale<br>
