<p>
Okay...&gt;&gt; let us make a directed marketing... but without putting down the<br>
global level of discussions...<br>
I say that 'cause the list is not closed to them... the great majority<br>
simply does not get interested in things that involve a deeper  or more<br>
serious menthal work... with some exceptions, f.ex. the gals in this list...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;One good way, I think, would be to capitalize on the women we </i><br>
<i>&gt;already have (sorry for this way of phrasing it...). I mean, there </i><br>
<i>&gt;are female contributors to this list, for example, who could serve as </i><br>
<i>&gt;superb role models -- sucessful, strong, creative, confident. It </i><br>
<i>&gt;is much easier to assimilate a philosophy if there is a person you </i><br>
<i>&gt;admire who embodies it.</i><br>
<p>
I, IMHO, agree....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And it would show that transhumanism is not </i><br>
<i>&gt;just abstract words but also something that can be _lived_.</i><br>
<p>
I, IMHO, disagree...just  'cause:<br>
<p>
1--&gt;  Transhumanism IS NOT 'just abstract words'... Possibly it shoud de<br>
better say: more 'intelectually accessible'... what is diff. from abstract...<br>
<p>
2--&gt;  The presence of women is indifferent to the abstraction or<br>
concreteness level of the discussions (to be discussed...)... it may be<br>
important just to having more the simple presence of theirs... what is<br>
always a pleasure...<br>
<p>
3--&gt;  The great majority of women must be humbler... and accept better the<br>
almost unavoidable (and always positive) critics that will be done to their<br>
opinions, AS are done to any other person... be male or female... ( when<br>
I'm talking about exact sciences, I WILL NOT anyway week a concept just<br>
because I will transmit it to a woman... Instead, I would be considering<br>
her less capable than she really is...&gt;&gt;&gt; Mr T. A. Edson said that a<br>
genious is 10% of inspiration and 90% of transpiration... in other words<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; the menthal capabilities must also be exercised...not just the butt and</i><br>
the legs -  what, in particular, attract me v'ry much...WOOW.. )<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It might also be true that there are some issues which are more </i><br>
<i>&gt;"male" and some that are more "female". Perhaps, on average, men are </i><br>
<i>&gt;comparatively more interested in molecular nanotechnology and women </i><br>
<i>&gt;in, say, new forms of interpersonal relations. If that is so, then </i><br>
<i>&gt;one could try to give more coverage to these "female" topics. (Or </i><br>
<i>&gt;prehaps, I am just prejudiced.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Well, well... do not know... <br>
I also participate in a discussion list named 'european sociologists'<br>
&lt;european-sociologist@mailbase.ac.uk&gt;...and if there are not more men, they<br>
are tied in number... Men, in general, naturally get well succeded in what<br>
they want to... women too, when get ineterested in... ( their formation<br>
unconsciously leads, in general, to accomodation and existencial<br>
ociousness... When there is necessary a real result so that the bridge<br>
really DO NOT fall... they call a man... unless they are woken up to<br>
this... got it up ???) <br>
The women should do their work and bring such topics to discussion... I<br>
really hate some of theirs's  tendency of ALWAYS being just 'laid with legs<br>
opened' waiting for us to do something... They also know how to do a lot of<br>
movements and 'jobs' tooo... hehehe... If the related topics survive in the<br>
natural intellectual process... When my product is good and I am interested<br>
in selling it, I will have to fight for it...<br>
( I am just being intentionally too rigid... F.ex: If they - in general -<br>
were really more independent, an idiot model whose name  I do not remember<br>
now, would not be trying to process that guy ( if I'm not wrong, that who<br>
died with  Dy...), just because 'he promised to marry her' and did not do<br>
that..  fuck her!!! go her learn how to get money honestly !!! and worse...<br>
The Law just permits such ridiculousnesses... )<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;................</i><br>
<i>&gt;The goal is to increase the outreach to include extropians and also </i><br>
<i>&gt;those transhumanists who do not accept all features of extropian </i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanism. One important goal is to bring transhumanism to </i><br>
<i>&gt;academic respectability</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Great!  &gt;&gt;&gt; and there will be really necessary a lot of marketing !!!!<br>
Because in a wider level, folks must be conducted to the 'right direction',<br>
which IS NOT necessarily the workless OR EASIER one...   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;What I would like to contribute on, is the translation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; all these idea's, opinions and research to the majority.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;...which is another main goal, perhaps the most important one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
YES !!!! LET US TRY TO HELP  YOU (US) .... COUNT ON ME...<br>

PS1: Our female partners have still a lot to learn... and evolute... I'm<br>
not a machist anyway... I just observe and feel them deeper... And, if I<br>
were an emmotional, would also feel lots of times intellectually alone when<br>
searching for female's company... The solution is almost always 'to adapt'<br>
the level(s) of discussion... A personal obs.: With my actual wife ( the<br>
3rd, legally) there is not such problem: She was one of my students....and<br>
was approved on my battery of tests... hehehe...<br>
