I would suggest you look at the concept of a "PT" (Perpetual Tourist,<br>
Post Taxpayer, etc.) There are many references on the net and texts. The<br>
plan is to divide your life into components so that one state does not<br>
"control" you. In practice you would hold a passport of convenience or<br>
two, work in or out of another tax free haven, bank in another,  hold<br>
your assets again in another and live where you wish but not long enough<br>
to be considered a resident there. US Citizens with significant assets<br>
would need to take great care and time to successfully accomplish this.<br>
Practically speaking you would need to have a portable profession and<br>
the infrastructure is expensive so the payback period to recover those<br>
costs could be years.<br>
While I personally know the PT structure is viable and  accomplished  I<br>
also know many more try than succeed.<br>
