One case against Pinker's 'explanations' of How the<br>
Mind Works is made in a London debate from January<br>
between Pinker and neurobiologist Steven Rose which<br>
is transcribed at<br>
<a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker_rose/pinker_rose_p1.html">http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker_rose/pinker_rose_p1.html</a><br>
<p>
The essence of Rose's claim is: "The mistake that<br>
evolutionary psychology makes in this reverse<br>
engineering discussion is constantly to mistake<br>
metaphor and analogy for homology, and draw what I<br>
regard as both horrendous scientific and horrendous<br>
political conclusions from it.... Human life, human<br>
society, is much much richer than these travesties.<br>
And I do insist that what you [Pinker] offer is a<br>
Flintstone type travesty of life today."<br>
<p>
Rose also refers to many of these reverse engineering<br>
conclusions as "Just-So Stories".<br>
<p>
I think Pinker's most useful contribution is the<br>
"organs of computation" notion itself.  As Pinker put<br>
it in his 9701 interview with John Brockman at<br>
<a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker/pinker_p3.html">http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker/pinker_p3.html</a><br>
<p>
"I also believe that the mind is not made of Spam -<br>
it has a complex, heterogeneous structure. It is<br>
composed of mental organs that are specialized to do<br>
different things ... That puts me in agreement with<br>
Chomsky and against many neural network modelers, who<br>
hope that a single kind of neural network, if<br>
suitably trained, can accomplish every mental feat<br>
that we do." <br>
<p>
While this is somewhat of a 'strawman', it's still a<br>
useful point to keep in mind.  As Pinker puts it in<br>
the 9801 debate with Rose: "My approach is most<br>
definitely not reductionist in the bad sense of<br>
trying to explain everything in terms of the smallest<br>
units of analysis".<br>
<p>
However, "organs of COGNITION" might be a better term<br>
because many psychologists and biologists would<br>
dispute that what the brain does is anything like<br>
computation.  Pinker acknowledges this, but he still<br>
insists that the brain creates 'representations' of<br>
the outside world.  There is, however, MUCH dispute<br>
about this claim. (Psyche-D archives are FULL of this<br>
subject).<br>
<p>
I also find that Pinker is fairly arrogant when he<br>
declares: "I find it hard to escape the feeling that<br>
much of Professor Rose's approach just REDESCRIBES<br>
standard biology with new jargon: words like<br>
'autopoiesis' and 'homeodynamics' and<br>
'self-construction'".  This is NOT 'new' jargon. <br>
Maturana &amp; Varela's  theory of autopoiesis has been<br>
around since the 60's and grew out of the cybernetics<br>
work from much earlier, particularly by Heinz von<br>
Foerster at the University of Illinois Biological<br>
Computing Lab.  As Steven Rose claims, these theories<br>
offer "a deeper and a richer materialism than Steve<br>
[Pinker] is in his account.  It's a materialism that<br>
takes account of dynamism, and isn't statically<br>
frozen in the past".<br>
<p>
Besides the recent Rose debate, there are many other<br>
responses to Pinker available online at<br>
<a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/index.cgi?OPTION=VIEW">http://www.edge.org/discourse/index.cgi?OPTION=VIEW</a>&amp;THREAD=steven-pinker/1-15-97/talk<br>
<p>
In the final comments there, Arnold Trehub concludes:<br>
"Steven Pinker and Steven Quartz (together with<br>
Terrence Sejnowski) [Radical Constructivism] have<br>
staked their opposing claims near the extremes of the<br>
nature-nurture continuum.... But I wonder how soundly<br>
each of them can argue against the more credible view<br>
that *innate domain-specific brain mechanisms* and<br>
*learning-dependent brain structures* are *together<br>
indespensible* for the creation of the mature human<br>
mind."<br>
<p>
Some may complain about the quality of much stuff<br>
posted on the Web; but, I'm more concerned when<br>
people want to learn about a subject outside of their<br>
profession and just pick one or two books by a few<br>
notable authors and base most of their conclusions on<br>
those.  Thus, by relying on, for example, the<br>
Extropian reading list, one could end up being<br>
familiar with Richard Dawkins, Paul Churchland, and,<br>
now, Steven Pinker, without being aware that these<br>
researchers are considered to lie at extreme ends of<br>
the spectrum by many other researchers in their<br>
respective fields.<br>
