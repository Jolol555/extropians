Hi,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If any of you were watching the Discovery Channel program called "Shoot</i><br>
<i>&gt; NOT to Kill" last night, you'd notice a device I had developed back in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the late 80's is now being bandied about as a law enforcement tool. They</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussed the use of short range contact and focussed beam EMP weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt; to easily stop automobiles. I had built a device exactly like they</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussed and demonstrated back in '89 and used it successfully against</i><br>
<i>&gt; police trying to stop me for speeding. It shot a focussed EMP pulse in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cone behind my vehicle to a range of about 150 feet that would toast the</i><br>
<i>&gt; engine control chips of a pursuing vehicle....</i><br>
<p>
how often were you able to use this device?  did the police ever find out?<br>
If so, what did they do?<br>
<p>
While being fascinated by such devioces, I'm even more fascinated by their<br>
active use, as most of the people I know just put up with the police like<br>
good little citizens (including me, generally).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course, no mention was made of the origin of this device, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sort of application that ne'er-do-wells like myself could make of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology....</i><br>
<p>
Well, true.<br>
<p>
Dwayne.<br>
