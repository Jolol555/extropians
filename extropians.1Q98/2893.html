<i>&gt;Exactly why is it monstrous for immature teenage mothers to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;encouraged to put their babies up for adoption where they can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;raised in two parent homes with more mature people? I think it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;idiotic for a teenage girl to think she is doing the best thing</i><br>
<i>&gt;for her child (or herself) by trying to raise it without a father.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Our prisons are filled with kids who come from single parent</i><br>
<i>&gt;homes.Check the statistics. To encourage single teen mothers to</i><br>
<i>&gt;keep their kids is bad social policy.</i><br>

<i>&gt;Sounds like a good idea to me too; I can't imagine why anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;would think that offering young mothers this option was a bad</i><br>
<i>&gt;thing in any way.  Now I do understand why some people would</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a problem with the "pregnancy counseling clinics" set up</i><br>
<i>&gt;by fundies that only counsel what the church approves of--that</i><br>
<i>&gt;is being less than honest.  But if such an organization clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt;acknowledges its religious affiliation, more power to them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's not as if clinics like Planned Parenthood don't also have</i><br>
<i>&gt;a strong religious bias--though pragmatism isn't generally</i><br>
<i>&gt;recognized as the religious doctrine it is.</i><br>
<p>
DEF &lt;exploit&gt;  2. to make unethical use of for ones own profit.<br>
<p>
The problem is that absolutely no concern is for the mother, their<br>
only purpose is to get their hands on the baby. the prospective<br>
adoptive parents are well-to-do contributers to the church.<br>
<p>
Unethical,explotative, and IMMHO monstrous.<br>
<p>
As I've already pointed out, the refusal of so called pro-life<br>
groups to support birth control points clearly at their primary<br>
goal.<br>
<p>
<p>
Women are not property, nor are they "Axolotl tanks".<br>
