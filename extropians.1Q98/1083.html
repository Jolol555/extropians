<i>&gt; From:          anduril@cix.compulink.co.uk (Tony Hollick)</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;       John K Clark writes eloquently, and well:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; |If I want to sell something, and you want to buy, we agree on a price and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |make the exchange, end of story. It's understandable to both of us, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; |simple, it's elegant, it works. A system that was as simple as the market and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |worked as well, would have been found by now, and as I have not heard any</i><br>
<i>&gt; |reports of this interesting development, leads me to believe that it does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; |exist. A protocol that needs 10 years of super computer time before I can buy</i><br>
<i>&gt; |a can od beer is not better than the market, regardless of what it's other</i><br>
<i>&gt; |virtues may be.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;       This is true, but it also completely begs the question of how </i><br>
<i>&gt;       _either_ of you come to own anything in the first place.  No-one has </i><br>
<i>&gt;       ever provided a satisfying explanation of how a person comes to </i><br>
<i>&gt;       'own' a given piece of land from a state of nature.  The </i><br>
<i>&gt;       'labour-mixing' argument doesn't hold water.  Why is your labour not </i><br>
<i>&gt;       just wasted effort?  The 'resources-mixing' argument begs the first </i><br>
<i>&gt;       question, and fails Nozick's test of why -- if you pour a can of </i><br>
<i>&gt;       beer into the Pacific -- you haven't just wasted 'your' beer, </i><br>
<i>&gt;       instead of acquiring a part-share in the Pacific!  &gt;:-}</i><br>
<p>
Given the amply-demonstrated advantages of a system of individual <br>
ownership over all the alternatives man has yet come up with, the <br>
only pragmatic reason for wondering about the origin of ownership is <br>
to assist in devising reasonable means of transferring all <br>
currently-unowned resources to individuals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       There is a legal maxim: "Non Dat Quod Non Habet" (you cannot give </i><br>
<i>&gt;       what you do not have).  97% of American land is owned by around 3% </i><br>
<i>&gt;       of the population, or so I understand.</i><br>
<p>
I can easily prove that you understand incorrectly.<br>
<p>
That leaves only 3% of the land owned by anyone other than those 3% <br>
of the population.<br>
<p>
Government-owned land in states whose names begin with the letter A, <br>
amounts to more than 3% of the land in the US.  If you restrict <br>
consideration to the 48 contiguous states, you may have to add states <br>
whose names begin with C.<br>
