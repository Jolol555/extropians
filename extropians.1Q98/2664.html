<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can see if someone has read your message using the "return receipt</i><br>

And using Netscape's browser, if you have your security flags set, you are always<br>
prompted before intrusive javascript, cookies, or other privacy and security<br>
penetrating actions are taken.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Who needs more than 7-bit to exchange content? The only drawback is German</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; umlauts and other special characters, which I would have executed once and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for all about 20 years ago anyway. Unicode may offer some new possibilities</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; here, but HTML for a mailing list is really unnecessary. Did it ever occur</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to you that there might still be some people using PINE or stuff like that?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I generally use elm on a linux box, but I'm using my Dad's win95 machine for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bit. So I can currently *see* HTML mail, but I'd rather have the option of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to telnet into my mail server from anywhere and read my mail, than be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to see differing fonts and colours (as if that will make a message more</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligible).</i><br>
<p>
That even ascii based browsers like ALPHABrowser now support HTML email indicates<br>
that even the most primitive interfaces are capable of rising above their origins.<br>
Its people, and their stubborn resistance to change that is the sticking point. As<br>
extropians, we need to get the anti-change meme out of our systems through regular,<br>
habitual purging of obsolete techniques, tools, etc. from our regular use.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd thought that the umlauts in german can be swapped for a following "e"??</i><br>
<p>
Most european accent systems can be replicated in an HTML compatible mail reader by<br>
using tags that specify a standard international character set that is 7 bit, and is<br>
recognised as an alternate font.. Microsoft has several as does DEC. Microsoft<br>
International and DEC Multinational are two that I have come across regularly in<br>
mail data files customers in other countries send me at work for processing. I don't<br>
understand, though, why Germans would use a capital B with a tail as a replacement<br>
for the 'ss' in -strasse ??? Is it a different pronouncement?<br>
