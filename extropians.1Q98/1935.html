I have similar reservations as to putting a large investment into a<br>
tropical island.  Many of the tropical islands have very little elevation<br>
above sea level.  Any number of natural occurences (large storm surge,<br>
tsunami, oceanic meteor impact) could have devastating consequences.<br>
Additionally, most of the smaller islands are not much more than<br>
sand-logged coral reefs with only marginally substantial foundations.<br>
While fine for a tropical bungalow, I would be more hesitant to build a<br>
really large structure on top of it.  Tropical islands with solid volcanic<br>
or tectonic origins *are* plentiful, but tend to be significantly larger<br>
(i.e. expensive) than their more affordable and smaller reef-based brethren.<br>
<p>
This is why I would seriously consider the Alaskan/Canadian coastal<br>
islands.  These islands are built of some of the oldest, hardest rock*(see<br>
below) on the planet, and many are more than 1000 feet in elevation.<br>
Additionally, this is one of the calmest coastlines on the Pacific Ocean;<br>
the water is *glassy*.  Plenty of fresh water, lots of timber, all the<br>
seafood you can catch/eat, and a very mild climate (similar to Washington<br>
state).  I initially visited the area only after my parents moved there<br>
(for a scant two years) and immediately fell in love with the place.  <br>
<p>
Of more interest to many on this list is that there is no practical force<br>
of law in these areas.  Local laws are, for all intents and purposes,<br>
absolute.  Visiting the local communities is a real-life demonstration of<br>
how this can be very good or very bad, depending on the constitution of the<br>
particular community.  In areas where strong self-discipline is the social<br>
norm, these islands are nearly a libertarian mecca; you can do whatever you<br>
want as long as you don't harm anyone else.  However, there are some<br>
islands that are essentially malevolent oligarchies/dictatorships, with all<br>
the usual bad things associated.  As an odd twist to the normal state of<br>
affairs, the Alaskan government has more money than it knows what to do<br>
with (oil revenues; there are no taxes in Alaska) and will gladly fund all<br>
sorts of schools/ventures/projects just to spend it for the benefit of<br>
improving the image of the state.  One of their latest greatest projects is<br>
to spend their excess funds on wiring the entire state with fiber and<br>
high-speed switches in the attempt to turn Alaska into something resembling<br>
a high-tech state (even if they *are* missing the tech people).  Quite<br>
frankly, there is a decent possibility that Alaska would sell you an island<br>
"pennies on the dollar" if you promised to bring a whole lot of high-tech<br>
expertise with you.  As I said, the southern coastal islands are *not* bad<br>
places to live, if a bit underdeveloped.<br>
<p>
If I was to consider a permanent location for an Extropian country (per<br>
se), this would be my best choice based on what I know.<br>
<p>
<p>
*INTERESTING ASIDE:  In this region is an island known as Annette Island<br>
(385 km^2) that contains small hill of yellow rock that is much older than<br>
the very old volcanic rock that surrounds it.  In fact, this little hill is<br>
one of the oldest rocks known.  The interesting thing is that this rock is<br>
also one of the toughest substances known.  Diamond is the only known<br>
substance that can cut this rock without rapidly destroying the blade of<br>
the cutting tool.  This rock eats tungsten carbide/nitride alloys for<br>
lunch.  Once considered to be an asset worthy of export, the cost of<br>
cutting it proved to be too high to make the extremely hard rock a<br>
commercially viable building material.<br>
