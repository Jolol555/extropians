Why can’t I call my broker today and tell him to sell 100 shares in my<br>
future income stream? Economics tells us the problem is information and<br>
incentives. Potential investors in my human capital don’t have enough<br>
information about my potential income, and it is too costly to monitor my<br>
activities to make sure that I will work hard and pay the dividends on<br>
time and in full.<br>
<p>
As tracking, communication, and monitoring technologies continue to<br>
develop, these problems may be overcome and a human capital market<br>
develop. People would be interested to sell their human capital to<br>
diversify their investment portfolio or because they have a high discount<br>
rate for the future. While this should make the economy more efficient and<br>
everyone better off, it could also increase the inequality of wealth in<br>
society. One reason the level of inequality in our society now is not<br>
higher is that the government subsides and forces self-investment in the<br>
form of education, and the market does not allow people to sell off that<br>
investment. If people are able to sell their human capital, then some<br>
might be tempted to trade an expensive lifestyle now for poverty in the<br>
future. (In some sense they can already do that with credit cards, but an<br>
efficient human capital market would allow them to do it to a much greater<br>
extent.)<br>
<p>
One reason extropians might be interested in the development of a human<br>
capital market, besides that it give people choices they didn’t have<br>
before, is that it may allow greater investment in human capital in a<br>
scenario where this is especially risky. For example, suppose people<br>
expect that there is an even chance of cheap AIs developing in the next<br>
ten years. If that happens they will lose a lot of their income potential<br>
as the AIs compete with humans in the labor market. If a human capital<br>
market did not exist, this would lead people to substantially reduce<br>
education and other forms of human capital investment in order to<br>
diversify into (say) AI company stocks or physical resources. A human<br>
capital market would allow the level of human capital investment to stay<br>
at more efficient levels (although it would still be lower than if there<br>
was no chance of AIs developing).<br>
