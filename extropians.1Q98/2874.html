<i>        &gt;Cuba, besides Chile, is still one of the healthiest nations in Latin        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;America. I have posted statistics on this before, but you have         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;rejected them because they were obviously from too "liberal" sources         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;(United Nations and such). By saying that something is "totally </i><br>
<i>        &gt;false", however, and thereby making yourself the source for your </i><br>
<i>        &gt;claims, you don't do much to refute my statements. Actually, you, </i><br>
<i>        &gt;John Clark and others have not posted a single source, a single </i><br>
<i>        &gt;document to support your claims. True believers, as John said </i><br>
<i>        &gt;(referring to me).</i><br>
<p>
         <br>
I was going to just ignore our friend Erik The Red because I've learned that <br>
logic no longer plays a part in his world view so there is little to say, <br>
but my name was mentioned and for the benefit of others I have to say a few  <br>
things. Eric, we talked about all this in private mail months ago, the reason  <br>
nobody takes your statistics seriously, impressive though they look with all <br>
those decimal places, is that 92.3876256211% of the statistics  coming out of <br>
a police state are wrong.<br>
<p>
The only figures I would believe coming out of Cuba would be things like  <br>
imports and exports and immigration and emigration, things that can be  <br>
confirmed by third parties, otherwise it's just so much verbiage. Castro <br>
tells his subjects to think only happy thoughts, thoughts that make him look <br>
good, so can you conceive of one reason why his statistics would have the<br>
slightest relationship to reality? If infant mortality was terrible he would <br>
say it was good, if it was good he'd say it was great, if it was great he'd <br>
say no child has ever died in Cuba since he took power.    <br>
 <br>
So let's look at how people vote with their feet, it's exclusively one way,  <br>
all out of Cuba. A strange thing to happen in a wealthy happy land.  <br>
Since Castro took power millions of people, close to 25% of the population,  <br>
have abandoned Cuba,  and the didn't go to the USSR, they went to a  <br>
capitalistic country. Think about it, they abandoned everything they had and <br>
made a very risky voyage across the open sea in a flimsy raft to a country <br>
with different customs and a different language. They wouldn't do that unless <br>
they were desperate, they wouldn't do that unless they hated Castro with an <br>
intensity I can hardly imagine.<br>
<p>
What about the only other economic statistic Castro can't control, trade?  <br>
Well, there isn't much of it. If Cuba had something that the rest of the <br>
world wanted there would be lots of trade and the US government would not be <br>
able to stop it, but all it has to offer is cigars and a little sugar.  <br>
For more than 20 years the USSR bought all of Cuba's sugar at a price 40% <br>
greater than the world market price to help prop up Castro. It wasn't enough.<br>
<p>
Today Castro is crying that few companies want to invest in his country, but <br>
there are very good reasons why a sane company would think long and hard   <br>
before it made a large investment in Cuba. When Castro came to power he  <br>
nationalized all foreign operations, he stole every bit of it and paid  <br>
absolutely nothing to anyone for it. If he did it once he can do it again. <br>
Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.<br>
  <br>
By the way, Cuba may be destitute now but it wasn't always that way. Castro  <br>
did not inherit a poor country, in 1959 it had the third highest standard of  <br>
living in the western hemisphere, only the USA and Canada were higher. The <br>
fact that for a few days in 1962 Castro brought the human race closer to <br>
the brink of extinction than anytime in the last ten thousand years does not <br>
increase my admiration of him.<br>
             <br>

<i>        &gt;The best definition of freedom probably comes from the </i><br>
<i>        &gt;anarcho-socialists.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Anarcho-socialists, is that anything like jumbo shrimp?  "We want no  <br>
government and we want the government to take your money so it can <br>
distribute it fairly, we want no government but we want the government to <br>
decide what is  fair and what is not."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Not being oppressed by power structures while, at the same time,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;helping to advance evolution. [...]  Evolution of humanity. Through         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;progress. By spreading information.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not interested in natural Evolution except as a historic relic that <br>
explains how we got here, it's much too slow and stupid for my taste. <br>
Evolution had its shot at making intelligence, now it's our turn.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Such a freedom is entirely impossible in a "free market".</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The sad thing is that you not only oppose a free market in money and goods <br>
but also ideas.<br>
