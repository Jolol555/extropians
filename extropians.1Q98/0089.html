Um, no.  Someone can exploit information in a harmful way without <br>
ever revealing that fact -- and it can be quite obvious that some one <br>
of several hundred people is exploiting information, but not <br>
sufficiently obvious *which* one to justify scanning *any* of them.<br>
<p>
Here are the rules under which I would consider allowing such a <br>
device:<br>
<p>
(1) for criminal investigations only, and only after all "victimless <br>
crime" laws have been eliminated.<br>
<p>
(2) only by consent of the person to be monitored, and only in the <br>
presence of an attorney.<br>
<p>
(3) the questions will be strictly yes/no.<br>
<p>
(4) the person to be monitored shall be provided a list of questions, <br>
and time to examine the list.  In the absence of this, the person <br>
cannot give meaningful consent.<br>
<p>
(5) asking a question not on the list shall be considered a violation <br>
of privacy of such severity that the person thus invaded may be <br>
awarded a settlement without proof of actual damage -- and it shall <br>
be considered that the person asking the question *and* the <br>
enforcement body he/she represents are *each* liable in *full* for <br>
this violation.<br>
<p>
(6) use of the monitoring device without the consent of the subject <br>
shall be, in addition to a civilly actionable violation of privacy as <br>
under (5), a felony.  In the case of an allegation of a violation of <br>
this clause, if the appropriate executive agency declines to <br>
prosecute, any citizen may prosecute.<br>

US$500 fee for receipt of unsolicited commercial email. USC 47.5.II.227<br>
