<i>&gt; way to interpret a question like "are you the same person you were a</i><br>

<p>
I don't think using "is" in an asymmetric way is necessarily confusing. We<br>
handle sentences like "a penguin is a bird, but a bird is not necessarily<br>
a penguin" without too much trouble. The reason I use "is" is that we<br>
often hear questions like "is an upload of me really me?" from people who<br>
have no clear idea of what "is" means in that context. I am suggesting<br>
such a meaning.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The larger problem is that this seems to over-emphasize the importance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; memory.  Our memories are important, but it seems to me that identity</i><br>
<i>&gt; requires more than just remembering.  If my mind were invaded tomorrow and</i><br>
<i>&gt; rearranged so that my motivations, beliefs, and desires were completely</i><br>
<i>&gt; different, then I would view the result as a different person even if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; kept all my memories.</i><br>
<p>
What if you read a book that is so persuasive that you change all of your<br>
motivations, beliefs, and desires? Would you say the person who finishes<br>
reading the book is no longer you? Is it really possible to completely<br>
change someone's motivations, beliefs, and desires without touching his<br>
memory?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I also wonder about the gray areas.  I don't remember most days of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; life, so probably on most days I can expect that in the future I won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; remember those days.  This would seem to imply that after a few years</i><br>
<i>&gt; I will no longer exist.  Supposing I am offered the opportunity for an</i><br>
<i>&gt; immortal lifespan, should I refuse it since I won't remember the present</i><br>
<i>&gt; day after some years?  That doesn't seem right.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe you should extend it so that you write A &lt; B to indicate that B</i><br>
<i>&gt; "is" A (e.g. remembers being A), and add as an axiom that A &lt; B and B &lt; C</i><br>
<i>&gt; implies A &lt; C.  This way I stay alive as long as each day I remember the</i><br>
<i>&gt; day before, even if after a while I have completely forgotten today.</i><br>
<p>
I haven't decided whether this more liberal notion of identity is more<br>
attractive. But as a practical matter, if you're offered immortality<br>
today, you'd probably remember the day longer if you accepted than if you<br>
refused.<br>
