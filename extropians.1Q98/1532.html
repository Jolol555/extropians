<p>
Mr. Bailey, in case you didn't realize it, the government coerces you to <br>
pay taxes. You don't pay, they throw you in jail. You resist, they blow <br>
your head off. It's as simple as that. I'm a libertarian. I oppose the <br>
initiation of force, whether by an individual or a collective. <br>
<p>
I doubt if anyone on this list has any objection to people voluntarily <br>
sharing information or resources. What people do with their money and/or <br>
knowledge is their own business. It's the violence of the state many of <br>
us object to and the idea that we should be forced to give our money <br>
away to others. Taxation is just another form of slavery. This is a <br>
moral issue to me and arguments about what taxes are "fair" and whether <br>
Reagan¹s tax policy "worked" (whatever that means) are totally beside <br>
the point. People should pay for the services they want and not be <br>
forced to pay for those they don't want.<br>
<p>
I want zero taxes. Zilch. Zip. As an interim measure, I want everyone's <br>
taxes to go down and the government to shrink. <br>
<p>
We could argue about the economics of chattel slavery, but it's <br>
irrelevant. Slavery is wrong, and has no place in a civilized society. <br>
It took about 100,000 years for people to realize this. I can only hope <br>
people will realize the same about taxation at some point.<br>
<p>
O.W. Holmes once said that taxation is the price we pay for <br>
civilization. He was dead wrong. Taxation is the price we pay for not <br>
having a good enough civilization.  <br>
<p>
As for the philanthropy of the Rockefellers and Bill Gates: fine and <br>
dandy. They are free to give away their money as they see fit. However, <br>
it's my opinion that the Rockefellers did much more to help people by <br>
providing high quality petroleum at low prices than they did with any of <br>
their charity. (Unfortunately, power hungry Nelson Rockefeller did much <br>
to undo the positive aspects of the family business when he became <br>
governor of New York and started taxing, regulating and throwing people <br>
in prison for victimless crimes.) As for Bill Gates, I believe does much <br>
more to help people by running a successful business than he does by <br>
giving away computers to schools, admirable as that may be.<br>
<p>
As for greed, what's wrong with it? What's ugly about it? The idea that <br>
the only people who do any good for others are the altruistic Mother <br>
Theresa types is nonsense. If I provide you with a product or service at <br>
a good price and I do it solely to add to my bank account, what's the <br>
problem? I'd like my (unfortunately low) standard of living to increase <br>
and keep increasing. What's evil about that?<br>
<p>
I don't owe you anything, you don't owe me anything. I cooperate with <br>
others when it is in my self interest to do so. I'm happy to cooperate <br>
with you if there is a good reason to. Otherwise, I'd like to be left <br>
alone. <br>
