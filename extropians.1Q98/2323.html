<i>&gt;Ian Goddard wrote 3/1/98: &lt;The most persuasive argument about the nature of</i><br>

<i>&gt;which the brain is composed, but this "more" is not a supernatural spirit,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's simply the ordering of those atoms.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't know if "ordering" is the best term here, but definitely some</i><br>

<i>&gt;or bits of substance (being), coherency. IOW, why does this particular</i><br>
<i>&gt;quark or bit of substance contribute to the subjective "I" and not the</i><br>
<i>&gt;quark immediately next to it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: I think the answer points to individual consciousness<br>
  being a product not so much of one subatomic particle more<br>
  than others, but of a holistic concert of multiple entities,<br>
  such that the individual self is not in any one of the many<br>
  entities of which it is composed, but is only in them all.<br>
<p>
  Being a radical holist, I see this holistic principle extend-<br>
  ing even beyond the confines of the finite self to encompass <br>
  and contain the entire universe in the definition of "self," <br>
  and I believe that I prove this is a valid definition due to <br>
  the fact that all attributes of your identity and of my iden-<br>
  tity are derived from a holistic relation that contains the <br>
  whole. This is shown and proven within the identity matrix:<br>

<i>&gt;Ian: &lt;It would therefore truly follow in the most intimate way that</i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding what is art is integral to understanding what it is to be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;human and thus what it will take to become a transhuman, since the</i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanical replication of consciousness/art is the cornerstone of the quest</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the transhumanist liberation.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't think that art = consciousness holds up very well because art is</i><br>
<i>&gt;only one category out of many that has consciousness as a prerequisite.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: In other words we could have Consciousness &amp; art,<br>
  or just C and no art, ergo C transcends "art." Well, I <br>
  think yes and no. It's very elusive, just as anything <br>
  to do with C is. I think, yes, C is a "prerequisite"<br>
  of art, but deeper still, art is an expression of C<br>
  so much so that it is a part of C, it is not apart<br>
  from C. Art is also not only the physical medium <br>
  upon which it is built, but is a larger holistic <br>
  function of creating it, seeing and feeling it. <br>
<p>
  I agree that the art = C idea is a little shaky, <br>
  but at the some time I think the parallel I drew <br>
  is highlighting an important definitional harmony<br>
  that signals a need for further and deeper inquiry.<br>
