A theory can be disproved but no theory can be proven because you can always <br>
add a wheel within a wheel to produce an alternate theory that also explains <br>
the facts, it's just that we pick the simplest one for connivance. Obviously <br>
a good theory must make good predictions, but it must do more, it must help <br>
us form mental models that allow more to be learned about the universe. <br>
A good theory might not even be true, Newton's ideas were enormously <br>
productive and served us well for 300 years before running out of gas. <br>
Classical physics last gift to us was its successor, a theory that worked <br>
better.<br>
<p>
It's possible to explain the operation of a Quantum Computer without <br>
resorting to the Many Worlds theory, but doing so is convoluted and difficult, <br>
if you were to program such a machine I believe it would be more productive <br>
to think not of one device but of trillions running in parallel. Of course <br>
nobody has made a Quantum Computer, but I predict that if somebody ever does<br>
then Many Worlds will become the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics <br>
because it will be the easiest way to think  about certain problems.<br>
