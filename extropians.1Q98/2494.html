For those interested in Objectivism, Ayn Rand, and all that, I thought this<br>
might prove entertaining.<br>

From: Joshua Zader &lt;joshua@zader.com&gt;<br>
To: philosophy of objectivism  &lt;OBJECTIVISM-L@cornell.edu&gt;<br>
Subject: Interview with Nathaniel Branden<br>
<p>
Over the next month I will be assembling information for an interview with<br>
Nathaniel Branden for publication on his web site and/or in a forthcoming<br>
edition of his memoir *Judgment Day*.  To that end, I would be interested<br>
in hearing from anyone who:<br>
<p>
(a) Has encountered evidence of factual inaccuracies in *Judgment Day* or<br>
<p>
(b) Has significant questions they would like to hear Nathaniel answer.<br>
(These should not be questions that are answered in *Judgment Day* or his<br>
other books.)<br>
<p>
I would particularly like to hear from any of the "younger, happier"<br>
generation of Objectivists who were not around in the days of NBI but will<br>
assume increasing responsibility for finding new ways to learn, live and<br>
promote Rand's system of ideas.  I do not plan for this interview to be<br>
about what Objectivism was like, but what Objectivism should be like -- and<br>
what will be necessary to take the philosophy and the movement to its "next<br>
level."<br>
<p>
I welcome any thoughts.  (Please feel free to forward this message to other<br>
people of discussion forums.)<br>
