I find myself drawn to enter a discussion thread I am sure has left it's<br>
pertinence to this list behind. The politics of cultural arguments are<br>
IMHO not resolvable. I have visited Cuba twice so on my observations<br>
Cuba is desperatly poor but uniformly poor, as opposed to before the<br>
revolution when there was rich, middle class and poor. The people I<br>
spoke with do not hate Castro per se, but then much of their opinions<br>
are heavily inluenced by official news. The ones I spoke with blame the<br>
US embargo for their economic woes but other than tourists and rock<br>
lobster the US has little they need from Cuba and Cuba trades with the<br>
rest of the world. As to nuclear weapons targeted on Cuba, this was my<br>
trigger to respond, take a breath and think. What would the US target<br>
and how would they explain the fallout to the powerful independant<br>
territory of the Conk (Florida Keys) or Jamaica, Caymans, etc.?<br>
