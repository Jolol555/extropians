<i>&gt; Here is my tentative philosophy of personal identity: anyone who remembers</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Some examples: I am the person typing at this keyboard a second ago, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; he is not me. If I become unconscious and wake up with total amnesia, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; person who wakes up is not me. If he recovers his (my) memory, then he is</i><br>

<i>&gt; me made from scratch by a Power is me, as long as it has sufficiently</i><br>
<i>&gt; authentic memories of being me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; With this definition, there is no conflict between growth and identity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Any transformation, as long as it does not erase my memories, perserves my</i><br>
<i>&gt; identity. To me this philosophy is simply and intuitive, and seems to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; free from inconsistencies and paradoxes. What do you think?</i><br>
<p>
If all the information (including memories) in your brain and body could be<br>
read off into a computer (uploaded), would that computer memory be you?  What<br>
if the original brain and body were destroyed in the uploading?  What if they<br>
were left intact?<br>
<p>
What if the uploaded memories were fed into a fresh body?  What if identical<br>
copies were fed into several fresh bodies?  What if the original brain and<br>
body were not still around?  What if they were?  Would you be the original (if<br>
it existed), the program, or one or more of the copies?<br>
<p>
The program would not change, but the original (if it existed) and the copies<br>
would diverge away from it and from each other.  Which would be you?<br>
