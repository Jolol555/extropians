i'm not so sure.  i do agree with its effects as an aphrodisiac and a<br>
sensory enhancer, but not as as a critical thinking tool due to two<br>
reasons.  Firstly, most of the "great ideas and insights" you get when you<br>
(or at least i) are stoned, are just pretty standard cool ideas otherwise<br>
(that is ideas that you do get while in normal state but don't get past<br>
the higher critical level of "originality" needed for it to be remembered)<br>
Secondly, it puts me to sleep, unless i fight it, so not much enjoyment<br>
conciously registered.  I also am definitely no happier the next day.<br>
