Ever heard of WINE? Or TWIN? (See <a href="http://www.winehq.com/">http://www.winehq.com/</a> or <br>
<a href="http://www.willows.com/">http://www.willows.com/</a> for details.)  BOTH of these are (a) GPL'd,<br>
and (b) run Windows 3.1 binaries fairly well, and Wine also runs<br>
some Win95/WinNT binaries. Work is in progress on turning Wine into<br>
a full-blown Win32 API implementation.<br>
<p>
The problem is that all Microsoft has to do is move the goal-posts once <br>
every three years, by adding a new API to some valuable service. The<br>
commercial developers who Microsoft want to help get help aid in<br>
updating/understanding their APIs, so that new applications rely on<br>
it; the white-room cloners on the Wine team have to run just to keep<br>
up, otherwise not all the bleeding edge applications will run on their<br>
shim, and the luser-base and PHB's will complain "wine is no good, it<br>
can't run xyzzy release 75.4b1".<br>
<p>
I have a PC at home. It runs Linux applications. It also runs java<br>
bytecode, Macintosh applications, DOS applications, SCO Xenix or<br>
UNIX applications, and Windows 3.1 applications (without needing a<br>
reboot :). But will it satisfy someone who wants to run Lotus Notes<br>
Server for NT? Nope.<br>
<p>
One proposal I've seen floated a while ago was to take the Windows<br>
APIs are in effect grab 'em from Microsoft, saying "this is now an<br>
ANSI or ISO standard for a windowing applications programming interface<br>
on intel hardware: live with it". Microsoft would still own their code<br>
base, and would be free to produce a superset of ANSI Windows, but the<br>
availability of a standards document and alternative implementations<br>
would drive a post into the ground and send a message to developers: "if<br>
you use proprietary extensions to the open standard, your code may not<br>
run on other systems". Unfortunately it's either three years too late<br>
or two years too early to do this right now -- M$ are migrating from<br>
a 16-bit API to a 32-bit API, and freezing a standard in the middle would<br>
result in a horrendous mess. But I think by designating the APIs as<br>
an open standard, some of the sting might be taken out of their <br>
ownership by a single monopolistic company. After all, who would have<br>
complained in 1995 about UNIX being owned by Sun or SCO, even though<br>
those companies shipped most of the branded UNIX boxes in circulation?<br>
UNIX was an open standard, administered by The Open Group (or X/Open<br>
as it then was). <br>
<p>
Open standards are bad for monopolies. If Windows was an open standard<br>
rather than Microsoft's +3 magic aluminium baseball bat of compatability,<br>
I'd have a lot less trouble with it.<br>
