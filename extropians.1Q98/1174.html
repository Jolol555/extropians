You mean halogen lightbulbs? I don't know about the situation in the<br>
US, but here in Sweden they are actively pushed by the electricity<br>
companies (yes, our electricity companies try to make us consume less<br>
electricity, and the liquor monopoly does it best to discourage<br>
drinking. Sweden is fantastic :-).<br>
<p>
As for hydroponics, yes, electric light would do with the right kind<br>
of illumination. No need for skyscrapers: Genetic Engineering News had<br>
an article in March 15 1995 about growing plants in an underground<br>
mine, with very positive results. <br>
<p>
With enough energy, most things are possible. Sunlight is nice because<br>
it is so available in most places (i.e. everywhere but Sweden :-) - I<br>
really like the idea of skyscrapers with glass walls facing the south,<br>
filled with greenery. The hydroponics could be grown in trellises<br>
between the outer wall and an inner, thinner glass wall with<br>
apartments on the inside. That way you could get both sunlight,<br>
greenery and climate control.<br>
