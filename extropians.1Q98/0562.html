Or, even neater, you follow Lee Smolin's reasoning: baby universes are a<br>
side-consequence of black holes, the most numerous source of these parents<br>
is a cosmos in which stellar black holes are freshly created during many,<br>
many billions of years, a further incidental side consequence of which is<br>
the creation of carbon in life-affirming quantities :) which is freely<br>
scattered into the surrounding medium even as a new universe is pumped up.<br>
The only problem I have with this, as I've said before, is that I don't<br>
really see why the babies need to closely resemble the parents (although<br>
Mitch once made some comments on this that I couldn't follow).<br>
