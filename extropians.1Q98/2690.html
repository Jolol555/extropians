Actually, I'd just like to add that in the last few months I've come to the<br>
conclusion that the majority of commercial Web sites are cack produced by<br>
people who care more about flash graphics than assisting their customers, and<br>
who don't even realise how much money they're losing in the process.<br>
<p>
For example, I just followed a link to a web-site for a film magazine; only<br>
to reach a page saying 'Sorry, but your browser doesn't meet our requirements,<br>
click here to download Internet Explorer'.<br>
<p>
Now I don't want Internet Explorer, I don't care what *their* requirements<br>
are. They are the ones who are supposed to be selling *me* something, but<br>
they block me out of their site so that they can include some dumb Java<br>
animated graphics. Do they have a clue?<br>
<p>
Another example: a couple of days ago I was searching the Web for a place<br>
to buy a copy of Adobe Premiere; according to the Adobe site, a $750 product.<br>
I went to a site that I've bought from before, to check out their prices. I<br>
clicked on the button, but it didn't work because they've replaced their old<br>
CGI scripts with Javascript, and I have all that cack disabled because of<br>
the security holes.<br>
<p>
They lost a $750 order by trying to force their customers to do what the<br>
company want them to do, rather than catering to all of us.<br>
<p>
Another example: the numerous web sites where people have decided that <br>
HTML text is too low-tech and use images for all their buttons (or worse, <br>
all their content!) with no ALT tags. I don't even have image download <br>
enabled because it's too damn slow on many sites... again, I go elsewhere <br>
to a site that's not so pretty but chooses to help me.<br>
<p>
No wonder Internet commerce is not the cash cow people expected...<br>
