There have been several recent references on the E-list to David Brin's<br>
utopian call for the end of privacy through social engineering a<br>
"Transparent Society."  Such an idea works very well within a common moral<br>
consensual polity, indeed the idea is ancient.  It is at base a renaming of<br>
"Holy Watchfulness" as practiced in monasteries around the world and in<br>
early Puritan villages in colonial America.  It is a monkish ideal.<br>
<p>
There are no visible surface problems with it in this monkish context, the<br>
benefits within the polity are substantial.  However, there are serious,<br>
even intractable problems with it when it is proposed to be extended across<br>
polities that have conflicting ideals and worldviews at their core.  In<br>
particular, you cannot extend "Holy Watchfulness" across the boundary<br>
between extropic and entropic worldviews, i.e., between the culture of life<br>
and the culture of death.<br>
<p>
John Stuart Mills wrote in "On Liberty" (1859): "Society can and does issue<br>
its own mandates:  and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any<br>
mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practices a<br>
social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression,<br>
since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer<br>
means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and<br>
enslaving the soul itself."<br>
<p>
The Transparent Society certainly penetrates deeply into "the details of<br>
life," and can easily be seen as a "social tyranny" worse than "political<br>
oppression."  When democratic society imposes the wrong mandates of the<br>
culture of death (taxpayer-supported murder of unborn children and the sick<br>
and elderly) on those who are opposed to it, how does it escape "enslaving<br>
the soul" by coercively making us party to such brutality?  If your<br>
neighbors want to strengthen the culture of death, then they must be<br>
stopped by political action, action which must begin with secret plotting. <br>
With transparency, you wouldn't be able to meet and plot about political<br>
agendas in any sphere of institutional life, your enemies would see your<br>
opening moves in advance, a recipe for tyranny.  The advantage goes to<br>
those who see the formulation of the first move prior to implementation,<br>
not to those who see the responses.<br>
<p>
As I have written in "Extropy", "irreducible first-person subjectivity,<br>
with its private inner life and moral autonomy, is central to the concept<br>
of an individual."  The fundamental mechanism in nature is to close off the<br>
flow of information outward.  We must reach out on our *own* terms.  The<br>
Transparent Society would have us surrender this private subjectivity to<br>
complete visibility and the potential scientifically-sanctioned<br>
manipulation of our conceptual environment.<br>
<p>
Not only must we have control of what information flows outward, but<br>
growing up and maturing is learning to select which patterns our attention<br>
should be focused on by progressively blocking out more and more of our<br>
environment.  The Transparent Society sends us back to infancy, a cacophony<br>
of environmental input.  As you mature, you want your door locked, you want<br>
isolation, you want time and space to formulate and test unique thoughts,<br>
then control of which thoughts are released into the open.  The Transparent<br>
Society is immature.  It appears as though it could develop into something<br>
akin to the unreflective oral society, all surface and immediacy, the<br>
stagnant 'soaking up existence' of primitivism, not deep and long-term<br>
thought characteristic of the literate, ascending society.  Private thought<br>
itself, i.e., the idea of thinking privately, as opposed to rhetorical<br>
discourse in the public square, developed in monasteries *protected* from<br>
being transparent to the outside world as they preserved literate culture,<br>
and in private libraries after Gutenberg's invention.  It is difficult to<br>
see how private thought, which leads to cultural diversity, is fostered<br>
when we're never alone and never protected from our enemies within the<br>
culture of death.<br>
<p>
The Transparent Society can only foster a monoculture as it spreads across<br>
the world.  Isaiah Berlin, in "The Crooked Timber of Humanity" (1990),<br>
writes of the intractable conflict between one world universalism of<br>
rational tolerance, and the promotion of true individual liberty, true<br>
freedom which can only arise from within a "culture" or moral consensual<br>
polity:<br>
<p>
"If free creation, spontaneous development along one's own native lines,<br>
not inhibited or suppressed by the dogmatic pronouncements of an élite of<br>
self-appointed arbiters, insensitive to history, is to be accorded supreme<br>
value; if authenticity and variety are not to be sacrificed to authority,<br>
organization, centralization, which inexorably tend to uniformity and the<br>
destruction of what men hold dearest - their language, their institutions,<br>
their habits, their form of life, all that has made them what they are -<br>
then the establishment of one world, organized on universally accepted<br>
rational principles - the ideal society - is not acceptable."<br>
<p>
This one world ideal is opposed by the formulation of freedom by Johann<br>
Gottfried Herder: "'the will to live one's own regional, local life, to<br>
develop one's own eigentümlich values, to sing one's own songs, to be<br>
governed by one's own laws in one's own home, not to be assimilated to a<br>
form of life that belongs to all and therefore to no one.'  Freedom, Hegel<br>
once observed, is bey sich selbst seyn - to be at home, not to be impinged<br>
upon by what is not one's own, by alien obstacles to self-realization<br>
whether on the part of individuals or civilizations."<br>
<p>
This formulation of freedom within a consensual moral polity would work<br>
wonderfully in the Transparent Society, but not at all *between* different<br>
polities.  This difficulty is insoluble short of establishing a worldwide<br>
monoculture.  The culture of life is inherently polycentric, the culture of<br>
death is the default monoculture.<br>
<p>
Samuel Huntington in "The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World<br>
Order" (1996) has written: "At the end of the twentieth century the concept<br>
of a universal civilization helps justify Western cultural dominance of<br>
other societies and the need for those societies to ape Western practices<br>
and institutions.  The non-Wests see as Western what the West sees as<br>
universal.  What Westerners herald as benign global integration, such as<br>
the proliferation of worldwide media, non-Westerners denounce as nefarious<br>
Western imperialism.  To the extent that non-Westerners see the world as<br>
one, they see it as a threat.  In 1913  international trade was at record<br>
highs and in the next few years nations slaughtered each other in<br>
unprecedented numbers.  If international commerce at that level could not<br>
prevent war, when can it?  The evidence simply does not support the<br>
liberal, internationalist assumption that commerce promotes peace....  In<br>
Muslim eyes Western secularism, irreligiosity, and hence immorality are<br>
worse evils than the Western Christianity that produced them.  Why<br>
Americans believe that conflict is good within their own society and yet<br>
bad between societies is a fascinating question which, to the best of my<br>
knowledge, no one has seriously studied."<br>
<p>
Non-Western civilizations do not want to be transparent to the West in any<br>
way, shape or form.  Criticism of sacred Islamic or Hindu texts which give<br>
meaning and direction to life is destructive.  Those cultures properly<br>
recognize it as such and resist it strenuously.  Efforts to persuade them<br>
to open themselves to the Transparent Society will result in world<br>
conflict.<br>
<p>
The argument for extending "Holy Watchfulness" across disparate moral<br>
polities is actually no argument at all, but rather a simple displacement<br>
of whatever used to be on the altar, in favor of  "criticism" which will<br>
lead us all to the mystical end of "accountability."<br>
<p>
Why should accountability be the end of this utopian social engineering? <br>
Barbara Tuchman in "The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam" wrote:<br>
"Persistence in error is the problem.  Practitioners of government continue<br>
down the wrong road as if in thrall to some Merlin with magic power to<br>
direct their steps.  Yet to recognize error, to cut losses, to alter<br>
course, is the most repugnant option in government."  Her answer to this<br>
fact of history was not the end of the Transparent Society, accountability,<br>
rather the moral society:  "Aware of the controlling power of ambition,<br>
corruption and emotion, it may be that in the search for wiser government<br>
we should look for the test of character first.  And the test should be<br>
moral courage."  The moral society is, in fact, the only possible answer,<br>
for where does the will to hold accountable come from?<br>
<p>
The moral society must aim at peace, not accountability, if it is to secure<br>
liberty.  Santayana wrote in "Dominations and Powers" (1951): "Liberty<br>
requires peace.  War would impose the most terrible slavery, and you would<br>
never be free if you were always compelled to fight for your freedom.  This<br>
circumstance is ominous:  by it the whole sky of liberty is at once clouded<br>
over.  We are drawn away violently from irresponsible play to a painful<br>
study of facts and to the endless labor of coping with probable enemies."<br>
<p>
So peace is the fundamental ingredient on which liberty thrives, not<br>
accountability.  And how will the Transparent Society protect us from our<br>
very real and menacing external probable enemies, when they can peer into<br>
our private lives with unbelievable levels of detail?  This is a gaping<br>
hole in utopia, that international agreements, global trade and creeping<br>
world governance will do nothing to help.  Accountability never is a<br>
permanent guarantee of minority rights nor is it a protection against<br>
"frog-in-a-pot" style tyranny.  Individual freedom, that is, guaranteed<br>
minority rights and protection from tyranny, depends on the right to secede<br>
from polities gone bad, that have sunk into the culture of death.<br>
<p>
The end of the Transparent Society is bogus and so is the means to that<br>
end, criticism to reduce error.  Criticism erodes the will, lowers risk<br>
taking, leads to conformity.  Criticism to reduce error is a small subset<br>
compared to criticism to change direction, to break down cultural<br>
worldviews.  Certainty of direction in a leader is infectious to the whole<br>
society, it overrides the utility of criticism.  The critical society is<br>
not vital absent certainty of leadership.  Also, the passion of abolition,<br>
which is never absent amongst a large enough population, is criticism for<br>
destruction's sake.  Criticism blunts intimacy and trust.  Self-selected<br>
criticism is all the rage, shallow credentialism begets smugness begets a<br>
high-walled ego.  People who think they can take criticism generally are<br>
ignoring it, the will is sapped if it reaches the heart.  It's not<br>
blunders, but direction that counts.  It's the difference between<br>
efficiency and effectiveness.  Criticism doesn't breed affection, it<br>
destroys friendship.  From an evolutionarily adaptive standpoint, asking<br>
for criticism is simply finding out who your friends are.  Scientific<br>
criticism these days has devolved to swiping dwindling grant money and<br>
fleeting fame from each other.<br>
<p>
There is another fatal flaw in the ability to make a transition to the<br>
Transparent Society.  The flaw involves the idea that the masters of the<br>
world will altruistically roll over and play dead for the benefit of the<br>
masses.<br>
<p>
James Dale Davidson &amp; Lord William Rees-Mogg offer this master-rich<br>
scenario in "The Sovereign Individual" (1997):  "The good news about<br>
individual liberation and autonomy will seem to be bad news to many who are<br>
not among the cognitive elite....  Many of the assurances of equality that<br>
Western people have grown to take for granted in the twentieth century are<br>
destined to die with it....  Markets always place the greatest pressures on<br>
the weakest holders.  Indeed, that is part of their virtue.  They promote<br>
efficiency by removing assets from weak hands....  Increasing amounts of<br>
wealth will find their way into the hands of the ablest entrepreneurs and<br>
venture capitalists worldwide.  Globalization, along with other<br>
characteristics of the information economy, will tend to increase the<br>
income earned by the most talented individuals in each field.  The<br>
Sovereign Individuals of the information economy will not be warlords but<br>
masters of specialized skills, including entrepreneurship and investment. <br>
Yet the feudal hundred-to-one ratio [of peasants to knights] seems set to<br>
return....  Business relations will gravitate toward reliance upon 'circles<br>
of trust.'  Due to encryption, which gives individuals an ability to steal<br>
undetected, honesty will be a more highly valued characteristic of business<br>
associates."<br>
<p>
"Protection will become increasingly technological rather than juridical. <br>
The lower classes will be walled out.  The move to gated communities is all<br>
but inevitable.  Walling out troublemakers is an effective as well as<br>
traditional way of minimizing criminal violence in times of weak central<br>
authority....  New survival strategies for persons of lower intelligence<br>
will evolve, involving greater concentration on development of leisure<br>
skills, sports abilities, and crime, as well as service to the growing<br>
numbers of Sovereign Individuals as income inequality within jurisdictions<br>
rises....  We expect increasing numbers of low-income persons in Western<br>
countries who previously would have depended upon transfer payments from<br>
the state to affiliate with wealthy households as retainers....  In the<br>
next century we shall witness the creation of a world superclass, perhaps<br>
of 500 million very rich people, with 100 million being rich enough to<br>
emerge as Sovereign Individuals [out of 7 billion - 70 to 1 ratio of<br>
servants to masters]."<br>
<p>
Such a scenario, based almost entirely on the acknowledged need for strong<br>
encryption of financial transactions, makes one question the possible<br>
acquiescence of the master-rich to the proposed Transparent Society, which<br>
would allow their servant-poor to observe them in total detail.  Such a<br>
prospect seems ludicrous on the face of it.<br>
<p>
Thomas Aquinas wrote: "For those among them who excel by their intellect<br>
naturally dominate the others; as to those who do not shine by their<br>
intellect, but whose body is robust, they seem to be destined by nature to<br>
servitude."  This is an eternal verity, and cannot be changed by the<br>
Transparent Society or any form of organization whatsoever.  In our<br>
technologically oriented society, the highest intellects able to manipulate<br>
matter to whatever ends they desire will dominate all, no matter what.  It<br>
is foolish, self-delusional and dangerously destructive to presume<br>
otherwise.  The utopian nature of the Transparent Society is clearly on<br>
display here.<br>
<p>
Lastly, the greatest flaw in any lasting achievements the Transparent<br>
Society might produce if it were possible to be successfully installed<br>
worldwide, has to do with human nature, with the destructiveness of<br>
self-love.  The flaw is not a visible surface flaw but a deep flaw, not<br>
easily seen.<br>
<p>
In "The New Criterion" June 1996, an article by Joseph Epstein about La<br>
Rochefoucauld takes the position that only a true gentleman can live in the<br>
Transparent Society.  "This être vrai, or true being or genuine person, is<br>
someone who attains as much lucidity about his own motives and those of<br>
people he deals with as possible - no easy achievement when everything in<br>
society encourages the perpetuation of falsehoods, the exchange of lies,<br>
and the proliferation of illusions.  L'être vrai combines in La<br>
Rochefoucauld with l'honnête homme, the true gentlemen, who lives without<br>
pretension.  Such a man has no need of pretension.  'It is a sign of true<br>
goodness to be willing to live always in the sight of good' - just as 'the<br>
truly honest man is without conceit' and 'lives in public as he does in<br>
private.'"<br>
<p>
But, and this is crucial to the success of the Transparent Society, "Still,<br>
make no mistake, to live with such lucidity and in such harmony is all but<br>
impossible.  What with the maelstrom of self-love and self-interest in<br>
which we live, the added force of the passions that addle our minds, the<br>
banging about that the winds of fortune subject us to... nothing is more<br>
difficult, in La Rochefoucauld's view, than correct judgment."<br>
<p>
This self-love, or amour-propre, which torpedoes correct judgment, is the<br>
Transparent Society's greatest difficulty, even given a common moral<br>
polity.<br>
<p>
"'Amour-propre,' as La Rochefoucauld notes, is like 'the eye that can see<br>
everything but itself.'  In the first of his supplementary maxims, La<br>
Rochefoucauld describes it, in part, thus:  'Amour-propre  is the love of<br>
oneself and of all other things for one's own sake; it makes men idolize<br>
themselves and would cause them to tyrannize over their neighbors had they<br>
the opportunity....  Nothing equals the impetuosity of its desires, the<br>
depths of its schemes, or the ingenuity of its methods....  It is<br>
impossible to fathom the depths or pierce the gloom the abyss in which it<br>
dwells....  There it conceives, breeds, and rears, unknowingly, a vast<br>
number of appetites and dislikes - some of so monstrous a shape that it<br>
fails to recognize them when exposed to the light of day, or cannot bring<br>
itself to own them.  Out of the night that covers it are born the absurd<br>
ideas it entertains of itself; thence come its errors, its ignorance, its<br>
clumsiness, and its fatuous beliefs about itself - its notion that its<br>
feelings are dead when they are but asleep, that it has lost its activity<br>
when once it is at rest, and that it has got rid of the appetites it has<br>
for the moment appeased.'  To be human is to have amour-propre; to have<br>
amour-propre is to be imprisoned by it; yet to understand that one is in<br>
fact imprisoned does not ever quite set one free."<br>
<p>
Even in the Transparent Society, as on the E-list, we will fail to see our<br>
monstrous appetites and desires, or fail to own them.  Our Puritan villages<br>
and monasteries with their "Holy Watchfulness" will break up and give way<br>
to privacy once again.  It is human nature that individuals do not bear<br>
scrutiny.  The Transparent Society, like all utopias, is an immature revolt<br>
against nature.<br>
