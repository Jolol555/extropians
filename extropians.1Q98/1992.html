If you're immortal (preferably in some kind of uploaded form) and able<br>
to create/do about anything you wish, then what's the rush? The only<br>
reason why progress is so important *right now* is because we're still<br>
such limited, *mortal* creatures. Gods, on the other hand, can afford <br>
to chill out. If there are no significant changes to your identity for a<br>
long time, that is no problem as long as you're enjoying yourself and<br>
your safety is not infringed.<br>
<p>
P.s: I assume that biological "immortality" (no aging) and uploading<br>
(in whatever form) will arrive at about the same time, so that there<br>
will never be a real era of immortal "plain humans". Everyone who's<br>
anyone will probably upload a.s.a.p, once the technology is refined.<br>
