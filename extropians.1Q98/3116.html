<p>
Government spending, as you'll find in any macroeconomics textbook, raises<br>
the interest rate, which results in decreased private investment.  As<br>
investment decreases, long term growth decreases.  <br>
<p>
As a result of this decreased long term growth, the welfare of the poor<br>
might look something like this:<br>
<p>
(Only the shape of this graph is relevant; I cede that these numbers can't<br>
be proven as it is impossible for a given state to try two policies<br>
simultaneously and compare.)<br>

inflation)	|/<br>
		-----------------------------<br>
<p>
			Time<br>
<p>
Note that while under the welfare system, the poorest citizens are at first<br>
richer than they were under the non-welfare system (denoted by $ on the<br>
graph), after a given period of time, these two lines intersect.  (The<br>
point marked w/ a * on the graph.)  From this point forward, welfare isn't<br>
even better for the poor.  Meanwhile, of course, everyone else has been<br>
suffering from decreased growth and decreased disposable income. <br>
<p>
Also note that if welfare were to be abandoned, the poor would immediately<br>
lose the quantity $ from their inflation-adjusted income; while this would<br>
eventually be more than offset by increased growth, when the poor take a<br>
hit it's rare they will simply be able to dissave a bit or decrease<br>
consumption of luxuries.  This money will likely come out of the<br>
food/health budget; it would also lead to a rise in homelessness as the<br>
poor find themselves unable to pay rent/mortgages, and a possible short run<br>
decrease in growth as some poor will find themselves (suddenly) unable to<br>
work at all.  Again, while this loss would EVENTUALLY be offset, the short<br>
term losses could be tremendous.<br>
<p>
Welfare is good for the poor in the short run, it is bad for everyone in<br>
the long run.  Abandoning welfare is quite bad for the poor in the short<br>
run, but good for everyone in the long run.<br>
