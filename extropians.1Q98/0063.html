Hi!<br>

"How and Why We Age" by Leonard Hayflick, page 21 of the first edition.<br>
He claims that animals such as some fish, amphibians, and reptiles (like<br>
the Galapagos tortoise) appear not to age -- they don't age at all or<br>
age so slowly that we are not capable of determining it.<br>
<p>
Erik wrote on the same subject (and my reply also applies to what Tony<br>
B. Csoka wrote):<br>
<i>&gt; Maybe it would be helpful to create a detailed table/overview of species</i><br>
<i>&gt; which do not age, including their habitat. Parallels?</i><br>
<p>
It's a good idea, but I would focus on their evolutionary path rather on<br>
their habitats. For example, do you know that mammals can't produce<br>
ascorbic acid (a powerful anti-oxidant)? Little mistakes like that might<br>
be behind aging! And did you know that the Galapagos Tortoise's cells<br>
have more anti-oxidants than our cells (also taken from Hayflick's<br>
book)? There are many other interesting phenomenons, I'm actually trying<br>
to make a list of them (will be probably ready in a couple of months).<br>
<p>
The only site I know in the Internet that mentions non-aging species<br>
with some detail is my own. The URL is:<br>
