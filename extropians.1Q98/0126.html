Maybe della Mirandola's "Oration on the dignity of Man" should be included<br>
in the reading list. It was written in 1486, and was startlingly extropian<br>
in tone. Needless to say, it got him in a lot of trouble. Here is an<br>
excerpt from God's speech to Adam:<br>
 <br>
``We have given you, O Adam, no visage proper to yourself, nor endowment<br>
properly your own, in order that whatever place, whatever form,<br>
whatever gifts you may, with premeditation, select, these same you may<br>
have and possess through your own judgement and decision. The nature of<br>
all other creatures is defined and restricted within laws which We have<br>
laid down; you, by contrast, impeded by no such restrictions, may, by your<br>
own free will, to whose custody We have assigned you, trace for yourself<br>
the lineaments of your own nature. I have placed you at the very center of<br>
the world, so that from that vantage point you may with greater ease<br>
glance round about you on all that the world contains. We have made you a<br>
creature neither of heaven nor of earth, neither mortal nor immortal, in<br>
order that you may, as the free and proud shaper of your own being,<br>
fashion yourself in the form you may prefer. It will be in your power to<br>
descend to the lower, brutish forms of life; you will be able, through<br>
your own decision, to rise again to the superior orders whose life is<br>
divine.'' <br>
