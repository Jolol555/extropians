My news for this month:<br>
<p>
Presenter with Erin Reid, Gender Track<br>
The 5th International Conference on Bisexuality, at Harvard <br>
University, Boston, MA, April 3-5, 1998<br>
	We think that this may be the first presentation related to <br>
transhumanist thought at Harvard (unless someone knows otherwise).<br>
