Yes, there are bad preservatives, nitrites for example.  But many are potent<br>
antioxidants, some may be good for you.  The BHA/BHT question is definitly a<br>
subject for more research.  But the primary value of their use is to minimize<br>
the oxidation of the oils.  Rancid oils are life shortening.   Rather than the<br>
preservatives, I worry more about the pesticide residues, and their possible<br>
hormone activities.  It is better to grow or buy direct from farmers (fresh).<br>
It tastes better!  <br>
When we eat diverse plants, some containing carcinogens (or some other toxin)<br>
, we also consume anticarcinogens (Carotenoids, vit C and E, the brocolli<br>
stuff...)<br>
Our systems and defenses have evolved to work best with a mix of plant<br>
chemicals.  Longevity may select, evolving as grandparents increased the<br>
survival probability  in more complex societies.<br>
Does this thread belong on the Extropy list?  Yes I think so.  The topic may<br>
be of interest to the lifextensionist color of Extropianism.  Lifextension and<br>
damage minimization (increased qualilty of life) is a fine Extropian idea<br>
until powerful  nanomolecular methods are available, alone or in conjunction<br>
with cryonics.<br>
