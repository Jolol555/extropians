This is the great delima. Where do you stop and say, "most people don't<br>
understand the logistics of this, so lets dumb it down, simplify it??" I<br>
think that the X-Files does this A LOT. There are actually only a few<br>
episodes where I think they demonstrate complex plot devices. In fact, the<br>
only real episodes seem to pivot on goverment conspiracy plot devices. I've<br>
always thought that the non-related episodes were somewhat weak.<br>
<p>
I'm not disappointed with this episode when you contrast it to previous<br>
episodes from the "non consipiracy" category. Do you remember the first<br>
murderous AI episode?? PURE STINKY TRASH.<br>
<p>
But that's just my opinion..<br>

<i>&gt; Actually, I was disappointed with the episode.  Of course, I loved</i><br>
<i>&gt; seeing an episode written by Cyberpunk authors.  I enjoyed seeing</i><br>
<i>&gt; similarities with their previous work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; INVISIGOTH was rude to Scully, saying that she was too dumb to</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand the network.  Unfortuneately, she didn't really get to</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrate any great skill in the episode.  She didn't do anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; special or figure anything out to solve the case.  She just stated that</i><br>
<i>&gt; she was a superior intelligence without demonstrating it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The hacker friends of Mulder quoted ancient history in Computer Lore and</i><br>
<i>&gt; then seemed to approve of INVISIGOTH because she was "hot".  They didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; analyze how great her work was, except in the vaguest of terms as being</i><br>
<i>&gt; "very advanced".  I wish they would have demonstrated more to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; audience.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; At one point they needed "someone in the Government" to track down the</i><br>
<i>&gt; T3 connection.  Shouldn't the network/hackers/cyberpunks have been able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to do that?  This probably was a plot device to allow Mulder to track</i><br>
<i>&gt; down the chicken-farm trailer and get there first, but if a non-network</i><br>
<i>&gt; government man can trace a network connection to its source faster than</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cyberpunk/chic who wants to upload and live in the net, then it</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't show a superior knowledge of the network.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I also wish the street-smart attitude was explained as resulting from</i><br>
<i>&gt; hiding from the government and/or avoiding industrial espionage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Without a proper background explanation, INIVISIGOTH appeared to be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; homeless corporate drop-out living in a box and surfing the net all</i><br>
<i>&gt; day.  She also didn't appear very street smart to me, just tough and</i><br>
<i>&gt; rude.  She played her music so loud that Mulder and Scully could zoom in</i><br>
<i>&gt; right to her box, etc.  She had no defenses and could be completely</i><br>
<i>&gt; taken over by Mulder and Scully with a handgun.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I also wish there was more technology being used by the cyberpunks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Except for their connections to the Internet and their taking-over of</i><br>
<i>&gt; other people's computers and satellites, they didn't seem to have much</i><br>
<i>&gt; of their own personal stuff.  I wish they would have faught back more</i><br>
<i>&gt; via the computer and network, and relied less on guns, handcuffs, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; FBI agents to respond.  When the satellite was zooming in, I wish they</i><br>
<i>&gt; would have faught back on the computer more.  I wish there were more</i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons than the telephone calls in the beginning and the satellite.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; wish the network entity could track them by credit card purchases,</i><br>
<i>&gt; cameras in stores, records in the FBI, or anything more than just</i><br>
<i>&gt; tapping their phone line.  As long as they stayed off the phone, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; network entity was helpless, which is unrealistic given how much of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; lives are recorded by computers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I know I'm being picky.  I loved the episode for personal reasons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, as a tool to educate the public, I don't expect nonExtropians</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have learned much if anything from this episode.  It didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrate or prove any points.  It just alluded to most things that</i><br>
<i>&gt; only insiders applauded with all their ramifications.  Outsiders just</i><br>
<i>&gt; watched with little interest.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course as Dennis Miller says, That's just my opinion...  I could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong...  (Maybe I'm just greedy and want more, more, more!)</i><br>
