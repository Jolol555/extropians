<p>
It's interesting what you read in my post. The word "government" doesn't even<br>
appear there. <br>
<p>
I am NOT appalled by what governements do, because governments in most states<br>
are just a tool<br>
of big enterprises and investment banks which helps them to extract money from<br>
the population. I am not<br>
appalled by what a gun does but by what its owner does with it.<br>
<p>
Who sells the weapons? The government? Who earns money when a war has started?<br>
The government? Who profits<br>
from a tax policy which burdens the majority and favours the minority? The<br>
minority, of course. Which is <br>
not the government.<br>
<p>
In Germany, a politician from the Social Democratic Party recently suggested<br>
to raise a minimum tax for<br>
millionaires. Of course this half-hearted proposal will never be realized. But<br>
it showed that millionaires and<br>
the big industry which bores them do not have to pay a single D-Mark if their<br>
tax advisors are good enough. <br>
Even the thousands of students who protest against the low funds flowing into<br>
education now use the <br>
slogan "Tax millionaires". Futile, of course.<br>
<p>
John Clark, one of the more intelligent free market advisors, would answer:<br>
"If you remove governments, all this <br>
corruption will disappear and the free market will bring up only efficient<br>
companies." The problem is that by<br>
removing government, you only remove a cover under which the true power elite<br>
hides. The power structures remain -<br>
and before you can say "Jebediah", your country will be ruled directly by big<br>
enterprises. The reason why governments<br>
are needed today is that they make major repressions unnecessary. The larger<br>
the privatization and direct influence of big<br>
enterprises is, the more repression is needed to justify it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         Your nightmare scenario of funcloning is close to what I would envision if</i><br>
<i>&gt; elitists (governments) are left in control of technologies such as cloning</i><br>
<i>&gt; (FDA). Except in the case of the elitists I see the technology being used</i><br>
<i>&gt; to create and control soldiers who are never exposed to any social</i><br>
<i>&gt; interaction beyond their highly trained tightly knit units. I wonder if,</i><br>
<i>&gt; without any interaction with average individuals, these clones would have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; normal resistance to initiating violence. Sadly, the past points to many</i><br>
<i>&gt; examples of people who were raised in semi civil societies turning out</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely violent due to destructive memes ( fascism, socialism, statism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; luddism). Just imagine what the Marine of the future could be like!</i><br>
<p>
Luddism is a perfectly understandable reaction in capitalism. Because in a<br>
capitalist society, progress in production efficiency<br>
will often hurt the population. The more efficient you are, the less workers<br>
you need. More unemployment. 4,5 million registered <br>
in Germany today, and rising. America circumvents this by having the whole<br>
family at work day &amp; night and counting the jobs, not <br>
the people. I do not justify luddism and I am not a Luddite, but as I said,<br>
it's understandable.<br>
<p>
About military: Why do you think we have it? Because some bums in the<br>
government think we need it to defend our country? <br>
<p>
Most extropians despise governments, but at the same time, they are the<br>
perfect democrats. Because they really believe that<br>
democracy works the way it is intended to work - they just think that this way<br>
is not right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         Due to the above argument, I propose that the future will be much safer</i><br>
<i>&gt; with cloning available on the free market rather than controlled by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; elite. It is kinda like computers; the more widespread and available they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are, the less likely it is that they will be used to oppress us.</i><br>
<p>
Ever heard about the NSA? That's not a product of the free market, but it's a<br>
structure needed in all governments (and the<br>
free market is just a new form of dictatorship).  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         You seem to speak out of both sides of your mouth when you rail against a</i><br>
<i>&gt; prison state and attack the freemarket in the same letter. If not a</i><br>
<i>&gt; freemarket what? A prison market?</i><br>
<p>
The prison state is a prison market. I was talking about privatized prisons. <br>
<p>
The perfect solution would be a truly anarcho-socialist society, but we won't<br>
get it. So we have to take care that what governments<br>
and especially the people behind them do doesn't hurt us.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "It's a far easier thing to have a firm anchor in ignorance than to set out</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the troubled seas of thought."</i><br>
<p>
And many extropians seem to prefer the easy way. <br>
