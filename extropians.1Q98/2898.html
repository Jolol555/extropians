Richard Thieme's piece was forwarded to the E-list 3/16/98: &lt;We are<br>
beginning to engineer our very selves, to see our subjective ways of<br>
framing reality and being in the world as modular objects to be<br>
manufactured and enhanced.&gt;<br>
<p>
Up to now, this has been called formation of character, expanding our<br>
faculties.  Nothing new.  As long as it's our own selves we are<br>
engineering, freedom is necessary.  When it comes to engineering other<br>
selves, a willingness to submit to political restraint is necessary.<br>
<p>
&lt;In the next century, it's going to be bootstrapping big time for the human<br>
species as we see ourselves as an image in our own collective mind, an<br>
image to be designed and executed.&gt;<br>
<p>
And the image makers, the creators of culture, will provide the ideals and<br>
standards of our new faculties and physiognomies.  They will lead, the rest<br>
will follow in a hazy made-to-order liberty.<br>
<p>
&lt;Ethical reflection never anticipates the breakthroughs that make us sit up<br>
straight, nor do legal niceties.&gt;<br>
<p>
Nonsense.  If ethical reflection was useless, no one would do it.  It isn't<br>
useless, it is vital to all formation of culture.<br>
