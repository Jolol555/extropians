<i>&gt; From: Paul Hughes &lt;organix@hotmail.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You may have much better luck if you add "gay" to the description.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are very few extropian women out there, and chances to recruit</i><br>
<i>&gt; more anytime soon do not seem great. I think we need to clone some </i><br>
<i>&gt; female</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropians.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; - Sasha, who avoids dating the mundanes, and stays single.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My Response:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I love when I get the oppurtunity to play devil's advocate, </i><br>
Me too!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and such an oppurtunity this is.</i><br>
Indeed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Has anyone ever wondered *why* there are so few extropian females?  What </i><br>
<i>&gt; does this say about extropians?    </i><br>
Or: what does this say about everyone else?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What is it, either about our </i><br>
<i>&gt; philosophy (basically sound) and our communication (needs work), that is </i><br>
<i>&gt; a turn off to so many women who would otherwise be sympathetic?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can think of at least 4 women who I personally know who want to live </i><br>
<i>&gt; forever, increase their potential and explore the greater cosmos as much </i><br>
<i>&gt; as all of us.  So why do they feel so uncomfortable when I have given </i><br>
<i>&gt; them extropian writings?</i><br>
&lt;barnyard speculation mode engaged&gt;<br>
Because:<br>
--women are generally more modest &amp; less assertive/self-secure (arrogant) <br>
than men. This is almost certainly a genetic (ooops!) trait later reinforced by <br>
society. Extropianism is partially about "taking control of your life", "breaking <br>
away from the herd", "being independent, assertive and self-confident", and <br>
these things go directly against the female nature/reinforced role-model of meek,<br>
altruistic nurturer. People in general don't like to go against the flow, and <br>
of those who *do*, most are men. The more agressive and egocentric nature<br>
of men (generally speaking, of course) makes it easier for them to reach the<br>
sky and touch the stars, so to speak. If women join a "radical" group, it is<br>
usually out of loyalty to (or fear of rejection by) a boyfriend/husband/father etc. <br>
who has joined first. Only few join out of personal initiative.<br>
--also, it must be noted that women usually consider clubs/associations/<br>
organizations as childish boy's business.<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think these are the main reasons why we see<br>
so few women in transhumanism/extropianism/cryonics etc.<br>
<p>
By the way, it's not just the women that are underrepresented in transhumanism.<br>
*Everybody* is, except relatively young, white, higher educated middle class males. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt; --&gt; A true extropian philosphy is one that should appeal to both sexes </i><br>
<i>&gt; equally- a transexual philosophy..  Since it isn't, perhaps we need to </i><br>
<i>&gt; re-asses how it can.  IMHO, a future without a womens touch is no future </i><br>
<i>&gt; at all.</i><br>
As technology advances, and becomes a part of everyday life, the (present) <br>
extropian ideas will slowly loose their SF image and become mainstream.<br>
Then the women, and the rest, might finally join in greater numbers. Then<br>
again, the extropians of the future will probably be 20-200 years ahead of <br>
*their* time (unless a singularity makes this impossible), so extropianism<br>
might by definition never be able to become mainstream. As long as there<br>
is diversity, there will always be entities with some more foresight than others:<br>
the extropians.<br>
