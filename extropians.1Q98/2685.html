<p>
<p>
I don't think it's logical because fairness is a useless concept in this  <br>
context.  A man becomes evil because of his genes or his environment or <br>
perhaps some random fluctuation in his brain, this in no way excuses his <br>
actions because it doesn't matter why he's a monster, he's still a monster <br>
and must be dealt with to ensure he doesn't commit more evil. However, the <br>
"balancing the books" meme that sees virtue in the suffering of other people <br>
is pointless,  a relic of Christian mythology about hell, " God is good and <br>
if it's OK for him to burn people for eternity then it must be OK to torture <br>
somebody I don't like for a few days before I kill him, God seems to enjoy it <br>
and I do too". Such ideas belong on the ash heap of history.<br>
<p>
That's the logical reason, but I have another reason and it's is purely  <br>
emotional and therefore much more powerful. I simply become unhappy when I <br>
see another living thing in pain, and if I'm the cause of that pain then I'm <br>
even more unhappy. I don't claim there is any profound significance in my <br>
attitude, it's just the way my brain is wired.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;By the way, what would the rationale be against corporal punishment         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;for violent but non-lethal crimes?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I see insurmountable practical problems because I don't see how you could get  <br>
the calibration right. Even if they commit the exact same crime, a 25 year <br>
old 300 pound Olympic weight lifter and a 82 year old 89 pound grandmother <br>
can not receive the same corporal punishment. You'd end up killing some <br>
people for minor crimes and giving virtually no punishment to others who <br>
commit major ones.  <br>
