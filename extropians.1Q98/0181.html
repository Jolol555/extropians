<p>
This may be, tho' for me it is not so much that I am apprehensive about<br>
movements or ideology, as that I think these words have meanings and I'm<br>
simply not sure extropianism as I see it functioning in the world behaves<br>
particularly *like* a movement.  If it wants to be a "movement", I'm<br>
curious to see just what its agenda finally amounts to.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I am not sure if it makes much sense to think of extropianism as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;movement, given the forms it seems to exhibit most characteristically over</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the five years or so I've been looking it over.  More like a constellation</i><br>

<p>
I don't know what you mean when you say I am too close to it.  Certainly I<br>
agree with you that this is a discussion about seeing the forest as well<br>
as the trees.  I don't see how I'm diagnosing "bad parts" of the<br>
"movement," and I can't see how to recommend "repairs" when my question is<br>
about what extropianism is functioning *as* in the first place.  As a<br>
clearinghouse for ideas about technological development and life-extension<br>
practices, extropian fora seem to function admirably well. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [snip]  What we need are people not to speak</i><br>
<i>&gt; out for a particular idea, but for "technology as good" for technotran-</i><br>
<i>&gt; scendence, and growth.  Having an actor or actress do this would make</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ideas reach even more people.</i><br>
<p>
"Technology is good" is as good a transhuman slogan as WIRED's recent<br>
"change is good" -- that is to say, it is no good at all.  Good technology<br>
is good.  Foresight in the face of exponential technological development<br>
is good.  Extropians seem to have a more robust sense than even most<br>
conventional technophiles of just how sweeping technological<br>
transformation may soon get (even if you are wary about the likelihood of<br>
a singularity), and this puts us in a position to make a real difference<br>
in preparing the world for these changes and ameliorating the worst of the<br>
damage they might cause while embracing their benefits.  *This* insight is<br>
worth building a movement around, imho.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A format that might come to mind is...  A child is dying of some hormone</i><br>
<i>&gt; deficiency.  Clone sheep are producing the hormone through the wonders</i><br>
<i>&gt; of genetic engineering.  Show this stuff in action.  Show the child living</i><br>
<i>&gt; another day.  Have the well known person read the copy and cry and</i><br>
<i>&gt; cheer at the appropiate moments.</i><br>
<p>
This would likely be of benefit (although I have some issues about the<br>
unquestioning instrumentalization of nonhuman animal species in scenarios<br>
like this), but I fail in any case to see how it is more than incidentally<br>
"extropian," if "extropian" denotes a movement with a discernible agenda<br>
beyond broadly humanistic optimism with a background in sf.  How would<br>
propaganda favorable to cloning connect up with right to die legislation,<br>
competing security agencies, jupiter brains, and the like?  Cloning<br>
doesn't need extropianism, except insofar as cloning is a stepping stone<br>
toward something like a singularity.  This is why I agree with you that<br>
this is a discussion about the forest *and* the trees where extropianism<br>
as a movement properly so-called is concerned.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This might get a lot of the fence sitters on your side and the masses, who</i><br>
<i>&gt; then can be used to bully politicians into not outlawing cloning.  It seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; worth a try.</i><br>
<p>
I can't for the life of me figure out what fence-sitting amounts to in<br>
regard to what extropians want *as extropians*.  Who are the<br>
fence-sitters?  Those who think the future won't happen? Those who don't<br>
realize the changes are going to be big ones?  Or the ones who aren't<br>
actively in the labs and boardrooms doing the research and drumming up the<br>
capital to incubate these changes?  By all means, it's worth trying to<br>
keep cloning legal in the face of unreasoning fear.  That would be a good<br>
thing.  But is that enough on the face of it to make it an *extropian*<br>
thing?<br>
