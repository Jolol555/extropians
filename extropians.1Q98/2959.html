<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't see how that would work.  Just adding more junk DNA will not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; reduce the number of mutations in the coding DNA.  The mutation rate</i><br>
is<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; presumably constant per base.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This may be a bad presumption.  I have seen many assume that mutation</i><br>
rate<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is constant per base, but I have never seen a validation of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;assumption.  If mutagens are in any way significant in causing mutation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mutation rate will not be constant per base, as the amount of most</i><br>
mutation<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is not directly related to the number of base pairs. (eg. UV radiation) </i><br>
I<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;would assume that for these mutagens, number of mutations has a greater</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;relation to the amount of mutagen than the number of base pairs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Twice as many base pairs means twice as many UV hits at a given flux. </i><br>
There's<br>
<i>&gt; just not enough DNA, even in animals, to screen an appreciable amount of</i><br>
UV.<br>
<p>
I would think lower wavelength EM radiation would be screened by the<br>
massive clumps of DNA that exist in a eukaryotic cell, especially<br>
non-coding sequences which(interestingly enough) tend to clump up to a very<br>
high degree in a bundle of nucleotides and histones.  Maybe the low<br>
wavelength I'm talking about it not very common (cosmic/gamma rays, maybe?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The idea you have would have two main requirements:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) The exposure of the cell to the mutagen cannot depend on the amount of</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; DNA in the cell.  Direct radiation is out, although free radicals from </i><br>
<i>&gt; radiation would be OK.</i><br>
<p>
Along with free radicals from metabolic processes, free radicals from the<br>
environment, and other chemical mutagens.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 2) The mutagen must be largely eliminated by mutating DNA. If the mutagen</i><br>
<i>&gt; is largely cleared by any other process, increasing DNA will just</i><br>
increase<br>
<i>&gt; the proportion "cleared" by affecting DNA.  Also, if the mutagen is </i><br>
<i>&gt; not destroyed or inactivated by mutating DNA, then obviously extra DNA</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't help.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only mutagen I know of that would meet qualification 2 is other DNA.</i><br>
<p>
Try most carcinogens.  Most carcinogens work by binding to areas of DNA<br>
during cell division.  The replication process has to skip this part of the<br>
DNA, causing a massive deletion.  Obviously, if such a mutagen is bound, it<br>
will only mutate that particularly area, and no others.  Thus, it is<br>
"cleared" in this sense.<br>
<p>
hmmm... I think I may have something there, what do you think?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The idea that "junk" DNA provides a distraction for all those transposons</i><br>
<i>&gt; hopping around has been suggested, although I don't know where.</i><br>
<p>
Also a good explanation.  A good way to test this hypothesis would be to<br>
look for transposon binding/recombination sequences in junk DNA.<br>
