<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Fighting over Ayn Rand:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  A radical individualist's followers can't get along</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  BY MARCI McDONALD</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The drama has all the requisite ingredients of a typical Ayn Rand plot</i><br>
<i>&gt;  line: epic aspirations, forbidden passions, and intractable rivalries that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  pit fervent purists against pragmatists who call for measured compromise.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  But 16 years after Rand's death, that scenario springs not from some just</i><br>
<i>&gt;  discovered scrap of her fiction but from her own complex and paradoxical</i><br>
<i>&gt;  legacy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  On the one hand, many of the once radical notions Rand spelled out in her</i><br>
<i>&gt;  novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, not to mention in her</i><br>
<i>&gt;  philosophy of rational self-interest, appear to have achieved mainstream</i><br>
<i>&gt;  status. Rand's half-century-old calls for minimal government, unfettered</i><br>
<i>&gt;  individualism, and the "morality of selfishness" have now become</i><br>
<i>&gt;  commonplace. The most esteemed and powerful former member of her inner</i><br>
<i>&gt;  circle, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, holds unparalleled sway</i><br>
<i>&gt;  over global markets. Rand's books still sell a brisk 300,000 copies a year,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and in January, 55 years after its publication, The Fountainhead was named</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the favorite novel of the freshman class at that onetime bastion of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  countercultural protest, the University of California--Berkeley. Earlier in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the decade, when a survey by Reader's Digest and the Library of Congress</i><br>
<i>&gt;  asked respondents to rate which books had most influenced them, Atlas</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Shrugged came in second, right after the Bible. Now, nearly half a century</i><br>
<i>&gt;  after its last major Rand film--King Vidor's 1949 version of The</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Fountainhead with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal--Hollywood is jumping on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the Rand bandwagon: At least two movie projects are in the works, and a new</i><br>
<i>&gt;  feature-length documentary, Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life, has just been</i><br>
<i>&gt;  nominated for an Academy Award.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  But ironically, at a time when Rand's influence has never seemed so</i><br>
<i>&gt;  pervasive, her followers have never been so fractious. In a development</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Rand herself might have relished, two rival institutes are locked in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  bitter philosophical--and public-relations--battle over which more</i><br>
<i>&gt;  faithfully conveys her message. The story of that rivalry provides a vivid</i><br>
<i>&gt;  object lesson in the inherent pitfalls of maintaining any large-scale</i><br>
<i>&gt;  movement committed to the primacy of individualism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;          A sanctioned affair. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The internecine feud owes its roots, in part, to Rand's own passions. For</i><br>
<i>&gt;  more than a decade, she conducted a love affair with her closest</i><br>
<i>&gt;  collaborator, Nathaniel Branden, a disciple 25 years her junior. At 50,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Rand had wrested a benediction for that liaison with the 25-year-old</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Branden, whom she had met as a University of California--Los Angeles</i><br>
<i>&gt;  student, from their respective spouses--an achievement that might seem</i><br>
<i>&gt;  remarkable except that it echoes her own story lines. During the years of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  their affair, Branden codified the principles of her novels into a strict</i><br>
<i>&gt;  philosophical system that she dubbed objectivism, complete with an</i><br>
<i>&gt;  institute in his name and a newsletter with 20,000 subscribers. But in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  1968, when he backed out of Rand's bed for another woman, an objectivist</i><br>
<i>&gt;  disciple herself, Rand excommunicated him with a brutal denunciation that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  left her movement splintered--her most dedicated acolytes on one side, most</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of the rest drifting into the mushrooming libertarian movement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  For years, their doctrinal squabbles had been confined to diatribes in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  obscure publications and, more recently, on the Internet's proliferating</i><br>
<i>&gt;  objectivist Web sites. But last October, that rivalry surfaced publicly</i><br>
<i>&gt;  when more than 400 Randians gathered in Washington, D.C., to mark the 40th</i><br>
<i>&gt;  anniversary of Atlas Shrugged at an event organized under the wing of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Cato Institute, the capital's libertarian think tank. Greeted by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  spectacle of a real-life bodybuilder hoisting the globe above a spotlighted</i><br>
<i>&gt;  pair of pecs, the speakers included ABC-TV personality John Stossel, Wall</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Street Journal editorial writer John Fund, and Nathaniel Branden himself,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  now a Beverly Hills psychotherapist frequently hailed as the father of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  self-esteem movement. But nowhere in evidence was a single representative</i><br>
<i>&gt;  from the California-based Ayn Rand Institute, the official guardian of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Rand's reputation, which had broken with the gala's organizers years</i><br>
<i>&gt;  earlier.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Meanwhile, the institute had given its blessing to the Oscar-nominated</i><br>
<i>&gt;  documentary, Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life, which opened in New York and Los</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Angeles February 13 and moves to 15 other cities over the next two months.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  In that sanctioned portrait, Branden merits only the briefest mention, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the film contains scant reference to their affair, which was finally</i><br>
<i>&gt;  revealed by his ex-wife, Barbara, after Rand's death. In fact, as one</i><br>
<i>&gt;  condition of access to the institute's archives, the documentary's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  producer, Michael Paxton, agreed to not even interview the Brandens. "It's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ridiculous nonsense," says Barbara Branden. "They're fanatical true</i><br>
<i>&gt;  believers, and they've rewritten history totally." For her, there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;  doubt that the man responsible for banishing them from the official record</i><br>
<i>&gt;  is her cousin Leonard Peikoff--whom Branden introduced as a gangly</i><br>
<i>&gt;  17-year-old pre-med student to Rand's inner circle nearly four decades ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  But Peikoff, who endured to become Rand's legal heir, is unapologetic about</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ordering their exclusion. "I haven't the slightest interest in supporting</i><br>
<i>&gt;  those who disseminate falsehoods about Ayn Rand," he says, "any more than I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  would ask Hitler to appear in a documentary about George Washington."</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Barbara Branden, however, is getting another crack at setting the record</i><br>
<i>&gt;  straight in a forthcoming cable TV movie based upon her confessional 1986</i><br>
<i>&gt;  bestseller, The Passion of Ayn Rand. Currently set to air on Showtime this</i><br>
<i>&gt;  fall, the film of the same name depicts the unlikely romance between the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mature Rand, played by Helen Mirren--whose blond Prime Suspect bob has been</i><br>
<i>&gt;  slicked for the occasion into Rand's trademark brunet blunt cut--and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Branden, played by the boyish Eric Stoltz. Now 68 and a consultant to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  film, Barbara Branden watched the recent shooting in Toronto and wept over</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Mirren's uncanny portrayal of the guru Branden claims she still adores.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "I'm trying to present Ayn Rand as a human being," she says, "not as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  goddess who had to be infallible." Still, she does not hesitate to brand</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the movement she helped create a cult. "The signs were all there," she</i><br>
<i>&gt;  says. "People were afraid to ask searching questions because they didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;  want their heads taken off. They were becoming little Ayn Rand parrots."</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The fierce infighting among Rand's legatees calls to mind the split between</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Trotskyites and Stalinists that haunted New York's literary left in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  1930s. It is an analogy that would have infuriated the Russian-born Rand,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  who spent her life crusading against communism. Landing in New York from</i><br>
<i>&gt;  St. Petersburg in 1926 at the age of 21, with $50 in her pocket and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  speaking broken English, Alice Rosenbaum re-created herself with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  determination worthy of her own fictional heroines. Borrowing a Finnish</i><br>
<i>&gt;  writer's first name that aptly rhymed with "mine" and a surname from her</i><br>
<i>&gt;  cherished typewriter, she set out for Hollywood, where she spent nearly two</i><br>
<i>&gt;  decades working her way from bit-part actress to screenwriter before</i><br>
<i>&gt;  earning enough to turn full time to novel writing. When she finally</i><br>
<i>&gt;  published The Fountainhead in 1943, most major reviewers ignored or savaged</i><br>
<i>&gt;  it, missing her celebration of individualism entirely. To those who became</i><br>
<i>&gt;  devotees, that reception seemed to confirm the book's thesis--that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  professional opinionmongers refuse to recognize the work of solitary</i><br>
<i>&gt;  geniuses. But favorable word of mouth over the next two years turned it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  into a bestseller that established Rand as a literary force to be reckoned</i><br>
<i>&gt;  with. By 1962, The Fountainhead had sold half a million hardcover and a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  million paperback copies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;          Craving respect. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Although Rand was gratified by that popular success, her true ambition was</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to win recognition as the author of a distinctly 20th-century--and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  American--philosophy: objectivism. According to its central precept, man is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  a rational being who ought to have no truck with religion or mysticism--in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  particular the spiritual belief that an individual has any "obligation" to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  his fellows. Instead, each person must reason his way to a set of ethical</i><br>
<i>&gt;  values that can be "objectively" known and felt. Under that value system,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the noblest human purpose is to pursue enlightened self-interest, and only</i><br>
<i>&gt;  those who follow that course can emerge as true Randian champions like</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Howard Roark, the architect-hero of The Fountainhead, and John Galt, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  iconoclastic inventor of Atlas Shrugged--the visionary artists and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  entrepreneurs who become the movers and shakers of a nation. If, along the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  way, they provide jobs and inspiration for the masses, then the masses</i><br>
<i>&gt;  should be grateful. But they have no responsibility in any form to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  common good; Rand scorned altruism, warning it was a kind of sloppy</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mass-think that could be perverted into communism or fascism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;          Snubbed by Buckley. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  During her lifetime, Rand's ideas never won the high-ground intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt;  acceptance that she--unlike Howard Roark or John Galt--avidly craved.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Although she became the toast of TV talk shows with Phil Donahue and Tom</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Snyder, academics derided objectivism as grasping and simplistic, and to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  this day Rand followers, like Peikoff, have difficulty landing jobs on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  university faculties. Even among conservatives, Rand received a chilly</i><br>
<i>&gt;  reception, largely because of her defiant atheism. When she first met the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  young William F. Buckley, editor of the conservative National Review and a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  devout Catholic, she shocked him by demanding how such an intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt;  thinker could believe in God. Later, Buckley hired Whittaker Chambers to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  take on Atlas Shrugged. In that scathing critique, Chambers charged that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  from every page "a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  'To a gas chamber--go!' "</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  During the two years before her 1982 death, Rand might have found</i><br>
<i>&gt;  vindication in the election of Ronald Reagan, whose administration seemed a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  tribute to many of her ideals. A handful of her followers, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  domestic-policy director Martin Anderson and senior associate counsel</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Christopher Cox (now a California representative), had won key jobs on his</i><br>
<i>&gt;  White House staff, and Reagan himself claimed to have been inspired by her.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  But compromise--inevitable in politics--was anathema to Rand: Denouncing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Reagan's alliance with the Christian right and his opposition to abortion,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  she refused to vote for him and ended up watching the conservative euphoria</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of the early 1980s from the sidelines.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The Ayn Rand Institute, repository of orthodox objectivism, exists,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ironically, in defiance of Rand's expressed wish. After disbanding the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Nathaniel Branden Institute in the late '60s, Rand refused to bless any</i><br>
<i>&gt;  organization promoting her philosophy. But three years after her death, one</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of her millionaire supporters, Ed Snider, then the majority owner of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Philadelphia Flyers, was shocked by what he considered leftist claptrap</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that his two sons were learning in college. After an abortive attempt to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  set up an objectivist course at the University of Pennsylvania, he</i><br>
<i>&gt;  persuaded Peikoff to start an educational organization, whose funding he</i><br>
<i>&gt;  guaranteed. "I felt, after she died," Snider says, "that if there wasn't an</i><br>
<i>&gt;  organized approach, objectivism would simply fade away." Peikoff, fearing a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  takeover by hostile forces, insisted on total control. Although he has</i><br>
<i>&gt;  since withdrawn from everyday operations to become chairman emeritus, he</i><br>
<i>&gt;  retains veto power on every decision. "I was afraid it would attract</i><br>
<i>&gt;  crackpots," he explains. "We used a variant of the Pepsi-Cola licensing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  agreement to permit no deviations."</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Now based just south of Los Angeles (its Marina Del Rey address is listed</i><br>
<i>&gt;  in every Rand paperback sold), the institute is housed in a high-rise so</i><br>
<i>&gt;  undistinguished that it might well have caused Howard Roark--who dynamites</i><br>
<i>&gt;  a building rather than see its design altered--to reach for a detonator.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Still, the setting seems apt for lionizing a novelist who spent her life</i><br>
<i>&gt;  exalting the triumph of human ingenuity and grit over the obdurate forces</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of nature: Beyond the windows, sailboats litter the world's largest</i><br>
<i>&gt;  man-made small-craft harbor. Inside the lobby, where Rand's photos and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  letters cover the walls, her forbidding steel-hasped desk has pride of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  place. According to the institute's executive director, Michael Berliner, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  59-year-old former professor of the philosophy of education, the aim of his</i><br>
<i>&gt;  current $1.8 million budget is nothing less than "to change the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  intellectual foundations of the culture."</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  To that end, Berliner ticks off the evidence of Rand's increasing ubiquity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  When she died, she had 11 titles in print. Now, she has 15. After releasing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Rand's early short stories, her marginalia, her letters, and, most</i><br>
<i>&gt;  recently, her journals, the institute is overseeing an anthology,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  tentatively called An Ayn Rand Sampler, scheduled for publication next</i><br>
<i>&gt;  year.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;          Is Schwarzenegger available? </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Meanwhile, up the coast in Hollywood, Tony-award-winning producer Craig</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Anderson is currently attempting to recruit Titanic director James Cameron</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to translate the daunting, and didactic, saga of Atlas Shrugged onto film</i><br>
<i>&gt;  in time for the millennium. In the process, Anderson has found himself</i><br>
<i>&gt;  fielding calls from dozens of supplicants, including actress Sharon Stone,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  who have lobbied to work on a classic they claim shaped their lives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  At the Marine Corps' command and staff college in Quantico, Va., James</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Robbins, an associate professor of diplomatic history, has made an</i><br>
<i>&gt;  avocation out of tracking media references to Rand, which he claims are up</i><br>
<i>&gt;  30 percent in the past year. Some, from antifeminist Camille Paglia,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Baltimore Orioles star Brady Anderson, or high-tech tycoon Larry Ellison,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the CEO of Oracle, seem entirely predictable. And few would be surprised</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that Rush Limbaugh has read lengthy chunks of Rand's tirade against</i><br>
<i>&gt;  altruism in Atlas Shrugged over the airwaves. But who might have suspected</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that Hillary Rodham Clinton would confess to a long-ago "Ayn Rand phase"?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;          Rand disciple. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The most highly prized Rand acolyte, but also the most furtive, remains</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan. With the Brandens, Greenspan once</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ranked as an ardent member of the Saturday-night salons in Rand's New York</i><br>
<i>&gt;  apartment that she jokingly dubbed "the collective." Invited to Greenspan's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  swearing-in as the chairman of Gerald Ford's Council of Economic Advisers</i><br>
<i>&gt;  in 1974, she praised him as a "disciple"--a tag he has never publicly</i><br>
<i>&gt;  disclaimed. Peikoff scoffs that a true objectivist would never have taken</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the post Greenspan now holds as the nation's chief banking czar. Still,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  friends insist that Greenspan never abandoned his Randian ideals and assert</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that he finally exposed them in a speech last April when he essentially</i><br>
<i>&gt;  advocated the abolition of his job and similar regulatory interferences</i><br>
<i>&gt;  with the economy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  But the principal target of the Ayn Rand Institute has always been</i><br>
<i>&gt;  adolescent readers, who have demonstrated a striking affinity for Rand's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  books. "Ayn Rand is speaking to what an adolescent is dealing with: Who am</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I? What does it mean to be independent?" Berliner says. Since 1986, more</i><br>
<i>&gt;  than 55,000 high school students have been induced to read and opine on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Rand's Anthem or The Fountainhead through two institute essay contests</i><br>
<i>&gt;  offering up to $10,000 in prize money. Berliner's staff has also promoted</i><br>
<i>&gt;  objectivist clubs at more than 100 college campuses across the country.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Last April the institute set out to raise its profile with an op-ed article</i><br>
<i>&gt;  by staff writer David Harriman attacking the volunteer summit hosted in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Philadelphia by Colin Powell, Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Jimmy Carter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Titled "Selfishness Made America Great," the article compared Clinton's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  appeal for volunteerism to the call for citizen service once issued by</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Adolf Hitler. When conservative columnist Arianna Huffington launched a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  swift counterattack, Berliner knew he had hit upon a cause tailor made for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  promoting the author who penned The Virtue of Selfishness. Over the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Internet, the institute recruited 40 students to show up in Philadelphia</i><br>
<i>&gt;  brandishing customized placards protesting, "Clinton Wants Your Life" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "Don't Volunteer Me." The ensuing publicity caused contributions to shoot</i><br>
<i>&gt;  up 30 percent--a development that would have delighted the philosopher</i><br>
<i>&gt;  queen of capitalism, who was buried beside a 6-foot floral dollar sign.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Now the institute has launched a $66,000 campaign to capture more space on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the nation's op-ed pages with equally provocative stands. But not</i><br>
<i>&gt;  surprisingly, its newfound notoriety has caused dissent. On a crest high</i><br>
<i>&gt;  above Beverly Hills, in an imposing white, art-deco palazzo that Howard</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Roark might have approved, Nathaniel Branden laments the institute's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  targeting the volunteer summit. "It confirms the worst accusations of her</i><br>
<i>&gt;  enemies," he says. "I'm appalled."</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Another Rand acolyte who has become disenchanted with Peikoff and the Ayn</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Rand Institute is Ed Snider, its onetime sugar daddy, who discreetly cut</i><br>
<i>&gt;  his ties nearly seven years ago and now helps fund a second objectivist</i><br>
<i>&gt;  institute in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. For Snider, the final straw came when</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Peikoff and board chairman Peter Schwartz excommunicated David Kelley, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  former Vassar philosophy professor who had read Rand's favorite poem,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Rudyard Kipling's "If," at her funeral. In 1989, Kelley committed what</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Peikoff and Schwartz considered an act of unpardonable deviationism: He</i><br>
<i>&gt;  spoke at a New York meeting of the Laissez Faire Supper Club, a gathering</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of libertarians. If any political philosophy would seem to echo Ayn Rand's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  beliefs, it would be libertarianism, and indeed, according to Robert Poole,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  president of the movement's Los Angeles-based Reason Foundation, he and a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  majority of his members claim her as their inspiration. But Rand denounced</i><br>
<i>&gt;  libertarians as anarchists--enemies of reason who wanted not less</i><br>
<i>&gt;  government but no government at all. She herself believed a minimalist</i><br>
<i>&gt;  state was necessary to safeguard individual rights through the courts, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  police, and the army. With some libertarians calling for decriminalization</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of drug laws and openly puffing pot, Rand spurned the lot as "hippies of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the right."</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  For the Ayn Rand Institute, Kelley's decision to consort with such</i><br>
<i>&gt;  apostates was an act of treason. He was attacked in the institute's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  newsletter, and his writings were expunged from its catalog. In his own</i><br>
<i>&gt;  pamphlet of reply, Kelley raged that "This is the behavior of religious</i><br>
<i>&gt;  zealots." In 1990, he founded the rival Institute for Objectivist Studies</i><br>
<i>&gt;  in Poughkeepsie, where he attracted Snider and other defectors from the Ayn</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Rand Institute. Last October, as they joined the libertarians at the Cato</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Institute to fete Atlas Shrugged, the occasion took on the air of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  dissident convention.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  What would Rand have made of that tribute? According to Peikoff, she would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  have deplored it. Holed up in his suburban brick ranch house in Irvine,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Calif., a maroon convertible with AYN RAND license plates parked in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  driveway, Peikoff remains defiantly unrepentant about his break with Kelley</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and other infidels, no matter what opportunity for Randian hype and hoopla</i><br>
<i>&gt;  their Washington celebration offered. "I'm an ideological purist," he says,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  sounding remarkably like a character who has just stepped off Rand's pages.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "I'd rather blow up the whole movement than ally myself with this slime."</i><br>
