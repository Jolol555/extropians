<i>&gt;You will, I presume, explain why I somehow have responsibility for </i><br>
<i>&gt;the actions of fifteen idiots.  And why that 'badge of shame' also</i><br>
<i>&gt;applies to those transhumanists who backed you up?</i><br>
<p>
It applies because they applied it to themselves--the concept came up<br>
in the correspondence with me during that time.  They did not want<br>
the entirety of transhumanist thought to be painted with such a<br>
patina of intolerance.   They decided to take responsibility for a<br>
large part of the situation, even though they were not the<br>
perpetrators.  While I strugged with the present harassment, they<br>
were looking toward the future of transhumanist thought and what<br>
direction it might take if I left the list.  I deeply respect them <br>
for the decision that they made to take on a difficult task.<br>
