Interesting story! Checking out your site now. A question for you - How do<br>
you think your technology would have fared in a market without any gov't<br>
subsidies? Why wouldn't the short-sight human nature to buy cheapest now,<br>
instead of cheapest long-term been even more strongly expressed?<br>

You're right about city-based wheat farming being untenable - But don't<br>
think grains - think produce. That's where people spend most of their food<br>
$$$. Small-scale veg farming is quite attainable -m(b)illions do it all the<br>
time.<br>
