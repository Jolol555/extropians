Selling a new series to US TV companies is almost impossible these days<br>
unless you have a track record, and Hollywood doesn't seem too interested<br>
in movies with anything unusual to say.<br>
<p>

<p>
I think that's the only way, and some of us are already working on it. I'm<br>
working with a group who are trying to put together a kind of anti-Roswell,<br>
anti-X-Files comedy on a low budget (without direct parody). If it works <br>
out then hopefully I can start making more 'serious' transhumanist movies afterwards (I have a very rough idea for a pro-SI 'propaganda' piece, but <br>
we'd need a few million to make it properly).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We should also ry to penetrate other markets.  The Latin American</i><br>
<i>&gt;TV market, from what I've heard, is the fastest growing.  Potential?</i><br>
<p>
Now the Hong Kong movie industry seems to be going down the tubes,<br>
the Asian market might be another good idea. They certainly have<br>
a taste for the bizarre (e.g. this morning I was watching 'Sex and<br>
Zen', a comedy about a 16th century scholar who decides Buddhist <br>
abstinence isn't for him and gets a transplant from a horse) and <br>
Japanese movies often have a transhumanist bent. Of course the<br>
Chinese takeover of Hong Kong might destroy much of the market<br>
as well.<br>
