I'd vote for the reality of the first six (he did have the metaprogramming<br>
circuit as number six rather than seven, didn't he?), but I'm pretty<br>
dubious about the others, except in the most limited sense. In many<br>
respects I preferred John Lilly's model (in 'Center of the Cyclone') for<br>
the region beyond the fourth circuit.<br>
<p>
BTW, those interested in this subject should probably also read Lilly's<br>
book 'Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer', which<br>
is on the Web somewhere. It's a bit of a tough read in places, but it has<br>
a lot of interesting background information.<br>

P.S. I'd also strongly agree with Anders' statement a few days ago about<br>
the dangers of careless alteration of motivational systems.<br>
