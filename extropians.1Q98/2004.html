Helping paraplegics to walk <br>
 <br>
Scientists work on device that would bypass spinal cord <br>
 <br>

PHILADELPHIA, Feb 17 — A small device implanted in the brain that sends<br>
signals to the arms and legs, bypassing the spinal cord, may soon allow<br>
paraplegics to walk. A patient would only have to think, “I would like to<br>
move my leg forward,” and the device would do the rest, a California<br>
researcher said. <br>
 <br>
          <br>
      <br>
     <br>
            <br>

         THE DEVICE, which would look rather like the head of a toothbrush<br>
— a mount with electrodes as its bristles — would work similarly to a<br>
cellular phone, sending signals to other electrodes implanted in the<br>
patient’s nerves or muscles.<br>
       A new understanding of brain circuitry is allowing scientist to<br>
develop the device, said Dr. Richard Andersen of the California Institute<br>
of Technology.<br>
       Similar prostheses are already being used to help people who are<br>
deaf, he said. By stimulating different auditory nerves, the smart brains<br>
are helping patients to lip-read more easily.<br>
       The new device for paraplegics is growing out of Andersen’s work on<br>
the physical organization of the brain.<br>
       Using imaging scans called MRIs to record blood flow in the brain of<br>
monkeys, Andersen pinpointed the part of the brain that codes for<br>
intentions. In contrast to previous beliefs, he found that movement and the<br>
intention to perform a movement are controlled by different parts of the<br>
brain.<br>
       To make sure human brains work the same way, his team then tried the<br>
experiment on themselves, hooking themselves up to brain tracing devices<br>
and MRIs. When they only moved their eyes, they were able to detect an eye<br>
movement area — signaling intention — in one particular region of the<br>
brain, he said. Similarly, when they reached their arms out, they found an<br>
area in the brain that corresponded to the intention to move their arm.<br>
       That’s what gave them the idea for the brain prostheses for people<br>
with spinal cord injuries, Andersen said at a scientific meeting here.<br>
       As the California researcher envisions it, a 6mm by 3mm array of<br>
electrodes about the width of human hair would be implanted under the<br>
brain’s surface. The wires, which are attached to a transmitter, would send<br>
radio-type signals to other electrodes implanted in the muscles and nerves<br>
of the arms or legs. Normally, the spinal cord carries such signals from<br>
the brain to the rest of the body.<br>
       “We’re only talking about crude movements,” Andersen said, but it’s<br>
better than any system that has been developed to date.<br>
       Animal tests are about to begin, with human testing just years off.<br>
“We’re over all the major hurdles,” Andersen said, explaining that the time<br>
is needed for development.<br>
       The prostheses are being developed in conjunction with the<br>
Huntington Memorial Research Institute in Pasadena.<br>
