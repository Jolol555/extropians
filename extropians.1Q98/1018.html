<i>&gt; The beginning state of the brain (at least before birth, </i><br>
<i>&gt; or better, before any actual inputs arrive) we should </i><br>
<i>&gt; in principle be able to deduct from the information </i><br>
<i>&gt; stored in the DNA. (The DNA contains about 10^10 bits)</i><br>
<p>
I think this is wrong, since the genetic information is just the basic<br>
rules to grow the brain, the exact structure is laid down in an<br>
emergent fashion most likely very dependent on the environment; brain<br>
growth creates information.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Assumed we would connect all sensory nerves to a computer. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Assumed the steps of the DACs are sufficiently small to </i><br>
<i>&gt; not be noticed by the brain. The question then is: </i><br>
<i>&gt; how much information per unit of time do I need to </i><br>
<i>&gt; simulate the real life environment of a human individual </i><br>
<i>&gt; in such a way that his brain will not notice the difference. </i><br>
<p>
A quick and rough estimate (I can get real numbers with some effort,<br>
but right now I'm lazy) is that there are around 2 million axons from<br>
the eyes, around 6 million axons in the spinal cord, one million axons<br>
in the auditory nerves and lets add one million for the rest of the<br>
brain nerves. That makes 10 million axons of sensory information. The<br>
normal activity for neurons lie beneath 1 KHz, so an upper bound on<br>
the input would be 10 billion bits/s.<br>
<p>
That makes around 10^14-10^15 bits per day, or 10 terabytes. This is<br>
most likely a big overestimate (neural activity is sparse, there are<br>
lots of correlations in the input etc). Over a lifetime that would be<br>
10^18-10^19 bits. This is an upper estimate of the human capacity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; An information input of 50 gigabytes per day results </i><br>
<i>&gt; in a total of approximately 10^16 bits after an average </i><br>
<i>&gt; human life time. The 10^10 of the DNA are much less and </i><br>
<i>&gt; can thus be neglected.</i><br>
<p>
But we do not store this flood of information, in fact most of it is<br>
quickly removed. Only the salient information is retained and<br>
amplified in the brain, and it is from this we learn. Of course, we do<br>
not have good figures of how much this is.<br>
<p>
My personal estimate for the human capacity is around a bit per<br>
synapse (based on assumptions from neural networks), there are around<br>
10^14 synapses, making a capacity of around 10^14 bits. <br>
