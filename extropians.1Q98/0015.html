<p>
Casting this in less threatening terms, suppose you have a choice of two<br>
societies to live in, one where you and everyone else voluntarily agrees<br>
to allow themselves to be scanned whenever a crime has been committed in<br>
order to decide who did it, and one where no such technology is used.<br>
Which would you prefer to live in?<br>
<p>
There is no need to argue that someone's refusal to be scanned is<br>
illegitimate.  They may have their own personal or religious reasons for<br>
not wanting their mind to be accessed in this way, and they are willing<br>
to tolerate an increased crime rate as the cost for maintaining this<br>
aspect of their privacy.  Each person's preferences can be accommodated.<br>
<p>
As a practical matter, there would have to be some barriers to moving<br>
between the two societies, so that one could not commit a crime in one<br>
world and move to the other to escape detection.  Maybe there would<br>
be a time delay or some considerable amount of red tape involved, or<br>
perhaps emigrants from the scanning world would be required to submit<br>
one last time to the machine to ascertain that they are not fleeing<br>
after commiting a crime.<br>
<p>
These worlds could be space stations, virtual realities, or even different<br>
regions of the earth.  The requirement is that it should be difficult to<br>
commit a crime in one world from the other one, so that people who agree<br>
to the scanning benefit from the reduced crime rate.<br>
