I think Damien wrote this:<br>
<i>&gt;I think I've read that Old English originally had another word meaning 'male</i><br>
<i>&gt;humans' and that 'man' was originally restricted to its inclusive sense, like</i><br>
<p>
Ancient Greek possessed three genders:  masculine, feminine and<br>
neuter. When the resulting Latin grammer was superimposed over the<br>
Germanic roots of early English a few centuries ago, these three<br>
genders passed into English but not to the extent that other<br>
languages utilize them.  English is actually one of the more<br>
gender-neutral languages, and is highly flexible in accomodating<br>
non-gendered discourse.  The word that you are trying to remember<br>
probably came from a Germanic or Icelandic language, because Old<br>
English vocabulary bore a closer resemblance to the root languages,<br>
both in form and pronunciation, and most of our 'household words'<br>
(words that refer to practical objects) entered the language through<br>
repeated invasion by Germanic and Icelandic tribes.  But 'man' as a<br>
word did not enter the English language until the Middle English<br>
period, and I can find no evidence that it was restricted to the<br>
inclusive 'human'.  It actually had four or five meanings, many of <br>
which you will find in Shakespeare.<br>
<p>
I myself prefer to utilize the word 'human', as it precisely shows<br>
what stage of evolutionary development I am talking about:  Human,<br>
transhuman, posthuman.<br>
