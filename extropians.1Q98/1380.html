As some of you  already know, there have beed discussions about <br>
creating a World Tranhumanist Association. The good news is that <br>
we have now reached the stage where we can make an inofficial <br>
announcement and invite participation from the transhumanist <br>
community. Together we have a unique pool of talents that I hope will <br>
make this a big success and allow us to have an impact :-)<br>

---------------------------------------------------<br>
MISSION STATEMENT<br>
The WTA was founded in 1998 with the aim of turning transhumanism <br>
into a mainstream academic discipline. The WTA seeks to promote <br>
research into the science and philosophy of the future; to encourage <br>
reasoned debate; and to facilitate the exchange of ideas between <br>
researchers on all transhumanist themes. We work to increase public <br>
awareness of the benefits, but also the risks, of the technologies by <br>
which humanity will seek to overcome its biological limitations.<br>
<p>
The WTA publishes the Journal of Transhumanism; organizes conferences;<br>
promotes informed media coverage; provides information resources on<br>
its web pages; and supports networking within the transhumanist<br>
community.<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
We need members (membership will be free) but above all we need <br>
persons who want to take an active part in shaping the WTA. The <br>
content is still very preliminary. The WTA web site will be at <br>
<a href="http://www.transhumanism.com;">http://www.transhumanism.com;</a> it is under construction but you can <br>
already find more information about the WTA there.<br>
<p>
If you want to get actively involved, please send me an email. At the <br>
moment we are especially looking for persons who can take <br>
responsibility for some part of the web pages, assist in the graphic <br>
design, create a WTA logo, or implement features such as mailing <br>
lists and threaded discussion archives.<br>
<p>
I will continue to post updates on how the WTA develops... (I am <br>
quite excited about this...)<br>
