I D'ohed:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  IDENTITY: X possesses an identity and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  can therefore be said to exist where</i><br>
<i>&gt;  X stands out as different from some </i><br>
<i>&gt;  state or quantity defined as not-X.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  NOT-IDENTITY: X posses no identity and </i><br>
<i>&gt;  cannot be said to exist where X is the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  same as not-X, for there is then nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that is not-X, and thus no difference.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Ooops. I included the term defined<br>
  in the definition. No matter, it does<br>
  not mark an error of essence, since<br>
  the same definition can be stated<br>
  more properly sans term:<br>
<p>
<p>
IDENTITY: that which is possessed by X <br>
which makes X different than not-X, <br>
allowing it to be said that X exists.<br>
<p>
NOT-IDENTITY: that which makes X the <br>
same as not-X, which nullifies that <br>
which allows X to be said to exit.<br>
<p>
<p>
 Any other definitional suggestions?<br>
 I like the "process" definitions above<br>
 more, even though they include the term.<br>
<p>
 A perfect example of the "not-identity"<br>
 of "same as," and of the second "not"<br>
 definition above, is an item X that <br>
 appears one second -- and as such stands<br>
 as different than not-X -- then disappears<br>
 the next second, "poof"... in so doing it <br>
 has become the same as not-X, and thus X<br>
 ceases to exist. The prevailing definition <br>
 of identity is "same as," and yet as we can <br>
 see, that definition is most clearly false. <br>
<p>
 Another example is identical, or "same as," <br>
 twins: seeing only one at a time, you cannot<br>
 be sure which of the two your seeing, since<br>
 each looses identity to the degree that the<br>
 two are the "same as" each other. So we can<br>
 clearly see that "same as" = "ANTI-identity."<br>
<p>
 IDENTITY RULE: X gains identity by <br>
 difference and looses it by similarity.<br>
