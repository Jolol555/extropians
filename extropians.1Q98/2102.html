<i>| I am no fan of immigration quotas, because I'm a big believer in the free</i><br>
<i>| market.  However, the so-called "high-tech labor shortage" is more horseshit</i><br>
<i>| than reality.  The basic fact is, most high-tech managers can't accept the</i><br>
<i>| fact that their "underlings" are actually worth more than they are, and</i><br>
<i>| therefore are unwilling to pay them what they're worth.  That's the</i><br>
<i>| foundation of this "labor shortage".  These clowns (managers) are just</i><br>
<i>| looking for cheap labor, so they can pay them less than they're worth, and</i><br>
<i>| they're worth a lot more than them.</i><br>
<p>
I agree here.  The responses are predictable by the law of supply and demand.<br>
Microsoft wants to increase the supply of labor so they can pay them less.<br>
Let's face it -- if the US gave a green card to every programmer in the world,<br>
MS would still claim there is a labor shortage.  IEEE, representing labor,<br>
wants to limit the supply to labor to increase its costs.<br>
<p>
The following generalizations are based on my experiences at several companies<br>
over a long period, and the experiences of many of my associates.<br>
<p>
1. Many managers underestimate the flexibility of engineers to learning new<br>
   skills.  This is especially true in the "Human Resources" departments.<br>
   For instance, if a company is looking for someone to program in language<br>
   Z, a CS major who knows A, B and C, but not Z, is going to have trouble<br>
   convincing the suit that he can pick up Z quickly, even though A, B, and C<br>
   are similar to Z and most programming languages have similar concepts.<br>
   The suit doesn't know any better, and can't tell whether the interviewee<br>
   has a valid argument or is just B.S.-ing to get the job.  After all, if the<br>
   suit knew enough to know the difference, the company would move him over<br>
   to the programming groups (after all, there *is* a "labor shortage,"<br>
   remember?).  The suit will probably say, "sorry, we're specifically<br>
   looking for someone who knows Z, and you don't know Z."<br>
<p>
2. Let's say Z is new, and the market has decided this is the new "hot"<br>
   technology every company just *has* to have.  Existing employees probably<br>
   don't know Z, because they started working for the company before Z<br>
   became "hot," or even before Z was invented.  The managers won't take<br>
   the engineers aside, throw them a few good books on Z and tell them to<br>
   take a week off and learn Z, because that would divert them from their<br>
   current assignments, which are probably behind schedule (because of the<br>
   "labor shortage," no doubt), and also because of point #1 above.<br>
   Instead, they whine that their current employees are useless because<br>
   they don't know Z, and they need to look for the lucky percentage of<br>
   New College Graduages (NCG's) who happened to learn Z in their class,<br>
   rather than X or Y.<br>
