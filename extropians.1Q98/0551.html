The catch is that with very minor variations in these physical <br>
constants it wouldn't be "life" that is impossible, but some more <br>
basic phenomena.<br>
<p>
Such as the periodic table.<br>
<p>
Increase the nuclear forces a bit in relation to the electromagnetic <br>
force, and relatively small stars rapidly convert from hydrogen <br>
clouds to neutronium.  Neutronium stars tend not to go nova and <br>
distribute heavy elements.<br>
<p>
Decrease them a bit, and stars don't light -- so fusion doesn't <br>
happen -- so heavy elements don't get distributed.<br>
<p>
A "periodic table" that consists of hydrogen, or hydrogen and <br>
neutronium, doesn't deserve to be called a periodic table.  And life <br>
would be pretty difficult to achieve in such a universe.<br>
<p>
The balance between the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear <br>
force is pretty critical too.<br>
