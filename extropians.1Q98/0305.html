<i>&gt;Mark conflates morality and law.  I believe the two are distinct.  &gt;There are</i><br>
<i>&gt;acts</i><br>
<i>&gt;which are immoral which should not be illegal, such as smoking.  &gt;Smoking is</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-destructive -- yet it should not be outlawed.  Under a rational &gt;morality,</i><br>
<i>&gt;smoking would be wrong, but no police officer would come knocking at &gt;your</i><br>
<i>&gt;door if you smoked.  Ditto for overeating, lack of exercise, most drug &gt;use.</i><br>
<p>
I don't agree with you that smoking is immoral. I view it as a choice <br>
that people make which is stupid. The same with overeating, etc. As an <br>
extropian, I am obviously interested in extending my lifespan. However, <br>
I do not take things to extremes. I am not on a 10 per cent fat, 1200 <br>
calorie a day diet even though that might give me a few more years. I <br>
like having a chocolate chip cookie once in a while. Does that make my <br>
actions immoral? One problem with your definition of morality is that I <br>
am unsure where you draw the line. Is any action which does not serve to <br>
extend your life immoral?<br>
<p>
In my view morality , like good manners, only comes into play when you <br>
are relating to other people. A person on a desert island can be stupid <br>
and self-destructive, but he can neither be rude nor immoral. <br>
Immorality, in my view, involves the use of force or fraud against <br>
others. This, I think, is a rather simple and easy to understand <br>
definition. <br>
<p>
I really don't like being called immoral because, say, I eat a box of <br>
chocolate chip cookies. (By the way, I am slim.) I think that really <br>
trivializes the word. I think immoral should be equated with evil, such <br>
as murder, rape, theft and mayhem. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Rational morality cannot be forced.  It must be spread by persuasion.  &gt;The</i><br>
<i>&gt;only time force can be used is when someone initiates or threatens to</i><br>
<i>&gt;initiate force.  Then it is just a matter of defense or just &gt;retaliation.</i><br>
<p>
Daniel, we disagree on the definition of morality. I agree that bad <br>
personal habits should be no concern of the law and attempts to change <br>
others should only be accomplished by persuasion UNLESS they violate the <br>
rights of others. <br>
