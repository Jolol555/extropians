Here's some text used to sell a video from R.Hoagland's website, for<br>
those who didn't feel like launching netscape during email, it may<br>
appear to be flakey (if not entertaining) but its worth checking out:<br>
<p>
On February 28, 1992, at the invitation of a United Nations staff<br>
special interest group (SIG), Richard C. Hoagland took his case to the<br>
U.N. Speaking before hundreds of U.N. staff, delegates and invited press<br>
and guests, Hoagland extends his intelligence hypothesis concerning the<br>
mystery of Cydonia, to planet Earth: demonstrating that the same<br>
mathematical  message encoded in the layout of the ruins on Mars is also<br>
found at many of the mysterious ruins on this planet. With many stunning<br>
slides and film clips, Hoagland shares his insights into a new science<br>
of "fourth dimensional physics" gleaned from the Cydonia research, a<br>
physics that opens the door to unlimited energy sources that could<br>
revolutionize our technologies, if not  change the way we think about<br>
the universe itself. The last 24 minutes of Vol. 2 contain an analysis<br>
of the extraordinary footage, captured by NASA on September 15, 1991,<br>
when the U.S. space shuttle Discovery recorded what appears to be<br>
UFO-like spacecraft cruising over the Indian Ocean at enormous speeds,<br>
turning at right angles and accelerating to several hundred thousand<br>
miles per hour after being "shot at" by two missile-like flashes,<br>
violating all current laws of physics. The fact that this video was<br>
broadcast live over NASA's own satellite channel (NASA Select), leads us<br>
to believe that this was a "U.S. black budget" project, test leaked from<br>
the highest offices at NASA -- despite NASA's current claim that the<br>
film shows only "ice crystals from a waste water dump". Shortly after<br>
this video was aired, the head of NASA, former astronaut and commander<br>
of the first U.S. S. Enterprise space shuttle, Admiral Richard Truly,<br>
was abruptly fired. Hoagland believes that he and his associates have an<br>
important inside track on what this striking video really represents,<br>
given the "hyperdimensional" physics found encoded in the ruins of<br>
Cydonia. Once you see this video, you will be convinced that this is the<br>
"smoking gun" that proves that something extraordinary has been<br>
happening in the solar system, if not on planet Earth, for a long, long<br>
time . . . something that up until now, we have not been "permitted" to<br>
know. Question: now that we do know -- what do we plan to do about it?<br>
