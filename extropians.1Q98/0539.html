That's reality.  Welcome to the real world, Erik! :)<br>
Seriously, there are only three ways to live.  Either one produces,<br>
is on charity, or steals.  There are no other ways, but I have<br>
absolutely no problem with the first two (and what's more, I<br>
really don't think Michael does either).<br>

Actually, most 'poor people' are poor *because* of government<br>
interference.  Some may not care enough to work for a living,<br>
but I think they're in the minority (or would be if institutionalized<br>
theft didn't support them), and it is their right to choose to not<br>
produce anything.  It is *not* their right to force me, Michael, and<br>
you to support them.<br>
