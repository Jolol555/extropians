<i>&gt; From:          CALYK &lt;CALYK@aol.com&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; Isn't it blindingly obvious that any major advance in energy production,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  which would instantly make a millionaire out of the first guy to get to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the patent office, can't possibly be "supressed" by anyone, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  larger the corporation, the /less/ likely it is that there will be leaks.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Hell, Texaco couldn't even keep secret that one of their executives</i><br>
<i>&gt;  referred to black employees as "black jelly beans".  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; i dont think its a secret, ive heard that oil companies have bought and hold</i><br>
<i>&gt; dozens of patents for alternatives that would make things better for us, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; make the oil companies lose money, and the same for the car companies, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; alternative engines etc...   Ill try and find some examples... as for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; light bulbs, i read an article on it.</i><br>
<p>
I've heard numerous stories along this line.<br>
<p>
There is one essential fact:<br>
<p>
**ALL** US patents are a matter of public record unless **THE US <br>
GOVERNMENT** has stepped in and classified them.<br>
<p>
If you hear a story about an oil company suppressing a patent for a <br>
highly efficient engine, there are three possibilities:<br>
<p>
(1) the story is true, the patent is on file and publically <br>
accessible, and someone should produce the patent number so that <br>
anyone can confirm the story -- failure to do so is careless <br>
rumor-mongering.<br>
<p>
(2) the story is true and THE US GOVERNMENT -- not an oil company -- <br>
is suppressing it.<br>
<p>
(3) the story is false, at least to the extent that no such device <br>
was patented.<br>
<p>
Considering that the first such story I heard was from my father and <br>
alleged that the high-performance high-mileage engine was developed <br>
in the early 1960s, I am quite certain that at least some of these <br>
patents (if they ever existed) have expired by now.  They would still <br>
be on file and it would now be legal for anyone to start producing <br>
them without any licensing requirements or royalties.<br>
<p>
There's another twist to that.  It was a standing joke in the Soviet <br>
Union that said country's greatest inventor was Comrade Reguspatoff.  <br>
If you wonder at the joke, let me add a bit of punctuation to the <br>
comrade's name:<br>
          Reg.  U.S. Pat. Off.<br>
If such super-engines, super-carburetors, etc.  were on file with the <br>
US patent office, we *would* see them in Soviet-made military <br>
vehicles.<br>
<p>
We don't.<br>
<p>
Unless you assume that the global news media are also in on this <br>
conspiracy to keep these things from us.<br>
