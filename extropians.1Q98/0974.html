Given how well the meme of memetics spreads, he seems to have been<br>
quite right.<br>

<p>
Yes, I would be surprised if there were no cognitive parasites or<br>
selfish replicators even among uploads; it is a big ecological niche<br>
where there are already prototypes.<br>
<p>
Making backups and reboots of Jupiter brains is an interesting<br>
problem. Some RAID scheme might help preserve the data, but what do<br>
you do when the central cognitive systems have been messed up? It<br>
would be a mixture between system operations and psychology, on a<br>
posthuman level.<br>
<p>
Apropos replicators and jupiter brains (and rebooting of them), I<br>
recommend Charles Stross' novel _Scratch Monkey_ (on the net at<br>
<a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/monkey/index.html">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/monkey/index.html</a>) for one<br>
look at the problem of expanding into an uploaded state where<br>
selection pressures (for access to computing resources) become<br>
significant. I don't really agree with his "ecological succession",<br>
but it is a fun (if very dark) read.<br>
