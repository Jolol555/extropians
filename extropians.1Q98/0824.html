I think you need to use some energy temporarily, although you should be<br>
able to recover it.<br>
<p>
It may be that the universe expansion is worse than I thought.<br>
Consider that the computer must, as time goes on, be composed more<br>
and more of empty space, since the density of space is decreasing<br>
(exponentially?).  We must signal from one side to the other by sending<br>
something that takes energy, whether gravitational radiation, photons,<br>
or particles.  Suppose we send a particle.  The problem may be that if we<br>
give the particle too small an initial speed, that it never gets there.<br>
It loses ground due to the universe expanding out from under it, and at<br>
some point it actually starts to go backwards.  This means that there<br>
is a certain minimum energy necessary for this kind of signalling, and<br>
that minimum energy will increase as the structure grows larger.<br>
<p>
I'm not 100% sure about this but Tipler describes a more moderate effect<br>
like this in a closed universe, and it should be worse in an open one.<br>
Also it's not clear how this generalizes to the other forms of signalling,<br>
but maybe something similar happens.<br>
