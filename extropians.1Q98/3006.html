Given the recent list discussion involving Cuba some may be interested in<br>
a current short article in Forbes magazine. Of course, Forbes calls itself<br>
the Capitalist Tool and so, no doubt, some readers will feel that the<br>
objectivity of the magazine is compromised by an activist agenda. In any<br>
case, the chart depicting changing per capita GDP is interesting and if it<br>
is accurate it is rather pathetic.<br>

The cost of Castro <br>
<p>
By Peter Brimelow<br>
<p>
begin excerpt<br>
<p>
WHAT IS THE COST of Castro? Communist economies are notoriously tricky to<br>
estimate, but it appears that Cuba's inflation-adjusted per capita income<br>
has actually fallen since Fidel Castro's revolution in 1959. In dramatic<br>
contrast, Florida, just 90 miles to the north, has boomed—as have other<br>
Sunbelt states like Texas and Arizona. Their revolution was<br>
air-conditioning. And it worked. <br>
<p>
To estimate the cost of Castro, we assume that Cuba's current per capita<br>
output should be about the same proportion of Florida's output as it was in<br>
1959. This gives us a current figure ($4,169), more than three times higher<br>
than Cuba's actual output ($1,300), modestly placed between that of Jamaica<br>
($3,200) and of Mexico ($7,700). <br>
<p>
In fact, Cuba would probably have done considerably better than this. A<br>
1956 U.S. Department of Commerce guide for businessmen flatly said that<br>
"Cuba is not an underdeveloped country in the sense usually associated with<br>
that term," citing its infrastructure, industrial development and large<br>
middle class. Its living standards were reported to be among the highest in<br>
Latin America—then. <br>
<p>
A hint of what might have been: Even troubled Mexico's per capita GDP has<br>
closed in on the U.S. quite considerably over the last four decades—from<br>
less than an eighth in 1959 to about a third recently. Still, our modest<br>
estimate suggests that the shortfall in Cuban GDP as a result of Castro was<br>
a hefty $31.5 billion in 1995. <br>
<p>
In the language of takeover artists, Cuba is an underperforming asset. Not<br>
all of this value could be realized immediately, of course—but enough to<br>
suggest it would be well worthwhile to offer Fidel a very golden handshake<br>
(say $5 billion) to retire to Spain. <br>
<p>
Or maybe one of his middle managers may try an LRO—leveraged rubout? <br>
