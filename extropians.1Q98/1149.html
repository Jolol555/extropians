Dunno if this is true or walrus-shit.  I searched hither &amp; yon on the net,<br>
couldn't find any substantiation:<br>

An AP story today reported two scientists at the Charleston<br>
Oceanographic Institute have successfully genetically engineered the<br>
first mammal hybrid.  The Scientists, Dr. Lisa Velasquez and Dr.<br>
Michael Poczkinsky, used bits of genetic material from both a<br>
bottle-nosed dolphin and the egg of a walrus, fertilized in vitro, and<br>
implanted into an adult walrus for gestation.  The healthy offspring,<br>
termed a "Dolrus", seems healthy and is now three months old.<br>
Phenotypically, it has the features of a somewhat larger dolphin, only<br>
it is able to carry itself out of the water and locomote on land.  The<br>
Dolrus appears to have the breathing apparatus of the dolphin, but<br>
preliminary study seems to show tusks will develop much like the<br>
walrus.<br>
