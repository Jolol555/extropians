<i>&gt; &gt; continuing the violence you have been TRAINED to perpetrate?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My point was that the fact that my father hit me a few of times (and on</i><br>

<i>&gt; person.</i><br>
<p>
What we do know is that most violent people were treated violently as<br>
children. I agree that occasional punishment as you describe is unlikely<br>
to be harmful, and my point is that there are often better alternatives.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(Actually, even most kids who really are abused do not turn</i><br>

<p>
Go back and read Alice Miller. I am not convinced that decisions made in<br>
childhood represent true choices.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm very happy you never</i><br>
<i>&gt; have hit your kids. Good for you. However, do you really think your</i><br>
<i>&gt; child rearing methods will work with any and all kids? </i><br>
<p>
I only have to deal with a single case here, which works.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At any rate, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea that giving a kid a few whacks on the bottom once in a while</i><br>
<i>&gt; (especially after the kid has been really bad, in this case he</i><br>
<i>&gt; practically killed the family pet!) "perpetuates a cycle of violence" is</i><br>
<i>&gt; just one of those cliches</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I really don't find any empirical support for.</i><br>
<p>
Your posting certainly had the rhetoric which comes from those who<br>
espouse abuse as justified.... So I reponded to that. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How do you explain</i><br>
<i>&gt; the low crime rates in the U.S. from 1932-60 when many, if not most,</i><br>
<i>&gt; parents were giving their kids an occasional spanking?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I think violence statistics have many more causes than occasional<br>
spanking. I can't remember the logical fallacy here, does someone on the<br>
list know the name of it??<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, I really don't understand people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; think that parents who have a different philosophy of discipline than</i><br>
<i>&gt; they do are evil monsters who are turning their kids into sociopaths.</i><br>
<p>
I think you are reading more into my post that what I was saying.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; By the way, I don't have kids. "Good", I'm sure you are thinking , Mr.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ra.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Well if you ever do so, be sure to examine the nonviolent child rearing<br>
options available so you don't have to whack them...<br>
