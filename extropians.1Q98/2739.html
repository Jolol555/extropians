<i>&gt; There are, 'less I'm mistaken, three policies for punishment in most</i><br>
<i>&gt; societies: deterrence, revenge, and prevention. These are usually applied</i><br>
<i>&gt; in combination, rather than in isolation, and the mechanism by which </i><br>
<i>&gt; they are applied, and severity, varies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Firstly, deterrence. This is pretty much disproven as an approach to</i><br>
<i>&gt; preventing crime; punishment doesn't deter criminals because criminals</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't expect to be caught and punished. </i><br>
<p>
Maybe, but there will always be *some* would-be criminals that are deterred<br>
by strict sentencing, and every crime prevented, counts. Also, I'm quite sure<br>
that mild punishments make criminals loathe the justice system and may thus<br>
increase crime. Some people just need a firm hand to keep them on track.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Secondly, there's revenge. I am not going to try to justify revenge; I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think it's a ridiculous, obscene and unpleasant notion that degrades </i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody involved. </i><br>
<p>
Not only do I strongly disagree on an emotional level, but I daresay that<br>
the need for revenge is in fact *useful* because it helps you to terminate<br>
your enemies and therefore thrive. The need for revenge is almost universal <br>
in humans, which is a strong indication that it can't be too bad a trait.<br>
<p>
Example: a lion kills a member of a group of humans. Unlike dumb herbivores<br>
(for example) they likely won't just accept the loss and go on, but they'll<br>
want to punish that lion, and lions in general while they're at it. A posse<br>
is assembled and all lions in the area are hunted down and killed. The<br>
revenge-driven group has made life a bit safer for themselves, and probably<br>
for later generations too. <br>
<p>
Revenge might have played a major part in man's ascension to the no.1 <br>
spot in the food chain. Even today revenge might be the real drive behind<br>
justice systems and many a personal crusade against crime. "I want justice" <br>
really means "I want revenge". I'd be very careful with removing this emotion <br>
from the human meme/gene complex.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; An argument for a judicial system based on revenge is an argument for </i><br>
<i>&gt; barbarism. </i><br>
<p>
The need for retribution does not make someone a barbarian, just like feeling<br>
joy or anger or any other emotion doesn't make you a barbarian. A good justice<br>
system takes all three elements into account (protect society from the criminal,<br>
discourage potential criminals and satisfy the victim's/society's need for revenge).<br>
It isn't up to the justice system to be "holier than Jesus" so to speak, but to put<br>
the punishment in proportion to the crime, and be consequent at it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (The whole point of law is to enable people</i><br>
<i>&gt; to coexist peacably without infringing each other's rights. Revenge</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't damp down imbalances in the observation of rights; it just</i><br>
<i>&gt; tips the balance the other way.)</i><br>
<p>
The action(s) coming from the need for revenge might restore the balance<br>
of justice, if done in a controlled and professional way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thirdly, there's prevention. Locking people who break laws up for long</i><br>
<i>&gt; periods of time may or may not be appropriate, but in some cases it may</i><br>
<i>&gt; be the most appropriate way to prevent them re-offending. It has the big</i><br>
<i>&gt; advantage (over captial punishment) that if you discover after you've</i><br>
<i>&gt; locked someone up that they were innocent, you can let them out and try</i><br>
<i>&gt; to provide some kind of compensation. </i><br>
<p>
As a kind of compromise you could consider freezing executed criminals as<br>
a standard practice. Once (if?) perfected suspended animation is possible<br>
it could be used as an alternative for incarceration too. Anyway, killing or<br>
otherwise removing criminals *works* when done properly (no parole BS)<br>
because you elliminate these misfits from society. Not only are they <br>
personally removed, but also their genes from the genepool.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But imprisonment is still an</i><br>
<i>&gt; after-the-fact approach to prevention. The best approach to crime and</i><br>
<i>&gt; punishment would be one that aims to prevent crimes being comitted in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the first place by diverting or defusing criminal impulses (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; minimising the number of spurious or victimless crimes on the statutes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; of course). And I think the best way to do this is probably some sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; polycentric, open, surveillance society -- Neighbourhood Watch with CCTV</i><br>
<i>&gt; writ large, so that everyone participates in crime prevention (meaning</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are no authoritarian figures in a privileged position to police</i><br>
<i>&gt; society) and everyone knows that it's very difficult to commit a crime</i><br>
<i>&gt; and get away undetected.</i><br>
<p>
Full agreement here! Cameras and microphones all over as far as I'm<br>
concerned (all public spaces like streets, parks, malls, tunnels etc.),<br>
all with interlocking fields of view. Some highly visible, some hidden.<br>
Also cops should have small personal cameras &amp; listening devices<br>
on their clothing and on their gun (to be auto- activated whenever the <br>
gun is drawn). Personal cams etc. should be highly recommended to<br>
private citizens too. The images are automatically send to various<br>
central databanks with either completely free or highly monitored<br>
access, and local copies (near the cam/audio device itself) are kept<br>
too (and can be downloaded into the general databanks at designated<br>
points (or via your PC or whatever). Everything is auto-dated for later<br>
reference. Of course all certified recordings have full power of evidence<br>
in a court of law.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; But first, of course, we need to figure out what constitutes a crime, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; what constitutes a welfare program for police officers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Any opinions ...?</i><br>
<p>
Some "certain" crimes:<br>
<p>
-murder<br>
-manslaugter<br>
-theft<br>
-physical harm<br>
-psychological terrorizing<br>
-slander<br>
-rape<br>
-damage to property<br>
-stalking<br>
<p>
"Non-crimes"<br>
<p>
-using recreational (or other) drugs<br>
-gambling<br>
-prostitution<br>
-abortion<br>
-euthanasia (when voluntary)<br>
-pornography<br>
-killing in self-defense (including duelling)<br>
-eating fatty foods<br>
-blasphemy ;-)<br>
<p>
Basically, anything goes as long as it doesn't harm others without their<br>
consent.<br>
