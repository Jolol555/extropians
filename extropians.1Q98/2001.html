Income from what, taxation?  Unless you plan to engage in plunder<br>
nation building (indeed almost all forms of political action) are<br>
huge resource drains.  If you want income learn a useful skill<br>
and/or start a business, save, and invest.  Say FAR away from<br>
things political (unless you need to engage in rent seeking to<br>
pursue a money making opportunity).<br>

Founding a new nation would be a horrible direction for <br>
transhumanism and an awful drill for migration into space.  I<br>
want nothing to do with nations in space and/or as a posthuman.<br>
<p>
Nations suck, please don't start another one!<br>
<p>
<p>
Nonetheless I find these discussions somewhat interesting, not<br>
because I thinking founding an extropian state (sounds like an<br>
oxymoron) is a good idea, but because thinking about locations<br>
and strategies that would maximize my freedom in this reality<br>
is fun and perhaps will be useful someday.<br>
<p>
In this spirit I find James Rogers' suggestion of the southeast<br>
Alaskan islands interesting.  One other nice thing about this<br>
location is that it seems to be seismically inactive relative to<br>
neighboring regions.  See<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.ei.gov.bc.ca/geosmin/mapinv/surfical/quake/eq3.htm">http://www.ei.gov.bc.ca/geosmin/mapinv/surfical/quake/eq3.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
I'd guess that the southern islands of Chile may be another<br>
good location to investigate: relatively nice climate, relatively<br>
benign government.  They aren't near a major tech center, but <br>
they are far from the U.S., which could be useful.  Apparently<br>
it is possible for foreigners to buy large amounts of land.  I<br>
read recently that one of the founders of Espirit (the clothing<br>
company) raised the ire of some Chilean businesspeople for <br>
buying a huge amount of land -- not because he is a foreigner,<br>
but because he plans to give the land to the government for<br>
a national park, thus closing it to development.<br>
