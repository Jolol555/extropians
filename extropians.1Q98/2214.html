My wife can't stand "Forest Gump", for much of the same reasons you list.<br>
In fact, she gets very upset whenever someone mentions it.  She really<br>
hates the idea that this idiotic guy has everything come out so well<br>
without doing anything to control his own life.<br>
<p>
In Contact, the ending was changed from the earlier book by Carl Sagan.<br>
In the book, the reality of the experience was questioned only for a<br>
short while.  The fact that the erased recordings showed a long elapsed<br>
time came out pretty quickly, and was made public.  Also, the aliens had<br>
hinted about some numeric patterns buried in PI, and eventually these<br>
were confirmed, further giving credibility to the experience.  This<br>
totally changed the thrust of the ending.<br>
<p>
Actually, I didn't think the movie version made a very clear point.<br>
It was not trying to equate science and religion.  No one ever said that<br>
personal and mystical experiences could serve as a basis for science.<br>
<p>
Rather, it seemed to be a more personal comeuppance for the Jodie Foster<br>
character, who had scoffed at the unreproducible nature of religious<br>
revelation, only to be given an unreproducible experience herself.<br>
However she was consistent in that she recognized that there was no<br>
evidence of the reality of what she had encountered, hence she eventually<br>
came to view it in purely personal terms.<br>
<p>
It would seem that eventually there would have to be some additional<br>
contact with the aliens, since not much happened on the first contact.<br>
Probably they want to break it to earth gradually and give people time<br>
to adapt.  But eventually they would want to do more.  Hopefully at that<br>
time Foster's character will feel some personal vindication.  Maybe a<br>
"Contact 2" is in the works.<br>
