<p>
The plants we use for our farm ecosystems have been studied in<br>
the field for thousands of years with biodiversity gone, in<br>
the Nile, Tigris-Euphrates, Indus, Ganges, and Hwang Ho river<br>
valleys, and they do great.  Laboratory studies of these same<br>
organisms has revealed the reason for this; these plants<br>
grow fine, indefinitely, in systems in which they are the only <br>
things alive, as long as they are provided with an impressively<br>
short list of nutrients.<br>
<p>
Can you name even one organism that needs biodiversity to survive?<br>
