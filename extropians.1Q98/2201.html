[  I wish to stress that this message's sole intent is<br>
to make people reflect about the way certain aspects of<br>
the Extropy Institute are operated.  Its intent is not<br>
to flame.  After writing it I realized that it might invoke<br>
strong reactions from some people.  Its intent is to<br>
represent constructive criticism.  ]<br>
<p>
I'm guessing that the the Skeptic's Dictionary won't hold<br>
the Extropy Institute ("ExI") in too favorable a light.<br>
Whether that treatment will be deserved is another matter<br>
altogether.  I admit I do not completely agree with (or maybe<br>
I just do not understand) some of the thinking I see at ExI.<br>
Extropy is a nice synonym for self-improvement with the added<br>
kicker of transhumanism as an ultimate objective, but I don't<br>
see what all the fuss is over the concept?  Esfandiary should<br>
probably be credited with whole concept.  What substance is<br>
the act of coining a term for a concept that someone else<br>
created?<br>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, coining terms is great idea since it can<br>
help to improve commmunication.  Take a concept that would<br>
otherwise take a sentence or two to trigger the reader's<br>
mind and encapsulate it in a word.  But I see a lot of people<br>
patting themselves on the back for simply coining a term.<br>
<p>
Extropian art?  I've just do not get it.  What is the<br>
significance of art by people who actively strive for<br>
transhumanism.  I am not saying it has no significance.  But<br>
how significant is it in the grand scheme of things? Granted,<br>
it may have some peripheral value.  But does such a concept<br>
warrant the allocation of resources it has been afforded?<br>
Aren't there other activities these funds and efforts could<br>
be directed towards to further the ideas of extropy?  Exempli<br>
gratia, subsidize publication efforts, produce more information<br>
on the Extropy site, etc.  I enjoyed my visit to the art site<br>
but could help but wonder what other ways the time and effort<br>
expended to create and maintain that site could have been more<br>
effectively utilized.<br>
<p>
Extropa-groups (or whatever the living communities are called).<br>
My wife and my children as a unit, we strive for self-improvement.<br>
We actively seek to prepare ourselves for the future.  But we<br>
do not feel the need to use embody our "community" with a term<br>
to illustrate this.  What point does calling a group "extropa-<br>
something" serve?  More on this below.<br>
<p>
Sex and fashion.  I visited the transhuman.org site (which I<br>
must profess looked more like an excuse to lock up a site name<br>
than a substantive information resource).  These two subjects<br>
were major subject areas.  I just do not see the relevance of<br>
even addressing sex or fashion in the same context with<br>
discussions about nanotechnology, AI, uploading, Singularities,<br>
etc.  Like art, maybe these subjects have some peripheral value,<br>
but elevating their status makes me wonder whether its a vision<br>
of the future thats trying to be emphasized or just an iteration<br>
of alternative subculture (such as goth, cyberpunk, etc.)<br>
<p>
New ways of thinking are very vulnerable to being viewed as<br>
cultish nonsense.  Nonsense in the vein that people seize ideas<br>
that resemble salvation from present circumstances. Designated<br>
groups, name changing, questionable commitment to the real issues,<br>
it sounds like a cult more than an intellectual critique of the<br>
future (and more importantly how we can get there while also<br>
performing the trick of survival).  Drexler himself said that<br>
if you do not want to imperil funding sources for the various<br>
technical people who will be needed to make the breakthroughs<br>
that would harbor the future we speculate about here then:<br>
<p>
     "please keep the level of cultishness and bullshit down"<br>
