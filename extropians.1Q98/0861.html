It seems this explanation fits the facts, though I wonder if any other<br>
does too and does a better job.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What to do about it (beside rewiring our cognitive structure at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;earliest opportunity)?</i><br>
<p>
Though this seems possible, I think a lot of the tools are<br>
already at hand.  Most people are smart enought to get<br>
past the prejudices.  It's just a matter of getting through<br>
to them.  Thus, we don't need radical surgery, uploading,<br>
genetic engineering, etc. to overcome this.  Recall, last<br>
century many people where against anesthesia. It didn't<br>
take much more than a little convincing to change their<br>
minds.<br>
<p>
You might claim this was because the pro-anesthesia<br>
camp could tap into the anti-suffering attitude prevalent<br>
in many cultures.  If this is so, it can be argued that their<br>
is a pro-technology attitude, despite the neoLuddite and<br>
technophobic propoganda, in our cultures.  We can tap<br>
into that in the same way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One possibility is to create counter-images for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the disaster scenarios, just as vivid and showing clearly why they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;not valid. For example, the image of a dictator cloning an army can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;counter-imaged by pointing out that the dictator will have to wait</i><br>
<i>&gt;around 18 years for the babies to grow up - and few dictators want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;have an army in two decades, when they usually need it today. In</i><br>
<i>&gt;short, we should work to defuse the irrational disaster scenarios by</i><br>
<i>&gt;showing how they can be avoided or why they are so silly. Of course we</i><br>
<i>&gt;need good arguments for our positions too, but when it comes to</i><br>
<i>&gt;dealing with downright propaganda techniques like this are handy.</i><br>
<p>
I have advocated in earlier posts and tried to create such<br>
counter-images, but in a lot of cases, I've tried to get people<br>
to drop the whole horror story mindset.  This seems to work<br>
amongst the more intellectual, who just as often have the<br>
same prejudices as the nonintellectuals.  It's just that they<br>
also can be helped to question them.<br>
<p>
But this is not to say counter-images are useless.  I tend to<br>
agree with Rand about art being a powerful tool.  Those<br>
among us who are writers or film makers can use this to<br>
project the moral and social problems of cloning in a more<br>
rational light.<br>
