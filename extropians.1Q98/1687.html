Uh, I don't think so. From my estimations, a 50 k$ hardware investment now<br>
will yield in a desktop device capable of traditional-MD-probing well into<br>
the us domain (roughly a 1000x increase since 1987/88). Sans any novel<br>
algorithms whatsoever (btw, such simple things as DMPTA have turned O(n*n)<br>
into O(n) while maintaining accurate long-range Coulomb interactions).<br>
Today, a hypothetical large ASIC box should reduce that amount noticeably,<br>
and thus make ms domains accessible. Several proteins fold that quick. <br>
<p>
This brute-force approach may be actually unnecessary. If we can guarantee<br>
not to miss a critical carrefour in the folding process (which is not too<br>
easy), shortcutting the brownian randomwalk in the configuration space by<br>
a clever minimization should reduce the effort vastly. Precise endgame<br>
potential can be extracted from empirical data.<br>

<p>
The idea of autoassembly is based on complementary-surface alignment and<br>
noncovalent bonding of subblocks resulting in your desired space-filling. <br>
Noncovalent attachements require excellent precision, even more so<br>
covalent bonds (xref disulfide bond engineering difficulties in protein<br>
stabilization). <br>
