<i>&gt; |&gt; An Interim Report on the Death of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, et al.</i><br>

<i>&gt; |&gt; We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of the two</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; dozen brave and concerned citizens, officials, and military</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; personnel who have risked disclosure and the abrupt end of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; their careers--if not their lives--by assisting us with timely</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; and accurate information included in this report.  For the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; information on the circumstances surrounding the death of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Ron Brown, we are especially indebted to I-3, our third major</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; informant within U.S. military ranks in the past year.  "Eye</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Three," as he is nicknamed, is a highly-placed military</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; source.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Cilipi Airport, Dubrovnik, Croatia, 2:10 P.M.,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; April 3, 1996:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Captain Amir Schic lands a twin-engine corporate jet</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; carrying the Croatian Prime Minister and the American</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Ambassador.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; It is one of five planes to land routinely on Runway 12 in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; hour preceding the scheduled 3:00 arrival of IFOR-2 1, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Boeing T-43A carrying Ron Brown and his upbeat entourage</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; of American industrial deal-makers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Cilipi Airport, 2:15 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Businessmen begin to straggle into the lobby, a few carrying</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; umbrellas to ward off the very light to moderate rain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; They're early because they're anxious to greet the 35</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Americans who at this moment are taking off from Tuzla,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Bosnia, 130 miles to the northeast. Outside, a perfect</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; breeze blows at 14 mph from east to west, perfect because</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; at 120' from north, it is only one degree off from being an</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; exact headwind for the landing pattern of IFOR-21.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Contrary to some U.S. news reports, it is not a dark and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; stormy night.  It is the middle of the afternoon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The Radio Shack of Cilipi Airport, about 2:30 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Maintenance Chief Niko Jerkuic, 46, nervously fiddles with</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; the dials on his NDR (Nondirectional Radio) beacon, the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; instrument he has that can guide approaching planes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; In a couple of hours, he will be a rich man, the two American</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; operatives told him, if he can quietly send IFOR-21 into Sveti</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Ivan (St. John's Hill), one of the highest mountains in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; area at 2400 feet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Jerkuic will simply shut his beacon down-at the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; moment that a decoy beacon is turned on by an American</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; operative sitting near the base of Sveti Ivan.  This is an old</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; trick dating back to pirate days.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; He inspects his terrain map again and again.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; If he miscalculates ... well, the Americans did not look like</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; men who would forgive someone who botches a serious</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; assignment like this one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; All Jerkuic knows is that there is someone on the plane who</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; is very dangerous to the American President, and it is his</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; job to make sure the plane never lands.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; With a shaky hand, he picks up a scrambled walkie-talkie</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; and rechecks with the American agent who is sitting in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; jeep at Sveti Ivan with another NDR in a suitcase beside him.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Jerkuic glances out at some broken clouds scudding by 400</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; feet above.  They will have no effect.  He will have to depend</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; on the main cloud cover at 2,000 feet.  Sveti Ivan rises</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; almost 400 feet into this overcast.  Jerkuic calculates that</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; the new signal will alter the plane's course by a full ten</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; degrees and send it far off course to the north into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; mountain.  His timing will have to be perfect.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Money or no money, he begins to wonder if he's doing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; right thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Cilipi Airport, 2:48 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Captain Schic climbs to the control tower to give IFOR-21 a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; friendly radio greeting and reassurance that all is well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; He describes the Cilipi weather: Visibility eight kilometers (5</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; miles), winds still at 14 mph, all flights arriving non-normally.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Flying at about 10,000 feet and 40+ miles away, Co-captains</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Ashley J. Davis, 35, and Tim Shafer, 33, thank Schic for his</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; words of welcome.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; These conditions are later described by Newsweek and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; others as "the worst storm in ten years" with "visibility just</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 100 yards." (Their portrayal of the weather is flatly denied by</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Aviation Week and Space Technology.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; In the clouds over the Adriatic Sea. 2:50 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; IFOR-21 reports in to, Cilipi routinely.  It is the last time their</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; voice is heard.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Split, Croatia, 2:52 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The main regional radar station loses IFOR-21 from its</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; screen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Cilipi Airport, 2:52 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Jerkuic stops monitoring the control tower to detect any</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; other planes in the landing pattern.  There are none, so he</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; calls the American at Sveti Ivan again.  They countdown: 5,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 4, 3, 2, 1. Simultaneously, Jerkuic shuts down and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; American powers up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Kolocep Island, 2:54 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; IFOR-21 is on course as it passes over Cilipi's first beacon,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 11.9 miles from the airport.  It then locks onto the second</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; and final beam that is being transmitted from Sveti Ivan.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; This changes the plane's actual direction from 119' to 109',</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; heading straight into Sveti Ivan.  But the Cilipi control tower</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; doesn't know the plane is now off course.  It has no radar.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Aboard an AWACS plane, 2:56 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The U.S. Air Force plane keeping track of air traffic in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Bosnian conflict area loses track of IFOR-21 just after it</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; passes over Dubrovnik. (Being the military version of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Boeing 737-200, IFOR-21 is not easily lost.) Because it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; less than a mile off course at this point, no one on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; AWACS notes any problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Srebreno, Croatia, 2:57 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Villagers hear a plane roaring past unusually low and close.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Plat, Croatia, 2:57 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Villagers Ana and Miho Duplica rush outside and see</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; IFOR-21 looming "like a ghost out of the clouds."</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Velji Do, Croatia, 2:58 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Everyone in this tiny collection of stone huts at the base of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Sveti Ivan hears a plane go directly overhead in the clouds,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; then rev its engines mightily for one instant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Aboard the plane, the klaxon of its ground-proximity warning</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; device suddenly blares, jolting Captain Davis.  He</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; immediately jerks the plane upward and to the left.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The two to three seconds of warning are far too little.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; plane's left wingtip touches ground, spinning it directly into</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; the rocky hillside, making an earth-shaking explosion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; There is the crackling hiss of a huge fireball as the plane</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; and its large load of gas bum.  Then a dead silence in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; mist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The tail section remains quite intact, but the rest of IFOR-21</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; is all over the hill, making later identification of many of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; passengers impossible.  The nose of the fuselage is just a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; blackish smudge in the ground.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; All 35 people are dead except for stewardess Shelly Kelly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; who, riding in the tail, sustains only minor cuts and bruises.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Cilipi, 3:18 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; U.S. authorities are notified that IFOR-21 is down, location</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; completely unknown.  However, they are to suffer II @ hours</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; of confusion before arriving at the scene-</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Republic of South Africa, approximately 4:00 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; News reports say an attempt has been made on the life of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Ron Brown's law partner, Tommy Boggs, by unknown</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; assailants in a staged car accident in Capetown.  Later,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Boggs refuses to discuss it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Cilipi, later that afternoon:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Niko Jerkuic goes home to collect his reward, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; reward is not waiting for him.  It comes three days later: a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; bullet through the chest, administered just shortly before he</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; is scheduled to be grilled by the U.S. Air Force accident</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; investigation team.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The hit squad wraps his hand around the gun and departs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The Americans do not want a live witness who could spill</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; the beans later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Like many of the Whitewater dead, Jerkuic is immediately</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; labeled a suicide, even though there's no evidence-and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; chest wound is a rather rare cause especially with a large</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; caliber pistol (unusual in Europe).</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The quick official reason given for bachelor Jerkuic's death</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; is despondence over romantic troubles with his girlfriend.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; At this point, however, we have not been able to find any</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; verification for this.  Instead, what we have found is</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; neighbors and friends who all agree that Jerkuic was not</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; depressed.  Like many of his friends who had survived the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; years of the Bosnian war, he was excited that life was finally</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; getting better.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Crash site, 7:20 P.M.:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Four hours and 20 minutes after the crash, the first Croatian</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Special Forces search party arrives on the scene and finds</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; only Ms. Kelly surviving.  They call for a helicopter to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; evacuate her to the hospital. when it arrives, she is able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; get aboard without assistance from the medics.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; But Kelly never completes the short hop.  She dies enroute.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; According to multiple reports given to journalist/editor Joe L.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Jordan, an autopsy later reveals a neat three-inch incision</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; over her main femoral artery. It also shows that the incision</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; came at least three hours after all her other cuts and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; bruises.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; This datum, of course, creates in one's mind a horrifying</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; scene in the back of the chopper, as one Special Forces</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; operative holds down the struggling woman and muffles her</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; screams while another slices her leg.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Further necropsies will probably not happen.  At this writing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Clinton has ordered the cremation of all victims.  It's hard to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; perform autopsies on ashes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; All this cries, of course, for an explanation of why anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; would be so eager to kill Ron Brown that they would take 34</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; innocent Americans along with him.  I will address this issue</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; in a moment.  But First let me describe the current state of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; thinking on the cause of the crash.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Confusion or Coverup?</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Ever since the crash, most reporters and officials have</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; refused to even consider the possibility of foul play.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Some of them have merely followed orders.  But most of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; them have instinctively fled from the highly disturbing</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; possibility that Ron Brown was assassinated by people</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; close to his own President.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; So confronted with the total impossibility of two</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; experienced pilots following an NDR beam to a crash site</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 1.6 miles off course, they all shrug their shoulders in</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; bewilderment.  None of their theories have come even close</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; to explaining how a beacon that is accurate to within two</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; feet at the landing point could lead the plane so far astray.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; But they have tried:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - The Air Force's official explanation is that the pilots set the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; compass on the IFOR-21 10' off course.  That is impossible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Pilots routinely set their compasses right before takeoff.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; they set the compass off 10', they would not have been on</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; course when they passed the first beacon, 11.8 miles from</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; the airport.  Instead they would have been miles and miles</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; off course at this point.  To make this explanation even more</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; absurd, the plane was flying on the NDR signal, not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; compass.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - One desperate explanation was a nasty crosswind that</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; "blew" the plane sideways.  Not credible: This would require</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; a wind 90' off from the actual wind.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - Most of the press and officialdom have blamed poor</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; visibility to some extent.  To do this, they have to take the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; ferocity of the rainstorm later that afternoon and evening</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; and move it back in time to the crash hour.  But records</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; show the weather from 2:54 P.M. to 2:58 P.M. was well</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; within the normal limits for landing.  And NDR beacons never</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; get blown off course.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; In any case, pilots more than a few miles from an airport</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; normally rely on a beam rather than visual sighting anyway.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - Pilot fatigue and strain?  Not likely on a 45minute flight.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - Equipment malfunction on a rickety old plane?  IFOR-21</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; was the number two plane in the White House fleet: in</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; essence, Air Force Two.  It had carried Hillary and Chelsea</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Clinton and Defense Secretary William Perry just the week</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; before.  Everything about the flight was checked out and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; rehearsed a week in advance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - Lightning or other troubles causing the pilots to lose track</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; of the beam?  No, they were both drilled in the standard</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; procedure for Cilipi: If you lose the beam or miss the airport,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; you immediately veer TO THE RIGHT AND UP to make sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; you avoid Sveti Ivan.  Indisputably, the pilots thought they</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; were following the beacon, or they would have executed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; standard right turn within seconds.  Plus, their landing gear</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; was locked down, showing that they expected to land at any</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; moment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; In sum, none of the "official" explanations to date have held</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; any water.  And all of them ignore the glaring fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; IFOR-21 did not simply stray off the path at the last moment;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; by all accounts, it went straight as an arrow to its doom the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; moment it left the Kolocep Island beacon and picked up the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Cilipi beacon.  The problem had to be the Cilipi beacon,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; which was shut down at the airport while a substitute</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; transmitter at Sveti Ivan was turned on.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; And Even Worse...</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Could the problem have been that technician Niko Jerkuic</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; had let his equipment become rundown?  No, thousands of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; landings had taken place while his equipment was running,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; some just minutes before the crash.  To transmit an NDR</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; beacon that's ten degrees off, it takes more than an</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; accident.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Obviously, this explanation could do double duty by aiding</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; the suicide theory.  In this scenario, Jerkuic simply felt so</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; bad about his shoddy work that he shot himself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Unfortunately for the theory, you can't just accidentally</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; bump a knob and make the whole apparatus line planes up</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; with Sveti Ivan.  It takes a sustained effort by a qualified</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; engineer.  Plus, other planes had landed just before IFOR-21.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; So Jerkuic had to shut off his beacon at the last minute.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The question arises: Could not the whole issue be resolved</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; by a quick review of the tapes at the control tower?  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; probably could-if the tapes had not suddenly disappeared.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; And couldn't the air traffic controller shed some light on</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; things?  Certainly.  But now he, too, has "committed suicide</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; which, by the way, is a rare event for such a cause in</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Croatian culture.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; I repeat: No official anywhere is facing these facts.  As a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; result, their "explanations" are laced with words like</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; mysterious and unknown and inexplicably.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The unanimous opinion of our informants: This information,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; if widely known, would eliminate any chance of Clinton's</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; re-election.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The First Time in History: Air Force Kills Investigation</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The chief investigator for Pratt &amp; Whitney happened to be at</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; the Paris Air Show on April 3.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Because Pratt &amp; Whitney always sends an investigator</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; when a plane powered by their engines has a mishap, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; man called his boss in America, and said, in effect, "We've</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; just had a crash in Croatia.  I think I'd better get down there."</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The response was, "Go pack."</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; But as the investigator was packing at his hotel, the boss</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; called back.  "Don't go," he said to the astonished employee.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; "There's not going to be a safety investigation."</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Sure enough, the Air Force had, for the first time in its</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; history, canceled the safety investigation of a crash on</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; friendly soil.  There would only be a quick token legal</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; investigation designed to enable a committee to blame the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; pilots or some remote general and go home.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; At this time it's an open question whether the black boxes</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; will play a role.  Within hours of the crash, the Croatian</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Ministry of Transport announced that they had the black</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; boxes.  One and a half days after the crash, Croatian TV</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; (plus Russian and French TV) announced that the FDR (flight</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; data recorder) and the CVR (cockpit voice recorder) were</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; safely in the hands of U.S. Marines.  They said that soon "the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; cause of the crash will be assessed to find out what</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; happened."</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The U.S. European command in Stuttgart, Germany, also</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; stated that a black box was aboard.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Later, the Pentagon brass stoutly disputed all this, stating</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; that there were no black boxes aboard.  They claimed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; actual recovered boxes were designed to hold soda pop and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; toilet paper. (The Croats, who feel they can tell a reel of tape</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; from a roll of toilet paper, are keeping mum.) Also, black</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; boxes are usually painted bright orange, and they can't be</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; opened with a thumb-or hardly at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; It is difficult to imagine that America's #2 VIP plane had no</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; black box.  And a veteran Air Force mechanic who claims to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; have worked on just about every T-43A in the USAF tells us</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; he never saw one without a black box.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Why would anyone want to Murder Ron Brown?</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; By all accounts, Ron Brown was a charming fellow who</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; worked very hard and very effectively to promote U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; business.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Why, then, would anyone want to kill him?  And who would</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; have the resources to do it by bringing down a large White</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; House airplane?</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The answer, in brief, is that Ron Brown was going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; prison-no ifs, ands, or buts about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Also, Bill Clinton's presidency was surely going down with</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; him.  And that the President would not allow.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; To anyone who has followed the story closely, this</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; conclusion is obvious.  Brown was up to his neck in</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; numerous major scandals: Whitewater, the Denver airport</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; mess, Mena, the Keating Five, Lillian Madsen and her Haitian</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; prostitutes, etc., etc.  Small wonder that 22 congressmen</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; wrote Clinton in February of 1995, demanding that he fire</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Brown.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; At the time of his murder, Brown was under investigation by:</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - a special prosecutor in the Justice Dept.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - the FDIC</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - the Congressional Reform and Oversight Committee</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - the FBI</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - the Energy Dept.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - the Senate Judiciary Committee</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; - and even his own Commerce Dept.  Inspector General.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; But in case you missed the piecemeal accounts in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; papers, here is an extremely condensed summary of II of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Brown's woes (which were shortly going to become</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Clinton's woes, as I'll show below):</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 1. How did North Vietnam recently get us to drop our trade</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; embargo against them so suddenly?  Easy.  As a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Vietnamese businessman and official later revealed to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; press, the Communist government paid Brown $700,000 to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; do it.  The money went into a Singapore bank account, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; embargo fell, and Clinton squashed a feeble FBI attempt to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; investigate.  He and Brown also neutralized a federal grand</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; jury probe later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 2. Brown sold plane seats on other trade trips besides the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; one to Bosnia/Croatia.  Companies making big contributions</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; to the Democratic Party or the Clinton Victory Fund could</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; buy access and get tax breaks or regulatory favors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 3. The 1/23/95 U.S. News &amp; World Report broke the news</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; that Brown had bought a $360,000 townhouse for his</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; girlfriend, Lillian Madsen, a prominent political player and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; whorehouse madam from Haiti.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 4. Brown used to receive $12,500 a month as the P.R. flack</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; for Baby Doc Duvalier, the much-loathed dictator of Haiti.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Brown also managed Baby Doc's $50 million investment</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; fund, most or all of which is now in Vietnam firms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 5. Brown was a key board member of Chemfix, a Louisiana</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; "waste management" corporation that landed a $2 1 0</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; million contract with New York City in 1990 with Brown's</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; help despite the fact that Chemfix had two contracts with</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; other municipalities canceled because of the company's</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; inability to perform.  Brown got company stock at 24% of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; market value (making him millions) and New York mayor</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; David Dinkins got to host the Democratic Convention.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; typical Ron Brown win-win deal.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 6. Brown founded Capital/Pebsco, which-fresh out of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; box-got a contract with D.C. mayor Marion Barry to handle</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; the city's pension funds.  Not a bad start for a new company</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; with no investing experience.  Brown earned huge fees.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 7. In a deal that left CIA people livid, Brown okayed the sale</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; of a new U.S. gas turbine engine to China for use in its</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; cruise missiles.  McDonnell Douglas developed the turbine</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; as a military engine, but by arbitrarily reclassifying it as</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; "civilian," Brown enabled China to build a fleet of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; missiles-which they can point at America (whom else?),</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; powered by our own engines.  As part of the lucrative deal,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; McDonnell Douglas agreed to set up an airplane</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; manufacturing plant using cheap slave labor in China.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 8. Brown irked Congress and most of Europe by acting as</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; point man for Clinton to bring Iranian Muslims and their</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; weaponry into the Bosnia war.  That broke the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; U.S.-endorsed arms embargo. The money for the arms was</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; most likely from Commerce and Agriculture, slush fund</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; money channeled to U.S. manufacturers, thence to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; U.S.friendly nations and firms overseas, thence to Iran.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; arms included: helicopter gunships stinger missiles</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; *land mines</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; *anti-aircraft guns</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; *anti-tank weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; *grenade launchers</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; ... and other quality weaponry, most of which will remain on</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; the European scene for decades to come, keeping the area</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; destabilized.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; As one leading munitions dealer put it: "Iran/Contra was</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; slingshots and cap guns compared to the quantities and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; size of arms given the Croatian Serbs."</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; That is why the Croatians were enthusiastically hosting</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Brown's planeload of executives.  They felt gratitude for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; free arms as well as a desire to do deals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 9. Brown was the partner of a Democratic fundraiser named</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Nolanda Hill, who paid him $500,000 for his 50% interest in</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; First International, Inc., a company that never made any</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; profits.  Most glaringly, Brown never invested a cent in First</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Int'l.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; First Int'l owned Corridor Broadcasting, which had defaulted</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; on massive government loans of $40 million.  The loans</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; were passed to the FDIC, which was unsuccessful in</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; collecting anything from Hill, even though at that time the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; firm was making large contributions to the Democratic</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Party and paying hundreds of thousands to Brown through</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; shell corporations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; These payments to Brown (three checks for $45,000 each)</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; were the core of evidence gathered by Rep. William F.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Clinger, Jr., that forced Reno to hire Daniel Pearson as</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; special investigator of Brown's crimes.  They were</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; cashier's checks, all cut on the same day in 1993 with</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; sequential numbers even though the money supposedly</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; came from three contributors acting independently.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Brown never disclosed or paid any taxes on these amounts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 10. By personally delivering a warning letter signed by</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Clinton, Brown was able to force a bargain deal with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Saudis for $6 billion in American military aircraft and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; hardware.  The quid pro quo: To get the planes, the Saudis</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; also had to accept a fat $4 billion phone contract with AT&amp;T.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Also part of the deal: AT&amp;T had a side agreement with</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Brown's First International (see above).  And the Democratic</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; National Committee and the Clinton campaign fund were</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; beneficiaries.  This is how big business is done in Clinton's</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; America.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; 11. The last nail in Brown's coffin was pounded in four days</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; before the crash.  FBI and IRS agents subpoenaed as many</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; as 20 witnesses for a serious new grand jury probe of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Brown in Washington.  It seems that an Oklahoma gas</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; company called Dynamic Energy Resources gave Brown's</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; son Michael $500,000 in stock, a $160,000 cash payment,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; and exclusive country club memberships.  Fortner Dynamic</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; president Stewart Price told a Tulsa grand jury that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; money was to be routed to Ron Brown, who was expected</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; to "fix" a big lawsuit for Dynamic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; There is little chance you heard about this deathknell, grand</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; jury case.  It was reported on radio station KTOK in</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Oklahoma on March 28 and on the front page of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Washington Times March 29.  But then a lock was put on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; story; the AP and New York Times wire services blocked</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; any further release of the information. (Welcome to the New</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; World Order)</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Final proof: the 2/8/96 Washington Post reported that Brown</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; had retained top legal gun Reid Weingarten, a former high</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; official in the Justice Department, as his criminal attorney.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; You don't pay his prices ($750 an hour) unless you know a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; criminal indictment is coming and you're probably going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; jail.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Janet Reno appointed Daniel Pearson as Brown's special</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; prosecutor.  When she gave him blanket permission to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; investigate anything, Brown angrily demanded that Clinton</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; force her to withdraw Pearson.  But Reno couldn't do that;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; she had been backed into a comer by Rep. Clinger, who is</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; chairman of the House Govemment Refonn and Oversight</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Conimittee.  Clinger had copies of Brown's First International</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; checks, among other incriminating documents.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; When Clinton said he couldn't comply, Brown went ballistic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; His fatal mistake-according to Brown confidants who</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; requested anonymity-was telling Clinton that he wasn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; going to take the rap.  He wasn't going to let his wife and son</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; take the rap, either. (Both had received hundreds of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; thousands of dollars in under-the-table payments</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; themselves.) He was going to finger Bill and Hillary instead.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; That would have sunk the reelection campaign on the spot.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Dead Man Walking</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; &gt;From that point on, Brown was dead.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; Like Vincent Foster before him, he knew too much.  More</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; than any man in Washington, he knew where all the money</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; went for the payoffs, bribes, scams, money laundering,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; cover-ups, participation fees, hush money, and side</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; deals-all the way from one-man operations to vast</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; multinational trade treaty fixes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; The phony suicide fakeout used on Foster could not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; repeated, of course.  But an airplane "whack," in the jargon</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; of the intelligence community, is always viewed as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; accident.  So agents were sent--not directly by Clinton, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; through a White House staffer--to a standing network of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; high-level killers, sometimes called the "Octopus." (See</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; item on Danny Casolaro in Part II).</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; If the frequently-stormy weather at Cilipi had not</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; co-operated, there would always be another trip</i><br>
<i>&gt; |&gt; somewhere, somehow-and soon.</i><br>
