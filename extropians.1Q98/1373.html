<i>&gt; A good point. Unfortunately the cannabinoids as they stand today seem</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be rather crude tools for enhancing creativity. The studies above</i><br>
<i>&gt; are not necessarily the last word, but they suggest that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannabinoid induced creative experience may just a subjective</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience of creativity, not something that actually produces more</i><br>
<i>&gt; creative results (I admit that measuring creativity is at best hard</i><br>
<i>&gt; and in itself somewhat subjective). We cannot trust our subjective</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiences to reflect the objective world, we need to check them</i><br>
<i>&gt; carefully.</i><br>
<p>
It  doesn't matter to me if some experiences seem only an illusion. The<br>
resulting thoughts and actions are all I can measure. It seems that if I limit<br>
my use of hemp to sessions where I'm exorcising my creative best, the results<br>
are very productive and insightful. Often, I find myself almost too detail<br>
oriented and as an art lover, its the details where I think some of the most<br>
ingenious ingredients are found. ...so I tolerate the obsessive nature of the<br>
experience.<br>
<p>
On a different tangent, I'd be willing to try a synthetic drug if I thought<br>
that I could get similar results minus the negative effects of hemp. (oh yes,<br>
there are undesirable side effects, the worst being dehydration)<br>
<p>
As a neural scientist, what does hemp do that causes dehydration? Ever heard of<br>
cotton mouth?? Are there herbal supplements that I can eat which would help<br>
combat that effect??<br>
