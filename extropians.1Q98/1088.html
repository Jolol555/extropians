I just had a thought with regards to your CO2 example.<br>
<p>
What if companies were required to clean up their waste (in this case CO2)<br>
by purchasing/creating forested land that can convert their equivalent CO2<br>
output into clean air?  Granted it would be more expensive than just<br>
polluting, but it would be an interesting way to handle industrial<br>
pollutants.  This is already done to some extent in the timber industry<br>
through reforestation.  A system like this could be applied to a great many<br>
industries and would go a long way towards protecting "public goods" by<br>
enforcing a zero-sum usage policy.<br>
<p>
I already see some obvious flaws in this, but it could be a step in the<br>
right direction in some industries.  Instead of purchasing the "right" to<br>
pollute from the government, many people would be better off if industry<br>
returned public goods in the condition they obtained them in.<br>
