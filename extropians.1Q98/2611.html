Michael Lorrey wrote 3/6/98: &lt;The Declaration of Independence states that<br>
'men are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among<br>
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.  Whether you regard<br>
your 'creator' as god, nature, or merely your parents (which one?) seems to<br>
be irrelevant, but the D of I is not looked upon by the Supreme Court in<br>
the same manner as the USC.&gt;<br>
<p>
The D of I is America's Articles of Incorporation, the Constitution is<br>
merely its By-Laws.  The By-Laws have no meaning without organic reference<br>
to the Articles of Incorporation.  When the Supreme Court makes decisions<br>
that are cut free from the D of I, it is acting as a law unto itself with<br>
no legitimacy at all, simply brute force *if* it can get the executive and<br>
legislative branches to acquiesce.<br>
<p>
ML: &lt;That the 'right to choose' is not mentioned is irrelevant, as it is<br>
implied that it belongs to the people, unless they delegate it to the state<br>
(which is where state laws can be used to outlaw abortion, and where Roe v.<br>
Wade was an improper decision, in that it presumed federal authority to<br>
restrict state rights which the poeple had previously delegated to them).&gt;<br>
<p>
You are correct about it being an improper decision and why it was<br>
improper.  You are incorrect that there is any 'right to choose to murder<br>
an unborn child'.  Prior to Roe v. Wade, it was unthinkable.  Roe v. Wade<br>
stepped in and redefined human in a most barbaric way for convenience's or<br>
expediency's sake.  The Justices deemed consequence-free sex to be an<br>
equivalent value to the freedom to murder the weak.<br>
<p>
Lee Crocker wrote 3/6/98: &lt;I believe there is, however, another<br>
responsibility that sometimes is overlooked: to actively resist, to the<br>
extent of one's ability, those forces opposed to the values of life.  I<br>
vote, for example, because if I did not, I would feel some moral complicity<br>
in whatever atrocities are committed by the government I failed to vote<br>
against.&gt;<br>
<p>
Naturally you should be voting against abortion as being antithetical to<br>
the values of life.  The atrocities being committed by the government for<br>
the last twenty-five years have stained the country and undermined any<br>
moral logic America once had in service to those values of life.  It's too<br>
bad the Supreme Court has never allowed voters to determine the definition<br>
of human in their separate jurisdictions, to see which consequences are<br>
most favorable to life.<br>
<p>
Arjen Kamphuis wrote 3/6/98: &lt;Besides that there are certain safeguards<br>
like a constitition (most western countries have one) that guarantees<br>
certain basic rights (such as not to be killed and such).&gt;<br>
<p>
The constitution is just theory on paper.  The guarantee of rights is<br>
dependent on the moral fabric of the ruling class.  Certainly unborn<br>
children (developing selves) have no rights not to be killed.<br>
<p>
AK: &lt;if you get it in your head to interfere in any way with anyone else<br>
who is excercising their right _not_ to have a child you'll be in big<br>
trouble.&gt;<br>
<p>
Instead of "exercising their right not to have a child," you really mean<br>
"exercising their right to murder their unborn child."  Of course, there<br>
are many, many individuals worldwide who cannot in good conscience grant<br>
legitimacy to such a horrible thing.  You'll have to get us all "in big<br>
trouble," and we'll resist in order to save the values of life from your<br>
brutality.  You may try to ghettoize us, as you suggested, but we won't<br>
make it easy for you.<br>
<p>
AK: &lt;the commercial usage of consious beings is totally unacceptable.<br>
That's just my opinion.&gt;<br>
<p>
Hmm...  Too bad it's "just an opinion," you will never counter John Clark's<br>
much more coherent case that he made for the commercial usage of conscious<br>
beings being positively good, to be sought for.  You have no basis to fight<br>
him, opinion or feeling does not stand up against certainty based on a<br>
coherent worldview (even though that worldview is entirely based on false<br>
metaphysical presuppositions of total digital existence).  John and his<br>
fellow travelers will prevail against you unless you can argue your opinion<br>
sensibly and tie it to a coherent worldview based on true presuppositions.<br>
<p>
AK: &lt;50 years from now someone else might be at the top of the foodchain,<br>
they could be fully _digital_, and they'll have web-acces to Exi archives.<br>
And they will be aware of you utter disrespect for non-meat, non-analog<br>
consious systems. Think about it.&gt;<br>
<p>
I'm not concerned about mythical "fully digital" conscious entities in the<br>
future.  I'm worried about fully digital killer machines set into motion by<br>
conscious entities.  The conscious entities will see my arguments for<br>
protecting the rights of the weak against the depredations of the strong as<br>
potentially crimping their style.  They will not like me and I will not<br>
like them.  So what's new?<br>
<p>
AK: &lt;When you think about it rationally (whatever that still means in this<br>
context...) it seems to me clearly immoral to allow all kinds of suffering<br>
when we have the means to end it (or most of it).&gt;<br>
<p>
Does this include the suffering of the many individuals who are in terrible<br>
pain helplessly watching the legal slaughter of the innocents?  Why isn't<br>
it immoral to allow this suffering to go on?<br>
<p>
AK: &lt;Under Dutch law the the status of fetus lasts untill several months (I<br>
have no exact figures) before the child can survive outside the womb.  The<br>
overwhelming majority of Europeans citizens agrees with this law as being<br>
ethical (are they all primitive barbarians?).&gt;<br>
<p>
The overwhelming majority of American citizens agree that European citizens<br>
are primitive barbarians and have been for most of this century, we've had<br>
to bail them out twice already from their barbaric squabbling.  They<br>
exported their barbaric ideas over here after WW II and within a generation<br>
our slide into moral decay began in earnest.<br>
<p>
AK: &lt;On one side we have a group of people claiming that one is human after<br>
conception because 'something' happens then even though they don't don't<br>
know what that something is.  On the other side we have a group of people<br>
saying that somewhere during the growthproces a fetus becomes a human even<br>
though they are not sure when precisely.<br>
<p>
Neither side seems to be able to bring 100% solid scientific or ethical<br>
'proof' for their opinion (at least I have't heard it). It then becomes a<br>
question of who's is going to force their opinion of who. No-one is forced<br>
to have an abortion (AFAIK). I respect the fact that some people would<br>
never have an abortion because they feel 'it would not be right'. That's<br>
OK. However, I do not think that gives anyone the right to enforce their<br>
opinions on others.  The _problem_ is of course that those who are against<br>
abortion feel that the fetus being aborted is a human who is killed based<br>
on the opinion of others.  And then we're full circle.  I do not know if<br>
it's possible to break this so I'll choose for individual freedom of<br>
choice.&gt;<br>
<p>
This seems like a fairly reasonable recap.  A couple of points to ponder. <br>
You'll choose for individual freedom of choice, do you mean the unborn<br>
child's freedom of choice?  I didn't think so.  The developing self is weak<br>
and the mother is strong, not an equal standing, and the damage to society<br>
being able to uphold the values of life is due in part to the very obvious<br>
fact that the mother lays down her guardianship role, the keystone of civil<br>
society, to "choose" to murder her own unborn child.  When the keystone<br>
falls, society falls.  When mothers don't value their own unborn children,<br>
no moral logic persuades anyone to value any children at all.<br>
<p>
When you say "one is human after conception because 'something' happens<br>
then even though they don't know what that something is," you are<br>
misrepresenting my position.  Conception initiates the development of a<br>
self.  From conception onward, we can alter the environmental factors and<br>
the genetic makeup that largely determine individuality.  Before<br>
conception, any alteration to environmental factors or genetic makeup<br>
associated with any constituent biological precursors are allowed because<br>
there is no assurance that conception will occur.  It is only when<br>
conception occurs that "selection" has taken place - success.  We are no<br>
longer tampering with our own developing self, we are tampering with<br>
another developing self without that self's consent.  Because it is without<br>
consent, society has a right, through the political process, to ensure that<br>
the tampering is in the best interest of the unborn child according to the<br>
wisdom embodied in society's ideals and accumulated experience.  It is a<br>
similar situation to how society deals with resident non-citizens and with<br>
individuals mentally or physical unable to enter into contracts.<br>

RJ: &lt;I read recently where China has 53 million missing females, they are<br>
statistically expected from normal demographic trends but simply not<br>
there.&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;You think something is true just because you read it.&gt;<br>
<p>
C'mon, you can insult me more cleverly than this.  I have closely read many<br>
accounts over the years of the Chinese death-lords in their effort to<br>
manage their population growth.  This statistic accords well with the depth<br>
of these accounts.  Go do your own research if you're really interested, it<br>
makes for really gruesome reading.<br>
<p>
HN: &lt;Abortion laws restrict abortions by trimester.  Please reference a<br>
specific law that allows abortion on the due date while the baby is 2/3 out<br>
of the birth canal....  Ninth month abortions are not legal, even though<br>
you argue that they might as well be.  You can't legally find a place that<br>
will do this for you, even if you can easily find such a place with little<br>
risk of prosecution.  Roe vs. Wade did not legalize what you discribe, even<br>
if what you are discribing is actually happening in the same clinics that<br>
are legalized by Roe vs. Wade.&gt;<br>
<p>
Let me clarify this.  I am going to quote from "Before the Shooting Begins"<br>
by James Davison Hunter (1994) pgs. 247-249:  "In 1973 Justice Harry<br>
Blackmun wrote the majority opinion for the Supreme Court, arguing that a<br>
woman's decision to terminate or continue her pregnancy is a fundamental<br>
right, part of a 'right of privacy.' [...] In Roe itself, abortion was<br>
proscribed after viability, yet after viability (measured typically at the<br>
end of the sixth month) states must permit abortions that are necessary to<br>
preserve maternal life or health.  In Roe's companion decision, Doe v.<br>
Bolton, the court defined 'health' as 'all factors... relevant to the<br>
well-being of the patient - including emotional, psychological, familial<br>
[factors] and the woman's age.'  [...] Subsequent decisions not only<br>
reaffirmed Roe but extended its interpretation, overturning virtually every<br>
effort to restrict the practice of abortion.  [Examples incl. Planned<br>
Parenthood v. Danforth (1976), City of Akron v. Akron Center for<br>
Reproductive Health, Inc. (1983), Thornburgh v. American College of<br>
Obstetricians and Gynecologists (1986).]  What was so unique about this<br>
evolving law was that it forbade *any* state regulation of abortion for the<br>
sake of preserving the fetus until viability.  Even after viability there<br>
would be no federal regulation oriented toward protecting the fetus until<br>
birth.  [...] In practice, then, a pregnant woman could get an abortion at<br>
any time during pregnancy if she desired it and if a single doctor (who<br>
might be the one performing the abortion) judged the abortion necessary to<br>
preserve her health (broadly construed to include a notion of well-being). <br>
In sum, Roe was a 'compromise.'  It did not technically permit abortion on<br>
demand for the full nine months.  On the other hand, by defining abortion<br>
as a 'fundamental right' and striking down efforts 'to protect the<br>
developing fetus' in challenges subsequent to Roe, the Supreme Court did<br>
provide a foundation for the practice of abortion on demand for the full<br>
nine months."<br>

RJ: &lt;When I drive by the local abortion "clinic" every day, I am acutely<br>
aware that I am driving by a Nazi or Stalinist death camp.&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;I think that just about ends the discussion, don't you?&gt;<br>
<p>
By all accounts, German and Russian citizens living next to their own death<br>
camps did not engage in much discussion about them, either.  Nasty topic,<br>
not very comfortable.<br>

den Otter wrote 3/6/98:<br>
&lt;For the record, here's part of my ideology:<br>
<p>
Pro:  Abortion (pro choice, not squeamish about number of months of<br>
pregnancy).<br>
[...]<br>
Con:  Murder...&gt;<br>
<p>
Hmmm...  Something's fishy here.<br>

Berrie Staring wrote 3/6/98: &lt;don't do to anyone/anything what you don't<br>
want to be done to you. I think it's almost a natural law.&gt;<br>
<p>
Then mothers most likely shouldn't murder their unborn children since they<br>
probably don't want to be murdered themselves.<br>
<p>
Doug Bailey wrote 3/5/98: &lt;As I see it, the abortion debate has very little<br>
to do with the value of life or what it is to be human.  Its purely about<br>
individual freedom.&gt;<br>
<p>
Individual freedom for the unborn child?  Only if freedom = death.<br>

Arjen Kamphuis wrote 3/9/98: &lt;As long as no coercion is involved it seems<br>

<p>
I am trying to figure out how to keep millions of unborn children<br>
(developing selves) from being coerced to death each year.  I don't know<br>
them and they are living thousands of miles away, is this a very Extropian<br>
thing to do?<br>
