<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Did anyone see the recent PBS documentary series</i><br>
<i>&gt;called "Liberty - The American Revolution"?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It was an excellently produced program using the</i><br>
<i>&gt;actual words from letters of the people involved</i><br>
<i>&gt;with a minimum of commentary - a la Ken Burns'</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Civil War".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What struck me was the episode which covered the</i><br>
<i>&gt;creation of the constitution.  Having just read</i><br>
<i>&gt;Spooner's "No Treason: the Constitution of No</i><br>
<i>&gt;Authority" just a month or so ago, I was really</i><br>
<i>&gt;shocked by my reaction to the documentary at this</i><br>
<i>&gt;point.  The commentators were visibly elated and</i><br>
<i>&gt;waxing patriotic on this incredible achievement</i><br>
<i>&gt;of mankind, and where previously I would have</i><br>
<i>&gt;joined in the chorus of angelic voices, I found</i><br>
<i>&gt;myself saying to the TV: "No, No, don't do it!</i><br>
<i>&gt;You'll ruin everything!" - like I was watching</i><br>
<i>&gt;a movie where the victim is walking into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;predator's trap but doesn't know it. You've</i><br>
<i>&gt;watched the movie intently and then you find</i><br>
<i>&gt;yourself wanting to shout, "Don't go in there!</i><br>
<i>&gt;He's got a gun!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I saw the constitutional convention with new eyes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The  arguments of the anti-federalists were so</i><br>
<i>&gt;prophetic.  They warned against the tyranny of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the democratic mob while the federalists countered</i><br>
<i>&gt;with "what, are we going to enslave _ourselves_?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;One conventioneer said, regarding the bill of</i><br>
<i>&gt;rights, to the effect: "We don't need a piece of</i><br>
<i>&gt;paper to tell us our rights, and no piece of paper</i><br>
can protect our rights should someone chose to<br>
<i>&gt;violate them."  And this guy was a federalist,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and _against_ the addition of the bill of rights</i><br>
<i>&gt;for this very reason!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The contradictions in this piece of history are</i><br>
<i>&gt;glaring. The  colonists had just fought a long</i><br>
<i>&gt;and bloody war against tyranny, and almost</i><br>
<i>&gt;immediately set about the construction of an</i><br>
<i>&gt;all-comsuming federal monolith to take the place</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the king. Replacing a capricious monarch with</i><br>
<i>&gt;a capricious mob - to be staffed and run by....</i><br>
<i>&gt;who else? ...the conventioneers themselves! The</i><br>
<i>&gt;convention was carried on in strict secrecy so</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the public would not know what was being</i><br>
<i>&gt;considered before the delegates had a chance</i><br>
<i>&gt;to return home and get a head start on greasing</i><br>
<i>&gt;the wheels of public opinion with carefully</i><br>
<i>&gt;crafted arguments.  The final contradiction on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "birth of Democracy" was the fact that this</i><br>
<i>&gt;"democratic vote"  that would be taken to usher</i><br>
<i>&gt;it in would be restricted to the "representatives"</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a fraction of the non-slave, wealthy, white</i><br>
<i>&gt;land owners! (i.e., "We The People")</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My point in bringing this up within the peme</i><br>
<i>&gt;discussion is this: The facts were presented well,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but the underpinning of the whole presentation</i><br>
<i>&gt;was the glorification of the submerged collective</i><br>
<i>&gt;peme of "Democracy".  I felt the tug of "national</i><br>
<i>&gt;pride" and heard the violins playing in my head,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but it didn't work this time.  In times past I</i><br>
<i>&gt;would have welled up with a few patriotic tears</i><br>
<i>&gt;and looked for the nearest flag so as to pledge</i><br>
<i>&gt;my allegiance to it. Amazing what a little reading</i><br>
<i>&gt;and critical thinking can do, eh?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is an interesting discussion to be had in</i><br>
<i>&gt;analyzing the history of the revolution, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;players involved, and the  commencement of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;building of the national "peme infrastructure"</i><br>
<i>&gt;that followed in America.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
"Democracy" is certainly an important peme used<br>
extensively by politicians to increase their power.<br>
<p>
Many people have strong emotions attached to their<br>
deepest pemes, notably the "patriotic" ones.<br>
<p>
You've started the process of clearing pemes from<br>
your mind.  I hope you'll continue it.<br>
<p>
In my own case, it was also after reading Spooner's<br>
'No Treason' that I got going<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Don't waste time attacking the US Constitution --- more</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
You're right that more extreme measures are required.<br>
For starters, you can clear the "constitution" peme<br>
from your mind.  You need to attack the very *notion*<br>
of a so-called "constitution."<br>
<p>
Some 70+ "fleecing fathers" (James Hazel's term<br>
-- see '#TL070: THE "CONSTITUTIONAL" DELUSION'<br>
at &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl070.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl070.htm</a>&gt;)<br>
got together in secrecy and called themselves<br>
"We The People..."  The entire proceedings were<br>
a fraudulent hoax.  And what they produced -- the<br>
pretended or falsely-called "constitution" was and<br>
is no less a fraudulent document, a hoax, a sham.<br>
<p>
How much power would terrocrats (coercive political<br>
agents or terrorist bureaucrats) have in the absence<br>
of the word/peme "constitution" or any equivalent?<br>
<p>
The word/peme "constitution" is a lie in itself.<br>
Read '#TL07: The Constitution of No Authority'<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07.htm</a>&gt; and<br>

<p>
What Lysander Spooner and others have essentially<br>
indicated is that *the entire political system* is<br>
a hoax, a fraud, a sham.  Spooner also indicated<br>
that all the pretended "presidents," "ambassadors,"<br>
etc. were then and are now liars and imposters --<br>
"a secret band of robbers and murderers."<br>
<p>
The hucksters call themselves "president," etc.<br>
and the suckers believe them.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
This is a profound observation.  In the tradition<br>
of Stirner, Nietzsche, and Gurdjieff, the Complete<br>
Egoist has developed the ability to *question<br>
and challenge everything*.  The "clothes" of the<br>
falsely-called "Emperor" are his pemes -- literally<br>
(his "uniform") and figuratively (the words used<br>
to dupe his "subjects" into thinking that he's<br>
"special").  The egoist strips off the "clothes."]]<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Because that ordinary naked man is surrounded by</i><br>
<i>&gt;goons, he is different from you and me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Maybe he *appears* different, primarily because of<br>
the pemes in your head, the pemes in the heads of<br>
the "masses," and the pemes in the heads of the<br>
goons; and secondarily because of the guns they<br>
carry.<br>
<p>
In the absence of the pemes, how many guns could<br>
he command?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The words "president" and "emperor" are job-titles</i><br>
<i>&gt;for leaders of particular types of gangs.  If I say</i><br>
<i>&gt;so-and-so is a Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan,</i><br>
<i>&gt;does that mean I buy into the Klan's racist memes?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
They are commonly used very differently from job-<br>
titles -- among other things to imply superiority<br>
and inferiority: "master" and "subject."<br>
<p>
If you're a member of the KKKK and you call another<br>
member "Grand Dragon," you position yourself as<br>
inferior to him: "subject" and "master."<br>
<p>
If you call yourself "citizen" and you call someone<br>
"president," then you position yourself as a "subject"<br>
in relation to a "master."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When the FBI - excuse me, a certain set of terrocrats</i><br>
<i>&gt;who call themselves "FBI" - gave a certain other</i><br>
<i>&gt;terrorist the title "Unabomber", what did that imply</i><br>
<i>&gt;about their memes?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
He who places the label and can make it stick has the<br>
power.  (But when the gun's stronger than the label,<br>
it's time to run!)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If a certain "clever, lying trickster" has power to</i><br>
<i>&gt;interfere with my life in ways that other "clever,</i><br>
<i>&gt;lying tricksters" cannot, it seems to me that's</i><br>
<i>&gt;sufficient reason to give him a distinctive label.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I suggest "the terrocrat trickster in the white house"<br>
or some such.  "Slick Willie" also seems appropriate<br>
at this time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(As if "trickster" isn't itself a special label!)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
He who places the label and can make it stick has the<br>
power.<br>
<p>
<p>
Maybe many humans have a psychological need for an<br>
"emperor" in the same way that lesser baboons need<br>
an alpha-male to guide and protect them.  Maybe we<br>
should call it the "Emperor Norton Syndrome" -- see<br>
