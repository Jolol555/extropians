Opening Keynote Session: A World View<br>
<p>
The Industrial Revolution brought machines to make work faster and easier.<br>
The Information Revolution brought computers to make work smarter and<br>
faster.  The Communications Revolution speeded the flow of information over<br>
great distances, and brought people and countries closer together.  The<br>
Broadcast Revolution enabled the delivery of mass entertainment and<br>
information to the world.  As  the nexus of the convergence of the<br>
computer, communications and broadcast revolutions, what will the Internet<br>
bring?  Will it bring people closer together in virtual communities or will<br>
it isolate neighbors even further?  Will it enable a democratic society or<br>
a big-brother government and the elimination of privacy? Will it deliver<br>
mass  entertainment to more people or will it enable self-publishing and<br>
narrowcasting of information and entertainment to niche audiences?  Will it<br>
enhance our children's education and play or will it simply expose them to<br>
more sex and violence? The answer is probably all of the above, depending<br>
on the choices we make.  We have invited big thinkers and noted futurists<br>
to share their looks into the digital crystal ball.<br>

Show Me The Money:  Business Models That Work<br>
<p>
For entertainment on the Internet to flourish, a viable financial model<br>
needs to be developed.  Today, advertising support for Web content, via<br>
banner ads, is growing rapidly.  An alternative model relies on users to<br>
underwrite content through subscriptions or microtransaction fees. Others<br>
dream of an era where, like the golden age of television, advertisers<br>
sponsor entire shows. Alternatively, Web developers are looking to license<br>
content to content aggregators such as Microsoft Network, AOL or Sony<br>
Station and letting them worry about making money. This session will<br>
examine the small beachheads of economic success that have been achieved<br>
and how a sustainable economic infrastructure can be created.<br>

What Do The Buyers Want?<br>
<p>
As the Internet moves from an early adopter phenomena to an early majority<br>
reality there has been a noticeable impact on the media habits of web users<br>
as they spend more time online and increasingly less time watching<br>
television, reading newspapers and watching videos. What are the near and<br>
long-term strategies of the buyers of content on the web to capture this<br>
audience? How easily can existing brands be repurposed on the web and what<br>
does it take to create a successful new web based brand?<br>

The Living Room War: PC/TV or TV/PC<br>
<p>
Will we soon be watching TV and surfing the Internet from a single<br>
appliance? Will hybrid programming emerge that will use both media? What<br>
are the new creative and business models that this convergence could<br>
support? Does the TV ?couch culture? audience even care about<br>
interactivity?. Will a ubiquitous broadband environment be the ultimate<br>
technologic advance that will inextricably bind the TV and the PC into a<br>
single medium? These are a few of the issues that will be explored as we<br>
hear from leaders on all sides of this equation.<br>

<p>
In the 1940's, when the television industry was in its infancy, most<br>
programming was financed by television-set manufacturers, and it showed.<br>
The early 1950's saw the emergence of a unique new medium, with programming<br>
that transcended its roots in radio and theater to become a medium in its<br>
own right. Almost overnight, television attracted a mass consumer audience<br>
and became a multi-billion dollar industry. Both the entertainment and<br>
television industries were forever transformed by this convergence.<br>
<p>
Today, entertainment on the Internet is going through its own<br>
metamorphosis, clearly at an accelerated pace befitting the high-speed<br>
technology that underlies the medium. What will the new medium look like as<br>
it emerges from its infancy? The answer may depend upon whom one asks: on<br>
the one hand, Silicon Valley and the technology community which has given<br>
birth to the Internet; or from Hollywood and the entertainment industries,<br>
whose ability to capture mass audiences with stories and characters are key<br>
to the medium's growth.<br>
<p>
This two part session will look at the intersection of entertainment and<br>
the Internet from the often divergent  perspectives of the technology and<br>
entertainment industries. Part 1 will be comprised of technology leaders<br>
who will offer their insights into the evolution of the Internet from a<br>
telecommunications and computing platform into a mass medium.  Part 2 will<br>
be comprised of both the creative and business leaders of the entertainment<br>
industry who will look at the present and future impact of the Internet on<br>
the business of entertaining audiences.<br>
