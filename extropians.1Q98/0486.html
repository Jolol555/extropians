The Nation.1 website is at www.nation1.net, they have several mailing<br>
lists for discussing what should go into this new country.  I've<br>
signed up to see just what kind of ideas these kids will come up with.<br>
 I would love to see a virtual nation represented in the UN, perhaps<br>
it would make it easier for other countries to deal with the Internet<br>
if they can look at it like another nation.  But as i've said before,<br>
I think the whole internet community could benefit from this kind of<br>
representation, not just kids.<br>

as a<br>

<i>&gt; dealing with this Junior Summit or Nation.1?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nation.1 definitely sounds like something I'll have to look into.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; I read just this in a Nicholas Negroponte's recent Wired article</i><br>
about<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the upcoming Junior Summit:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &lt;quote&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; One topic on the table will be a proposal by five alumni of the</i><br>
first<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Junior Summit to start Nation.1 - a virtual nation for children,</i><br>
with<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; its own voice, flag, and currency, but without borders or</i><br>
centralized<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; government. This nation would apply for membership to the UN and</i><br>
make<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; every effort to include children from developing nations. Here is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; excerpt from Nation.1's first proclamation:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As a kid growing up with computers, you have ideas, you see</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; possibilities, but they don't count, you're just a kid. Adults need</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; kids, they just don't realize it. They can't relate to what kids</i><br>
have<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to offer, because they don't understand technology the way kids do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Kids have valuable perspectives, but the world offers no mechanism</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; voice their opinions. They have no representation in world politics</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and they have no influence in the decisions that govern their</i><br>
future.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; So with the help of the second Junior Summit, a group of young, very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wired individuals is going to bend, twist, and distort some barriers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with the hope those barriers will come undone. We are going to</i><br>
create<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a country in cyberspace, not defined by geography or race, but by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology and age: Nation.1 - a country populated and run by kids.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Nation.1 is just beginning, and we are considering how to create</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; digital political systems, how to deal with language barriers, how</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology behind the country will work. We passionately believe</i><br>
it's<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; worth it, because uniting kids changes their perspective, widens</i><br>
their<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; understanding, and leads to a better world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Proposals like Nation.1 may seem outrageous, even unthinkable,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; compared with what we adults would have suggested. That's the way it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; should be: ultimately, the world must go past what adults believe</i><br>
will<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; succeed. The global information society is ours only to dream - it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will be up to these children to live it out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &lt;/quote&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What I want to know is - why only kids?  I want to have my very own</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; virtual nation.  NOW! :-(</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; So here's an idea - make an extropic virtual nation and get</i><br>
ourselves<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; represented in the UN, how about TransNation?  or something similar.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Anyone have any idea if this is possible?</i><br>
