It is not pure efficiency here that one should look for.  For instance, a<br>
society which is more efficient at making war but less so at everything<br>
else can usually conquer others.  E.g., the Mongol invasions of China<br>
or the Roman takeover of the Eastern Mediterranean.<br>

The ethical superiority thing may or may not be so, depending on a<br>
lot of factors, BUT you are right to bring this up.  There is generally<br>
a "Whig" view of history -- that what is now is better than what came<br>
before -- pervading these sorts of discussions.  (This is not exclusive<br>
to Extropians/transhumanists.  Almost everyone I've talked to on<br>
anything like this is a Whig in this sense.)<br>

<i>&gt;be convinced that a gov't-less society is possible, let alone optimal,</i><br>
<i>&gt;when I see one exist and succeed.</i><br>
<p>
I think questions of right and wrong can be answered by reason,<br>
if you will.  I do not think they are totally arbitrary, but that is a<br>
discussion for another time.<br>
<p>
Greed is good!<br>
