Even an x-ray barrels through 4 gigabases of DNA like it's not there 99.999%<br>
of the time.  The only wavelengths DNA picks up well are some of the UV,<br>
and even there DNA absorption is negligeable compared to protein absorption.<br>

<p>
Only relevant for a carcinogen that spends an inordinately large proportion<br>
of its time bound to DNA.  For a carcinogen that preferentially binds to DNA<br>
as opposed to other cell constituents, yes, junk DNA would shield.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;hmmm... I think I may have something there, what do you think?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I should think you could find a carcinogen with a strong preference for<br>
binding to DNA.  That would indicate the junk has value in at least some <br>
situations.  To show that it's evolutionarily significant, you'd need<br>
to show that a reasonably large proportion of evolutionarily significant<br>
carcinogens had this property of preferentially binding DNA.  That would<br>
be hard, because, AFAIK, there's no good grip on which carcinogens are<br>
evolutionarily significant.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The idea that "junk" DNA provides a distraction for all those transposons</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; hopping around has been suggested, although I don't know where.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also a good explanation.  A good way to test this hypothesis would be to</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;look for transposon binding/recombination sequences in junk DNA.</i><br>
<p>
Not necessary.  Junk DNA doesn't have to attract things better than useful<br>
DNA, just equally well.  In the case of transposons that's no problem.<br>
However, junk DNA often does attract transposons as transposons often<br>
need DNA repeats or inverted repeats to do their thing.  Repeats are<br>
relatively uncommon in coding DNA.  Watch out for your causation, though;<br>
a big reason for all those repeats in junk DNA is that transposons (<br>
which have lots of repeats) blew their exits and got stuck.  <br>
