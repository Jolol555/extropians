<p>
The overwhelming cause of remarkable age in humans is faulty <br>
reporting.  The ages of very old people get stretched with<br>
time - somebody did a study demonstrating that the age claimed<br>
for people over 85 goes up 17 years every decade. The age<br>
calculation for this man obviously is very unreliable.<br>
<p>
Because of the reporting problems, the agency that assigns<br>
the "oldest human" title has become quite anal about verification.<br>
The best claim for breaking Calment's record to my knowledge<br>
is a woman in Brazil who is supposedly about 128.  Actually<br>
she does have some documentation, but not as much as that<br>
agency now demands.<br>
<p>

<p>
Potential lifespans aren't absolute; the chance of death never goes<br>
to 1.  With humans the chance of death seems to max out at about<br>
40% per year or so.  With enough people, or enough luck, you could<br>
probably get any age you wanted; it's just that the number of people<br>
or amount of luck required goes up fast and exponentially.  At<br>
40% deaths per year, if you get a maximum of 122 with 5 billion<br>
people, you would expect 132 with 1 trillion. So if economic<br>
or logistical constraints limit the size of your lifespan studies<br>
the maximum lifespan will be fairly constant - strain effects<br>
will far outweigh these statistical variatons.  Some guys did a 1 <br>
million medfly mortality study recently - and blew away the <br>
previous species maximum lifespan, which had been based on studies <br>
of thousands of flies.<br>
