Extropians,<br>
<p>
	The LDS (Mormons) are constantly preaching about their "Plan<br>
of Salvation" which to me is nothing more than an evil, hateful, and<br>
despairing plan of damnation when compared to extropian beliefs.  I'm<br>
constructing a response to these LDS teachings and have included a<br>
draft of this response here.<br>
<p>
	It seems to me that religions, or memes dealing with God have<br>
power because lay people think that such is the more optimistic thing<br>
to hope for.  But to me this is an evil mistaken and wholy unjustified<br>
belief.  To me atheistic and extropian beliefs are much more valuable<br>
and much more worthy of our faiths, hopes, and efforts.  I'm<br>
attempting to point such out with responses like this.<br>
<p>
	I plan on using such a response whenever some LDS person<br>
starts talking to me about their "plan of salvation". It is my desire<br>
that such a response will be contrasting and positive exposure to<br>
extropian ideas.  If you have a chance, let me know if I have<br>
misrepresented extropianism in any way or have any other problems with<br>
this.<br>
<p>
		Thanks<br>

======================================================================<br>
Issue:<br>
	What do you think of the LDS (Mormon) "Plan of Salvation"?<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
<p>
	There is much said and written about "God's Plan" in LDS<br>
scripture, literature, missionary discussions...  There is a fairly<br>
concise and brief description of the LDS doctrine of the "Plan of<br>
Salvation" or "Plan of Redemption" in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism,<br>
Vol. 3 by Gerald N. Lund and information can be found on the web such<br>
as<br>
<p>
  &lt;URL: <a href="http://www.cyberhighway.net/~vchopine/ldsdoc.htm#doc">http://www.cyberhighway.net/~vchopine/ldsdoc.htm#doc</a> plan&gt;<br>
<p>
But To me, such a "plan" seems to be much more like a hideous plan of<br>
damnation to be feared and avoided rather than any kind of "Salvation"<br>
or "Redemption" to be sought after and hoped for.<br>
<p>
	It is not my intent to be hostile towards any church or it's<br>
doctrines with critical articles such as this.  Rather, in my attempt<br>
to know about, understand, and have sympathy for what the LDS church<br>
and its missionaries constantly preach, I simply point these feelings<br>
and issues I have out as questions or as a response to this constant<br>
preaching.  If I have misunderstood LDS teachings in any way I simply<br>
want to communicate my current understandings in a hope that I may<br>
someday find these misunderstandings and achieve a better knowledge.<br>
Please don't take what is said here as hostile, but merely as sincere<br>
and possibly constructive questions and concerns I currently have<br>
about some common LDS teachings.<br>
<p>
	Within this "plan", for the few that are good enough to make<br>
it to the highest degree of the "Celestial Kingdom" and are<br>
consequently able to become like God, it is evidently their purpose to<br>
eternally continue what has been done in this world by our already all<br>
powerful and all good God, with their own creations, worlds, and<br>
offspring.  Evidently the goal being to eternally create yet more<br>
worlds like this one.  It seems to me that the more damnable,<br>
suffering, and unjust the world, according to this plan, the better.<br>
Apparently, if some spirit children are subjected to anything less<br>
than the maximum possible suffering, unjustice, separation... it will<br>
result in something less than the best possible God or fail to<br>
adequately prove only the best souls.<br>
<p>
	The story of Alma and Amulek in the Book of Mormon (Alma<br>
chapter 14) is a typical example that illustrates some of the<br>
attempted justification of some of the evil and suffering contained<br>
within this plan.  In this story evil people (as characterized by<br>
their lack of a belief in God) are torturing "whosoever believed or<br>
had ben taught to believe in the word of God" by doing things like<br>
throwing them into burning furnaces while Alma and Amulek watch in<br>
horror.  Amulek pleads with Alma to "use the power of God" to stop the<br>
"awful scene" and "save them from the flames."  But Alma responds:<br>
"The Spirit constraineth me... [the Lord] doth suffer that they may do<br>
this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them... that the<br>
judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just;<br>
and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them,<br>
yea and cry mightily against them at the last day."<br>
<p>
	To me such indicates that some of God's Children are<br>
necessarily (i.e. God can't bear any better group of children)<br>
hideously evil and that it is part of God's "plan" to find out which<br>
ones are this way by subjecting God's Good children to their hideous<br>
actions while he is not around so that his (hateful?) "wrath" against<br>
them will be just.<br>
<p>
	Finally, in that "last day", despite the oft-touted LDS claim<br>
that "Families Are Forever" many of Gods family or children will be<br>
judged and eternally segregated into various "lessor" kingdoms and<br>
eternally separated from God and the few good members which will<br>
evidently be exclusive members of "The Church of the Firstborn" who's<br>
families continue throughout the eternities, forever subjecting yet<br>
more children to such hideous suffering on mortal worlds such as ours,<br>
to discover which are the bad children and to produce yet more Gods to<br>
be members of this "heavenly" Church of the Firstborn to eternally do<br>
yet more of the same subjection to suffering and death<br>
forever-more... necessarily without a hope that anything better will<br>
ever be possible.  Should it make us happy to know that the purpose of<br>
this life is so we can find out which of our loved ones do not deserve<br>
to be together with the best for the rest of eternity?<br>
<p>
	It seems to me that within such a belief system one must<br>
either have a violent hate towards these evil children which are the<br>
cause of so much eternal suffering of the innocent and good or (as<br>
indicated by such violence as forceful "consignment" to lessor<br>
desirable kingdoms and forced separation from the best...), if one<br>
doesn't hate them then it is the ultimate in faithless despair.<br>
Evidently LDS believe there are some people that clearly know the<br>
difference between good and evil and have perfect ability to choose<br>
either, yet they still choose evil or bad for some ununderstandable<br>
reason.  How terrible, it seems to me, to be forced to give up all<br>
hope, to realize that some of your beloved family members would turn<br>
out to be so terrible.  It seems to me that there is no other logical<br>
possibility between these two very despairing choices - either hate or<br>
despair - within such belief systems or sets of plans.<br>
<p>
	To me, extropianism &lt;URL: <a href="http://www.extropy.org/">http://www.extropy.org/</a>&gt; gives one<br>
much more to believe in than such eternally despairing damnation.<br>
Rather than accepting and attempting to justify evil and suffering, as<br>
must be done if one believes in the existence of powerful and good God<br>
one can hope that all evil can be overcome and completely eliminated.<br>
An extropian optimistically recognizes and acknowledges the progress<br>
their ancestors have made to date in all areas including life, love,<br>
science, morals... and in everything.  to me, an extropian sees death,<br>
separation from loved ones, injustice, and most all of the worst evil<br>
that we now suffer from as simply the product of mortal foibles and<br>
lack of progress - i.e. something that can be overcome.  Our ancestors<br>
have endured and overcome many problems.  Thanks to this with a bit<br>
more of such continued progress we are about to overcome the most<br>
serious and painful ones such as death.<br>
<p>
	If one believes that there is an all powerful God, then one<br>
must abandon such hope of completely overcoming evil.  They must<br>
recognize that no matter how much man progresses they will likely<br>
never (at least not soon) achieve the ability to eliminate evils such<br>
as death since evidently the already good and powerful God can't (or<br>
shouldn't) eliminate it.  If a good omnipotent God can't even (or<br>
shouldn't) eliminate evil and death, how can we ever have a hope for<br>
or have a reason to strive to be able to do such?  Instead we are left<br>
with irrational theodicies or fruitless attempts to justify and accept<br>
evil.  The fruits of such beliefs are clear in the lack of support of<br>
fundamentalists in such efforts as the curing of cancer, aging...  and<br>
so on.  They simply give up and accept the despairing assumption that<br>
such will never be possible.<br>
<p>
	It seems to me that extropians, rather than attempting to to<br>
justify evil in these many kinds of (to me evil) theodicies, have a<br>
real hope that with a bit more progress and work (added to the near<br>
infinite and omnipotent work which has already gone before us), evils<br>
such as death can be overcome and will be once and for all eliminated,<br>
even possibly for all. (See Tippler's "The Physics of Immortality" for<br>
some examples of possible theories of universal salvation and<br>
resurrection.)<br>
<p>
	To me as long as there is ANYTHING that causes anyone to<br>
choose bad, or to choose that which they don't really want, they are<br>
not really free.  To me, agency is not something bad, or the cause of<br>
evil, or something to be made out as a scapegoat.  To me such<br>
despairing or hateful beliefs are at least as bad as believing in a<br>
malevolent God.  To me true free agency is something good and glorious<br>
and will only finally be achieved when everyone can finally overcome<br>
all of the many mortal foibles which cause sin.  We will only be<br>
really free when we all finally can make the right choices and get<br>
what we really want or by definition that which is good.  Only when<br>
everyone can choose what they really want, eliminating all causes<br>
preventing them from getting such, will everyone finally be free.<br>
<p>
	Rather than justify evil, Extropians, because of the evidence<br>
of the success of the works and accomplishments of all that have gone<br>
before, have faith in the possibility of, continue to strive for, and<br>
look forward to a day when they will be able to bear children into<br>
worlds where they can very rapidly grow to become very powerful and<br>
good Gods without all this lengthy injustice, death, evil, separation,<br>
judging, elimination, suffering...  An extropian doesn't die or suffer<br>
for those they love, they want to live for, enjoy, and be with all<br>
they love.  I have a hope that all will be able to be free and choose<br>
good or that which they really want and that eventually everyone will<br>
never be forced to do something like die and/or be separated or<br>
segregated from any loved ones the way we are now forced to do.<br>
<p>
	Many fundamental religions make similar attempts to theodicies<br>
or justify evil in the face of the belief in an all powerful and all<br>
good God and present similar "plans of salvation" or use of free will<br>
and such as scapegoats.  It seems to me that all of these problems and<br>
issues apply equally well to them.  Since I was raised in the LDS<br>
church their particular variation on these themes is the one I am most<br>
familiar with and the reason I have focussed on them in particulate<br>
here.<br>
<p>
	It is my feeling that such universal perfection and salvation<br>
might be possible and what I will forever strive for.  I will never<br>
give up striving for, having faith in, or hoping for such, no matter<br>
how much the various fundamentalist religions insist that I give up<br>
and accept their bad news.  At least not until it or something better<br>
is perfectly achieved some way or another.<br>
