<i>&gt; "A government which still celebrates the anniversary of a document</i><br>

<p>
Indeed, and now the text of the D of I is merely fodder for the favorite T-shirts of<br>
people like Timothy McVeigh.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; made no mention of the United States of America</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; so far so good</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (indeed, for that political</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; entity was not to exist for another 16+ years thereafter, and was actually a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; succeeding organization to the Congress under the Articles of Confederation.),</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Er, you mean 6 years?</i><br>
<p>
The D of I was signed in 1776. While the Revolutionary war dragged on till the Treaty<br>
of Paris was signed in 1783, The Articles of Confederation were passed by Congress on<br>
November 17, 1777, and were ratified by March 1, 1781. This Confederation lasted<br>
throught the war, and in 1787, a Constitutional Convention to draft a formal<br>
constitution. The Constitution of the United States, passed by the convention in<br>
September of 1787,was ratified in 1791 by the 9th ratifying state, New Hampshire,<br>
which also ratified the Bill of Rights, a Document of Constitutional Amendments that<br>
was passed not by the Contitutional Convention, but by the first Congress under that<br>
Constitution. Note that the main body of debate against the Bill of Rights' necessity<br>
was the argument that they were not needed, since the powers prohibited from the<br>
Government by these amendments had not been granted to it by the Constitution in the<br>
first place.<br>
<p>
So it took 15 years for the US Constitution to come into effect.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; so it has very little in relation to the Constitution other than sharing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; same author.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, the institutional author of the Constitution was a successor</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the institutional author of the Declaration, but that's about it.</i><br>
<p>
And Thomas Jefferson was both the Author of the D of I as well as the Preamble of the<br>
Constitution.<br>
