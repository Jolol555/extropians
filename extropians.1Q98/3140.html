Subject: Large Satellite TV Dish Receiver<br>

<p>
Please, forgive the intrusion, this is a one time mailing. <br>
We promise never to bother you again.  Please take a moment <br>
to read this message.  It could change your life.<br>
<p>
If you are fortunate enough to own a large C-Band dish and <br>
receiver, here is some blessed news for you.  The replacement<br>
follow-up is now available.<br>
<p>
I am a thrifty shopper, or at least consider myself to be one<br>
of the best.  I missed the best buy on the Net.  The lowest by <br>
far price can be found at SATMALL.COM for this receiver.<br>
<p>
Some of the features are:<br>
	1. Digital reception + the old analog<br>
	2. Everything is automatic<br>
	3. Updates downloads from satellite nitely<br>
	4. Remote control camera angle change (when broadcast in<br>
		DVD type format)<br>
	5. Modem inside with capacity to download from Internet<br>
	   at a blazing rate of 3.9 Gigs per second.  (Yep, that<br>
	   is 3,900,000 plus bits per second.  Compare that to <br>
	   your hot just bought 56,600 slow line modem!!!)<br>
<p>
Best thing about SATMALL.COM is the price of $679 for a new unit!!<br>
<p>
	Check it out, see what you are missing!!<br>
<p>
		satmall.com is for real<br>
<p>
