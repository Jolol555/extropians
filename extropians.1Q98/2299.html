<p>
In my opinion, this is exactly where the line between acceptable and <br>
unacceptable behavior must be drawn.  If it would cost me less to have <br>
prevented your actions from infringing on my rights than it would have <br>
cost you to monitor your actions for their effects on my rights, it is <br>
my responsibility to protect myself.  Otherwise, you have acted <br>
irresponsibly and should be required by some outside entity (a policing <br>
corporation, government, etc.) to make restitution.  Note that intention <br>
is not a consideration, ignorance or stupidity is no excuse, IMO.<br>
<p>
In this way a community can decide on a list of rights (the larger the <br>
community, the smaller and more basic the list, with communities within <br>
communities being a possibility) and individuals within the community <br>
can be maximally productive while their rights are protected.  An <br>
economic niche in such a society would exist for companies that <br>
identified which communities had rights that were unacceptable to you <br>
("Don't go to the U.S., they tax all of your income there!") and which <br>
communities were ideal.  Another niche would exist for advising people <br>
on what precautions they should take to protect the rights of others - <br>
companies could follow court cases (or whatever the mechanism for <br>
determination of fault is in these kinds of imaginary communities) and <br>
advise &amp; assist in behaviors that prevent culpable rights infringement.<br>
<p>
As a related topic, I see a lot of talk on this list about how <br>
geographical location is totally unimportant to Extropians, but I <br>
haven't seen anyone demonstrate how I can guarantee my ability to travel <br>
from place to place without travelling through an area in which the <br>
contractual rights are unacceptable to me.<br>
<p>
For example, if I belong to some entity (corporation, government, <br>
whatever) that guarantees my right to all of my property (no involuntary <br>
taxes or tariffs), and this entity is not tied to some relatively large <br>
geographical area, how can I walk down the street in front of my house <br>
with a guarantee that my neighbor doesn't belong to a group that has an <br>
import tax on what I'm carrying when I walk onto his property?<br>
<p>
Is there some basic libertarian fact that addresses these kinds of <br>
issues?  Also, I don't want a community of complete freedom or one <br>
completely free of coercion; I want some rights protected and that <br>
necessarily infringes on the right to complete freedom.  It also <br>
requires coercion to protect those rights.  Is this issue addressed in <br>
libertarianism?<br>
<p>
