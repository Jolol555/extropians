The mark of great standards is that they can be stretched, far beyond of<br>
their original application area, while remaining fully upwards-compatible. <br>
<p>
There are not many great standards out there.<br>

Indeed. And let us not forget what a sponaneously emerged or deliberately<br>
constructed malignant global worm could do two decades from now... Not<br>
only the marketplace would be ruined, it would probably mean many<br>
casualties. <br>

<p>
No attack can be ever cheap enough. M$ may be not the Blight, but a great<br>
paver of ways for one.<br>
<p>
But even M$ is not the foe. Widespread human ignorance is the real enemy. <br>
People purchase and employ things without understanding their modus<br>
operandi nor future implications of their actions. Worse, after the damage<br>
is done people don't understand that they are the party to blame. Instead,<br>
a convenient bugbear idol is produced, much yelling &amp; stone throwing is<br>
conducted -- after that ancient ritual things apparently can go on as<br>
before. <br>
<p>
This happens an all scales: whether sudden climate changes, reactor cores<br>
gone china, or the secretaries's wedged Win95 PC. After the event, much<br>
finger-pointing at the technical people is done, curiously intermingled<br>
with demands to 'having it all fixed, somehow'. <br>
<p>
There is an easy, albeit unpopular solution appearing on the horizont. The<br>
human race is at the threshold of splitting into many species. As the<br>
toolbox to implement such changes is both large and incredibly complex,<br>
the techies should be at an advantage. Will the point-haired ones, and<br>
their secretaries also make it?<br>

<i>&gt; of not knowing what my mailreader is up to is about as attractive as waiting</i><br>

<i>&gt; colors, although they forgot to catch &lt;font&gt; and table color codes.</i><br>
<p>
Let's hope that the great code cleansing after the release of the Mozilla<br>
sources will very soon result in a stripped, lean, crashproof Netscape<br>
version.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; will have to make it a standard, and that is obviously tricky</i><br>

The IETF guys are great, yet not optimal. Sometimes they also catch the<br>
