<i>&gt; |GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND THE LIMITS OF PUBLIC CHOICE THEORY</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |By Paul Marks</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Economic Notes No. 42</i><br>
<i>&gt; ||</i><br>
<i>&gt; |In the United States in 1960, defence spending was 12.1% of total</i><br>
<i>&gt; |output and federal welfare spending (pensions, unemployment benefit,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |etc.) was 4.8%. In 1980 defence spending was 7.3% of total output</i><br>
<i>&gt; |and federal welfare was 12.6%.</i><br>
<p>
This is the most rediculous figure I have ever seen!!  I am falling out of my<br>
chair right now with laughter!!  Annual spending in 1980 on defense was<br>
approximately $250 billion.  Are you actually telling me that over a quarter<br>
of a trillion dollars was spent on welfare during the same year?  Unless of<br>
course you do consider all the subsidies that corporations get (i.e.<br>
corporate welfare) as part of this welfare figure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |The wholehearted supporter of Public Choice might say that this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; |because more people believe that welfare spending will benefit them</i><br>
<i>&gt; |than believe that defence spending will. But the whole point of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |libertarian economic case is that such things as the surge of "Great</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Society" welfare programs benefit no one with the possible exception</i><br>
<i>&gt; |of the people who administer them, that such spending increases the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |very poverty it is supposed to reduce.(2)</i><br>
<p>
And this isn't the case for the military-industrial complex who has reaped<br>
trillions of dollars is capital during the same time period?!  The same<br>
companies who were padding their books with $1000 screws!?  Give me a break!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Partly, this is because these schemes increase the number of poor</i><br>
<i>&gt; |people, which in turn leads to even more welfare spending. It is</i><br>
<i>&gt; |like the rolling of a snowball down a steep slope.</i><br>
<p>
I'll agree with you here.  Over the long haul welfare does nothing but<br>
increase dependency and decrease innovation both in peoples lives and that of<br>
corporations who are not truly competing in the free-market.<br>
<p>
My only contention to the argument against welfare though, is we need to<br>
consider humanitarian alternatives for peoples lives as the become<br>
increasingly superfluous in an automated high-output economy.<br>
