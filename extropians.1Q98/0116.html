<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SInce when does all crime derive from revenge?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Revenge is justice, justice is law, crime is unlawful.  No</i><br>
<i>&gt; revenge, no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; justice, no crime, problem solved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But not all justice is revenge, nor does all law seek to attain</i><br>
<i>&gt; justice,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and given the existence of unenforced blue laws and the concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; civil</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; disobedience as a social responsibility, as well as all of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; non-criminal regulations, not all unlawful behavior is therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; criminal.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Can you give examples of justice that isn't revenge?</i><br>
<p>
WHile victims families may feel like they have avenged the death of<br>
their loved one when a muderer is put to death, but as far as I can<br>
tell, the death penalty serves two functions: a) it is supposed to serve<br>
as a deterrent, and b) it permanently removes from society in a manner<br>
that is far less expensive than life in prison those individuals who<br>
have proven their in ability or unwillingness to function in society<br>
with respect for the right to live of others. You may call it revenge, I<br>
call it evolution in action.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And if the law isn't enforced it doesn't relate to the original idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; of this message, which was to enforce law (I think.)</i><br>
<p>
it works with the one in the middle, the one about not all laws being<br>
just. It is recognised by the courts that it is the individuals civil<br>
responsibility to disobey unjust laws. If a law enforcement officer<br>
fails to enforce a law, they are legally to be considered accessories to<br>
the one who disobeyed the law, so unenforced laws are examples of those<br>
laws which the state disobeys, because they know they are unjust (or<br>
merely are 'unjust' to someone who has paid off the state).<br>
