I, personally, agree, but not completely...<br>
<p>
Yes, because if there is not a certain moderation, a 'natural deviation<br>
tendency' may grow and grow... <br>
<p>
And no, because it's very important to know Extropians' opinion about SOME<br>
'daily' facts..: Any movement that is exagerately closed in itself tends to<br>
disappear or become secondary... And it is not what we want to<br>
Extropianism... Got it, young babies???... ( Just learn a little more about<br>
Political Sciences, Sociology and even Philosophy... always,  if you want<br>
to ...).<br>

<i>&gt;It seems like many people posting to this list have forgotten what sort</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also, this is an *Extropian* list, which means that extropians are</i><br>

<i>&gt;even think of Extropianism as the quest to increase the quality of the</i><br>

<i>&gt;postings that come through every day.  You know what I'm talking about: </i><br>
<i>&gt;the one or two line response, the posts that ramble on aimlessly,</i><br>
<i>&gt;argumentative or insulting posts, etc.  Just because we're interested in</i><br>
<i>&gt;life-extension doesn't mean we want to use our extra time reading inane</i><br>
<i>&gt;or unthoughtful posts.  We are extropians, after all; our time is</i><br>
<i>&gt;valuable to us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So, please, before you send anything to this list, ask yourself if other</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropians *really* are going to be interested in what you write.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt;not, don't send it.  Just send the good stuff, well-organized,</i><br>
<i>&gt;well-thought-out and well-written.  Please don't send impulsive</i><br>
<i>&gt;one-liners or insults or incoherent ramblings; restrain yourself.</i><br>
