Tony Hollick:<br>
<i>&gt; [2] BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene, generic, E321) is a potent zapper </i><br>
<i>&gt;      of lipid-coated viruses as well as free radicals (Ref: Pearson &amp; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Shaw, 'L:ife Extension').  No side effects, five bucks a kilo. Much </i><br>
<i>&gt;      better than megadoses of Vit. C; and your threshhold of infection is </i><br>
<i>&gt;      raised by orders of magnitude.  Existing viral infections are </i><br>
<i>&gt;      suppressed.  </i><br>

Hmm, I got interested and did a small medline search. While most of<br>
the stuff tends to support your claims, I also found the article<br>
abstracted below, which suggests that BHT may not be as great as<br>
Pearson &amp; Shaw claim due to carcinogenic properties.<br>
<p>
[ It should be noted that many scientific biogerontologists apparently<br>
regard Pearson &amp; Shaw as coloful but unscientific (cf. Walford, _The<br>
120-Year Diet_). ]<br>

[Toxicology of the synthetic antioxidants BHA and BHT in<br>
comparison with the natural antioxidant vitamin E].<br>
<p>
Kahl R, Kappus H<br>
Abteilung fur Pharmakologie, Universitat Hamburg, Deutschland. <br>
<p>
The toxicology of the food preservatives butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) and<br>
butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) as well as the naturally occurring vitamin E<br>
(alpha-tocopherol) is described. In high dosages all three compounds<br>
induce in animals impairment of blood clotting, which can be explained<br>
by an antagonism with vitamin K. Specific toxic effects to the lung<br>
have only been observed with BHT. The other described toxic effects of<br>
BHA and BHT are less characteristic and often occur only after high<br>
dosage and long-term treatment. However, BHA induces in animals<br>
tumours of the forestomach, which are dose dependent, whereas BHT<br>
induces liver tumours in long-term experiments. Because there is no<br>
indication of genotoxicity of BHA and BHT, all published findings<br>
agree with the fact that BHA and BHT are tumour promoters. In contrast<br>
to BHA and BHT, vitamin E is not carcinogenic. On the other hand, all<br>
three antioxidants have also anticarcinogenic properties. The intake<br>
of the necessary high doses as for these effects are, however,<br>
contraindicated with BHA and BHT because of their carcinogenic<br>
effects. The present overview concludes that the concentrations of BHA<br>
and BHT nowadays used in food, drugs and cosmetics are probably<br>
harmless. In addition, vitamin E can also be used in higher doses<br>
without the occurrence of adverse effects.<br>
