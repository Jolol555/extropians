 In my example the demon did not tell the man of his prediction but now <br>
 lets pretend he did. Suppose also that the man, being of an<br>
 argumentative nature, was determined to do the exact opposite of what<br>
 the demon predicted. Now our poor demon would be in a familiar<br>
 predicament. Because the demon's decision influences the man's actions<br>
 the demon must forecast his own behavior, but he will have no better<br>
 luck in this regard than the man did and for the same reasons. What we<br>
 would need in a situation like this is a mega-demon able to look into<br>
 the demon's head. Now the mega-demon would have the problem.<br>
<p>
There is no need for an infinite regress of ever-more-intelligent<br>
demons. Let's say the man, although he doesn't know it yet, will<br>
decide to take the low road.<br>
<p>
If the original demon is able to determine this with 100% certainty,<br>
before telling the man its prediction, then why can't the demon also<br>
account for and predict the man's subsequent reversal in response to<br>
learning of the demon's prediction?<br>
<p>
The demon can simply lie to the man, saying "you will choose the high<br>
road", when he knew the man was actually going to choose the low road<br>
based only on his original brain state. The man does the opposite of<br>
what the demon predicts, but the demon, although having lied to the<br>
man, still correctly predicted the man's behavior from its own<br>
perspective.<br>
<p>
Of course, the man could be aware that the demon is aware that he will<br>
do the opposite of what the demon says, and the demon is aware that<br>
the man is aware that the demon is aware of this... etc. ad infinitum.<br>
But you don't need to invoke anything smarter than the original demon.<br>
The demon's ability to accurately predict the man's apparently free<br>
will is limited only by the superiority of its intellect. If it is<br>
only a bit smarter than the man, an third observer will find the demon<br>
to be consistently lucky, but still only slightly better than random<br>
chance.<br>
<p>
This all seems somehow analogous to our understanding of quantum<br>
uncertainty, and also oddly similar to a scene from _The Princess<br>
Bride_. Or maybe I just need to get some sleep.<br>
