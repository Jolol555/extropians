Uh, most of the people I know who are receptive to Extropian ideas are<br>
pro-choice; I don't think that those ideas will last long in <br>
fundamentalist christian anti-abortion groups. If we want to spread ideas<br>
then linking them to an anti-abortion agenda would be really dumb.<br>
<p>
Not that I think that there's anything wrong with individual Extropians <br>
taking an anti-abortion stance, since it does depend so strongly on your <br>
idea of when a person acquires rights; equally I don't have any problem<br>
with people voluntarily subscribing to legal systems which do ban<br>
abortion. But your claim that people won't listen to us unless we<br>
as a group are anti-abortion doesn't hold up to the slightest scrutiny.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Think of what 53 million</i><br>

<i>&gt;abortion fanatics just think of 53 million stomachs to fill and 53 million</i><br>

<p>
Duh... this is an issue that I find personally distressing, but the<br>
simple fact is that if there were 53 million more Chinese women there'd<br>
be 53 million *less* Chinese men. This is not a result of the legality<br>
of abortion, but the Chinese government's stance against multi-child<br>
families. Remove the government limits and most of those women would<br>
be alive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The arguments for rape, incest, life-of-the-mother and fatal defects are</i><br>
<i>&gt;rational, even if they prescribe tragic consequences.  </i><br>
<p>
But your argument seems to be that a fetus acquires rights at some<br>
objectively-determined age. In that case, how can an abortion be<br>
justified after that age even in these instances, and how can an<br>
abortion before that age not be justified for any reason?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When I drive by the local abortion "clinic" every day, I am acutely aware</i><br>
<i>&gt;that I am driving by a Nazi or Stalinist death camp.  </i><br>
<p>
I think that just about ends the discussion, don't you?<br>
