I must admit that the recent post by John Clark is not the one I must have<br>
expected from the extropian list, but sometimes the people who live in the<br>
Empire of the World have such a point of view that is different to<br>
understand for people that doesn´t live in a country that invaded dozens of<br>
countries because they were suposed to have the right to do so.<br>
Cuba does not have the kind of goverment that I like. That is obvious. I<br>
love freedom. But part of freedom is to let cubans have the kind of system<br>
that they want. Mr. John Clark talks of a police state. Who invaded Granada<br>
in the 80´? and Vietnam in the ´60? and Guatemala in the 50'´s and put all<br>
the worst kind of fascist dictatorship in every country in Latin America?<br>
Who supports the medieval government of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and a long<br>
list of countries organized in a way that are shameful for the humankind. <br>
Maybe all of us live in a police state, but United States police loves<br>
traveling, and if you will talk of trade  you should know that your free<br>
market country prohibits to exchange trade with Cuba. <br>
"Castro  did not inherit a poor country, in 1959 it had the third highest<br>
standard of living in the western hemisphere, only the USA and Canada were<br>
higher. The fact that for a few days in 1962 Castro brought the human race<br>
closer to the brink of extinction than anytime in the last ten thousand<br>
years does not <br>
increase my admiration of him".<br>
You are supposed to defend the previous goverment, a worst dictatorship than<br>
this, saying that Cuba was the third country by quality of life in 1959.<br>
That is at least inexact. You say "25% of the population,  <br>
have abandoned Cuba and the didn't go to the USSR, they went to a  <br>
capitalistic country". That is very obvious, they fled because they were<br>
capitalistic people and they are the very rich latins of the United States.<br>
And the last thing is really astonishing. The bad Castro put us all closer<br>
to the brink of extinction? But who threw the atomic bombs? Who has the<br>
nuclear power to destroy us all?  United States and its satelite Israel, and<br>
probably Russia.<br>
It´s not Cuba, nor Granada.<br>
"The sad thing is that you not only oppose a free market in money and goods <br>
but also ideas." <br>
I hope you don´t also accuse me to be opposed to a free market of ideas, but<br>
is your police country that does. <br>
I do know that people in my country that need the best medical help must go<br>
to Cuba, and I know that blocking the economy of a little island is not the<br>
way to fight against a system that I do not agree.<br>
If I love Internet is because it goes beyond any blockade, even if it is<br>
from the brain.<br>
Sorry for my english, my first lenguage is spanish, and sorry for not being<br>
too much polite.<br>
