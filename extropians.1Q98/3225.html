<i>&gt;         &gt;Proving your innocence is done by, for example, demonstrating that </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;you weren't at the scene of the crime at the time of the murder  </i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't prove I wasn't at the scene of most murders, neither can you.</i><br>
<p>
You can if you document your life (mini audio/video) and/or others, like<br>
the government are doing it for you. Monitoring most streets and other<br>
public places is completely feasible even with today's technology. Apart<br>
from that, forensics have gotten pretty good too.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Only one (or a couple in extreme cases) of all those thousands of </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;murders is relevant to the case [...] these justice computers could </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;be just a couple of simple PCs. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You seem to think that what's relevant and what is not is a simple matter to</i><br>
<i>&gt; determine, it's not, not in criminal investigation and not in scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; research. In the real world when you're confronted with a puzzle you always</i><br>
<i>&gt; have far more information than you can deal with, and much of it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; contradictory. </i><br>
<p>
Certainly not all cases are *that* difficult. Taped crimes are pretty<br>
straigtforward,<br>
and the criminals hardly ever bother to try to debunk recorded (video etc.)<br>
evidence, _when they're guilty_ After all, what is there left to say. More<br>
surveillance means more recorded crimes (after all, most criminals aren't too<br>
bright) which means more clearcut cases that can be handled by the central<br>
justice computer (the purpose of which is to maintain consequence in judicial<br>
matters, elliminating whimsical decisions where possible). It may not be the<br>
'magic bullet', but it sure would be an improvement over the present situation,<br>
and that's what counts. Really tough cases could be left to (teams of) human <br>
judges ('till the advent of AI), who would only have to take care of a fraction of<br>
the<br>
cases due to automatization. Precedent would be binding to assure maximal<br>
consequence of justice. Systems that work on this basis automatically get <br>
better with time. Judges would be required to take "common sense" tests as<br>
part of their training.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The central justice computer simply </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is nothing simple about finding the truth, it's hard work and it takes </i><br>
<i>&gt; a brain, that's what the organ is for.</i><br>
<p>
Recorded cases are almost always simple, and they will become the majority<br>
of cases as surveillance becomes omnipresent. As a bonus, the crimes that<br>
threaten society most like street violence will be hit the hardest by increased<br>
surveillance.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;         &gt;presents all the facts of a particular case in a comprehensive</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;matter. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's a matter of opinion, some will say something is a fact, others will say</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's a fancy. And the facts are never comprehensive, the holes must be filled</i><br>
<i>&gt; in with conjecture. There is a name for this procedure, judgment, and it</i><br>
<i>&gt; takes intelligence that PC's don't have yet.</i><br>
<p>
If the tape shows some guys beating an old lady and taking her wallet then there<br>
is little left to the imagination. Many cases are in fact quite simple, because<br>
many offenders are dumb. Miss Marple-esque murder mysteries aren't exactly<br>
the rule, you know.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;If the points of the prosecution haven't been refuted, then the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;conclusion is simple: guilty. It's basically the same system we use</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;today, </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not where I live, and not where I want to live.</i><br>
<p>
If the prosecution has made a strong case, you will be convicted in *any*<br>
country. Where the burden of proof exactly lies isn't that important, what <br>
counts is who can produce conclusive evidence. When in doubt, don't<br>
convict (but keep a possibility open for a retrial). This seems like a pretty<br>
secure system. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;only a guilty person would be nervous if the police brought him in</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;for questioning [...]  like dripping water on forehead -- doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;leave a mark and is extremely effective. [...]  There is a clear</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;limit to this process (say a week or two). If there still are no</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;results the suspect is released (and monitored) while the police</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;re-evaluate the case.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Guilty or innocent it makes no difference, when your police knock on my door</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the middle of the night I would feel utter terror. I would also feel</i><br>
<i>&gt; hopeless despair, because I'd know that my nightmare is only beginning and</i><br>
<i>&gt; will never end this side of the grave. If I'm lucky I will undergo two weeks</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Chinese water torture and then be released, for a while. My ordeal could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; repeated many times and at any time. </i><br>
<p>
No, obviously there would have to be strict rules regarding the further <br>
questioning of suspects and re-opening the trial. Cases like O.J. Simpson, <br>
where an obvious murderer can never be brought to justice because <br>
the judicial system fucked up the first time around must be prevented<br>
however. This means that even if someone has initially been found innocent,<br>
he *can* be tried for the same crime at a later date if new evidence comes<br>
up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I'm unlucky I will be painfully and</i><br>
<i>&gt; horribly tortured by skilled professionals until death finally sets me free.</i><br>
<p>
No such luck. You may temporarily pass out at best ;-) Unless of course<br>
you mean the torture that is applied to especially cruel/multiple murderers,<br>
which they duly deserve.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do you really find it hard to understand why anybody and everybody would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; more than nervous when police bring them in?</i><br>
<p>
That depends on the public's trust in the system, the PR of the police etc. If that<br>
is good, people won't be too scared when politely asked to come to down to the<br>
station. Most of the investigation has been done in secret anyway, so that the<br>
suspect isn't aware that the police are on to him and may incriminate himself<br>
further by his actions. At the stage that someone is requested to appear at a<br>
hearing it must already be 99% (so to speak) sure that he's guilty.<br>
                                      <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;if you can beat the lie detector that doesn't mean you can go home</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No kidding. After seeing the inside of one of your torture chambers few would</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever go home again.</i><br>
<p>
How come? Torture is done with "surgical precision", so that no-one dies.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;although it can be used as minor supporting evidence to your</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;innocence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And major supporting evidence of my guilt if I fail no doubt.</i><br>
<p>
No.<br>
                                                              <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;If the servants of justice really thought you were innocent they</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;wouldn't have arrested you in the first place, now would they?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your faith in the intelligence and integrity of polatitions, the judges</i><br>
<i>&gt; they appoint, and other such servants of justice is touching but not entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt; realistic.</i><br>
<p>
This was meant as a bit of sarcasm, regarding the "innocent until proven<br>
guilty" idea. In reality, you are already more or less convicted (by everyone)<br>
if the police pick you up. And it must be said that in many cases this<br>
suspicion is justified.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;the slanderer should _prove beyond reasonable doubt_ in a court of</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;law that the accusations (slander) are true</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The court can issue any decision it likes on the truth or falsehood of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; book and it would not change my opinion of it in the slightest. The slanderer</i><br>
<i>&gt; should prove beyond reasonable doubt to the reader (not to a court) that his</i><br>
<i>&gt; statements are true, if he fails the slanderer is simply Ignored.</i><br>
<p>
Slandering isn't limited to books, and since many people just loooooove gossip<br>
and don't care too much about the truth, one has to prevent assholes from<br>
unduly ruining someone's reputation. Slandering is like trowing someone to<br>
the wild beasts (the dumb malicious people), and should be minimized in any<br>
decent society. After all, security and stability are among the main reasons we<br>
have societies in the first place.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Words _can_ hurt people directly </i><br>
<i>&gt;                               </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then hurt them back the same way, with words.</i><br>
<p>
The damage has been done by then, and is often irreversible. You might take <br>
the slanderer down with you, but that won't undo the damage to your reputation.<br>
It's better to prevent it alltogether, by law.<br>
