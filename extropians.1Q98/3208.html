<i> &gt;   GPS week rolls over from week 1023 to week 0000 at midnight 21-22</i><br>

<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;   Clearly documented in ICD-GPS-200, para 3.3.4(b)</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;   GPS receiver manufacturers responsible for their designs conforming</i><br>
<i> &gt;      to ICD-GPS-200</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;So the problem occurs the night of August 21, 1999, when the week counter</i><br>
<i> &gt;rolls over from 1023 to 0. This is part of the GPS spec but some</i><br>
<i> &gt;receivers may not have been thoroughly tested for proper operation during</i><br>
<i> &gt;this transition.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;The other slides indicate that the GPS satellites themselves have been</i><br>
<i> &gt;verified to have Y2K and rollover compliance, but some of the ground</i><br>
<i> &gt;support software is on older mainframes and has some Y2K issues.</i><br>
<i> &gt;I gather that the ground software would not affect the operation of</i><br>
<i> &gt;the satellites in terms of giving out good data, but would affect the</i><br>
<i> &gt;military's own use of the satellites.</i><br>
<p>
Thanks Hal, for digging that up so quickly. I got this reply from Garmin,<br>
the manufacturer of my hand-portable GPS:<br>
<p>
&lt;sales-talk&gt;<br>
<i> &gt; Garmin took Y2K considerations into account from the beginning of its </i><br>
<i> &gt; product development. As such Garmin products should continue to </i><br>
<i> &gt; operate after the year 2000. Products that display two digits for </i><br>
<i> &gt; year will display 00 for the year 2000, 01 for the year 2001, and so </i><br>
<i> &gt; on. If you are interfacing a Garmin product to an NMEA device such as </i><br>
<i> &gt; a plotter or moving map, you should check with the respective </i><br>
<i> &gt; manufacturer to be certain that these products can properly receive </i><br>
<i> &gt; the 2 digit date in the NMEA data.</i><br>
<i> &gt;     </i><br>
<i> &gt; Another important event for GPS receivers will occur on August 22, </i><br>
<i> &gt; 1999. This event, known as GPS week number rollover, is when the week </i><br>
<i> &gt; number transmitted in the satellite navigation message will change </i><br>
<i> &gt; from 1023 to 0.  The GPS week number rollover will not cause </i><br>
<i> &gt; navigation errors for Garmin products if operated during the rollover </i><br>
<i> &gt; event.</i><br>
<i> &gt;     </i><br>
<i> &gt; Some older Garmin products may need to perform an "auto locate" or </i><br>
<i> &gt; "search the sky" operation in order to acquire satellites and perform </i><br>
<i> &gt; navigation functions after the GPS week number rollover occurs.  In </i><br>
<i> &gt; order to facilitate our customers Garmin will issue instructions for </i><br>
<i> &gt; each product a few weeks prior to the GPS week number rollover event.  </i><br>
<i> &gt; All Garmin products currently manufactured by Garmin are Y2K </i><br>
<i> &gt; compatible and do not require any user intervention in order to </i><br>
<i> &gt; operate after the GPS rollover event takes place.</i><br>
&lt;/sales-talk&gt;<br>
<p>
I'll bring my GPS with me to the US in september, we'll see how it works<br>
out in practice.<br>
