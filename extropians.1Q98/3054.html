 A better way of understanding deflation (as opposed to the decline in<br>
prices of specific goods relative to some average) is to view it as a<br>
rise in the price of a currency. For significant deflation, think of it<br>
as a speculative bubble where people invest in the currency because they<br>
extrapolate past trends to justify holding increasing proportions of their<br>
wealth as currency.<br>
 The main reason this is bad is that nominal interest rates can't go much<br>
below zero, so that if deflation is -10%, real interest rates are an<br>
abnormally high 10% or more, preventing most people from borrowing, which<br>
cuts off a significant source of expenditures.<br>
