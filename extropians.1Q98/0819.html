The problem with this analogy is that statists are like Protestants too.  They<br>
all have different ideas on what to do with government once they are in<br>
power.  They might seem similar to us looking it, but that's like someone<br>
who doesn't like Techno saying, "All Techno sounds alike to me."<br>
<p>
One might even blast the analogy further.  Even though Catholics believe<br>
in a united front -- one Pope, one code of beliefs for all Christians -- they<br>
are factionalized too.  The history of Catholicism seems to be a history<br>
of heretics taking over.  Granted, not all heretics gained power, but it<br>
is interesting to see how the usual progression is whichever idea gains<br>
power was previously thought heretical.  See _A History of Heresy_<br>
(1976) by David Christie-Murray for more on this.<br>
<p>
In fact, it is usually those who argue for ideological unity wherein one<br>
person or group rules all others that create such factions.  <br>
<p>
For example, the World Communist movement, because each faction<br>
believed only one could be the vanguard, splintered into many <br>
antagonist groups, starting long before the Sino-Soviet split.  See<br>
_The Origins of Alliances_ (1987) by Kenneth M. Walt for more and<br>
more detailed examples of this phenomena.<br>
