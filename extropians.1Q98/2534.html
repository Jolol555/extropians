Stephen Hawking gave a talk at the White House tonight.  According to<br>
news reports, he predicted that the next century would see the human<br>
race substantially altering itself.<br>
<p>
"I don't believe science fiction like 'Star Trek,' where people are<br>
essentially the same 400 years in the future.<br>
<p>
"I think the human race and its DNA will increase in complexity quite<br>
rapidly," he said.<br>
<p>
"In a way, the human race needs to improve its mental and physical<br>
qualities if it is to deal with the increasingly complex world around<br>
it and meet new challenges like space travel. And it also needs to<br>
increase its complexity if biological systems are to keep ahead of<br>
electronic ones."<br>
<p>
Hawking's failing body has no doubt made him more aware than most people<br>
of the substantial need for improvements in our biological nature.<br>
Maybe all the "medical ethicists" who shudder with horror at the thought<br>
of cloning and genetic engineering would have a different view if they<br>
could spend a few days in Hawking's wheelchair.<br>
<p>
Hawking is practically a cultural icon now so perhaps his frank comments<br>
will help to open people's minds to these Extropian ideas.<br>
