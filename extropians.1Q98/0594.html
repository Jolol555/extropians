The first meeting of Midwest Extropians occurred as<br>
planned on Saturday, 10 January. In attendance were<br>
(alphabetically)<br>
<p>
Michael Bowling<br>
Michael Smith (myself)<br>
Edward Sona<br>
Steve Van Sickle<br>
Brian Williams<br>
<p>
(Thom Quinn RSVP'd; he was unable to make this time,<br>
but wants to be kept notified of any future events.)<br>
<p>
Good food and good conversation were had by all. We<br>
had a good time discussing various Extropic issues<br>
and getting to know one another. As I recall, we<br>
spent a lot of time discussing subjects such as<br>
cryonics, investing, science fiction, ExI, the<br>
Internet, various technologies we are looking forward<br>
to, the history and financial status of Alcor (Steve<br>
assured us that they're in good shape), ways to<br>
increase longevity, current events, to what extent<br>
Dr. Seed was or wasn't on the up-and-up, and a lot<br>
besides.<br>
<p>
We agreed that the meeting should not be a unique<br>
occurance. Next time, we hope to meet with a specific<br>
event to go to (for example, Brian pointed out that<br>
Douglas Hofstadter had recently given a talk in<br>
Chicago that was open to the public; the rest of us<br>
were sorry we'd missed it.).<br>
<p>
One moment I'll always remember is when Steve took<br>
out his Alcor dog tag (I forget what it's really<br>
called, it's the tag Steve wears around his neck to<br>
indicate to non-Alcor medical personnel the<br>
procedures they should follow should, Frank-forbid,<br>
Steve unexpectedly die.). Actually holding such an<br>
item in my hand made the possibilities of cryonics a<br>
little more real for me.<br>
<p>
We all agreed that the event was a great success.<br>
