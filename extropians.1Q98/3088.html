<i>&gt; &gt;Outside of ARPAnet, the entire internet here in the US does happen to have</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;built independently by corporations. It has the largest bandwidth and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;redundancy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of any part of the internet in the world. It also has the largest growth and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;commercial business transactions being conducted of any nation. This was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;not done</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with government money.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Untrue. Most of the universities that are part of the Internet were</i><br>
<i>&gt; not part of the original ARPANet project. Neither are the many thousands</i><br>
<i>&gt; of privately-owned servers that still make up a large minority of</i><br>
<i>&gt; internet sites. Corporate (ie commercial) sites have a higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; profile, but are have not been as intergral as the aforementioned</i><br>
<i>&gt; parties. Most new hosts are still placed on the Net via academia.</i><br>
<p>
As I said, outside of ARPAnet, which was an early network linking research centers<br>
and universites that did research for the defense department, all of the rest of<br>
the internet has been build independently of government. That state owned<br>
universities have hooked up to this can cause an understandable confusion, however<br>
just as many private universities have hooked up to the internet, and they cannot<br>
be construed to be government owned. They may be non-profit, but they are still<br>
corporations. The internet, however is not those academic sites, but the backbones<br>
that interconnect them, and those back bones are decidedly NOT government owned or<br>
operated. They are all privately owned, built by corporations with corporate money<br>
to generate corporate profits. Likewise the ISPs that provide local internet<br>
service are overwhelimingly privately owned, not government owned.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;If you think that the government is responsible for protecting your personal</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;security, you are severely misinformed. Police are only there to catch the bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;guy AFTER he has robbed, raped or killed you, not to prevent it from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;happening.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Although this may too often end up being the case, it is not what</i><br>
<i>&gt; law enforcement officials would claim. Real mileage may vary, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; their stated aims almost always include crime *prevention*. They</i><br>
<i>&gt; spend a lot of time (and money) talking/training/etc about it.\</i><br>
<p>
And very little time actually doing it. The proof is in the pudding.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;New Hampshire, which has open borders with three other US states</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;(one of which has one of the highest crime rates in the US, btw)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I love New Hampshire, but if New Hampshirites have a failing, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; that they love to slam the Commonwealth, usually for the wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons. The 1995 census says that MA is ranked 15th in violent</i><br>
<i>&gt; crime. One third of the way down hardly qualifies as "one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; highest". In fact MA's *rate* is almost exactly the National average</i><br>
<i>&gt; (685 per 100K). And MA's rate is dropping faster than NH's (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; admittedly, doesn't have as far to go).</i><br>
<p>
Being average has always been Massachusetts claim to fame and its major failing. It<br>
has also been the major cause of immigration from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. I<br>
was born in Massachusetts, something I typically try to not mention. The wealth of<br>
the Commonwealth is just all too common for anybody who posesses extropian values.<br>
<p>
And yes, If NH's crime rate were 1/10th of MA, it would be difficult for us to<br>
improve as much as Massachusetts does, especially as we spend less than 1% of what<br>
Massachusetts does on law enforcement,. Its a matter of diminishing returns as well<br>
as how smartly we go about it. Funny how NH always spends far less money to get<br>
better results at anything than tax and spend socialist states like Massachusetts.<br>
