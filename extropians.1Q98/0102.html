<i>&gt; In the future when all we &gt;H are uploaded and racing along at our own</i><br>
<i>&gt; speed, we will have a serious interface problem. Personally I am looking</i><br>
<i>&gt; forward to "the far side party" and am eager to participate. The only</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem is in the assumed exponential scale of development that all of</i><br>
<i>&gt; my backups and clones will have, as they race through the galaxy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Exponential growths leads to exponential growth in difference. Thus my</i><br>
<i>&gt; (or should I say "ours" about me and the clones?) backups will have very</i><br>
<i>&gt; different speeds.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How on earth are we gonna dance at the party? With so different</i><br>
<i>&gt; perceptions of time, Pitch and tempo will seem different to me/us all.</i><br>
<p>
But there could be a basic "party time rate" which everybody adopts<br>
(at least when dealing with each other). See Greg Egan's _Permutation<br>
City_, where the upload civilization in the second half has an<br>
"official" time rate, and then individuals in their home virtualities<br>
can run as fast or slow they want, given the available resources.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This leads to a more general problem. How are we going to share our</i><br>
<i>&gt; memories at the far side? Speech is out of the question I think. Way to</i><br>
<i>&gt; slow and imprecise. Being uploaded as I/we are and converted to pure</i><br>
<i>&gt; information processing, there must be a better way.</i><br>
<p>
We need some kind of universal semantics, an artificial "language"<br>
able to describe concepts well and in an consistent form which<br>
everybody can translate their mind-states to and from. That might act<br>
as a working buffer. But the demands on it will be great, since *very*<br>
alien ways of thinking will meet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps we should develop a generic human definition, so that all</i><br>
<i>&gt; interested transhumans, not only one self and clones, can share memories</i><br>
<i>&gt; and experiences? Sort of an icky thought. But who knows how a transhuman</i><br>
<i>&gt; will feel?</i><br>
<p>
Sounds like a good idea. Perhaps a better model would be a standard<br>
for mental representations rather than definitions, since we might<br>
pick up a few aliens on the way to the party ("May I present<br>
Threefoil-5-horoball-54, an intelligent flux-tube tangle I met in a<br>
neutron star just coreward of the Dumbell Nebula")<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; whew!!! sorry for the lengthy post. Had i had more time It could</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably have been shorter. (Wasn't that Mark Twain who said that?)</i><br>
<p>
I think he said it, but he stole it from Blaise Pascal, I think. <br>
