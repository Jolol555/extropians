Hal Finney wrote:<br>
&lt; An old idea for mechanizing creativity is to divide<br>
it into two parts: one is an exploratory part, which<br>
is highly random and throws out a lot of "crazy<br>
ideas".  [cut] The other part is the judgement part,<br>
which looks at the output of the first part and<br>
decides what looks good. In some models this could<br>
then feed back and narrow the search space of the<br>
first part. &gt;<br>

Back in October there was a thread about Imagination<br>
Engines, Inc.'s, Creativity Machine, which claims to<br>
do just that (<a href="http://www.imagination-engines.com">http://www.imagination-engines.com</a> )<br>
<p>
Hal continued:<br>
&lt; To say that computers can't mechanize creativity,<br>
you either have to say that this method won't work to<br>
produce creative artworks, or else that computers<br>
can't do the first or second parts.  The most<br>
questionable is probably whether computers can ever<br>
be able to have esthetic judgement, to be able to<br>
look at different artworks and say which ones people<br>
will find attractive. &gt;<br>
<p>
As I noted back in December, there is an essay by<br>
Patricia Churchland called "Feeling Reasons"<br>
available on the Web as part of an ARS Electronica<br>
symposium from September 1997 at<br>
<a href="http://www.aec.at/fleshfactor/subs/reasons.html">http://www.aec.at/fleshfactor/subs/reasons.html</a> which<br>
explains why autonomous reasoning requires an<br>
'affect' or 'feeling' system in order to function<br>
properly.<br>
<p>
Another (6-page) paper that comes to mind as being<br>
relevant to how 'feeling' might be incorporated into<br>
a non-biological system is Neven Tomov's 9604 paper<br>
in Complexity International online<br>
(<a href="http://www.csu.edu.au/ci/vol3/paper4/paper4.html">http://www.csu.edu.au/ci/vol3/paper4/paper4.html</a> )<br>
called "Towards Combining Artificially Alive and<br>
Artificially Intelligent Agents".<br>
<p>
In light of these issues, and as a 'response' to Doug<br>
Bailey's 'poll', I would just add that 'Strong AI'<br>
seems possible to me, BUT, it would have to be<br>
'grown' and/or learn on its own; in other words, it's<br>
unlikely that it can be planned or programmed<br>
according to specs the way we develop software today,<br>
otherwise it will never be creative on its own.  This<br>
is the big challenge for using it to control<br>
nanotechnology.<br>
<p>
Bruce Edmonds (at Manchester Metro Univ. in the UK)<br>
has some interesting papers on subjects relevant to<br>
this.  In particular, see Edmonds, B. "The Possibile<br>
Irreducibility of Software Artificial Life." CPM<br>
Report 97-14, MMU, 1997.<br>
