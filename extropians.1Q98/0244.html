<i>&gt; &gt;I haven't seen any local news coverage yet, but according to the</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         Actually, for what it's worth, the person in question (his name</i><br>
<i>&gt; escapes me at the moment) was shot from outside the prison.  Apparently he</i><br>
<i>&gt; was walking in the chain-linked outdoor portion of the prison yard when he</i><br>
<i>&gt; was killed.  However, the fact that a long-time assassination target such</i><br>
<i>&gt; as he was given *any* exposure to the outside world defies easy</i><br>
<i>&gt; explanation.  Perhaps the Irish government wanted him to be killed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
What I read in the funny papers ( I wont claim to their veracity), was<br>
that some INLA prisoners in another wing had gotten out of their wing,<br>
come across the roof, and shot the tory prisoner as he was being driven<br>
to the visitors center.<br>
