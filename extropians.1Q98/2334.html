It sounds like Marvin Minsky has a new book called<br>
THE EMOTIONAL MACHINE coming out soon.  There's a<br>
recent interview with Minsky called "Consciousness Is<br>
A Big Suitcase"  at<br>
<a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/minsky/minsky_p2.html">http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/minsky/minsky_p2.html</a><br>
<p>
I was reminded of this when reading Max More's two<br>
recent essays: "Beyond the Machine: Technology and<br>
Posthuman Freedom" and "Virtue and Virtuality: From<br>
Enhanced Reality to Experience Machines"  (see<br>
<a href="http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/writing.htm">http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/writing.htm</a> ) this<br>
morning, as well as by some of the debates over the<br>
weekend.<br>
<p>
Here's a brief intriguing portion of Minsky's<br>
conversation with John Brockman:<br>
&lt; In another 20 or 50 years, you'll be able to put on<br>
your head a cap that will show what every neuron is<br>
doing. (This is Dan Dennett's 'autocerebroscope.') Of<br>
course, if this were presented in too much detail, we<br>
won't be able to make sense of it. Such an instrument<br>
won't be of much use until we can also equip it with<br>
a Semantic Personalizer for translating its output<br>
into forms that are suited to your very own<br>
individual internal representations. Then, for the<br>
first time, we'll become capable of some 'genuine<br>
introspection.' &gt;<br>

P.S. For those interested in philosophy, Minsky<br>
spends much of the interview critiquing persistent<br>
vitalistic notions of consciousness in favor of an<br>
eliminativist approach.  This is after Brockman<br>
begins by asking about whether cybernetics had much<br>
impact on AI, to which Minsky responds, "Yes,<br>
indeed", but then adds:<br>
&lt; Unfortunately, that new domain was mainly dominated<br>
by continuous mathematics and feedback theory. This<br>
made cybernetics slow to evolve more symbolic<br>
computational viewpoints, and the new field of<br>
Artificial Intelligence headed off to develop<br>
distinctly different kinds of psychological models. &gt;<br>
<p>
He then moves quickly on to other matters ;-)<br>
<p>
Anyway, my point is that Minsky seems to be<br>
suggesting that dualism is primarily a result of<br>
vitalistic or holistic approaches when, as the title<br>
of a Hans Moravec essay once suggested, there can<br>
also be "Dualism Through Reductionism".<br>
<p>
An excellent recent paper on this subject is<br>
"Explaining Emergence: towards an ontology of levels"<br>
