instead<br>

or in<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; possibly a child with a parent that has died has a different tendency</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; towards criminal behaviour than a child whose parents divorced? </i><br>
Anyway, my<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; point is: I think it is ridiculous to say that single-parent homes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; influence criminal behaviour without much more evidence than "there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lots of single-parent kids in jail." </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First of all, I'm sure you realize that personal anecdotes can't settle</i><br>
<i>&gt; this issue.</i><br>
<p>
Definitely.  It's simply a starting point for my skepticism, not a<br>
justification.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have no doubt that you and your friends are model</i><br>
<i>&gt; citizens. But you may be unusual.</i><br>
<p>
I like to think so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I, unfortunately, cannot cite specific</i><br>
<i>&gt; statistical studies at this time. (I know there are a lot of them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; however, and I will try to look them up when I have more time.) However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if my memory is correct, there  is a strong correlation between</i><br>
<i>&gt; criminality and coming from a single parent home, even if the parent is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not poor. If anyone on the list can help me out with these statistics, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would appreciate it. I would be flabbergasted if, as you suggest, kids</i><br>
<i>&gt; from two parent families are more likely to commit crimes. However, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can prove it,  knock me over! If your argument is correct, then it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be a good thing for kids if all fathers dropped dead immediately</i><br>
<i>&gt; after insemination.</i><br>
<p>
It wouldn't necesarily be a good thing, but it wouldn't necessarily<br>
increase the crime rate, either.  In fact, the crime rate would probably<br>
drop as a result of the lower incidence of domestic violence!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Surely that must strike you as a bit bizarre and</i><br>
<i>&gt; counterintuitive, even without any statistical analysis.</i><br>
<p>
Not in the slightest.  There is a large body or evidence (sorry, like you,<br>
no reference at the moment) that single-parenting and divorces have a<br>
tendency of speeding up the maturation process, including accelerated<br>
puberty, etc...    I think with some minimal amount of support this would<br>
on average create a more mature kid less prone to criminal<br>
behaviour.(especially if that child was taking on the responsibilities of<br>
the other parent... just look at older siblings in single parent homes,<br>
they have a tendency to become instant-parents)  Of course, going through<br>
puberty years before your peers with no adequate support could definitely<br>
increase the incidence of criminal behaviour... I have no doubt of that. <br>
So, even if you can provide evidence that this phenomenon is not linked to<br>
income, I would still be skeptical of a causal relationship between<br>
single-parenting and criminal behaviour, since parental support is<br>
definitely not a function of income (or at least the connection is tenous) <br>
Thing is, how could you possibly put a value on parental support?  I think<br>
it may be difficult to show anything with statistics on this matter, or<br>
possibly I am making this issue more complicated than it really is?<br>
