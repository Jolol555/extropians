Anders cites Biol Psychiatry 1980 Dec;15(6):841-858:<br>
&lt; Where comparisons could be made, the performance of<br>
these "temporal lobe" [impaired] patients paralleled<br>
the performance of subjects acutely intoxicated with<br>
known doses of delta 9-THC. &gt;<br>
<p>
There is a difference between 'acute intoxication'<br>
and dosages desirable for nootropic purposes. <br>
Simplistic analogy: the difference between the<br>
'loosening up' seen in someone who has had 'just a<br>
couple' of alcoholic drinks, versus the<br>
unconsciousness seen in someone who has had 'too<br>
many' drinks.<br>
<p>
Anders, later:<br>
&lt; The problem with drug experiences (or for that<br>
matter a lot of our subjective experiences) is that<br>
they are highly unreliable - how much of the effects<br>
are real, and how much is just delusion? &gt;<br>
<p>
Is it delusion, or merely annecdotal, when certain<br>
affects are replicated time after time over many<br>
years of trials, under many different environmental<br>
conditions, especially when the subject has<br>
attempted, with varying levels of success, to achieve<br>
this affect with other substances and methods?<br>
<p>
Perhaps the more serious delusion is the belief that<br>
useful information can be obtained primarily by<br>
chemical studies of the effects of a single substance<br>
without sufficient regard to the "set and setting"<br>
influences that Michael mentions.<br>
<p>
&lt; What I worry about is that so many simply accept<br>
that the subjective very positive results correspond<br>
with real positive results - as a scientist, I want<br>
to find good evidence for that before I start<br>
endorsing it as a transhuman technology. &gt;<br>
<p>
Some real positive results: <br>
(a) greater interest in and responsiveness to the<br>
stories and activities of a child than is otherwise<br>
the case after a long day of work and study (as<br>
measured by that most important of objective<br>
measures, 'sparkle in the eyes', as well as<br>
documented retention of concepts covered); <br>
(b) contrary to the study of college students cited,<br>
greater fluency, flexibility and elaboration of<br>
literary expression (in personal journals - as<br>
validated at later times while in 'sober' and/or<br>
critical modes.) <br>
<p>
On the other hand, I've seen no evidence that the<br>
substance in question has any positive impact on<br>
ones' ability to perform mathematical or logical<br>
calculations; although, a little attitude adjustment<br>
is sometimes helpful for finding the logical (or<br>
syntactical) bug that has been 'hiding' in that<br>
program all day. How would psychologists (or<br>
neuroscientists!) set up tests to measure the<br>
'causes' of that type of 'ah hah!' experience, I<br>
wonder?<br>
