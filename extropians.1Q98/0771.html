<i>&gt; &gt; Another example is the United States, where unemployment is at a record</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lows attributed almost entirely to increased productivity in the economy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yawn. Your record lows have been refuted so often, it's getting boring. First,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you count the jobs. Second, the standard of living has decreased together with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the loans. Third, the accumulation of money has also increased. I have posted</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence for all of this before, but you will find it on my web page</i><br>
<i>&gt; (<a href="http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/documents.html">http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/documents.html</a>) in case you weren't there.</i><br>
<p>
Refuted by whom? Actually, the official numbers are wrong in the other direction.<br>
The government counts people who are changing jobs with even one day off between<br>
them as unemployed for that whole month. The governments oft discredited BLS<br>
statistics on cost of living (which is what the inflation rates are calculated from)<br>
have been wildly high compared to actual consumer behavior, and have totally ignored<br>
the productivity and qualititive improvements in a given product (take computers for<br>
example, and dont digress on to another discussion on this, the point has already<br>
been proven). All of this makes the inflation rate artifically high, so when<br>
compared to wage growth, the claims of the left that actual income and standard of<br>
living have been in decline is total and absolute hogwash. I and almost everyone I<br>
know is living a much higher standard of living than 10 years ago. Just take a<br>
computer. The peice of equipment I have on my desk right now I couldn't have bought<br>
for less than $50,000.00 in the mid 80's, if it or something comparable were<br>
available at all (its a PII 233, 64MRAM, 4.8gigHD). So for what I paid $900 for last<br>
month, I couldn't have gotten if I had mortgaged my parents house back then. You say<br>
a DECREASE??? EXCUSE ME???? Better put your head condom on buddy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; The only people who have to work harder are people too inflexible or too</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stupid to work smarter.  Average people would enjoy the benefits of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; progress a great deal more if they spent more of their energy accustomizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; themselves to it rather than resisting it.  Ability to adapt *is* an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; evolutionary advantage.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You have misunderstood me. I advocate many kinds of progress, from cloning to</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology. Much is pointless, like cryo, but I'd like to see it develop</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway. It just has to be cleverly used. People are simply too uneducated. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; we could educate the power elites, this would probably be good enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt; ensure a better living.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In a free market economy, it is highly unlikely that all the major</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; industries would be making record profits and unemployment would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; increasing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have the evidence around me. Our economy is as free as a bee (i.e. as free</i><br>
<i>&gt; as the power elites want it to be). Darwinian selection doesn't work very well</i><br>
<i>&gt; since people have gained the ability to destroy each other in large numbers.</i><br>
<p>
Your credit base has been wiped out by the assimilation of east germany and eastern<br>
european industries, which were hopelessly out moded. You guys are still in a<br>
tryptophan coma after thanksgiving turkey.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Too protect populations from people with power who don't have your high</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; moral standards?  Actually, there is a rather large difference between</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; European militaries and the US military in general (which may be tempering</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; your view).  In many European countries (Germany, for example) the military</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is used as an auxiliary police arm of the government, many times quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; violently.  This is simply not the case with the professional US</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; militaries, which have virtually no adversarial contact within the domestic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; population.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The military is rarely, if ever used as an auxiliary police arm in Germany.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most of the time it just sits around doing nothing. (They want to participate</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the coming war in Bosnia, but it remains to be seen whether they'll be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to do it. Our current defense minister won't take part in it, this is sure.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Still they buy weapons and cost us lots of money. I have to pay for this shit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't like that, but the less real government we have, the more I'll have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; pay.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
WHAT?<br>
<p>
Government used to be just delivering the mail, defending the borders, and coining<br>
money. Since the internet has proven that private industry can do 1 and 3 much<br>
better than government, all that needs to be done now is defend the borders.<br>
Anything else is highway robbery.<br>
