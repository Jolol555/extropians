Have you ever seen the NSA building?  Or how much fiber they have running<br>
into it?  I've heard that an excessive amount - which I thought would be<br>
used to spy on Americans - not until now did I ever think that perhaps the<br>
economic situation in Europe would warrant such attention by the NSA.<br>
Maybe it should be called the ISA...<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; crucial hub at Menwith Hill in the North York Moors of the UK."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This causes my bullshit alarm to ring loudly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1)The bandwidth of "all e-mail, telephone and fax communications" in Europe</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be quite high--higher than any feasible satellite channel.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) Where are the signals intercepted by NSA? nearly all are land-line</i><br>
<i>&gt; only, with no radio component, so physical taps would be necessary. This would</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly require colusion of the European PTTs, which are mostly run by</i><br>
<i>&gt; European governments. Why would they permit NSA to do this?</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) With serious compression, a phone call can be squeezed to an average of</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps 500bytes/sec. There are probably an average of at least one million</i><br>
<i>&gt; simulatneous phone calls in europe at any time. This is 500 megabytes (4 gigabits)</i><br>
<i>&gt; per second, requiring 43.2 terabytes of storage per day. the compression would</i><br>
<i>&gt; require roughly one million very competent DSPs. automatic keyword recognition</i><br>
<i>&gt; equipment would require at least an additional 2 miooion DSPs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I might believe that NSA attempts to intercept as much military microwave voice</i><br>
<i>&gt; as they possibly can in Russia, and that they used to do a lot more of that in</i><br>
<i>&gt; eastern Europe, but modern commercial landlines are a different story entirely.</i><br>
