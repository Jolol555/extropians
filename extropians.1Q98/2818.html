What is a crackpot?  A crackpot might be one who misunderstands a<br>
generally-accepted theory and, by virtue of that misunderstanding,<br>
claims to find a fatal flaw in it.<br>

<p>
Rubbish.  The statement "Ian=Ian" is not a denial that other entities<br>
had causal influence on Ian's nature.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and since nobody has ever been able to show</i><br>
<i>&gt; a single example where this claim is true</i><br>
<p>
(or what it might mean)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; -- showing A being A free from any associa-</i><br>
<i>&gt; tion to not-A --</i><br>
<p>
-- which is not an element of that or any other definition of identity<br>
that I've ever come across --<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; it cannot be said to be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; true identity theory,</i><br>
<p>
A definition is not a theory.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and logic therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; dictates that it must be a false theory,</i><br>
<i>&gt; particularly when the identity theory,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "A=A+~A," is never shown to be false.</i><br>
<p>
Because it is vacuous.  If it makes you happy to trumpet it as a<br>
revelation, well, I'm glad you have the freedom to enjoy it.<br>
<p>
"A=A" is *useful*.  "A = the whole universe" may be interesting in some<br>
contexts but where does it get us?!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even as the set of evidence supporting A=A</i><br>
<i>&gt; is an empty set, people go on promoting it</i><br>
<i>&gt; without so much as a second thought; in fact,</i><br>
<i>&gt; many of its supporters fanatically attack</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone who dares to questions it. It there-</i><br>
<i>&gt; fore follows that "atomist-identity theory"</i><br>
<i>&gt; is properly defined as a "crackpot theory."</i><br>
<p>
It is not for you to *define* another's theory.  (I don't go around<br>
defining Marxism; that's what Marxists are for.)  You may *describe* it<br>
as "crackpot" if you like.<br>
