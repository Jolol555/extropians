There was a really good program on the Discovery Channel about this<br>
whole subject. Some physicists are try to show that the reason life<br>
exists is because the conditions which are conducive to life, are also<br>
conducive to whatever cosmological processes create new universes. Since<br>
it is though right now that new universes are created by the creation of<br>
black holes in ours, and that ours must have sprung from a similar<br>
singularity in another universe, whatever the cosmological parameters we<br>
have now are in the range which are most likely to be produced by a<br>
singularity in another universe, and are most likely to create as many<br>
other similar universes from singularities in ours, as a sort of<br>
darwinian probablistic natural selection on a multiversal scale. We are<br>
a side effect.<br>
<p>
There are now not only scientists trying to prove this theory, but also<br>
some that are trying to disprove it.<br>
