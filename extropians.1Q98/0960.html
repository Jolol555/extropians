First of all, thanks to all those who have provided input. I especially<br>
like David Musick's view of technology as being under distributed<br>
control - there are some good analogies which can be drawn with this and<br>
technology itself, such as robotics. I intend a major part of my<br>
response to be that technology is self-guided and therefore centralised<br>
control (ie. governmental intervention) is unnecessary.<br>
<p>
For one example of the difficulty of control/policy-making I am going to<br>
use (surprise surprise) cloning. I have not saved many of the emails on<br>
this list about the issue - how quickly does the archive appear on the<br>
web? If I can access the list postings from last week and earlier it<br>
would be great. If not, it would be good to get some pointers towards<br>
good web sites which treat the issue (although I suspect a quick web<br>
search will do the trick).<br>
<p>
Also, I am looking for a technology which does not seem to be<br>
acknowledged by government in policy (yet...) but which may provide<br>
dilemma in the future. Would Artificial Intelligence be appropriate? As<br>
a computer science undergrad this would be my preference, but if anyone<br>
has any better suggestions I would gratefully receive them.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Brad.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; 	Why do you think the image of modern technology being 'out of</i><br>
<i>&gt; control' has such a strong appeal? In what ways does technology appear</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficult to control? For some of the problems you identify, explore</i><br>
<i>&gt; their implications for government policy-makers. Provide examples for</i><br>
<i>&gt; your arguments.</i><br>
