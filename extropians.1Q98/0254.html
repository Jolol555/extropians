Of course. However, the feature of extropianism/transhumanism that<br>
interests young people a lot is the idea of getting smart without all of<br>
the tiring, boring, pain in the butt studying. Getting intelligence<br>
amplification and instant access to databases, even small databases,<br>
makes a person much quicker on the draw than a Renaissance period genius<br>
in the Vatican Library. Most people don't want or need, or can conceive<br>
of a need for, at this point, access to ALL knowledge. THey want to be<br>
able to process that small subset they do care about and need in a much<br>
faster, less tiring manner. People don't want to be wise, they want to<br>
be 'smart'. Therein lies the difference.<br>
