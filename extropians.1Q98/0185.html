Hi,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am not sure if it makes much sense to think of extropianism as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; movement, given the forms it seems to exhibit most characteristically over</i><br>
<i>&gt; the five years or so I've been looking it over.  More like a constellation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of spaces in which a group of people discuss certain idiosyncratic</i><br>
<i>&gt; preoccupations (most of which I share).  Usually stimulating, often</i><br>
<i>&gt; useful, sometimes deeply pleasurable, but a *movement*?</i><br>
<p>
I would describe it as a "memetic attractor" to use one of the neologisms I<br>
have come across on the net which best describes my feelings on the<br>
subject.<br>
<p>
I would suggest that those who are prepared for the ideas summed up as<br>
"extropianism" will become involved, and those who don't really shouldn't<br>
be pushed or even guided. I think spreading the meme is a good idea, but<br>
active proselytising would not be so good.<br>
<p>
I tend to be slightly elitist in such cases because I honestly feel that<br>
only a certain subset of the human race will "get it" and widespread<br>
publicity will not help some people "get it" more or faster, it will merely<br>
make the ideas -potentially available- to more people.<br>
