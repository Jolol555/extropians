Reilly Jones wrote a rather detailed denoument of selected comments he wished<br>
to take exception with, including my own:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Michael Lorrey wrote 3/6/98: &lt;The Declaration of Independence states that</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'men are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among</i><br>
<i>&gt; these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.  Whether you regard</i><br>
<i>&gt; your 'creator' as god, nature, or merely your parents (which one?) seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be irrelevant, but the D of I is not looked upon by the Supreme Court in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same manner as the USC.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The D of I is America's Articles of Incorporation, the Constitution is</i><br>
<i>&gt; merely its By-Laws.  The By-Laws have no meaning without organic reference</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the Articles of Incorporation.  When the Supreme Court makes decisions</i><br>
<i>&gt; that are cut free from the D of I, it is acting as a law unto itself with</i><br>
<i>&gt; no legitimacy at all, simply brute force *if* it can get the executive and</i><br>
<i>&gt; legislative branches to acquiesce.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, the Declaration of Independece is more of a Divorce Writ, not a marriage<br>
license. It defined why we no longer were members of the British Empire. It<br>
made no mention of the United States of America (indeed, for that political<br>
entity was not to exist for another 16+ years thereafter, and was actually a<br>
succeeding organization to the Congress under the Articles of Confederation.),<br>
so it has very little in relation to the Constitution other than sharing the<br>
same author.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; ML: &lt;That the 'right to choose' is not mentioned is irrelevant, as it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; implied that it belongs to the people, unless they delegate it to the state</i><br>
<i>&gt; (which is where state laws can be used to outlaw abortion, and where Roe v.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wade was an improper decision, in that it presumed federal authority to</i><br>
<i>&gt; restrict state rights which the poeple had previously delegated to them).&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You are correct about it being an improper decision and why it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; improper.  You are incorrect that there is any 'right to choose to murder</i><br>
<i>&gt; an unborn child'.  Prior to Roe v. Wade, it was unthinkable.  Roe v. Wade</i><br>
<i>&gt; stepped in and redefined human in a most barbaric way for convenience's or</i><br>
<i>&gt; expediency's sake.  The Justices deemed consequence-free sex to be an</i><br>
<i>&gt; equivalent value to the freedom to murder the weak.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, you have repeatedly refused to point blank come up with any<br>
refutation of my statement that fetuses have no rights. You claim that "'right<br>
to choose to murder an unborn child', Prior to Roe vs. Wade, it was<br>
unthinkable". You are right that it was unthinkable, but not for the reason you<br>
specify. Fetuses were not considered 'unborn children' until recently, so of<br>
course what you said was unthought-of. Why? Because if they were considered<br>
unborn children, then we would have records of nations where citizenship was<br>
recognized as beginning at conception. I have challenged you to come up with<br>
jut ONE national entity which recognised citizenship, and the rights protecting<br>
the same, as beginning at conception. You have avoided this challenge<br>
repeatedly. Come up with one example or concede the point. Stop being a<br>
selective debater, sniping from the shadows. Step up and take the challenge.<br>
<p>
Since no such provision is given in our own Constitution, then you must concede<br>
that given the present Constitution, that fetuses have no rights in the USA,<br>
other than any State Constitutional guarrantees which may exist, on a state by<br>
state basis, as a result of state populations delegating their 'right to<br>
choose', or by passing State Constitutional Amendments recognising residency at<br>
conception. That no state has an Office of Conception Registration, so as to<br>
register the fetal conceptions in that jurisdiction, indicates that no state<br>
has yet recognised fetal rights as a matter of residency.<br>
