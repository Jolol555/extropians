<p>
Really? Think about all of the really resonant messages out there, like "Visualize<br>
World Peace" (and was satirized by "Visualize Whirled Peas").  Bumper stickers are<br>
actually very good meme spreaders, since people's memory is reinforced when the<br>
person has a high adrenaline level, and when the average person is driving, they<br>
have elevated adrenaline levels, especially in traffic jams, you have a high<br>
adrenaline, capitve audience with nothing to do but look at the message on the<br>
bumper of your car.<br>
<p>
Or when you are at the beach, and some sexy girl/woman has a t-shirt on with a<br>
message, you are gonna be reading that message, even subliminally, while in a<br>
turned on state of mind. Its all a matter of advertizing psychology.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; &gt;I am always wearing my PETA baseball hat, (PETA</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in my case stands for :"People Eating Tasty Animals") and I get lots of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;feedback from people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't understand this message.  It sounds like a humorous T-shirt, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; what is the message?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The message is that by satirizing the PETA name (WHich stands for, if you are<br>
living in a hole, "People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals") in such a contrary<br>
manner, I am a) showing total contempt for the real PETA group's message, and b) in<br>
entertaining people with this satire, I am planting a counter-PETA meme that<br>
celebrates the carnivorous lifestyle, and humanity's position as the top predator<br>
on this planet.<br>
<p>
Think about beer commercials, for example. Just because they put these things on TV<br>
that place lots of sexy women in close and enjoyable proximity to Brand X, you get<br>
millions of guys out there going to bars to drink really bad beer, and thinking<br>
that they are a) enjoying themselves, and b) going to get laid.<br>
<p>
Most of us think we are above such crap, but we are fooling ourselves. Unless we<br>
are living the lifestyle of Ted Kazynski, we are all the prey of advertizing every<br>
day. We all buy brand names at least a few times more often than we would have<br>
without that subliminal implanting. We need to recognize this, and use it to our<br>
advantage.<br>
