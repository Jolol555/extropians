Is modern technology out of control?  If, by "control", you mean that<br>
someone or some group of people can dictate exactly how it develops,<br>
then, yes, it is out of control.  But in a more subtle sense, it *is* in<br>
control.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the perspective of your neurons or even groups of neruons (if they</i><br>
even have a perspective), you are out of control.  None of your neurons<br>
control you or *can* control you; they are too small in the overall<br>
process of you to exert much control.  Yet, your overall behavior comes<br>
out reasonably intelligent, with no one really in charge of the system.  <br>
<p>
The whole system of technology seems reasonably intelligent (which is not<br>
surprising, since the participants in the system all make reasonably<br>
intelligent decisions), but the *whole* system isn't under any direct<br>
control by anyone or any group; everyone has their own little part of the<br>
system to manage, and because everyone is managing their own part<br>
intelligently, the whole system of modern technology is fairly<br>
intelligent.  No *one* is in charge because *everyone* is in charge, to a<br>
small degree.<br>
<p>
Modern technology is under -distributed control-, not centralized<br>
control.  Which is a very good thing, since a powerful, centralized<br>
authority is capable of making much more devastating errors than any one<br>
of the millions of distributed entities, who have far less power.  Spread<br>
the power and control around to as many as possible, and it is difficult<br>
for anyone to make too big of a mistake.  If everyone's keeping an eye on<br>
their own part of things, then everything's being watched over. <br>
Distributed control is the safest form of control that modern technology<br>
could have.  We are in our own hands; not in the hands of any leader. <br>
That makes some uncomfortable because they like prominant leaders, but it<br>
makes me feel very safe, because I trust my fellow humans to make good<br>
choices, in general, and to keep an eye out for dangerous people.<br>
