<p>
Ouch, I thought I was retro since I read my mail in Emacs, but I stand<br>
corrected... :-)<br>

Mike has pointed out a real problem: the current email standard *is*<br>
old and locked in - we will likely have to deal with it for a long<br>
time. Remember that Ascii is still buried in the bottom of Unicode -<br>
somehow I think Vinge was right on the mark with his description of a<br>
galactic Usenet with headers fairly similar to ours; ancient, basic<br>
standards that everybody use but always try to circumvent.<br>
<p>
It would be very nice with a better email standard, but such a move<br>
should not be undertaken lightly. Besides not wanting to isolate those<br>
who use older systems (an extremely simple standard can also be dealt<br>
with by almost any system) there is also the issue of what new<br>
features we need - typographic control is nice, but hardly the most<br>
essential stuff. And even if you have a good idea for a standard you<br>
will have to make it a standard, and that is obviously tricky<br>
(remember MIME?).<br>
