<p>
I had a similar thought the other day.<br>
<p>
I started out with the following idea. Suppose we construct probes <br>
that fly out in all directions, and when they reach a lump of matter, <br>
they use some of the energy it contains to shoot fragments back to <br>
origo (Earth). Some fragments have to fly in the opposite direction <br>
to conserve total  momentum, but there should be a constant fraction <br>
of the energy in a lump of matter that we can send back to origo at a <br>
certain speed.<br>
<p>
As the colonization wave spreads, the frontier surface that they <br>
harvest matter from increases as the square of the radius of the <br>
colonization bubble. My idea was that even if the average density of <br>
the universe decreases over time as a result of expansion, this <br>
decrease might slow enough so that amount of matter that <br>
could be sent back to origo at any moment would diverge as t goes to <br>
infinity. This could allow an infinity of computations at origo.<br>
<p>
I did some back of the envelope calculations. I think the expansion <br>
rate of the universe (if it is open) will asymptotically approach a <br>
constant (could anybody confirm this?). So the density of the <br>
universe would decrease as t^3, for large values of t, and the volume <br>
from of the space where we can have harvested a constant fraction of <br>
its matter content grows as t^3 (if the probes have constant speed <br>
ans since the volume of a sphere is proportional to R^3). So far, <br>
things look bright.<br>
<p>
But then I thought of this problem. Suppose the probes travel with <br>
the speed v. Then there must be some distance d such that if the <br>
probes start at that distance, they will never return to origo. For <br>
if d is big enough, then by the time the probes have traveled 10% of <br>
the way, the remaining 90% will have grown larger than the original <br>
100%, due to the expansion of space inbetween. So if that expansion <br>
rate settles down to a constant, then there must be a sphere centered <br>
around Earth such that nothing that is outside of that sphere can <br>
*ever* affect Earth, even if it travels with the speed of light. <br>
Hence the above proposal fails, unless somebody can point to some <br>
mistake in this reasoning.<br>
