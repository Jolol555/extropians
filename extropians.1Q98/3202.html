My company makes data communicatons switches. We've been in business for 12<br>
years, and we acquired another company which has been in business even longer.<br>
We now have three ongoing product lines and ten or more "mature" product lines<br>
which are still being used by customers but which are no longer being marketed.<br>
There are probably a thousand companies in a similar situation.<br>
<p>
We are characterizing all our products' Y2K behaviour. For mature products, we<br>
will<br>
tell the customers what to expect. For ongoing products, we have already<br>
verified that the latest releases are fully Y2K compliant. In general, our<br>
products are in good shape, except for some products that are based<br>
workstations or PCs. We use UNIX workstations or our network management system.<br>
The oldest supported workstations are Apollos. The workstation manufacturer<br>
doesn't commit to Y2K compliance in the OS.<br>
Some of our switches are based on PCs. Because of the very high rate of<br>
progress in the PC industry, we basically used a new motherboard and BIOS every<br>
year. Guess what? the clock/calendar primitives for a PC are in the BIOS and<br>
depend on clock chips on the motherboard. This means we've shipped product with<br>
ten or so different motherboard configs, and we've had to characterize them<br>
all. The new ones are Y2K compliant. The older ones are not, and will give<br>
confused dates and times after midnight, 1 Jan, 2000. Most of them will work<br>
just fine if they are re-booted after that time. Customers using the<br>
non-compliant PCs must either upgrade or must be willing to take the equipment<br>
out of service for a minute or two at the proper time.<br>
