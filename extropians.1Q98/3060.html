<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been thinking a _lot_ about this since I joined this list last august</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I'll try to explain my viewpoint as it is now. Philosophically speaking</i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't justify forced income redistribution by a state (even a democratic</i><br>
<i>&gt; one).</i><br>
<p>
My, my, the heart titters.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If the state can't redistribute income, the state can't exist, it needs</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources to provide the kind of high-level services single individuals</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't buy and most companies can't provide (see my example below).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Redistributing income is much more than welfare, tax-funded security</i><br>
<i>&gt; (police) is also a kind of income-redistribution, the rich paying for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; security of the poor to some extend. So, if I'm not mistaken, you're saying</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you want no governement whatsoever.</i><br>
<p>
No government whatsoever is a good idea, but in the meantime, we need to try to<br>
make the burden of government more efficient and businesslike, heavily downsizing<br>
a hugely swollen workforce. However, you are wrong in considering normal business<br>
functions of government as income redistribution. If the government buys a bomber<br>
or builds a dike, I am receiving a service for the portion of my tax that pays<br>
for those items, therefore, it is an acceptable business exchange.<br>
<p>
If my tax money goes into the government coffers, then straight back out as a<br>
cash disbursement to a high school dropout with a drug habit and three kids, that<br>
is income redistribution, as I get no service or product in return for that part<br>
of my taxes. This might not be so bad if the government did not deny the same<br>
benefits to me in the event that I found myself in dire financial straights,<br>
however, I have tried this in the past when I was unemployed and the government<br>
always found a loophole to deny any benefits to me, a single, white, straight,<br>
sober, able bodied male with no dependents.<br>
<p>
Since I have found no hope of ever being eligible to collect on the 'unemployment<br>
insurance' which is paid in my wages (if I were still a full time employee,<br>
instead of a contractor as I am now), I have gone the contractor route, and I<br>
should have the legal right to discount from my taxes that portion which pays for<br>
benefits for which I have no hope of ever receiving, or for theose services,<br>
products or benefits for which I choose not to receive.<br>
<p>
Notice I mentioned CHOICE. Of course, if I lived in a flood plain, I would<br>
obviously have to be asessed fees for the construction and maintenance of the<br>
flood protection system, as merely an insurance policy, but conversely, I should<br>
get a guarrantee of reimbursement for damages in the event that the flood<br>
protection system fails. Currently the government only does this if the state<br>
Governor asks the President to declare a disaster area. If you are not in a<br>
declared area, then the government system doesn't owe you anything, which stinks.<br>
<p>
Any government program which spends citizens moneys should be proven to be a<br>
strict common good that cannot be avoided (like flood protection in a flood<br>
plain), rather than either 'bread and circuses' to keep large special interest<br>
groups at bay (read: the poverty stricken barbarians), or programs which would<br>
force someone to pay for a program for which they do not, have not, and never<br>
will enjoy any measurable benefit. Forcing someone on a mountaintop to pay for<br>
flood insurance is insanity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; OK.</i><br>
<i>&gt; To this I can only say that AFAIKT absence of some kind of governing body leads</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a very unconstructive chaos that makes it very hard for people to actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; do what they're good at. Instead they are kept busy with personal security and</i><br>
<i>&gt; ensuring all kinds of other basics that we can take for granted.</i><br>
<p>
If you think that the government is responsible for protecting your personal<br>
security, you are severely misinformed. Police are only there to catch the bad<br>
guy AFTER he has robbed, raped or killed you, not to prevent it from happening.<br>
<p>
That most people get through life totally ignoring their currently existing<br>
responsibility to protect themselves is testament to the fact that there are<br>
enough people out there who do that criminals are increasingly weary of commiting<br>
crimes, given that the large decrease in crimes in the US in the past couple of<br>
years  is almost entirely found in states which have liberalized their<br>
right-to-carry laws to the point that it is rather easy for law abiding citizens<br>
to carry concealed weapons. New Hampshire, which has one of the highest per<br>
capita gun populations in the entire world, has a lower crime rate than any<br>
country its size or larger in europe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'll be the first to aknowledge that states themselves have done some</i><br>
<i>&gt; pretty bad things throughout history but I can also give some examples</i><br>
<i>&gt; where people seem to be reasonably happy with their state. Democratic</i><br>
<i>&gt; representation and a 'trias politica' seem to be the lesser evil (IMHO). I</i><br>
<i>&gt; know of no example where stateless situations have lead to stable,</i><br>
<i>&gt; high-tech, prosperous communities (but am willing to listen to interesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; examples).</i><br>
<p>
New Hampshire, which has open borders with three other US states (one of which<br>
has one of the highest crime rates in the US, btw) and a reasonably open one with<br>
Canada, has one of the lowest crime rates in the US, has the second lowest tax<br>
burden per capita of any state in the US,(the US having the lowest per capita tax<br>
burden in the industrialized world). It also has one of the top public<br>
universities (UNH) and private universities (Dartmouth College) in the US. With<br>
no active duty military bases (it has a well staffed National Guard and Air<br>
National Guard). We have among the highest scholastic acheivement rates of any<br>
state in the Union, have always had an average SAT score in the top 5 states<br>
(concurrently with being among the lowest 5 states in terms of per capita<br>
education expenditures, go figure). NH is rated as having one of the best<br>
business climates in the US. My hometown, Lebanon, was rated two years ago as<br>
being the 2nd most livable small town in the US (in our snooty neighboring town,<br>
Hanover, where Dartmouth is located, people were noted as saying "we always knew<br>
you were second best" ;) )<br>
<p>
Best of all, we also have the lowest unemployment rate in the US, at less than<br>
2%.<br>
<p>
Our state legislature is one of the largest in the world, and they are all<br>
volunteers. They are only paid gas money.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course it can be argued that untill now the conditions have always been</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong for an anarcho-capitalistic society to succed but this is pretty much</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same arguments that hard-line communists use when they defend their</i><br>
<i>&gt; system: "No, no, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot weren't true communists, but when</i><br>
<i>&gt; we take power things will be different." We've had a whole bunch of</i><br>
<i>&gt; large-scale social experiments this century and almost everyone some form</i><br>
<i>&gt; og genocide occured.</i><br>
<p>
large scale social experiments have proven to not work. The key is small steps to<br>
try out, one at a time to see if it works or not, and slowly enough that most<br>
people won't notice (many US socialists in power positions now utilize this<br>
practice, especially in the gun control arena).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Structural changes to a complex system as society should be done gently and</i><br>
<i>&gt; _very_ carefully. A system-crash can (and has) cost millions of lives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll try to give an example of problem I think only a state-like</i><br>
<i>&gt; organisation can solve (it's a bit nationalistic but bear with me ;-).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In 1953 a large part of Holland was flooded when a combination of</i><br>
<i>&gt; high-tides and storm occured. The dike system protecting</i><br>
<i>&gt; lower-than-sea-level land was breached and about 2000 people drowned. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; response to this the Dutch governement implemented the Delta-plan. Over a</i><br>
<i>&gt; perion of 33 years over a $10^12 was invested in upgrading all dike-systems so</i><br>
<i>&gt; that an occurrance like the '53 flood could never occur again. The final</i><br>
<i>&gt; construction was finished last year, two giant doors that can close a canal's</i><br>
<i>&gt; opening into the sea.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've been trying to think how a commercial organisation could have achieved</i><br>
<i>&gt; such a thing. Who would invest in such a project? Who would 'buy' the end</i><br>
<i>&gt; product? I believe that only a state has the means and the organisation to pull</i><br>
<i>&gt; something like that off.</i><br>
<p>
I don't imagine that the Dutch Government was the contractor that did the work,<br>
was it? Since most of your country is in a flood plain (partly man-made), it is<br>
obvious that your country is essentially what is known as a "planned community".<br>
Its a rather large one, granted, such that it has attained sovereign status as an<br>
independent nation, but it, at its heart, is a planned community, much like<br>
smaller 'gated communities' that are springing up all over the US here. Its<br>
obvious that for one to become or remain a resident of such a community, the<br>
developers of the community are right in imposing asessments on residents, for<br>
the cost of maintaining the community, as well as the historical capital costs.<br>
<p>
There is a similar planned community not far from my home here in NH. It is<br>
called Eastman, and covers most of Grafton township, as well as parts of Enfield,<br>
Canaan, Sunapee, and New London. A private company bought all of the property<br>
back in the late 60's, built roads, water and sewer lines, electric and phone<br>
lines, built a combined alpine and nordic ski area, olympic pool, 18 hole golf<br>
course, and plotted out all of the lots. There are over 10,000 homes in this<br>
development. Owners are assesed annual fees by the Corporation, in which they are<br>
stockholders, for the maintenance of their property as well as for maintenance<br>
and operation of the community facilities. People have a choice of whether or not<br>
they wish to live in this community.<br>
<p>
Conversely, hardly anyone on earth has the ability to choose what country to be a<br>
citizen of, and those who would prefer to not support the unproductive elements<br>
of society have no developed nation to which to emigrate to. Thus there is a<br>
distinct lack of choice in the matter of permitting a libertarian to decide what<br>
larger community to which they wish to be a member.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Can anyone think of a scenario where companies would have made something like</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Internet? (a free-to-use-for-all utility).</i><br>
<p>
Outside of ARPAnet, the entire internet here in the US does happen to have been<br>
built independently by corporations. It has the largest bandwidth and redundancy<br>
of any part of the internet in the world. It also has the largest growth and<br>
commercial business transactions being conducted of any nation. This was not done<br>
with government money.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't like the fact that a state is needed so that people can live</i><br>
<i>&gt; together but for now I firmly believe it is the lesser evil.</i><br>
<p>
Give every man and woman a pistol and the training to use it, and not only will<br>
people live peacefully together, but they will be a lot more polite and freindly<br>
about it. Gun use promotes the meme of self-reliance (which is of course the bane<br>
of any socialist dogma).<br>
