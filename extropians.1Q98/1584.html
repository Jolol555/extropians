I sent my pop sci book on the singularity, THE SPIKE - published in<br>
Australia about 6 months ago - to a well-disposed US publisher, who<br>
declined it for the following rather interesting reason (which suggests a<br>
more drastic sense of accelerating change than anything we assume on this<br>
list, he mutters sardonically):<br>
<p>
====================<br>
<p>
    <br>
     ... the editor ...<br>
     considered it, but feels that, given the pace at which the technology <br>
     is racing, the book would most likely be outdated by the time we were <br>
     able to get it out <br>
  <br>
======================<br>
<p>
I replied:<br>
<p>
<p>
I have to say that I'm *flabbergasted* by this reason for declining the<br>
book.  I can only assume that the editor read only the first few dozen<br>
pages, which drew for effect upon the latest news at the time and can<br>
easily be updated.  Since the bulk of the book is about the truly<br>
mind-boggling possibilities that won't kick in until about 2030, it simply<br>
*can't* get outdated (unless extraterrestrials arrive, or time travel is<br>
announced).  The topics I emphasise are the social impact of mature<br>
nanotechnology, AI and uploading.<br>
<p>
That is, THE SPIKE *isn't* a book about the wonders of the Pentium chip and<br>
its immediate successor, but about what happens when (for example) the<br>
entire ecosystem gets suffused with almost invisible `nano Utility-fog', or<br>
people begin to port their consciousness into nanocomputers.  I haven't<br>
noticed any uploaded posthumans running on nanotechnology in a Dyson sphere<br>
on my street lately.  I don't expect this to occur between now and<br>
publication date.  <br>
