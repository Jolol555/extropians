An old idea for mechanizing creativity is to divide it into two parts:<br>
one is an exploratory part, which is highly random and throws out a lot<br>
of "crazy ideas".  In the visual arts, maybe it tries lots of different<br>
combinations of colors and shapes.  The other part is the judgement part,<br>
which looks at the output of the first part and decides what looks good.<br>
In some models this could then feed back and narrow the search space of<br>
the first part.<br>
<p>
To say that computers can't mechanize creativity, you either have to say<br>
that this method won't work to produce creative artworks, or else that<br>
computers can't do the first or second parts.  The most questionable is<br>
probably whether computers can ever be able to have esthetic judgement,<br>
to be able to look at different artworks and say which ones people will<br>
find attractive.<br>
<p>
It's not clear when this will be possible, but making a computer a critic<br>
sounds easier than making it an artist.  Actually the two are not as<br>
different as they seem.<br>
