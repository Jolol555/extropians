<i>&gt; The problem I see with this notion of metaorganism and their rights</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that it winds up being in practice, the "right" of the leaders of</i><br>
<i>&gt; existing institutions to impose their will on other people.  Thus, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think the case for metaorganisms has not been truly made.  It is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; analogy which is easily abused, and the abuse of it plays into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; hands of existing and would be elites.</i><br>
<p>
A leader-centered metaorganism is in some sense a huge exoself that<br>
extends the leader and could be considered a transhuman technology if<br>
it didn't involve the use of less-than-free humans as<br>
components. Imagine having something equivalent to a major corporation<br>
as an integral part of yourself, implementing your will and augmenting<br>
your capabilities!<br>
<p>
However, many organisations are not strongly under control of their<br>
human leaders, but are more of a collective system. Usually they do<br>
not become collective systems independent of leaders immediately, but<br>
slowly grow in this direction as they age. I would say "true"<br>
metaorganisms that have their own behavior independent of humans today<br>
tend to be very old and large, and it might be that they have not yet<br>
fully emerged.<br>
