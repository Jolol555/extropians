Julian Simon, a University of Maryland business professor who died on<br>
Feb. 8, was an indefatigable optimist. In his books, "The State of<br>
Humanity" and "The State of Humanity 2," he marshaled mountains of<br>
statistics to buttress his argument that the lives of most people in<br>
the world are improving and will continue to improve. The following<br>
essay, summarizing his most recent work, is adapted from a piece he<br>
submitted to Outlook shortly before his death.<br>
<p>
*********************<br>
<p>
Look around when you are next in a theater, a mall, classroom or<br>
religious service. (I happened to be in a church celebrating a wedding<br>
as this thought entered my mind.) Note the well-dressed man who might<br>
be an engineer, the neatly groomed woman who might be a business<br>
executive, the casually dressed service worker and other middle-class<br>
attendees. Reflect that 200 years ago or less, the ancestors of 19 out<br>
of every 20 people you see today were living at or just above<br>
subsistence level somewhere in the world: grubbers in the soil<br>
or perhaps village smiths or shoemakers. Virtually all of their<br>
ancestors were people that the tiny middle and upper classes thought<br>
of as loutish and dull peasants whose lot in life -- "nasty, brutish<br>
and short" in Thomas Hobbes's famous phrase -- would not greatly<br>
improve before their deaths (though they surely celebrated weddings<br>
with the same fervor and joy that we do). And the situation was pretty<br>
much the same for every generation before them, going back 2,000 or<br>
20,000 years.<br>
<p>
"The farther back you look," Winston Churchill is reputed to have said,<br>
"the further ahead you can see." When we look very far back, we see<br>
clearly that the long-term prospects for the standard of living of all<br>
humanity are spectacularly good. The progress that humanity has<br>
experienced in the last two centuries has no precedent. Since 1750,<br>
every trend in material human welfare has shown accelerating<br>
improvement, almost everywhere. It is our happy fate to live in the<br>
midst of this most amazing time.<br>
<p>
These trends do not mean that people will be more or less "happy" about<br>
their own lives; about that I have no prediction. Nor am I ignoring<br>
contemporary social ills: mass graves in Bosnia, HIV epidemics, sexual<br>
exploitation of children and the like. These are sometimes cited as<br>
justification for long-range pessimism about the state of humanity.<br>
But over the last 200 years, pessimistic forecasts about human<br>
prospects based on anecdotes about social ills have been repudiated by<br>
the reality of material progress.<br>
<p>
The most mistaken forecast of all time was made by English economist<br>
Thomas Malthus in 1798 when he predicted in "An Essay on the Principle<br>
of Population" that population growth was an inexorable juggernaut that<br>
would keep the mass of mankind in misery forever. In fact, at the very<br>
time that Malthus wrote, the advanced countries of the world were<br>
taking off into the astonishing period of progress which continues to<br>
this day.<br>
<p>
To Malthus's credit, after his dismally wrong first edition based on<br>
nothing but arithmetic and speculation, he educated himself and<br>
reversed his original conclusions. Unfortunately, almost no one pays<br>
attention to the correction Malthus made in his own theory. Instead<br>
"Malthusian" has come into the language to describe what Malthus wrote<br>
while still in a state of scientific ignorance.<br>
<p>
The claims of modern-day Malthusians notwithstanding, mankind's<br>
progress will continue indefinitely in the future. Barring catastrophic<br>
surprises in the first half of the 21st century, most of humanity will<br>
soon come to share the long healthy life that is now enjoyed by the<br>
middle-class contemporary residents of the advanced countries.<br>
<p>
Consider the history of life expectancy. Since the mid-18th century,<br>
the life expectancy of the average person in England has gone from the<br>
mid-thirties to close to almost 70 by 1985. In China, the average<br>
person in 1750 could expect to live to his or her late twenties; by<br>
1985, Chinese people were typically living into their sixties. Now,<br>
most of humanity enjoys better health and longevity than the richest<br>
people in the richest countries did just 100 years ago.<br>
<p>
The speed of the race against death has been breathtaking since the<br>
first miracle drug against infection was discovered. As Henry Sigerist<br>
wrote in "Civilization and Disease" in 1942, "Bacteria, our chief<br>
enemies once they were firmly entrenched in the body seemed resistant<br>
against chemicals -- until [Nobel Prize-winning bacteriologist] Gerhard<br>
Domagk discovered the action of the drug prontosil, later to be<br>
developed and known as sulfanilamide. This was ... only yesterday, and<br>
in the last few years dozens of highly effective sulfa drugs have been<br>
prepared."<br>
<p>
Progress in the fight against the AIDS virus in recent years is but the<br>
latest demonstration of the awesome intellectual power that humanity<br>
can now muster against threats to our well-being. This power results<br>
from tested theories accumulated during the past millennium and<br>
especially during the past two centuries. It also flows from our<br>
communal wealth. Much more than the power to enjoy gadgets, our wealth<br>
represents the power to mobilize nature to our advantage, rather than<br>
to just accept the random fates of nature.<br>
<p>
A personal example: I have mild asthma. I once slept in a home where<br>
there was a dog. In the middle of the night woke with a bad cough and<br>
shortness of breath. When I realized that it was caused by the dog<br>
hair, I took out my $12 pocket inhaler, good for 3,000 puffs, and took<br>
a couple. Within 10 minutes, my lungs were clear. A small miracle.<br>
Forty years ago, I would have been miserable all night.<br>
<p>
Or consider diabetes: If your child had diabetes 100 years ago, you had<br>
to watch helplessly as the child went blind and died early. Now<br>
injections, even pills, can give the child almost as long and healthy a<br>
life as other children.  And glasses: Centuries ago you had to give up<br>
reading when your eyesight got dim as you reached 40 or 50. Now you can<br>
buy simple glasses at the drugstore.  And you can even wear contact<br>
lenses for eye problems and keep your vanity intact.<br>
<p>
This is not just the good fortune of a few. The improvement in material<br>
human welfare in poor countries since World War II has been startling.<br>
Economist Richard Easterlin calculates that by 2050, the average income<br>
in the present-day Third-World's poor countries will be about 80<br>
percent of the average per capita U.S. income in 1990.<br>
This trend is based in part on improving food, nutrition and diet, the<br>
world over. Only a hundred years ago, meat was a rare luxury for most<br>
people.  Fresh vegetables were unavailable in Europe for much of the<br>
year, no matter how rich you were. Now Americans officially classified<br>
as living "in poverty" can purchase a much better diet than could<br>
European royalty a couple of centuries ago. After spending 100,000<br>
years trying to get enough calories, mankind is now trying to consume<br>
fewer.<br>
<p>
By any measure, natural resources have become more available rather<br>
than more scarce. Consider copper, which is representative of all the<br>
metals. The cost of a ton is only about a tenth of what it was 200<br>
years ago. There is evidence that oil -- the most worrisome of<br>
resources because it is mostly burned up and therefore cannot be<br>
recycled -- has actually been getting cheaper to produce.<br>
On the one hand, the falling price of oil throughout the 20th century<br>
was proof that the overall cost of obtaining oil had to be falling. But<br>
wells were being drilled deeper and deeper, which called into question<br>
whether the physical production costs were rising in some important<br>
parts of the industry.  But industry data, reported in Business Week,<br>
shows that the worldwide production cost per barrel has been falling<br>
since 1980. So not only is more oil being found but it is getting<br>
cheaper, and not more expensive, to find it.<br>
<p>
How are we to understand the trends of the past and their implications<br>
for the future?<br>
<p>
A theory that fits the facts: More people and increased income cause<br>
problems of increased scarcity of resources in the short run.<br>
Heightened scarcity causes prices to rise. The higher prices present<br>
opportunity, and prompt inventors and entrepreneurs to search for<br>
solutions. Many fail, at cost to themselves. But, in a free society,<br>
solutions are eventually found. And in the long run, the new<br>
developments leave us better off than if the problems had<br>
not arisen. That is, prices end up lower than before the increased<br>
scarcity occurred.<br>
<p>
The record of humanity shows that, on average, the people in each<br>
generation create a bit more than they use up. Not only must this be<br>
true to account for the increase in our wealth and numbers, but if this<br>
were not so -- if we used up a bit more than we create, and our assets<br>
deteriorated like a many-times-patched tire deteriorates until it is no<br>
longer useful -- we simply would have become extinct as a species. The<br>
essential condition of fitness for survival of our species is that each<br>
generation creates a net surplus on average, or at least breaks even.<br>
Since we have survived and increased, this condition must<br>
have been present.<br>
<p>
The question then immediately arises: Must not we, like other species,<br>
cease our growth when we have filled up our niche -- that is, reached<br>
the limit of the available resources? One cannot answer this question<br>
with assurance, of course, because with each increase of wealth and<br>
numbers, we proceed into a situation with which which we have no prior<br>
experience.<br>
<p>
But as can be seen in the evidence of the increasing availability of<br>
natural resources throughout history as measured by their declining<br>
prices --especially food, metals and energy -- there apparently is no<br>
fixed limit on our resources in the future. There are limits at any<br>
moment, but the limits continually expand, and constrain us less with<br>
each passing generation. In this, we are quite unlike all other<br>
 animals.<br>
<p>
The doubters wonder whether our present glorious age is just another<br>
blip in history, like the Egyptian, Persian and Roman empires and the<br>
Golden Age of Greece. The doubters ask why we should believe that the<br>
progress we have experienced since 1750 is an irreversible<br>
breakthrough. They suggest that we simply may be living through an<br>
episode of glory that will soon be eclipsed, as were previous Roman,<br>
Greek and Chinese civilizations.<br>
<p>
The first reason is that ours is the first age in which material gains<br>
have been enjoyed by more than a tiny fraction of humanity -- 5 percent<br>
or 10 percent of the population -- while the rest remained at mere<br>
subsistence levels. Never before has material progress ever spread<br>
beyond the richest people.<br>
<p>
Second, every measure of human material welfare has shown a dramatic<br>
upturn, not only life expectancy and mortality, but also<br>
transportation, communications, nutrition, leisure time, you name it.<br>
Every measure shows change, the first time in human history this has<br>
happened.<br>
<p>
A third reason is that our stock of knowledge is widely distributed. In<br>
ancient times, the destruction of the library in Alexandria, Egypt was<br>
 a huge setback to civilization. The decentralization of knowledge<br>
makes that kind of catastrophe almost impossible today.<br>
<p>
And last, the concept of evolution argues that -- in the absence of<br>
huge change in the physical world from climate change or planetary<br>
collision -- humanity will continue to go forward. We ride the greatest<br>
trend of all: to leave the world a little better than we entered it.<br>
This is the strongest reason to believe that humanity will not retreat<br>
to the Stone Age or to extinction the way other civilizations have<br>
done.<br>
