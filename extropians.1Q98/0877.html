      "Why Government?" -- a perennial question...<br>
<p>
      Peter Marshall's fine book "Demanding the Impossible" on all the <br>
various kinds of Anarchism, and Movement histories, is a fine <br>
starting-point. And -- yes! -- there's a chapter on anarcho-capitalism too <br>
(which Noam Chomsky -- also an anarchist -- characterises as 'liable to <br>
lead to the most hideous tyranny the world has ever seen').<br>
<p>
      Then ask a crucial question: "Do we ever get out of anarchy?"  Just <br>
because some people characterize themselves as 'State Officials' doesn't <br>
mean we have to recognize them as fundamentally different types of beings.<br>
The social universe in a world of individual actors acting in different <br>
ways at different times.  What matters is the character of acts.<br>
<p>
      If we characterize 'Government' as the unilateral exercise of <br>
coercion, we get a clearer picture of what it is about it that we really <br>
dislike: and the question is subtly altered into "How do we minimize the <br>
unilateral exercise of coercion?"<br>
<p>
      Landlords charge rent: States charge taxes.  Most states let you <br>
leave, most of the time.  Most landlords ditto.  I had the following <br>
argument with David Ramsay Steele, an anarcho-capitalist theoretician.  <br>
Agorism and anarcho-capitalism are fundamentally different ideas, so we <br>
argued a lot...  He attacked me and threatened to kill me once or twice.<br>
<p>
      It seems to me, I said playfully, that any crafty group of <br>
capitalist could replicate the evils of government in a pre-existing <br>
anarcho-capitalist society by focusing their resources on buying a key <br>
resource, then imposing conditions of use on it:  i.e. fervent Islamic <br>
capitalists could buy the roads, then make adherence to Islam a condition <br>
of use for all the customers. They aren't interested in selling the roads <br>
again, remember, nor do they care about maximizing their _financial_ <br>
return on capital.<br>
<p>
      So how would we address this problem?<br>
<p>
      David Ramsay Steele just shrugged this off by saying "We would have <br>
a revolution, and reassign the property rights."   Oh, right...<br>
<p>
<p>
  So it seemed a better bet to me, to focus on answering these questions:<br>
       <br>
 [A] How do we maximize negative liberties for all?  Freedom from restraint.<br>
<p>
 [B] How to we maximize positive liberties for all?  Freedom-to-do. Means.<br>
<p>
 [C] How do we minimize the incidence of coercion in society?<br>
       <br>
<p>
     This is Karl Popper's programme too.<br>
     <br>
     "Another, more familiar paradox, first implicitly frmulated by Plato, <br>
     is the paradox of freedom.  Unqualified freedom, like unqualified <br>
     tolerance, is not only self-destructive, but bound to produce its <br>
     opposite - for if all restraints were removed there would be nothing <br>
     to stop the strong enslaving the weak (or meek).  So complete freedom <br>
     would bring about the end of freedom, and therefore proponents of <br>
     complete freedom are in actuality, whatever their intentions, enemies <br>
     of freedom.  Popper points particularly to the paradox of economic <br>
     freedom, which makes possible the unrestrained exploitation of the <br>
     poor by the rich, and results in the almost complete loss of economic <br>
     freedom by the poor.  Here again, there 'must be a _political_ remedy <br>
     -- a remedy similar to the one we use against physical violence.  We <br>
     must construct social institutions, enforced by the power of the <br>
     state, for the protection of the economically weak from the <br>
     economically strong....  This means that the idea of <br>
     non-intervention, of an unrestrained economic system, has to be given <br>
     up; if we wish freedom to be safeguarded, then we must demand that <br>
     the policy of unlimited economic freedom must be replaced...'     <br>
      <br>
     In all these cases, the maximum possible tolerance or freedom is an <br>
     optimum, not an absolute, for it has to be restricted if it is to <br>
     exist at all.  The government intervention which alone can guarantee <br>
     it is a dangerous weapon: without it, or wit too little, freedom <br>
     dies; but with too much of it, freedom dies also.  We are brought <br>
     back by the inescapability of control -- which must mean, if it is to <br>
     be effective, removeability -- of government by the governed as the <br>
     _sine qua non_ of democracy.  This however, though necessary, is not <br>
     sufficient.  It does not guarantee the preservation of freedom, for <br>
     nothing can:  the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.  As Popper <br>
     has remarked, institutions are like fortresses in that althogh to be <br>
     effective, they have to be properly constructed this alone will not <br>
     make them work:  they have also to be properly manned....'<br>
     <br>
     The vital question is not 'Who should rule?' but 'How can we minimize <br>
     misrule -- both the likelihood of its occurring and, when it does <br>
     occur, its consequences?'" -- Bryan Magee, 'Popper' [1982].<br>
