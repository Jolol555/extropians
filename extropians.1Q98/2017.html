I think that the main reason why we would like our own country isn't just to<br>
have someplace to get away to, but to be able to travel the world as citizens<br>
of a country we can actually beleive in, which does not make so many of the<br>
things we would like to do illegal, and which does not confiscate such a<br>
large percentage of our productive capacity to no measurable benefit. Another<br>
point is to be from a country that isn't hated by so many people. While the<br>
US has fairly high positive ratings from people in other countries, more so<br>
than most, it also has high negative ratings, meaning that people in other<br>
countries tend to be 'firm' in their opinions of the US and Americans.<br>
<p>
Still another is to be able to go through your life without having to carry a<br>
wallet full of identification just to make it through an average day<br>
(paraphrasing Robert Heinlein's standard of a rotten society). Another<br>
standard that our society currently fails is that one feels as though you<br>
need body armor to get through the day, but are not allowed to carry that or<br>
anything else you might defend yourself with.  To quote Christian Slater,"<br>
Its better to have a gun and not need it, than to need a gun and not have<br>
it."<br>
<p>
Working for the company I currently consult for, I have gained a much greater<br>
understanding of the amount of personal information that many companies have<br>
on each and every person who participates in our consumer economy. I'll bet<br>
that if I wanted to, I could in one hour or less, find out a significant<br>
amount of information about any American on this list, that you would<br>
normally consider to be highly private information. Probably at least some<br>
information you would normally think it would be illegal for me to gain<br>
access to.  This is the sort of big brother society that has been warned of,<br>
but everybody is so absorbed in their own consumer satisfaction that they<br>
have no idea of how much of their privacy they have given up.<br>
<p>
For example, my mother and sister have at times used the services of Weight<br>
Watchers, and purchased dietary aids. Two of my company's customers, that are<br>
in the mail order business, which both sell clothing for large women,<br>
recently added my mother and sister to their mailing lists. Since I am on a<br>
first name basis with the system administrator at one of these companies, I<br>
asked him how they could get both of them on their mailing list. He said that<br>
they get information from retail drug store chains and from Weight Watchers,<br>
which they cross reference to figure out who the overweight people are. They<br>
also sell this information to the other mail order company.<br>
