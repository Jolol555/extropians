potential need of a secure base for research and development beyond the<br>

of current nation states who may attempt to ban key technologies.  IF<br>
(and<br>
it's a big "if") an offshore base were crucial for such work, then<br>
development<br>
of a terrestrial extra-national enclave could be important.  This would<br>
obviously be important only in a very brief transitional period, as<br>
getting<br>
such efforts off-planet would be a much, much safer course of action:<br>

factors that made submarines important strategic technology in the 20th<br>
century will make spacecraft much more so in the next.<br>

I think this, along with the need for new frontiers, will be the primary <br>
motivation for human space colonization in the next few decades. Robotic<br>
facilities can only do so much, certainly not conduct high tech lab<br>
research. A mass of under 100 US tons launched from Earth seems to be <br>
enough to establish a self-replicating colony using current tech, <br>
including provisions for biological life. A private venture, using one<br>
of <br>
the new breeed of commercial launchers, might be able to put this<br>
together <br>
for a few G$. The people that move to this place (Moon, Mars, Asteroid) <br>
can still access current science on Earth via radio, while living in a<br>
very <br>
defensible high ground.<br>
