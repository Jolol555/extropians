Wei Dai, &lt;weidai@eskimo.com&gt;, writes:<br>
<i>&gt; Which hypothesis is simpler, that the parameters of this universe are</i><br>

<i>&gt; the parameters of this universe?"</i><br>
<p>
This is a very promising approach but I would look at it a bit differently.<br>
<p>
First, it seems that there are really two questions here.  The first is<br>
why the parameters of the universe are what we observe.  Theoretically<br>
we can measure the actual values of the parameters to extremely high<br>
(arbitrary?) precision as technology advances.  Hence the information<br>
content in these parameters may turn out to be very high.<br>
<p>
The second question is why these parameters happened to fall into the<br>
range that would allow the formation of life.  This is a narrow range<br>
but still it will have less information content then the actual parameters<br>
which are somewhere within that range.<br>
<p>
These two questions seem to be largely independent, and the second is<br>
what I was trying to address.<br>
<p>
I think what you need to do is to come up with different theories that<br>
predict the creation of the universe in a form which can allow life.<br>
Then you can compare the information content of the theories to see which<br>
is simplest.  But "the parameters of the single universe are chosen<br>
randomly" is not a valid contending theory because it does not predict<br>
the existence of life with any significant probability.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure how to take into account the fact that different models<br>
may allow for the creation of life only with some probability.  My<br>
preference would be to consider models in which the creation of life<br>
is a certainty.  Then you are comparing apples to apples when you count<br>
the size of the theory.<br>
<p>
Two possible theories, as I mentioned, are first that you create all<br>
possible universes with all different variations on the parameters<br>
we observe.  This is probably a pretty simple theory.  The other is<br>
that you create some kind of primordial universe, maybe very different<br>
in nature from our own, possibly mathematical in form, but such that<br>
intelligent life can evolve.  Then that intelligent life will naturally<br>
create simulations or baby universes which explore all different kinds<br>
of physics, including structured ones like ours with matter, space,<br>
distance, time, dimensions, etc., concepts which may be absent from their<br>
own universe.  Conceivably this could also be an extremely simple theory.<br>
We really don't know nearly enough at this point to know what theory is<br>
going to be the simplest.<br>
