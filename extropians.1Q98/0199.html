I would really like to see some kind of investment list started<br>
up!<br>
<p>
Hypermart is looking for investors now if anyone is interested<br>
in talking to us. We were the first company to begin offering<br>
free hosting services for businesses about 3 months ago, and<br>
remain the leader in this area. We believe we are moving into<br>
an exponentional growth period as the meme of free hosting<br>
for businesses begins to spread- we are now seeing more than<br>
100 businesses join our service each day (had 166 on Sunday).<br>
<p>
We believe we are in an excellent position as search engines<br>
and other online services (MSN) continue to add free services<br>
to their sites; we think a buyout will be likely within 12-18<br>
months.<br>
<p>
At this time we are looking for additional investors to help<br>
us maintain our level of service as it becomes necessary to<br>
rapidly expand to keep up with our demand. You may contact me<br>
at 404-347-9864 if you are interested!<br>
