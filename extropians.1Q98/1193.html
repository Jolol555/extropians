<i>&gt; You mean halogen lightbulbs? I don't know about the situation in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; US, but here in Sweden they are actively pushed by the electricity</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies (yes, our electricity companies try to make us consume less</i><br>
<i>&gt; electricity, and the liquor monopoly does it best to discourage</i><br>
<i>&gt; drinking. Sweden is fantastic :-).</i><br>
<p>
U.S. electric companies are very active in encouraging conservation <br>
as well, for very valid economic reasons.  Conservation over the last <br>
2 decades has enabled most of the industry to avoid building new base <br>
capacity, an *extremely* expensive proposition.  Since they are a <br>
regulated monopoly, and prices are set by government bureaucrats, it <br>
can be very difficult to recover these capital costs.  These facts, <br>
by the way, are the reason nuclear power is considered "uneconomic" <br>
in this country, not anything inherent to nuclear technology.<br>
<p>
Liquor companies, on the other hand.....<br>
