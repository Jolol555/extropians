Yep, but lose that nasty `artificial' instantly!  We all know how hateful<br>
`artificial' things are - like dental fillings and cars and clothings...<br>
Actually, I suspect most people here are closing their eyes to the real<br>
complexity of this kind of reaction.  Rather than simply rail against the<br>
evil Luddites, it might help to understand what mental templates or gadgets<br>
are being activated against cloning.  The so-called `Yuck factor' is not to<br>
be despised but understood.  It helps save our lives or at least our<br>
comfort quite a lot of the time.  Hence it's largely out of our control,<br>
once the switches have been set in infancy.  Consider the fact that you<br>
happily swallow pints of your own saliva every week, and even scoff down a<br>
juicy mouthful from your kissy friend (if you're in luck), but would you<br>
drink a warm cup of your own spit?  I didn't think so.  Yuck!<br>
<p>
And the rhetorial move I outlined at the start - mocking the fear of<br>
artifice when everything in life is imbricated with it - is pretty suspect<br>
in turn.  It's based, I suspect, on the false premise that most people *do*<br>
relish these innovations.  On one level, yes, you'd be mad to wish to stand<br>
out in the snow if you could come inside and sit in front of the glowing<br>
heater.  But most of these benefits have endlessly irritating side-effects<br>
- the dread and discomfort if not pain of the dentist, the annoyance of<br>
washing the car and paying for the damned thing and keeping it fed and<br>
putting up with the cretins on the road and where the hell will I park...<br>
Behind that is the deep yearning, perhaps, for the signifiers of our ESS -<br>
the savanna landscape, the pulse of a slow hunting/gathering cycle, the<br>
familiarity of a genetically bonded band where our inborn device for<br>
scoping out what's on everyone else's mind works best.<br>
<p>
On top of that, there really *are* plenty of reasonable objections to<br>
people producing `assisted twins' that are not of the same age, but of<br>
different generations and clearly meant to be subject to all manner of<br>
unprecedented psychological pressures from their 40 or 50 year-older<br>
brother or sister slash `parent'.  Bad enough to be T. H. Huxley's son<br>
(although okay to be his grandchild), which almost ruined Leonard Huxley as<br>
I recall - imagine the horrors of being his *cloned child*.<br>
<p>
There's more involved in these apparently stupid reaction than can easily<br>
be dismissed, I'd submit.<br>
