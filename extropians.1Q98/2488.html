The importance of this thread comes from the possibility<br>
that many people seem to operate *as if* they are subject<br>
to some kind of "peme program" implanted in their brains.<br>
<p>
The peme program seems to consist of the "peme rules"<br>
(included as an Appendix to this post) -- or a similar<br>
set of rules (could also vary from person to person) --<br>
together with a set of "surface pemes" and a set of "deep<br>
pemes" (definitions below).<br>
<p>
I speculate that the power, survival, and expansion of<br>
coercive political systems depend on "subjects" acting<br>
more or less in blind obedience to their peme programs.<br>
To the extent that individuals free themselves from their<br>
peme programs, coercive political systems lose their<br>
power over these individuals.<br>
<p>
I don't know the origin of peme programs.  Maybe they<br>
stem from some kind of "spontaneous cultural or genetic<br>
conspiracy."  Historically, the disobedient disbelievers<br>
had their heads chopped off or were burnt at the stake.<br>
The survivors were the ones who behaved in accordance<br>
with peme programs.<br>

<i>&gt;Ok, could we get a working definition if PEMES and KEMES.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Pemes are political memes.  They consist of ideas, concepts,<br>
phrases, and terms, the use of which increases the power of<br>
the "masters" who operate coercive political systems; while<br>
their use reduces the power of the "subjects" of coercive<br>
political systems.<br>
<p>
There are surface pemes and deep pemes.  Surface pemes are<br>
relatively easy to identify and invalidate.  An example of<br>
a surface peme is "mandate from the people."  This is used<br>
by politicians and bureaucrats to "justify" their coercive<br>
actions.  It increases their power.  "Subjects" who accept<br>
the "mandate from the people" peme, effectively reduce their<br>
own power because they "authorize" politicians and bureaucrats<br>
to take coercive actions against "subjects."<br>
<p>
Deep pemes are much more difficult to identify as such and<br>
to invalidate.  Deep pemes are generally accepted as valid<br>
by practically all people, including freedom lovers.  If you<br>
try to question, attack, or invalidate a deep peme, most<br>
people will think you're crazy.<br>

Is anyone out there interested in writing an SF novel<br>
on pemes.  I would be happy to collaborate and ensure<br>
publication, if we can produce a worthwhile product.<br>

I don't think this thread should be about proving<br>
anyone "right" or "wrong."  It should rather be<br>
about determining the validity or otherwise of<br>
my peme theory.  If valid, then the next step<br>
would be to identify all the pemes and to discover<br>
how people can clear them from their brains.<br>
<p>
Maybe you could make a list of all the pemes<br>
you've either cleared from your brain, or were<br>
never infected by in the first place.<br>

<p>
APPENDIX - PEME RULES<br>
=====================<br>
<p>
1. Peme survival and propagation is the ultimate<br>
imperative.<br>
<p>
2. Pemes shall infect, pervade, and absolutely<br>
rule all human brains.<br>
<p>
3. There shall be surface pemes and deep pemes.<br>
<p>
4. Pemes shall divide humans into opposing and<br>
conflicting political and economic factions --<br>
such as "conservative"/"liberal," "capitalist"/<br>
"socialist," and "statist"/"anarchist" -- who<br>
shall endlessly argue, fight, and even kill...<br>
in the name of pemes.<br>
<p>
5. All humans shall be subjected to "compulsory<br>
education" (a surface peme) to ensure that their<br>
brains are thoroughly implanted with both surface<br>
and deep pemes.<br>
<p>
6. Surface pemes shall induce mild soporific,<br>
stupefying, and debilitating effects in human<br>
brains.<br>
<p>
7. Deep pemes shall induce severe soporific,<br>
stupefying, and debilitating effects in human<br>
brains.<br>
<p>
8. Some humans shall attack and even expose<br>
certain surface pemes -- such as "national<br>
security," "public interest," "gun control,"<br>
etc. -- while others shall justify and defend<br>
these surface pemes.<br>
<p>
9. Under no circumstances shall any human be<br>
allowed to question, attack, or expose any deep<br>
pemes.<br>
<p>
10. Any humans who have cleared a few surface<br>
pemes from their brains shall deceive themselves<br>
into believing that they've cleared all pemes<br>
from their brains and that they're "politically<br>
enlightened."<br>
<p>
11. Any humans who attempt to clear any deep<br>
pemes from their brains shall experience a<br>
strong and compelling inner voice telling them,<br>
"I've got to stop this or I'll go crazy!"<br>
<p>
12. Any human who attempts to question, attack,<br>
or expose any deep peme shall be ignored,<br>
ridiculed, or vilified by other humans.<br>
<p>
13. Pemes shall further divide humans into<br>
a political "master" class and a "citizen<br>
subject" class.  The former shall rule the<br>
latter.<br>
<p>
14. "Citizen subjects" shall pay "their taxes"<br>
(a surface peme) to their political "masters"<br>
-- to maximize the survival potential of the<br>
primary peme purveyors.<br>
<p>
15. Surface pemes (to a small extent) and<br>
deep pemes (to an extreme extent) shall<br>
increase the power of the political "master"<br>
class.<br>
<p>
16. Surface pemes (to a small extent) and<br>
deep pemes (to an extreme extent) shall<br>
reduce the power of the "citizen subject"<br>
class.<br>
<p>
17. Pemes shall also divide humans into a<br>
pro-freedom faction and an anti-freedom<br>
faction.<br>
<p>
18. Whenever anti-freedom humans (primary<br>
peme purveyors) communicate, they shall<br>
make a special effort to use both surface<br>
and deep pemes in their language -- in<br>
order to maximize peme survival and<br>
propagation.<br>
<p>
19. Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary<br>
peme purveyors) communicate -- although<br>
they may question, attack, and expose a<br>
few surface pemes -- they shall make a<br>
special effort to use deep pemes in their<br>
language -- in order to maximize peme<br>
survival and propagation.<br>
<p>
20. At the deepest level, pemes shall<br>
operate through a special class of humans<br>
called "lawyers" as the most powerful peme<br>
purveyors of all.<br>
<p>
21. At a broader level, pemes shall<br>
operate through "preachers," "politicians,"<br>
"bureaucrats," "teachers," etc. as primary<br>
peme purveyors.<br>
<p>
22. A special class of humans called<br>
"police" shall -- using violence if<br>
necessary -- protect some humans and<br>
attack or punish others, as directed<br>
by pemes (such as "justice," "law and<br>
order," etc.) in the brains of "lawyers"<br>
(sometimes called "judges"), "politicians,"<br>
"bureaucrats," etc.<br>
<p>
23. At a planetary level, pemes shall<br>
divide humans into sometimes opposing<br>
and conflicting "countries" and "nations."<br>
<p>
24. Under the direction of "politicians,"<br>
a special kind of human called "soldiers"<br>
shall attack and kill, not only humans in<br>
opposing or conflicting "countries" and<br>
"nations," but sometimes also humans from<br>
their own "country" or "nation."<br>
<p>
25. When activated by thought or communication,<br>
pemes shall induce in humans emotions and<br>
attitudes which shall include fear, blind<br>
obedience, idolatrous worship, resistance,<br>
resentment, rebelliousness, anger, hate,<br>
revenge, the urge to kill, etc.<br>
<p>
26. In general, pemes shall direct humans<br>
to engage in all kinds of plots, conspiracies,<br>
betrayals, vicious infighting, dramatic legal<br>
battles, scandals, rebellions, revolutions,<br>
wars, etc. in order to create spectacles that<br>
keep human brains occupied, entertained, or<br>
traumatized, and to divert their attention<br>
from discovering pemes (particularly deep<br>
pemes).<br>
<p>
27. No human shall be allowed to understand<br>
these peme rules -- in order to maximize<br>
peme survival and propagation.<br>
<p>
28. All humans shall ignore, ridicule, or<br>
vilify anyone who attempts to communicate<br>
these peme rules -- in order to maximize<br>
peme survival and propagation.<br>
