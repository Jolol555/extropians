Yesterday I remembered an interesting point:<br>
<p>
Let's pay attention to "C"hurch's  declarations about human clones...<br>
<p>
I would not get surprized if they would tell idiotnesses to justify their<br>
positionment, like:<br>
<p>
HUMAN CLONES HAVE NO SOUL OR SPIRIT....<br>
<p>
And repeat their ignorant behaviour as when around 1500's to 1600's a mission<br>
of the Church said that the American indians were like animals and *had no<br>
soul*...<br>
Then there was no problem when Spanish (or other)  soldiers killed them...<br>
<p>
And more: In the name of   "G"od...<br>
<p>
Gomes.<br>
<p>
PS: Does anybody know if they have unsaid that publically... or "believers"<br>
did not impose that... and even justified such<br>
behaviour ??? <br>
