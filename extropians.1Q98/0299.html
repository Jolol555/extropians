Trivial; but also not supported.  The primary distinction of lifespan <br>
arises from reproductive costs, population growth rates, and the probability <br>
of adult survival.  (Futuyma, "Evolutionary Biology" p. 273-273)  Predation,<br>
which is hard to evolve for, generates the same results as disease and<br>
parasitism, which are generally easier to evolve for.<br>
<p>
Where the hazards of reproduction and the growth rates<br>
are low and the probability of adult survival high (e.g. trees) populations<br>
reproduce continuously over their adult lifespan.  Such populations evolve<br>
to live as long as possible - there is virtually no selectable variation <br>
for lifespan.  (M.R. Rose "Laboratory Evolution of Postponed Aging" Evolution<br>
38: 1004-1010)  What selectable lifespan variation remains is strongly tied<br>
to negative things, primarily late reproduction.<br>
<p>
Where the hazards of reproduction and the growth rates<br>
are high and the probability of adult survival low (e.g. salmon) individuals<br>
reproduce only once.  Here evolution does indeed tune lifespans for optimal<br>
reproduction (sorry, no references in the house).  Such individuals, however<br>
don't age; they die in the prime of life, usually from hormonal death clocks.<br>
If this premature death is prevented, the creatures usually live greatly<br>
extended spans, displaying typical aging features.<br>
