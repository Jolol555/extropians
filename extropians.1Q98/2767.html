<i>        &gt;I'd rather have a caning than a year in jail btw</i><br>
<p>
Me too, but I'm not a 82 year old 89 pound grandmother.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;First of all I think that revenge is a valid reason to punish too.         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Why not?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I can't tell you why anymore than I can tell you why life is better than <br>
death.        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Example: a lion kills a member of a group of humans. Unlike dumb         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;herbivores (for example) they likely won't just accept the loss and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;go on, but they'll want to punish that lion</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, if they're really intelligent they won't want to punish the lion, they'll <br>
want to kill it. Time wasted in causing the lion more pain before they  kill <br>
it could be better spent looking for food or dealing with other dangerous lions.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;As a kind of compromise you could consider freezing executed         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;criminals as a standard practice. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not with my money! I'm amazed, I thought you were tough on crime. Another <br>
thing I was amazed at is when you included slander as a crime worthy of <br>
punishment. In the first place I don't want the government or anybody else to <br>
get into the truth determining business, I'd rather do that  myself, in the <br>
second place, if you don't like the sound I make with my mouth then make some <br>
sounds of your own to contradict them.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Full agreement here! Cameras and microphones all over as far as</i><br>
<i>        &gt;I'm concerned (all public spaces like streets, parks, malls,</i><br>
<i>        &gt;tunnels etc.), all with interlocking fields of view. Some highly</i><br>
<i>        &gt;visible, some hidden. Also cops should have small personal</i><br>
<i>        &gt;cameras &amp; listening devices on their clothing and on their gun</i><br>
<i>        &gt;(to be auto- activated whenever the  gun is drawn). Personal</i><br>
<i>        &gt;cams etc. should be highly recommended to private citizens too.</i><br>
<i>        &gt;The images are automatically send to various central databanks</i><br>
<i>        &gt;with either completely free or highly monitored access, and</i><br>
<i>        &gt;local copies (near the cam/audio device itself) are kept too</i><br>
<i>        &gt;(and can be downloaded into the general databanks at designated</i><br>
<i>        &gt;points (or via your PC or whatever). Everything is auto-dated</i><br>
<i>        &gt;for later reference. Of course all certified recordings have</i><br>
<i>        &gt;full power of evidence in a court of law. </i><br>
                   <br>

That sounds a lot like Science Fiction writer David Brin's fist non fiction <br>
book called "The  Transparent Society", I don't know it it's been published <br>
yet. Brin advocates a world where nobody, not the President not the lowest <br>
bum, could have any secrets. Cameras would be everywhere and be available to <br>
all at any time, also, all files and records of any sort  would be open to<br>
anybody who wanted to read them. You would know all of my deep dark secrets <br>
but I would know all of yours, the police could spy on you all they want but <br>
you could spy on the police as well.<br>
<p>
Mr. Brin's idea is not going to work, and I politely explained to him why, at <br>
that point a totally unexpected phenomena occurred, Mr. Brin went non linear.  <br>
In the interest of fairness I should tell you that Mr. Brin is not one of my <br>
favorite people and when his big budget movie flopped spectacularly last<br>
Christmas I felt a tinge of joy at his misfortune, but at least I had the <br>
good grace to be ashamed of myself. By the way, I never read "The Postman" or <br>
saw the movie and probably never will, but "the Holnists" are in it and I'd <br>
be interested if anybody knows what they (it?) are, I have a hunch it's <br>
something pretty nasty because Brin compared me to them and I'm quite sure<br>
he wasn't trying to give me a compliment.<br>
<p>
Anyway, as I told Mr. Brin, I personally find his idea repulsive but that's  <br>
irrelevant because it's not going to happen. Brin's world is inherently  <br>
unstable, so discussing its merits is like talking about if it would be fun  <br>
to live in a world where the second law of thermodynamics worked backward.    <br>
If nobody in the world has secrets except me, that means I know all about the<br>
marketing plans and product development of your company but you know nothing  <br>
about mine, that gives my company an advantage, it will grow and so will the  <br>
privacy meme. On the other hand, if I tell all and have no secrets but  <br>
everybody else has secrets, then it is my company will be at a disadvantage <br>
and shrink, and so  will the transparency meme.  <br>
<p>
Brin's  assuming that by some black magic everyone can tell if I'm using  <br>
cryptography, but in actuality, the fact that I have a secret is a secret. <br>
There are ways of putting information in a form so that it's useful to me and <br>
nobody else, or if I prefer, I can make it useful to you and me and nobody <br>
else. There are ways I can prove that I have a certain piece of secret <br>
information without giving you the slightest clue as to what that information <br>
is. There are ways of using DC nets so that you not only don't know what I'm <br>
saying you don't even know who I'm talking to. There are ways of using <br>
Steganography so you not only don't know who I'm talking to, you don't even <br>
know I'm talking.<br>
<p>
What about cameras, if I can see what you're typing cryptography does no good.<br>
<p>
Well, Brin generously granted us privacy in the bedroom and bathroom (what a <br>
swell guy) and that's all I'd need.<br>
<p>
OK, just for that you can't have privacy even there.<br>
<p>
Then I'd find the camera in my bedroom, splice into the video line, and play <br>
back a recording of me reading the Bible, saluting the flag, marching around <br>
the bed in time to martial music and generally being a good little boy. Now I <br>
can do what I want.<br>
<p>
But cameras can be very small nowadays, how will you find it?<br>
<p>
I'll just go down to Big Brother's Ministry Of Truth and ask.<br>
<p>
They'll see you splice into the line.<br>
<p>
There are far too many cameras for somebody to be watching all of them all of <br>
the time, I'll do it when nobody is watching.<br>
<p>
How will you know when nobody is watching?<br>
<p>
I'll ask.<br>
<p>
What if they make recordings?<br>
<p>
Now that I have a little privacy I'll take my time, hack into the system and <br>
alter the recording. This only has to be done one time by one person because <br>
now I'm in a position to help my friends.<br>
<p>
How will you know how to get around network security?<br>
<p>
I'll ask.<br>
<p>
What if there is a secret camera you don't know about?<br>
<p>
Then I'm in trouble, but Big Brother is in worse trouble. Think of the <br>
scandal! Big Brother, the very apostle of transparency has a secret, what <br>
other secrets does he have? How can anybody ever trust him again?<br>
<p>
