It seems like many people posting to this list have forgotten what sort<br>
of list this is supposed to be.  There are certain kinds of topics this<br>
list was intended to discuss (not President Clinton's alleged sex-affair<br>
or government conspiracies).  Topics outside the scope of this list<br>
should be discussed outside this list.  There are many other mailing<br>
lists and chat-rooms to discuss such things.  <br>
<p>
Also, this is an *Extropian* list, which means that extropians are<br>
reading it.  Extropians tend to prefer things of high quality (one could<br>
even think of Extropianism as the quest to increase the quality of the<br>
universe).  I don't think most of us want to read the low-quality<br>
postings that come through every day.  You know what I'm talking about: <br>
the one or two line response, the posts that ramble on aimlessly,<br>
argumentative or insulting posts, etc.  Just because we're interested in<br>
life-extension doesn't mean we want to use our extra time reading inane<br>
or unthoughtful posts.  We are extropians, after all; our time is<br>
valuable to us.<br>
<p>
So, please, before you send anything to this list, ask yourself if other<br>
extropians *really* are going to be interested in what you write.  If<br>
not, don't send it.  Just send the good stuff, well-organized,<br>
well-thought-out and well-written.  Please don't send impulsive<br>
one-liners or insults or incoherent ramblings; restrain yourself.<br>
<p>
Thank you,<br>
<p>
