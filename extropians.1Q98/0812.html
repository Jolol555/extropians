<i>&gt;Seriously, though. If you look at things from the perspective of social</i><br>
<i>&gt;darwinism, an argument can be made that Government -- as a concept --</i><br>
<i>&gt;must have been, if not beneficial, then at least a functiona, rugged,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and competitive concept at some time in the past. Otherwise it wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;be so ubiquitous today.</i><br>
<p>
Of course.  It is a successful parasite or predator and we are the<br>
host or prey.  Just because it's higher on the food chain,<br>
doesn't mean it's better or worse than us.  But it is our enemy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't like facile generalisations like "government BAD" and "free market</i><br>
<i>&gt;GOOD". Both institutions may bring benefits and may be open to abuse,</i><br>
<i>&gt;depending on the specific implementation.</i><br>
<p>
Huh?  Food is good for us and predators are bad.  Perhaps in some self-<br>
flagilating sense too much food makes us lazy and disease weeds out the<br>
weak leaving the strong.  But in that case we're the strong but underfed<br>
ones and it makes perfect sense to say: food is good and disease is bad.<br>
<p>
Still, the self-flagilating truth is that government evolved from an<br>
instability caused by our ignorance and fallacious beliefs.  It has<br>
prospered by taking advantage of our imperfections and even discovering<br>
more and more of them.  It actually has taught us things, demonstrated<br>
dangers, and yet without destroying us totally (yet).  Yippee.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I want to know is WHY</i><br>
<i>&gt;governments at the end of the twentieth century have become bloated,</i><br>
<i>&gt;inefficient, and counterproductive monsters that are resented by many</i><br>
<i>&gt;of their citizens.</i><br>
<p>
The demonstration continues.  Because they can afford to.  Because we,<br>
their food source, are sheep who haven't destroyed them.  I don't see<br>
what's so mysterious.  Rot advances unless you stop it.  It has no<br>
interest in being efficient, productive or not bloated.  Eating and<br>
spreading is what it does, just like any successful, evolved life form.<br>
Don't you understand your own idea?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyone got any good ideas? (Preferably ones that haven't been hashed</i><br>
<i>&gt;over until they're dead meat already; if the Extropians list is anything</i><br>
<i>&gt;like it was in the old days, even _whispering_ the idea that government</i><br>
<i>&gt;isn't automatically evil is going to induce a Pavlovian reaction among</i><br>
<i>&gt;some of the less flexible libertarian subscribers.)</i><br>
<p>
You don't have to whisper.  My only reaction is mystification.  Here is<br>
not the place to go over these basics, aren't there economics books on the<br>
recommended reading list?  Haven't you read them?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Better still: anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;prepared to put on their Devil's Advocate hat and pretend to be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;government employee trying to explain why what they do is _good_ ?</i><br>
<p>
If you don't have any ideas, what's the point?  Do you want someone<br>
to advocate Santa Claus just because you think he *can't* be *all*<br>
fictional?  I think you're taking a sense of fairness a little too far.<br>
"Quid pro con," don't you know: the fallacy that there must be two sides<br>
to every issue.<br>
