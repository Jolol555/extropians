A scary reminder that we need to do what we can to either keep<br>
technological advances out of terrocrats' hands, or ensure that individuals<br>
can keep pace with and counteract governments' use of technology.<br>

===============================================<br>
<p>
Do you have any privacy left when Big Brother<br>
can spy on you from space -- or through your walls?<br>
        WASHINGTON, DC -- Spy satellites. Gamma ray scanners.<br>
Thermal-imaging devices.<br>
        It's not science fiction -- it's a list of the exotic,<br>
high-tech surveillance equipment the government now uses to monitor,<br>
track, and arrest American citizens, the Libertarian Party pointed out<br>
today.<br>
        "Yesterday's science fiction has become today's political<br>
reality," said Steve Dasbach, the party's national chairman. "High-tech<br>
military equipment that was once used against foreign armies is now<br>
being used against American citizens on a routine basis."<br>
        As a result, the Fourth Amendment's protection against<br>
"unreasonable search" is under technological siege, he warned -- and<br>
government agencies are rushing to take advantage of this new power.<br>
        "Most people don't realize it, but law enforcement agencies are<br>
now spying on us through the walls of our houses, taking<br>
high-resolution photographs of us from space, and conducting drug tests<br>
based on trace elements of chemicals in the air," said Dasbach.<br>
        Paranoid fantasy? Not at all: Such high-tech surveillance<br>
equipment is becoming an increasingly common tool for law enforcement,<br>
according to reports in USA Today and the Wall Street Journal.<br>
        Here's a sampling of how state and federal agencies are using<br>
this terrifying technology to spy on Americans:<br>
        * In North Carolina, county governments use high-resolution spy<br>
satellite photographs to search for property improvements that might<br>
increase property tax assessments.<br>
        * On the Mexican border, police use a "gamma ray scanner" to<br>
check tanker trucks for contraband, scanning right through the<br>
vehicle's metal sides.<br>
        * The Naval Surface Warfare Center has developed an "ion<br>
sniffer," a metal box that analyzes the chemical makeup of the air --<br>
and can detect, for example, traces of cocaine through the skin days<br>
after drug use.<br>
        * In Georgia, the state's Department of Revenue will start<br>
using NASA satellites to examine the state's 58,910 square miles for<br>
illegal timber cutting.<br>
        * In New Jersey, California, and other states, police use<br>
thermal imaging devices to scan houses for unusual heat sources that<br>
could indicate indoor marijuana growing operations. Houses can be<br>
scanned while police sit in their cruisers on the street.<br>
        * And in Arizona, the state's Department of Water Resources<br>
uses spy satellite photographs to monitor 750,000 acres of state<br>
farmland, and compares the images to a database to discover which<br>
farmers don't have irrigation permits.<br>
        Even worse: The federal government will spend another $4.5<br>
million this year to develop even more intrusive surveillance<br>
equipment.<br>
        Currently under development by the Justice Department: A "super<br>
x-ray" -- combining traditional x-ray technology, ultra-sound imaging,<br>
and computer-aided metal detectors -- to reveal items hidden under<br>
clothes from up to 60 feet away.<br>
        The courts are currently wrestling with the implications of the<br>
new technology, debating the limits of the government's power to<br>
"search" individuals from a distance with high-tech gadgets. Several<br>
contradictory court decisions have already emerged, for example, about<br>
whether thermal-imaging searches are Constitutional.<br>
        Meanwhile, Republican and Democratic politicians continue to<br>
look for new uses of the technology -- with some government officials<br>
already talking about using satellite surveillance to track items as<br>
small as backyard porches to check for zoning violations and<br>
construction permits.<br>
        "In the name of fighting crime, politicians seem eager to<br>
obliterate the protections against unreasonable search, with equipment<br>
that Americans used to only read about in Tom Clancy technothrillers,"<br>
said Dasbach. "It's time for the American public to wake up and realize<br>
that Big Brother is here today -- and he's got a gamma ray scanner in<br>
his hand."<br>
