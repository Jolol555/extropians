I agree. However asking someone to help you helping others is not<br>
'foisting' it is a respectful request or a plea. You still keep control.<br>
<p>

Maybe Mark Miloscia is hoping that he can convince you of his point of<br>
view, by presenting his case to you in a resonable manner based on respect<br>
for you as an individual. Maybe Mark Miloscia is hoping that if he<br>
convinces you this will benefit the people he is trying to help himself. As<br>
long as no coercion is involved it seems to me that figuring ou ways te<br>
prevent people from dying, even if we don't know them and they are living<br>
thousand of miles away, is a very Extropian thing to do.<br>
