<i>&gt; From: Paul Hughes &lt;organix@hotmail.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Has anyone heard of the city Auroville?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes.  I used to live at one of Aurovilles sister communities Arcosanti, </i><br>
<i>&gt; in Arizona.  Many of the people I knew at "Arco" spent several years at </i><br>
<i>&gt; Auroville.  They all came back with positive experiences.   My only </i><br>
<i>&gt; doubts about its appropriatness for extropians though is Auroville is in </i><br>
<i>&gt; India, which by our living standards is till relatively underdeveloped.  </i><br>
Personally, I don't think a truly liberal community should be too close to,<br>
let alone within, the main territory of an existing nation, especially a big one.<br>
Sooner or later there's bound to be trouble, like with the Goa hippy community<br>
in India. In an emergency situation, you *might* be able to smash an offensive <br>
banana republic, but *not* the USA, India, France etc. Btw, aren't there any<br>
islands left with no claims on them?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That, and the fact that there is already an established 'culture' their </i><br>
<i>&gt; consisting of 6,000 people which by its very nature may have some </i><br>
<i>&gt; unforseen constraints which the more indivudalistic of us may find too </i><br>
<i>&gt; constrainig.</i><br>
Absolutely, it's better to start from scratch on your own terms. Otherwise,<br>
you'll just switch one suppressive bureaucracy for another (and possibly a<br>
worse one).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My experiences at Arcosanti were invaluable!  So I encourage anyone who </i><br>
<i>&gt; is thinking along the lines of forming an extropain intentional </i><br>
<i>&gt; community, to experience the strengths and pitfalls of another one first  </i><br>
<i>&gt; before setting out on your own.  Better to learn from others successes </i><br>
<i>&gt; and failures first rather than to start out completely from scratch.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
What *are* in your opinion the major strengths and pitfalls of a "private<br>
community"? Is money the biggest problem, or personal rivalry, governments<br>
etc? Maybe some others with personal experience in this field could join in, <br>
that would be very interesting...<br>
