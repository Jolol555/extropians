<i>&gt; And I guess that tells you where I stand on the omnivorous scale...</i><br>
<p>
I frequently annoy certain veggiefanatics who say "if you ever saw an <br>
animal butchered, you'd never eat meat again."<br>
<p>
Because I look at them square in the face and say "I have personally <br>
taken cute furry little bunnies from the pen where they were being <br>
raised to the slaughter room, butchered them, hauled them up to the <br>
kitchen, cooked them, and helped eat them."<br>
<p>
  ------------------<br>
<p>
It works on the flip side too.  If  I had any doubt about the <br>
atrocities the federal government committed a few years ago at Waco, <br>
the story that they were using tape recordings of rabbits being <br>
"slaughtered" for psychological warfare would totally remove those <br>
doubts.<br>
<p>
I know exactly what slaughtering a rabbit sounds like.  It's almost <br>
silent.<br>
<p>
I also know what a screaming rabbit sounds like.  THAT would be a <br>
good psychological warfare tool.  But in order to make rabbits <br>
scream, you need to torture them (or at least make them think they <br>
are being tortured).  And torturing is not part of a competent <br>
slaughtering operation.  In fact it degrades the quality of the meat <br>
(adrenaline or something changes the taste).<br>
<p>
The federal government was playing tapes of someone TORTURING <br>
rabbits.<br>
