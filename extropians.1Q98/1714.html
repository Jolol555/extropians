Recently, I have received an Unsolicited Commercial E-mail from you.<br>
I do not like UCE's and I would like to inform you that sending<br>
unsolicited messages to someone while he or she may have to pay for<br>
reading your message may be illegal.  Anyway, it is highly annoying<br>
and not welcome by anyone.  It is rude, after all.<br>
<p>
If you think that this is a good way to advertise your products or<br>
services you are mistaken.  Spamming will only make people hate you, not<br>
buy from you.<br>
<p>
If you have any list of people you send unsolicited commercial emails to, <br>
REMOVE me from such list immediately.  I suggest that you make this list <br>
just empty.<br>
<p>
	----------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
If you are not an administrator of any site and still have received<br>
this message then your email address is being abused by some spammer.<br>
They fake your address in From: or Reply-To: header.  In this case,<br>
you might want to show this message to your system administrator, and<br>
ask him/her to investigate this matter.<br>
<p>
Note to the postmaster(s): I append the text of UCE in question to<br>
this message; I would like to hear from you about action(s) taken.<br>
This message has been sent to postmasters at the host that is<br>
mentioned as original sender's host (I do realize that it may be<br>
faked, but I think that if your domain name is being abused this way<br>
you might want to learn about it, and take actions) and to the<br>
postmaster whose host was used as mail relay for this message.  If<br>
message was sent not by your user, could you please compare time when<br>
this message was sent (use time in Received: field of the envelope<br>
rather than Date: field) with your sendmail logs and see what host was<br>
using your sendmail at this moment of time.<br>
<p>
Thank you.<br>

EMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!<br>
<p>
Bull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.<br>
This program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email<br>
addresses.  Doctors, florists, MLM, biz opp,...you can collect<br>
anything...you are only limited by your imagination!  You can<br>
even collect email addresses for specific states, cities, and<br>
even countries!  All you need is your web browser and this program.<br>
Our software utilizes the latest in search technology called<br>
"spidering". By simply feeding the spider program a starting<br>
website it will collect for hours. The spider will go from website<br>
to targeted website providing you with thousands upon thousands of<br>
fresh TARGETED email addresses. When you are done collecting,  the<br>
spider removes duplicates and saves the email list in a ready to<br>
send format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to<br>
get a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!<br>
<p>
A terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is<br>
no difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo<br>
to learn. All you need to know is how to search for your targeted<br>
market in one of the many search engines and let the spider do the<br>
rest! Not familiar with the search engines? No problem, we provide<br>
you with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the<br>
location of a search engine on your browser then search for the<br>
market you wish to reach...it's that easy!<br>
<p>
For instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors<br>
in New York all you would do is:<br>
<p>
1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in<br>
the words doctor(s) and New York<br>
2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the<br>
<a href="http://..">http://..</a>.  for instance it might look like<br>
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s">http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s</a>)/?New+York<br>
3) Press the START button<br>
<p>
THAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites<br>
that are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses<br>
you want.<br>
<p>
The spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all<br>
day or all night while you are working on important things or<br>
just having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a<br>
constant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give<br>
it praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at<br>
the end of the day!<br>
<p>
