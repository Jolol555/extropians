Isn't this one of the proposed methodoligies suggested by the Rio summit?<br>
Aren't companies in some US states already exchanging polution credits?<br>

Consumer unions? I pay for a sub to _Consumer Reports_ (although I still<br>
just use it as a starting point for my own product evaluations). I might<br>
pay to subscribe to a Consumer watchdog org that specifically kept tabs on<br>
stuff like this, and had the chops to get the word out so that<br>
consumers/citizens could respond. Could that work? Or would such orgs just<br>
be suborned by the companies that were doing the polluting?<br>
<p>
For example, _Consumer Digest_ is an attempt to dilute the effect of _CR_.<br>
Companies can buy space in _CD_ and can advertise that they're a "Consumer<br>
Digest Best Buy", with the obvious goal of confusing consumers into<br>
thinking that it's the highly-reputable _CR_ that's endorsing the product.<br>
