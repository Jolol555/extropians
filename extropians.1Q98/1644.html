<p>
 The word "greed", at least as it is used outside of Objectivist circles,<br>
refers not just to a position on the selfish to selfless axis, but also<br>
to an area on the negative-sum game to positive-sum game axis. Supporting<br>
the welfare state is one alternative to greed, but there exist perfectly<br>
selfish strategies that most people will classify as not at all greedy.<br>
For example, the Linux software development model, or Eric Drexler's "get<br>
rich slow" scheme (make everybody rich through nanotech, and since he's<br>
somebody, he'll be rich).<br>
 I see nothing wrong with the sentiments expressed in the part of Mr.<br>
Bailey's message that you quoted. However, his implication that taxation<br>
promotes sharing is pretty questionable. Taxation is almost always a<br>
negative-sum strategy, which tends to foster greedy attitudes among<br>
the people it affects. In contrast, adopting new positive-sum sharing<br>
strategies tends to foster further support for more sharing.<br>

<i>&gt;giving away computers to schools, admirable as that may be.</i><br>
<p>
 That was probably true at some time, but now that the Linux model for<br>
producing software has shown itself to be superior in many cases, I think<br>
it is perfectly resasonable to critisize Microsoft for being more greedy<br>
than is in it's customer's best interests.<br>
<p>
 Mark, what was the purpose of your libertarian rant? Do you think Mr. Bailey<br>
was unaware of libertarianism? I find it improbable that his support for<br>
taxation results from ignorance of the ideas that taxation is immoral or<br>
that selfishness is good, yet your message seems to do nothing more than<br>
repeat those ideas.<br>
 There's a reason why debating the basics on this list is discouraged: few<br>
of us learn anything from it. This is especially true of messages that agree<br>
with the prevailing ideology on the list.<br>
