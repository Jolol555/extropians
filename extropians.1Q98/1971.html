Curious - this is pretty much the way I recall the storyline and overall<br>
tone from my reading of the novel several years ago.  Apologies to the<br>
author if he's reading this, but it certainly struck me as pretty lurid,<br>
Gothique and downbeat. I was quite taken aback when I heard that Mr James<br>
is an extropian, and that Max More and others on this list regarded the<br>
novel as supporting such views.<br>
<p>
Um, later - Peter James writes:<br>
<p>
`The "vindictive" woman referred to in the TV guide is indeed the dead<br>
girlfriend, but she makes a truly wonderfulpro-extropian speech (written by<br>
Preston Sturges and Mick Garris, not me, so I can say that!)  that is going<br>
to make anyone who watches this think about the subject.'<br>
<p>
Good news for the film, but might not bear on the book, so I guess I should<br>
stand by my remarks above.<br>
