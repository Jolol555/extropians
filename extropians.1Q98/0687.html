I think they said that telomerase production was already turned on<br>
in germ cells (e.g. egg cells).  These cells are already immortal in<br>
the sense that some of their fission daughters become egg cells too,<br>
ad infinitum.  So there must be something in the development process<br>
which turns off telomerase production in most cell lines as they become<br>
specialized.  Arranging to keep telomerase being produced throughout the<br>
development process may be harder than just sticking an extra telomerase<br>
gene into the egg cell.<br>
