Universe to endure and expand forever - astronomers<br>
by Deborah Zabarenko<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Five teams of astronomers training<br>
their sights on the very nature of the universe reported on<br>
Thursday that it is ``lightweight'' -- not terribly dense -- and<br>
is likely to expand and endure forever.<br>
``With 95 percent confidence, we can say the universe is<br>
going to expand forever,'' researcher Ruth Daly of Princeton<br>
University said at a news briefing where all the teams presented<br>
their findings. The denser the universe, the more likely it is to<br>
reach a limit to expansion and to collapse in on itself. But the<br>
researchers found that the universe has only one-fifth the mass<br>
needed to generate the gravity to cause such an end.<br>
What will happen as the lightweight universe infinitely expands?<br>
``Anything that is gravitationally bound will remain<br>
gravitationally bound,'' Daly said.<br>
But because no new structures will form, ``the stars will<br>
just age and die and everything will turn into a burned and<br>
dirty ember. Finally there will be just a bunch of rocks left<br>
... It will be a rather uninteresting and cold place.''<br>
For now, though, there was a bit of rejoicing among the<br>
astronomers that such cosmological questions could be addressed<br>
based on empirical data rather than on theory.<br>
``For the first time ever, we're going to actually have<br>
data, that you will go to an experimentalist to find out what<br>
the cosmology of the universe is, not to a philosopher,'' said<br>
Saul Perlmutter of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.<br>
Perlmutter's team collected data on the light from exploded<br>
stars, known as supernovae, to calculate how fast the universe<br>
is expanding.<br>
By knowing the speed of light and the relative dimness or<br>
brightness of each supernova, they could determine how old and<br>
how far away the supernovae were, and hence could estimate the<br>
expansion rate of the universe.<br>
Much of the data on supernovae were collected from<br>
Earth-based telescopes. But the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope<br>
also observed a specific type of supernova that is considered a<br>
reliable indicator of distance because there is a direct link<br>
between their intrinsic brightness and how fast they fade after<br>
they explode.<br>
Other teams used different methods for dealing with the data<br>
from supernovae, and still others tracked the development and<br>
decay of galactic clusters -- the largest known formations in<br>
the universe -- and the energy from radio galaxies, which emit<br>
huge plumes of radio waves that can be picked up by instruments<br>
on Earth.<br>
The five teams also agreed that the universe is probably<br>
about 15 billion years old, a difference from earlier reports<br>
that put the age at as little as 11 billion years. The higher<br>
age estimate would also retire a modern astronomical conundrum<br>
in which the oldest stars were believed to be older than the<br>
universe itself.<br>

<p>
This interesting article over infobeat imho seems to give the<br>
Tipler scenario of life expanding to the omega point a boost<br>
( life continuing indefinitely into the whole! universe ? )<br>
<p>
I've got some extensions to put in ...<br>
I don't know how the scientist came up with the 1/5 mass thing<br>
can anyone out there enlighten us on the link between supernovae<br>
and the possible open/expanding forever universe .... seems<br>
pretty thin ....<br>
I would think it's going to be an accurate mass census of the<br>
universe .... all the dark stuff etc etc ...<br>
Anyhow, if the universe seems to be forever running away ....<br>
one could envisaged 'creating' more mass to slow down the expansion<br>
so that 'we'(posthumans) and our tech can 'catch' up with the<br>
expansion and ultimately populate the entire universe and resulting<br>
in a stable and hyper-intelligent universe ....<br>
Anyone care to comment <br>
