<i>&gt; &gt;         &gt;beyond that point is by definition, revenge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You're using private definitions, apparently for you the ASCII string</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "revenge" means "justice" and "justice" means "revenge", that's your</i><br>
<i>&gt; right,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one definition is not intrinsically better than another; however, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; effective communication a common definition is useful and that's why</i><br>
<i>&gt; I use</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the standard one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I wasn't saying "Justice is Revenge" because I think revenge is a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; form of justice, but because I think what many people call justice is</i><br>
<i>&gt; simply revenge.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, well you are right there, but that doesn't make them right. Most<br>
people think Bangladesh is somewhere in Africa. Never underestimate the<br>
power of human stupidity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Justice means finding whatever needs to be done to minimize most</i><br>
<i>&gt; suffering in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; most people. I admit that the best solution is often far from</i><br>
<i>&gt; obvious, but at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; least the problem is clear.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I find nothing wrong with people cooperating to rid themselves of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; common threat (in which ever way they see fit.)  But the justice</i><br>
<i>&gt; system goes beyond that, and creates a fixed set of threats which are</i><br>
<i>&gt; apparently (whether you like it or not) for your own good.  And I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would argue that all "punishments" are revenge.</i><br>
<p>
Any judgement that does not a) provide proportionate compensation to the<br>
victims, and b) rehabilitate those that are capable of being<br>
rehabilitated, while eradicating those who are not from the gene pool,<br>
is not justice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Revenge means entertainment obtained by causing pain in somebody</i><br>
<i>&gt; else.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Example:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I take your banana. When I'm not looking you steal the banana back.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Justice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless there's plenty of other banana's around, in which case taking</i><br>
<i>&gt; my banana is vengeful.  Otherwise I agree that you should satisfy your</i><br>
<i>&gt; banana needs.  But I don't see why we need to call that justice.</i><br>
<p>
it is reestablishing the stasis in existence prior to the use of<br>
unjustified force.<br>
A justified force in equal opposition reestablishes the prior state.<br>
Justice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I take your banana. When I'm not looking you steal the banana back,</i><br>
<i>&gt; pour</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; gasoline on me, set me on fire and laugh at my screams of agony as I</i><br>
<i>&gt; burn</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alive and beg for death.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Revenge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
At the same time, if you peacefully ask me for part of my banana, and I<br>
refuse, that is acting justly within ones rights. If I refused, told you<br>
to "go get a job you lousy slacker, you aren't worth a pot of piss, etc<br>
etc etc" and called a cop on you for being a vagrant panhandler,<br>
loitering and harassing pedestrians, that would be another thing<br>
entirely..<br>
