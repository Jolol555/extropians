Below, for your pleasure, a seriously window into the temporarily insane<br>
brain of my bud Kip Repscher. Don't read it if you're easily offended,<br>
have no use for humor, or are not extremely bored.<br>
<p>
The Great Nexus Naming Contest is on!  The winner (whoever comes up<br>
with a name we eventually decide to use) will receive $40, or a nice back<br>
rub,<br>
at our discretion.<br>
<p>
Anyway, here it is. Enjoy!<br>
