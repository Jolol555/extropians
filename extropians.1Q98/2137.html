<i>&gt; &gt;My partner and I have incorporated as an S-Corp.  We have 100 shares of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Stock in our future income stream.  We could sell these shares to anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;under any contract arrangements we wish.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Cool.  But does this cover all future income, or just income earned via </i><br>
<i>&gt; this corporation?  And is this a percentage of gross income, or only after</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain "expenses" are deducted?  And could you contractually commit to</i><br>
<i>&gt; retaining at least say 60% of your income shares, so buyers have reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; to believe you will work hard?</i><br>
<p>
The more I think about this "Human Capital Market", the more I'm<br>
convinced that we already have exactly that, and have had them for<br>
years--they're called Visa and Mastercard.  What's the difference<br>
between Grameen Bank's lending a man $100 to improve his farm, and<br>
Visa lending me $300 for that new hard disk?  Both have made an<br>
investment in my future productivity, Visa just didn't ask as many<br>
questions.<br>
<p>
Theoretically it should be /more/ efficient at encouraging the kind<br>
of speculative ventures that make big gains, because the person<br>
receiving the loan has nothing to answer to except the payments--if<br>
he wants to waste it on vacations, that's fine, as long as he makes<br>
the payments.  That's just more money in the pockets of that<br>
industrious poolboy saving up for his delivery truck.  It amounts<br>
to the same thing--Visa is lending money to people to do whatever<br>
they want, and left to their own ingenuity, people often like to<br>
make more money.<br>
<p>
Personal unsecured credit is essentially the same thing as a loan<br>
on future income.  We've all heard stories about entrepreneurs<br>
being turned down for loans and starting businesses on their credit<br>
cards.  The movie _Hollywoord Shuffle_ was financed entirely on<br>
Townsend's cards because no studio wanted it, and it did well.<br>
<p>
Not to take away the good things Grameen does, but Mastercard did<br>
it first, and does more.<br>
