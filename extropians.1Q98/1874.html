In a probably vain attent to check my tendency to speculative sprawl, I'm<br>
going to respond to some of your many excellent points in a few<br>
individual posts.  If this seems to you to derange the overall flow of<br>
your argument (I don't think that it does, otherwise I wouldn't do it),<br>
know that this was not my intention.<br>

I see what you mean here, but I have to admit that my initial intuition is<br>
exactly the opposite one.  It seems to me that when you have a society<br>
that is working well -- e.g., one that is stable and affords reasonable<br>
assurance of survival and security -- that is exactly when morality should<br>
get more imaginative.  Survival is simple (if only because it is there are<br>
relatively fewer states that count as healthy or functional ones for an<br>
organism, than there are states that count as disease or malfunction), but<br>
*thriving* is complex.  What could be simpler than that practically<br>
hardwired ethical injunction that says:  Reject the New!  Civilization is<br>
importantly the story of how we hacked together frameworks (capital-<br>
formation, legal systems, codes of civility, scientific methods) which<br>
permitted us to reap the benefits of *overcoming* that simple injunction<br>
(even if there was a time when we would not have survived without it). <br>
Risk-taking, experimentalism, connoisseurship are all complex as opposed<br>
to simple practices and attitudes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  To the limited extent that simplicity and intolerance have any correlation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it sure looks to me like it's a negative correlation. The genealogical</i><br>
<i>&gt; contortions needed for racists to keep their rules from being subverted</i><br>
<i>&gt; by interbreeding is hardly as simple as the rule that all humans have</i><br>
<i>&gt; equal rights. Until you mention some examples of connections between</i><br>
<i>&gt; simplicity and intolerance, I will be inclined to assume that your claim</i><br>
<i>&gt; is based on inadequate stereotypes of bigots as being simpler because they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are less educated.</i><br>
<p>
Yikes!  I don't think that's what I think.  Strictly speaking, I don't<br>
believe in such a thing as an "uneducated" person.  The education you get<br>
from the "University of Life" is hardly a simple affair.  I don't know<br>
that respecting rights, or the Golden Rule, or even the noninitiation of<br>
force principle is really *simpler* than racism is.  Racism probably looks<br>
pretty simple to racists, despite their silly and sad genealogical<br>
contortions.  Even the noninitiation of force injunction produces some<br>
real contortions when applied to actual cases (see Friedman's<br>
_Machinery_).  No, what I meant was that the *dream* of simplicity as<br>
applied to morality seems associated with intolerance to me.  It's not<br>
like I think any ethical system could actually manage to be simple really.    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Some more hints about why simplicity is good:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Occam's Razor.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Given 2 pieces of software that can accomplish the same tasks, would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  you prefer the more complex or the simpler?</i><br>
<p>
One shouldn't posit explanatory entities beyond necessity, sure.  But part<br>
of what we're talking about here is that the ethical has (at least) two<br>
relevant registers: necessity and flourishing.  Two pieces of software<br>
accomplish the same task from one angle of view, namely survival, but say<br>
that one of the pieces of software, an ungainly highly complicated thing,<br>
provides an incrementally less robust assurance of survival while at the<br>
same time enabling a much more colorful mode of life.  I'll pick the more<br>
complex one every time.<br>
<p>
More to come.  Best, Dale<br>
