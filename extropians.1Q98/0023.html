<p>
We almost have this now in the United States.<br>
<p>
Ignoring the fact that nothing is 100% perfect, we do have technologies<br>
that detect certain crimes to a very high degree of accuracy.  Drug tests<br>
(high quality ones with lots of redundancy, not the cheap ones used for job<br>
interviews) can detect illegal drug use in a body.  Fingerprinting can<br>
detect presence at a crime scene.  Traffic stops can verify valid driver's<br>
licenses and insurance.  Should we force everybody to undergo mandatory<br>
drugtesting, fingerprinting and routine traffic stops to greatly enhance<br>
the ability to detect certain criminals?  The current answer in the United<br>
States is (theoretically) no.  We have to have reason to believe a person<br>
is guilty before they are investigated in such a manner.  We do not<br>
investigate everybody to make sure we catch the criminals.<br>
<p>
My point is that this is not a theoretical question for the future.  We<br>
have similar technologies now.  Are you proposing that we should submit to<br>
these types of routine procedures today?<br>
