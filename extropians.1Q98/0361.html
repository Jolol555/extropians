Did ya hear the immortal words of the impressive Doctor Seed?<br>
He's the one proposing to start a cloning clinic (because he can<br>
thereby help more people have the children they want) and make a<br>
ton of money (he hopes.)  NPR played a sound bite in which he<br>
justified his plans by using biblical sounding languague to say<br>
something on the order of<br>
<p>
    God made us in his image.  We're becoming more like him all<br>
    the time.  This [developing the ability to clone] is one of<br>
    the important steps we need to take in becoming more like<br>
    God.  God intended for us to be like him, and for us to<br>
    become more like him.<br>
<p>
What wonderful rhetoric!  Can anyone find the exact words that<br>
Dr. Seed (no, I'm not making up the name!) used?  I encourage<br>
extropians to find ways to use rhetoric like that when<br>
appropriate (when talking to the religious or the deluded.)  We're<br>
just doing what God wants; God made us in his image; we're trying<br>
to become more like him in as many ways as possible.<br>
