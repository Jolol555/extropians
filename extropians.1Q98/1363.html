<i>&gt; It seems that like a lot of scientists, there is one variable which may</i><br>
<i>&gt; escape you. Experience. What experience do you have using this drug? You</i><br>
<i>&gt; can speculate about its possible effects on the brain, but it seems that</i><br>
<i>&gt; when you guess at something like this and remove personal experience from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the mix, there's little substance left.</i><br>
<p>
I am a computational neuroscientist. I deal with how the brain works<br>
and (hopefully) how these processes produce our mental experiences and<br>
abilities. I'm also studying psychology, trying to learn as much as<br>
possible about the high-level phenomena of the mind so that I can work<br>
towards bridging the gap between neuron and mind.<br>
<p>
My posting was simply based on what we know of how cannabinoids affect<br>
the brain on a purely hardware level, fairly objective unless it turns<br>
out that the experiments were done in the wrong way or cannot be<br>
replicated. The problem with drug experiences (or for that matter a<br>
lot of our subjective experiences) is that they are highly unreliable<br>
- how much of the effects are real, and how much is just delusion?<br>
There are plenty of mechanisms that make us fool ourselves, especially<br>
when we are in unusual mental states (not that the normal state is<br>
delusion-free). A typical example would be a paranoid delusion - once<br>
you accept it partially it quickly makes you find more evidence for<br>
it, even if an outside person would say this evidence is weak or<br>
delusional. But to the paranoic, the persecution is experienced as<br>
real.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; I'm a long time smoker of hemp and find its effects very productive and</i><br>
<i>&gt; useful. I use it as a catalyst to encourage the sort of "flow" and</i><br>
<i>&gt; intuition that is at the root of my very best artwork. In fact, I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; speak for a large portion of the fine arts community and certainly an even</i><br>
<i>&gt; bigger segment of the music community that hemp is a powerful creative</i><br>
<i>&gt; catalyst.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How does that fit into your estimation of its function on the brain??</i><br>
<p>
Sounds reasonable. Note the similarities with the temporal lobe<br>
syndrome; many temporal lobe epileptics have been deeply creative or<br>
intuitive, cf. Dostoyevski or van Gogh (slightly debated, could be<br>
bipolar disorder instead). The hippocampus is likely involved in our<br>
context binding process and memory encoding. If it is affected by<br>
something, then we could expect that the normal bindings of context<br>
and experience are changed, which might influence creativity by making<br>
it more fluid. <br>
<p>
An interesting find I found on Medline (I haven't read it):<br>
"Undergraduate marijuana use as related to internal sensation novelty<br>
seeking and openness to experience" by Eisenman R, Grossman JC,<br>
Goldstein R J Clin Psychol 1980 Oct;36(4):1013-1019 says that "after 2<br>
years of use, expressed boredom with the environment decreased<br>
significantly". This supports my guess that cannabinoids make novelty<br>
detectors fire more. Another find on Medline supports the idea that<br>
associations become more fluid:<br>
<p>
Marijuana effects on associative processes.  Psychopharmacology (Berl)<br>
1985;85(4):426-430 Block RI, Wittenborn JR<br>
<p>
	Acute marijuana effects on associative processes involved in<br>
	long-term memory retrieval were studied. Results were<br>
	partially consistent with expectations based on previous<br>
	subjective reports that marijuana promotes more uncommon<br>
	associations. Marijuana altered responses when people gave as<br>
	many examples of a specified category (e.g., CLOTHING) as they<br>
	could for 2 min, and when they gave an example of a specified<br>
	category beginning with a specified letter (e.g., WEAPON -<br>
	G). Reaction time in the latter task and in prior studies was<br>
	not altered in the expected manner, a finding problematic for<br>
	some theoretic interpretations of marijuana's effects on<br>
	associative processes.<br>
<p>
In addition, the drug affects the basal ganglia. I'm not that familiar<br>
with them but they seem to be deeply involved in our planning and<br>
acting abilities, both by building up new behavior patterns and<br>
inhibiting patterns before they are to be used. If they are affected,<br>
then they might become less inhibiting, setting free new and unusual<br>
patterns that would otherwise have been suppressed.<br>
<p>
However, one should be careful to test these hypotheses. For example,<br>
the following paper did not find any increase in creativity:<br>
<p>
Marijuana effects on associations to novel stimuli.  J Nerv Ment Dis<br>
1978 May;166(5):362-364 Tinklenberg JR, Darley CF, Roth WT,<br>
Pfefferbaum A, Kopell BS<br>
<p>
	Sixteen college-educated male subjects were given an object<br>
	description task during placebo conditions and while<br>
	intoxicated with marijuana extract cookies calibrated to 0.3<br>
	mg/kg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, a dose within the range of<br>
	usual social use. The task was scored for fluency,<br>
	flexibility, elaboration, and uniqueness, all of which<br>
	represent associational thinking and are considered to be<br>
	components of creativity. Marijuana did not enhance any of<br>
	these measures.<br>
<p>
Something similar was reported in this paper, which instead suggests<br>
that it is the pleasant and social effects that are important:<br>
<p>
The effect of marijuana on small group process. Am J Drug Alcohol<br>
Abuse 1977;4(2):251-255 Salzman C, Kochansky GE, Van Der Kolk BA,<br>
Shader RI<br>
<p>
	In a research group setting, marijuana increased<br>
	social-emotional interpersonal communication and decreased<br>
	task-oriented behavior. Following a frustration stimulus,<br>
	groups of marijuana smokers appeared nonintoxicated and showed<br>
	improvement in consensus problem solving.  Interpersonal<br>
	behavior with marijuana may depend in part, on the presence or<br>
	absence of demand characteristics for task<br>
	performance. Creativity in group problem solving was not<br>
	improved by marijuana.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'll tell you why I'd like to think of hemp as a (pardon the cliché)</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhuman tool because at the root of my personal transition are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; creative ideas which forge and inspire my visions of a future culture. As</i><br>
<i>&gt; a technology artist, the cultural and technological speculation I make</i><br>
<i>&gt; about our world could eventually inspire its evolutionary direction. (not</i><br>
<i>&gt; that my ideas are changing the world, but look at philip k dick or other</i><br>
<i>&gt; visionary futurists) I'm not saying their process or mine depends on hemp,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but I'm sure that if you were to investigate why artists use hemp, they'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a similar opinion.</i><br>
<p>
A good point. Unfortunately the cannabinoids as they stand today seem<br>
to be rather crude tools for enhancing creativity. The studies above<br>
are not necessarily the last word, but they suggest that the<br>
cannabinoid induced creative experience may just a subjective<br>
experience of creativity, not something that actually produces more<br>
creative results (I admit that measuring creativity is at best hard<br>
and in itself somewhat subjective). We cannot trust our subjective<br>
experiences to reflect the objective world, we need to check them<br>
carefully.<br>
