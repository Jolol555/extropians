<i>&gt;&gt; terminology there could be other universes, and in fact we read about</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "baby universes", "basement universes", etc.  Sometimes people then use</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; terms like "multiverse" or "omniverse" or other coinages to refer to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the collection of all the universes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; If you want to reserve "universe" to mean all that there is, then you</i><br>

<i>&gt;The problem with these multiple universe theories is that I know of no way</i><br>
they <br>

<i>&gt;Therefore, I assume that the "universe" and the four dimensional</i><br>
space-time we live <br>
<i>&gt;in are one and the same. However, whether everything there is includes other </i><br>
<i>&gt;universes or just the one we can observe, the fact remains that the</i><br>
universe or <br>
<i>&gt;universes are/is the result of (a) quantum fluctuation(s).</i><br>

I did not understand why so many doubts !!!  Just remember the *simple<br>
math* definition of universe :<br>
<p>
           "the complete set of all". <br>
<p>
 So:<br>
<p>
<p>
1. Doesn't matter if an object, even if abstract,  is "something(t)" (time<br>
variant) ... ( do not tell me there is anyone here who only conceive sets<br>
of static  concrete objects... )<br>
<p>
2. If you can imagine anything *out of*  such universe, defined in the<br>
above way, you have not understood the definition...&gt;&gt; it is impossible "by<br>
definition" !!! ( or so remember: which is  the complementary set of the<br>
universe? &gt;&gt; { } ,  the empty set...) <br>
<p>
3. Any  set is always  a part of the universe (including { } and the<br>
universe itself)...<br>

PS1: sorry for the boring repetition of basic school notions... but...  <br>
PS2: the mathematical language is not just for mathematics... (sorry again<br>
to those who already know the obviousness and importance of this...) <br>
PS3: there are some concepts that instead of trying to adapt them to your<br>
knowledge, first do adapt your knowledge to them... obs: it's not valid for<br>
religious definitions... ;-|D  !!<br>
