That makes two of us. (Although I tend to think in terms of altruism as<br>
usually being a Good Thing, at least towards those who hold the same<br>
opinion towards me, and act that way.)<br>
<p>
Of course, this approach can cover a multitude of conflicting viewpoints ...<br>
          <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;"government BAD,  free market GOOD". </i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;Explain that to diabetics who can't get reasonably priced medical        </i><br>

<i>&gt; Reasonably priced? You mean explain why everybody can not always receive  </i><br>
<i>&gt; medical benefits that are more expensive than the premiums they pay? I think </i><br>
<i>&gt; it's sufficient to say that you can't get something for nothing. </i><br>
<p>
Quite true. However, the whole point of insurance is _collective_ risk<br>
cover -- from the customer's point of view. From the insurer's point of<br>
view it's to make a profit by maximizing the return on money while <br>
minimizing payouts. So there's a built-in conflict of interests.<br>
<p>
Now, at this point the market is supposed to come into play, wave a<br>
magic wand, and Make Everything Work Optimally. At least, that the official<br>
truth I keep hearing from libertarians. (Warning: I Am Not A Libertarian --<br>
although I have more sympathy for libertarian social ideals than for<br>
conventional political ones).<br>
           <br>
<i>&gt; Exactly. If diabetics pay less than they should then non diabetics will have </i><br>
<i>&gt; to pay more.</i><br>
<p>
That's the 'market knows best' answer. I am not happy with it. It<br>
subordinates ethics to market realities. (The ethical viewpoint being<br>
"everybody should have access to equal treatment, in an ideal world" and<br>
the market viewpoint being "you get what you pays for".) While it's<br>
inarguably a description of a current state of affairs, it's not an<br>
ideal state (which would probably be: nobody gets diabetes, grows old,<br>
dies, or needs insurance in the first place) or even an optimal<br>
one (everybody can afford insurance). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;The market is good at looking after local problems. It's complete         </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;crap at predicting the future</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And politicians good at predicting the future?</i><br>
 <br>
No. A screamingly obvious hole in our knowledge is how to reason under<br>
conditions of uncertainty. There's no rigorous methodology available<br>
for doing so (although 20/20 hindsight, in the form of Bayes' theorem,<br>
comes in handy).<br>
<p>
But I maintain -- the market is simply a mechanism for adjusting<br>
resource imbalances on a local scale. One thing I notice a lot of<br>
libertarians do is idealise the concept of the market, turning it into<br>
a holy cow of economic dogma: as if the market is the _only_ way of<br>
allocating resources.<br>
<p>
It's a lot better than, say, Soviet-style central planning. But it's<br>
got weaknesses, and I'm fairly certain that better resource allocation<br>
algorithms exist, if only we are smart enough to identify them. What<br>
constitutes a better resource allocation algorithm? Any way of reconciling <br>
supply and demand that isn't vulnerable to the production and manipulation<br>
of monopolies, doesn't encourage its core functional units to become Feudal <br>
dictatorships -- corporation mini-states -- and encourages cooperative,<br>
as opposed to defective, use of common resources. Oh, and it also needs<br>
to encourage cooperation non-coercively, not by being a free market with<br>
a coercive regulatory mechanism bolted on top of it.  (In other words:<br>
a system that encourages mutually beneficial exchanges and discourages<br>
zero-sum games. Fun, huh?)<br>
            <br>
<i>&gt; The tragedy of the commons is just that, a tragedy, and unfortunately no </i><br>
<i>&gt; system has a solution for it. </i><br>
<p>
That's what I'm banging on about (above). Just because no system has<br>
solved the problem, it does not follow that it is insoluble. And I see<br>
a lot of extropian/libertarian thinkers seeming to blandly ignore it,<br>
instead of fixing the defect. (The day some libertarian thinker dreams<br>
up a non-coercive economic system that is not susceptive to the tragedy<br>
of the commons is the day I become a libertarian.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is no compelling reason why government </i><br>
<i>&gt; should engage in projects that help most people most of the time, it's much </i><br>
<i>&gt; more likely that they'd do things that help a very few people a lot but is</i><br>
<i>&gt; slightly harmful to most. When the number of projects becomes large the harm </i><br>
<i>&gt; is no longer slight.</i><br>
 <br>
There are exceptions. I live in the UK, where we have a national health<br>
system. It's underfunded -- but then, we don't pay much for it; about<br>
US $1000 per taxpayer-year that covers everything from antibiotics to<br>
heart transplants. The advantage it has over the US system is that there's<br>
no insurance industry; treatment is free at the point of demand, so <br>
none of your healthcare budget is diverted into the insurance company's<br>
back pocket. The disadvantage is that demand is potentially infinite --<br>
leading to shortages. Ultimately an equilibrium is reached: I don't go<br>
and pester my doctor about trivia because I know there's a long queue.<br>
On the other hand, if I need emergency surgery in a hurry, nobody's<br>
going to waste time asking if I've got insurance. The system's not<br>
without shortcomings, but it's worked for more than fifty years on a<br>
massive scale (annual budget around US $50 billion), so I'll assert<br>
that it _is_ possible for a government to undertake a project of general<br>
benefit to all its citizens [once in fifty years].<br>
        <br>
<i>&gt; Suppose I want to make $10,000,  there are two ways to go about it. I can </i><br>
<i>&gt; work to repeal hundreds of special interest laws, each one costing me a few </i><br>
<i>&gt; dollars, or I can lobby for the passage of one more special interest law that </i><br>
<i>&gt; will give me and my friends $10,000 and cost everybody else a dollar or two. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The second method makes much more sense, it's far easier to pass one law than </i><br>
<i>&gt; to repeal hundreds .</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This sort of lobbying won't work in the free market. If I want an executive   </i><br>
<i>&gt; at Microsoft to be promoted to a position of greater power there is only one  </i><br>
<i>&gt; thing I can do to help that come about, purchase the product that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; executive has been advocating. Bribery will help the executive's bank </i><br>
<i>&gt; account but it will not help his chances for advancement, it will hurt it</i><br>
<i>&gt; because his boss will note that his decisions have been poor and do not made </i><br>
<i>&gt; economic sense.  The stockholders will note the same thing.</i><br>
<p>
Alternative: a political system that is not amenable to bribery,<br>
nepotism, or corruption and that follows the old dictum of kings that <br>
"he who rules best, rules least". But that's another matter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And since that time "useful government" has created a sea of blood. It  </i><br>
<i>&gt; mystifies me when people go on and on about how evil corporations are, </i><br>
<i>&gt; yes Microsoft can be arrogant and yes, it makes me mad when Windows crashes </i><br>
<i>&gt; too, but at least Bill Gates doesn't shove his customers into ovens.</i><br>
 <br>
Does Windows crash? I wouldn't know -- I don't let it near any of my PC's.<br>
;-)<br>
