8. ON QUANTUM THEORY WITHOUT OBSERVERS<br>
One of the fundamental questions of physics is whether pure<br>
states (i.e., states undisturbed by avoidable noise) are states<br>
such that the outcome of every measurement can be exactly<br>
predicted. Classical physics is based on the proposition that the<br>
answer to the question is yes. Orthodox quantum mechanics is a<br>
theory based on the proposition that the answer is no, and that<br>
we can only make precise quantitative statements about probab-<br>
ilities, the limitation due to an essential interaction between<br>
the observer and that which is being measured.<br>
.. ... S. Goldstein (Rutgers University New Brunswick, US), in<br>
the first of a two-part review, discusses the idea of quantum<br>
theory without observers, and suggests that despite the claims of<br>
most of the originators of quantum theory, the appeal at a fund-<br>
amental level to observers and measurement, which is so prominent<br>
in orthodox quantum theory, is not needed to account for quantum<br>
phenomena. Referring to the classical Bohr-Einstein debate,<br>
Goldstein says the debate has already been resolved in favor of<br>
Einstein. What Einstein desired and Bohr held impossible -- an<br>
observer-free formulation of quantum mechanics in which the<br>
process of measurement can be analyzed in terms of more fund-<br>
amental concepts, does in fact exist, and there are many such<br>
formulations, several of which have the potential to become a<br>
serious program for the construction of a quantum theory without<br>
observers. QY: Sheldon Goldstein, Rutgers University New<br>
