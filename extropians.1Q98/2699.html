<p>
<p>
Exactly, preventing future crime is the only reason for punishment, or at <br>
least the only reason I would care to defend. My point was that if you're <br>
going to kill a murderer anyway then you can be sure he will never kill again <br>
so there is no purpose in torturing him before you do so. <br>
<p>
Ok, an argument could be made about increasing the deterrent, but this effect <br>
may not exist (it would probably just generate sympathy in the population for<br>
the murderer and make him a martyr) however even if it did and the effect was <br>
proven to be large I still wouldn't go for it because emotional revulsion <br>
against torture would prevent me. Hey, I never said I was a paragon of logic.<br>

<i>        &gt;insurmountable problem, but it is never taken into account.         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Calibrating physical effects, such as tiredness and pain, is        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;extremely easy compared to that. So by your very argument, we should         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;abandon all other types of punishment in favor of the corporal.</i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
Tiredness and pain are psychological perceptions, heart failure, shock, and <br>
massive blood loss are physical effects. You'd be giving one person a mild <br>
irritation, a second person a lifelong crippling injury, and a third person a <br>
death sentence, and all for committing the exact same crime.<br>
