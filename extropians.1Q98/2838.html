Ah, so you are referring to a central banking system as the point of<br>
central 'control'. This is an accurate assessment.<br>
<p>
However, it is not apparent that this is a 'bad' thing, at least not<br>
currently. As the 1920's demonstrated, failing to impose any form of<br>
negative feedback on a system will cause that system to quickly cycle out<br>
of control as any competent engineer can tell you (like oversteer on a<br>
truck steering system). Currently, there are no large scale natural forms<br>
of negative fedback that can effectively counteract the hysterical/panic<br>
tendencies of individuals engaging in trade in a commodity level market.<br>
This was why the SEC, the Reserve System, and other controls were imposed<br>
back then in the wake of the Crash, and why there are currently controls<br>
on computerized trading. You might ask how a computer can get hysterical?<br>
If it is programmed to reproduce the same trading behaviors that a<br>
hysterical trader would take, it can act 'hysterical' at least in a<br>
trading sense..<br>
<p>
One natural form with the potential to act as negative feedback is open<br>
information. As Robin Hansen has discussed previously, two trading agents<br>
both operating with perfect knowledge of  all elements in a trade<br>
invariably come to an accurate valuation and price for the item of trade.<br>
When there is imperfect information, the agents will attempt to operate<br>
as such Bayesian traders, but the less accurate the information available<br>
is, the extrapolations and expectations of the respective traders will<br>
tend to diverge, leading to a speculative market. The more speculative a<br>
market is, the more likely it is to succumb to the sort of buying<br>
hysterias and selling panics that can be seen in many markets that<br>
protect the secrecy of information that is relevant to a trade.<br>
<p>
This situation is analogous to the sort of circumstances which lead to<br>
armed conflict. Military historians generally agree that wars occur when<br>
two potential adversaries with a point of conflict cannot agree on who<br>
holds the superior military position/numbers.<br>
<p>
Back to the money system though. Alan Greenspan, a noted Randite<br>
currently running the Federal Reserve Board, has stated that he can<br>
forsee circumstances in which entities like the Federal Reserve will no<br>
longer be necessary. We can assume that this will involve the<br>
availability of computing capabilities which enable one trader to develop<br>
an extremely accurate estimate of the opposing traders information based<br>
on only a small sampling of information.  When this occurs, secrecy in<br>
financial transactions between parties, and fraud as a result, will<br>
become extremely difficult to perpetrate. This sort of technology will<br>
also be usable as information 'veradicators' which can assess the<br>
accuracy of any given point of information, to determine whether that<br>
information is truthful or merely disinformation.<br>
<p>
This sort of technology will also apply to your proposals for "One True<br>
Open Network", in that you will not need to keep constant surveillance of<br>
everyone. The small discrepancies will give away the lie. While we as<br>
humans today might not catch the contradictions inherent in such minor<br>
information, given time, such information veradication systems will act<br>
as our spies, without violating anothers privacy. How? Say you go into a<br>
closed room. Such information veradication systems will be able to<br>
accurately estimate what you were doing in that room based on your<br>
actions prior to entry and  following your exit from the room. They would<br>
not necessarily need to know exactly what you did there, but based on<br>
what the system does know about you, it can come to a rather accurate<br>
conclusion as to what you were doing there, and conduct tests to<br>
determine its accuracy.<br>
