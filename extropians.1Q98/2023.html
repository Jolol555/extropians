<p>
I don't know about you, but many of us have chosen their goals quite early<br>
in life. I cannot claim speaking for the others, but my interest in<br>
certain technologies, physical/chemical sciencies and computer modelling<br>
has certainly not been caused by reading Diamond Age. In fact it goes back<br>
to the early childhood. Many influential movers &amp; shakers (just to name<br>
Minsky, Moravec, Tipler, Drexler, Merkle, de Garis, ...) share our memetic<br>
set, whether formally or de facto. Their 'everyday life' is certainly<br>
having nontrivial impact. I honestly cannot assess how much the<br>
Extropians/transhumanists as a bulk can contribute to the bleeding edge in<br>
science/technology/memefection, but yes, it does seem like a worthwhile<br>
goal to pursue.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; [ making it through the Singularity is challenging enough ]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless transhumanists get somehow organized the chances that any of</i><br>
<i>&gt; us will make it past singularity are close to zero; the powers that be will</i><br>
<i>&gt; crush us all like worms. Only (some of) the rich and powerful are going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make it.</i><br>
<p>
Having a single friend High Above should suffice. (And a little redundancy<br>
won't hurt).  Becoming one of the rich &amp; powerful should thus not be a<br>
minor point on the transhumanist agenda.  If you are so smart then why<br>
ain't you rich? Why, indeed? <br>

<i>&gt; I'm sure the Exclave is a lot of fun, but hardly comparable to a sovereign</i><br>
<i>&gt; country...</i><br>
<p>
The Exclave is the best model we currently have (and no, I don't know<br>
anything about it). If the synergisms due to physical interactions are not<br>
mythical, they should be observable there. But: with a realtime broadband<br>
channel even socializing shouldn't suffer too much. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; No-one said it's *easy*, but it doesn't take a superhuman effort either. Others</i><br>
<i>&gt; have done it, so why can't we?</i><br>
<p>
What have they gained by it? What focuses have they neglected by gaining<br>
it? What was the empirical critical resource threshold in their efforts to<br>
be successul? See?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Unless a full-blown neoludd witchhunt is on (then</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The neoluddites are an insignificant bunch of morons, and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; the real problem. Organized crime and governments on the other</i><br>
<p>
Tell that Gelernter, who has had his hands blown off by the Unabomber. An<br>
insignificant moron who is also a fairly competent molecular virologist is<br>
not longer so very insignificant in terms of the damage. A petty terrorist<br>
taking out 50 leading ExI heads + guest speakers by a fertilizer/fuel<br>
carbomb is not so very petty anymore, I am afraid. Even if the risk be<br>
small it is not zero.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; hand...</i><br>
<p>
Organized crime is not that a large problem as I have learned from most<br>
recent observations (caution: sample size bias). (Interesting enough that<br>
the same picture painted by your favourite lillywhite monopoly always<br>
winds up such a bugbear). Street thugs are not a problem, a minimum of<br>
streetsmartness assuming (Btw, I am not armed for the police is a<br>
significantly higher danger here), and higher echelons are<br>
indistinguishable from state.  They are interested in milking, not killing<br>
you. Remember, the state _is_ the mafia here. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; A lot of small nuisances still can make life miserable. Instead of enduring </i><br>
<i>&gt; decades of paying taxes, filling out forms for every stupid thing, waiting periods,</i><br>
<i>&gt; legal injustice, petty crime and all the other crap that's related to our societies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can focus on one major effort, and reap the fruits for many years to come.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A private nation is an investment that can ultimately save you a lot of money</i><br>
<i>&gt; and frustration. It's the embodyment of personal freedom and responsibility.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, I believe you that you believe that, but it does sound a lot like<br>
propaganda to me. You obviously do not see the simple virtues of careful<br>
realism. You wouldn't believe how many things how soon a bunch of<br>
energetic bright individualists can scrogg up. This _can_ be rewarding<br>
learning experience on its own, agreed. Just count me out. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course things can go wrong, but then again you can also lose your job</i><br>
<i>&gt; and be unable to get another one, for example. Life is a risk, no matter what</i><br>
<i>&gt; you do. </i><br>
<p>
Life is a risk, and yes, it does matter what you do.<br>

<i>&gt; Aren't all kinds of virtual activities best conducted from a safe haven with your</i><br>
<i>&gt; own sandy beach and waving palms? ;) For some very lucrative business like</i><br>
<p>
I am not particular to sandy beaches &amp; waving palms. From what I know I<br>
could be living with friends in a renovated country farm in Normandy a<br>
decade from now. Brodband wireless links should be cheap enough by then. <br>
If all you do is pushing bits around the location doesn't really matter<br>
that much. Of course, this won't work for anybody. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; new designer drugs (the "grey area" kind that's not yet universally</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognized as illegal) and virtual porn (apart from kids just about</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything goes) and world lotteries and other gambling activities</i><br>
<i>&gt; (virtual or otherwise) a distant retreat is highly recommended. Money &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt; fun in the sun, what else could you want? </i><br>
<p>
I think yours is a remarkably cynic perspective. Remember, we are all<br>
supposed to be sheep in wolf's clothing here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; [ don't put all your eggs in one basket ]</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think you're a lot safer on your private island than in a big city, for example,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and *should* someone try to bother you (which is unlikely if you keep a </i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonably low profile) you have at least the means to defend yourself </i><br>
<i>&gt; (your budget is the only limit). </i><br>
<p>
I am unlikely to find myself at the receiving end of a tactical nuke or a<br>
bunch of marines on the streets of a city. Besides, the average city is<br>
way too dangerous/expensive/polluted to remain enjoyable on the mid run<br>
anyway. You mileage may vary. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; [ personally demonstrate efficieny of your memecluster ]</i><br>
<i>&gt; What's the alternative plan, then?</i><br>
<p>
1) Make money 2) Donate some of it for worthwhile purposes (ExI would be<br>
an instance) 3) reiterate above until you've run into the Singularity or<br>
suddenly realize you are floating in a liquid nitrogen Dewar. Really<br>
simple, and unspectacular, eh?<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; [ run &amp; hide, as soon as you can ]</i><br>
<i>&gt; How do autistic fugitives get access to the first body enhancers/upload devices?</i><br>
<p>
If you can do it, sailing off in subluminal ecosystem bubbles is a lot<br>
better than being gobbled up by a DIY Blight. Being old-fashioned, I<br>
believe in simple virtues such as personal survival. Certain flavours of<br>
Blight are not only omniscient and omnipotent, but also omnivorous.<br>
