Yes, since past injustices are probably piled up pretty high in every<br>
direction, the best thing to do to start off a libertarian society is<br>
just START ENFORCING PROPERTY RIGHTS (equally for all) PROPERLY NOW, and<br>
provided they are rigorously adhered to from this moment on, the (Pareto?)<br>
optimal result will come about.  (Meaning, basically, keep politics the<br>
fuck out of economics, except for reasons with a *much* higher<br>
"threshold" than are tolerated now.)<br>

This is what's always struck me about Marx's conversion from classical<br>
liberalism to socialism.  The pro-propertied bias he experienced in the<br>
legal system was an example not of liberalism working itself out but of<br>
liberal principles not being adhered to.  He must have already had an<br>
*emotional* bee in his bonnet for such a weak reason to turn him.<br>
