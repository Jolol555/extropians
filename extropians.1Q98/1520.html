Personally I think this whole idea of an 'age of consent' (that noone is<br>
able to give consent until one particular day of their lives and that<br>
anyone can give consent afterwards) is one more ancient myth we need to<br>
eliminate. I like the libertarian idea that's been posted here before;<br>
any 'child' who can prove to a court that they are able to make their<br>
own decisions should be treated as an adult from that time onwards, <br>
regardless of age. Seems pretty clear, simple and flexible to me.<br>

Unless being treated as a kid when you're perfectly able to handle life<br>
by yourself screws you up so much that you need years to recover. <br>
