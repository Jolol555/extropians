<i>&gt; &gt;(concurrently with being among the lowest 5 states in terms of per capita</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;business climates in the US. [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Best of all, we also have the lowest unemployment rate in the US, at less</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;2%.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And the low crime rate is due to... which of these parameters?</i><br>
<p>
probably a combination of the high education and the high level of gun posession,<br>
and ease of use as concealed weapons. Vermont is even more liberal on this, you<br>
don't need any kind of permit at all there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do NH teachers force their students to study at the point of a gun?  Do NH</i><br>
<i>&gt; workers negotiate their jobs at the point of a gun?</i><br>
<p>
Not at all, however anyone who has had a chance to shoot guns can comment on what<br>
an empowering experience it is. People who live lives afraid of everything,<br>
especially guns, can go through a rather marked change once they have overcome<br>
one big fear, like the fear of guns. I would say that the culture-wide use of<br>
guns here generates a sort of common feeling of empowerment and self reliance.<br>
People here take part in town meetings, school boards, and their kids<br>
extracurricular activities, they don't just drop them off like at a baby sitter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Or is violent crime elsewhere perhaps correlated with other factors that</i><br>
<i>&gt; also damage education and employment rates, creating a vicious cycle?</i><br>
<p>
Hardly, most states and cities that have high crime rates had severe gun control<br>
laws long before, when education and employment prospects in those areas was<br>
still excellent. Employment goes down when crime rates push businesses to<br>
relocate to places more conducive to a decent lifestyle for their workers.I am<br>
using NH as an example of a state which is as close to a libertarian optimum as<br>
one can currently find in the industrialized world, and how all stats indicating<br>
a 'livable' environment seem to be far above that in any other industrialized<br>
polity I am aware of. Various socialist sympathizers here have expressed<br>
disbeleif that such a system could result in anything but chaos, as they have no<br>
faith in the ability of the common man to desire to live peacefully. New<br>
Hampshire's health and vitality is testament to the wrongness of their<br>
assumptions and conclusions.<br>
