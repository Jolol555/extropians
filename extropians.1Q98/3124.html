          <br>
<p>
I don't think factoring would be the best test of a Quantum Computer for 3 <br>
reasons: <br>
<p>
1) Factoring is one of the most demanding tasks you could ask a quantum    <br>
  computer to do.     <br>
  <br>
2) As you point out, with a 50 bit number cheating is possible with a    <br>
   conventional computer.<br>
<p>
3) It's dull, even if you're able to do it the world will not be changed much. <br>
<p>
Rather than factoring a 50 bit number try simulating the behavior of 50  <br>
objects, like the 50 electrons in a tin atom. That would change the world big <br>
time, yet surprisingly it would be much easier to get a quantum computer to <br>
do that than factor numbers. There is no way a conventional computer could <br>
perform such a simulation, that's why Chemists must still do experiments. <br>
To simulate the behavior of N electrons, in a conventional computer you would <br>
need memory space and computation time proportional to 2^2N. To figure out <br>
from theory alone what's going on with a tin atom you  would need to perform <br>
about 10^30 operations. <br>
 <br>
Seth Lloyd found a way to perform the same simulation using just N qubits and  <br>
the number of operations the quantum machine must do is proportional to N, <br>
not 2^2N as on a conventional computer. In addition, the time required to do <br>
the simulation over time t is proportional to t, in other words it can do it<br>
in real time, like an Analog computer. Lloyd's simulation method is far more <br>
forgiving and less sensitive to errors than Shor's factoring algorithm, and <br>
astronomically more useful.<br>
<p>
If you don't like tin how about calculating the freezing point of water from<br>
the laws of Quantum Mechanics? There is lots more about this in a article in <br>
the August 23 1996 issue of Science by Seth Lloyd called  "Universal Quantum<br>
Simulators".  <br>
