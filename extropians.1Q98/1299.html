Actually, that's exactly the kind I prefer to eat. Of course, I prefer to<br>
eat the ones I don't get along with (when I was growing up, my bro and I<br>
noticed that it was always the troublemaker steer that Dad decided we'd<br>
keep for the family's freezer (he always denied this, of course ;) ).<br>
<p>
Compared to what I am presented with in the grocer's, the livestock we<br>
raised was better treated, the meat was leaner, more flavorful and healthy,<br>
and I had a more direct experience of, and respect for, the eternal cycle<br>
of life and death.<br>
<p>
And I guess that tells you where I stand on the omnivorous scale...<br>
