We can?  What local governments are you thinking of?  For the US I<br>
associate the term with cities, or at best states.  I haven't noticed<br>
the Internet undermining these, or them attempting to restrict<br>
information.  California is moving to embrace the Internet, which may<br>
allow for stronger and better government through greater<br>
accountability.<br>

Elsewhere... it'd be nice for China to collapse, but it has yet to<br>
happen.<br>
