<i>|FOR LIFE, LIBERTY AND PROPERTY</i><br>
<i>|____________________________________________________________________</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Government spending is going through the roof in western countries.</i><br>
<i>|All technological and other advance is proving vain, for government</i><br>
<i>|spending is growing so fast that its proportion of total output is</i><br>
<i>|becoming a crushing burden. In Western Europe thirty years ago,</i><br>
<i>|government spending averaged out at about 25% of output. Now it is</i><br>
<i>|about 50%, and rising fast. If this trend continues economic advance</i><br>
<i>|will be so undermined that economic collapse will occur.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|PUBLIC CHOICE</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Why is this happening? The popular answer, among libertarians, is</i><br>
<i>|the Public Choice Theory answer that groups of people - "special</i><br>
<i>|interests" - benefit a lot per head from a particular item of</i><br>
<i>|government spending, whereas the general population are not hurt</i><br>
<i>|much per head.(1)</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|If one hundred men benefit to the tune of one thousand pounds each</i><br>
<i>|from the building of a warship, they have a big incentive to</i><br>
<i>|campaign like mad, in public and by private lobbying, for this</i><br>
<i>|warship. But the tens of millions of voters are hardly hurt at all</i><br>
<i>|by the few pence each voter is forced to spend on this warship, so</i><br>
<i>|they have no incentive even to find out that the money is being</i><br>
<i>|spent, let alone to stop it being spent.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|So people press for the government spending that benefits them. The</i><br>
<i>|concentrated interests win at the expense of the diffuse general</i><br>
<i>|interest.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|At first sight this seems a very good description of political</i><br>
<i>|activity. I remember from University days the antics of small groups</i><br>
<i>|of people which it was not worth the trouble of most students to</i><br>
<i>|oppose, as, per head, the demands of each group cost them little.</i><br>
<i>|And in local and national politics one seems to come across nothing</i><br>
<i>|but an endless series of groups asking for more money for their</i><br>
<i>|particular activity.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|However, I believe the Public Choice view to be fundamentally</i><br>
<i>|flawed. It does not fit the facts. For if Public Choice Theory is</i><br>
<i>|true, why do some items of government spending fall as a percentage</i><br>
<i>|of output over time, and others rise?</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|In the United States in 1960, defence spending was 12.1% of total</i><br>
<i>|output and federal welfare spending (pensions, unemployment benefit,</i><br>
<i>|etc.) was 4.8%. In 1980 defence spending was 7.3% of total output</i><br>
<i>|and federal welfare was 12.6%.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|The wholehearted supporter of Public Choice might say that this is</i><br>
<i>|because more people believe that welfare spending will benefit them</i><br>
<i>|than believe that defence spending will. But the whole point of the</i><br>
<i>|libertarian economic case is that such things as the surge of "Great</i><br>
<i>|Society" welfare programs benefit no one with the possible exception</i><br>
<i>|of the people who administer them, that such spending increases the</i><br>
<i>|very poverty it is supposed to reduce.(2)</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|BELIEFS</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|If we are to believe that the reason welfare spending went up and</i><br>
<i>|defence spending down was that more people believed that it would</i><br>
<i>|benefit them, this begs the question of why the welfare bureaucrats</i><br>
<i>|and their allies were more successful than the defence bureaucrats</i><br>
<i>|and their allies in persuading people that more spending was in</i><br>
<i>|their interests. There is no evidence that the vast majority of</i><br>
<i>|voters in the U.S., let alone the politicians who actually voted for</i><br>
<i>|them, believed they would ever use any of the Great Society welfare</i><br>
<i>|programs (it is different in the case of 'Social Security' pensions</i><br>
<i>|of course) they were voting against their interests.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|I know of no western country, over the last thirty years, which had</i><br>
<i>|large scale defence spending where its share of output has not</i><br>
<i>|fallen and I know of no western country where welfare spending share</i><br>
<i>|of output has not risen and is not continuing to rise. In the United</i><br>
<i>|States the defence burden is less and the welfare burden is greater</i><br>
<i>|than it was in 1980. Overall Federal spending in the United States</i><br>
<i>|is now about 35% of output. In 1928, it was 3% of output.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Such things as the road spending burden, by contrast, show no</i><br>
<i>|tendency to increase over time, in spite of having large scale</i><br>
<i>|interests behind them, who are able to make plausible (however</i><br>
<i>|false) claims that the mass of voters, as well as special groups of</i><br>
<i>|voters and campaign contributors, benefit from such spending.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Government transport spending, subsidies to industry, agriculture,</i><br>
<i>|the arts, whatever you wish to name none of these show the dramatic</i><br>
<i>|rise that welfare spending does in every western country from the</i><br>
<i>|day welfare schemes are introduced.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Partly, this is because these schemes increase the number of poor</i><br>
<i>|people, which in turn leads to even more welfare spending. It is</i><br>
<i>|like the rolling of a snowball down a steep slope.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|But it is not just this. If government spending on health,</i><br>
<i>|education, child care, the old, and so forth, is perceived as</i><br>
<i>|helping the poor resistance to it is fatally weakened.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|"Conservative" election victories are no counter argument</i><br>
<i>|"Conservative" governments increase welfare spending. (As British</i><br>
<i>|Prime Minister John Major said: "We have spent more than Labour even</i><br>
<i>|promised to spend.") Even if we assume that, for example, in the</i><br>
<i>|1992 British general election everyone who voted Conservative</i><br>
<i>|opposed higher welfare spending (which is nonsense) 57% of the</i><br>
<i>|voters supported a rise in the welfare state burden. And Britain is</i><br>
<i>|without doubt the least pro-welfare state country in the EEC.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|WHAT IS TO BE DONE?</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|I do not believe politicians (at least, British Conservative Party</i><br>
<i>|politicians, who are the only ones I know) to be in the main the</i><br>
<i>|vote obsessed figures of Public Choice Theory, nor do I believe that</i><br>
<i>|the main problem is that they are deceived by special interest</i><br>
<i>|groups. Politicians have beliefs. The trouble is that their beliefs</i><br>
<i>|are the same as those of most other people. The politicians believe</i><br>
<i>|that the ever growing welfare state is morally good - 'holy', if you</i><br>
<i>|will.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Well, we could try to persuade them that it is morally bad. I</i><br>
<i>|believe that part of what Michael Oakeshott tries to do in some of</i><br>
<i>|his writings(3) is to show that there are different traditions, and</i><br>
<i>|that by an unthinking acceptance of the planning, state activist</i><br>
<i>|tradition, of which the welfare state is part, we more away from the</i><br>
<i>|tradition of "civil society", which he believes that we also value.</i><br>
<i>|Ayn Rand tries to show that the dominant welfare state is against</i><br>
<i>|the whole nature of man.(4)</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|The trouble is that neither of these approaches, of arguing that</i><br>
<i>|government welfare spending increases poverty, and arguing that it</i><br>
<i>|destroys civil society, has worked, or shows any sign of working.</i><br>
<i>|There is one approach left, which is to point out and ram home again</i><br>
<i>|and again, by all the means we can find, that the ever growing</i><br>
<i>|welfare state will lead to economic collapse. And I do mean true</i><br>
<i>|collapse. Eventually, unrestrained welfare spending will lead to</i><br>
<i>|mass starvation.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Many have pointed this out, notably Rand. But in her case, this</i><br>
<i>|argument was part of a whole philosophy.(5) We have never had the</i><br>
<i>|simple message pounded away constantly. Now is the time to do this.</i><br>
<i>|Over the next few years the great slide will become clearly</i><br>
<i>|apparent, and the longer genuine action is put off the greater the</i><br>
<i>|horror will be, as there will be more and more poor people. As the</i><br>
<i>|economy slides, so, I believe will civility. There will be demands</i><br>
<i>|for 'emergency action', which will of course only make things worse.</i><br>
<i>|But if just one major country manages to turn its back on welfare</i><br>
<i>|statism, it will become an example.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|The failure of welfare statism will at first probably lead to more</i><br>
<i>|welfare statism, decline to more decline. But if we talk and write</i><br>
<i>|enough, we may be listened to. The hangman's noose concentrates the</i><br>
<i>|mind wonderfully, and with things visibly falling apart we will</i><br>
<i>|never have a better chance.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|If we succeed, then human beings cooperating together, free of</i><br>
<i>|seeing all that they do being taxed, borrowed and printed away to</i><br>
<i>|finance the welfare state, and free too of the maze of regulation</i><br>
<i>|that go with the welfare state, will accomplish great things.</i><br>

<i>|NOTES</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|1. Those interested in the complexities of Public Choice theory</i><br>
<i>|might start with James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, The Calculus</i><br>
<i>|of Consent, University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1962. But there</i><br>
<i>|are many other works by Nobel Laureate Buchanan, by the more</i><br>
<i>|'extreme' Tullock, and by their many followers. See for example</i><br>
<i>|Gordon Tullock, The Vote Motive, Hobart Paperback No. 4, Institute</i><br>
<i>|of Economic Affairs, London, 1976; or J. M. Buchanan et al., The</i><br>
<i>|Economics of Politics, Readings No.18, Institute of Economic</i><br>
<i>|Affairs, London, 1978. A nice recent book of essays is Democracy and</i><br>
<i>|Public Choice: Essays in Honour of Gordon Tullock, edited with</i><br>
<i>|contributions by Charles K. Rowley, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1987.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|2. See for example Charles A. Murray, Losing Ground: American Social</i><br>
<i>|Policy 1950-80, Basic Books, New York, 1984; or Henry Hazlitt, The</i><br>
<i>|Conquest of Poverty, Arlington House, New Rochelle, New York, 1971;</i><br>
<i>|or John Rospers, Libertarianism, Nash, Los Angeles, 1971, especially</i><br>
<i>|chapter 7, "Welfare and Government". But there are so many hooks and</i><br>
<i>|articles by so many authors.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|3. For example see "On Being Conservative" in Rationalism in</i><br>
<i>|Politics, Methuen, 1962; or the whole of Oakeshott's On Human</i><br>
<i>|Conduct, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1975-1990, particularly the second</i><br>
<i>|and third essays.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|4. The obvious example is Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged, New American</i><br>
<i>|Library, New York, 1957.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|5. I am not saying Rand's philosophy is right or wrong, only that it</i><br>
<i>|is not simple. It is concerned with how we live, and not just</i><br>
<i>|whether we will live.</i><br>
