<i>&gt;Hey harvey, here is some from your header:</i><br>
<i>&gt;To:  extropians@extropy.com, extropians@maxwell.kumo.com</i><br>
<i>&gt;You're still sending out doubles.</i><br>
<p>
Damn!  I know it and I apologize.  It's really frustrating that I can't use<br>
my a regular reply to the Extropians List, like I can to other mailing<br>
lists.  Can't anybody figure out how to fix the List so we Jupiter brains<br>
don't have to edit the headers on messages from the List before we reply to<br>
them?<br>
<p>
It is not the original poster's software that is adding the duplicating<br>
addresses.  In this case they sent the message only to<br>
"extropians@maxwell.kumo.com".  It is not the replyer's software which is<br>
adding the duplicate addresses.  In this case, I simply hit "Reply", and it<br>
replied to the two addresses that are already listed in the headers.  It is<br>
the List software which is adding the extra "Reply To:<br>
extropians@extropy.com" to the message which already had "To:<br>
extropians@extropy.com".  This makes it appear that there are two addresses<br>
that can be replied to, but really they go to the same place.<br>
<p>
If you look closely at the "duplicates", you will see that they are<br>
addressed to different addresses.  No software in the world can know that<br>
these two differently-seeming addresses are really the same destination.<br>
In my opinion, the List software should not add duplicate reply addresses<br>
in this manner.  The List software should choose to remove the original<br>
address, refrain from adding the second address, or coordinate the two<br>
addresses so that they are the same.  Failing to do so causes duplicate<br>
messages unless every person who replies to the message manually edits<br>
their send-to lines.  Normal Reply functions will tend to reply to both<br>
addresses.<br>
<p>
To test this theory, simply press "Reply All" (At least in Netscape and<br>
Eudora) to this message and see what addresses you send to.  You would<br>
expect to reply to me personally as I sent the message.  You would expect<br>
to reply once to the List which received the message, you might even see a<br>
copy sent to yourself depending on how your software is configured.  I<br>
think you will also see an extra address which also goes to the List which<br>
the List software inserted into the headers when it broadcast the message.<br>
If you do not manually edit out this extra address, you will end up sending<br>
duplicate messages to the List.  This is what is causing duplicate messages<br>
to occur.<br>
<p>
(Note that you do not actually have to send these duplicates!  After you<br>
have tested this theory, you can cancel the message without flooding the<br>
List with duplicate test messages!)<br>
