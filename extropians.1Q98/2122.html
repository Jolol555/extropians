"Freedom of choice does not apply to the mentally ill, IMO, just like it<br>
doesn't apply to small children."<br>
<p>
I have bipolar disorder (a medical disease of the brain, which can<br>
drastically affect moods, induce cycles of mania, depression and<br>
psychosis, and is very treatable with medication), and am technically<br>
considered mentally ill.  I still have freedom of choice, just like<br>
everyone else.  Although, when I'm psychotically manic (which doesn't<br>
happen very often), my personality(ies) gets extremely warped, and the<br>
result chooses to do things I would not and often wish I did not when I<br>
return to "normal".  I have no problem with the idea of someone<br>
restraining me when I am psychotic and ignoring "my" desire to make my<br>
own choices.  But I do have a problem with the idea of others<br>
constraining my choices when I am capable of choosing rationally (which<br>
is most of the time), simply because I am labeled "mentally ill".  Just<br>
because one is "mentally ill" doesn't mean they should be treated like<br>
children are.  Sometimes they should be, but each case is different and<br>
must be evaluated separately.<br>
