Me! Me! (Fx: jumps in the air wavimng arms excitedly.) I love the government!<br>
<p>
At least ... er, they didn't soak me for as much income tax as I was<br>
expecting this year. (Must send my accountant a bottle of champagne.)<br>
<p>
Or do you mean the concept of 'government' in general, rather than any<br>
specific administration?<br>
<p>
Seriously, though. If you look at things from the perspective of social<br>
darwinism, an argument can be made that Government -- as a concept --<br>
must have been, if not beneficial, then at least a functiona, rugged,<br>
and competitive concept at some time in the past. Otherwise it wouldn't<br>
be so ubiquitous today.<br>
<p>
I don't like facile generalisations like "government BAD" and "free market <br>
GOOD". Both institutions may bring benefits and may be open to abuse,<br>
depending on the specific implementation. What I want to know is WHY<br>
governments at the end of the twentieth century have become bloated, <br>
inefficient, and counterproductive monsters that are resented by many <br>
of their citizens. <br>
<p>
Anyone got any good ideas? (Preferably ones that haven't been hashed<br>
over until they're dead meat already; if the Extropians list is anything<br>
like it was in the old days, even _whispering_ the idea that government<br>
isn't automatically evil is going to induce a Pavlovian reaction among<br>
some of the less flexible libertarian subscribers.) Better still: anyone<br>
prepared to put on their Devil's Advocate hat and pretend to be a<br>
government employee trying to explain why what they do is _good_ ?<br>
