My business partner and I just did this recently while testing a web<br>
search function we were setting up.  The results were astounding. <br>
Between us, we are cited in no less than a half-a-dozen FAQ's for<br>
various newsgroups.  His movies and my writings are permanently featured<br>
on dozens of web pages.  We had no idea that we were "public figures." <br>
I encourage everyone to do a search for their own name and see what<br>
turns up.  You might be surprised!<br>
