Yak Wax &lt;yakwax@yahoo.com&gt; asks:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I ask this not just because it's a difficult question, but because</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropy has rationality at its core.  Now it's possible to think of</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational reasons for war, genocide, culling or anything else you</i><br>
<i>&gt; care to mention, but when a reason against it is called for we tend</i><br>
<i>&gt; to fall back on morality, ethics, and right and wrong.  These IMHO</i><br>
<i>&gt; are weak arguments against raw and unrelenting rationality, so what</i><br>
<i>&gt; defenses do we have against someone who's taken a very different</i><br>
<i>&gt; slant on Extropy?</i><br>
<p>
and "den Otter" &lt;otter@globalxs.nl&gt; continues:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Seriously...Wax has a point. Why are Star Trek (or My Little Pony)</i><br>
<i>&gt; ethics so popular with this allegedly rational crowd? It does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; compute @:-|</i><br>
<p>
	I can't believe what I'm reading here!  You guys have been<br>
seriously deluded by the irrationalist's claims about the alleged<br>
stark/cold hideousness of rationality.  Isn't it all a false,<br>
irrational, and completely backwards lie to insure the servivability<br>
of irrational memes?<br>
<p>
	First and foremost rationality seeks after the best that is<br>
possible, whatever that is.  This is the absolute stone cold rational<br>
fact!  Nothing can be any different, unless of course you're being<br>
irrational.  And it's not seeking after just the best for the one<br>
single best person, but that which is best for everyone.<br>
<p>
	Culling, hellfire/damnation, and all that stems from some very<br>
old and irrational religious ideas and assumptions.  False ideas like<br>
there are a fixed set of resources to go around to each individual,<br>
and the more people there are the less each person gets.  Or other<br>
false, hate provoking, ideas like there is some fundamental eternal<br>
unchangeable, unrepairable, "essence" or "soul", where all that are<br>
less than the (single or those less than me?) best souls, must be cast<br>
into hell or culled or whatever.<br>
<p>
	In contrast, for an extropian, it isn't what you are (or have<br>
done) that matters right?  It is what you can become or what you can<br>
clean up or make up for right?  There is no culling required for the<br>
stone cold rationalists.  Rather, the extropian wants to use her<br>
infinite resources (or seek to obtain the required resources) to help<br>
those that are lessor (or to pay back those that have been unjustly<br>
wronged by her) to be at least equal to herself as they desire right?<br>
Only this is perfect justice which is perfectly rationally compatible<br>
with perfect mercy...<br>
<p>
	Rationalists first and foremost want the best that is possible<br>
and use the best possible rational means to discover and seek after<br>
that for everyone!  Anything that deviates from this is faithless,<br>
despairing, stone cold, irrationalism and less than the best.  It is<br>
only the irrationalists that think they want, or think they must<br>
accept, something less than this best possible that are the faithless<br>
stone cold, hateful, evil ones - the ones that have been irrationally<br>
deluded into thinking that something less than the best is really what<br>
they want.<br>
<p>
	*IF* "My Little Pony ethics" are the best, don't extropians<br>
seek to find a way to achieve it perfectly for all?  If not, then we<br>
seek after whatever is better right?  The most rational way<br>
possible?...<br>
