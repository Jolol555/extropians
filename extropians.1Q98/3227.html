I don't know why I'm playing the side of the believer, but it seems like<br>
the underdog is always worth rooting for. Why are you supposedly<br>
open-minded people so into calling it the "Face on Mars" idiocy???<br>
<p>
(sorry if I over generalized)<br>
<p>
But it seems that until its proven one way or the other, you should at<br>
least remain open to the possibility that yeah, life MAY have existed<br>
there..  Perhaps its more complex than reducing it to a simple 50-50<br>
chance, but it seems like with any bold new discovery there needs to be an<br>
chance that something extraordinary might be true.<br>
<p>
I wish that I could put this into better words, it just seems like this<br>
whole thing gets reduced to fiction WAY too quickly. Lets wait to see what<br>
is found before calling it reducing it to the ideas of the deluded.<br>
<p>
By the way, as much as you'd like to think, our government HAS not been<br>
very straight with us in the past. In fact, our US Government has done some<br>
absolutely heinous things AND covered them up in the name of national<br>
security.<br>
<p>
deluxe - the delusional mad conspiracy freak! (-:<br>

<p>
and devils advocate.<br>
