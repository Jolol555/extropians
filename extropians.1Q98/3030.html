	I have to disagree on this point.  My personal perception of<br>
Pinker's "How the Mind Works" was that it contained very little writing of<br>
interest and Pinker too infrequently degraded the conversation into a<br>
discussion of his own personal politics.  The amount of actual factual<br>
information and even useful speculation and theory contained within could<br>
have fit into a text 1/8th the size of "How the Mind Works", and in order<br>
to sift this text out of the book you have to sit through endless<br>
pages of useless writing all the while searching for the small bits of<br>
gold.  This is unfortunate, as his book "The Language Instinct" was very<br>
good.  I am disappointed that he could not have maintained his quality<br>
with this recent work.<br>
