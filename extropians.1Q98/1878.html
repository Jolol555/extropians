Great, I'm enormously interested! And so are many other Europeans.<br>
Especially because this is a good way for the ordinary public to <br>
get aquainted with some concepts underlying transhumanism. :-&gt;<br>
<p>
But do you have any idea when it will be broadcast on European television <br>
channels (like the BBC or Dutch television) ?<br>
<p>
If I would like to order your book, can this be done at Amazon.com ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;it has been stunningly made and is deeply faithful to the theme I wanted to</i><br>
<i>&gt;address in the novel, that living forever is going to become a reality.</i><br>
<p>
Regrettably the most common view, also depicted in many movies and <br>
television series (including for example in "Raiders of the lost Ark" <br>
and many Star Trek episodes :-&lt; ), is that wishing to extend your <br>
life span is unethical and immoral. <br>
<p>
It puzzles me, that the term "obsession" is used in the title of <br>
the movie. I hope this is not related to the wish for immortality, <br>
implying that such a wish is psychologically unhealthy ? <br>
<p>
I recently wrote to a Dutch newspaper where an article quoted a <br>
theology professor (member of an European ethical commission! :-&lt; ) <br>
claiming that a wish for immortality is not acceptable. <br>
<p>
I stated that it is wrong to decide what is ethically acceptable <br>
based on a belief. A belief is just a faith, it has not been proven <br>
and can therefore be wrong. Furthermore there are many different <br>
believes. "When the church is going to decide what is ethically <br>
acceptable, we will have returned to the middle ages."<br>
<p>
Another professor (in philosophy) suggested that immortality will <br>
result in eternal boredom. He supported this with examples <br>
from Greek gods, who according to stories did suffer from <br>
boredom and envied human mortality. <br>
<p>
Yeah, real hard evidence :-&gt; <br>
I could just as well claim that goblins exist...<br>
<p>
Besides that, he missed the point, it is always better <br>
to have a choice than no choice at all. I want to decide <br>
for myself when I'm bored and want to end my life, and <br>
not let nature decide this for me. <br>
