<i>        &gt;John, you're being at least as dogmatic and simplistic as you accuse         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Brin of being.  </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
Throughout historic times and until just a few years ago the secret keeper <br>
and the secret finder were pretty evenly matched, that is no longer true. <br>
Yes, the underlining reason for this is indeed simple and it's one of the few  <br>
things I will admit to being dogmatic about, the power of exponential growth.  <br>
In general, if I increase the complexity of my  encryption algorithm so that <br>
it takes me twice as long to encrypt, I have made it not twice, but billions <br>
of times more difficult for an attacker to  break. The government has access <br>
to more powerful computers than I do, but not that much more powerful. <br>
A child's 50$ video game has enough computing  power to encode messages that <br>
would stump the governments largest  super computers for centuries. <br>
For the first time in  human history 2 people on opposite sides of the planet <br>
can communicate instantly in total privacy, and soon they'll be able to make <br>
enforceable contracts without anybody else knowing about it, and without one <br>
even knowing the physical location of the other.<br>
                     <br>

<i>        &gt;Earlier you talked about splicing into the network "they can't be         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;watching me all the time".  But they can watch the network cables.  </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
Watch all cables all the time, all of the billions of miles of them?<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;For that matter, the cables themselves might be 'smart'. "Help!  I'm         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;broken!  Come look at me!"</i><br>
<p>
<p>
But I already know the cables have that property, and I know exactly how they <br>
determine that they've been tampered with, and I know how they communicate <br>
that signal to Big Brother, and I know how the signal is authenticated as <br>
valid, and I've read all the internal memos that the designers of the cable <br>
wrote when they were  working on them and worrying about weakness'.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the projected openness isn't based on voluntary transparency, like         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;altruism; it's based on snooping technology being better than        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;secrecy technology.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I know, that's why it won't work.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;How will you use this secret? </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
I'd probably start by adding 5 or 6 zeros to the balance of my bank account,  <br>
then I'll make people I don't like look like they've committed some very  <br>
serious crimes, then I'll give myself a new identity with full documentation,  <br>
then reveal to the everybody what I've done (except for the name of my new <br>
identity), destroy the world's confidence in the network and watch the entire  <br>
rotten system collapse.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;a world of total encryption might well be vulnerable to a new         &gt;algorithm or a quantum computer.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If a practical Quantum Computer is ever built the world will change so <br>
radically that the fact that your encrypted mail can now be read will be the  <br>
last thing on your mind.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;And then there's the TEMPEST arms race.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't worry about Tempest because unlike wiretapping it's expensive, easy  <br>
to jam, must be done at close range and is not well suited for mass <br>
surveillance. All I need to do is ask when the Tempest truck will be in my  <br>
driveway, or just look out the window.<br>
