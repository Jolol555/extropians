<i>&gt;&gt; Hoover was soon 'hooked' on hard-core political pornography (including </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 'kiddie-porn' -- 90% of U.S. 'kiddie-porn' is under FBI or State </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; control).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Really?  Does that still apply?</i><br>
<p>
      As far as I know, yes.  It's a 'guesstimate', inevitably.  Here's <br>
      Rudolp Chelminski and Olivia Moussouris, writing in the June [1997] <br>
      issue of the Reader's Digest:<br>
      <br>
<p>
      "American authorities ... now work with an effective weapon: the <br>
      Child Protection Act of 1984.  This legislation authorized <br>
      aggressive police work and initiated a national programme of <br>
      identifying paedophiles in their communities.  Ray Smith of the US <br>
      Postal Inspection Service, which finds itself on the front line of <br>
      intercepting both domestic and imported child pornography, explains <br>
      how it works.<br>
      <br>
      "When we find out about child porn for sale, we go and buy some.  <br>
      Then we arrest the dealer and sieze his records.  After that we go <br>
      proactive: we take over his business and his contacts. "Sorry we've <br>
      been away" we say.  "Now here's what we've got for you."  If a <br>
      customer takes the bait, we grab him"<br>
      <br>
      These and other aggressive methods work. "Paedophiles have told me <br>
      they would never touch a kid in the States" says Patrick Yvars, a <br>
      Paris police commissioner..."<br>
      <br>
      [60 Minutes documented a horrifying case of such 'proactive' <br>
      witch-hunting, where the US Postal Inspection Service produced <br>
      tempting porno catalogues, and bought up mailing lists up to twenty <br>
      years old.  They mailed the damn things out.  One who responded was <br>
      a former Korean War Air Force pilot.  When his order was delivered, <br>
      it was accompanied by police officers with warrants for his arrest.<br>
      <br>
      He refused to 'plea-bargain' and instead fought the prosecution.  He <br>
      was acquitted.  When he obtained discovery of case documents, he <br>
      found that over a hundred people had been similarly entrapped.  Five <br>
      had committed suicide.  Many had lost marriages, families, jobs and <br>
      homes.  Lives had been ruined.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; If you read Hoover's -- aptly-named -- book 'the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Masters of Deceit', it's clear that he hates communism for all its </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; democratic and libertarian bits, ....&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What bits are those?</i><br>
<p>
      There's no substitute for reading Hoover's book to understand this. <br>
      Except for reading Thomas Sowell's brilliant text on Marxism.  The <br>
      communist dream (as distinct from the State socialist dream) was of <br>
      a stateless society, where (within reason) people can do whatever <br>
      they like and have whatever they want. Sond familiar?  It should do <br>
      -- it's what all of us want, isn't it?  &gt;:-}<br>
      <br>
      Part of the brief for PsyWarriors and 'Wars of Ideas' participants <br>
      is to understand the enemy's cause better than he or she does.  The <br>
      main difference between libertarians and communists is over the <br>
      'private property in the means of production' issue; and the <br>
      boundary demarcations between the individual and society.<br>
      <br>
      Why do you think so many brilliant people fought so bravely and so <br>
      well to realize the communist dream?  If we had a few thousand <br>
      Extropians with that degree of determination and ability, we could <br>
      change the world.  Maybe we do.  Maybe we will.  Maybe we're better  <br>
      off with a 'molecular' system of organization, independent and <br>
      autonomous 'cells' which keep separate for security reasons. Like <br>
      our friends in NTS, in Russia.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The extended authoritarian extreme-Right subculture of social control </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; freaks that Hoover spawned and bred _still_ plagues America (and </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; American 'law-enforcement'; and American politics -- especially Republican </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; politics; and the media).&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The "Vast Right Wing Conspiracy?</i><br>
<p>
      As an 18-year-old college student, Hillary was a Goldwater Girl in <br>
      '64, working hard for a Goldwater victory.  Barry Goldwater kept telling <br>
      the authoritarian Extreme Right (the 'Coercive Authoritarians') to <br>
      get off her case.  Now perhaps they'll believe him.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
      Hillary and I are Goldwater Liberals, you see.  And in our hearts, <br>
      the dream is still the same...  &gt;:-}<br>
