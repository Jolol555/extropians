<i>&gt; of the more speculative development scenarios. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; productivty and/or to be not very accurate. Automata must do the bulk of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the job.</i><br>
<p>
I am very interested the exploitation of resources in the<br>
near solar system.  The topic of water on the moon has come<br>
up at recent dinner parties and I have found that some<br>
others agree with me:  potential water on Mars is much more<br>
interesting than actual water on the Moon.<br>
<p>
Mars is closer than the Moon in terms of the energy required<br>
to get there.  From LEO to the Moon, the delta-V is 6.0km/s whereas<br>
to get to Mars it's only 4.5 km/s!  The trans-mars injection is only<br>
a little more expensive than the Moon but the huge savings comes from<br>
the fact that Mars has an atmosphere you can use to slow down.  The<br>
Moon requires you to haul a bunch of fuel with which to stop yourself<br>
once you're there.<br>
<p>
If you count the fact that fuel can be manufactured easily on the<br>
surface of Mars using the C and O in the atmosphere with<br>
only seed H and some simple apparatus brought from Earth,<br>
Mars becomes even more attractive.<br>
<p>
Now consider if a local source of H (water for instance) were<br>
known to be in a relatively accessable form near the surface of Mars,<br>
very little seed H would need to be shipped.  The place could bootstrap<br>
itself and make all the fuel it needed.  Not only that, but a whole<br>
host of well understood industrial chemical processes become possible.<br>
The regolith is nutrient and mineral rich.<br>
<p>
The Moon is a boring hunk of rock compared to Mars.  Processing Moon<br>
rocks for minerals will be expensive and extremely difficult to justify<br>
financially.  On the other hand, any raw material more valueable than<br>
silver would be worth shipping back to Earth from Mars.  There are <br>
plenty of possible minerals which would fit the bill if found.<br>
<p>
There are many other reasons why Mars is more suitable as a near-term<br>
destination than the Moon.  Tele-presence systems and autonomous<br>
robot technology are a long way off from being able to establish<br>
whole industrial sites.  Any serious industrial endeavor will require<br>
the most autonomous, smartest, most versitle and powerful machines<br>
around, namely human beings.  Mars is a far more hospitable environment<br>
for humans than the Moon.  For this reason and the reasons above,<br>
I would be interested in discussing the bootstrapping of Martian colonies.<br>
<p>
For more information on the above, begin by reading: The Case for Mars<br>
by Robert Zubrin.  He does an immense service in debunking a number of<br>
the myths regarding the difficulty and expense of mars missions.  He has<br>
mostly come around to the pro-private enterprise approach but I think he<br>
still (at the time of writing) over-estimated costs.  A 100% private<br>
venture run by seat-of-the-pants entreprenuers and pioneers could bring<br>
costs down even more.  With $/lb to LEO slipping through the $1000 mark<br>
quickly, the next 5 years should see a lot more action on these fronts.<br>
<p>
Is anyone here going to the Mars Society conference in Boulder this<br>
summer?  Also does anyone know of any mailing lists more specifically<br>
attuned to these topics?<br>
