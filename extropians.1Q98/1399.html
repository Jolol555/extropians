<i>&gt;Poorly.  The US does LDL/HDL ratios too.  180 is considered a</i><br>
<i>&gt;"desirable" cholesterol level in the way a 3.5 LDL/HDL ratio is,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but they're different. You can have a high ratio and a low</i><br>
<i>&gt;cholesterol or vice versa. There is a correlation in that a good</i><br>
<i>&gt;cholesterol level *usually* comes with a good ratio.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, 135 is in the very low range and would be like a 2 - 2.5</i><br>
<i>&gt;ratio in terms of risk.</i><br>
<p>
This is one of those things that demonstrates the ole  "too much of<br>
a good thing. A reading of over 200 increases your risk of heart<br>
attack, arteriosclerosis, and some types of stroke, a reading under<br>
150 increases your risk of liver cancer, lung disease and other<br>
types of stroke. So 170-190 is recommended.<br>
<p>
I got this from an interesting book called "The Green Pharmacy" by<br>
Ethnobotanist James A. Duke Ph.D. published by Rodale ISBN 0-87596-<br>
316-1.<br>
<p>
I think this is a book every Extropian would find usefull, it's<br>
full of excellent information and wonderfull anecdotes. When he was<br>
with the Designer Food program under NIH, they decided on the "5<br>
helpings of fruits and vegetables" a day bit. Duke suggests "five<br>
fruits and five veggies, seasoned with five different herbs and<br>
garnished with five different nuts."<br>
<p>
This book also has a whole chapter on fighting aging.<br>
<p>
He also points out that his vast medicinal plant database is<br>
available at:<br>
