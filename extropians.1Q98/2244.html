<p>
The problem with "The Outer Limits" -- old or new series -- is that it is<br>
basically science fiction horror -- i.e., what can go wrong with technology.<br>
I guess for dramatic interest, this must be done.  Else one winds up with<br>
stories wherein the technology is grafted on to the plot -- like many<br>
episodes of the "Star Trek" series, where the technology is just a<br>
curiousity and not directly relevant to the story.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My favorite part about the series is that each episode is written by a</i><br>
<i>&gt;different author and has a different point of view and different</i><br>
<i>&gt;characters.  Unlike Babylon 5, Star Trek(s) and X-Files, which are all</i><br>
<i>&gt;locked into the same characters and the same tired points of view, these</i><br>
<i>&gt;are different points of view every time.</i><br>
<p>
That can be an advantage.  I wish more big name science fiction writers<br>
-- Poul Anderson, Vernor Vinge, etc. -- would make it to the little screen.<br>
I am tired of seeing "Harlan Ellison" written over everything on TV that<br>
even pretends to be science fiction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It may be more effective to spread memes via a TV series rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual movies.  Then we could have a different author and story idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;every week.</i><br>
<p>
That's true.  Now we only have to sell the idea to a studio or network<br>
that is willing to invest in it.  Of course, a good movie might turn into<br>
a series too.<br>
<p>
Also, we might think of independent productions, which might create<br>
a following, if they are done and marketed well enough.<br>
<p>
We should also ry to penetrate other markets.  The Latin American<br>
TV market, from what I've heard, is the fastest growing.  Potential?<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
