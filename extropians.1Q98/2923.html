It is interesting to observe changing orthodoxies. Yesterday, I quoted an<br>
article with the claim: "But many other cells don't divide at all during<br>
adult life, including the neurons of the brain." Today, we have the<br>
following article:<br>

Studies Find Brain Grows New Cells<br>
by Gina Kolata in the New York Times<br>
<p>
begin excerpt<br>
<p>
For years, neurobiologists clung to a fundamental truth: once animals, or<br>
people, reach adulthood, they may lose brain cells but they can never grow<br>
new ones. There were a couple of exceptions -- in birds and rats -- but<br>
the thought was that these were peculiarities of nature and not evidence<br>
of a general principle.<br>
<p>
But now, in experiments that experts call amazing, that dogma has been<br>
overturned. Scientists have found that monkeys are constantly making new<br>
brain cells in the hippocampus, an area of the brain used for forming<br>
long-term memories. Moreover, they report, the production of new cells is<br>
squelched when the animals are under extreme stress.<br>
<p>
Experts say they fully expect that humans are no different and that they,<br>
too, make new brain cells in adult life. That raises the glimmer of a<br>
possibility of eventually treating degenerative disorders like Alzheimer's<br>
or Parkinson's disease and injuries, like those resulting from stroke or<br>
trauma, by prompting the brain to grow replacement cells, researchers<br>
said.<br>
<p>
It also means that neurobiologists must re-think their notions of how the<br>
brain changes with learning or life experiences. The new study was by Dr. <br>
Elizabeth Gould of Princeton University, Dr. Bruce S. McEwen of<br>
Rockefeller University in New York and their colleagues. "It means that<br>
there is a new mechanism for changing the organization of the adult<br>
brain," said Dr. William Greenough, a psychologist at the University of<br>
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who studies learning and memory in rats. Dr.<br>
Fred Gage, a neurobiologist at the Salk Institute in San Diego, said the<br>
implications were "fabulously interesting."<br>
