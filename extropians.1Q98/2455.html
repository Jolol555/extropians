<i>&gt;The reality is the person in question has been in existence since </i><br>
<i>&gt;conception and that what you call "prevention" is actually murder.</i><br>
<p>
Is any murder unacceptable?<br>
For example, I think it's quite acceptable to murder an ant.<br>
<p>
What is unacceptable to me, is murdering a sentient being against<br>
its will.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Again, hold it! that's your reality. A 2 week old fetus is not a person in</i><br>
<i>&gt;my book, it has the potential of becoming a person. Just like a highschool</i><br>
<i>&gt;student has the potential of becoming a scientist.</i><br>
<p>
The question is not "if a fetus is a human being", because it <br>
is, in a biological sense.<br>
<p>
The question should be : "When does a human being become sentient?"<br>
<p>
IMO a fetus is not a sentient being. And if the parent(s) do wish <br>
it NOT to become a sentient being, they should be allowed to "murder" <br>
IT, BEFORE it does. <br>
<p>
IMO it's even questionable if a newly born baby is a sentient being. <br>
I get the impression that a baby, less than a couple of months old, <br>
seems even less sentient than a dog. Furthermore it is commonly <br>
accepted to murder pigs. And pigs are claimed to be even more <br>
intelligent and sentient than dogs. Following this reasoning it <br>
should also be acceptable to murder babies. <br>
<p>
However personally, because of emotional reasons, I think we <br>
should draw the line at hte point at least before the moment <br>
of birth. <br>
And after all, I wouldn't kill a dog too (at least when I'm not <br>
extremely hungry :-&gt; )<br>
<p>
The most rational way however, would be to determine for each <br>
case separately if the baby in question has become sentient <br>
enough to claim the right to live. <br>
<p>
However what is sentient enough?<br>
And furthermore this procedure would be quite impractical and <br>
probably not fail-proof.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;What's so special anyway about the moment of conception that a 'person'</i><br>
<i>&gt;begins to exist there? </i><br>
<p>
I guess that most people who claim this, assume that a non-physical <br>
spirit is entering the biological body at this moment.<br>
<p>
