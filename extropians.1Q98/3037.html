<p>
  IAN: Silly argument. The relation is meaningful<br>
  only because the relation exists between two <br>
  DIFFERENT times. You just tried to find an <br>
  example of meaningful self-relation and did <br>
  so only by including exactly that which you<br>
  purported need not be a part of relation! <br>
  Also, the cat is always relatied to not-cat.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;If I were in a black void and the only thing illuminated were </i><br>
<i>&gt;a cat, I would say, without looking about for another comparand, </i><br>
<i>&gt;"That's Fluffy" (or not, as the case may be).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Fluffy is being related to the black void!<br>
  Fluffy is DIFFERENT than the black void. How more<br>
  obvious could it be? How more transparent can the <br>
  infection by the "same as" crackpot meme be? It's<br>
  causing you to make the most absurd arguments,<br>
  arguments that defeat themselves by 100%!<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;And then there's binocular vision: two perceptions of the same thing at</i><br>
<i>&gt;the same place and time, yet slightly different.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
   IAN: "Slightly different" is still different.<br>
   Good grief. All your cases against holistic<br>
   identity are actually cases for it!<br>
<p>
   Still wafting for an example of <br>
   a nonholistic identity.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The perfect "same as relation" would be a relation of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; thing to itself, but such a relation is a null relation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Therefore the prevailing atomist definition of identity</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is false, irrational, an clearly contrary to reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And yet everyone but you finds a use for it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: No they don't. They don't know what <br>
  they're doing... confused as you are.  <br>
  "Same as" simply defines the "=" symbol.<br>
  Is that useful? Yes; but it does not <br>
  tell us what identity actually is.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Identity is difference, and difference is holistic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;War is peace.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: If we did not know about good, <br>
  we would not know about bad.<br>
