  IAN: Sorry that I missed your reply. I looked <br>
  in the archive but did not see it before. I<br>
  thank you for your critique but at the same <br>
  time I believe it's not representative of my<br>
  analysis: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/meta.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/meta.htm</a> <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The most glaring leap I observed is the "necessity of divinity" </i><br>
<i>&gt;as I like to call it. It is the assertion that something about the </i><br>
<i>&gt;universe "just has to be" spiritual or mystical. This statement is </i><br>
<i>&gt;never explained or rationalized. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: I think that misrepresent what I say.<br>
  I've never said some part of the universe <br>
  "just has to be spiritual or mystical."<br>
<p>
  Most explicity, what I've done here <br>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/mystical.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/mystical.htm</a><br>
<p>
  is to carefully define what aspects of the<br>
  mystical experience are 100% unique from <br>
  normal experience, then refine those experi-<br>
  ences to a mathematical claim about reality,<br>
  and then test that claim with the physical <br>
  reality that we can all observe. I point <br>
  out that if the mystical claim cannot pass<br>
  that test, then it must be false. I conclude <br>
  that the mystical claim is valid, and is an <br>
  expression of a universal conservation law.<br>
<p>
  One need not address anything unknown, as <br>
  you suggest, to determine if my analysis<br>
  is right or wrong. All features of my <br>
  analytical test of the mystical claim <br>
  are within the set of the known.<br>
<p>
  If anything, this should be called a de-<br>
  mystification of the mystical. Indeed, the <br>
  run-of-the mill mystic attacks what I say,<br>
  claiming logic is antithetic to anything <br>
  that the mystical experience reveals.<br>
<p>
  I make no claim, or "leap," as you suggest <br>
  that I do, of any "necessity of divinity."<br>
  I fail to see how that critique accurately <br>
  applies to my analysis.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The general defense to this lack of rationalization is that </i><br>
<i>&gt;such divine affairs defy our abilities to rationalize them. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: But that's the opposite of what I say.<br>
  It seems to me that your addressing a stereo-<br>
  typical variety of mystic oriented claim, a <br>
  set of which my analysis is not a member.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;If this is the case then they fit securely in the realm of </i><br>
<i>&gt;Agnosticism, the unknowable. By "knowable" I mean phenomena </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the universe (multiverse) that can be independently verified </i><br>
<i>&gt;by a variety of observers. To me, it does not make sense to </i><br>
<i>&gt;construct elaborate "proofs" of something that is by its very </i><br>
<i>&gt;nature unprovable. Furthermore, is it not a paradox to assert </i><br>
<i>&gt;that one can use logic to prove the existence of something </i><br>
<i>&gt;that is allegedly transcendental?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Again, I think this simply misses entirely<br>
  what I've presented. The application of what <br>
  your saying to my work would be that we cannot <br>
  arrive at a sum from our measurement of physical <br>
  phenomena that equals zero. Now for the sake of<br>
  argument maybe we can't, but if we refine the <br>
  case of "is the mystical experience true or <br>
  false" to "does everything equal zero," which <br>
  is what I've done, then there are none of the <br>
  "transcendental" or "divine" aspects of the <br>
  analysis that you suggest there are.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Additional Note on Wiley's "The Nothing that is Everything"</i><br>
<i>&gt;I do not believe that Wiley's argument successfully proves </i><br>
<i>&gt;that infinity equals zero. What he has shown is that infinity </i><br>
<i>&gt;minus infinity equals zero, which I believe is an uncontended </i><br>
<i>&gt;point. I am probably reading more meaning into Wiley's paper </i><br>
<i>&gt;than prudence would dictate, but technically the universe is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;zero sum game in that (at least according to theory) there is </i><br>
<i>&gt;an equal amount of positive energy (matter, mc^2, and so forth) </i><br>
<i>&gt;and negative energy (antimatter, gravitational energy, etc.) </i><br>
<i>&gt;What evades me is how the zero sum aspect of the universe can </i><br>
<i>&gt;be construed to prove that something about the universe is </i><br>
<i>&gt;"divine".</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: I think that I explain (as does Wiley) why<br>
  zero is the cornerstone of the mystical experience:<br>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/mystical.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/mystical.htm</a><br>
  <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/infinity.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/infinity.htm</a><br>
<p>
  The point is what is "mystical" what is "divine."<br>
  It's an experience of integration with the universe,<br>
  an experience of the dissolution of the normal <br>
  finite boundaries that define our egoic mind. <br>
<p>
  Why is this so "mystical," so "antiscientific"?<br>
  I believe that that experience is not a halluci-<br>
  nation but is the perfection of intelligence,<br>
  and this super-intelligence has been locked<br>
  away in a closet of ignorance and it's time <br>
  to let it out and hear what it has to say.<br>
<p>
  I've listened to it says, and what it says is<br>
  that the entire universe is an expression of <br>
  equalibrium and universal conservation law. <br>
  I think this understanding it key to breaking<br>
  down barriers of space-time that will eventually<br>
  allow for faster-than-light travel - zero travel.<br>
  I don't begin to know how that would be achieved,<br>
  but understanding the zero sum of space-time is<br>
  an inherent prerequisite to such possibilities.<br>

 IDENTITY MATRIX | I D E N T I T Y    C O N S E R V A T I O N <br>
-----------------| The basis of  logic is  identity (ID). The<br>
     1  2  3     | basis of ID is difference. Degrees of dif-<br>
    _________    | ference can be quantified as ID units. The<br>
 1 | 0  1  2 |   | ID Matrix shows the ID units of three num-<br>
<i>   |         |   | bers,  and may do so unto infinity. The ID</i><br>
 2 |-1  0  1 |   | units of each  number are derived from the<br>
<i>   |         |   | others, and therefore ID is  holistic  not</i><br>
 3 |-2 -1  0 |   | atomistic. As the sum of all ID units unto <br>
   -----------   | infinity equals 0,  identity is conserved.<br>
