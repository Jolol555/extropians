<i>&gt; their privacy, in order to achieve your desired result.</i><br>
<p>
I was merely making a prediction so coercion would be clearly out of<br>
the question (I have no opinion on this subject or any other, and do<br>
not seek to enforce anything.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That's where I draw the line.  If people want to voluntarily give up</i><br>

same.<br>
<p>
And if it were coerced it wouldn't work, it would not be "open."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As long as you or David want to predict that society will voluntarily</i><br>
<i>&gt; move into a culture where there is no more lying, no more adultery, no</i><br>
<i>&gt; more secrets, and no more privacy, that's fine.  I'm skeptical,</i><br>
because<br>
<i>&gt; this would be such a total change in human culture that it is hard for</i><br>
<i>&gt; me to imagine.  Most of the conflicts explored in classic fiction</i><br>
would<br>
<i>&gt; become impossible.  (I accused David of wanting to make stories about</i><br>
<i>&gt; illicit sexual affairs the exclusive domain of science fiction writers</i><br>
<i>&gt; like himself.)</i><br>
<p>
Try looking at it from a different perspective.  Imagine a world where<br>
something like this has happened, and now look at our 'society' from<br>
that perspective, which is more radical?  And don't get me wrong, I'm<br>
not trying to stop people lying or being adulterous, this is just a<br>
prediction.  If anything people would be more 'adulterous' in an open<br>
society, we just wouldn't care anymore.  I think most people would be<br>
shocked (and in a bad way) by this future.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The problem arises when people become so excited about this marvelous</i><br>
<i>&gt; new world that they are willing to use force to get there.  I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; most of us would agree that these changes should be adopted</i><br>
voluntarily.<br>
<i>&gt; People should be free to expose more of their private lives to public</i><br>
<i>&gt; scrutiny, with the decisions being made on an individual basis.</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely, I agree.  The nature of the system is that if it is forced<br>
it will not work.  Also I don't think people will give up privacy for<br>
peace on earth, they'll give it up for the advantages the technology<br>
brings to them.<br>
