<i>&gt; In Germany, a politician from the Social Democratic Party recently suggested</i><br>
<i>&gt; to raise a minimum tax for</i><br>
<i>&gt; millionaires. Of course this half-hearted proposal will never be realized. But</i><br>
<i>&gt; it showed that millionaires and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the big industry which bores them do not have to pay a single D-Mark if their</i><br>
<i>&gt; tax advisors are good enough.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Even the thousands of students who protest against the low funds flowing into</i><br>
<i>&gt; education now use the</i><br>
<i>&gt; slogan "Tax millionaires". Futile, of course.</i><br>
<p>
SOME students. Talking of Munich, those students belong to a political<br>
group called "Linksruck" who are the worst communists I have ever<br>
encountered. Unfortunately, those people are a lot better organized than<br>
individuals like me, which has the effect that their voice is heard<br>
louder than those of many other students who don't particularly agree<br>
with what those people say ("Tax millionaires" is just the "top of the<br>
iceberg"...)<br>
<p>
I thought those "protests" were an interesting example of Spontanuous<br>
Order and Intelligent Technology (at least if you look at them from the<br>
right perspective):<br>
Spontanuous Order: there were a lot of different things that had to be<br>
done - organization (great challenge), public relations (the press was<br>
really really bad at the beginning, it got better after 2 weeks), events<br>
and so on. For these tasks, groups from different institutes gathered<br>
and some did a really good job (we even had a daily "newspaper")<br>
Intelligent Technology: well, unfortunately, people just are not really<br>
connected to the internet. Still, we managed to pull some of the<br>
coordination and information onto the internet, providing mailing-lists<br>
and a website (updated hourly). This did have quite a positive effect<br>
(many interested people managed to get in contact with others, many<br>
unclear points could be discussed etc). Another thing that helped a lot<br>
were cellular phones (in that situation, you hardly ever are reachable<br>
via phone if you don't have that) - again, the problem was that too few<br>
people have that.<br>
<p>
Oh, I almost forgot Dynamic Optimism: without it, you wouldn't even care<br>
to start anything like that ;-)<br>
<p>
However much it may have changed the world - I took great personal<br>
profit by the learning experience (which leads us to Self<br>
Transformation, right?)<br>
<p>
Have fun!<br>
<p>
later,<br>
