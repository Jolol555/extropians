I've mentioned before Jane Jacobs' theory that the economic ideal is<br>
free-trading city-states, but the military ideal (as shown by history) is<br>
large nation-states.<br>
<p>
I've just read Richard Posner's _The Economics of Justice_, wherein he argues<br>
that all societies have had economically efficient structures for their<br>
technology.  (Robin tells me Posner is not unique in law and economics.)  He<br>
goes into detailed analysis of case histories, but the simple argument is<br>
evolutionary: the societies which survive and grow are the ones which are<br>
equipped to survive and grow.  Especially hunter-gatherer societies,<br>
which had a long time to adapt to a limited spectrum of environments and<br>
environmetnal change.<br>
<p>
To me it seems possible that we have one of the least efficient societies<br>
ever seen on the planet, because of our rapid rate of change; still, while<br>
the convergence of the Western democracies may be because of a shared<br>
infatuation with semi-socialism, the welfare states may just as well be the<br>
natural balance at this time between growth and social order.  Or maybe<br>
it's because no one's tried a really efficient anarchy.  It's hard to<br>
know.<br>
<p>
I'm willing to consider the Communist countries a very failed experiment, not<br>
the natural result of economic forces.  I'm less willing to dismiss the<br>
structure of the West out of hand.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, such analysis offers hope that new technologies may<br>
change things.  Posner explains much about primitive societies by way of<br>
their high transaction and information costs.  (Literacy by itself may<br>
be a powerfully transformative technology.)  So modern technology may<br>
eventually create more congenial governments for us.<br>
<p>
On the gripping hand, we're hoping for evolution on the scale of<br>
decades or less, which may be a lot to ask of humans.  And at some point<br>
order and stability _is_ as important as growth, at least if growth<br>
depends on large complex societies.  I'm not holding my anarchic breath<br>
yet.<br>
