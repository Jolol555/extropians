I have been thinking about people's motivations lately.<br>
Not of all people, but the most adventurous, brilliant,<br>
etc. - those whose experience may be of significance to me.<br>
(And also of those who are not driven by the idea of progress,<br>
just to understand what they feel.)<br>
The goal is quite selfish - to understand what I personally<br>
should accept as a worthy motivation.<br>
<p>
There are some obvious drives.  Self-respect, power, money,<br>
recognition. They can't drive one too far though, it seems.<br>
Once you reach a comfortable level of these things, their<br>
supportive role is over.  They can still play a motivational<br>
role if one wants to get as much of them as possible, but the<br>
continuing motivation by goals that are no longer rational<br>
(and apparently are not analyzed) seems to be a serious<br>
weakness by itself.  I would recommend anybody in such<br>
state to stop whatever they are doing for these goals, and<br>
try to understand why they do it, and whether they should.<br>
<p>
I feel really sorry sometimes for the world's so called<br>
greatest people who keep running after power and recognition<br>
for many decades.  At some point, it seems healthy to liberate<br>
oneself from such need.<br>
<p>
There are some drives that may seem non-perversely endless.<br>
Such as desire to improve things for other people, or curiosity<br>
to understand everything that exists, and build everything<br>
worth building and experimenting with.<br>
<p>
Let's look at these things closer.<br>
<p>
Doing stuff for others has its negative points.  As an instinct,<br>
it better be overcome - I really prefer choosing my motivations<br>
consciously, just as I choose my actions.  It also fulfills a<br>
need for recognition and feeling of worthiness; I just talked <br>
about these.  In many cases, the desire to be useful stands in<br>
the way of personal development.  Working for years on a textbook<br>
on a subject that you know pretty well, or pushing forward some<br>
particular discipline are good for readers and the discipline<br>
(which is why they try to convince you that you should be happy<br>
doing it) but are actually detrimental to your effort to study<br>
the world as a whole.  Granted, some of such work can give you<br>
educational personal experience, and it's definitely worth doing<br>
once or twice, but I fail to see how a fifth textbook, a 20th<br>
theorem, or a 300th student can be of much personal use.<br>
<p>
Curiosity seems an insatiable thing.  You expand yourself, do<br>
new stuff, discover new goals, see what you can achieve and what<br>
you can do when you do - or do not - achieve, learn to play with<br>
your motivational structure, etc.  We _are_ limited though in<br>
how much we can discover and assimilate.  If you are _reasonably<br>
good_, you can discover N new theories - but with sufficiently <br>
large N, there seems to be an effect of diminishing personal<br>
returns - you get increasingly reluctant to spend the rest of<br>
your life to come up with another N theories.  You've had that<br>
experience before, and N or 2N, you still don't know the world,<br>
so why should you keep running the process that you already<br>
know too well?   If you are truly excellent in your exploration,<br>
things may seem still worse.  You discover dramatic new things<br>
in new areas that people can no longer understand, you discover<br>
new connections between new fields - and you get bored with each<br>
before anybody can understand what it was that you were doing.<br>
No sharing, no emotional support, no chance to learn from anybody,<br>
and no implementation for your ideas. It's pretty lonely at the top.<br>
<p>
When people - who do have some serious personal goals - mature,<br>
they seem to hit these issues.  Many people give up on useful work<br>
as both their field and their brain become somewhat stale, and<br>
they no longer have the gratification from achievement.  Some<br>
create an illusion of achievement, and hide in it.  Some settle<br>
in an area they know well, and have enough intelligence and<br>
persistence to be productive in it - but that means abandoning<br>
the idea of boundless and open exploration for unquestioned<br>
pursuit of a stable set of goals.  This also becomes increasingly<br>
difficult, as many fields that are currently on the frontier,<br>
are quite new, so they cannot have any settled old professionals<br>
in them.  The super-geniuses probably leave the observable world<br>
(I mean, one can see their projection on their observations space,<br>
they still seem to walk around and publish something, but their<br>
goals and motives are unobservable and unshared).<br>
<p>
Am I missing anything?  (I hope I am)<br>
