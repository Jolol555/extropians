Kathryn,<br>
<p>
Sorry, but English inherited *none* of its grammatical structure from<br>
either Latin or Greek, despite borrowing a myriad of words from each.<br>
Ancient Germanic, like modern German, and English itself in vestigial form,<br>
had three genders as well. The three-gender system seems to be as old as<br>
Proto-Indo-European.<br>
<p>
It's absolutely not true that "man" entered the language in the ME period,<br>
as a glance at any Anglo-Saxon (Old English) textbook will show. As Damien<br>
pointed out, the original meaning does indeed seem to have been "person" in<br>
general; witness modern German "man" (used as a pronoun roughly<br>
corresponding to the English pronoun "one"). Modern German "Mann" and the<br>
male-specific use of Modern English "man" are later _specializations_ of<br>
the word. Hence OE "wifman", which became ModE "woman", literally means<br>
"woman-person". BTW, the "wif-" part of the word is the same as ModE "wife"<br>
and ModG "Weib"="woman, wife".<br>

Linguistically yours,<br>

From: "Kathryn Aegis" &lt;aegis@igc.apc.org&gt;<br>
I think Damien wrote this:<br>
<i>&gt;I think I've read that Old English originally had another word meaning</i><br>
'male<br>
<i>&gt;humans' and that 'man' was originally restricted to its inclusive sense,</i><br>
like<br>
Ancient Greek possessed three genders:  masculine, feminine and<br>
neuter. When the resulting Latin grammer was superimposed over the<br>
Germanic roots of early English a few centuries ago, these three<br>
genders passed into English but not to the extent that other<br>
languages utilize them.  English is actually one of the more<br>
gender-neutral languages, and is highly flexible in accomodating<br>
non-gendered discourse.  The word that you are trying to remember<br>
probably came from a Germanic or Icelandic language, because Old<br>
English vocabulary bore a closer resemblance to the root languages,<br>
both in form and pronunciation, and most of our 'household words'<br>
(words that refer to practical objects) entered the language through<br>
repeated invasion by Germanic and Icelandic tribes.  But 'man' as a<br>
word did not enter the English language until the Middle English<br>
period, and I can find no evidence that it was restricted to the<br>
inclusive 'human'.  It actually had four or five meanings, many of<br>
which you will find in Shakespeare.<br>
I myself prefer to utilize the word 'human', as it precisely shows<br>
what stage of evolutionary development I am talking about:  Human,<br>
transhuman, posthuman.<br>
