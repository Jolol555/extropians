The trick is of course that with surveillance systems *all over* you'd have to<br>
know about, and then manipulate, all those that recorded your illegal actions.<br>
A very tough job, you'll probably get caught and then you're completely <br>
screwed (why was this guy messing with the files? -- ah, he must have<br>
something to hide!). Besides, there are many other forms of evidence<br>
(like forensics) that would have to be manipulated too. Yes it can be done...<br>
theoretically. Not many real people could do it. Down goes the crime rate :-)<br>
