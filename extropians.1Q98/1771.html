	Amen.  It's constant agony knowing so many people are not<br>
signed up and will therefore soon be dead.<br>
<p>
	Julian has been one of my recent heros.  I remember Jarold K.<br>
O'Neal being a hero back in my high school days.  Then one day I found<br>
out he died.  It broke my heart.  Does anyone know if he was<br>
preserved?<br>
<p>
	For that matter, is there a list, somewhere of who has been<br>
preserved?  I know this is non disclosed information from the cryo<br>
companies, but surely there are many people which have made their<br>
preservation public knowledge.  It would be nice to know who is on the<br>
list of publicly know preserved people.  It seems like a cryonics FAQ<br>
should contain such information about people who don't mind letting<br>
others know they were preserved (or signed up to be preserved).<br>
