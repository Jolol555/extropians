I'm more concerned at the impact of human-introduced ecological changes<br>
with vast unintended multipliers, like the appearance 200 years ago in<br>
Australia of alien flocks and herds with hoofs that shockingly damage<br>
delicate soils.  Native animals that evolved here have large soft cuddly<br>
footsies.  So now the largest island on the planet is being ruined at<br>
breakneck speed by erosion, salination and other horrid anthropogenic<br>
impacts.  (Not to mention the well-known bunny problem, as they breed and<br>
eat like... rabbits, and seem to enjoy calicivirus sprinkled on their<br>
breakfast.)  Maybe Promethean technology will be able to reverse this<br>
devastation, but meanwhile...<br>
