<i>&gt; &gt; Well, if this approach fascinates you (it repels me) you'll probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; enjoy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Greg Bear's new novel Slant. He even cites Extropians by name as</i><br>
<i>&gt; respected</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in one respect by the group in the book that thinks along the lines</i><br>
<i>&gt; you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; suggesting. (I know you're not necessarily advocating these means.) </i><br>
<i>&gt; There</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will be a review of Slant in Extropy Online very soon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why does it repel you?  Extropy is about rational thought, so what</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational reason have you got against human culling, genocide or</i><br>
<i>&gt; general murder?  Of course, you could argue that culling people is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bad idea because maybe you'll accidentally kill someone who would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been useful, etc.  But I'm talking about the act, what I want to know</i><br>
<i>&gt; is for what rational reason does this *idea* repel you?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I ask this not just because it's a difficult question, but because</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropy has rationality at its core.  Now it's possible to think of</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational reasons for war, genocide, culling or anything else you care</i><br>
<i>&gt; to mention, but when a reason against it is called for we tend to fall</i><br>
<i>&gt; back on morality, ethics, and right and wrong.  These IMHO are weak</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguments against raw and unrelenting rationality, so what defenses do</i><br>
<i>&gt; we have against someone who's taken a very different slant on Extropy?</i><br>
<p>
Surely they are just *pretending* to be all nice 'n' cosy &amp; fluffy...When the<br>
time comes the masks of benevolence shall be tossed aside to reveal the<br>
stern face of uncompromised reason. Them slick eels...<br>
<p>
Seriously...Wax has a point. Why are Star Trek (or My Little Pony) ethics so popular<br>
with this allegedly rational crowd? It does not compute  @:-|<br>
