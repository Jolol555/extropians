As someone who has actually read Brin's manuscript, let me summarize the<br>
thesis of the Transparent Society.  (1) Exhortations to be good have been tried<br>
for thousands of years by all major and most minor religions, and have had<br>
rather limited success in changing human nature.  (2) Mutual accountability,<br>
openness, and criticism have given us the low corruption of liberal<br>
democracies (30 years ago we had a Watergate; today we worry about the Vice<br>
President making fundraising calls from his office), relative safety from<br>
crime and terrorism, and scientific progress.  (3) Snooping technology will<br>
outstrip secrecy technology; encryption is no good if I can watch your<br>
keyboard, or read your computer.  And a world of secrecy, if that secrecy is<br>
not ironclad, is less stable than a networked society where everyone watches<br>
each other.  A transparent society is coming, the big decision is (4) whether<br>
we try passing privacy laws which the rich, the gov't, and criminals will<br>
ignore or bypass or whether we try to make everyone open.<br>
<p>
Also: criticism is the great antidote to error, but it is also one of the<br>
things people hate to get.  The danger of leaders is that they need it more<br>
than anyone, but can do the most to suppress it.  The fact that Western<br>
societies are nice places to live has a lot to do with our having forced our<br>
leaders to swallow more and more criticism.  And this has nothing to do with<br>
altruism.  John says the ideal world is one where everyone else is obedient<br>
and open.  Right; everyone feels that way, which is where transparency comes<br>
from: everyone picking at everyone else.  Mutual Assured Surveillance.<br>
<p>
And Brin would be happy if the masses could somehow retain privacy while<br>
subjecting the powerful to scrutiny; he just doesn't believe it.  And between<br>
general secrecy and general openness he thinks the evidence shows that open<br>
societies are ones people would prefer to live in.<br>
<p>
Thus Brin; now on to criticize.<br>

No, the fundamental mechanism of life is to maintain a material boundary<br>
between you and everything else, and to try to make more things into 'you'.<br>
As for information, humans love sharing it.  Privacy is a modern taste and<br>
luxury; most societies couldn't afford it.  And America has more of it than<br>
anyone, partly because we have so much space to have it in.  Our opinions are<br>
not absolute.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not only must we have control of what information flows outward, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; growing up and maturing is learning to select which patterns our attention</i><br>
<i>&gt; should be focused on by progressively blocking out more and more of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment.  The Transparent Society sends us back to infancy, a cacophony</i><br>
<i>&gt; of environmental input.  As you mature, you want your door locked, you want</i><br>
<i>&gt; isolation, you want time and space to formulate and test unique thoughts,</i><br>
<p>
The TS hardly sends us back to infancy.  It allows us to look where we please;<br>
it forces no one to look.  As for creative isolation, that is related more to<br>
seclusion -- the freedom from distraction -- than to secrecy, which is needed<br>
for trade secrets, which patents are a replacement for.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Transparent Society can only foster a monoculture as it spreads across</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world.  Isaiah Berlin, in "The Crooked Timber of Humanity" (1990),</i><br>
<p>
It's happening now: the monoculture of diversity, of cosmopolitanism.  Each<br>
great city is becoming culturally more alike: a place where you can find<br>
anything you want, be anyone you want to be.  The transhumanist endpoint of <br>
this process is a single species -- of shapechangers.  Who will not allow each<br>
other to kill or abuse other members of the society.  Non-members are up for<br>
grabs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Order" (1996) has written: "At the end of the twentieth century the concept</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a universal civilization helps justify Western cultural dominance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; other societies and the need for those societies to ape Western practices</i><br>
<p>
The basic conflict is that Western culture doesn't see itself as a culture.<br>
It sees itself as a bunch of individuals interacting according to minimal<br>
rules.  It doesn't impose itself on other cultures; it's just that its<br>
individuals are so much richer, and individuals from other cultures keep on<br>
defecting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; recognize it as such and resist it strenuously.  Efforts to persuade them</i><br>
<i>&gt; to open themselves to the Transparent Society will result in world</i><br>
<i>&gt; conflict.</i><br>
 <br>
Who needs persuasion?  We're launching commerical spy satellites and living<br>
high off of scrutinized networks; they're being shot and robbed by their<br>
leaders.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; rather the moral society:  "Aware of the controlling power of ambition,</i><br>
<i>&gt; corruption and emotion, it may be that in the search for wiser government</i><br>
<i>&gt; we should look for the test of character first.  And the test should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; moral courage."  The moral society is, in fact, the only possible answer,</i><br>
<i>&gt; for where does the will to hold accountable come from?</i><br>
 <br>
The moral society has been tried, and failed.  I know of no reliable test for<br>
moral courage.  And the will to hold others accountable is inherent to a<br>
gossiping species.  A far stronger argument against transparency is not that<br>
it will not work, but that it will work too well, as in in village and small<br>
towns... and small towns in America are wonderful occasional sources of<br>
scandalous behavior performed by the town leaders behind their closed doors.<br>
By those who have avoided being an equal part of their transparent society.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; accountability.  And how will the Transparent Society protect us from our</i><br>
<i>&gt; very real and menacing external probable enemies, when they can peer into</i><br>
<i>&gt; our private lives with unbelievable levels of detail?  This is a gaping</i><br>
<i>&gt; hole in utopia, that international agreements, global trade and creeping</i><br>
<p>
This is the thinking that wanted in the 1950s to make the US into a police<br>
state: "We must become like the USSR to defeat it."  It was Edward Teller who<br>
pointed out that openness was our strength, not our weakness; that the free<br>
exchange of information supported science, the markets, and responsible<br>
government; and that the benefits thereof would far outweigh any losses due<br>
to the KGB being able to wander around at will.<br>
<p>
In Popperian terms: he was not proved wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The end of the Transparent Society is bogus and so is the means to that</i><br>
<i>&gt; end, criticism to reduce error.  Criticism erodes the will, lowers risk</i><br>
<i>&gt; taking, leads to conformity.  Criticism to reduce error is a small subset</i><br>
<p>
Among bureaucrats, yes.  Among entrepreneurs it leads to the failure of the<br>
misguided firms and the success of the strong and adaptable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ignoring it, the will is sapped if it reaches the heart.  It's not</i><br>
<i>&gt; blunders, but direction that counts.  It's the difference between</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; for criticism is simply finding out who your friends are.  Scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; criticism these days has devolved to swiping dwindling grant money and</i><br>
<i>&gt; fleeting fame from each other.</i><br>
 <br>
Bullshit.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Transparent Society.  The flaw involves the idea that the masters of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world will altruistically roll over and play dead for the benefit of the</i><br>
<p>
Already discarded; there's no altruism.  Probably no coherent set of world<br>
masters, either.<br>

<i>&gt; scrutiny.  The Transparent Society, like all utopias, is an immature revolt</i><br>
<i>&gt; against nature.</i><br>
<p>
Individuals have lived with scrutiny for a long, long, long time.  Not being<br>
out of sight was the only real law-enforcement.<br>
