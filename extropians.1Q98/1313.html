I don't think it was the preservatives. It sounds rather like a big<br>
shift in food habits from a diet you were very used to to another diet<br>
which was significantly different plus an environmental shift to an<br>
environment where you presumably experienced a lot of stress and<br>
infections from other people. <br>
<p>
I think the dangers of preservatives are somewhat overstated. Sure,<br>
there are unhealthy preservatives, but they are nothing compared to<br>
the natural poisons in the plants we eat. Of course, this is heresy to<br>
many :-)<br>
