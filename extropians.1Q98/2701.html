I think "vi $MAIL" was too retro for me.  Unless he .locks it first.<br>

And Sasha brought up smart software which can negotiate appropriate protocols<br>
before it gets to you, also reflected in Vinge.  But as this is a list<br>
practically suckled on Vinge, let us not forget what else appeared in that<br>
book: an award-winning dramatic presentation of the interesting times which<br>
active content can bring you.<br>

Microsoft is not the Blight, cheap attacks notwithstanding, but the prospect<br>
of not knowing what my mailreader is up to is about as attractive as waiting<br>
longer for a graphical mailreader to load so that it can display the author's<br>
choice of font and color.  Me, I have Netscape 3 set to override document<br>
colors, although they forgot to catch &lt;font&gt; and table color codes.<br>

Somewhere recently I saw a contrast of the IETF standards process --<br>
implement, implement, debug, standardize -- and the W3C process --<br>
standardize, implement, debug.  It was suggested that IETF has a better<br>
record.  The philosophical relevance to us would be an analogy linking IETF to<br>
evolutionary rationalism and W3C to constructionist rationalism.<br>
