It seems to me that politics as practiced today has little to do with a <br>
free market economic system.<br>
<p>
At any rate, it is not possible to literally sell yourself. You might <br>
say that Bill Clinton was offering his "services" as President to the <br>
American voters. He was not running for Pope.  I didn't want these <br>
³services,² but I'm still forced to pay for them, unlike what happens in <br>
a free market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   They laid out a set of</i><br>

<p>
Yes, they pretended to be a model monogamous couple. But if you believed <br>
that, I hear the Golden Gate Bridge is for sale. <br>
 <br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The meat looks a little funny....and you ask about it...and are told "That's</i><br>
<i>&gt; none of your business"....are you going to buy the pizza?</i><br>
<p>
No, because I obviously have an interest in not getting food poisoning. <br>
I have no interest in the President's sex life. Actually, I didn't vote <br>
for Clinton, but it wasn't because he probably lied about various <br>
affairs. I don't consider this sort of lying any kind of big <br>
deal.(Perhaps it was/is to Hillary, but that's her problem.)<br>
<p>
I do consider the "big government" interventionist policies of almost <br>
all politicians a big deal, so I don't vote for them for that reason.<br>
<p>
Are you saying that candidates are obligated to answer questions about <br>
their sex lives?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Is the presidency more trivial than a pizza?</i><br>
<p>
The presidency is not trivial, but the extra-marital affairs of Clinton <br>
are. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I just happen to have a case or two of meat I picked up off this bull hauler</i><br>
<i>&gt; friend of mine a few months ago.  Since it's "none of your business" what</i><br>
<i>&gt; condition it is in I'm sure you'd just love to take it off my hands</i><br>
<i>&gt; j....cheap..</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or...if you¹re a vegitarian...that's ok...I was really lying about it being</i><br>
<i>&gt; meat.  It's really soyburgers....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; EvMick</i><br>
<p>
Really, I'm having trouble following you. Because I'm not concerned <br>
about Clinton's affairs, therefore I'm not concerned about food <br>
poisoning? Come on now!<br>
