In a message dated 98-01-27 20:40:06 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt;<br>
<i> &gt; Stock market is down....dollar is weak....</i><br>
 <br>
 Pardon? I thought the market and dollar are UP.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Story I heard on the radio on one of those "MoneyTalk" talk shows was that<br>
things were in a bit of turmoil due to zippergate.  I heard that the dollar<br>
was soft on the overseas market and that the stock market was down several<br>
hundred points attributed to our boy.  I've not been able to acces the net for<br>
several days now so I can only go by archaic means of communication available<br>
to me....sorry if it's innacurate.<br>
<p>
And I think that, being a multitrillion dollar entity...and my experience in<br>
the lag time between investment in a small business and when it FINALLY begins<br>
to make money...that Ronal Regan deserves more credit for the current state of<br>
the economy than does slick willy.<br>
