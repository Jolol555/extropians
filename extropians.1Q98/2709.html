Exactly why is it monstrous for immature teenage mothers to be<br>
encouraged to put their babies up for adoption where they can be raised<br>
in two parent homes with more mature people? I think it is idiotic for a<br>
teenage girl to think she is doing the best thing for her child (or<br>
herself) by trying to raise it without a father.<br>
<p>
Our prisons are filled with kids who come from single parent homes.<br>
Check the statistics. To encourage single teen mothers to keep their<br>
kids is bad social policy.<br>
<p>
I would have considered my mother to be grossly irresponsible and<br>
immature if she had given birth at age 16 and tried to raise me without<br>
a father. I would also have been very angry at being deliberately denied<br>
having a dad.<br>
<p>
I never thought I would agree with Jerry Falwell on anything!<br>
