<i>&gt; I use animated GIFs,</i><br>
<p>
But why? I've yet to see more than a couple of animated GIFs that are<br>
worth downloading. Most of them take an age to download and then sit<br>
there wasting my CPU time. I use Netscape for research while I'm <br>
compiling drivers, and the last thing I want is to waste 95% of my<br>
available CPU cycles on some pointless 'ain't this cute' animated<br>
graphic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;as well as only java that is usable on all major browsers (ALHPABrowser, </i><br>

<i>&gt;in the words of its lead programmer to me: "gracefully ignores java", which is</i><br>
<i>&gt;fine for a dumb terminal network environment.</i><br>
<p>
Except when you hit a web site which refuses to work if you don't run<br>
Java, but gives you a 'helpful' little 'click here to download Internet<br>
Explorer' button.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, I will remind you that most business on the web is done in a graphical</i><br>
<i>&gt;environment. </i><br>
<p>
And my web-browsing is under (cough, spit, ack) Windows 95/98 over a 256k<br>
link with a stonkingly fast 2D/3D graphics accelerator. But that doesn't<br>
mean that I want to waste 90% of the time downloading pointless images. I<br>
actually use the Net for finding information; and I want to find that<br>
information as fast as possible, not sit back and watch the scenery go<br>
by. Not to mention that I'm one of the people who do actually *buy*<br>
things over the Web, rather than just window-shop.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Those of you who are still stuck in ascii-land are WAY behind the</i><br>

<i>&gt;your Yugo on the Autobahn at 45 mph and expect me to slow down my Passat, &gt;Volvo,</i><br>
<i>&gt;SAAB, BMW, or even a Ferrari, down for you. </i><br>
<p>
No, you have the analogy completely backwards. Netscape with Java, Shockwave<br>
and all the other cack is the Yugo; my browser with all that disabled is the<br>
Ferrari. If I want some information I hit full throttle and blast through the<br>
Web to it, getting annoyed when some stupid 'neat graphics, huh?' site forces <br>
me to slow down.<br>
<p>
This, I think, is where Gibson's cyberpunk went hideously wrong. The future<br>
console cowboys won't be using slow, CPU-consuming 3D VR interfaces; they'll<br>
be reserved for the normal folks, and the hackers will be using command line<br>
interfaces so they can stay close to the machine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why, because all those cobol programmers reading their email in vi, browsing &gt;with</i><br>
<i>&gt;lynx,  etc on their 3151 unix terminals, who make $100,000 plus a year and need &gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt;shop from the computer are too stubborn to get with the technological curve?</i><br>
<p>
Depending on where I am, I read my mail with vi, pine, Netscape, Internet<br>
Explorer, Privtool, Microsoft Outlook (cough, split, ack), elm, /bin/mail <br>
or 'more /usr/spool/mqueue/df*'. I much prefer pine because it's fast and<br>
simple; I'm just too stubborn to waste my time with pointless fancy graphics<br>
when I'm looking for information.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Commerce on the net comes from selling unique products to many people. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Ascii is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;horrendous sales medium.</i><br>
<p>
Why? I want a copy of Adobe Premiere; what do I need other than price <br>
and availability?<br>
<p>
I mean, seriously, what do I gain from spending five minutes downloading<br>
some huge animated presentation when I just want to find the cheapest<br>
supplier and hand over my credit card number? Particularly when Netscape<br>
will probably tell me that I don't have the right plug-in, make me waste<br>
ten minutes downloading that, then after installing tell me that I have<br>
to reboot my machine!<br>
