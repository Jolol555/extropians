<i>&gt; or he (it, they, we) *becomes* a Power in the first place.</i><br>
<p>
But why do you claim that carnivores do not respect diversity? By playing my role<br>
as a predator, I encourage diversity in the animal populations, encourage the<br>
continued practice of evolutionary pressure to maintain the fitness of the herds.<br>
A herd with no predator quickly degenerates in a few short years into a sickly,<br>
weak, unfit population that something as a simple bad winter can decimate, while<br>
several cushy years encourage overpopulation of an unhealthy herd which becomes a<br>
health and safety hazard to not only other animal populations, but also the human<br>
population. Excessive deer breeding for example increases the population of deer<br>
ticks, which spread Lyme disease to the local human population, and the increase<br>
in their hoof and mouth disease quickly spreads to cattle, horses, moose, dogs<br>
(who will often eat deer excrement), and other wild canines.<br>
<p>
