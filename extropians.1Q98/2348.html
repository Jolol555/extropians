I generally define art as `engineering of emotions'.  eg: the<br>
creation of particular emotions at particular times, or associating<br>
an emotion with a particular idea.  This seems to cover most<br>
popular meanings of the term, from ancient poetry, through <br>
ideological paintings, up to modern `artistic' disciplines such<br>
as marketing and advertising.<br>
<p>
It is not yet a fully understood engineering discipline, of course,<br>
due to the large amounts of feedback that are generated from art<br>
that is currently in circulation.  Progress is gradually being<br>
made, however, especially in the musical sphere (eg: the Spice<br>
Girls, and that recent program that simulated the music of Bach).<br>
<p>
Since the human brain is, self-evidently, deterministic, I<br>
imagine that art will be increasingly automated over the next<br>
few decades.  Transhuman art - attempts to communicate between<br>
transhumans at the emotional level - is something else again.  I<br>
can easily picture different groups of transhumans being defined<br>
by the artistic clade they identify with, and hence the different<br>
basic view of the world they share.<br>
