<i>&gt; Ahh, the "copy paradox" again. </i><br>

<i>&gt; different conclusions when deciding if the uploaded mind is "you" or</i><br>
<i>&gt; "someone else", depending on how (by which criteria) we distinguish "you"</i><br>

<i>&gt; topic.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think we will be able to resolve it with any amount of knowledge.<br>
It is a philosophical problem, and fundamentally a matter of definitions.<br>
Do you choose to define yourself in terms of a pattern of activity<br>
(consciousness, memory, emotions, etc.), or do you identify with the<br>
specific instance of that pattern which is located in your brain?<br>
<p>
Essentially, this is a matter of taste, and no amount of evidence or<br>
testimony will be sufficient to change some people's minds.  No matter<br>
how fervently an uploaded person claims to be the same as he was in his<br>
original body, those who define him to be a different person will simply<br>
say that he is mistaken.<br>
<p>
What I do expect is that as the technology develops, belief in<br>
the effectiveness of uploading will become more common simply as a<br>
matter of pragmatism.  People who accept that uploading (and similar<br>
transformations) preserve their identity will have more options available<br>
to them, and so they are likely to be more successful.  As time goes on,<br>
this should encourage more people to adopt this position.  In the end,<br>
we will have a minority who are committed to their original bodies, others<br>
who follow some very "safe", gradual forms of uploading, but the majority<br>
will view uploading as no more troublesome than a form of transportation.<br>
