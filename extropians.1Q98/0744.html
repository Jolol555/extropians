<p>
My take on what it means to have an intuitive understanding of a topic<br>
(such as a physics theory) is that we understand it with the right<br>
brain as well as the left (in shorthand). So it is, often, the<br>
bizarreness of a theory that impedes this understanding, but I'd be<br>
inclined to separate that from the basic definition of intuition.<br>
<p>
Things we understand intuitively _seem_ more natural. We can visualize<br>
them easily. Since this is easier to achieve with "commonsense" ideas,<br>
it seems like ideas that resist intuition ("counter-intuitive" ideas)<br>
are less natural and commonsensical. But of course we know that<br>
commonsense physics (Aristotelian physics) is quite insufficient.<br>
<p>
When we think about a problem in Newtonian mechanics we have a wealth <br>
of mental models to apply. Newtonian methods allow us to think in 3-D<br>
which is easier for us. When we first meet relativity and have to try<br>
to think in 4-D, we boggle. Then when we've done enough problems to <br>
begin to have a pictorial grasp of those concepts, it gets a lot <br>
easier. <br>
<p>
QM is even more slippery but people who really understand it (I exempt<br>
myself) develop ways to think about quantum effects that don't depend<br>
just on the equations. Example: the development of Feynman diagrams.<br>
Feynman absorbed a certain class of QM theory so well that he found a<br>
graphical shorthand for solving problems in it, and this was a great<br>
step (the temptation to misuse "quantum leap" was excruciating :-) in<br>
everyone's understanding. <br>
<p>
Seems to me that the experience of learning something extremely <br>
counterintuitive so well that it becomes intuitive is valuable in <br>
itself for our mental development, even if we do not use it directly<br>
afterwards. Fits in with Boundless Expansion and Self-Transformation.<br>
