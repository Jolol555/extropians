<i>&gt; Also i heard that they have very bright and inexpensive light bulbs (and grow</i><br>

<i>&gt; companies are supressing it, kinna like the way oil companies supress</i><br>

Have you ever read Douglas Adams' book _The Long Dark Tea-time of the Soul_?<br>
There's a character (actually a robot) called the electric monk: he was<br>
constructed to believe things; anything you told him to, without question.<br>
He starts out in the book unable to move about because a malfunction has<br>
made him believe that everything in the world is a particular shade of<br>
pink, so he can't see anything else.<br>
<p>
Isn't it blindingly obvious that any major advance in energy production,<br>
which would instantly make a millionaire out of the first guy to get to<br>
the patent office, can't possibly be "supressed" by anyone, and the<br>
larger the corporation, the /less/ likely it is that there will be leaks.<br>
Hell, Texaco couldn't even keep secret that one of their executives<br>
referred to black employees as "black jelly beans".  You honestly think<br>
that same gang--and every other company--could keep secret an efficient<br>
motor?  And besides, it wouldn't be them who created it--it would be<br>
engine makers, and they have no love of oil companies; in fact, they'd<br>
love nothing more than to drop the price of oil to nothing to make their<br>
profits go up.<br>
<p>
There's a very good reason this "information" has never been leaked--<br>
because it never existed.<br>
