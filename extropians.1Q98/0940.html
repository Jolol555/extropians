Several people have posted questions about the recent cow cloning<br>
experiments. I think this is one of the original articles:<br>

Human cloning could now develop faster<br>
<p>
By Linda Carroll<br>
MSNBC<br>
<p>
Using egg “shells” from cows, scientists have created embryos from DNA<br>
gathered from a variety of other animals, including primates. The new<br>
research may allow human cloning to develop at a much faster rate,<br>
experts say.<br>
<p>
<p>
 NBC's Robert Hager reports Monday on recent breakthroughs in cloning<br>
procedures.<br>
<p>
<p>
THE NEW RESEARCH takes the cloning experiment that produced Dolly the<br>
sheep in a new direction. Now scientists are learning that it may not<br>
matter where the egg “shell” used to produce a cloned animal comes from.<br>
Rather, they suggest that a mammal egg “shell” contains only the<br>
machinery needed to spark life, not the information that determines what<br>
species will develop. If the work pans out, it may allow scientists to<br>
use eggs of one species as a “universal recipient” for the genes from<br>
another species — including humans, researchers from the University of<br>
Wisconsin said. The new research has medical ethicists worried. “Cloning<br>
experts have been saying we had some lead time before we had to worry<br>
about cloning human beings,” said David Magnus, an ethicist and<br>
researcher at the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania<br>
in Philadelphia. One of the major factors limiting the development of<br>
cloning was the inefficiency of the process, Magnus said. It took more<br>
than 270 tries before Dolly’s makers were able to create an embryo that<br>
matured into a sheep. Since it would be very difficult and extremely<br>
expensive to gather up that many human eggs, experts have predicted that<br>
cloning of a human being would be far in the future, Magnus said. But<br>
because cow eggs can be harvested cheaply and easily, one crucial<br>
barrier to human cloning may have fallen, the Philadelphia ethicist<br>
said.<br>
<p>
CREATING THE EMBRYOS The studies, which were described Monday at a<br>
meeting in Boston, come several days after Chicago physicist Richard<br>
Seed announced to the world his plans to clone humans. Maverick cattle<br>
cloner Neal L. First of the University of Wisconsin in Madison. While no<br>
successful pregnancies have been achieved using the technique developed<br>
in the laboratory of cloning pioneer Neal L. First, the eggs with the<br>
foreign genes did develop into viable preimplantation-stage embryos. To<br>
develop their experimental embryos, the Wisconsin researchers collected<br>
unfertilized eggs from cows. Under a microscope, the researchers<br>
inserted a fine glass needle into each cow egg and sucked out its<br>
nucleus, explained Tanja Dominko, now a staff scientist at the Oregon<br>
Regional Primate Research Center in Beaverton, Ore. After performing a<br>
similar procedure on cells from the ears of mature sheep, monkeys and<br>
pigs, Dominko and her colleagues replaced each cow egg nucleus with DNA<br>
from another species. Then, the researchers zapped the cow eggs with a<br>
small electric current.<br>
<p>
The electricity serves two purposes, Dominko explained. It fuses the two<br>
separate units — the DNA and the shell — into one egg. And sometimes,<br>
the electric shock is enough to jump start the development of the egg<br>
with its new nucleus into an embryo. Dominko and her colleagues have<br>
watched their cow-egg embryos growing in the test tube. When the embryos<br>
were seven to nine days old and about 100 cells large, the researchers<br>
transferred them to the uteruses of potential surrogate animal mothers.<br>
So far, none of the embryos appears to have implanted, Dominko admits.<br>
“We really don’t know why,” she said. “We have to go back and check the<br>
embryos to see if they have the right number of chromosomes, to see if<br>
they have any chromosomal abnormalities.” At this stage, “this is really<br>
just dreaming,” Dominko said. “I don’t know if it will ever go any<br>
further.” If the research does progress, it might provide a way to<br>
protect endangered species, Dominko said. The new research suggests that<br>
the molecular machinery responsible for programming genes within the<br>
egg’s “shell” may be similar or identical in all mammals. Not everyone<br>
thinks that the new research will lead to human cloning. The Wisconsin<br>
group still hasn’t produced a live animal with its technique, said Dr.<br>
Jamie Griffo, director of the division of reproductive endocrinology at<br>
the New York University Medical Center. “We have tons of good looking<br>
embryos in our in vitro fertilization lab and very few of them make<br>
babies,” Griffo said. “ I don’t think this is the next big breakthrough<br>
that will allow us to clone human beings.” Griffo himself is trying to<br>
find a way to use the egg “shells” from younger women to house the DNA<br>
of older women who have no viable eggs left. The New York Fertility<br>
expert worries that a media furor over the Wisconsin research will<br>
result in laws that limit experimentation with eggs and embryos. “The<br>
big losers in this could be infertility patients who want to be genetic<br>
parents,” he said.<br>
