From: "Mark D. Fulwiler" &lt;mfulwiler@earthlink.net&gt;<br>

<i>&gt;Actually, I heard a rumour years ago that Mr. Clarke had an</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest in young boys, so this is not something new. There is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence for this allegation as far as I know.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know about "young" boys, but in a Playboy interview a long<br>
time ago he essentially admitted to being bisexual. The picture<br>
accompanying the article showed him wearing a gold lame luigi. It<br>
gave me quite the chuckle.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I do wonder, however, why Mr. Clarke chooses to live in a third</i><br>
<i>&gt;world hell hole like Sri Lanka. That is odd. </i><br>
<p>
Despite it's political troubles, Sri Lanka is a beautiful place,<br>
and on his income, Clark could live very well indeed. The story<br>
goes that Clark an avid skin and scuba diver fell in love with it's<br>
tropical reefs which he experienced while on a vacation there. He<br>
also wrote the book "The View from Serendip" based on those<br>
experiences. He is also known to greatly admire the Indian culture.<br>
