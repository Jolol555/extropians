<i>&gt;Tinkering with human DNA to make Ubermenschen, or microcephalic clones for</i><br>

<p>
I agree.  My prediction for clones is that Dolly and other current clones<br>
will succumb to rapid aging and die of old age at roughly the same time as<br>
their parent.  DNA has telomeres on the end of them that act as null-genes.<br>
The ends of the DNA get lost through copying.   More and more of the<br>
telomeres are lost through repeated copying, until finally real genetic<br>
information gets lost.  I think this is the cause of old age and cancer.  A<br>
clone's DNA copy that comes from an adult animal starts off with a reduced<br>
telomere set.  It is already advanced toward the genetic loss that I think<br>
causes old age.  Thus, a cloned cell has the same number of replications<br>
left as did the original cell.  No increase of lifespan is imparted to the<br>
clone with current technology.<br>
