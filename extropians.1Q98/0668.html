John Koza has a variant of GA he called GP patented (strictly speaking, I<br>
do not see any difference in evolving code and data, for code is just data<br>
interpreted by an abstract entity). He initiated a school of evolving<br>
code trees of a Lisp subset, with sometimes interesting results.<br>
<p>
The good things about GA/GP is that you need just to formally specify the<br>
constraints, i.e. the results which you want to get. The method, in<br>
theory, would generate systems with progressively higher fitness, which<br>
ideally would met your specs fully. This might be useless for<br>
cryptosystems, but great for VLSI design and real-world control problems.<br>
Another cool things are GA evolved IFS for image compression, synthesis<br>
and artwork.<br>
<p>
I think what cripples current system is that the GA/GP system's metalevel<br>
(obviously only the fitness function should be sacred, orelse we float off<br>
into Never-Never land) is not open to GA optimization, which makes the<br>
resulting system limited, and brittle. A good GP must adjust at least the<br>
mutation rate and the coding to guarantee a certain kind of optimal<br>
fitness landscape (roughly, a small ball in genespace encompassing maximal<br>
variety in phenotypespace, while genespace being permeated by lots of<br>
neutral filaments (multiple nonlethal migration pathways out of the local<br>
minimum trap)).<br>
<p>
I think such systems are easiest to design as CAs, which coincides nicely<br>
with the expected (it'd better) future evolution of computer hardware. <br>
Random defect hit density for deep-submicron WSI considered, evolvable<br>
hardware must obviously favour tiniest dies possible -- CA cells. (Just<br>
for this time, I won't plug molecular dot CAMs here). <br>
