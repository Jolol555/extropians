There is a new science fiction novel that touches on the subject of a<br>
radical reduction in ecological diversity and its potential consequences. <br>
The novel is Dust by Charles Pellegrino and it is reviewed here:<br>

Begin review excerpt:<br>
<p>
The story is based on a deceptively simple question--what would happen if<br>
all the insects in the world began to die? <br>
<p>
The demise of whole insect populations removes essential functions such as<br>
pollination, fungal control and organic decay. While rivers choke with<br>
rotting carcasses, crops wither from lack of pollination and uncontrolled<br>
fungal growth. Eventually scientists conclude that humanity's last chance<br>
may be to re-introduce insects by cloning the only ones now<br>
available--those preserved in amber from prehistoric times. But time is<br>
running out, and Homo sapiens may be next on the list of extinct species. <br>
