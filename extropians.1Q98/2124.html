I would prefer to say there are *many* ideal extropian communities. I<br>
certainly believe that my current community (or family, or nexus) is ideal<br>
for me, and I know many who feel the same.  What's interesting is that what<br>
is ideal not only varies from person to person, but also varies for the same<br>
person over time.<br>

that it could then be quite obvious to us, as well.<br>

<p>
Well, it's funny you should ask. Surprisingly, there is some sentiment among<br>
us not to rename at all. We kind of like Phoenexus. There do remain some<br>
marginal parallels between our story and the mythical ash-bird. Okay, so we<br>
didn't burn up into ashes in Phoenix, but it was pretty goddam hot. And we<br>
spent a good number of years there at Alcor dealing with death (and sure,<br>
the hope for rebirth, if necessary) in as direct a manner as humans ever do.<br>
And naturally, the death-avoidance business being as lucrative as it was, we<br>
were pretty damn poor. So getting real jobs and real incomes in an area with<br>
real weather was a little like "rising from the ashes of our earlier life,"<br>
or something. (None of this is to say that we had a bad experience there.<br>
Quite the contrary. Our time at Alcor and in Phoenix was for all of us the<br>
most rewarding experience we'd ever had, and the long term benefits to us<br>
individually for having been there are only just beginning. We're now<br>
happily intertangled with so many of you wonderful extropian types<br>
specifically because of our advantage of position (being at the center of an<br>
important hub of extropian activity). What a gift to know so many geniuses<br>
and beautiful people so early in life.)<br>
<p>
Oh, and also, we're all "formerly burnt dead birds that recently rose up out<br>
of some ashes which were probably our own," as the saying goes. (Like I<br>
said, the mythical parallels are marginal.)<br>
<p>
The more compelling reason we might not change our name is simply that<br>
Phoenix is where this particular power-quintet first coalesced, so the name<br>
retains its historical meaning at the very least.<br>
<p>
However, there has indeed been talk about what we should change it to if we<br>
do change it. (Max -- your ideas aren't bad. I like ExNex better than<br>
TransNexus, but I also think the name we choose should have something more<br>
personalized and us-specific if we're to change it.) The best of this<br>
ongoing conversation was a message (read: brainstorm) Kip posted to our<br>
in-house mailing list back in November. I'm forwarding that message (with<br>
permission) to the list separately under the "HUMOR" meta tag. (We've always<br>
felt that hilarious brainstorming is the most productive brainstorming.)<br>
<p>
We might consider having a Nexus Naming Contest, if people were game. Maybe<br>
we'd offer some money (or something) to whomever comes up with a name we<br>
decide to use.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To return to the faulty idea of an "ideal" community, I should point out</i><br>
<i>&gt;that a bunch of individuals living together, while great for some, will not</i><br>
<i>&gt;work for others. For some couples, and for families, other models will</i><br>
<i>&gt;often work better. There are several Extropian family Nexi/Nexuses, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;that of the Heward Family (which, when everyone is there, includes four ExI</i><br>
<i>&gt;members, with the two youngers potential Extropians....)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
My usage of the word "family" has definitely changed since living in a<br>
nexus. And my understanding of the word "mate" has morphed as well. I think<br>
it's quite natural that extropians would regard these notions as inherently<br>
subjective and individually determined  And indeed, that is probably the<br>
most valuable aspect of this kind of arrangement for me: the opportunity to<br>
explore the boundaries of human relationships with other bright, extropian<br>
minds. Being single and (more or less) hetero, I've had motivation to<br>
discover which of the good things in life that are normally reserved for<br>
mate relationships can be had by the likes of me and other single<br>
transhumans.<br>
<p>
It turns out, much to my surprise, that *most* of the elements of<br>
relationships normally reserved for mates can be had platonically. I'm<br>
talking about hand-holding, hugs, back rubs, massages, and my personal<br>
favorite, head rubs. More generally, I'm talking about reciprocal love<br>
and/or affection, and about being committed to someone else's happiness<br>
(reciprocity again being the key) over a long period of time, and getting to<br>
reap the long term benefits of that commitment.<br>
<p>
I will say, the nexus isn't for everyone. Being an "extropian" can mean a<br>
lot of things, but it does not guarantee compatibility. I'm fortunate enough<br>
to have latched onto to 4 people who are *extremely* similar in terms of<br>
values, modes of living, preferences for entertainment, and day to day<br>
passions and habits. Philosophy is only part of that equation. Attitude,<br>
sense of humor, and personality are much more important.<br>
<p>
However, that is not to say we don't draw the line with some matters of<br>
principal. We are all Alcor members in good standing, for example. (I'm not<br>
sure if there is any other single household with as many as five bracelets.<br>
It might be a record.) And of course we are all dedicated hedonists. (I<br>
won't say which of these life necessities we rank as more important, only<br>
that both are mandatory.)<br>
<p>
We even started on a list of Phoenexus Rules, but never finished it<br>
(probably due to the overwhelming bureaucratiphobia from which we all<br>
suffer).  It started like this:<br>
<p>
1) Absolutely, positively no dying.<br>
2) Clothing is permitted.<br>
3) Thou art God (or something like that).<br>
4) But so am I.<br>
<p>
Rule 3 &amp; 4 were never agreed upon (I think they're why the making of the<br>
list broke down), but the sense of the nexus was that there should be some<br>
similar sentiment about self-ownership and self-direction.<br>
<p>
I think Damien and possibly some others here said they wanted to know more<br>
about the Nexuses (Nexi?). Was there something specific? Or just generally<br>
wondering how we like it and how feasible it is to shack up with other<br>
transmutants? If it's not clear from the above, I guess I should clearly<br>
state that each of us here gives both thumbs up to nexus life. (That's 10<br>
thumbs, and probably a few flippers and fins.) As far as I know, I've never<br>
met a person who lives in a more supportive environment than we do. (I would<br>
LOVE to hear of other's good experiences, though. I think happiness contests<br>
are win/win.) That didn't happen for us overnight. It took multiple<br>
extropians dedicated to seeking long term growth, aided by informed empathy,<br>
understanding, and insight. (And, oh yeah... talent and brains and skill,<br>
too. Or is that part assumed in the "extropian" label? One would hope so.)<br>
<p>
And time.<br>
<p>
If you have the opportunity, definitely give it a try. As always, your<br>
mileage may vary!  (Always wanted to take my turn saying that here...)<br>
