Recall in _Return of the Jedi_ when Luke meets Ben's ghost.  Ben says that<br>
Luke's father, Attican (sp?), ceased to exist when he was swayed over to<br>
the dark side.  Of Darth Vader, Ben says, "He's more machine than man--<br>
twisted and evil."  At the end of _Jedi_, a berserking Luke cuts off<br>
Vader's saber hand, and low!! it is artificial!<br>
Luke looks at his own prosthetic hand and realizes that he was becoming<br>
like his father-- more machine than man, spiraling enraged into the evil<br>
of the Dark Side.  When I saw it in the theater last summer, I found this<br>
movie to be very un-transhuman b/c of this and other subtlties (ie. reliance <br>
on "the Force" aka Faith, as a source of<br>
guidence) ruined the whole Star Wars mystique left over form my childhood.<br>
