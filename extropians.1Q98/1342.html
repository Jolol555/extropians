  IAN: In fact hemp seed used to be a staple<br>
  food product for livestock. Some activists<br>
  in my area raised chickens on hemp seed,<br>
  which was legally acquired from China. They<br>
  did a video on it called "Refer Rosters."<br>
<p>
  The chickens ignored all other feed and <br>
  ran over each other to get the hemp seed. <br>
  In the video they show the feed trough with<br>
  hemp on one side and the regular feed on <br>
  the other side. All the chickens go only for <br>
  the hemp, and go crazy for it. (You can find <br>
  hemp seed in some bird food at pet shops.)<br>
<p>
  The chickens grew almost twice as large as <br>
  normal chickens and their meat was graded by <br>
  a USDA inspector as the best he's ever seen.<br>
  Hemp seed is simply unparalleled in quality.<br>
<p>
  The funniest thing was that they took the <br>
  "refer rosters" to a local police picnic.<br>
  The police where really chowing down on <br>
  the refer rosters when they learned what<br>
  the chickens were raised on. But, don't<br>
  worry, as I'll explain, the police were<br>
  spared any experience of euphoric bliss.<br>

<i>&gt;On the other hand, hemp is farmed in the EU; it's not hard to breed a</i><br>
<i>&gt;strain of cannabis sativa that produces no intoxicating substances</i><br>
<i>&gt;whatsoever. (Although the cops tend to keep a close eye on farmers who</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a license to grow the stuff, just to make sure it's an approved</i><br>
<i>&gt;strain ...)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Most hemp has very-low THC, and I've heard <br>
  that in Japan there is a variety with no THC. :^(<br>
<p>
  However, the seeds of all varieties of cannabis <br>
  sativa and cannabis indica are 100% THC free. <br>
  THC is only produced on the outer surface of <br>
  the plant's leaves and flowering tops, found in<br>
  a clear sticky liquid exuding from leaf pours <br>
  and along and on top of small hairs where the <br>
  liquid builds up into little crystal-ball-like <br>
  "dew drops" called tricomes. This occurs most <br>
  significantly around the flowering tops, even<br>
  on the brackets that hold the seeds, but the <br>
  seeds themselves are 100% THC free as are all<br>
  interior parts of the plant, contrary to pop-<br>
  ular misconception. <br>
<p>
  People who smoke cannabis for getting high can <br>
  know it the pot is good by a simple visual in-<br>
  spection: if it has lots of the little crystal <br>
  tricomes appearing like salt on the surface of <br>
  the buds, it's good stuff, if not, it's weak.<br>
<p>
  The theory is that the plant uses the tricomes <br>
  as an insect and animal repellent, as they are <br>
  also high in terpinoids that give off a strong<br>
  smell and are toxic to insects, but not humans.<br>
  The tricomes are most prolific on the outer sur-<br>
  face of the flowering tops containing the most <br>
  important part of the plant, the reproductives.<br>
<p>
  One way that hashish is produced is having <br>
  people wearing leather clothing run through <br>
  fields of cannabis. The sticky tricomes on <br>
  the outer surface of the plants will stick <br>
  to the clothing and build up over time until<br>
  it can be scrapped off and rolled up into <br>
  balls of hashish, which is simply a mash of <br>
  almost pure tricomes, which is why it's so <br>
  much more psychoactive than the dried plant, <br>
  since only the tricomes on the outer surface <br>
  of the plant contain THC and the plant tissue <br>
  contains no THC. I did a report on cannabis <br>
  in high school is why I know a lot about it.<br>
