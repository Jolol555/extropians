He is not interested.  He thinks my ideas are weird.<br>
<p>
I skipped out of high school early because I couldn't stand it.  I took<br>
the GED and went straight to college at age 16.  My brother followed,<br>
but I don't think he felt the pressure to get out that I did.<br>
<p>
I chose an Science Education major, with minors in Computer Science and<br>
Biology.  He chose a straight Computer Science major.  I moved out from<br>
my parents, got a job and put myself through college, because my parents<br>
did not approve of the nontechnical portions of my college curriculum. <br>
My brother stayed at home, and let Mom and Day pay for his college and<br>
support.<br>
<p>
By the time we graduated, I had switched schools, gotten two degrees (in<br>
Business and Computer Science, with minors in Biology, Psychology, and<br>
Education.  I also had been doing computer contracts for 5 years.  My<br>
brother graducated with a single-major degree in Computer Science and no<br>
experience.  He was devestated when his first job paid less than mine. <br>
He had no idea that experience would be worthwhile, and fully expected<br>
his more technical degree to land him a much better position than mine.<br>
<p>
He has been content to serve his employers, only changing jobs when laid<br>
off.  I, on the other hand, have always strived to get ahead.  I have<br>
always had jobs where I serviced multiple contracts, and always<br>
developed one of these areas into a higher job to replace my previous<br>
one.  My brother still works for a fine company, but I now have a<br>
consulting firm with my business partner.<br>
<p>
The only early difference is that I became sexually active in my teens,<br>
and got into a lot of trouble for it.  I had to decide that I was going<br>
to choose my own life choices.  My brother seems to have remained the<br>
good son, and probably was a virgin by the time he married a couple of<br>
years ago.<br>
<p>
I think having to rebell, having to move out of the house and support<br>
myself for my goals, and generally having to make my own way has lead me<br>
to be self-sufficient.  My brother still seems to expect state and<br>
employer to provide him with opportunities as long as he obeys and works<br>
hard.  I no longer trust government or employers.<br>
<p>
My brother is slowly coming around to my way of thinking, but started<br>
out his life experience about 4-5 years after I did.  (We are 35 years<br>
old now.)  He still thinks nutrition is inconvenient, life-extension is<br>
unproven and speculative, and cryonics is science fiction.<br>
<p>
He thinks my constant striving for change to be strange, and actually<br>
complains that I change all the time.  He finds it odd that I used to<br>
eat meat, then I became kosher, and finally vegetarian.  He finds it odd<br>
that I searched various religions before finally developing my own<br>
philosophy for living.  He seems to interpret change as failure and an<br>
admission that one's previous views were "bad".  I have difficulty<br>
explaining to him that Christianity was great because it gave me<br>
purpose.  Then I questioned and researched what the Bible really said,<br>
and found all sorts of other old texts.  Then I researched more into<br>
history and why these texts said what they said.  Finally, I question<br>
any divine purpose in the texts and believe they were earnest attempts<br>
by early philosophers to explain the unexplained.  I didn't reject my<br>
former beliefs as much as I grew and evolved (or transcended) out of<br>
them.  Whereas I value change as a chance for growth, he fears change as<br>
a chance for loss or failure.<br>
<p>
Since genetics doesn't explain the difference, I must ascribe it to<br>
attitude.  Since early childhood environment wasn't much different, I<br>
must ascribe it to my reaction to the environment.<br>
